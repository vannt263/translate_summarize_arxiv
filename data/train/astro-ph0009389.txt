    "kinematic dynamo theory focuses solely on the mathematical solution of the induction equation , = ( ) + ^2 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are the velocity and magnetic field , respectively , and @xmath3 is the magnetic diffusivity .    in the dynamic regime , the velocity field can be modified by the magnetic field , so that the dynamic dynamo theory must then consider both the induction equation and the momentum equation = -+ + ^2 - p + , where @xmath4 is the molecular viscosity , @xmath5 the total pressure , and @xmath6 the external forcing term .",
    "the mean - field electrodynamics(mfe ) developed by steenbeck , krause and rdler(1966 ) through the two - scale approach provides essential insights into the relation between the statistical properties of turbulence and dynamo effects , namely , the @xmath0 and @xmath7 parameters of dynamo theory .",
    "let the large - scale magnetic field and velocity field be @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and the fluctuating components of magnetic field and velocity field be @xmath10 , @xmath11 , respectively .",

    "mfe in the kinematic regime gives ( see section 7.3 of biskamp , 1993 , and references therein ) = - < v > , = < v^2 > , where @xmath14 is the velocity de - correlation time .",
    "largely as a result of the development of mfe , the kinematic aspect of dynamo theory has been broadly understood .",
    "several monographs have been devoted to this subject(moffat 1978 , krause and rdler 1980 , zeldovich 1983 ) .",
    "but the nature of dynamo theory in the dynamic regime is still in debate .",
    "the back reaction of the magnetic field on the velocity field will modify the expressions for the dynamo @xmath0 and @xmath7 coefficients .",
    "the numerical simulation by pouquet ( 1976 ) was among the first to point out that with back reaction , to lowest order in @xmath15 the dynamo @xmath0 effect should be modified to _",
    "br = _ v + _ b where @xmath16 is the @xmath0 in ( 5 ) and @xmath17 is proportional to @xmath18 was called _ residual torsality _ by pouquet following field ( 1999 ) , we call @xmath18 _ current helicity _ in this paper . ]",
    ". this new term will reduce the classical kinematic dynamo @xmath0 effect to a certain degree . some early criticism of mfe",
    "was discussed by piddington ( 1970 , 1972abc , 1975ab ) .",
    "he argued that kinematic solar dynamo theories do not account for the removal of the large amounts of flux generated each solar cycle .",
    "recent objections to dynamo action have their root in the problem of small - scale magnetic fields",
    ". for astrophysical systems such as the galaxy , where magnetic reynolds number @xmath19 is large , some authors(cattaneo and vainshtein 1991 , vainshtein and cattaneo 1992 , gruzinov and diamond 1996 ) argue that the magnetic energy at small scales , @xmath20 , is much greater than the magnetic energy at large scales , @xmath21 , through the relation = r_m ^2 . according to cattaneo and vainshtein ( 1991 )",
    ", the magnetohydrodynamic turbulent dynamo will stop operating as soon as relation ( 7 ) is obtained , a process that can happen in much shorter time than turbulent eddy turn - over time ( kulsrud and anderson , 1992 ) . gruzinov and diamond ( 1994 ) base their argument on the conservation of squared vector potential for 2d mhd and magnetic helicity for 3d mhd , and claim that dynamo @xmath0 effect will be quenched in systems of high magnetic reynolds number as follows = where @xmath22 is the classical result in ( 5 ) .",
    "the numerical simulation with periodic boundary conditions by cattaneo and hughes ( 1996 ) supports relation ( 8) for the particular value @xmath23 and various values of @xmath24 .",
    "relation ( 8) is completely different from a previous estimate of @xmath0 effect made by kraichnan ( 1979 ) . he argued that even in the high magnetic reynolds number limit , the @xmath0 effect will not be quenched .",
    "rather , it has the following relation with the classical estimate , @xmath16 , and @xmath25 , ~.    kulsrud ( 1999 ) questioned the derivations of gruzinov and diamond ( 1994 , 1995 , 1996 ) by arguing that one of the their results , @xmath26 , for large @xmath27 , leaves out the contribution from @xmath28 completely .",
    "note that gruzinov and diamond derived ( 8) from the conservation of magnetic helicity , @xmath29 , which is based solely on the induction equation . in the dynamic regime , a velocity field that is constantly driven by external force will be modified by the growing magnetic field , a process that can not be wholly understood by using only the conservation of magnetic helicity . leaving this process out of",
    "the discussion of dynamo action is questionable , and a more complete account of dynamo theory in the dynamic regime must also consider momentum equation and the role of external forcing terms in maintaining the turbulence .",
    "field , blackman and chou ( 1999 ) considered a simplified model of mhd turbulence .",
    "the external forcing term in their model has the freedom to drive a mhd turbulence that is independent of the presence of any large - scale magnetic field .",
    "the turbulent velocity field and magnetic field were treated on an equal footing .",
    "their result on the @xmath0 dynamo effect depends on the statistical properties of mhd turbulence that are independent of @xmath8 , and agrees approximately with that of ( 9 ) but disagrees with ( 8) .    in this paper , we generalize the work by field , blackman and chou ( 1999 ) in the following two aspects : first , we relax the assumption made by field , blackman and chou that the de - correlation times of velocity field and magnetic field are the same .",
    "second , we relax the assumption in field that magnetic prandtl number , @xmath30 , is one .",
    "we also give brief discussions on how the nonlinear interaction between @xmath8-induced quantities ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 in field ) changes the final result for @xmath0 , and compare our result with ( 8) and discuss where the difference originates .",
    "this work can be considered as a generalization of field , blackman and chou ( 1999 ) , yet itself is complete and self - contained . to simplify matters ,",
    "we discuss only the dynamo @xmath0 effect ( not @xmath7 effect ) in this work by assuming a constant large - scale magnetic field , @xmath8 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , we discuss our model based on the work of field in section 3 and appendix a , we give our derivation of the coefficient of dynamo @xmath0 effect . in section 4 , we talk about the dependence of the @xmath0 effect on the kinetic reynolds number @xmath33 , the magnetic reynolds number @xmath27 and the magnetic prandtl number @xmath34 based on our derivation in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss possible modifications to our result in the presence of strong nonlinear interaction between @xmath8-dependent components of the mhd turbulence , and compare our result with previous derivations of the @xmath0 effect .",
    "conclusions are made in the final section , section 6 .    in table 1",
    ", we list the notations used throughout this paper . the physical meanings of these quantities are also explained briefly in this table .",
    "as in the work of field , blackman and chou(1999 ) , we consider only incompressible fluids . in our model , we first distinguish four different scales in the system .",
    "we denote the size of turbulence energy containing eddy as @xmath39 , and denote the dissipation scale of the turbulence as @xmath40 . for turbulence of large kinetic reynolds number",
    ", we have @xmath41 .",
    "an `` ensemble average scale '' , denoted by @xmath42 , is used to carry out the calculations of averaged quantities , @xmath43 .",
    "finally , we denote the scale of the whole physical system as @xmath44 , which is the typical scale for the variations of averaged quantities @xmath45 .",
    "so we have the relation @xmath46 . in our model , there are two large - scale quantities , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we assume both of these quantities are constant , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "we set our reference frame to that moving at @xmath9 and henceforth omit terms of @xmath9 .",
    "the presence of non - zero @xmath8 is related to the @xmath0 effect in the following two aspects : first , @xmath8 can be amplified due to the dynamo @xmath0 effect ; second , for large @xmath8 , @xmath0 effect will be quenched .",
    "next , we make the distinction between the @xmath8-independent components , @xmath37 and @xmath38 from the @xmath8-induced components , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in the absence of a large - scale magnetic field @xmath8",
    ", we assume that a homogeneous , isotropic , steady - state mhd turbulence be maintained by an external force , which operates at scale @xmath48 . to simplify matters ,",
    "we consider only the case that the external force is homogeneous , isotropic and helical .",
    "we further assume that within the scale range , @xmath49 $ ] where @xmath50 , the turbulence is largely hydrodynamic in character . this assumption can be justified if the external force , which is independent of the velocity and the magnetic fields , is the only external energy source to drive the velocity field . a homogeneous , isotropic",
    ", helical external force will constantly drive a homogeneous , isotropic , helical velocity field near the forcing scale .",
    "the equipartition between the velocity field and magnetic field is not achieved within range @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "rather , the kinetic energy within this range surpasses the magnetic energy , a phenomenon that has been found in many numerical simulations ( see below ) . from the scale @xmath52 down to viscous cut - off scale @xmath53 of the velocity field , equipartition can be maintained according to the mhd turbulence model of kraichnan(1965 ) or goldreich and sridhar(1995 ) .",
    "the simulation by pouquet ( 1976 ) with simplified dia equations shows that @xmath54 .",
    "simulations by kida ( 1991 ) with a spectral method gives @xmath55 .",
    "both authors obtained homogeneous , isotropic mhd turbulence with no large - scale magnetic field present , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "we denote the velocity and magnetic field in this kind of homogeneous , isotropic turbulence as @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and clearly they satisfy the equation _ t ^(0 ) = ( v^(0 ) ^(0 ) ) + ^2 ^(0 ) , and _",
    "t v^(0 ) = -v^(0 ) ^(0 ) + ^(0 ) ^(0 ) + ^2 v^(0 ) - p^(0 ) + , where @xmath57 and @xmath4 are magnetic resistivity and molecular viscosity , respectively .",
    "@xmath6 is the external forcing term .",
    "as we mentioned before , @xmath8 can be amplified by @xmath0 effect , and a growing @xmath8 will also attempt to reduce @xmath0 dynamo effect . to tackle this problem",
    ", we impose a large - scale magnetic field , @xmath8 , on the mhd turbulence of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and then follow the dynamics of the mhd turbulence system .",
    "@xmath37 will stretch @xmath8 , so that a new component , @xmath36 , of magnetic field that is dependent on @xmath8 , is generated .",
    "the new magnetic field , @xmath58 , will exert lorentz force on the velocity field so that a new component of the velocity field , @xmath35 , which depends on @xmath8 , is in turn generated .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 still satisfy equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) even in the presence of @xmath8 .",
    "this is because the change in the total velocity field , @xmath59 , is due to @xmath8 , while the component @xmath60 is driven primarily by external forcing term @xmath6 , which is independent of @xmath8 . bearing this in mind , and assuming that we have @xmath37 and @xmath38 already at our disposal , we write down the relation between the known quantities , \\{@xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath8 } , and the unknown quantities , \\{@xmath35 , @xmath36 } , as _",

    "the generation of @xmath8-dependent component of velocity field is due to the lorentz force that is exerted by the combination of @xmath36 and @xmath38 . in this sense , the terms involving @xmath60 and @xmath61 in ( 12 ) and ( 13 )",
    "can be considered as sources for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , thus the nonlinearity of @xmath35 and @xmath36 will largely come from the nonlinearity of the mhd turbulence , namely , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . therefore , we expect that the statistical properties of @xmath35 and @xmath36 depend on the statistical properties of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "in deriving equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , we made an important assumption .",
    "the validity of this assumption has been discussed in field , blackman and chou ( 1999 ) .",
    "the assumption is that the ratio of the decorrelation time @xmath62 of both magnetic and velocity fields , to the eddy turn - over time , @xmath63 , is small : < 1 . with such assumption , we dropped the following nonlinear terms : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "these terms are all smaller than the time derivative terms , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , the ratio of these two terms to the nonlinear terms that we dropped is approximately @xmath78 . we make this assumption because ( for more details , see also field , 1999 ) numerical simulations by several authors ( pouquet 1976 , kida 1991 , brandenberg 2000 ) have shown that the mhd turbulence within range @xmath79 $ ] for @xmath80 , is dominated by velocity field . in other words ,",
    "the mhd turbulence is largely hydrodynamic within this range , where most of the energy is concentrated . for pure hydrodynamic turbulence , experiments ( pope 1994 )",

    "similar results are also obtained by brandenberg(private communication ) . ]",
    "= 0.2 - 0.3 .",
    "therefore the time derivative terms in ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) are greater than the nonlinear terms that we dropped to get ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) .",
    "note that the assumption of ( 14 ) does not imply that the turbulence is of only one scale @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , the turbulence in this work can be of multiple scales .",
    "however , if the turbulence at scales @xmath84 is in approximate equipartition , its contribution to the electromotive force , @xmath85 , will be small because of the alfvnic wave - like motions of the mhd turbulence in the equipartition scales .",
    "in other words , we believe that the dynamo @xmath86effect to be discussed in the next few sections is mostly attributed to the turbulence within scales @xmath49 $ ] for @xmath80 , and various numerical simulations mentioned above support such picture .    in this work ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath15 to the rms of turbulent velocity , @xmath87 , can be of any value ; therefore we keep all terms that involve @xmath8 in the mhd equations for @xmath31 and @xmath32 . indeed , by keeping all terms of any order in @xmath88",
    ", we include the nonlinearity from the back reaction of @xmath8 to the turbulence . also , under condition ( 14 ) , our treatment of @xmath0 effect does not require any constraint on the ratio of @xmath25 to the rms of magnetic field , @xmath89 .",
    "thus the back reaction of @xmath10 on the turbulence is also taken into account in our model .",
    "this is different from classical dynamo theory that assumes that @xmath89 is smaller than @xmath25 .    in the following ,",
    "we assume that equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) have been solved so we have @xmath37 and @xmath38 at our disposal .",
    "in fact , we require only the statistical properties of these zeroth order velocity and magnetic fields .",
    "now , equipped with equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , and the known quantities @xmath37 and @xmath38 , we will be able to calculate the relation between @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 and , furthermore , calculate the electromotive force , @xmath85 and relate it to dynamo @xmath0-effect .",
    "the calculation is performed in next section and appendix a.",
    "throughout this paper , we define the fourier transform @xmath93 of a function @xmath94 as ( , ) = ( ) ^4_v _ -^+f(,t)e^-i(-t ) dt d ; i.e. , we transform @xmath95 both in time and in space .",
    "this method is similar to the one used by roberts and soward(1975 ) , and we assume @xmath96 throughout this work .",

    "in our derivation for @xmath0 , the de - correlation time for velocity field at scale @xmath194 , @xmath195 , can be different from the de - correlation time of magnetic field , @xmath196 , at the same scale .",

    "they are affected by molecular diffusion and magnetic diffusion , i , e . , @xmath4 and @xmath57 , by the properties of external forcing term @xmath6 , and by the nonlinear interactions between different modes of velocity field and magnetic field at different scales .",
    "we also generalize the derivation of the dynamo @xmath0-coefficient to include non - unit prandtl number .",
    "prandtl number is an important physical parameter . for many astrophysics systems , @xmath197 .",
    "for example , in the solar convection zone , @xmath198 ( childress and gilbert , 1995 ) ; while in the partially ionized warm gas of the interstellar medium @xmath199 ( kinney , 2000 ) .",
    "many past and recent discussions on @xmath0 dynamo assume unit prandtl number , which may not appropriate for real astrophysics systems .",
    "our analysis of non - unit prandtl number case shows that , for astrophysical systems such as solar convection zone where @xmath119 can be very small , the contribution to @xmath0 dynamo from kinetic helicity can be much stronger than the contribution from current helicity . in this limit",
    ", our result can be reduced to the classical result of kinematic mean - field theory , i.e. , the current helicity term does not play important role in determining @xmath0 .",
    "this can be seen from ( 73 ) by setting @xmath200",
    ". however , for the opposite limit , i.e. , @xmath201 , the contribution to @xmath0 from current helicity can be much more important than that from kinetic helicity .",
    "this means for astrophysical systems such as warm interstellar medium , dynamo @xmath0 effect will strongly depend on the current helicity of magnetic field of the system instead of the kinetic helicity .",
    "another possible feature of @xmath0 dynamo considered in this work is that , regardless of large or small prandtl number , there is no simple relation as for @xmath202 .",
    "rather , nonlinear interactions of the turbulence velocity field @xmath60 and @xmath61 will lead to finite de - correlation times of @xmath31 and @xmath32 so that even for @xmath203 , the electromotive force is not significantly reduced .",
    "this can be easily seen from the plot in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "@xmath0 calculated in the shaded areas ( horizontal or vertical ) is not dramatically quenched .",
    "such shaded areas span large parameter space of @xmath191 .",
    "hence , we believe that for large kinetic and magnetic reynolds numbers , the following relation is approximately true for moderate or large @xmath15 ( see expressions ( 56 ) or ( 59 ) ) . here , for @xmath204 , @xmath205 ; for @xmath206 , @xmath207 ; and for @xmath208 , @xmath209 . relation ( 79 ) is close to relation ( 9 ) , which kraichnan proposed in 1979 .",
    "indeed , our model is closely related to , but not exactly the same as , kraichnan s oversimplified model .",
    "a detailed comparison between our model and the model by kraichnan has been given in appendix b.    the derivation of dynamo @xmath0 effect in this work should be considered as an extension of the kinematic mfe to the dynamic regime .",
    "we use two - scale approach , but we treat the velocity field and the magnetic field on equal footing . our assumption of short time de - correlation ( see relation ( 14 ) ) has been proved by both experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "there are , however , the circumstances that condition ( 14 ) is not valid , such as the small - scale magnetic field amplification problem considered by kulsrud and anderson ( 1992 ) . in their work , when magnetic field is weak so back reaction can be ignored , the de - correlation time of magnetic field can be long compared with the line stretching time ; therefore , the nonlinear terms must be kept .",
    "kulsrud and anderson ( 1992 ) did exactly that .",
    "they assumed that the smallest time in the frame of their work is the turn - over time of the smallest eddies , @xmath210 , and the dominant effect is the line stretching by turbulent eddies .",
    "but their results can be valid only for small back reaction . in our model ,",
    "back reaction can be strong , and the smallest time is the de - correlation time of the @xmath8-dependent @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it is also possible to incorporate into our model the nonlinear effects from those nonlinear terms that we omitted in section 2 , if the de - correlation times of velocity and magnetic fields are long compared to eddy turn - over time . to aid our discussion",
    ", we focus on the case that @xmath8 is strong . in this case",
    ", the mhd turbulence can be treated as a bath of alfvn waves . in appendix b",
    ", we argue that in the limit of strong large - scale magnetic field @xmath8 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be regarded as @xmath211-driven , alfvnic wave - like motions . because @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be de - correlated within @xmath212 , the @xmath213-driven @xmath31 and @xmath32 will also be de - correlated within @xmath212 .",
    "our understanding of mhd turbulence is as follows : for statistically steady state of the mhd turbulence , the _ net _ effect of the nonlinear interactions between different modes of such wave - like motions , is that the kinetic energy and the magnetic energy will cascade from forcing scale down to dissipation scales and be converted to heat .",
    "therefore , to incorporate the nonlinear interactions between different modes of alfvnic wave - like quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 into our model , we approximate the nonlinear terms with linear , effective turbulent mixing terms , and re - write equation ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) as ( -i+ k^2 + _ ndk^2 ) ^_j + _ ndk^2^_j = i()(^_j + ^(0)_j ) , ( -i+ k^2 + _ ndk^2 ) ^_j + _ ndk^2^_j = i()(^_j + ^(0)_j ) . here",
    "we approximate the nonlinear terms in the ( fourier transformed ) equations for @xmath214 and @xmath215 with @xmath216 and @xmath217 ( see appendix b for more discussions ) .",
    "all of the nonlinear damping factors , @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 , are functions of @xmath152 .",
    "these damping factors can be calculated with closure theory ( biskamp , 1994 ; see also chen and montgomery , 1987 , or kraichnan , 1979 ) . in the limit of large @xmath222 ,",
    "compared with terms involving @xmath223 , the nonlinear damping factors @xmath219 in ( 80 ) and @xmath221 in ( 81 ) have significant contributions to the damping of turbulence only near the plane that is perpendicular to @xmath8 ; therefore , their contributions to the integrations with respect to @xmath224 are small and we omit them to get the first order approximation . under such considerations ,",
    "molecular viscosity @xmath4 and magnetic diffusivity @xmath57 in our calculations for @xmath0 in section 4 must be replaced by @xmath225 and @xmath226 , respectively , and the magnetic prandtl number in expression ( 73 ) has to be replaced by pr_nd(k ) = , and the @xmath227 in ( 73 ) must be re - written as _",

    "detailed analysis of the exact forms of @xmath232 and @xmath233 with closure theory or other analytic methods can be complicated and is beyond the scope of this work .",

    "many authors in the literature have suggested that for large magnetic reynolds number , @xmath0 effect is suppressed .",
    "our model does not consider the conservation of magnetic helicity .",
    "this is because we consider the @xmath0 effect as a result of the nonlinear interaction between homogeneous , isotropic mhd turbulence driven by an external force and a large - scale magnetic field , @xmath8 . in our model",
    ", the external forcing term has the freedom to drive turbulence that will interact with @xmath8 to produce a non - zero @xmath0 dynamo in large @xmath27 limit , while in the work by gruzinov and diamond ( 1994 , 1995 , 1996 ; see also zeldovich , 1957 ) , the velocity field is simply assumed to be given and no external energy sources are considered .",
    "this is not true for astrophysical systems where `` ... kinetic energy is constantly being injected hydrodynamically [ at the forcing scales].''(kulsrud , 1999 ) .",
    "note that the result that @xmath0 effect should be quenched due to the conservation of magnetic helicity in the large @xmath27 limit is obtained by assuming a steady state and a closed system . as blackman and field(2000 )",
    "point out , the assumption that a system is closed forbids a non - zero net flux of magnetic helicity to flow into or out of the system .",
    "in real astrophysical systems like the sun , the boundary is open , and magnetic helicity can flow through it .",
    "moreover , the assumption of steady state is not valid in many astrophysical systems where transient , impulsive activities , such as solar flares , can happen(chou and field , 2000 ) . with no assumptions of closeness or stationarity of the system , we believe the @xmath0 dynamo can operate under the nonlinear interaction between @xmath8 and the mhd turbulence , thus can be determined by @xmath8 and the statistical properties of the turbulence . a more thorough , though complicated , model of @xmath0 dynamo than ours should incorporate the boundary effects into the discussions .",
    "we generalize the derivation of the dynamo @xmath0-coefficient to include non - unit prandtl number and different de - correlation times of velocity / magnetic field .",
    "our formula gives @xmath0 as a functional of the statistical properties of @xmath38 and @xmath37 , and it is also a function of several parameters introduced in section 4 .",
    "we confirm the fundamental results of field , blackman and chou(1999 ) , that @xmath0 does not vanish at very high reynolds numbers , but rather obtains a finite value .",
    "there are two parts in the expression of @xmath0 : one is from velocity field , the other is from magnetic field . non - trivial contribution of either of these two parts can be achieved only when the prandtl number @xmath119 falls in certain regimes , but the total contribution to @xmath0 can be insensitive to @xmath119 if kinetic helicity and current helicity are comparable .",
