    "<S> there are cycles with three states and affinity @xmath59 , like the cycle @xmath60 ; cycles with four states and affinity @xmath31 , like the cycle @xmath61 ; cycles with five states and affinity @xmath59 , like the cycle @xmath62 ; and one cycle with six states and affinity @xmath63 , which is the outer cycle in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2a ] that goes through all states . among all these cycles , </S>",
    "<S> the last one with @xmath64 and @xmath65 leads to the largest value of the function @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified numerically that indeed @xmath67 bounds the ratio @xmath52 with numerical maximization and numerical evaluation at randomly chosen rates , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2b ] . </S>",
    "<S> the bound is saturated if the transition rates for the cycle with six states are uniform and much faster than the rates associated with the three links in the middle that are not part of the six - state cycle . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the multicyclic network corresponds effectively to a unicyclic network with six states . </S>",
    "<S> we have also performed similar numerical tests for several multicyclic networks that do not share any symmetry , and in all cases the ratio @xmath52 follows a similar bound @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> based on this numerical evidence we conjecture the following universal bound on the ratio @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> consider an arbitrary markov process with a finite number of states @xmath51 on an arbitrary multicyclic network . </S>",
    "<S> the cycles are labeled by @xmath68 , with a number of states @xmath69 and affinity @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the product of forward transition rates divided by backward transition rates over all links in the cycle @xcite . the affinity and number of states of the cycle with the maximal value of @xmath72 , defined in eq . , are denoted by @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , i.e. , @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath52 is then bounded by @xmath76 the basic idea behind this bound </S>",
    "<S> is that in a multicyclic network any two point correlation function can not have a larger number of coherent oscillations as the one determined by its `` best '' cycle . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the number of coherent oscillations is bounded by the thermodynamic force @xmath73 and the topology of the network of states , as characterized by @xmath74 . for the case of a complex network of states </S>",
    "<S> where identifying the large number of states in a cycle is not feasible , like in the activator - inhibitor model below , we can use the second inequality in eq . </S>",
    "<S> , based on @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we now proceed to illustrate this second main result in two models .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider a model for a single kaic hexamer along the lines of the model proposed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the assumptions entering the model , which is depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3a ] , are the following . </S>",
    "<S> a phosphate can bind to each one of the six monomers , hence the phosphorylation level of the hexamer varies from @xmath78 , with no phosphate , to @xmath79 , with all monomers phosphorylated . </S>",
    "<S> each of the six monomers can be either active or inactive . </S>",
    "<S> however , either all monomers are active or all monomers are inactive , since the energetic cost of having two monomers with different conformations is high enough to avoid such configurations . </S>",
    "<S> there are a total of @xmath80 states , denoted by @xmath81 for @xmath82 phosphorylated active monomers and @xmath83 for @xmath82 phosphorylated inactive monomers . </S>",
    "<S> if the hexamer is active , phosphorylation reactions occur and if the hexamer is inactive only dephosphorylation reactions occur .    </S>",
    "<S> the transition rates of this model for a single kaic protein are given in the caption of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3a ] . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath84 is the chemical potential difference of atp hydrolysis . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath0 sets the energy of a state that depends on the hexamer activity and on the phosphorylation level . </S>",
    "<S> if the hexamer is active the energy of a state @xmath81 is @xmath85 and if it is inactive the energy of an state @xmath83 is @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> this parametrization implies that the transition rate from @xmath87 to @xmath88 and the transition rate from @xmath89 to @xmath90 are both larger than the rates for the respective reversed transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92 are related the time - scales of changes in the phosphorylation level and conformational changes between active and inactive , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the phosphorylation level of the kaic protein oscillates with the number of coherent oscillations given by @xmath93 , as shown in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cycle with the largest value of the function @xmath66 is the cycle that goes trough all @xmath94 states with @xmath95 , which is marked with the red arrows in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3a ] . hence , </S>",
    "<S> for this model we have @xmath96 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3b ] .    for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath92 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the red dashed curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3b ] for @xmath52 as a function of @xmath59 . interestingly , while the number of coherent oscillations has a maximum , after which it decreases to zero with increasing @xmath84 , the entropy production from stochastic thermodynamics @xcite is an increasing function of @xmath59 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the number of coherent oscillations can also decrease with an increase of the rate of free energy consumption , which provides a counter example to the relation between number of coherent oscillations and energy dissipation inferred in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the relation between @xmath52 and the entropy production further in @xcite .    the maximal number of coherent oscillations @xmath93 that can be achieved in this model is strictly speaking less than @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> if a single molecule does not have a large number of states , several coherent oscillations can only be sustained in a system with many molecules as we discuss next in our second example .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the activator - inhibitor model from @xcite , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4a ] . </S>",
    "<S> the main components of this model are inhibitors @xmath97 , activators @xmath98 and enzymes @xmath99 that can be in four different states . </S>",
    "<S> the enzyme goes through a phosphorylation cycle over these four states , hydrolyzing one atp thus liberating a free energy @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the enzyme @xmath99 in its phosphorylated form ( @xmath100 ) activates @xmath98 and @xmath97 , whereas @xmath97 inhibits @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the enzyme @xmath99 must bind an @xmath98 in order to phosphorylate . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath98 activates the production of @xmath98 and @xmath97 , while @xmath97 inhibits @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> this feedback loop leads to oscillations in , for example , the number of species @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , there is a phosphatase @xmath101 that must bind to the enzyme @xmath99 for the dephosphorylation reaction . </S>",
    "<S> further details of the model are given in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> two important aspects about the behavior of this model are the following . </S>",
    "<S> first , the number of oscillations increases with @xmath84 and saturates for large enough @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> second , in order for different enzymes @xmath99 to synchronize their cycles , they must compete for the smaller number of phosphatase @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the total number of enzymes , as explained in @xcite . however , if @xmath104 is too small , the number of enzymes that synchronize is also too small to generate oscillations . hence , there is an optimal value for @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> these features are shown fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4b ] .    due to the complex network of states of this model we bound the ratio @xmath52 with the second inequality in eq . . </S>",
    "<S> the largest affinity @xmath73 is given by @xmath105 , which corresponds to a cycle where all enzymes @xmath99 go through their cycles in a synchronized way .    </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4b ] , the values of @xmath52 obtained with numerical simulations are approximately one order of magnitude below the fundamental limit set by our bound of @xmath106 , which gives @xmath107 for @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is reasonable , as saturating the bound in a multicyclic network requires transition rates such that an optimal cycle dominates , which is not the case for the present model . </S>",
    "<S> the realization of this optimal cycle in a stochastic trajectory would require an unlikely sequence of events that all enzymes @xmath99 go through their own cycles in a synchronized way .    for the case of a close to optimal value of @xmath104 that maximizes @xmath52 , the number of enzymes @xmath99 that synchronize is roughly @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , cycles with an affinity @xmath109 should be typical . </S>",
    "<S> guided by our bound , it is then interesting to compare the real value of @xmath52 with the estimate @xmath110 . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4b ] , indeed this number can give an approximate value of @xmath52 , typically overestimating @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the estimate is best for @xmath111 and for @xmath108 . for large @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> the bound grows linearly , while the real @xmath52 saturates . </S>",
    "<S> our results then indicate that this estimate works well in the regime where @xmath59 is close to its saturation value and @xmath104 is close to its optimal value . even though this heuristic argument is restricted to this model , if competition for some scarce molecule that lead to synchronization is present in the biochemical system , e.g. , in the model for the kai system from @xcite , a similar reasoning that leads to an estimate of the number of coherent oscillations should be valid .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have conjectured a new bound on the number of coherent biochemical oscillations for systems with large fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> our universal result depends only on the thermodynamic forces that drives the system out equilibrium and on the network topology through the cycle with the largest function @xmath112 from eq . . </S>",
    "<S> knowledge of the chemical potential differences and the network of states of a biochemical system thus leads to a bound on the number of coherent oscillations . as illustrative examples </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained the largest number of oscillations that can be sustained by a single kaic hexamer and analyzed the activator - inhibitor model , showing that our bound is also valid in models with a number of molecules that is large enough to make the network of states complicated .    </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be seen whether and how our bound can be used as a guiding principle to understand how systems like circadian clocks have evolved and to engineer systems with persistent oscillations in synthetic biology . finally , </S>",
    "<S> a rigorous mathematical proof of our conjecture about the first excited eigenvalue of a stochastic matrix is an open problem for the theory of markov processes .    </S>",
