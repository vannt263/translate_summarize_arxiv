    "it is well known that black  hole binaries make transitions among several distinct spectral states , mainly depending on their luminosity . among these transitions ,",
    "the best recognized are those between the soft and the hard states ( e.g. , @xcite ) . similarly ,",
    "neutron  star ( ns ) low  mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , consisting of mass - donating low  mass stars and mass - accreting weakly - magnetized nss , exhibit transitions between their hard and soft states , which are realized when their luminosities are lower and higher than @xmath4 of their eddington value , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the two states of lmxbs were often studied independently , broad - band suzaku data have allowed us to explain the lmxb spectra in both these two states using essentially the same three ingredients @xcite : a multi - color disk ( mcd ) emission from an optically - thick accretion disk , a blackbody ( bb ) component from the ns surface , and a hot electron cloud ( a `` corona '' ) which comptonizes the bb ( or sometimes bb+mcd ) photons . in terms of this spectral composition",
    ", the two states are distinguished primarily by a marked difference in the comptonization strength ( much stronger in the hard state ) .",
    "furthermore , the mcd and bb components both have generally larger radii and lower temperatures in the hard state .    in order to further strengthen the above unified view of lmxbs",
    ", we can utilize their spectral state transitions .",
    "that is , the identification of the spectral ingredients and the spectral decompositions can be made less ambiguous , by continuously tracing whether each spectral component in one state really transfers into the corresponding one in the other state ; thus , we will be able to connect the spectral modeling in the less - understood hard state to those in the better - understood soft state . as a result ,",
    "such attempts have been carried out by many authors @xcite .",
    "although the studies were often hampered by difficulty to catch such transitions which are rare and generally difficult to predict with a sufficient accuracy @xcite , some authors successfully detected transitions ( e.g. , @xcite ) utilizing , for example , rxte , and found continuous changes of the spectral parameters . in the present study",
    ", we attempt to update these results using improved instruments .    for the above purpose , the suzaku observatory , with its broad energy coverage ,",
    "is particularly suited .",
    "we hence searched the suzaku archive for a suitable data set , and found an ideal one .",
    "namely , a suzaku observation of aquila x-1 , made on 2011 october 21 for a gross duration of 79.9  ks in a rising phase of an outburst , very fortunately caught a hard - to - soft spectral transition of this typical recurrent lmxb .",
    "aquila x-1 ( hereafter aql x-1 ) repeats outbursts , in which the 210 kev flux increases by a factor of @xmath5 @xcite , and is associated with an optical counterpart with a magnitude of @xmath615@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it exhibits type i bursts , by which the distance has been constrained to be 4.45.9 kpc assuming that the burst peak luminosity reaches the eddington luminosity for an assumed ns mass of 1.4 @xmath8 @xcite . in the present paper , we analyzed this precious data set , employing a distance of @xmath9  kpc @xcite .",

    "the source was placed at the `` xis nominal '' position . to reduce pile  up effects , the xis was operated in the 1/4 window mode with a read  out time of 2.0  s. furthermore , the burst mode option was employed , in which the data are accumulated only for 0.5  s per the 2.0  s read - out time .",
    "we utilized the xis 0 and xis 3 events of grade 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 .",

    "the source was detected significantly with hxd - gso over p0p4 , but not in p5p9 . in analyzing the p0p4 spectra , we hence utilize the hxd  gso data up to an energy where the signal becomes comparable to that of the systematic nxb uncertainty @xcite .",

    "as constructed above , we added an analytical cxb model @xcite expressed as    @xmath29 , + where the units are @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the energy in kev .",

    "as expected , the softer and harder parts of the continuum were reproduced by the diskbb and nthcomp components , respectively .",
    "in addition , the mcd component clearly became more dominant from p0 to p9 , while the comptonization component became weaker with decreasing cutoff energy , indicating a decrease in @xmath33 .",
    "the obtained model parameters are summarized in table [ table : parameters1 ] ( after incorporating the iron line ; subsection [ sec : fit2 ] ) , and plotted in figure [ fig : parameters_plots ] against the time ( panels a ",

    "finally , the luminosity carried by the comptonization process , @xmath40 , was derived by subtracting @xmath39 calculated above from the 0.1100  kev luminosity of nthcomp .",
    "figure [ fig : parameters_plots ] reveals several important properties of the transition . first , throughout p0p9 , we confirm @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which makes the model physically reasonable .",
    "second , the parameters from p0p3 are consistent with those obtained by sakurai et al .",
    "( 2014 ) from aql x-1 in its hard state , and those from p8p9 agree with the soft - state parameters of this object @xcite .",
    "third , the parameters changed continuously and monotonically from the hard to the soft state .",
    "fourth , @xmath39 keeps a constant fraction ( @xmath43 ) of the total luminosity @xmath44 , as predicted by the virial theorem ( the deviation from the rigorous prediction of 50% is considered in section [ sec : budget ] ) .",
    "finally , the transition is mainly characterized by a monotonic decrease in @xmath40 and the associated increase in @xmath45 , as reflected most directly in the increase of the xis count rate and the decrease of the hxd signal ( figure [ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "this agrees with the theoretical picture of the hard - to - soft transition ; the inner accretion flow changes from an optically - thin / geometrically - thick corona to the optically - thick / geometrically - thin disk .",
    "let us examine whether the transitions are reproducible from one outburst to another , putting aside the hysteresis between the rising and declining phases .",
    "figure 14 in @xcite shows that the hard - to - soft state transition of aql x-1 in 2000 took place within @xmath46 day which is consistent with our result of @xmath15  ks ( @xmath47 hours ) and with those of @xcite ( discussed in section [ sec : timescale ] in detail ) . in the hard - to - soft transition of @xcite ,",
    "the total luminosity increased from @xmath48  erg s@xmath3 to @xmath49  erg s@xmath3 , which coincides with the values we obtained in table [ table : luminosities ] .",
    "furthermore , in figure 8 of @xcite , the ratio of the comptonized blackbody luminosity ( corresponding with @xmath50 ) to the thermal component luminosity ( corresponding with @xmath45 ) , decreased from 0.8 to 0.5 , again in good agreement with table [ table : luminosities ] .",
    "thus , the rapid but continuous spectral changes seen over p4p7 of the present data are considered to represent essentially the same phenomenon as the transition caught by @xcite .      in figure",
    "[ fig : residuals1 ] , residuals in most of the fits reveal a broad positive structure at 6.66.9  kev .",

    "during an 80 ks of pointing with suzaku onto aql x-1 while the source was in the rising phase of an outburst , a complete hard - to - soft state transition was captured .",
    "although the transition involved a drastic spectral hardening , the broad - band ( typically 0.860 kev ) spectrum was reproduced , throughout the event , with the same diskbb+nthcomp+diskline model .",
    "the obtained parameters evolved continuously as in figure [ fig : parameters_plots ] .",
    "as indicated by table [ table : luminosities ] , the total luminosity increased monotonically from @xmath126 erg s@xmath3 to @xmath127 erg s@xmath3 , which fall on the typical boundary of the hard - to - soft state transition as discussed in the last paragraph of section [ sec : fit1 ] . to be more specific , these values are even higher by a factor of 2 - 3 than those measured in the soft state ( @xmath128 erg s@xmath3 ) before a soft  to  hard state transition @xcite .",
    "this inversion is considered to be a hysteresis effect of spectral transition @xcite .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)tinl_rin3_2.eps    as shown in figure [ fig : parameters_plots ] , this precious observation containing the transition has allowed us to directly trace the spectral evolution from the hard to the soft state .",
    "as summarized in figure [ fig : parameters_plots ] , the model parameters changed continuously from typical hard - state values ( e.g. , @xcite ) to those typical of the soft state of this and similar sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this confirms that the model components in the hard state are identical to their counterparts in the soft state , and provides a support to our interpretation of the less - understood hard state @xcite in reference to the better - established picture of the soft state ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the transition can be characterized in a straightforward way by the changes of the three luminosities , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath45 ( figure [ fig : parameters_plots ] d ) .",
    "as already pointed out in section [ sec : fit1 ] , these changes can be understood as a process wherein an increased cooling rate causes the outermost part of the coronal flow to progressively change into the innermost region of the optically - thick accretion disk .",
    "in fact , @xmath24 , which is considered to represent the disk  to  corona boundary , decreased from @xmath15  km to @xmath129  km , accompanied by a decrease of @xmath27 from 10  kev to 3  kev .",
    "these changes are also reflected in the decrease of @xmath26 from @xmath130  km to @xmath131  km ; the accretion in the hard state was occurring rather spherically onto the ns from an inflated corona , whereas that in the soft state became limited to the ns equator as the corona gradually shrank .",
    "we further investigate whether or not the post - transition disk actually continues down to the ns surface . in figure",
    "[ fig : parameters_plots ] , @xmath24 approached @xmath129  km ( for @xmath36 ) , or @xmath132  km ( for @xmath133 ) .",
    "since these are larger than both @xmath134 and the innermost stable circular orbit ( which is also @xmath130  km for a ns with 1.4 m@xmath135 ) , the disk is likely to be truncated . because any magnetosphere effect would appear at much lower luminosities ( @xmath136  erg s@xmath3 ; @xcite ) , the truncation , if true , is likely to be caused by the spontaneous change in the accretion flow , just like in the hard state .",
    "however , we are still left with a possibility that the disk actually reaches @xmath134 ( or the innermost stable circular orbit ) , and yet its innermost region ( e.g. , from @xmath130  km to @xmath129  km ) is covered by the optically - thick corona to become directly invisible .",
    "thus , it is rather difficult to conclude whether the disk reaches the ns surface or not .",
    "let us examine our premise that the disk can be regarded as a standard accretion disk .",
    "if this assumption is correct , and if the gravitational energy all goes to the x - ray radiation , the p0p9 parameters should satisfy a scaling as @xmath137 . to see this , in figure [ fig : standard_disk ]",
    "we plot @xmath138 against @xmath24 .",
    "since the expected relation is thus confirmed , we conclude that the disk can be considered standard .      while the change of the bb and mcd parameters were understood , that of the coronal geometry is yet to be revealed .",
    "this can be addressed via the optical depth which represents the amount of the corona along the line of sight .",
    "if the coronal geometry were constant across the transition , we would expect @xmath139 .",
    "however , as seen in figure [ fig : parameters_plots ] ( c ) and [ fig : parameters_plots ] ( g ) , @xmath28 remained relatively constant from p0 to p7 .",
    "this can be explained , at lest qualitatively , by the decrease in @xmath24 , which made the path length shorter and compensated for the @xmath140 increase .",
    "furthermore , in p8 and p9 , @xmath28 increases much more sharply than would be expected by the increase of @xmath140 .",
    "this may be attributed to two alternative possibilities .",
    "one is the decrease in the coronal scale height , as already suggested by @xcite .",
    "the other is a decrease in the radial flow velocity @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the distance from the ns center . in either case , the coronal electron density @xmath143 , averaged over the coronal cross section , will increase , thus making @xmath28 higher .",
    "after @xcite , let us quantitatively examine , in several steps , the above two alternatives to explain the final increase in @xmath28 .",
    "first , in terms of the free - fall velocity @xmath144 , we can write as @xmath145 , where @xmath146  @xmath147 is the ns mass , @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) is a numerical factor which is assumed to be a constant over the coronal volume ( but can vary through the transition ) .",
    "next , @xmath28 can be expressed as    @xmath150    where @xmath151 is the thomson scattering cross section , and the integration is made along our line of sight .",
    "third , @xmath141 and @xmath152 can be incorporated together into the mass accretion rate @xmath140 as    @xmath153    where @xmath154 is the coronal cross section at @xmath142 , @xmath155 is the average molecular weight and @xmath156 is the proton mass . in addition , we may assume , for simplicity , that @xmath154 is approximated as @xmath157 , where @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) is a form factor . then , as long as @xmath158 is rather close to unity , the integration in equation ( [ eq : tau1 ] ) can be approximated by radial integration from @xmath160 to @xmath24 . finally ,",
    "performing this integration , and eliminating @xmath140 through the relation @xmath161 , we obtain    @xmath162    equating equation ( [ eq : tau2 ] ) with the observed @xmath28 , and substituting the observed values of @xmath24 and @xmath44 , we have deduced the behavior of @xmath163 as shown in figure [ fig : g_zeta ] .",
    "thus , the factor @xmath163 over p0p7 has been obtained as @xmath164 , in agreement with the value of @xmath165 ( assuming @xmath166 ) derived by @xcite in the hard state .",
    "furthermore , it steeply decreases to @xmath167 at p8 and p9 .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)g_zeta.eps    in this way , the observed increase in @xmath28 towards the final stage of the transition can be explained by a decrease in either @xmath158 , or @xmath148 , or both .",
    "the former means the flattening of the corona as already discussed , while the latter means a decrease of the radial flow velocity . in any case , an important consequence is the requirement for @xmath168 ( assuming @xmath158 is not too small ) , as pointed out by @xcite ; that is , the radial flow velocity of the corona is much lower than the free - fall velocity , and hence the corona is still in a nearly keplerian motion ( particularly at later phases of the transition ) with the azimuthal velocity component dominating over @xmath169 .",
    "we implicitly assumed so far that the density of the corona , by definition , is low enough not to emit photons by itself . in order to confirm this ,",
    "the bremsstrahlung emissivity of the corona was estimated from the electron density in equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) and utilizing @xmath170 .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emissivity , calculated as @xmath171 , then becomes @xmath172  @xmath173 over p0p9 .",
    "this corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath174  erg s@xmath3 @xcite , which is negligible compared with @xmath175  erg s@xmath3 .",
    "thus , our scenario is self consistent .      in figure",
    "[ fig : parameters_plots ] ( d ) , we find @xmath176 throughout . although the consistency of the @xmath177 ratio is consistent with the prediction by the virial theorem applied to the disk and the corona in a keplerian motion , the absolute value of @xmath178 is lower than the expected value of 0.5 . an obvious cause of this discrepancy is in the system inclination ; it may be lower than the assumed value of 45@xmath179 .",
    "another interesting possibility is soft landing of the accreting gas onto the ns surface .",
    "the ns in this system is considered to be spinning with the frequency @xmath180  hz @xcite .",
    "thus , assuming that the accreting gas is rotating with the keplerian velocity @xmath181 at @xmath160 ( as evidenced by the low value of @xmath148 ) , the bb luminosity would be reduced by a factor of @xmath182 . yet",
    "another possibility is azimuthal bulk comptonization of the bb photons by the high circular velocity of the corona ( section [ sec : corona ] ) ; this will take up a fraction of the keplerian energy ( up to @xmath183 ) that should have been radiated as @xmath39 .",
    "considering these multiple effects , the result in figure [ fig : parameters_plots ] ( d ) may be brought into a better agreement with the virial theorem .",
    "in addition to the above two possibilities , yet another obvious explanation to the 20% deficit of @xmath39 is to assume that a fraction of matter is launched as outflows instead of accreting onto the ns surface ( e.g. , @xcite ) . according to @xcite",
    ", 4u1608 - 52 indeed showed a sign of such outflows when its total luminosity was @xmath184  erg s@xmath3 .",
    "however , in contrast to the case of 4u 1608 - 52 wherein the @xmath185 ratio decreased meanwhile from @xmath186 to @xmath187 , the ratio in aql x-1 remained relatively constant at @xmath178 as the luminosity increases during the transition .",
    "we hence consider that outflows would not provide a major source of the @xmath39 deficit in the present case",
    ".      based on continuous monitoring of lmxbs with maxi and swift , @xcite showed that the state transitions in lmxbs occur in two types ; one type of events , involved in `` normal outbursts '' , take place on a typical time scale of a day or less , while those of the other type , seen in `` mini - outbursts '' with much smaller flux changes , proceed on a longer time scales of a few days . as seen in the maxi light curve ( figure 3 of @xcite ) , the present transition is clearly associated with a normal outburst in their classification , and the transition time scale we observed , about 30 ks , or @xmath188  hours , is consistent with those seen in that type of transitions .",
    "compared with these episodes in lmxb , the soft vs. hard state transitions in black - hole binaries have been observed to take place on considerably longer time scales , several days to 10 days ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a simple explanation of this difference would be that the radial propagation of changes in the accretion - disk conditions ( typically on viscous time scales ) takes longer in stellar black holes due to the larger disk size reflecting the mass difference .",
    "alternatively , the difference may be attributed to the stronger compton cooling of a corona in an lmxb , by the bb photons which are absent in black holes .",
    "further investigation into this issue is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we analyzed an archival data of aql x-1 taken with suzaku on 2011 october 21 for a gross duration of 80 ks .",
    "the source underwent a transition from the hard state to the soft state , on a time scale of @xmath189  ks .",
    "we have successfully explained the spectral evolution by combining the disk blackbody emission with thermal comptonization of the blackbody photons from the ns surface .",
    "the model parameters changed continuously , which justifies the spectral decomposition , and unifies the interpretations of the soft and the hard state .",
    "utilizing the obtained parameters , particularly @xmath28 , the comptonizing corona is suggested to shrink radially as the source approaches the soft state . in addition , the transition is likely to involve a vertical flattening of the corona , or a decrease in the radial flow velocity in the corona , or both .",
