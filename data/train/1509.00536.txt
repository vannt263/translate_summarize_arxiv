    "quantized control problems have been an active research topic in the past two decades .",
    "discrete - level actuators / sensors and digital communication channels are typical in practical control systems , and they yield quantized signals in feedback loops .",
    "quantization errors lead to poor system performance and even loss of stability .",
    "therefore , various control techniques to explicitly take quantization into account have been proposed , as surveyed in @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "switched system models are widely used as a mathematical framework to represent both continuous and discrete dynamics . for example , such models are applied to dc - dc converters @xcite and to car engines @xcite .",
    "stability and stabilization of switched systems have also been extensively studied ; see , e.g. , the survey @xcite , the book @xcite , and many references therein .    in view of the practical importance of both research areas and common technical tools to study them , the extension of quantized control to switched systems",
    "has recently received increasing attention .",
    "there is by now a stream of papers on control with limited information for discrete - time markovian jump systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , our previous work @xcite has analyzed the stability of sampled - data switched systems with static quantizers .    in this paper , we study the stabilization of continuous - time switched linear systems with quantized output feedback .",
    "our objective is to solve the following problem : given a switched system and a controller , design a quantizer to achieve asymptotic stability of the closed - loop system .",
    "we assume that the information of the currently active plant mode is available to the controller and the quantizer . extending the quantizer in @xcite for the non - switched case to the switched case",
    ", we propose a lyapunov - based update rule of the quantizer under a slow - switching assumption of average dwell - time type @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of quantized control for switched systems is that a mode switch changes the state trajectories and saturates the quantizer . in the non - switched case @xcite , in order to avoid quantizer saturation , the quantizer is updated so that the state trajectories always belong to certain invariant regions defined by level sets of a lyapunov function .",
    "however , for switched systems , these invariant regions are dependent on the modes .",
    "hence the state may not belong to such regions after a switch . to keep the state in the invariant regions",
    ", we here adjust the quantizer at every switching time , which prevent quantizer saturation .",
    "the same philosophy of emphasizing the importance of quantizer updates after switching has been proposed in @xcite for sampled - data switched systems with quantized state feedback .",
    "subsequently , related works were presented for the output feedback case @xcite and for the case with bounded disturbances @xcite .",
    "the crucial difference lies in the fact that these works use the quantizer based on @xcite and investigates propagation of reachable sets for capturing the measurement .",
    "this approach also aims to avoid quantizer saturation , but it is fundamentally disparate from our lyapunov - based approach .    this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the main result , theorem [ thm : stability_theorem ] , after explaining the components of the closed - loop system .",
    "section iii gives the update rule of the quantizer and is devoted to the proof of the convergence of the state to the origin . in section iv , we discuss lyapunov stability",
