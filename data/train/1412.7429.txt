    "non - normal nonlinear evolutionary equations are of great interest not only in their own right but also in application areas , in particular , in fluid dynamics  @xcite , where the combination of non - normality and non - linearity give rise respectively to ( i ) transient growth and ( ii ) coherent states and global modes , and are thereby evoked as a subcritical route to turbulence .",
    "the focus of the present work is on the study of such equations in their own right , although potential applications in optics and fluid dynamics are highlighted .",
    "the present work is first of all placed in the context of the existing literature concerning transient growth , coherent states , and global modes .",
    "[ [ transient - growth - in - linear - systems ] ] transient growth in linear systems : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    historically , the linear stability of a system of evolutionary equations was tackled via eigenvalue analysis .",
    "consider a generic evolutionary system @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a trajectory in @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a real parameter .",
    "a _ base state _ @xmath4 of the system is a solution of the equation @xmath5 .",
    "the _ linearization _ around the base state refers to the following equation : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the jacobian matrix , with @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 , and let @xmath10 denote the eigenvalue with largest real part .",
    "the full system is said to be linearly stable if @xmath11 .",
    "suppose for a critical parameter value @xmath12 we have @xmath11 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "then the system undergoes a bifurcation from linearly stable to linearly unstable at the critical value @xmath12 .",
    "the same analysis can usually be applied to spatially extended systems by projecting the evolutionary equation on to a set of basis functions of dimension @xmath16 and taking @xmath17 , assuming that the weak solutions so constructed tend to a strong solution .",
    "such systems can exhibit transient growth in a subcritical parameter regime whereby for suitable initial conditions involving a superposition of eigenmodes , the @xmath18 norm ( or some other more appropriate measure of the energy ) of the solution grows initially before eventually decaying at a rate dictated by @xmath10 .",
    "this can happen in two ways .",
    "if the eigenvectors do not form a complete set spanning @xmath2 , then the solution to the initial - value problem will involve contributions such as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , such that transient algebraic growth is possible before the onset of the asymptotic decay of the solution .",
    "we do not consider this case further here ( but see reference  @xcite ) .",
    "instead , we consider situations where the eigenvectors of @xmath7 do indeed span @xmath2 but are non - orthogonal , corresponding to a situation where @xmath7 is not a normal operator .",
    "in such a scenario , the @xmath18 norm of solutions involving certain combinations of eigenvectors can grow transiently before eventually decaying , with transient growth factors @xmath22 that can be as high as @xmath23 ( e.g. reference  @xcite ) .",
    "this is the phenomenon of transient growth .",
    "starting in the 1990s , transient growth has been identified in fluid dynamics where the base state is a parallel flow and the linearized equations describe the dynamics of the perturbed velocity and pressure fields  @xcite . it is mooted as a mechanism for the subcritical transition to turbulence  @xcite and as a route to three - dimensional waves in two - phase parallel flow  @xcite . however , it is not always observed in direct numerical simulation based on the full nonlinear equations ( even when the linearized equations of motion predicts that it should play a role )  @xcite , and its importance as a potential mechanism for the subcritical transition to instability ( hence turbulence ) is debated : in the work by waleffe  @xcite the importance of coherent states ( i.e. a self - sustained spatial structure ; see below ) is emphasized in the subcritical transition to instability , while the putative role of transient growth is minimized .",
    "a synthesis arising from this debate is presented in references  @xcite , in which a scenario is presented whereby the transient growth provides the initial energy needed for a small - amplitude disturbance to grow subcritically and become self - sustained via the excitation of a coherent state .",
    "indeed , transient growth has been experimentally observed in at least one context ( the optical one ) , in the propagation of light in unidirectional wave guides  @xcite .",
    "since the generic properties of the evolutionary equations are similar in both fluids and optics , a suggestion here is to use transient growth on the side of experimental optics ( where extremely precise experiments with materials with almost arbitrary optical properties ) to illuminate transient growth on the fluids side .",
    "_ applications of the linearized complex ginzburg  landau equation : _ we review briefly the applications of the complex ginzburg  landau equation , focusing in particular on the linearized version , although the extension to nonlinear versions is immediate .",
    "the application of the cgl equation to optical waveguides is immediate ( reference  @xcite and appendix  [ app : paraxial ] ) and needs no further discussion .",
    "we therefore also describe briefly the role of the cgl equation in fluid dynamics . as in the above , for linear stability analysis of parallel flows , one solves the linearized equations of motion transformed into the frequency domain and thereby reduced to eigenvalue form ( e.g. orr  sommerfeld or orr  sommerfeld  squire equations ) . in a similar manner",
    ", one may solve for the response of the base state to an impulsive disturbance , localized both in space and time . if the disturbance grows in time but is convected downstream by the base - state parallel flow , the system is said to be convectively unstable . on the other hand ,",
    "if the disturbance grows in time at the location of the initial impulsive disturbance , then the flow is said to be absolutely unstable  @xcite .",
    "the growth rates obtained from eigenvalue analysis of the linearized navier ",
    "stokes equations are merely asymptotic ( i.e. valid in the limit as @xmath24 ) .",
    "this is true for both parallel flows and global stability analyses . in the parallel flow case , for both the orr  sommerfeld and orr  sommerfeld  squire equations",
    ", effects not captured by a simple eigenvalue analysis can be present at early times and lead to substantial transient growth because these equations are non - normal .",
    "in addition , there are very few closed - form solutions to the orr  sommerfeld and orr  sommerfeld  squire equations .",
    "thus , the complex ginzburg  landau ( cgl ) equation is introduced instead as a minimal model of absolute instability , transient growth , and global instability in parallel flows . although different from the physical linearized fluid equations ( e.g. orr  sommerfeld or orr  sommerfeld  squire ) equations , this model is sufficiently complex that it still retains the same important qualitative behaviours as the former .",
    "the model equation for the homogeneous case is @xmath25 here @xmath26 represents some instability in the fluid that is convected downstream by a constant velocity @xmath27 .",
    "the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath3 are real , while @xmath28 is the complex - valued diffusion coefficient , with @xmath29 .",
    "equation   is amenable to a modal analysis , wherein a normal - mode solution @xmath30 is possible , provided the following dispersion relation is satisfied : @xmath31 in this context , a complex diffusion coefficient with positive imaginary part is necessary to give a growth rate @xmath32 that is negative for short wavenumbers , leading to a well - posed problem .",
    "this is a minimal model of linear instability , and it includes longwave growth and shortwave stabilization . clearly , the flow is unstable if @xmath33 , where instability exists for a band of wavenumbers with @xmath34 .",
    "more importantly , we have a minimal model of absolute instability  @xcite : the model is said to be absolutely unstable if ( i ) it is unstable , with @xmath33 ; ( ii ) the green s function @xmath35 blows up at @xmath36 and as @xmath24 .",
    "if condition ( i ) is satisfied but not ( ii ) , the flow is said to be convectively unstable . in more detail ,",
    "the green s function solves @xmath37 by direct computation we have    @xmath38\\bigg\\},\\qquad { \\gamma_{\\mathrm{r}}}>0 .",
    "\\label{eq : greens_cgl}\\ ] ]    the flow is absolutely unstable if @xmath39 , i.e. if @xmath40 .",
    "however , this condition can be recast as follows : @xmath41[eq : greens_cgl_all ]    i.e. @xmath42 is the ( complex ) saddle point of the dispersion relation  .",
    "the derivation of equations   involves the computation of a gaussian integral over all wavenumbers .",
    "here lies the wide applicability of cgl theory : a wide class of dispersion relations in fluid mechanics is locally quadratic in wavenumber , enabling a saddle - point approximation of the generic green s function , such that all green s functions in this class resemble equation   in the limit as @xmath24 .",
    "thus , for this wide class of fluid - mechanical dispersion relations , the condition for absolute instability is simply that the imaginary part of the frequency at the saddle point be positive  @xcite .",
    "of course , there is a variety of fluid - mechanical problems where naive application of the saddle - point criterion   fails  @xcite .",
    "however , the saddle - point criterion   supplemented with the requirement that the spatial branches emanating from the saddle point should extend into opposite half - planes in the complex @xmath43-plane , is sufficient to guarantee absolute instability  @xcite .",
    "[ [ coherent - states ] ] coherent states : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a coherent state refers to a self - sustained nonlinear disturbance . in work on parallel flow instability",
    ", the coherent state typically takes the form of a stationary state or a travelling wave ( e.g. references  @xcite ) .",
    "however , so - called nonlinear global modes in open shear flows can be classified in the same way , since such global modes comprise a coherent disturbance localized in space ( but often involving propagating fronts ) and oscillating in time , sustained by nonlinear absolute instability ( e.g. reference  @xcite ) .",
    "a main aim in this and related works is to understand the nonlinear response of parallel - flow systems to impulsive localized forcing , moving beyond the linear theory of absolute and convective instability .",
    "the nonlinear ( homogeneous ) complex ginzburg  landau equation ( cgl ) is introduced in these papers as a ` toy model ' whose solution gives insight into the far more complicated ( but analogous ) fluid - mechanical systems  @xcite .",
    "[ [ the - inhomogeneous - complex - ginzburglandau - equation - linear - and - nonlinear ] ] the inhomogeneous complex ginzburg  landau equation ( linear and nonlinear ) : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the focus of the present work is in the inhomogeneous complex ginzburg  landau ( cgl ) equation with quadratic inhomogeneity .",
    "the linearized equation is solved exactly in reference  @xcite ( but see also reference  @xcite ) , and the resulting solutions have been used to demonstrate the phenomenon of transient growth  @xcite . there , a connection is made with the phenomenon of linear absolute instability in the homogeneous case and linear ( ` global ' ) instability in the inhomogeneous case : linear absolute instability is necessary but not sufficient for the onset of linear global instability .",
    "the nonlinear inhomogeneous case has been solved asymptotically by pier and co - workers ( references  @xcite ; for a review , see reference  @xcite ) in the limit where the spatial scale of the inhomogeneity varies slowly , such that wkb theory applies .",
    "two kinds of self - sustained oscillation appear , namely _ soft global modes _ and _ steep global modes_. the soft modes obtain their frequency from wholly nonlinear considerations , and are so called because the nonlinear upstream spatial wavenumber of the global mode switches smoothly to the nonlinear downstream spatial wavenumber across a region of local absolute instability .",
    "in contrast , the frequency selected by the steep modes is obtained from linear theory , and the upstream and downstream spatial wavenumbers of the global mode connect in a non - smooth fashion .",
    "again , the two kinds of nonlinear global mode retain a ghostly residuum of the linear theory : a necessary condition for the existence of a soft or steep global mode is the presence of a region of local linear absolute instability .",
    "also , steep global modes appear as soon as there exists a point of local linear absolute instability , even though the system is still linearly globally stable .    in the present work ,",
    "the focus is moved to the study of the inhomogeneous cgl equation with inhomogeneities that vary on arbitrary spatial scales .",
    "a small - amplitude perturbation theory is presented corresponding to the situation close to criticality .",
    "the perturbation theory is based on the regular perturbation theory of quantum mechanics  @xcite , but the results are similar to a previous work based on stuart  landau theory  @xcite .",
    "the main innovation therefore is to use the perturbative results as a stepping stone to a full analysis using a numerical approach that is valid for arbitrary amplitudes and arbitrary departures from criticality , supplemented by direct numerical simulation to determine whether the global modes are realised in the transient evolution of the model system .",

    "the evolution of the @xmath18 norm @xmath75 is again unchanged under the addition of the nonlinear term : the quantity @xmath75 still evolves according to the norm - evolution first written down for the linear problem ( i.e. equation  ) . however , in contrast to the linear model , equation   has a nonlinear periodic solution , which we find by making the trial solution @xmath76 substitution of equation   into equation   yields the following eigenvalue problem for @xmath77 : @xmath78 in general , equation   has a family of solutions labelled by the continuous parameter @xmath79 , with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath80 .",

    "this is a subcritical transition to ( nonlinear ) instability .",
    "these results point to the following conclusion : linear transient growth by itself is not sufficient to induce a transition from a regime of small - amplitude disturbances to one of nonlinear instability in the model equation  .",

    "based on equation  , there are four cases to consider , depending on the respective signs of @xmath275 and @xmath276 . only those cases for which equation   admits a positive fixed point can be addressed sensibly within the framework of stuart  landau theory , since the existence of such a fixed point is precisely the condition needed to support a global mode .",
    "the parameter values that produce a fixed point are the following :    * * subcritical bifurcation * , corresponding to @xmath212 and @xmath257 .",

    "even if the validity of these expansions is curtailed by a small radius of convergence , this result is indicative of a mechanism whereby increasing the magnitude of the nonlinearity can lead to an increase in the number of global modes ( whether stable or unstable ) supported by the system . beyond the radius of convergence of the perturbation theory , the existence of multiple global modes can be established via numerical calculations .",
    "this topic is addressed in section  [ sec : cgl_numerical ] .    in the present analytical framework , it is possible to demonstrate - albeit heuristically - that the nonlinear cgl equation with focussing nonlinearity ( i.e. @xmath214 , @xmath209 ) admits only a finite number of global modes .",

    "thus , we solve equation   in the limit @xmath164 , with @xmath106 .",
    "the dominant balance in equation   is then between the nonlinear term and the ` kinetic ' term @xmath286 . for @xmath214 ,",

    "we have carried out direct numerical simulations of equation   using the same method as before , and with the initial condition given by equation  ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : dns_u1 ] .    a spacetime plot in figure  [ fig : dns_u1](a ) shows the selection of a persistent spatial structure , confirmed in figure  [ fig : dns_u1](b ) .",
    "the frequency of oscillation coincides with that of the neutrally stable global mode ( figure  [ fig : dns_u1](c ) ) .",
    "compared to the case with @xmath308 , the presence of advection has stabilized the large - amplitude global mode and eliminated the chaos from the system .",
    "in this subsection we take @xmath367 , @xmath360 , and the parameters @xmath200 and @xmath368 both real and positive .",
    "based on equation  , the neutral curve for the onset of instability in the linear global mode becomes @xmath369 and we work in a subcritical regime with @xmath370 . the numerical iterative method outlined at the start of this section is applied to compute the nonlinear global modes .",
    "these nonlinear global modes emerge when @xmath371 for at least one @xmath79-value .",
    "the emergence of the nonlinear global modes occurs precisely when the correction @xmath372 changes sign ( section  [ sec : global_modes ] , in particular equation  ) , corresponding to a subcritical hopf bifurcation  @xcite .",
    "the critical parameter value @xmath373 such that @xmath374 is plotted in figure  [ fig : neutral ] , with @xmath375 , indicating the subcritical appearance of the nonlinear global modes in the parameter space .",
    "parameter space . here , ` lgm ' means linear global mode ( the region above this curve corresponds to linear global instability ) , ` ngm ' means nonlinear global mode , ` l - au ' means linearly absolutely unstable , and ` l - cu ' means linearly convectively unstable .",
    "the inset shows the difference @xmath376 as a function of @xmath368 , which vanishes at the point where the nonlinear global mode emerges for the first time , corresponding to a subcritical hopf bifurcation.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the difference @xmath376 as a function of @xmath368 for the onset of the first nonlinear global mode is shown in the inset to figure  [ fig : neutral ] .",
    "the difference between the two critical values increases as @xmath368 increases .",
    "this corresponds to a path in parameter space that starts in the neighbourhood of the point where @xmath377 ( i.e. where the perturbative techniques introduced in section  [ sec : global_modes ] apply ) ; the path then tends towards a region of parameter space far removed from criticality wherein the amplitude of the nonlinear global mode is finite . however , in the main part of the figure , the two critical curves ` shadow ' one another , meaning that the nonlinear global mode is influenced by the corresponding linearized dynamics .",
    "in contrast to the asymptotic global modes studied by pier and co - workers  @xcite , the onset of linear absolute instability is necessary but insufficient for the onset of nonlinear global modes : one must also be ` close ' to the neutral curve of the corresponding linear global mode .",
    "also , the necessary condition previously derived for the onset of nonlinear global modes and linear transient growth ( equation  ) is not a sufficient condition for the onset of nonlinear global modes : again , one must also be ` close ' to the neutral curve of the corresponding linear global mode to observe the subcritical nonlinear global mode .",
    "summarizing , we have introduced a new two - level model admitting nonnormality and nonlinearity and highlighting the way in which subcritical transient growth can trigger an unstable global mode , which then leads to unbounded growth  a rather counterintuitive result in a system that is linearly stable with respect to eigenvalue analysis .",
    "we have argued that this model can be imported directly into an optical experiment , and the hope would be to such experiments realised as a vivid illustration of the transient - growth mechanism .    complementing the developments in the two - level system , we have investigated the nonlinear inhomogeneous complex ginzburg",
    " landau equation as a spatially - extended analogue of the simple two - level system , and have demonstrated using non - perturbative methods the existence of multiple global modes in such systems .",
    "theory shows that for the subcritical case , the global mode of smaller amplitude is always unstable , while the numerics show that the global mode of larger amplitude can either be stable or unstable , with the instability controlled in particular by the advection .",
    "the large - amplitude unstable global mode however demonstrates a kind of ` one - sided ' instability whereby trajectories in an abstract phase space make periodic excursions away from the global mode but return close to the global mode , thereby giving rise to a chaotic dynamics .",
    "l n would like to acknowledge relevant discussions with many helpful experts , in particular m. pietrzyk , p. d. m. spelt , darryl holm , and b. pier .",
    "this material is based upon works supported by the european research council ( erc ) under the research project erc-2011-adg 290562-multiwave .",
    "in optics , laser beams tend to be well collimated , such that their propagation is almost unidirectional .",
    "the derivation of a model suitable for this system is described briefly . in free space , and for an electric field oscillating at a single frequency ,",
    "maxwell s equations for a scalar electric field reduce to helmholtz s equation , @xmath378 , where @xmath379 , @xmath380 is the wave frequency , and @xmath381 is the speed of light in a vacuum . here",
    ", information about the polarization of the light is not considered .",
    "the green s function ( outgoing waves ) for the helmoholtz equation in three dimensions is @xmath382 .",
    "using this green s function and kirchoff s integral formula , the light received at a field point @xmath383 from an aperture of surface area @xmath384 is @xmath385{\\mathrm{d}}s({\\bm{x}}_0 ) , \\label{eq : kirchoff_huygens}\\ ] ] where @xmath386 , and where @xmath387 is the outward - pointing unit normal of the surface @xmath384 . also , @xmath388 is the relative separation between the field point @xmath383 and the source point @xmath389 .",
    "it is assumed that light propagating from the aperture behaves more or less like an outward - moving wave front , such that @xmath390 on @xmath384 .",
    "then , equation   simplifies : @xmath391\\frac{{\\mathrm{e}}^{{\\mathrm{i}}kr}}{r}e({\\bm{x}}_0)\\,{\\mathrm{d}}s({\\bm{x}}_0 ) .",
    "\\label{eq : kirchoff_huygens1}\\ ] ] moreover , the far - field assumption @xmath392 is made , such that equation   becomes @xmath393 where @xmath394 is the angle between the normal vector @xmath387 and the vector @xmath395 .",
    "now , the paraxial approximation is invoked , namely that the beam is well collimated far from the source , such that @xmath396 is important only close to the optical axis ( here chosen arbitrarily to be the @xmath149-axis ) .",
    "thus , we take @xmath397 .",
    "hence , @xmath398 , and the aperture @xmath384 resembles a planar surface with outward - pointing unit normal @xmath399 .",
    "equation   then reads @xmath400 finally , the relative distance @xmath92 is approximated as @xmath401/(z - z_0)$ ] and the integral @xmath384 is taken over @xmath402 ( with the extra condition that @xmath403 is supported only on @xmath384 ) .",
    "one obtains        can be viewed as a green s function that propagates the light from the source point @xmath406 to a field point at @xmath149 , in the paraxial approximation . moreover",
    ", the green s function satisfies the paraxial wave equation @xmath407 thus , @xmath408-fields that satisfy the paraxial condition also solve equation  . for such fields",
    ", one writes @xmath409 , such that @xmath410 by inspection of equation  , it is clear that the solution @xmath411 to equation   is propagated from @xmath406 to @xmath149 as follows : @xmath412 where @xmath413,\\qquad z\\neq z_0.\\ ] ]    in two dimensions with coordinates @xmath414 , similar arguments hold : the green s function for the full helmholtz equation is @xmath415 , where @xmath416 is the hankel function of the first kind , and where @xmath417 . following the same procedures as before , the paraxial wave equation   is recovered , and the green s function @xmath418 is obtained , such that @xmath419 is obtained from the same field at @xmath406 by convolution , @xmath420    in optical media , the propagation constant @xmath421 is no longer real or constant .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "first , we note that @xmath422 , where @xmath126 is the speed of light in the medium , and @xmath423 is the ( complex ) index of refraction , @xmath424 .",
    "thus , @xmath425 , and the right - propagating electric field contains a factor @xmath426 .",
    "thus , @xmath427 corresponds to absorption , whereby the beam s energy is absorbed by the medium . in a gaussian duct , both the index of refraction @xmath16 and the absorption coefficient @xmath428 vary in the direction perpendicular to propagation .",
    "we consider the situation wherein @xmath429 and where @xmath430 , meaning that the index of refraction is maximal at the duct centreline @xmath431 . in this scenario ,",
    "optical rays will be trapped near the duct centreline  @xcite . in the opposite scenario ( @xmath432 ) ,",
    "the variation of the index of refraction will cause incident rays to diverge from the duct centreline . also , we consider @xmath433 , where @xmath434 .",
    "thus , @xmath435 we also write this as @xmath436 , with @xmath437 and we work in the limit where @xmath438 , such that @xmath439 .",
    "thus , the paraxial wave equation   becomes @xmath440 where we work with two - dimensional beams .",
