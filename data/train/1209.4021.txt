    "soon after the release of observations of the nasa wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature and polarization anisotropies , some anomalies in cmb field have also been reported @xcite . among these , an extremely cold spot ( cs ) centered at galactic coordinate ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) and a characteristic scale about @xmath5 was detected in the spherical mexican hat wavelet ( smhw ) non - gaussian analysis @xcite . comparing with the distribution derived from the isotropic and gaussian cmb simulations , due to this cs , the smhw coefficients of wmap data have an excess of kurtosis @xcite .",
    "the non - gaussian cs has also been confirmed by using some other statistics @xcite . at the same time",
    ", some analyses on wmap cs have also been done , such as the non - gaussian tests for the different detectors and different frequency channels of wmap satellite @xcite , the investigation of the nvss sources @xcite , the survey around the cs with megacam on the canada - france - hawaii telescope @xcite , the redshift survey using vimos on vlt towards cs @xcite , and the cross - correlation between wmap and faraday depth rotation map @xcite .    since then , various alternative explanations for this cs have been proposed , including the possible foregrounds @xcite , sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite , the supervoid in the universe @xcite , and the cosmic texture @xcite . due to the fact that , nearly all the explanations of cs are related to the local characters of the cmb field , the studies on the local properties of cs are necessary . in the previous work @xcite , we have studied the local non - gaussian properties of wmap cs by the local mean temperature , variance , skewness and kurtosis .",
    "we found the excesses of the local variance and skewness in the large scales with @xmath6 , which implies that wmap cs is a large - scale non - gaussian structure , rather than a combination of some small structures . in this paper , we shall focus on the same topic by using the different local statistics .",
    "we introduce the local minkowski functions ( mfs ) , and apply them to the wmap data , in particular wmap cs . comparing with random gaussian simulation , we find that for the statistics based on mf @xmath2 , wmap cs significantly deviates from gaussianity at large scale , especially at the scale @xmath7 .",
    "meanwhile , similar to @xcite , we find that these local non - gaussianities of wmap cs can be excellently explained by a cosmic texture . if subtracting this texture from wmap data , we find that all these anomilies of mfs disappear .",
    "so our local analysis of the cs in this paper also strongly supports the cosmic texture explanation .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the wmap data , which will be used in the analysis . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we define the local mfs and apply them into wmap data . in section [ sec4 ] , we summarize the main results of this paper .",
    "in our analysis , we shall use the wmap data including the ilc7 map and the nilc5 map .",
    "the wmap instrument is composed of 10 das spanning five frequencies from 23 to 94 ghz @xcite .",
    "the internal linear combination ( ilc ) method has been used by wmap team to generate the ilc maps @xcite .",
    "the 7-year ilc ( written as  ilc7 \" ) map is a weighted combination from all five original frequency bands , which are smoothed to a common resolution of one degree . for the 5-year wmap data , in @xcite",
    "the authors have made a higher resolution cmb ilc map ( written as  nilc5 \" ) , an implementation of a constrained linear combination of the channels with minimum error variance on a frame of spherical called needlets @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will consider both these two maps for the analysis .",
    "note that these wmap data have the same resolution parameter @xmath8 , and the corresponding total pixel number @xmath9 .    in comparison with wmap observations to give constraint on the statistics ,",
    "a @xmath10 cosmology is assumed with the cosmological parameters given by the wmap 7-year best - fit values @xcite : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 at @xmath17 . similar to the previous work @xcite , to simulate the ilc7 map , we ignore the noises and smooth the simulated map with one degree resolution . and for nilc5 , we consider the noise level and beam window function given in @xcite . in all the random gaussian simulations ,",
    "we assume that the temperature fluctuations and instrument noise follow the gaussian distribution , and do not consider any effect due to the residual foreground contaminations .",
    "mfs characterize the morphological properties of convex , compact sets in an @xmath18-dimensional space . on the 2-dimensional spherical surface @xmath19",
    ", any morphological property can be expanded as a linear combination of three mfs , which represent the area , circumference and integrated geodesic curvature of an excursion set @xcite . for a given threshold @xmath20 ,",
    "it is convenient to define the excursion set @xmath21 and its boundary @xmath22 of a smooth scalar field @xmath23 as follows : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "then , the mfs @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be written as @xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the surface element of @xmath32 and the line element along @xmath33 , respectively . and @xmath34 is the geodesic curvature .",
    "given a pixelated map with field @xmath35 , these mfs can be numerically calculated by the formulae @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 note that @xmath38 denotes the covariant differentiation of @xmath23 with respect to the coordinate @xmath39 . the delta function in these formulae can be numerically approximated through a discretization of threshold space in bins of width @xmath40 by the stepfunction @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "the expectation values of three mfs for a gaussian random field are also derived in @xcite , which have been explicitly expressed in equations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) in @xcite .",
    "these mfs have been applied by cosmologists to look for derivations from gaussianity of the perturbations in the cmb @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite the authors used the mfs to probe the cold / hot disk - like structure in the cmb .",
    "however , they found these statistics are noise - dominated for wmap cs . for a single wmap or planck resolution map , the method can only detect the highly prominent disk , i.e. extremely cold or hot disk with quite large area .",
    "these can be easily understood as follows : since the mfs are constructed on the global sky , the local non - gaussianity of the cold / hot spot in the relatively small scale has been diluted to be too small .      to study the local properties of wmap cs , similar to the previous works @xcite , in this paper we shall define the local mfs as the statistics of cmb field . for a given full - sky wmap data with @xmath8 ( ilc7 or nilc5 ) , we smooth them using a gaussian filter with a smoothing scale of @xmath42 . since mfs are sensitive to the smoothing scale of a density field and thereby we can obtain a variety of information from density fields by using different smoothing levels . in this paper , we focus on both ilc fields smoothed by six different smoothing scales @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "then , we can construct the corresponding full - sky maps : @xmath49 and @xmath50 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , where @xmath23 is the corresponding ilc temperature anisotropic map .",
    "now , we can define the local mfs .",
    "let @xmath51 be a spherical cap with aperture of @xmath52 degree , centered at @xmath53 .",
    "the local mfs @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) in this cap can be calculated by using eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , which are denoted as @xmath56 in the rest of this paper .",
    "but here the summation is carried out only for the pixels inside the cap @xmath51 .",
    "note that in our calculation , the binning range of threshold @xmath20 is set to be -3.0 to 3.0 with 24 equally spaced bins of @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the standard deviation of @xmath23-field in this cap ) per each mf . in order to quantify the same kind of mfs by a single quantity , following @xcite , for each @xmath39 ( the type of mfs ) , \\{@xmath59 , @xmath52 } ( the cap )",
    "we can define the @xmath60 as follows : @xmath61\\sigma_{\\alpha\\alpha'}^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\times [ v_i^{j}(\\nu_{\\alpha'};r)-v_i^{\\rm th}(\\nu_{\\alpha'};r ) ] , \\label{chi2 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the binning number of threshold values .",
    "@xmath64 is the theoretical value of @xmath56 , which is independent of the superscript @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath65 is the corresponding covariance matrix .",
    "although , in principle the theoretical values @xmath64 for the random gaussian field can be calculated by the analytical formulae @xcite , there are systematical differences from the numerical results due to the binning of threshold @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we avoid this problem by replacing the theoretical value @xmath64 by the quantity @xmath66 , which is the average value of all @xmath67 with @xmath68 . and the covariance matrix @xmath65 can also be numerically calculated by these quantities @xmath67 .",
    "note that the galactic plane have been excluded to reduce the effect of foreground residuals @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we denote this @xmath60 quantity as @xmath69 .",
    "clearly , the values @xmath69 obtained in this way for each cap can be viewed as a measure of non - gaussianity in the direction of the center of cap @xmath70 . for a given aperture @xmath52 , we scan the celestial sphere with evenly distributed spherical caps , and build the @xmath71- , @xmath72- , @xmath73-maps . in our analysis",
    ", we have chosen the locations of centroids of spots to be the pixels in @xmath74 resolution . by choosing different @xmath52 values",
    ", one can study the local properties of cmb field at different scales .",
    "same to the @xmath75-map ( or @xmath76- , @xmath77-maps ) defined in @xcite , here we also find that @xmath69 always maximize at the edge of the circles , rather than the center of circles . to overcome this problem and localize the non - gaussian sources , we define the average quantities @xmath78 where @xmath79 is again the pixel number in the @xmath80 cap .",
    "we apply the method to the ilc7 data by choosing @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath83 maps are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left panels ) , which clearly show that these local statistics , in particular third mf @xmath28 , are very sensitive to the foreground residuals and various point sources . the galactic plane is clearly presented , which is the non - gaussian area caused by the foreground residuals in ilc7 map .",
    "in addition , two important point sources at ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) and ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) , as well as several small ones , are also clearly found in the @xmath83 maps .",
    "so we expect these local statistics with small @xmath52 values can be used to identify the point sources and foreground residuals , which will be discussed in a separate paper . if we choose @xmath88 , from the middle panels in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we find the similar results , except for some non - gaussianities of small point sources , which have been diluted for this larger @xmath52 case . in the right panels , we have chosen @xmath89 , where the significant non - gaussianity around wmap cs are clearly presented in all three maps .",
