    "this significance level empirically matches our limiting sensitivity across the field and is adopted to remove a small number of sources with large and highly uncertain completeness and flux bias corrections ( i.e. , @xmath39% completeness ; see @xmath26[sec : simulations ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : area_vs_flux ] presents the sensitivity and sky coverage of the cdfs .",
    "twenty soft - band and 10 hard - band sources were rejected because they were below this flux threshold . in total , we used 724 sources detected in the soft band and 520 sources detected in the hard band to estimate the x - ray number counts , with sky coverages ranging from 0.232 deg@xmath40 to 0.004 deg@xmath40 depending on x - ray flux .",

    "to understand the effects of incompleteness and bias , we created 200 monte carlo simulated observations in both the soft and hard energy bands for each of the cdfs .",
    "we began by creating template background images for each field in the soft and hard bands following @xmath264.2 of a03 . to this end",
    ", we masked out all 829 known point - sources using circular apertures with radii twice those of the @xmath16  90% point spread function ( psf ) encircled - energy radii .",
    "we filled in the masked regions for each source with a local background estimated by making a poisson probability distribution of counts using an annulus with inner and outer radii of 2 and 4 times the @xmath1690% psf encircled - energy radius , respectively ( for further details see a03 ) .",
    "the resultant images include minimal contributions from detected point sources while still providing realistic contributions from extended sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which will cause a slight overestimation of the measured background close to extended sources .    to these template background images we added simulated sources at random positions .",
    "the fluxes of these simulated sources were drawn randomly from the total number - count models of m03 between @xmath41@xmath42  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 ( soft ) and @xmath43@xmath42  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 ( hard ) , respectively .",
    "these fluxes were converted to x - ray count rates assuming a @xmath36 power law and the maximum effective area of the cdfs . assuming a somewhat different average x - ray spectral slope ( @xmath442 ) does not dramatically change our results .",
    "we have not attempted to account for any scatter in the distribution of @xmath45 and note that individual sources with significantly steeper or flatter spectral slopes are likely to have much higher flux thresholds for detection due to the energy dependence of _ chandra _ s effective area .",
    "the number of cdf sources with deviant x - ray spectral slopes is small , and therefore are unlikely to have a large effect .",
    "exposure times for the simulated sources were derived from their positions on the cdf exposure maps ( see @xmath263.1 of a03 ) and used to convert count rates to counts . to include the effects of eddington bias ( i.e.",
    ", the measured flux is higher than the actual flux due to statistical fluctuations ) , the counts for a simulated source were then redrawn from a statistical error distribution .",
    "note that we kept track of the counts both before and after including eddington bias in order to decouple the effects of our photometry from those of eddington bias ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_bias_explain ] ) .",
    "finally , counts for each source were drawn randomly from a psf probability distribution function to simulate a real source and then added to the template image . to mimic the complex psf of the multi - observation cdfs",
    ", we adopted the combined model psf from the nearest real x - ray source in the cdfs .",
    "these model psfs were produced using the idl - based source extraction tool acis_extract ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereby the psf for each individual _ chandra _ observation was calculated with the ciao tool mkpsf using the caldb psf libraries , weighted by the number of counts in each exposure , and co - added .",
    "the nearest real source was always @xmath46 from the simulated source position .",
    "source searching and photometry of the simulated images were performed in a manner identical to that used to produce the cdf catalogs [ i.e. , using wavdetect @xcite and custom software ; see @xmath263.2 and @xmath263.4 of a03 for details ] .",
    "a completeness correction was determined by comparing the number of simulated input sources to the number of simulated detected sources as a function of detected counts .",
    "likewise , a flux recovery correction was estimated by comparing the simulated input counts ( both prior to and after including eddington bias ) to our measured aperture - corrected counts .",
    "since both completeness and flux recovery vary across the cdf fields due to _ chandra _ s changing psf and spatially dependent vignetting , we determined the completeness and flux recovery functions within a 2@xmath47 radius region around each real source , averaged over the 200 simulations .",
    "the radius value of 2@xmath47 was chosen as a compromise between the maximum area over which the psf remains relatively constant and the minimum area needed to achieve reasonable statistics with our 200 simulations .",
    "the above correction functions were used to correct the measured source densities and fluxes , respectively .",
    "the completeness and flux recovery functions remain close to unity above  counts .",
    "below this point , _ chandra _ s varying psf size and spatially dependent vignetting begin to affect source detection and photometry .",
    "figure  [ fig : bias_corrections ] demonstrates how the completeness and flux recovery functions behave for three separate positions in the field in both the soft and hard bands ; similar functions were obtained for the .",
    "incompleteness is due to three factors : a few percent decrease for moderately bright sources due to occasional source overlap ; a large decrease for faint sources near the detection threshold ; and a few percent increase for very faint sources due to source overlap or sources that lie in regions of particularly low background .",
    "the completeness curves shift as one moves off - axis because of the radially degrading sensitivity limit of the cdfs .",
    "likewise , deviations in the recovered flux correction are due to three factors : a few percent increase at all fluxes due to an additional aperture correction not originally accounted for in a03 ; a steady increase for faint sources due to photometry errors as detailed in figure  [ fig : flux_bias_explain ] ; and a steady decrease for faint sources due to eddington bias .",
    "eddington bias only appears to win out over photometry effects for soft - band sources near the centers of the fields .",
    "the cumulative flux distribution ( @xmath48-@xmath49 ) at each flux @xmath50 , for all sources brighter than @xmath50 weighted by the corresponding sky coverage , is @xmath51 where the sky coverage @xmath52 is the maximum solid angle over which each source could have been detected in both cdfs based on the 2@xmath38 limiting flux maps , and @xmath53 is the completeness correction interpolated from the position- and count - dependent simulated completeness correction ( see @xmath26[sec : simulations ] ) .",
    "additionally , each flux @xmath50 has been corrected for flux bias assuming @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the position- and count - dependent simulated flux recovery function ( see @xmath26[sec : simulations ] ) and @xmath56 is the original flux .",
    "figure  [ fig : num_cnts_agn_gal ] shows the total @xmath48-@xmath49 in the soft and hard bands for the combined sample .",
    "the combined @xmath48-@xmath49 curves are consistent with the distributions and models found by other authors ( e.g. , c02 ; m03 ) within the uncertainties .",
    "the cdfs appear to underestimate the soft - band number counts around @xmath57  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 compared to the model curve of m03 , although this is only a @xmath58 deviation .",
    "figure  [ fig : num_cnts_compare ] compares the number counts in the and .",
    "we have worked out error bars on the cumulative distributions following @xcite and calculated the deviation in quadrature at each data point in units of sigma .",
    "we find that the number counts from the two fields are consistent with each other at better than the @xmath30 confidence level over the entire soft band and above @xmath59  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 in the hard band .",
    "below this hard - band flux , statistical deviations gradually increase to @xmath60 at the faintest flux levels , a finding similar to that presented in c02 .",
    "this demonstrates that the field - to - field variations previously reported for the cdfs are entirely consistent with the lack of field - to - field variations found from champ @xcite , as the latter study only examined the x - ray @xmath61-@xmath49 for relatively bright sources where we find the cdfs are compatible .",
    "the total number counts in both bands have previously been best fitted with broken power laws with break fluxes between @xmath23@xmath24  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 ( e.g. , c02 ; m03 ) . given this break range and the limited statistics of the cdfs above @xmath62 erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2",
    ", we estimate the slope only for the faint end of the number counts below @xmath0 erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 . we have assumed a single power - law model of the form @xmath63 , where the slopes and normalizations were determined with a maximum - likelihood algorithm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at very faint x - ray flux levels , however ,",
    "the relation will begin to break down for certain source types due to the very different nature of their x - ray and optical k - corrections ( most notable in this regard are type  2 seyfert galaxies , whose x - ray - to - optical flux ratios can vary by more than an order of magnitude between @xmath2762 ; moran et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "there is also likely to be some degree of obscured and low - luminosity agn contamination at @xmath277 , as well as considerable potential galaxy contamination for @xmath278 and @xmath279  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 .",
    "we attribute the fact that star - forming galaxies begin to have @xmath278 at faint x - ray fluxes to ( 1 ) a stronger k - correction in the optical band than in the x - ray band that tends to shift potential star - forming galaxies into the agn region and ( 2 ) increasingly large uncertainties in the source band ratios ( the primary agn discriminator for low - luminosity x - ray sources ) at faint fluxes .",
    "we can estimate the prevalence of obscured agn among these ambiguous faint x - ray sources by stacking them in suitable subsets and examining their average x - ray band ratios . given the good correspondence between x - ray - to - optical flux ratio and agn activity , we stacked all of the ambiguously classified x - ray sources with unconstrained band ratios and @xmath280  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 in decades of decreasing x - ray - to - optical flux ratio .",

    "the steep effective photon indices for sources stacked in the `` galaxies '' region of figure  [ fig : r_vs_x ] suggest that there are relatively few obscured agn among these sources and that they are likely star - forming in nature ( although we can not exclude the presence of soft low - luminosity agn or agn / starburst composites ) .",
    "the flatter effective photon indices for sources in the traditional agn region , on the other hand , suggest that a significant fraction are in fact obscured agn , with the rest presumably a mix of unobscured agn and star - forming galaxies .",

    "our second classification scheme is a slight variation of the first and is similar to that presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition to the x - ray spectral properties , intrinsic x - ray luminosities , radio morphologies , variability , and optical spectroscopic classifications , we further classify ambiguous sources based on their x - ray - to - optical flux ratios .",

    "the remaining 109 sources were considered star - forming galaxies , although again some low - luminosity agn might be present .",
    "in contrast to our first scheme , this division should provide a more optimistic estimate of agn and a more pessimistic estimate of star - forming galaxies , as it attempts to address the issue of strong agn contamination for unclassified @xmath286 sources .",

    "the true number counts for each class are likely to lie somewhere in between these two determinations . given that the stacked effective photon indices of the ambiguous sources in the agn region are relatively hard , and that there is likely to be some soft agn contamination in the `` galaxies '' region , we will adopt the second scheme presented above ( optimistic agn , pessimistic galaxies ) .",
    "we can compare our pessimistic galaxy sample to the bayesian selected sample of normal / starburst galaxies in the cdfs from @xcite .",
    "using only cdf sources with spectroscopic redshifts @xmath287 and a selection based on x - ray luminosities , observed x - ray hardness ratios , and x - ray - to - optical flux ratios , @xcite identified a total of 210 normal / starburst galaxies .",
    "this number is substantially larger than the 109 galaxies in our pessimistic galaxy sample or even the 175 galaxies in our _ optimistic _ sample and warrants investigation .",
    "part of this discrepancy arises from the fact that @xcite use the catalog of @xcite rather than that of a03 ; there are 18 @xcite sources in their sample which are not in the main catalogs of a03 . of the remaining 192 @xcite galaxies , we find 120 and 94 matches to our optimistic and pessimistic samples , respectively .",
    "of the 55 sources classified as galaxies here but not by @xcite , @xmath31% were objects lacking spectroscopic redshifts or with @xmath288 ( 15 cases ) while it is unclear why the rest failed their criteria ( 40 cases ) .",
    "conversely , sources classified as galaxies by @xcite but agn here were objects which had a combination of @xmath284 ( 62 cases ) , @xmath266  @xmath1 ( 44 cases ) , hardness ratio @xmath289 ( 23 cases ) , or @xmath269  erg  s@xmath2 ( 20 cases ) . based on our criteria",
    ", we expect significant agn contamination to be present in the @xcite sample .",
    "we note that the upward trend seen below @xmath290  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 in the agn number counts in figure  [ fig : num_cnts_agn_gal ] and elsewhere is likely caused by obscured agn which have composite x - ray spectra , such that a significant fraction of the soft - band flux is likely due to either star formation associated with the host galaxy or complex agn spectra ( e.g. , partial covering , scattered radiation , or reflection ) .",
    "the agn number - count slopes are flat in both bands , indicating that we are now observing agn beyond the differential peak in the agn number - count distribution . while the x - ray source densities of agns , in a differential sense ( see lower panel of figure  [ fig : num_cnts_agn_gal ] ) , appear to be in a state of decline at x - ray fluxes below @xmath291  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 , the star - forming galaxy population is rising strongly ( nearly euclidean and consistent with the previously measured normal galaxy x - ray number counts of * ? ? ?",
    "the star - forming galaxy number counts also agree well with the predictions made by @xcite using the x - ray / radio correlation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the radio number counts of @xcite , indicating that there is a good correspondence between the x - ray and radio emission in these sources .    for completeness we also present the x - ray number counts for the 22 spectroscopically identified , galactic stars discovered in the cdfs .",
    "these high - latitude stars are typically old g , k , and m types which are thought to emit x - ray emission via magnetic flaring ; we refer the reader to @xcite , who have performed analyses on a subset of the x - ray - detected stars presented here . the number - count slope of the galactic stars is flat in the soft band and indeterminate in the hard band .",
    "we further subdivided the agn sample based on both optical and x - ray properties .",
    "unfortunately , the only meaningful optical division we can place is based on agn with broad lines reported in their optical spectra ( i.e. , type  1 ) , and those apparently lacking them ( i.e. , not obviously type  1 agn ) , since the optical spectra are not archived , adequately analyzed , nor typically of very high signal - to - noise .",
    "thus the `` not obviously type  1 '' category is probably too loose to provide much insight , as it is likely to include not only classic narrow - line agn ( type  2 ) , but also slightly more luminous versions of compton - thick agn like ngc  4945 and ngc  6240 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , xbongs @xcite , and other odd types .",
    "we further caution that spectral misclassifications are likely for some sources since broad lines may be apparent in certain parts of the optical spectrum but not others or may be missed due to host - galaxy contamination or poor signal - to - noise data ( e.g. , see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , there are a significant number of cdf sources with high photometric redshifts that could turn out to be broad - line agn ( see figure  [ fig : r_vs_z ] ) . given this likely incompleteness , the number counts for the optical type  1 and not obviously type  1 agn must be considered lower and upper limits , respectively . similarly , agn with column density estimates @xmath292",
    "@xmath1 were considered x - ray unobscured / mildly obscured agn , and those above x - ray obscured agn .",
    "again , we caution that this distinction is far from exact , as it is based on the fit of a relatively simple spectral model , which surely is inadequate considering the known spectral complexity exhibited by local agn ( e.g. , reflection , scattering , partial covering , host - galaxy contamination ) .",
    "such effects tend to contribute more soft flux than predicted by a simple model and therefore can lead to an underestimate of the column density or confuse the spectral fit .    from figure",

    "while this may be a legitimate effect , the ability to detect broad lines tends to decrease at fainter optical ( and hence x - ray ) fluxes , and thus we can not exclude the possibility that observational limitations contribute to this decline . considering agn by their x - ray properties yields similar , albeit less extreme , results .",
    "the source density of unobscured / mildly obscured agn gradually trails off below @xmath293  @xmath24  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 in both bands , ultimately reaching source densities @xmath1493 times lower than those of obscured agn at the cdf detection threshold .",

    "x - ray observations therefore appear to be much more effective at identifying agns , particularly ( more typical ) obscured agns .",
    "this conclusion is not entirely surprising given that the optical spectra of many agn in the cdfs are dominated by host - galaxy light .      while the agn source densities achieved above are impressive , it is important to understand the completeness of our x - ray selection of agn .",
    "it is likely , for instance , that we are still missing a significant fraction of low - luminosity agn ( primarily those which have steep x - ray spectra or fail to dominate over host - galaxy emission ) , as such agn are often difficult to identify even in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , the ueda xlf model consistently overestimates the soft - band number counts of @xmath330@xmath331  @xmath1 agn over the entire flux range , with the statistical deviation steadily increasing with decreasing flux from 119@xmath38 , and underestimates the soft - band number counts of @xmath332@xmath333  @xmath1 agn over the entire flux range , with the statistical deviation steadily increasing with decreasing flux from 16@xmath38 .",
    "note that this latter discrepancy is in the opposite sense to _ chandra _ s possible observational bias mentioned above and is therefore likely to be even worse . in the hard band , the agreement between the ueda xlf model and the data is good for @xmath327  @xmath1 , @xmath328@xmath329  @xmath1 , and @xmath334@xmath333  @xmath1 agn , but consistently overestimates the hard - band number counts of @xmath330@xmath331  @xmath1 agn over the flux range @xmath316  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 to @xmath335  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 , with the statistical deviation steadily increasing with decreasing flux from 16@xmath38 .",
    "some of the discrepancies between the individual luminosity and absorption bins and the ueda xlf may be due to our assumptions regarding the redshift distribution ( and hence the absorption and x - ray luminosity distributions ) .",
    "several arguments suggest that this is unlikely to be the case : ( 1 ) the ueda xlf overestimates the total number counts as well , where no redshift information is used .",
    "( 2 ) the agreement between the lowest and highest column density sources is fairly good .",
    "significant changes to the redshift distribution either way would worsen the agreement .",
    "( 3 ) if the redshift distribution is on average higher than we have estimated in @xmath26[sec : num_cnts_type ] , then sources from lower x - ray luminosity bins , where the overestimate is already bad , would move into higher ones where the agreement is already acceptably good ( thus worsening the agreement ) .",
    "( 4 ) the x - ray sources are unlikely to lie at significantly lower redshifts than those assumed given that the sources are not generally detected in the bluest optical bands , implying substantial redshifts or that they reside in severely underluminous galaxies .",
    "the latter is unlikely given what we know about the host galaxies of powerful agn in the nearby universe @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : cdf_nh ] shows the derived cdf @xmath336 distribution ( including errors ) and the extrapolated @xcite model .",
    "there is rough agreement between the data and model , although the cdf distribution clearly appears to be bimodel , while the @xcite model does not .",
    "these deviations are less obvious in figure  [ fig : num_cnts_lx ] because of the coarser @xmath336 binning and the effect contamination from star - forming host galaxies has on the x - ray fluxes of highly obscured agn . while the upper and lower limits on the overall @xmath336 determinations ( dashed and dotted lines , respectively ) are tight enough to exclude the possibility of this bimodality being spurious , the assumed redshift distribution for sources lacking redshifts could play a role in shaping the @xmath336 distribution .",
    "for instance , adopting a larger scatter in the redshift distribution might broaden the @xmath336 distribution to be more in line with the flat distribution from the @xcite model .",
    "alternatively , if we have systematically underestimated redshifts this would tend to shift the second @xmath337 peak toward higher values and increase discrepancies between the data and model at moderate column densities .",
    "we consider the cdf @xmath336 distribution shown in figure  [ fig : cdf_nh ] to be fairly robust , however , since it would take exceptionally large deviations in the adopted redshift distribution to change intrinsic @xmath336 values by more than a factor of a few given that @xmath338 .",
    "thus , it appears that the extrapolated @xcite @xmath336 distribution is not entirely appropriate for the cdf data . @xcite",
    "come to a similar conclusion using a more luminous subset of the cdf agn and an @xmath337 distribution derived instead from x - ray colors .",
    "the contributions to the soft and hard xrb from each cdf source type are shown in table  [ tab : stats ] , normalized by the average total flux density of the xrb [ taken from m03 in the soft band to be ( @xmath12  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2  deg@xmath6 and from @xcite in the hard band to be ( @xmath13  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2  deg@xmath6 ] . for sources brighter",
    "than observed in the cdfs ( i.e. , @xmath340  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 and @xmath341  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 ) , we have adopted total resolved flux - density contributions from the models of m03 , which are 19.2% in the soft band and 11.5% in the hard band ; we assume uncertainties of @xmath164% on these values estimated from figure  5 of m03 .",
    "the crude breakdown of these bright resolved fractions is 40% stars , 40% type  1 agn , 5% type  2 agn , 10% clusters , 5% galaxies in the soft band , and 1% stars , 69% type  1 agn , 20% type  2 agn , 8% clusters , and 2% galaxies in the hard band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when known , these values have been added to column  4 of table  [ tab : stats ] to produce total resolved xrb fractions in column  5 of table  [ tab : stats ] . in total , and neglecting possible large - scale structure effects and instrumental cross - calibration uncertainties , we find 89.5@xmath14% and 86.9@xmath15% of the xrb has been resolved in the soft and hard bands , respectively .",
    "we find that agn as a whole contribute @xmath1683% and @xmath1695% to the resolved soft and hard xrbs , respectively . dividing the agn further , we find that type  1 agn alone contribute significantly ( @xmath342% ) to the agn fraction of the resolved xrb in the soft band , but far less so ( @xmath343% ) in the hard band .",
    "x - ray unobscured / mildly obscured agn completely dominate ( @xmath344% ) the agn fraction of the resolved xrb in the soft band , and contribute nearly half ( @xmath345% ) in the hard band .",
    "if this latter trend continues to harder energies , it suggests that highly obscured x - ray sources will likely dominate the xrb emission at higher energies ( e.g. , closer to @xmath34640  kev peak of the xrb ) .",
    "this can be directly tested by performing similar analyses on deep 5.010.0  kev number counts from _ xmm - newton_. in contrast , star - forming galaxies comprise only @xmath1610% and @xmath162% of the soft and hard xrbs .",
    "starbursts appear to make up the bulk of the x - ray emission in the soft band , while quiescent galaxies apparently dominate in the hard band ; contamination from embedded , highly obscured agn may be responsible in the latter case .",
    "extrapolating the total number - count slopes from table  [ tab : slopes ] down to @xmath347  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 in the soft band and @xmath348  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 in the hard band can account for an additional @xmath349% and @xmath350% of the xrbs , respectively .",
    "we note , however , that some of the number - count slopes for the individual cdf source types are significantly steeper than the overall number - count slopes and that independent extrapolation of these slopes actually exceeds the total xrb by a large percentage in some cases .",
    "this suggests that ( 1 ) known point - source populations can explain all of the remaining unresolved xrb and ( 2 ) the steep slopes found for some source types must flatten in the decade of flux below the cdf sensitivity limits . as such",
    ", we contend that there is little room for extra contributions from , e.g. , a truly diffuse component .",
    "we additionally find that the number density of star - forming galaxies should overtake that of the agn just below @xmath351  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 in both bands , and these sources should contribute an additional @xmath29310% and @xmath2935% to the soft and hard xrb emission ( here we have assumed a flattening of the starburst number counts for sources as inferred from infrared galaxy number counts ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the overall contribution of galaxies to the xrb appears to be 1020% in the soft band and 26% in the hard band , indicating that if the cosmic star - formation rate evolves as @xmath352 then @xmath353 is likely to be near @xmath354 rather than a higher value ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with previous results from stacking analyses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the recently measured normal galaxy xlf @xcite .",
    "we note that we are using relatively broad x - ray bands , and that the resolved fraction at a given energy may change somewhat throughout these bandpasses .",
    "since the effective area of _ chandra _ falls off rapidly above 4  kev , we are likely to resolve more of the 24  kev xrb and less of the 48  kev xrb .",
    "an investigation into this is beyond the scope of this study , but has been undertaken by ( 2004 ; * ? ? ? * in preparation ) using the deep lockman hole and the cdfs .",
    "they perform photometry of the resolved source in several narrow x - ray bands , finding that the resolved fraction of the xrb is indeed sytematically lower at harder x - ray energies .",
    "they also find that the resultant x - ray spectrum of the unresolved xrb is consistent with that from a highly - obscured ( @xmath355@xmath333  @xmath1 for @xmath356 ) agn .",
    "we have combined the and x - ray samples , along with substantial public ancillary data , to examine the x - ray number counts as a function of source type .",
    "extensive simulations were carried out to quantify and correct for the completeness and flux bias problems which affect the cdf number counts .",
    "once corrected , we find that the number counts from the two fields are consistent with each other aside from sources detected in the 28  kev band below @xmath59  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 , where statistical deviations gradually increase to @xmath60 at the faintest flux levels .",
    "we also find that our overall number counts are consistent with previous determinations . in total , we have resolved 89.5@xmath14% and 86.9@xmath15% of the extragalactic 0.52.0  kev and 28  kev xrb , respectively .    using a classification scheme based on x - ray spectral properties , intrinsic x - ray luminosities , radio morphologies , variability , optical spectroscopic classifications , and x - ray - to - optical flux ratios ,",
    "we have separated the cdf x - ray sources into 698 agn ( split into optical type  1 and not obviously type  1 , and x - ray obscured and unobscured / mildly obscured ) , 109 star - forming galaxies ( split into starburst , quiescent , and elliptical ) , and 22 galactic stars , and determined their individual number counts .",
    "we additionally calculate the number - count slopes and normalizations below @xmath0 erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 for all source types assuming a single power - law model .",
    "we confirm that agn power the bulk of the extragalactic xrb , with only a small contribution from star - forming galaxies .",
    "the most significant contributions to the xrb are from sources with @xmath357  erg  s@xmath2 and @xmath292  @xmath1 in the soft band and @xmath320@xmath20  erg  s@xmath2 and an evenly - distributed range of absorption column densities in the hard band .",
    "this trend suggests that even less luminous , more highly obscured agn may in fact dominate the number counts at higher energies , where the xrb intensity peaks . at the cdf",
    "flux limits , the overall agn source densities are 7166@xmath5 sources  deg@xmath6 and 4558@xmath7 sources  deg@xmath6 , respectively , factors of @xmath820 higher than found in the deepest optical spectroscopic surveys .",
    "while star - forming galaxies make up a small fraction of sources with fluxes higher than @xmath291  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 in both bands , their numbers climb steeply below this flux such that they eventually achieve source densities of 1727@xmath9 sources  deg@xmath6 and 711@xmath10 sources  deg@xmath6 at the cdf flux limits ( with starburst galaxies making the largest contribution ) and comprise up to @xmath358% of the sources at the faintest x - ray fluxes .",
    "extrapolation of the number - count slopes for galaxy source types can account for all of the remaining unresolved soft and hard xrbs .",
    "moreover , within a factor of a few below the current cdf soft - band flux limit , the sky density of star - forming galaxies will likely overtake that of agn .    we have also compared the @xcite xlf with our x - ray number counts .",
    "while the agreement is generally good for most subsets of cdf sources , it appears that the extrapolated xlf requires some significant refinements before it will be able to reproduce the data with sufficient accuracy .",
    "further improvements to our study can be made in several ways .",
    "constraining the bright - flux end of the number counts for all of our source types would be particularly useful for determining more accurate slopes and xrb contributions .",
    "additional observations of the 2  ms with _",
    "chandra _ would ( 1 ) yield additional photons to discriminate better between agn and galaxies and model spectral complexities for better absorption column density and luminosity estimates , ( 2 ) allow confirmation of the sharp rise in the number counts of both star - forming galaxies and moderate - to - high obscuration ( @xmath359 ) agn that we find here , and ( 3 ) perhaps provide evidence for their eventual flattening as is required by the overall xrb flux density . upcoming ancillary observations at infrared ( _ spitzer _ ) and radio ( vla ) wavelengths , as well as detailed analyses of the existing optical spectra , would be extremely helpful for refining our agn and galaxy subclassifications . finally , a high - sensitivity , high spatial resolution x - ray telescope able to probe to @xmath23  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2 in the 1040  kev band is desperately needed to resolve the peak of the xrb and determine once and for all the nature and composition of the xrb .",
