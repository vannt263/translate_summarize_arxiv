    "the fit with the transmission model gives n@xmath52 @xmath7 for _ bzk_4892 and @xmath53 @xmath7 for _ bzk_8608 , and is statistically indistinguishable from the fit with a reflection model .",

    "assuming such a bolometric correction , we estimate l@xmath60  erg  s@xmath5 for _ bzk_4892 and @xmath61  erg  s@xmath5 for _ bzk_8608",
    ". these very high luminosities , if expressed in solar units , correspond to l@xmath62 and @xmath63 . when powered by star formation ,",
    "similar luminosities require star formation rates ( sfr ) in the host galaxies at the level of 100 - 1000  m@xmath9  yr@xmath5 . it is interesting thus to compare these estimates to the inferred sfr for the two _ bzk _  galaxies , in order to compare the relative agn and sfr contributions .    from the stellar sed ( uv to the near - ir rest frame ; fig .",
    "3 ) , we estimate @xmath64  m@xmath9  yr@xmath5 for _ bzk_4892 , corrected for dust reddening based on the observed uv slope ( see d07 for more details ) .",
    "it is quite possible though that also the stellar uv emission might be optically thick . if we interpret its mid - ir emission ( 591 @xmath10jy at 24@xmath10 m ) as due to star formation this would imply a whopping sfr@xmath65  m@xmath9  yr@xmath5 , demonstrating that the mid - ir is likely completely dominated by the agn ( this object is among the most extreme mid - ir excess galaxies in the sample of d07 ) .",
    "the sed fit with a star forming galaxy template ( fig .",
    "3 ) shows an excess emission already at 5.8   ( observed frame ) probably due to the agn contribution .",
    "the sed in the irac bands is indeed showing a steep power law , extending all the way to 24 . due to its faint optical counterpart ( i@xmath325 ab ) , _",
    "bzk_4892 has high mid - infrared to optical flux ratio , f(24)/f(r)@xmath32000 and therefore is also classified as a dust - obscured galaxy ( dog , dey et al .",
    "it is an extreme object also in the fiore et al .",
    "( 2008 ) sample .",
    "alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2006 ) reports a 70   flux of @xmath66 mjy for this galaxy , which is also likely affected by the agn emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the galaxy is seen at 1.4 ghz with a flux of 80  @xmath10jy in the vla data of miller et al .",
    "if due to star formation , using the radio - ir correlation , this would imply sfr@xmath67  m@xmath9  yr@xmath5 . inspecting the publicly available apex+laboca 870   map of goods - s ( weiss et al .",
    "2009 ) , we find a 3@xmath33 signal at the position of _ bzk_4892 of 3.3  mjy , which would also convert into a similar sfr , @xmath68  m@xmath9  yr@xmath5 .",
    "even for the most luminous quasars it is generally found that the far - ir emission in the sub - mm bands is due to star formation .",
    "if this is the case also for _ bzk_4892 , our results suggest that the galaxy is witnessing also very powerful star formation activity at the level of 500 - 1000  m@xmath9  yr@xmath5 . only 5 - 10% of this is seen directly in the uv , implying that also the uv - emission from stars is optically thick , similarly to local ulirgs ( e.g. , goldader et al .",
    "2002 ; da cunha et al .",
    "2010 ) and to what is expected to be found in major mergers . however , we notice that the radio and 870@xmath10 m derived sfrs would formally imply l@xmath69  erg  s@xmath5 , comparable to what inferred for the obscured agn .",
    "hence , the agn is likely contributing an important fraction of the total l@xmath58 .",
    "the morphology of the galaxy from hst+acs imaging is suggestive of a merger , showing two distinct clumps in the uv in the rest frame . when smoothing , after excluding the two bright knots , we detect significant faint low - level emission in the summed @xmath70 band , extended over a diameter of about 0.75(6  kpc )",
    "overall , this is consistent with the size of a massive galaxy at z@xmath71 , and we can not exclude that the two uv knots might be just luminous hii regions inside a big disk galaxy .",
    "the photometric information is of lower quality for _ bzk_8608 due to its overall faintness .",
    "the sfr inferred from the uv is also 70  m@xmath72 .",
    "this object is also a mid - ir excess source in d07 sample ( by a less extreme factor of 6 ) , with s@xmath73jy ( @xmath31/10 of _ bzk_4892 ) , although it is not a dog .",
    "the sed ( fig .",
    "3 ) might also be consistent with pure stellar emission , but a deviation from the star formation template is observed at the @xmath74 m band .",
    "this galaxy is not detected at 70   and 870 , suggesting a lower agn luminosity and/or sfr . inspecting the vla 1.4 ghz data ( miller et al .",
    "2008 ) we detect a faint @xmath42 source at its position with a flux of @xmath75jy .",
    "this corresponds to a luminosity @xmath76 l@xmath77 and sfr@xmath78  m@xmath9  yr@xmath5 . if the radio signal is real and not due to agn , also in this case the stellar emission appears to be heavily obscured , i.e. optically thick in the uv , as expected for very active starbursts and mergers .",
    "the hst+acs imaging of this galaxy ( fig .",
    "3 ) is not particularly telling .",
    "for both galaxies we derive similar estimates of the stellar masses , at the level of @xmath79 .",
    "our results thus support the picture that the luminous , compton thick agn that we discovered are hosted by fairly massive galaxies at @xmath80 - 3 , that at the same time also host vigorous star formation activity heavily obscured by dust .",
    "this is relevant in the agn - host galaxy co - evolution scenario , in which a phase of rapid , heavily obscured bh growth accompanied by intense obscured star - formation is predicted ( silk & rees 1998 , fabian 1999 , granato et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we derive a crude value of the volume density of compton thick agn with high ew iron k@xmath0 emission , based on our 2 detections .",
    "we conservatively use the full redshift range explored by the _ bzk",
    "_   selection ( z@xmath271.4 - 3 ) , finding a space density of @xmath81 mpc@xmath82 .",
    "this is consistent with the predictions of the gilli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) x - ray background synthesis model , for compton thick agn with l@xmath83  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "however , we notice that our sampling of l@xmath84  erg  s@xmath5 agn with compton thick absorption at @xmath85 might be substantially incomplete due to selection effects , and the luminosity of at least one of the _ bzk _   galaxies in this paper might be substantially higher than the adopted @xmath86  erg  s@xmath5 limit .",
    "we emphasize that the sources presented here have x - ray spectra that are the high - luminosity analogous of those of local prototype compton thick agn .",
    "this discovery represents one of the first clear - cut evidence for this class of objects at high redshift .",
    "our results confirm that indeed there is a population of compton thick qso among massive , star - forming , dust obscured galaxies , as suggested by several studies ( d07 , fiore et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 , treister et al .",
    "2010 , alexander et al .",
    "2008 , lanzuisi et al .",
    "2009 ) , and as predicted by models of merger - driven agn / galaxy co - evolution ( silk & rees 1998 , fabian 1999 , di matteo et al .",
    "indeed , these luminous compton thick quasars appear to be hosted by galaxies with optically thick uv emission , which are a relative small minority among bzks ( daddi et al 2007a ) , and imply the presence of a dense starburst usually connected with mergers .",
    "this seems to agree with evolutionary scenarios , where mergers induce both rapid accretion onto smbh and intense star - formation activity .",
    "the two sources presented here have high intrinsic x - ray and bolometric luminosity , and bright iron k@xmath0 line , allowing their identification .",
    "they might represent just the tip of the iceberg of a much larger population of highly obscured agn with somewhat lower intrinsic luminosity , whose iron lines are still remaining hardly detectable even in the deepest hard x - ray surveys . for example , the gilli et al .",
    "model predicts a @xmath87 higher space density of compton thick sources with l@xmath88  erg  s@xmath5 . detecting iron lines in galaxies with such luminosities might be challenging with current facilities , even if they have similar ew as in _ bzk_4892 and _ bzk_8608 .",
