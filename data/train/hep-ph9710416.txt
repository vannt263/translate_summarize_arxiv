    "experiments at high energy hadron colliders provide an excellent opportunity to probe the interactions of the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "recent observation of electroweak gauge boson pair production at the fermilab tevatron have provided further confirmation of the electroweak standard model ( sm ) and have significantly tightened the constraints on possible non - standard model self - interactions of the electroweak gauge bosons  @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xmath8 production  @xcite can be used to study the @xmath9 vertex , @xmath10 production can be used to probe the @xmath11 vertex , and @xmath12 production  @xcite is sensitive to both the @xmath9 and @xmath11 vertex functions .",
    "furthermore , efforts have also been made to search for evidence of non - zero @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings in @xmath13 ( @xmath1 )  @xcite and @xmath14 production  @xcite .",
    "these couplings vanish in the sm at tree level .",
    "however , if new interactions beyond the sm are responsible for non - zero @xmath4 or @xmath5 couplings , then @xmath7 production could provide a clean signal for new physics .",
    "previous studies of @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings in hadronic @xmath7 production were based on leading order calculations  @xcite .",
    "next - to - leading order calculations of @xmath15 production in the sm have shown that the nlo corrections are largest at high values of the photon transverse momentum and high values of the @xmath7 invariant mass  @xcite .",
    "these are the same regions of phase space where the effects of non - standard @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings are most pronounced  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to include nlo corrections when probing for evidence of non - standard @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings in hadronic @xmath7 production .",
    "this paper presents a calculation of hadronic @xmath16 and @xmath14 production to @xmath6 , including the most general non - standard @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings , and the decay of the @xmath17 boson in the narrow width approximation . because of the larger @xmath18 branching ratio , the @xmath14 cross section is about a factor  3 larger than the combined @xmath19 and @xmath20 rates .",
    "this results in substantially better limits on anomalous @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings in the @xmath18 channel  @xcite .    to perform our calculation",
    ", we use the monte carlo method for nlo calculations described in ref .  @xcite . in the calculation",
    "the sm is assumed to be valid apart from anomalies in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 vertices . in particular , we assume the couplings of @xmath21 and @xmath17 bosons to quarks and leptons to be given by the sm , and that there are no non - standard couplings of the @xmath7 pair to two gluons  @xcite . the gluon fusion process , @xmath22 , is small in the sm  @xcite and is not considered in this paper .",
    "section  ii briefly reviews the method used to carry out the calculation , and describes how anomalous @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings are incorporated .    in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss how nlo qcd corrections influence the photon transverse momentum distribution , and derive sensitivity limits for non - standard @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings at nlo for the tevatron and lhc center - of - mass energies for various integrated luminosities .",
    "the photon transverse momentum distribution is the observable most sensitive to anomalous couplings  @xcite , and is used by cdf and d  to extract information on the @xmath4 and @xmath5 vertices  @xcite . at the tevatron , qcd corrections are modest , and slightly improve the sensitivity bounds .",
    "in contrast , at lhc energies , the inclusive nlo qcd corrections are quite large at high photon transverse momenta in the sm and reduce the sensitivity to anomalous @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings somewhat .",
    "the large qcd corrections are caused by a log squared enhancement factor in the @xmath23 partonic cross section at high photon transverse momentum ( @xmath24 ) , and the large quark - gluon luminosity at lhc energies .",
    "as in @xmath8  @xcite , @xmath10  @xcite , and @xmath12 production  @xcite , the effect of the qcd corrections at high @xmath24 at the lhc can be reduced by imposing a 0-jet requirement when searching for anomalous couplings .",
    "finally , summary remarks are given in sec .",
    "the calculation presented here generalizes the results of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite to include general ( non - standard model ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings .",
    "the calculation employs a combination of analytic and monte carlo integration techniques ; details of the method can be found in ref .",
    "the leptonic @xmath17 boson decays are incorporated in the narrow width approximation . in this approximation ,",
    "radiative @xmath17 decay diagrams , and graphs in which a virtual photon decays into a charged lepton pair can be ignored .",
    "radiative @xmath17 decays are of little interest when probing for non - standard couplings and can be suppressed by a suitable choice of cuts ( see sec .",
    "furthermore , in the narrow width approximation it is particularly easy to extend the nlo calculation of hadronic @xmath7 production in ref .",
    "@xcite to include the leptonic decay of the @xmath17 boson .",
    "the charged leptons are assumed to be massless in our calculation .      at lowest order in the sm , hadronic",
    "@xmath7 production proceeds via the feynman diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : smborn ] .",
    "non - standard @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings contribute via the graphs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonsmborn ] . at the leading - logarithm level , there are additional contributions to @xmath7 production which come from photon bremsstrahlung processes such as @xmath25 followed by photon bremsstrahlung from the final state quark .",
    "although the process @xmath26 is formally of @xmath27 , the photon fragmentation functions are of order @xmath28  @xcite ; thus the photon bremsstrahlung process is of the same order as the born process",
    ".    the nlo calculation of @xmath7 production includes contributions from the square of the born graphs , the interference between the born graphs and the virtual one - loop diagrams , and the square of the real emission graphs .",
    "the basic idea of the method employed here is to isolate the soft and collinear singularities associated with the real emission subprocesses by partitioning phase space into soft , collinear , and finite regions .",
    "this is done by introducing theoretical soft and collinear cutoff parameters , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . using dimensional regularization  @xcite ,",
    "the soft and collinear singularities are exposed as poles in @xmath31 ( the number of space - time dimensions is @xmath32 with @xmath31 a small number ) .",
    "the infrared singularities from the soft and virtual contributions are then explicitly canceled while the collinear singularities are factorized and absorbed into the definition of the parton distribution functions .",
    "the remaining contributions are finite and can be evaluated in four dimensions .",
    "the monte carlo program thus generates @xmath33-body ( for the born and virtual contributions ) and @xmath34-body ( for the real emission contributions ) final state events .",
    "the @xmath33- and @xmath34-body contributions both depend on the cutoff parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , however , when these contributions are added together to form a suitably inclusive observable , all dependence on the cutoff parameters cancels .",
    "the numerical results presented in this paper are insensitive to variations of the cutoff parameters .    except for the virtual contribution ,",
    "the @xmath6 corrections are all proportional to the born cross section .",
    "it is easy to incorporate the leptonic @xmath17 decays into those terms which are proportional to the born cross section ; one simply replaces @xmath35 with @xmath36 or @xmath37 in the relevant formulae .",
    "when working at the amplitude level , the @xmath17 boson decay is trivial to implement ; the @xmath17 boson polarization vector , @xmath38 , is simply replaced by the corresponding @xmath39 or @xmath18 decay current in the amplitude .",
    "details of the amplitude level calculations for the born and real emission subprocesses can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the only term in which it is more difficult to incorporate the @xmath17 boson decay is the virtual contribution . rather than undertake the non - trivial task of recalculating the virtual correction term for the case of a leptonically decaying @xmath17 boson",
    ", we have instead opted to use the virtual correction for a real on - shell @xmath17 boson which we subsequently decay ignoring spin correlations .",
    "when spin correlations are ignored , the spin summed squared matrix element factorizes into separate production and decay squared matrix elements . neglecting spin correlations",
    "slightly modifies the shapes of the angular distributions of the final state leptons , but does not alter the total cross section as long as no angular cuts ( _ e.g. _ , rapidity cuts ) are imposed on the final state leptons . for realistic rapidity cuts ,",
    "cross sections are changed by typically 10% when spin correlations are neglected .",
    "since the size of the finite virtual correction is only about @xmath40 the size of the born cross section , the overall effect of neglecting the spin correlations in the finite virtual correction is expected to be negligible compared to the combined @xmath41 uncertainty from the parton distribution functions , the choice of the factorization scale @xmath42 , and higher order qcd corrections .      in @xmath43 , the timelike virtual photon and/or @xmath17 boson couples to essentially massless fermions , which ensures that effectively @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "this fact , together with gauge invariance of the on - shell photon , restricts the tensor structure of the @xmath46 vertex sufficiently to allow only four free parameters .",
    "the most general non - standard @xmath4 vertex function ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vertex ] for notation ) is  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the @xmath17 boson mass .",

    "( [ eq : genvertex ] ) as the energy scale in the denominator of the overall factor and the terms proportional to @xmath66 . for a different mass scale , @xmath67 ,",
    "all subsequent results can be obtained by scaling @xmath68 @xmath69 by a factor @xmath70 @xmath71 .",
    "tree level unitarity restricts the @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings uniquely to their standard model values at asymptotically high energies  @xcite .",
