    "one of the oldest , unsettled problems of quantum mechanics is that of the tunneling time @xcite .",
    "the seemingly simple question is how long does a tunneling particle stay in the classically forbidden region .",
    "the question has generated continuous interest both in theory and experiment and still remains controversial @xcite .",
    "one source of difficulty in dealing with this problem is the fact there is no generally accepted time operator in quantum mechanics that obeys a canonical commutation relation with the hamiltonian .",
    "this was shown to be impossible for bound systems by pauli because such a time operator would generate energy translations lower than the ground state @xcite .",
    "numerous works have defined non - standard time operators that work around the pauli objection @xcite such as restricted non - self - adjoint time operators @xcite or generalized measurement @xcite . in this work",
    "we are concerned with another kind of time operator , which measures time differences , rather than absolute time @xcite .",
    "such a dwell time operator commutes with the hamiltonian and represents how long a particle spends in a region of space @xcite .",
    "we argue this operator is more appropriate to the question of tunneling time .",
    "the issue remains , however , how such an operator can be measured in an operational way in a laboratory : if one prepares an incident wave packet , how does one know when to start the clock , or how to stop it ?",
    "there have been direct methods proposed for measuring the tunneling time for a particle prepared in a gaussian wave packet . in this situation",
    ", it is the group delay , or shift of the peak of the wave packet that is used .",
    "however , such an approach has been criticized because the tunneling time is defined as the arrival time of the peak of the wave packet after the barrier @xcite . when this definition is used to calculate traversal velocities as the ratio of the length of the barrier to the tunneling time",
    ", it leads to the hartman effect which exhibits superluminal velocities @xcite .",
    "this draw back leads us to consider other definitions . an ingenious indirect way to measure the tunneling time",
    "was proposed by bttiker @xcite by refining rybachenko s larmor clock idea @xcite .",
    "the idea is to attach a stopwatch to the particle that would turn on when the particle was in the tunneling region , and turn off again when it emerged .",
    "this is accomplished by using a particle with spin , and the physics of larmor precession : by applying a small magnetic field only in the classically forbidden region , the spin will precess , and the ratio of the subtended spin angle to the larmor frequency defines the tunneling time , @xmath0 . despite the conceptual clarity of this idea , the fact the spin experiences different barrier heights depending on its orientation leads also to spin rotation in a direction perpendicular to the precession plane , which when divided by the larmor frequency gives another time , @xmath1 .",
    "this effect provides an interpretational difficulty of which angle to use ( if this is indeed the correct procedure ) .",
    "bttiker suggested using a combination of both times , @xmath2 , while others advocated both times being used separately as time scales , despite the fact @xmath1 can be negative @xcite . while these times are intuitive , the argument is heuristic since they are not derived from an operator .",
    "steinberg stressed the fact that the tunneling time can only be defined for the particles that actually tunnel through the barrier , and consequently this definition only applies to a small fraction of all particles in the system that are naturally post - selected @xcite .",
    "such a post - selected average can be calculated as a weak value of a time operator @xcite , where the spin functions as a meter .",
    "steinberg considered a projection operator on the tunneling region scaled by the inverse particle current as the system operator .",
    "he found that the larmor times @xmath0 and @xmath1 could be understood as the real and imaginary parts of the weak value expression .",
    "the connection between the results of a generalized measurement and the measured operator is quite subtle . to further understand this interplay , dressel _",
    "et al_. @xcite proposed the use of generalized eigenvalues of an operator , called contextual values ( cvs ) , which would be weighted with the frequencies of detector outputs in order to calculate averages and moments of system operator .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to reconsider the larmor clock system which introduces a natural way to approach the tunneling problem .",
    "however , we deal with it by introducing a hermitian observable for the time operator .",
    "we consider the larmor clock system as a generalized detector and use the larmor times as detector outputs , rather than as system tunneling times , that will enable us to reconstruct the average and higher moments of the dwell time operator .",
    "this formalism also allows us to define the tunneling time as the conditioned average of the dwell time operator , and we find results which are related , but not identical to , the weak value results of steinberg @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy originates from the use of a different starting operator , and the noncommutativity of the unitary part of the measurement operator with the post - selection when the full dwell time operator is considered @xcite .",
    "this approach also gives a pragmatic prescription for experimental implementation of this idea .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ tunneling_time_measurement ] , we introduce some elementary properties of the one - dimensional scattering system , the dwell time operator and the weak value . in sec .",
    "[ larmor_system ] , we analyze the larmor system based on the generalized measurement and cv approach in detail .",

    "[ spin_rotation ] , and the detailed results of cvs for different shapes of the potential barrier in sec .",
    "[ decomposition_and_measurement ] . the tunneling time defined as a conditioned average of the dwell time operator",
    "is shown in sec .",
    "[ conditioned average of the dwell time operator ] , and we provide the second moment of the dwell time operator in sec . [ second_moment ] .",
    "we compare steinberg s approach @xcite with ours in sec .",
    "[ comparison_with_another_idea ] . finally , we give our conclusions in sec.[conclusion ] .",
    "let us consider a particle of mass @xmath3 with energy @xmath4 in a one - dimensional system with the spatial coordinate @xmath5 and a potential barrier centered at @xmath6 , @xmath7 . in the position representation , the complete basis of scattering stationary states of the hamiltonian @xmath8 have the following forms for the left ( l ) and",
    "( r ) incoming states , @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 takes the value @xmath12 in the barrier region @xmath13 $ ] and is zero elsewhere .",
    "the coefficients , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are the transmission and reflection amplitudes of left / right coming states , respectively .",
    "since the reflection phases can depend on the incident direction , we keep the labels @xmath16 .",
    "we omit any explicit expression for the states in the interval @xmath13 $ ] because it depends on the details of the potential .",
    "when we consider the scattering process , there is a dilemma : on the one hand , in the tunneling problem ( before interaction with the potential barrier ) the particle is free . on the other hand ,",
    "the free particle eigenfunctions extend over all space with uniform density , so there is always an interaction with the potential barrier . to avoid this difficulty , we use a wave packet to describe the particle . an initial wave packet prepared at @xmath17 , @xmath18 on the left hand side of the barrier , propagates toward the barrier , taking time @xmath19 before interaction with the barrier .",
    "we write the initial state by using the left coming positive momentum state @xmath20 , @xmath21 , as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a sharply peaked momentum distribution at mean momentum @xmath25 and insures only positive momentum contribution to the integral .",
    "moreover , we assume the condition @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , to make sure the particle is in the tunneling regime .",
    "the dwell time operator for a particle staying in a region of interest @xmath13 $ ] is defined as @xmath28 with @xmath29 , the system hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "for the initial wave packet ( [ initialstate ] ) , the expectation value of this operator gives a momentum averaged dwell time , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the dwell time which is defined within the context of a stationary state scattering problem as the average number of particles within a region , @xmath13 $ ] , divided by the average number entering the region per unit time , @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the incoming probability current density and @xmath34 is the left coming scattering state of the time independent schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "thus we see the total dwell time expectation is simply the weighted average of @xmath31 over all @xmath35 .",
    "since the dwell time operator commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath36=0 $ ] @xcite ( see appendix a ) , the dwell time operator can be expressed in the scattering basis , @xmath37 by defining four elements of the operator , @xmath38 with @xmath39 for right @xmath40 and left @xmath41 coming states , respectively .",
    "the off diagonal elements of the matrix in the scattering basis @xmath42 are @xmath43 which confirm the operator is hermitian . when @xmath44 , the element @xmath45 is the same as the definition of the dwell time in eq .",
    "( [ dwelltime(k ) ] ) but with incoming state from right or left ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "we wish to pick a specific wavenumber @xmath35 and measure the expectation value of the dwell time operator for that wavenumber , so we define the @xmath35 dependent dwell time operator @xmath47 in what follows , we will focus on @xmath48 rather than @xmath49 .",
    "we will see in the next section why @xmath35 dependent dwell time operator is more relevant for us .",
    "the weak value , as a result of weakly measuring a operator @xmath50 , is assigned if a system is preselected in an initial state @xmath51 and post - selected on a final state @xmath52 . to illustrate this ,",
    "a system operator @xmath50 is weakly coupled to a detector momentum operator @xmath53 , and its time - dependent interaction hamiltonian is @xmath54 where the interaction profile @xmath55 gives an effective coupling parameter @xmath56 over the time interval @xmath57 .",
    "then the result of measuring the operator @xmath50 , subject to the pre and post - selection , is given by @xmath58    now , we want to consider a wave packet tunneling through the potential barrier and calculate how long it takes to do so , the tunneling time . in this case , the weak value expression of the dwell time operator intuitively gives the solution to this problem , since the tunneling time is defined by the state which is initially prepared on the left hand side of the barrier ( for a case of left coming wave packet ) , but later on is found at the right hand side .",
    "we consider the initial state @xmath59 , which describes the right moving free particles on the left region before interaction with the potential barrier , as well as a post - selected state @xmath60 describing a particle moving to the right on the right hand side of the barrier . in this case , the weak value of the dwell time operator @xmath48 is calculated to be @xmath61 which involves the sum of dwell time with the off - diagonal element of dwell time operator amplified by @xmath62 .",
    "to gain deeper insight into this result , the contextual value ( cv ) formalism @xcite puts forward a more general starting point and the weak value is obtained as a special case in this formalism .",
    "to more deeply understand how this pre- and post- selected quantity can be measured , we use the cv formalism to construct the result that can be measured in the lab .",
    "this approach gives a conceptually clear method for constructing the conditional average of the dwell time operator . to measure the tunneling time indirectly by using the physical detector",
    ", we use the larmor clock @xcite which is a particular realization of a von neumann - style interaction @xcite for a meter corresponding to a spin @xmath63 particle .",
    "the larmor system is defined in the weak coupling regime , so we can compare the measurable tunneling time to the weak value .",
    "the larmor clock measurement scheme is when a small uniform magnetic field pointing in @xmath64 direction , @xmath65 , is confined to the barrier region .",
    "suppose that the quantum particle has spin @xmath66 and is initially polarized in the @xmath67 direction in the incident beam . to measure the dwell time operator inside the tunneling region",
    ", we consider the spin as our detector .",
    "the hamiltonian of the larmor system is then given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the larmor frequency , @xmath70 is the gyromagnetic ratio , and @xmath71 is the absolute value of the magnetic moment .",
    "the stationary solution of this hamiltonian is a combination of two plane waves with spin components .",
    "again , we only consider the incoming scattering stationary states , which are a complete basis with the following position representation .",
    "the spinful scattering states generalize to @xmath72 , where the scattering states of the left and right coming state for the spin @xmath73 in the position , @xmath5 , domain are @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the eigenstates of @xmath76 .",
    "they are delta function normalized , @xmath77 .",
    "the transmission and reflection probabilities of left or right coming particles for spin @xmath73 components are defined as @xmath78 . for the spinless case ,",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 merge to @xmath81 and @xmath15 , and only two eigenstates , @xmath82 , exist . even though the tunneling problem is most naturally treated as a time dependent wave packet traversing the barrier",
    ", it is possible nevertheless to develop a stationary approach so the scattering problem can be expressed in terms of the scattering amplitude at a given energy and we simply focus on the stationary state solution at momentum @xmath35 .",
    "we , therefore , consider the free particle state vector of the hamiltonian , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , for @xmath21 where @xmath85 is the initial time .",
    "to describe the scattering experiment from the potential barrier , we take our initial incoming state vector to be @xmath86 which never experiences the potential barrier and the state we post - select on after scattering to be @xmath87 . the connection between pre- and post - selection states",
    "is given by the scattering matrix ( s - matrix ) @xmath88 which contains the effect of interaction .",
    "since the collision conserves energy , the s - matrix only connects momentum states with the same energy . for the @xmath12d scattering case ( including the spin degree of freedom )",
    ", we can represent the s - matrix for the momentum @xmath35 as @xmath89 matrices , @xmath90 where the @xmath89 matrices are in the basis of left and right movers , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "now , we specialize the results by an approximation based on the required condition of the larmor system : the applied magnetic field is small so the change in potential energy created by this field is very small compared to both the height of the barrier and the difference between the height of the barrier and the kinetic energy .",
    "this condition additionally gives weak interaction between the system and the detector .",
    "the weakness condition allows us to approximate the transmission and reflection amplitudes to first order in @xmath93 @xmath94 , \\nonumber\\\\ r_{\\pm}^{l / r}&\\simeq & r^{l / r } \\left [ 1\\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_l(\\tau_{zr}+i\\tau_{yr}^{l / r})\\right ] , \\label{approximation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the times @xmath95 are defined as the derivatives of the transmitted or reflected probability of the barrier , and the derivative of its phase .",
    "for example , if we consider the box potential @xmath96 , the expressions of @xmath97 and @xmath98 are @xmath99 where @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "the amplitude related times @xmath97 come from the logarithmic derivative of the transmitted and reflected probabilities ( @xmath57 and @xmath102 ) , and @xmath103 are phase ( @xmath104 ) related times .",
    "the times ( [ larmor_times ] ) are the larmor times that bttiker defined to represent the tunneling time @xcite .",
    "the left and right coming dependence of the amplitudes only belong to the phase of the reflected amplitude , @xmath105 because the transmitted phase is the same for both directions .",
    "thus the superscript @xmath16 of the times only appears in @xmath106 . a more detailed discussion of eq . ( [ larmor_times ] ) for the arbitrary potential case",
    "is given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now , we suppose that the initially prepared joint state of the system and detector is a product state , @xmath107 .",
    "as time goes on , the joint state evolves under a unitary evolution which contains the system - detector interaction : the interaction of the system state both with the barrier @xmath7 and the spin through the applied infinitesimal magnetic field . as @xmath108",
    ", the system will again be in scattering states given from the @xmath109 scattering states .",
    "the unitary interaction will , then , entangle the system with the detector so that performing a direct measurement on the detector ( spin system ) will lead to an indirect measurement being performed on the system .    compared to a von - neumann interaction eq .",
    "( [ int_hamil_general ] ) , @xmath76 plays the role of detector @xmath53 .",
    "consequently , the azimuthal angle of this axis , which is the phase difference between spin @xmath73 components , will be the conjugate pointer position @xcite .",
    "therefore , spin measurement for an arbitrary direction is analogous to measuring some combination of the free particle detector s position and momentum degree of freedom .",
    "we measure , after the barrier , the spin post - selecting on the @xmath110 direction for both the transmitted and the reflected particles .",
    "the two orthonormal spin states ( experimentally chosen ) are @xmath111 and @xmath112 .    since the system and detector states are entangled , a measurement on a particular detector spin @xmath113 is equivalent to the measurement operator @xmath114 on the system , @xmath115\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv&\\hat{m}_m^{0}+\\omega_l\\hat{m}_m^{(1)}\\label{measurement_operator},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 .",
    "the measurement of the spin state is simultaneously accompanied by the measurement of the position or momentum of the particle , since our momentum states , @xmath117 contain the left / right position information .",
