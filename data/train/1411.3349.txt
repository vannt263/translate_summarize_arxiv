    "we start with the scattering of two color dipoles ( concretely , e.g. two quark - antiquark pairs ) of respective transverse sizes @xmath2 and @xmath3 with the ordering @xmath4 .    at low energy ,",
    "the forward elastic scattering amplitude of the dipoles consists in the exchange of a pair of gluons .",
    "since the dipoles are colorless , this exchange can take place only if their sizes are comparable ( on a logarithmic scale ) , and if the scattering occurs at coinciding impact parameters .",
    "once these conditions are fulfilled , the cross section is parametrically proportional to  @xmath5 .",
    "let us go to larger center - of - mass energies @xmath6 by boosting the small dipole to the rapidity @xmath7 .",
    "the most probable fock state at the time of the interaction is then a dense state of gluons , which may be represented by a set of dipoles @xcite ( see the sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig : picture]a ) .",
    "the amplitude is now enhanced by the number of these dipoles which have a size of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "we may define a `` one - event amplitude '' @xmath8 , which is related to the probability that gluons are exchanged between one given realization of the dipole evolution and the target dipole . if @xmath9 denotes the number of dipoles in a given realization of the evolution up to rapidity @xmath10 of size @xmath11 , starting with a dipole of size @xmath2 , then @xmath12 , where it is understood that the impact parameters of the dipoles which scatter need to coincide ( up to a distance of order of the smallest size ) .",
    "of course , the dipole number fluctuates from event to event , and so does @xmath8 .",
    "the physical amplitude measured in an experiment is proportional to the average of the latter over events , namely over realizations of the dipole evolution .",
    "we conclude that _ the scattering of two dipoles of respective sizes @xmath2 and @xmath3 probes the density of gluons of transverse size @xmath3 , at a given impact parameter , in typical quantum fluctuations of a source dipole of size @xmath2 appearing in the quantum evolution over the rapidity @xmath10_. +    m0.35 | m0.35     diagrams contributing to the forward elastic scattering amplitude of a dipole off another dipole ( a ) , and off a nucleus ( b ) . in the latter case ,",

    "whose size is larger than the inverse saturation momentum of the nucleus exchange an arbitrary number of pairs of gluons with independent nucleons in the nucleus , eventually leading to a resummation _  la _ glauber - mueller , and physically , to absorption . ]    &     diagrams contributing to the forward elastic scattering amplitude of a dipole off another dipole ( a ) , and off a nucleus ( b ) . in the latter case ,",

    "+ &    we turn to the case in which instead of the dipole of size @xmath3 , the target consists in a large nucleus . at low energy ,",
    "the dipole now scatters through multiple gluon exchanges since the nucleus is dense .",
    "the glauber - mueller summation of the latter implemented in the mclerran - venugopalan model  @xcite gives the scattering amplitude in the form @xmath13 .",
    "a new momentum scale @xmath14 is generated : it is the saturation momentum of the nucleus , and grows with the nucleus mass number @xmath15 like @xmath16 .",
    "this amplitude may actually be approximated by a heaviside @xmath17 function : @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "this has the advantage of simplifying the interpretation of the scattering of the evolved dipole with the nucleus .",
    "if one increases the center - of - mass energy by boosting the dipole , then at the time of the interaction , in each event , the nucleus `` sees '' a set of dipoles .",
    "the interaction takes place if and only if at least one dipole in this set has a size larger than the inverse saturation momentum .",
    "hence @xmath19 if at least one of the dipoles in the evolution is larger than @xmath20 , or 0 else .",
    "the cross section that is measured in an experiment by counting events ( which technically is an averaging of @xmath21 over the events ) is thus the probability that at least one dipole in the fock state of the source dipole evolved to the time of the interaction has a size larger than @xmath20 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : picture]b ) .",
    "hence , while dipole - dipole scattering probes the bulk of the quantum state , _ the scattering of a dipole of size @xmath2 with a nucleus is sensitive to the probability distribution of the size of the largest fluctuation generated in the quantum evolution of the dipole , _ namely , in a mathematical language , to the _ statistics of extremes . _",
    "we have just argued that scattering amplitudes can be thought of as probes of the quantum fluctuations of the dipole .",
    "the latter are best pictured with the help of the color dipole model .",

    "@xcite for an extensive discussion ) , in order to arrive at a model that leads to quantitative predictions for the scattering amplitudes .    in these matters ,",
    "useful intuition can be gained from numerical implementations of the dipole model in the form of a monte carlo event generator  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we shall illustrate our arguments with the help of simulations of the toy model constructed in ref .",
    "+ the quantum evolution of the dipole proceeds through successive independent splittings @xmath22 , with rate per unit rapidity given by the probability distribution @xmath23 , where @xmath2 is the size vector of the initial dipole , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the size vectors of the offspring , and @xmath26 .",
    "the stochastic process of dipole evolution is a _",
    "branching diffusion_. indeed , if one looks at the distribution of the log of the dipole sizes at a _ given _ impact parameter , it has a gaussian - like shape growing exponentially with the rapidity , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dipole]a .",
    "the stochasticity has a strong effect wherever the number of dipoles is of order unity , namely either in the beginning of the evolution ( for low rapidities ) , or at the edges of the distribution .",
    "elsewhere , in the bulk of the distribution , the law of large numbers applies , and therefore , the rapidity evolution of the dipole density is nearly deterministic .    according to these observations , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we conjectured that there are essentially two types of fluctuations : the `` front fluctuations '' that come from the early stages of the evolution , and the `` tip fluctuations '' occurring throughout the evolution in the regions in which the dipole density is low .",
    "both kinds of fluctuations shift the distribution of dipoles towards larger sizes , by say @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively , in logarithmic scale .",
    "we conjectured that the latter random variables are distributed exponentially , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a number determined by the eigenvalues of the bfkl kernel .",
