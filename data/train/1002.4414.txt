    "although existing observations of the large scale structure of the universe overwhelmingly favour cold dark matter cosmologies with hierarchical structure formation , the paradigm faces challenges both from the existence of luminous passive galaxies at high redshift , and the abundance of low - mass galaxies in the local universe ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "galaxies dominate the visible universe and any cosmological model is expected to reproduce the observed global properties of galaxies , at least statistically , in the first instance .",
    "a significant fraction of the evolutionary life of many galaxies is spent in the environment of small systems ( i.e. groups ) , where close interactions and mergers of galaxies occur with higher efficiency than in massive haloes such as galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the observable properties of the baryonic content of a group , which consists of the constituent galaxies and the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) , should be linked to mass assembly of the host group and its subsequent evolution . among such observable properties , the  magnitude gap  ,",
    "i.e. , the difference in the magnitudes of the two brightest galaxies , has been widely used as an optical parameter related to mass assembly of groups and clusters .",
    "several studies show that a system of galaxies , where most of the mass has been assembled very early , develops a larger magnitude gap compared to systems that form later .",
    "the idea is supported in observational samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , theoretical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in detailed analysis of n - body numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "these studies also predict that such early - formed galaxy groups or clusters should be relaxed and relatively more isolated systems in comparison to their later - formed counterparts .",
    "@xcite defined such early - formed systems ( also known as _ fossils _ ) to have a minimum x - ray luminosity of @xmath11erg s@xmath5 , and a large magnitude gap in the @xmath8-band between their first two brightest galaxies , i.e. @xmath12 , to distinguish them from late - formed groups and clusters .",
    "recent research based on the sloan digital sky survey has either used only the optical criterion @xcite or both optical and x - ray criteria @xcite to identify fossils . in the former case , if the optical definition is solely employed , the chance of identifying truly early - formed systems diminishes , since a large fraction of the systems detected might be in the stage of collapsing for the first time , and so would not be x - ray luminous .    from numerical simulations",
    ", @xcite found that @xmath13 may not be a good indicator for identifying early - formed groups , since the condition would no longer be fulfilled when a galaxy of intermediate magnitude fell into the group .",
    "this study was based on simulations of dark matter particles only , and does reveal how frequently such a situation would arise .",
    "other , potentially more robust , magnitude gap criteria have been considered in the literature .",
    "for example , @xcite finds that the difference in magnitude between the first and 10@xmath14 brightest galaxies in three fossil groups span a range of @xmath1535 , in agreement with their results from the analysis of the millennium data together with the semi - analytic catalogue of @xcite .",
    "the overall number of observed fossil galaxy groups is small , making it difficult for observed systems to be statistically compared to simulated systems . in spite of their low space density , fossils have been used to test models of cosmological evolution @xcite , since the criteria for observationally identifying such systems are simple @xcite , and it is generally assumed that they are the archetypal relaxed systems , consisting of a group - scale x - ray halo , the optical image being dominated by a giant elliptical galaxy at the core @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if they are relaxed early - formed systems , fossil groups can be the ideal systems in which to study mechanisms of feedback , and the interaction of central agn and the igm of the group , since the effect of the agn would not be complicated by the effect of recent mergers @xcite .",
    "the lack of recent merging activity would also predict the absence of current or recent star formation in early - type galaxies belonging to fossil groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the relative dearth of red star - forming galaxies compared to similar elliptical - dominated non - fossil groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "the use of cosmological simulations in the study of the evolution of galaxy groups will have to employ a semi - analytic scheme for simulating galaxies , and the results will be dependent on the appropriate characterisation of the models that describe galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "once the hierarchical buildup of dark matter haloes is computed from n - body simulations , galaxy formation is modelled by considering the rate at which gas can cool within these haloes .",
    "this involves assumptions for the rate of galaxy merging ( driven by dynamical friction ) and the rate and efficiency of star formation and the associated feedback in individual galaxies @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we studied the formation of fossil groups in the millennium simulations , and showed that the conventional definition of fossils ( namely a large magnitude gap between the two brightest galaxies within half a virial radius and a lower limit to the x - ray luminosity @xmath16erg s@xmath5 ) , results in the identification of haloes which are @xmath1710%-20% more massive than the rest of the population of galaxy groups with the same halo mass and x - ray luminosity , when the universe was half of its current age .",
    "this clearly indicates an early formation epoch for fossils .",
    "in addition , it was shown that the conventional fossil selection criteria filter out spurious systems , and therefore there is a very small probability for a large magnitude gap in a halo to occur at random .",
    "the fraction of late - formed systems that are spuriously identified as fossils was found to be @xmath1848% , almost independent of halo mass @xcite .",
    "another important outcome of the @xcite study was the consistency between the space density of fossils found in the simulations and that from observational samples .",
    "although the results from this previous analysis of the millennium simulations are shown to be in fair agreement with observation , we did not investigate the evolution of the magnitude gap in either fossil or control groups with redshift .",
    "furthermore , the number of ( fossil or control ) groups used was small ( @xmath15400 ) , which did not allow us to fully explore the connection between the halo mass and magnitude gap in such systems .    in this paper , we select early - formed galaxy groups from the millennium simulations , purely on the basis of their halo mass evolution from present time up to redshift @xmath19 , and , with the help of associated semi - analytic catalogues , study the evolution of the magnitude gap between their brightest galaxies . our aim is to ( a ) investigate how well the conventional optical selection criterion , namely the @xmath20 gap between the two brightest galaxies , is able to identify early - formed galaxy groups , and ( b ) to find whether we can find a better criterion to identify groups that have assembled most of their mass at an early epoch .    in  2",
    ", we describe the various simulation suites used in this work , and in  3 the data we extract from them . in  4 , we study in detail the evolution with epoch of various measurable parameters for a large sample of early - formed `` fossil systems '' and two comparable sample of control systems , and compare these properties . in  5 , we examine the case for a revision of the criteria to observationally find fossil in order to ensure a higher incidence of genuine early - formed systems .",
    "we summarise our conclusions in  6 .",
    "we adopt @xmath21 km  s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 for the hubble constant , with @xmath23 .",
    "the millennium run consists of a simulation , in a universe consistent with concordance @xmath24cdm cosmology , of 2160@xmath25 particles of individual mass @xmath26 m@xmath2 , within a co - moving periodic box of side 500@xmath27 mpc , employing a gravitational softening of 5@xmath27 kpc , from redshift @xmath28 to the present day @xcite .",
    "the basic setup is that of an inflationary universe , dominated by dark matter particles , leading to a bottom - up hierarchy of structure formation , which involves the collapse and merger of small dense haloes at high redshifts , into the modern - day observed large virialised systems such as groups and clusters .",
    "the cosmological parameters used by the millennium simulation were @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , and the hubble parameter @xmath34 .",
    "dark matter haloes are found in this simulation down to a resolution limit of 20 particles , yielding a minimum halo mass of 1.72@xmath35 m@xmath2 .",
    "haloes in the simulation are found using a friends - of - friends ( fof ) group finder , configured to extract haloes with overdensities of at least 200 relative to the critical density @xcite . within a fof halo , substructures or subhaloes",
    "are identified using the subfind algorithm developed by @xcite , and the treatment of the orbital decay of satellites is described in the next section .    during the millennium simulation ,",
    "64 time - slices of the locations and velocities of all the particles were stored , spread approximately logarithmically in time between @xmath28 and @xmath36 . from these time - slices ,",
    "merger trees were built by combining the tables of all haloes found at any given output epoch , thus enabling us to trace the growth of haloes and their subhaloes through time within the simulation .",
    "@xcite simulated the growth of galaxies , and their central supermassive black holes , by self - consistently implementing semi - analytic models of galaxies on the dark matter haloes of the @xcite simulation , their semi - analytic catalogue contains 9 million galaxies at @xmath36 brighter than absolute magnitude @xmath37 , `` observed '' in @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath8 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 filters .",
    "the models focus on the growth of black holes and agn as sources of feedback sources .",
    "the inclusion of agn feedback in the semi - analytic model ( allowing central cooling to be suppressed in massive haloes that undergo quasi - static cooling ) , and its good agreement with the observed galaxy luminosity function , distribution of galaxy colours and of the clustering properties of galaxies , make this catalogue suitable for our study .    in this semi - analytic formulation",
    ", galaxies initially form within small dark matter haloes .",
    "such a halo may fall into a larger halo as the simulation evolves .",
    "the `` galaxy '' within this halo then becomes a satellite galaxy within the main halo , and follows the track of its original dark matter halo ( now a subhalo ) , until the mass of the subhalo drops below 1.72@xmath42 m@xmath2 .",
    "this limit corresponds to the 20-particle limit for dark haloes in the original millennium simulation . at this point",
    "the galaxy is assumed to spiral into the centre of the halo , on some fraction of the dynamical friction timescale , where it merges with the central galaxy of the larger halo @xcite .",
    "the @xcite model also makes use of the millennium simulation , but utilises merger trees constructed with the algorithm described by @xcite .",
    "the cooling of gas and the subsequent formation of galaxies and black holes is followed through the merging hierarchy of each tree utilising the galform semi - analytic model @xcite . at @xmath36",
    "this results in 4,491,139 galaxies brighter than a limiting absolute magnitude of @xmath43 .",
    "in addition to feedback from supernovae , the @xcite model accounts for energy input from agn , resulting in a suppression of cooling in the hot atmospheres of massive haloes .",
    "the resulting galaxy population is in excellent agreement with the observed @xmath36 galaxy luminosity function in @xmath38 and @xmath41 bands , the @xmath36 colour distribution and also with the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function from @xmath36 to @xmath44 .",
    "this model is therefore similarly well - suited to our study of fossil systems .",
    "if a halo in a merger tree has multiple progenitors , all but the most massive are considered to become subhaloes orbiting within the larger host halo and any galaxies they contain therefore become satellite galaxies in that halo .",
    "due to the limited resolution of the millennium simulation ( which may cause dynamical friction timescales to be poorly estimated ) , the time between becoming a satellite and merging with the central galaxy of the halo is computed from the analytic dynamical friction timescale .",
    "specifically , each new satellite is randomly assigned orbital parameters from a distribution measured from n - body simulations and the appropriate dynamical friction timescale computed following the approach of @xcite , but multiplied by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "this was found to produce the best fit to the luminosity function in @xcite but is also in good agreement with the results of @xcite who compared the predictions of analytic dynamical friction timescales with those from idealised n - body simulations .",
    "the satellite is allowed to orbit for the period of time calculated above , after which it is merged with the central galaxy of the halo .",
    "if the host halo doubles in mass before a satellite can merge , the satellite orbit is assumed to be reset by the merging which lead to that mass growth and so a new set of orbital parameters are assigned and a new merging timescale computed .",
    "the millennium gas simulations are a series of hydrodynamical models constructed within the same volume , and values of initial perturbation amplitudes and phases , as the parent dark - matter - only millennium simulation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . of the three principal models completed in this work ,",
    "each contains additional baryonic physics : ( i ) the first does not follow the effects of radiative cooling and so overpredicts the luminosities of group - scale objects significantly , ( ii ) the second includes a simple preheating scheme that is tuned to match the observed x - ray properties of clusters at the present day and ( iii ) the third includes a simple feedback model that matches the observed properties of clusters today .",
    "we have used the second of these models in this work , as we only utilise the hydrodynamical properties of the groups at @xmath36 , where the observational and simulation results are well matched .",
    "the millennium gas simulations consist of @xmath45 particles of each species , resulting in a dark matter mass of @xmath46 m@xmath47 per particle and a gas mass of @xmath48 m@xmath47 per particle .",
    "the millennium simulation has roughly 20 times better mass resolution than this and so some perturbation of the dark matter halo locations is to be expected . in practice",
    "the position and mass of dark matter haloes above @xmath49 m@xmath47 are recovered to within @xmath50kpc between the two volumes , allowing straightforward halo - halo matching in the large majority of cases .    the millennium gas simulations used exactly the same cosmological parameters as those of the dark matter simulations . with the inclusion of a gaseous component ,",
    "additional care needs to be taken in choosing the gravitational softening length in order to avoid spurious heating @xcite .",
    "we use a comoving value of @xmath51 kpc , roughly 4% of the mean inter - particle separation @xcite until @xmath52 , above which a maximum comoving value of @xmath53 kpc is adopted .",
    "a different output strategy is followed in the millennium gas simulations , where the results are output uniformly in time with an interval roughly corresponding to the dynamical time of objects of interest .",
    "this strategy results in 160 rather than 64 outputs and places particular emphasis on the late stages of the simulation .",
    "we start with a catalogue of groups extracted by the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm employed in the millennium dark matter runs .",
    "hereafter a `` group '' or `` group halo '' would refer to a group taken from this catalogue . in order to follow the evolution of groups from @xmath541 to the present epoch",
    ", we have to combine various sets of information from this fof group catalogue and the associated semi - analytic catalogues of galaxies , as well as the gas simulations .",
    "we select all groups of @xmath55m@xmath2 from the fof group catalogue at @xmath56 .",
    "the mass cut - off is intended to ensure that the progenitors of the present day galaxy groups are indeed groups at @xmath571 with at least four or five members ( galaxies ) , above the magnitude cut of the catalogue .",
    "the evolution of each group was followed from @xmath56 to @xmath36 ( at 23 discrete values , equally spaced in @xmath58 ) by matching the position of each halo to its descendants at later redshifts .",
    "the position of the central galaxy of each galaxy group , and the corresponding dark matter halo , were used to identify the member galaxies of each group . at each redshift and for each group",
    "halo , optical properties were extracted for its corresponding galaxies from the semi - analytic galaxy catalogue .",
    "the model galaxies become incomplete below a magnitude limit of m@xmath59 , due to the limited mass resolution of the millennium simulation .",
    "we applied a @xmath41-band absolute magnitude cut - off of m@xmath60 on galaxies at all redshifts . during the matching process , for more than 99% of the groups at each redshift , corresponding galaxies were found in the semi - analytic galaxy catalogue .",
    "the remaining groups were excluded from our final compiled list .    in order to find the gas properties of all groups at @xmath61 ,",
    "we cross - correlated our list of groups with the millennium gas catalogue , and find the bolometric x - ray luminosity of our selected groups at @xmath62=0 . out of 19066",
    "dark matter group haloes with @xmath63m@xmath2 selected at @xmath56 , optical properties from the semi - analytic catalogue ( as well as gas properties from the gas simulations at @xmath62=0 ) and the entire history of evolution at all redshifts up to @xmath62=0 , were found for 17866 ( @xmath1594% of the initial sample at @xmath64 ) of group haloes .",
    "[ alifig01 ] shows the bolometric x - ray luminosity from the millennium gas simulation , plotted against the corresponding dark matter halo mass of each group , at redshift @xmath62=0 for all of the matched 17866 groups .",

    "[ alifig01 ] corresponds to the conventional x - ray luminosity threshold ( @xmath65erg s@xmath5 ) for fossil groups @xcite , as adopted in sec .",
    "[ fossil ] to define x - ray bright groups .",
    "there are 14628 groups above this threshold , out of 17866 groups .",
    "these x - ray bright groups will constitute the main data set for the rest of our analysis , except for  [ sam ] and  [ delta4 ] , where the whole range of halo mass will be explored to study the magnitude gap statistics and the local environment of groups ,",
    "the dynamical friction @xmath66 will cause the more luminous galaxies in a group to merge on a time scale which depends upon the velocity dispersion of the group , and since @xmath67 this is more frequent in poorer groups than in clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , on group scales , the likelihood of a few of the brightest galaxies merging to form the brightest galaxy , leading to a large magnitude gap within a hubble time , is higher .",
    "thus , the distribution of the magnitude gap between the brightest galaxy , and the second and third brightest galaxies , in each group , is often used as an indicator the dynamical age of group , particularly in fossil groups @xcite .",
    "we determine the magnitude gaps from the millennium semi - analytic models of @xcite and @xcite , and compare them with observational results from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) c4 cluster catalogue data of @xcite and the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) group catalogue of @xcite .",
    "the 2dfgrs group catalogue is constructed based on a halo - based group finder algorithm of @xcite and contains @xmath68 groups within the mass range @xmath69m@xmath70 where the mass of each group has been determined from the total luminosity of all group members brighter than @xmath71 .",
    "the c4 catalogue @xcite consists of @xmath72 clusters identified in the spectroscopic sample of the second data release ( dr2 ) of the sdss inside the mass range @xmath73m@xmath74 , estimated from the total @xmath75-band optical luminosity of cluster galaxies .",
    "the results of the comparison between our distribution of the estimated @xmath8-band magnitude gaps from semi - analytic models of @xcite as well as @xcite , based on the millennium simulation ( red triangles and black circles respectively ) , and the observed results from the c4 cluster catalogue and the 2dfgrs group catalogues ( blue histogram ) , are shown in fig .",
    "[ alifig02 ] .",
    "the magnitude gap statistics @xmath76 and @xmath77 from @xcite are in excellent agreement with those obtained from 2dfgrs group catalogue and sdss c4 catalogue of clusters .",
    "however , the semi - analytic galaxy catalogue of @xcite predicts a larger fraction of groups with @xmath12 for both the sdss and 2dfgrs samples .",
    "this is in particular of great importance to the determination of the space density of fossil galaxy groups , and the comparison of fossil samples drawn from simulated and observed catalogues , which use the magnitude gap as a key discriminant , ( e.g. , see table  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the shift of the distribution of @xmath76 and @xmath78 to larger values than observed in the @xcite model may reflect the fact that in the @xcite model , the treatment of dynamical friction differs from that used by @xcite . in both models ,",
    "n - body dynamics are used to follow the orbital decay of satellite galaxies whose subhalo can be resolved .",
    "however , when the subhalo can no longer be reliably followed , the dynamical friction calculations differ . in the @xcite model , the dynamical friction timescale is initially calculated following @xcite",
    ". however , if the host halo of the satellite is deemed to undergo a formation event ( corresponding to a mass doubling since the previous formation event ) , before the satellite merges , then a new orbit for the satellite is selected at random , and the dynamical friction timescale for the satellite is recalculated .",
    "this calculation takes into account the scattering of galaxies to larger energy orbits during the merger of their parent halo .",
    "another possible cause for the success of the @xcite model in matching the magnitude gap statistics is that it predicts a large scatter in the relation between galaxy stellar mass and halo mass  significantly more than in the @xcite model . as a result ,",
    "sometimes rather large satellite haloes arrive carrying relatively small galaxies resulting in a large difference between the magnitude of the dominant object and the next most luminous .",
    "this difference occurs because the agn feedback is not guaranteed to switch off the cooling at a particular halo mass in the @xcite model , as it depends on the merging and cooling history of each halo .    for the purposes of this work , the fact that the @xcite method for computing merging timescales results in good agreement with the observed magnitude gap distributions , makes it well suited for the remainder of our study .      in cosmological simulations , the age of galaxy groups",
    "can be expressed in terms of the rate of the mass assembly of the groups .",
    "this means that for a given group halo mass , groups that formed early , assemble most of their masses at an earlier epoch in comparison to younger groups .",
    "thus the _ assembly time _ of a dark matter halo , defined as the look - back time at which its main progenitor reaches a mass that is half of the halo s present day mass , is larger in `` older '' systems than in `` younger '' ones .",
    "of course , in cosmological simulations such as the millennium runs , where the structures in universe from hierarchically , massive systems which form later turn out to have shorter assembly time than low mass groups . therefore one should take into account the mass of systems when comparing the mass assembly of various types of groups and clusters .",
    "how is the history of mass assembly of a group or cluster related to its present observable parameters ?",
    "it is expected that groups which have formed earlier tend to be more dynamically relaxed , thus resulting in a hotter intergalactic medium ( igm ) and being more likely to be x - ray luminous @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in x - ray luminous systems , the brightest galaxies are bigger and more optically luminous and those belonging to systems that have little or no diffuse x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "on the other hand , groups with the same mass that have formed late , and are still in a state of collapse , would not show x - ray emission associated with their igm @xcite , and are less likely to be dominated by a massive elliptical in their cores .    hitherto the so - called _ fossil galaxy groups _",
    ", which are supposed to be canonical examples of groups that have formed early , have been identified by requiring that their x - ray luminosities exceed @xmath11erg s@xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , a fossil group needs to have , within half a virial radius of the group s centre , the second brightest galaxy to be at least 2-mag fainter than the brightest galaxy , i.e. @xmath12 . where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the luminosities of the first two brightest galaxies .",

    "our results from this study as well as those represented in @xcite show that the fraction of fossils ( and therefore their space densities ) depend on the search radius within which @xmath76 is estimated , whereas the history or mass assembly does not change that much .",
    "let us introduce the parameter @xmath84 which for an individual group is the ratio of its mass at redshift @xmath62 to its final mass at @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath85 . thus at a given redshift @xmath62 , groups with larger @xmath84 have assembled a larger fraction of their final mass by @xmath62 than groups with smaller values of @xmath84 .    in fig .",

    "three results emerge from this plot : ( i ) as is expected , on average the rate of mass growth in massive systems is higher than in low mass groups as the majority of massive groups and clusters have assembled less than 50% of their final mass at @xmath571.0 .",
    "( ii ) less massive groups ( and therefore early - formed ones ) tend to develop larger magnitude gaps in comparison to massive groups and clusters .",

    "the situation is a bit different in x - ray fossils with @xmath112m@xmath116 ( figs .",

    "since the central galaxy in a fossil group is a product of numerous mergers , many of them with luminosities close to l@xmath122 galaxies , x - ray fossils are expected to be dominated by optically luminous brightest galaxies ( bcgs ) more often than their non - fossil counterparts . here",

    "however , the difference between the luminosities of the two brightest galaxies in groups is not always reliable for the identification of fossil systems , as this quantity is vulnerable to the assimilation of a comparable galaxy into the core of the group , as a result of infall or merger with another group .",
