    ", i will concentrate on the dynamics of branes , as described by their actions @xcite .",
    "there are a number of different branes in string theory and m - theory , most conveniently characterised by their field content when seen as a field theory on the world - volume .",
    "the simplest ones , the so - called @xmath1-branes , have a scalar multiplet on the world - volume .",
    "d - branes contain a vector multiplet , coupling to string endpoints @xcite , and the m5-brane has a self - dual tensor .    as a model for the simplest branes i will treat the membrane in eleven dimensions @xcite .",
    "the action for a brane typically consists of two parts , a kinetic term proportional to the invariant volume , and a wess ",
    "zumino term specifying the minimal coupling to a @xmath4-form potential , under which the brane carries charge : s =- td^3+tc[cede - membraneaction ] @xmath5 is the membrane tension .",
    "the action ( [ cede - membraneaction ] ) looks like an action describing bosonic degrees of freedom contained in its transverse fluctuations . how do we describe a supersymmetric brane , containing an equal number of fermionic degrees of freedom ?",
    "one simple and very efficient way , in many aspects much simpler than a component approach , is to consider the dynamics to be described by the same formal action , but where the bosonic world - volume is embedded in superspace .",
    "the target superspace has coordinates @xmath6 ( the corresponding inertial indices are @xmath7 , a lorentz vector and some spinor ) , and the background fields entering the action ( [ cede - membraneaction ] ) are pullbacks from superspace to the world - volume , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the target space super - vielbein .",
    "let us now investigate what this means for the supermembrane .",
    "the eight transverse bosonic oscillations must be matched in number by eight fermionic degrees of freedom if the action is to be supersymmetric .",
    "a ( majorana ) spinor in @xmath2 has 32 components .",
    "the number is reduced by half by the equations of motion , as usual , but it is clear that an additional local symmetry is required in order to get eight physical spinor degrees of freedom .",
    "this is the so called @xmath12-symmetry , parametrised by a half spinor .",
    "@xmath12-symmetry is a local ( in terms of the location on the brane ) translation of the brane in a fermionic direction in superspace . as such ,",
    "it is generated by a superspace vector field pointing in fermionic directions only : @xmath13 , and the transformation of the coordinates is @xmath14 .",
    "pullbacks of superspace forms are transformed by the lie derivative , @xmath15 , which after a brief calculation implies that ( pullbacks are suppressed in the following ) _ c&=&i_h+di_c + _ e^a&=&d^a+i_t^a + _",
    "g_ij&=&2e_(i^ae_j)^b^t_b^b_abwhere @xmath16 is the background tensor superfield strength and @xmath17 the superspace torsion .    to determine how the action transforms ( modulo boundary terms )",
    ", we only need @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in @xmath2 supergravity @xcite this is particularly simple , the only non - vanishing components of @xmath20 and @xmath21 with at least one spinorial form - index are the dimension 0 ones , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "a short calculation yields _ s =- d^32 e_i^(^i-^ijk_jk)_^with the obvious notation for pullbacks of @xmath24-matrices . the combination of @xmath24-matrices in the last term may be written as ^i-^ijk_jk=^i(-^ijk_ijk ) = ^i(-)[cede - membranegamma ] and is seen to provide a projection on @xmath12 , since @xmath25 , due to the identities @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are projection matrices splitting a 32-component spinor in two halves . the only chance that this variation vanishes is thus that @xmath28 .",
    "this is indeed the half spinor of local fermionic symmetry that was needed for the matching of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "since setting the dimension 0 torsion to a @xmath24-matrix puts the background on shell @xcite , the supermembrane has @xmath12-symmetry in any on - shell background of @xmath2 supergravity .",
    "analogous calculations hold for other @xmath1-branes in other supergravities , and show that for general on - shell backgrounds , the actions are @xmath12-symmetric .",
    "@xmath12-symmetry is related to the fact that the branes are bps - saturated configurations ",
    "the supersymmetry algebra generating the multiplets on the branes ( in the present case a scalar multiplet ) contains half the number of fermionic generators compared to the target space supersymmetry , and half of the target space supersymmetry is broken ( the world - volume fields are goldstone fields corresponding to broken symmetries of the background ) .",
    "the projection matrices are related to ( target space ) supersymmetry algebras with `` central '' tensorial charges , that get projected out by a half - rank projection @xmath29 .",
    "we may also note that the formalism presented here , with the brane embedded in an arbitrary target superspace background , actually is as simple as in a flat superspace . working with explicit fermionic",
    "coordinates becomes complicated , since the expression for a tensor potential is complicated , while the ( gauge invariant ) field strength is simple .",
    "as presented here , the branes are viewed as infinitely thin objects moving in superspace .",
    "they may also be seen as solitons in the low - energy effective supergravity theories @xcite .",
    "all fields on branes arise as goldstone modes corresponding to broken symmetries of the background theory .",
    "scalars and fermions correspond to broken translational symmetries and supersymmetry , while vectors on d - branes and tensors on m5-branes arise as goldstone modes for large gauge symmetries of target space tensors , , gauge transformations that take different values `` on the brane '' and in the asymptotic region @xcite .      the @xmath24-matrix constraint on the dimension 0 torsion puts the theory on shell @xcite .",
    "the tensor field arises naturally from the superspace geometry , and it is not necessary to separately require the existence of a closed 4-form on superspace .",
    "the bianchi identity for @xmath20 at dimension 0 becomes @xmath30 , which is fulfilled due to a fierz identity in eleven dimensions , and at dimension 1 , the non - vanishing torsion is t_a^=^bcd_^h_abcd + _ a^bcde_^h_bcdeactually , the superspace bianchi identities also leave room for a spinor @xmath31 at dimension @xmath32 and a vector @xmath33 at dimension 1 in @xmath5 , the bianchi identities further require that these be integrable to @xmath34 , and the `` conformal compensator '' @xmath35 can then be removed by a conventional constraint , or alternatively by the enlargement of the structure group to include weyl rescalings .",

    "a the potentials have odd rank , @xmath36 , and for type b even , @xmath37 .",

    "the field @xmath35 is the dilaton field , and the factor @xmath39 means that the d - brane tension in the `` string frame '' is proportional to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the string coupling . in the second line , the action has been rewritten in terms of the einstein metric @xmath42 , which is sometimes convenient , especially when i later want to consider sl(2;@xmath43 ) duality symmetry . the second , wess ",

    "type b supergravity has an sl(2;@xmath65 ) symmetry , which at the quantum level is broken to the sl(2;@xmath43 ) s - duality group . since s - duality is non - perturbative , the representations under sl(2;@xmath43 ) contain perturbative and non - perturbative states , and can not be manifested in perturbative string theory",
    "nevertheless , it can be manifested in the effective supergravity , and it is meaningful to ask whether it is possible to treat all branes with ns - ns and rr charges , including the fundamental string , on an equal footing , thus manifesting the s - duality symmetry .",
    "the scalars , the dilaton and axion , belong to the coset sl(2;@xmath65)/u(1 ) .",

    "the representations of branes reflect those of the tensor fields : the strings and five - branes come with charges that form an sl(2;@xmath43 ) doublet @xmath69 , while the d3-brane forms a singlet .",

    "the singlet 5-form is constructed as @xmath80 , with bianchi identity @xmath81 .",
    "we now come to the crucial point in describing brane dynamics sl(2)-covariantly .",
    "it is not sufficient to introduce one vector field on the brane .",
    "remember that the field strength was @xmath47 , where @xmath38 was the ns - ns 2-form .",
    "it is clear that another vector , combining with the rr 2-form is needed , so that they form a doublet .",
    "one should thus have @xmath82 , reflecting the fact that strings of different charges @xmath69 can end on a brane .",
    "once this step has been taken , it is equally natural to introduce a form of rank @xmath1 for each background tensor fields of rank @xmath83 , reflecting the fact that a @xmath1-brane can end on the brane we describe , and coupling minimally to its boundary . for this reason , such a formulation , with complete `` tensor democracy '' on the branes , should most naturally encode the coupling of branes to background fields .",

    "the key is selfduality , and i will sketch how it works for different branes .",

    "@xcite for details .",
    "all cases described may be shown to be @xmath12-symmetric , along similar lines as in the previous sections .",
    "the actions do not divide into born  infeld plus wess  zumino , since this presumes a division into ns - ns and rr fields .",
    "[ [ the - pq - strings ] ] the @xmath69 strings + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the vectors @xmath84 have no local degrees of freedom on the two - dimensional world - sheet , so we do not have to worry about removing degrees of freedom .",
    "the only degrees of freedom of vectors is a quantised electric flux ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for one vector ) , so the description gives rise to a pair of integers @xmath69 , which are the charges of string .",
    "in this way , the whole spectrum of @xmath69 strings is described within one single action @xcite . that the description is correct is checked by @xmath12-symmetry and by the fact that the correct tensions @xcite are produced .",
    "[ [ the-3-brane ] ] the 3-brane + + + + + + + + + + +    having two vector potentials gives too many degrees of freedom , and one of them has effectively to be removed .",
    "this is obtained by imposing a selfduality relation on the complex field strength @xmath85 : @xmath86 + higher order terms .",
    "it turns out that not any non - linear selfduality relation is allowed .",
    "its exact form is dictated by consistency with the coupling to the background fields , and also , independently , by @xmath12-symmetry , and it encodes in a manifest way the earlier observed poincar selfduality of the 3-brane .",
    "a formulation of the dynamics of the type b 3-brane is obtained @xcite that naturally encodes in a most symmetric way all couplings to background fields , and thereby the possibilities for the 3-brane to host brane boundaries @xcite .",

    "there is a duality relation between the 4-form and the 2-forms .",
    "the fact that the corresponding supergravity solution could be described analytically @xcite makes it reasonable to believe that the dynamics can be described covariantly , in spite of problems with dualisation in six dimensions @xcite .",

    "it is also applicable to type a branes , and will also there encode the background interactions in the most natural way .",
    "i have described brane dynamics by embedding in superspace , given a detailed account of the mechanisms behind @xmath12-symmetry and focussed on the couplings of branes to fields in the background effective supergravity .",

    "some @xmath0-corrections to the brane actions themselves are also known @xcite .",
    "what happens to the brane dynamics when @xmath0 corrections are turned in in target space ?",
    "it is clear that a superspace formulation is desirable in order to answer such questions . in the following lecture",
    "i will describe some recent progress in the superspace formulations of @xmath2 supergravity and @xmath87 super - yang ",
    "mills theory , both relevant for string / m - theory .",
    "we will now continue the discussion of the superspace formulation of eleven - dimensional supergravity in superspace @xcite .",
    "the vielbeins are @xmath88 , and the resulting torsion 2-form is @xmath89 , where the structure group is the lorentz group , , the spin connection satisfies @xmath90 .",
    "the curvature is @xmath91 .",
    "the bianchi identities for torsion and curvature are @xmath92 and @xmath93 . of these",
    ", one needs only to use the first one .    as long as torsion and curvature",
    "are constructed from vielbeins and spin connections , the bianchi identities are automatically fulfilled . in order to reduce the enormous amount of fields contained in these , one has however to impose `` conventional constraints '' connecting the different components .",
    "then the bianchi identities become integrability conditions that have to be checked , and which imply the equations of motion ( this is true for the maximally supersymmetric theories i deal with in this lecture ) .",
    "the conventional constraints are of two types .",
    "the first one uses the freedom in the definition of the torsion to shift it into the spin connection when possible .",
    "these constraints do not eliminate all of the torsion ( as it does in bosonic gravity ) , but have the effect of determining the spin connection if terms of the vielbein , which is desirable .",
    "the second type uses a redefinition of the tangent bundle , @xmath94 , while keeping the spin connection , and thus the curvature , invariant ( although their components vary due to the change of basis ) .",
    "we want to use this freedom to the extent that it enables us to express all vielbein components in terms of the dimension @xmath95 one , @xmath96 .",
    "let us now examine the lowest - dimensional torsion components , @xmath97 at dimension 0 .",
    "i already mentioned that putting it equal to a @xmath24-matrix takes the theory on - shell , so in order to incorporate corrections to the ordinary supergravity this constraint ( which is not a conventional constraint ) has to be modified . a general expansion yields , since the torsion is symmetric in the spinor indices , t_^c=2(_^dx_d^c + _ ^d_1d_2x_d_1d_2^c + _ ^d_1  d_5x_d_1  d_5^c ) decomposing into irreducible representations of the lorentz group , we find that the three `` x - tensors '' contain @xmath98 . where standard dynkin labels for highest weights are used .",
    "if this representation content is compared to the one in the dimension-0 matrices for redefining the vielbein , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , which is @xmath101 , we see that the only remaining components are @xmath102 and @xmath103 , , the `` irreducible hooks '' @xcite .",
    "these superfields should encode which the corrections to the supergravity are , and the equations of motion for any version of @xmath2 supergravity should follow from the solution of the bianchi identities with a suitable choice of these tensors .",
    "this will be even clearer when we consider spinorial cohomology in a little while .    solving the bianchi identities turns out to be quite complicated , and we have not succeeded in doing it in full generality . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we were able to show that the gravitino equation of motion received a correction , by solving the bianchi identities up to dimension @xmath104 , encountering on the way some remarkable numerical coincidences .",

    "the operator @xmath138 : @xmath139 can schematically be written as @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the exterior covariant derivative @xmath142 and @xmath143 is the algebraic projection from @xmath144 to @xmath145 .",
    "it is straightforward to write an explicit tensorial form for @xmath128 by subtracting @xmath24-traces from @xmath146 , but it will not be used here .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that , for an abelian gauge group and standard flat superspace , the sequence ( [ cede - complex ] ) forms a complex , , that @xmath147 .",
    "this follows simply from the fact that while @xmath148 , the torsion only has a component @xmath149 which is projected out by @xmath143 .",
    "this means that for non - abelian gauge theory the complex should be considered in a flat background , and the deformations yielded are infinitesimal .",
    "we would now like to calculate the cohomology @xmath150 of the complex associated with @xmath87 super - yang  mills .",
    "this can be done by considering the decomposition into irreducible representations of the representation sitting at level @xmath151 in @xmath152 , @xmath153 .",
    "this is easily done ,  with the help of the program lie @xcite .",
    "one then follows each of the irreducible representations at a given dimension through the subcomplex @xmath154    let me illustrate the calculation by examining the field content .",
    "we then look into the spinor potential of dimension @xmath32 , which contains all fields in the vector multiplet , so we should examine the first cohomology .",
    "the vector ( dimension 1 ) sits at @xmath155 and the spinor ( dimension @xmath104 ) at @xmath156 .",
    "the subcomplexes under consideration are @xmath157 and @xmath158 . checking the multiplicities of the relevant representations , ( 10000 ) and ( 00001 ) , in these , we obtain the sequences @xmath159 and @xmath160 . the components of the cohomology in these representations and dimensions clearly contain the physical fields . this can be understood in a traditional framework as removing degrees of freedom in a superfield gauge transformation ( removing the image from the left ) and imposing the vanishing of the field strength @xmath161 ( removing the complement of the kernel from the right ) .",
    "analogous considerations tell us that the second cohomology contains a spinor of dimension @xmath162 and a vector of dimension @xmath163 .",
    "these are interpreted as belonging to a current supermultiplet , , fields entering the right hand sides of the equations of motion .",
    "this goes well together with the observation that modifications of the theory are introduced by deforming the constraint @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "the relevance of the cohomology is explained by the facts that deformations introduced by relaxing @xmath108 have to fulfill the bianchi identity ( removing the complement of the kernel from the right ) , and that relevant deformations are counted modulo field redefinitions ( removing the image from the left ) .",
    "see also the following section for a fuller discussion .",
    "a complete calculation of the cohomology requires that one considers all irreducible representations occurring at arbitrary levels .",
    "this quickly becomes untractable to do by hand .",
    "the method for calculating cohomologies is by using the program lie @xcite .",
    "the method will be presented in detail in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "the complete cohomology consists of ^0=(00000)_0 & & + ^1=(10000)_1(00001)_3/2 & & + ^2=(00010)_5/2(10000)_3 & & + ^3=(00000)_4 & & where the subscript indicates dimension .",
    "similar cohomologies may be calculated for the @xmath2 supergravity @xcite , and they confirm in a nice way the conclusions presented earlier in this lecture .",
    "an interesting observation is that one can choose either to consider the vielbein or the 3-form , and in either case are all the fields and deformations of the supergravity contained .",
    "it looks as though a superspace 3-form potential automatically contains gravitational degrees of freedom , although it is difficult to envisage how the dynamics should be formulated without reference to geometry .",
    "i would like to sketch how the superspace methods already described are used to derive @xmath0-corrections to @xmath87 super - yang  mills .",
    "the method for @xmath2 supergravity is in principle analogous , but much more complicated .",
    "so far , the corrections allowed by supersymmetry have been determined up to order @xmath165 @xcite , and although the level of technical complexity is high , it seems reasonable to continue one or two levels .",
    "we need to specify what @xmath117 is in terms of the fundamental superfields @xmath46 and @xmath166 .",
    "we first observe that there are no corrections at order @xmath0 .",
    "for dimensional reasons , @xmath161 has to be proportional to @xmath167 , which does not contain the representation ( 00020 ) . then , starting at order @xmath165 , there are two types of possible terms , modulo the lowest order field equations ( @xmath168 are adjoint gauge group indices , not to be confused with @xmath7 used earlier ) : j^a_abcde&=&-^2 m^a_bcd(^b^f_abcde^g^c)f^d_fg + & & + 6^2 n^a_bc(d_[a^b_bcdd_e]^c- ) [ cede - jinfields ] these satisfy the ( 00030 ) constraint at linear order , which is easily seen by acting with a spinor derivative and perform tensor multiplication of the representations of the fields . here ,",
    "@xmath169 and @xmath170 are some invariant tensors carrying adjoint indices of the gauge group .",
    "not all deformations in ( 00020 ) are relevant , as explained in the previous section .",
    "those that are in the image of @xmath171 correspond to field redefinitions of @xmath110 and are trivial .",
    "a careful examination of field redefinitions shows that only the first term in eq .",
    "( [ cede - jinfields ] ) is relevant , and the other can be discarded .",
    "in addition , @xmath172 can be taken to be completely symmetric in adjoint indices .",
    "a lengthy calculation gives the deformed equations of motion at order @xmath165 by acting with spinor derivatives on @xmath117 , and inserting in eq .",
    "( [ cede - deformedeom ] ) .",
    "these may subsequently be integrated to a component action , which reads &=&-4g^aijg^a_ij+^a^a + & & -6^2m_abcd + o(^3)the spinor @xmath166 has been replaced by @xmath173 and @xmath46 by @xmath174 , since there is a field redefinition involved in reaching this final form .",
    "it agrees with previous work @xcite on previously known terms ( up to quadratic in fermions ) .    with only a minor further restriction on @xmath169 ,",
    "the action has a second non - linearly realised supersymmetry when the gauge group has a u(1 ) factor , as is the case when one considers field theory on multiple branes .",
    "the `` symmetrised trace prescription '' of tseytlin @xcite is consistent with our results , but supersymmetry does not completely specify it , even at the @xmath164 level .",
    "it will of course be interesting to continue the analysis to higher orders .",
    "the ( 00030 ) bianchi identity will necessarily lead to corrections at order @xmath175 and higher , and a complete action will be non - polynomial .",
    "it it is not clear whether any closed , born  infeld - like form exists .",
    "it is even not known if new `` invariants '' arise that start at higher orders , or if everything follows uniquely once the @xmath165 correction is determined .",
    "the properties of the maximally supersymmetric field theories we have considered have been turned into a tool for studying restrictions imposed by supersymmetry on self - interactions .",
    "much more is to be done , both for super - yang  mills and supergravity , but it will be necessary to use computer programs ,  lie @xcite and the mathematica package gamma @xcite , to a higher degree .    a question which so - far remains unaddressed is what happens to branes moving in backgrounds with @xmath0-corrections from string / m - theory . to investigate",
    "this one will need more informations about @xmath0-corrected supergravity .",
    "will the actions still be formally the same , and the dynamics only change through the coupling to background fields ?",
    "i would tend to answer in the positive , although nothing is known .",
    "one difficulty immediately presents itself , namely that the tensor field strengths will take non - zero values even for the components of negative dimension @xcite .",
    "since @xmath12-symmetry relies on cancellations of contributions from the kinetic and wz terms , the resulting variations would have no contribution from the torsion to cancel against .",
    "one possibility is that also the condition that @xmath12 is purely spinorial is modified .",
    "one preliminary investigation would consist of checking @xmath12-symmetry for supersymmetric wilson loops @xcite in a deformed super - yang ",
