    "the importance of aggregation functions is made apparent by their wide use , not only in pure mathematics ( e.g. , in the theory of functional equations , measure and integration theory ) , but also in several applied fields such as operations research , computer and information sciences , economics and social sciences , as well as in other experimental areas of physics and natural sciences . for general background , see  @xcite and for a recent reference , see  @xcite .    in many applications ,",
    "the values to be aggregated are first to be transformed by mappings @xmath3 , @xmath4 , so that the transformed values ( which are usually real numbers ) can be aggregated in a meaningful way by a function @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting composed function @xmath6 is then defined by @xmath7 such an aggregation model is used for instance in multicriteria decision making where the criteria are not commensurate . here each @xmath2 is a local utility function , i.e. , order - preserving mapping , and the resulting function @xmath8 is referred to as an overall utility function ( also called global preference function ) . for general background",
    "see @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider this aggregation model in a purely ordinal decision setting , where @xmath9 and each @xmath10 are bounded chains @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and where @xmath13 is a sugeno integral ( see @xcite ) or , more generally , a lattice polynomial function .",
    "we refer to the resulting compositions as pseudo - sugeno integrals and pseudo - polynomial functions , respectively .",
    "the particular case when each @xmath12 is the same chain @xmath14 , and each @xmath2 is the same mapping @xmath15 , was studied in @xcite where the corresponding compositions @xmath16 were called quasi - sugeno integrals and quasi - polynomial functions . such mappings were characterized as solutions of certain functional equations and in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions which have natural interpretations in decision making and aggregation theory .    here , we take a similar approach and study pseudo - sugeno integrals from an axiomatic point of view , and seek necessary and sufficient conditions for a given function to be factorizable as a composition of a sugeno integral with unary maps .",
    "the importance of such an axiomatization is attested by the fact that this framework subsumes the sugeno utility model . since overall utility functions ( [ eq : overpreffun ] ) where @xmath17 is a sugeno integral ,",
    "coincide exactly with order - preserving pseudo - sugeno integrals ( see corollary  [ cor suf = op psi ] ) , we are particularly interested in the case when the inner mappings @xmath2 are local utility functions .    as mentioned , this aggregation model is deeply rooted in multicriteria decision making , where the variables @xmath18 represent different properties of the alternatives ( e.g. , price , speed , safety , comfort level of a car ) , and the overall utility function assigns a score to the alternatives that helps the decision maker to choose the best one ( e.g. , to choose the car to buy ) .",
    "a similar situation is that of subjective evaluation ( see @xcite ) : @xmath19 outputs the overall rating of a certain product by customers , and the variables @xmath18 represent the various properties of that product .",
    "the way in which these properties influence the overall rating can give information about the attitude of the customers .",
    "a factorization of the ( empirically ) given overall utility function @xmath19 in the form ( [ eq : overpreffun ] ) can be used for such an analysis ; this is our main motivation to also address this problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we recall the basic definitions and terminology , as well as the necessary results concerning polynomial functions ( and , in particular , sugeno integrals ) used in the sequel . in section  [ sec:3 ] ,",
    "we focus on pseudo - sugeno integrals as a tool to study certain overall utility functions .",
    "we introduce the notion of pseudo - polynomial function in subsection  [ pseudo ] and show that , even though seemingly more general , it can be equivalently defined in terms of sugeno integrals .",
    "an axiomatization of this class of generalized polynomial functions is given in subsection  [ carpseudo ] .",
    "sugeno utility functions are introduced in subsection  [ overall ] , as certain order - preserving pseudo - sugeno integrals , and then characterized in subsection  [ overall2 ] by means of necessary and sufficient conditions which extend well - known properties in aggregation function theory . within this general setting for studying sugeno utility functions , it is natural to consider the inverse problem which asks for factorizations of a sugeno utility function as a composition of a sugeno integral with local utility functions .",
    "this question is addressed in section  [ sect construction ] , where an algorithmic procedure is provided for constructing these factorizations of sugeno utility functions .",
    "we present the algorithm in subsection  [ subsect algo ] , which is illustrated by a concrete example in subsection  [ subsect example ] , and in subsection  [ subsect correct ] we show that this procedure does indeed produce the desired factorizations .",
