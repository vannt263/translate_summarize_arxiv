    "( [ eq : mod - wt ] ) ) derived in chapter  [ chap : ultrasoft ] by setting @xmath426 and differentiating with respect to @xmath435 .",
    "the wt identity implies that the vertex correction is not negligible because the identity relates the vertex correction to the fermion self - energy , which is much larger than the inverse of the free fermion propagator with an ultrasoft momentum . in the yukawa model ,",
    "the wt identity associated with gauge symmetries is absent from the outset , so the smallness of the vertex correction is not in contradiction with any identity .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : qed - wt ] ) can be derived from the conservation law of the induced current , @xmath453 by differentiating eq .",
    "( [ eq : conservationlaw ] ) with respect to @xmath454 , we obtain @xmath455 here @xmath456 is the delta function defined along the contour @xmath357 . by multiplying this equation by @xmath457 , we get @xmath458 here we have set @xmath459 , @xmath460 and neglected the sub - leading terms .",
    "the first term in the left - hand side has the same order of magnitude as the hard fermion self - energy @xmath461 times @xmath462 , so that term is negligible .",

    "the right - hand side becomes @xmath464 we see that the first term in the last line is negligible because of the on - shell condition .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath465 if we remember that @xmath466 .",
    "this equation is nothing but eq .",
    "( [ eq : qed - wt ] ) .      in this chapter , we derived the linearized off - diagonal boltzmann equation for the ultrasoft fermion average field in the kadanoff - baym formalism , and showed that the resultant equation is equivalent to the self - consistent equation in the resummed perturbation theory at the leading order of the perturbative expansion , while it has been known that the vlasov equation is equivalent to the basic equation of the htl approximation .",
    "this equivalence shows that the resummation scheme of that perturbation theory contains the interaction effect among the particles beyond the mean field approximation .",
    "we note that the off - diagonal boltzmann equation contains not only the collision term but also the thermal mass terms and the off - diagonal self - energy term , in contrast to the usual boltzmann equation .",
    "we also derived the equation which determines the @xmath4-point functions with external lines for a pair of fermions and @xmath5 bosons with ultrasoft momenta , by considering the non - linear response regime using the gauge symmetry .",
    "we also derived the ward - takahashi identity from the conservation law of the electromagnetic current in the kadanoff - baym formalism .",
    "in this thesis , we developed the resummed perturbation theory which takes into account the separation of the scale and enables us to successfully regularize the infrared singularity . by using that method",
    ", we analyzed the spectral properties of the ultrasoft fermion , including its existence itself , in the yukawa model and qed / qcd .",
    "the procedure of that method consists of the resummation of the asymptotic thermal masses . in qed / qcd , the summation of the ladder diagrams is also necessary . as a result of the analysis , we established the existence of the novel fermionic mode in that energy region , and obtain the expressions of the pole position and the residue of that mode , which are summarized in table .",
    "[ tab : ultrasoft - expression ] .",
    "we also showed that the resultant fermion propagator and the vertex function satisfy the ward - takahashi identity in qed / qcd .",
    "we also derived the linearized and generalized boltzmann equation for ultrasoft fermion excitations , which describe the time - evolution of the amplitude of the process of changing the fermion to the boson , from the kadanoff - baym equation in a yukawa model and qed .",
    "we showed that this equation is equivalent to the self - consistent equation in the resummed perturbation theory used in the analysis of the ultrasoft fermion spectrum at the leading order .",
    "it helps us to establish the foundation of the resummed perturbation theory .",
    "we derived the ward - takahashi identity from the conservation law of the electromagnetic current in qed .",
    "furthermore , we derived the equation that determines the @xmath4-point function with external lines for a pair of fermions and @xmath5 bosons with ultrasoft momenta in qed , by using @xmath380 gauge symmetry .",
    "we analyzed the finite temperature and zero chemical potential ( @xmath36 ) case in this thesis , so it is quite natural to ask how our result on the ultrasoft fermion mode is modified in other region .",
    "such analysis is already done by the author and his collaborator  @xcite , and we hope to report its results elsewhere .",
    "we just describe the analysis we performed and its results in the following : we constructed the resummed perturbation theory in high-@xmath36 and @xmath183 case , and analyzed the fermion spectrum with the ultrasoft momentum ( @xmath467 ) in the yukawa model . as a result , we found that the ultrasoft fermion mode does not exist in this case .",
    "this result is consistent with the absence of the charge symmetry in high-@xmath36 case , because the charge symmetry is essentially important for generating the ultrasoft fermion mode , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ ssc : intro - ultrasoft ] .",
    "we also investigate how large @xmath36 kills the ultrasoft fermion mode , and found that the maximum chemical potential in which the mode persists is of order @xmath0 .    the resummed perturbation scheme used in this thesis",
    "can be applied to other quantities in the low energy region , in general multi - component system .",
    "we briefly discuss some examples in the following :    * as we wrote in chapter  [ chap : intro ] , the computation of the transport coefficient also needs taking into account the interaction effect among the hard particles .",
    "usually , only the collision effect need to be resummed .",
    "however , our analysis in this thesis suggests that the difference of the dispersion relations of the particles also needs to be taken into account , when two kinds of particle appear in the loop integral .",
    "it is the case in the computation of the flavor diffusion constant  @xcite : the quarks with different flavor appear in the integral .",
    "since the current quark masses are different in each flavor , it is quite interesting to investigate the effect of the difference of the current quark mass by performing the analysis which takes into account the current quark mass . *",
    "the perturbative analysis of the neutrino spectrum   around the critical temperature of the electroweak transition , which is expected to be realized at the early universe , needs the resummation used in this thesis since the bare masses of the weak bosons becomes negligible compared with the temperature .",
    "it is an interesting task to perform such analysis , and investigate the effect of the fermion spectrum in the ultrasoft region , on the properties of the early universe . *",
    "another example is the supersymmetric system in both of the relativistic and nonrelativistic system .",
    "in such system , the susy is spontaneously broken by the finite temperature / density effect  @xcite , and as a result , the fermionic zero mode , goldstino , appears  . as is described in sec .",
    "[ ssc : intro - ultrasoft ] , the analysis of the goldstino , which uses the resummation scheme , was performed in relativistic system  .",
    "+ though the susy has not been observed as a fundamental symmetry in the real world , it was suggested to simulate the supersymmetric system using the cold atom system  , which is nonrelativistic .",
    "such system also needs the resummation scheme  @xcite , and it may be surprising since the power counting rule in the nonrelativistic system is different from that in the relativistic system .",
    "we note that , however , there is an important difference between the relativistic system and the nonrelativistic one : since the energy - momentum tensor and the supercurrent are not in the same supermultiplet in the nonrelativistic system , the goldstino can not be interpreted as the phonino .",
    "the dynamical analysis on the goldstino in the nonrelativistic system was performed  @xcite , but without the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "the analysis in the system with bec is quite attractive task .",

    "( [ eq : qed - coulomb - result - k ] ) , in qed in this appendix . showing that equation can be obtained also in the temporal gauge suffices to show that the expression of the properties of the ultrasoft fermion mode obtained in the coulomb gauge do not change in the temporal gauge , because that equation is equivalent to the self - consistent equation in the resummed perturbation theory , which was used to analyze the ultrasoft fermion mode .",

    "<S> at so high temperature ( @xmath0 ) that the coupling constant ( @xmath1 ) is small and the masses of the particles are negligible , different scheme has to be applied in each energy scale in the analysis of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in the soft energy region ( @xmath2 ) , the simple perturbative expansion called the hard thermal loop ( htl ) approximation can be applied , and that approximation expects the existence of the bosonic and fermionic collective excitations called plasmon and plasmino . on the other hand , in the ultrasoft energy region ( @xmath3 ) , the htl approximation is inapplicable due to infrared singularity , so the question whether there are any excitation modes in that energy region has not been studied well .    in this thesis </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the quark spectrum whose energy is ultrasoft in qgp , using the resummed perturbation theory which enables us to successfully regularize the infrared singularity . since the yukawa model and qed are simpler than qcd but have some similarity to qcd , we also work in these models . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we establish the existence of a novel fermionic mode in the ultrasoft energy region , and obtain the expressions of the pole position and the strength of that mode . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the ward - takahashi identity is satisfied in the resummed perturbation theory in qed / qcd .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we derive the linearized and generalized boltzmann equation for the ultrasoft fermion excitations in the kadanoff - baym formalism , and show that the resultant equation is equivalent to the self - consistent equation in the resummed perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive the equation which determines the @xmath4-point functions with external lines for a pair of fermions and @xmath5 bosons with ultrasoft momenta , by considering the non - linear response regime using the gauge symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive the ward - takahashi identity from the conservation law of the electromagnetic current in the kadanoff - baym formalism . </S>"
