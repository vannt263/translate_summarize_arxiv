    "clusters and groups of galaxies are composed of galaxies , hot x - ray emitting gas , and a gravitationally dominant dark halo .",
    "although this basic picture is well - understood , there remain a number of puzzles that prevent clusters from being fully used as standard candles .",
    "for example , simple scaling relations ( and detailed simulations ) predict that the bolometric x - ray luminosity should scale with the temperature of the gas according to @xmath0 , while observations indicate @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "early on it was suggested that groups might have a lower baryon fraction because of more efficient star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but later thinking has focussed on the idea of additional heating of the gas , often assumed to be from supernovae or active galactic nuclei ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this non - gravitational heating would decrease the central density and , because the x - ray emissivity is proportional to the density squared , reduce the luminosity . because of the lower pressures in smaller clusters and groups , this would preferentially affect them , steepening the @xmath2 relation @xcite .",
    "this viewpoint was strengthened by the discovery of an apparent entropy `` floor '' in the centers of groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the idea of a source of heat which raises the entropy of the gas to a fixed , minimum level ; smaller clusters have lower entropies and so are more affected than large clusters .",
    "this model has been developed in some detail in a number of papers @xcite and appears to be capable of naturally explaining the observations .",
    "the amount of heating required is substantial .",
    "although estimates vary , it seems likely that about 1 kev per particle is needed @xcite , an amount which may be challenging to explain from supernova heating alone @xcite .",
    "another difficulty is that observations of the ly@xmath3 forest indicate a much lower temperature for the majority of the intergalactic medium at @xmath4 @xcite , a condition which may extend to even lower redshift @xcite .",
    "although hardly conclusive , these concerns may be pointing toward another explanation for the observations .",
    "this paper argues that cooling and the resultant galaxy formation are sufficient , by themselves , to explain all of these observations and that substantial heating is not required .",
    "we draw mostly on two simple ideas : ( 1 ) small clusters and groups have converted more of their baryonic gas into galaxies than have large clusters and ( 2 ) the gas which goes to form the galaxies is preferentially lower in entropy , thus raising the mean entropy of the gas which remains .",
    "this means that not only do small clusters have a smaller gas fraction ( @xmath5 ) , the gas which is there has a higher entropy  and lower density  than it would in simple self - similar scaling models .",
    "because of the density - squared nature of the x - ray emission , this substantially diminishes the luminosity of groups and small clusters , resulting in a steeper @xmath2 relation , as observed .",
    "the effective entropy increase is most noticeable in the center of the cluster , which is just where the entropy floor is observed . in what follows ,",
    "we explore a simple model to investigate if this hypothesis can match the observations quantitatively .",
    "we will also show that there is some empirical support for the first assumption .",
    "the model described here is built on the assumption that galaxy formation is not uniformly efficient in all environments . since theoretical arguments can and have been made both ways , we attempt to address this point with observations drawn from the literature .",
    "we searched the literature and found three studies that computed stellar , gas and total masses within the same radius ( many more computed a subset of these three quantities but we only used those that computed all of the quantities to insure self - consistency ) .",
    "mulchaey et al.(1996 ) used their own rosat and optical observations combined with other results from the literature to compile a list of 16 groups with masses computed out to @xmath6 , the maximum radius at which x - ray emission could be observed .",
    "hwang et al.(1999 ) used asca observations of five intermediate mass systems and also computed masses out to @xmath6 .",
    "finally , cirimele et al.(1997 ) studied 12 abell clusters with rosat , and tabulate masses computed out to 1.5 mpc ( which is close to @xmath6 for their clusters ) .",
    "all studies used similar , although not identical , stellar mass to light ratios ( corrected for morphological variations ) and all used the same cosmological parameters .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mratio ] , we plot the relative stellar and gas masses from these three studies .",
    "this shows that the hot gas component dominates over galaxies in the most massive clusters of galaxies . for smaller systems ,",
    "the scatter increases significantly ; however , there is a trend towards an increasing stellar contribution and decreasing gas contribution for lower mass clusters and groups . to make this clearer",
    ", we divide the sample into four equal - sized groups , ordered by temperature , and plot the median for each group .",
    "to check the statistical strength of the trend , we divided the sample into two groups ( those with temperatures below and above 2 kev ) , and separately computed the median galaxy mass ratios .",
    "then , using median statistics ( e.g. gott et al.2000 ) , we find the probability that the median of the high temperature group is smaller than that of the low temperature group to be 0.986 .",
    "the gas mass ratio trend was even more significant .",
    "= 3.5 in    the most straightforward explanation of the trend in figure  [ fig : mratio ] is that the efficiency of galaxy formation varies from groups to clusters .",
    "this is the hypothesis that we will examine in this paper , but there are certainly other explanations .",
    "for example , it is possible that the relative mix of gas and stars changes outside of the measured region ( i.e. @xmath7 ) , which is generally a smaller fraction of the virial radius for groups than for clusters . moreover , it is difficult to be conclusive for a heterogeneous sample of this sort , since the groups and clusters were examined by different authors using slightly different methods .",
    "however , all of the studies did use the same basic methodology , and adopted similar parameters .",
    "also , the trend itself does not depend on correctly determining the total mass , since the ratio @xmath8  which is independent of total mass  also decreases with temperature .",
    "there are a number of other pieces of evidence which support this basic conclusion .",
    "for example , arnaud & evrard ( 1999 ) and mohr , matheison & evrard ( 1999 ) find a trend of decreasing hot gas fraction with decreasing temperature for their samples . this pattern has sometimes been taken to imply that gas has been ejected from smaller clusters and groups , despite the large amount of energy required to do this .",
    "however , it seems equally possible that this gas is in the form of stars .",
    "this would also be consistent with a higher mass - to - light ratio for large clusters than for groups @xcite , although see @xcite .",
    "weak lensing of groups should provide useful constraints ; preliminary results indicate the the mass - to - light ratios of groups are somewhat lower than clusters @xcite .",
    "finally , constraints from galaxy clustering indicates the number of galaxies in a halo must grow more slowly then the mass of the halo @xcite , consistent with the trend presented here . despite this circumstantial evidence",
    ", we can not prove that the efficiency of galaxy formation depends on environment ; all we can do is show that the available data are consistent with the trend shown in figure  1 . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we will assume this to be true and examine the consequences that follow .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mratio ] , we show the relation , @xmath9 which we will take to be the stellar mass fraction in this paper , and is the result of minimizing the absolute deviation of the mass ratio .",
    "the gas fraction is simply @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is compatible with the cosmological model we have chosen .",
    "specifically , this is a flat model with ( @xmath12,@xmath13,@xmath14 ) = ( 0.35,0.056,0.65 ) , where @xmath12 is the ratio of the mass density to the critical density and @xmath14 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km / s / mpc .",
    "the results are most sensitive to the value of the hubble constant since the ratio of stellar to gas mass varies as @xmath15 ; the other parameters play almost no role .    in order to build a concrete model for the structure of a group or cluster of galaxies",
    "we assume that : ( 1 ) the clusters are spherically symmetric and in hydrostatic equilibrium ; ( 2 ) the hot gas and stellar fractions are as given above ; ( 3 ) the gas which is converted into stars comes from the lowest entropy gas in the cluster and all other fluid elements lie on the same adiabat they would have without cooling or star formation . from experience gained with numerical simulations , we know that while clusters are not in exact hydrostatic equilibrium this assumption is a reasonable approximation .",
    "the second assumption has some empirical basis , as previously discussed .",
    "we will return to a discussion of the last assumption .    to create a cluster of a given mass @xmath16",
    ", we assume the dark matter density is described by @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the critical density , @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a concentration parameter that depends weakly on mass in the range of interest .",
    "we take @xmath21 .",
    "the radius @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 .",
    "= 3.5 in    the gas distribution without galaxy formation is assumed to have the same distribution as eq.([eq : nfw ] ) .",
    "the temperature profile is determined by solving the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for a spherical profile : @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that the gas does not contribute to the gravitational potential and adopt a pressure - free external boundary condition ( i.e. @xmath25 at @xmath26 ) .",
    "the result matches the density and temperature distribution in numerical simulations over the vast majority of the cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it fails in the very center ( where the numerical models are the least certain ) but this represents a small fraction of the mass ( @xmath27% ) which will end up being converted to galaxies anyway .",
    "an isothermal temperature profile produces results which are broadly similar ; however , this density distribution does not well describe the simulation results , particularly at large radius ( @xmath28 ) where much of the mass resides .",
    "once the no - cooling cluster has been constructed , we can then compute the structure of the cluster including galaxy formation . the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium sets the pressure distribution , but we need one more constraint to uniquely fix the density and temperature profiles .",
    "this comes from the entropy ( @xmath29 ) distribution of the gas , which is a monotonically increasing function of radius . since by our earlier assumption",
    ", the gas which cools into galaxies comes from the lowest entropy part of the distribution , galaxy formation is equivalent to removing from the center an amount of gas equal to @xmath30 .",
    "the remaining gas is then distributed over the whole cluster , under the assumption that it does not cool at all .",
    "the known entropy distribution of this gas combined with the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is sufficient to specify the gas and temperature profiles uniquely .",
    "more precisely , we guess a central pressure and then integrate the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium outwards in radius , or equivalently , enclosed baryonic mass @xmath31 . at each point",
    ", the density and temperature is computed from the pressure and entropy @xmath32 , with the entropy coming from the no - cooling case .",
    "we iterate this procedure with a new central pressure each time until a profile is produced which conserves mass ( i.e. @xmath33 ) .",
    "although this may superficially appear to be a cooling - flow model , it is not .",
    "the gas that cools into galaxies does so at high redshift , before the cluster even forms .",
    "the gas which goes into the galaxies is at the center of the smaller halos which merge to form a cluster .",
    "if that gas had nt cooled to form galaxies , it would have ended up in the center of the cluster , since low entropy gas will sink to the center .",
    "figure  [ fig : profiles ] shows the resulting density profiles for a range of cluster temperatures .",
    "the temperature profiles remain mostly flat , although they increase slowly towards the center and have a somewhat larger mean compared to their non - cooling equivalents .",
    "the first test is to see if the resulting clusters can match the luminosity - temperature relation . for each cluster",
    "the x - ray luminosity and luminosity - weighted temperature is computed with a raymond - smith code ( 1977 ; 1992 version ) assuming a constant metallicity of one - third solar .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : lum_temp ] along with the result for a self - similar model ( this is actually flatter than @xmath0 due to the increased importance of metal lines at low temperatures ) . in the same figure",
    ", we also show the @xmath2 relation which would result from keeping a self - similar shape for the gas profile , but reducing the gas fraction as specified by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fstar ] ) .",
    "the agreement is good , except at very low temperatures , where the observations fall below the theoretical curve .",
    "the surface brightness of these poor groups is very low , and so a significant fraction of their luminosity could be lost .",
    "helsdon & ponman ( 2000 ) estimate that for their lowest temperature cluster group ( below 1 kev ) , the total flux is underestimated by about 40% relative to the higher temperature groups . also , there is some evidence that the metallicity of small groups may be significantly less than that of larger groups @xcite .",
    "these two effects would reduce the predicted luminosity by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "there is another line of evidence which has been taken as strong evidence of preheating : ponman , cannon & navarro ( 1999 ) show that the central entropy ( at @xmath34 ) in clusters and groups does not scale in a self - similar fashion .",
    "their data are reproduced in figure  [ fig : entropy ] , along with the curve predicted from the model described in this paper .",
    "the model matches the observed data .",
    "also shown is the self - similar relation ( with constant @xmath5 ) .",
    "= 3.5 in    there is a range of other observations against which this model could be tested ; we restrict ourselves to two others .",
    "there is some evidence that the profiles of groups is flatter than that of clusters .",
    "for example , if the x - ray surface brightness profile is fit with a beta model : @xmath35 , then the outer slope @xmath36 is @xmath37 for large clusters , ranging down to @xmath38 for groups @xcite . in this expression , @xmath39 is the projected cluster core radius . as might be imagined from figure  [ fig : profiles ]",
    ", our model also shows this trend . after integrating along lines of sight ,",
    "the resulting surface brightness profile is well fit by @xmath40 for a 10.2 kev cluster and @xmath41 for a 1.2 kev group .",
    "the last check we make is to examine the evolution of the @xmath2 relation with redshift .",
    "observations @xcite show that there is very little change in this relation to @xmath42 , although the amount of data are still limited .",
    "unfortunately , no high redshift equivalent of figure  [ fig : mratio ] exists ; however , if we assume that the ratios do not change appreciably then this models also predicts little evolution to modest redshifts .",
    "indeed , most models which correctly predict @xmath1 will reproduce this lack of evolution .",
    "the reason is simple : for a fixed mass , the luminosity scales roughly as @xmath43 as long as the profile does nt change very much when expressed as a function of @xmath44 . also for a fixed mass , the virial temperature scales as @xmath45 and so modifying @xmath46",
    "moves a cluster parallel to the @xmath47 relation .",
    "in this letter , we have described a simple model of cluster formation which reproduces the self - similar breaking observations without recourse to non - gravitational heating .",
    "there are two key assumptions in this model .",
    "the first is that galaxy formation was more efficient in groups than in clusters ; as discussed in section  [ sec : model ] there is some empirical evidence for this .",
    "certainly the morphology - density relation shows that galaxies are sensitive to their environment . from a theoretical standpoint , this could arising from biasing @xcite or from cooling and shocking of gas .",
    "the second important assumption is that the lowest entropy gas is converted into galaxies , while the high - entropy gas retains the same entropy it would have had without galaxy formation .",
    "clearly this is an idealization : in practice the rest of the gas will suffer some radiative losses ( and if it cools substantially , this will invalidate the model assumed here ) .",
    "however , the approximation is self - consistent in that the remaining gas has a cooling time comparable to or longer than the hubble time .",
    "it is also true that cooling of hot gas tends to occur catastrophically ( e.g. thoul & weinberg 1995 ) .",
    "that is , it remains hot with little cooling until it passes through a cooling front , where the density suddenly increases by orders of magnitude .",
    "the gas at large radius moves towards the center without changing it s entropy .",
    "it seems clear that numerical simulations will be required to test these arguments , although it will be computationally challenging to do so .",
    "it is possible that some of the effects described in this paper may have already been seen in simulations @xcite .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with mark voit , joe mohr and the referee , richard bower .",
