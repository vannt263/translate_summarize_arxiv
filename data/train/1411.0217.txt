    "in the recent years , the performance of photovoltaic ( pv ) cells has been significantly improved by using multi - cell devices . in such systems",
    ", few different cells are combined to maximize the conversion efficiency by dividing the spectrum of solar radiation and then use a proper cell for each divided spectrum . using this approach , efficiency of 44.7% has been achieved where 4 junctions are used @xcite .",
    "the two most common methods for such device concept are splits spectrum and multi - junction solar cells . with the development of new technologies ,",
    "it has become possible to create more complex systems consisting of a higher number of cells .",
    "it has been shown that the performance of such systems can be further improved using optical concentration@xcite . for future development of such solar - cell systems , it is of significant importance to have bounds for the optimal possible efficiency .",
    "while it is relatively simple to find them in case of two or three layers , it becomes significantly more complex in case of a higher number of layers .",
    "this is due to the fact that it is necessary to find the minimal value of a multi parameter function , which is computationally challenging .",
    "the problem becomes even more complex because it is hard to find the corresponding gradient that could simplify the calculation .",
    "there is a wide range of non - gradient based optimization methods like simulated annealing @xcite , genetic algorithms @xcite , pivot method @xcite , particle swarm optimization @xcite , nelder - mead simplex ( nms ) method @xcite that are generally used to solve this type of problems .",
    "the performance of such methods is highly dependent on the function that we wish to minimize . in the case of the problem of interest ,",
    "initial test have shown that nms algorithm manages to outperform , in several tested problem instances , mentioned more complex population based methods .",
    "one of the reasons for this is the fact that due to physical properties of the problem , we have a good initial guess of the solution .",
    "our research has focused on improving the performance of this algorithm by incorporating some type of swarm intelligence .",
    "there is a wide range of meta heuristic that mimic the behavior of groups in nature , the most prominent are ant colony optimization @xcite , bee colony optimization @xcite , particle swarm optimization ( pso ) @xcite , firefly algorithm @xcite , and cuckoo search ( cs)@xcite@xcite . in the recent years , the cs @xcite algorithm has been gaining on popularity as an optimization method due to its good performance , robustness , and simplicity of implementation .",
    "research has been conducted to improve the original algorithm by changing the method of communication inside of the colony @xcite , having adaptive parameters@xcite , using quantum inspired approaches@xcite@xcite , and adapting the algorithm for parallel applications @xcite@xcite .",
    "the cs algorithm has previously been successfully applied in the field of solar cells , more precisely for parameter estimation of photovoltaic models @xcite .",
    "previously , the nms algorithm has been hybridized using genetic algorithms @xcite@xcite , ant colony optimization @xcite and particle swarm optimization @xcite resulting in very efficient global optimization algorithms .",
    "one of the main problems of hybridized methods is that although they achieve better results , they often become very complex for implementation . in this work",
    ", we introduce a cs inspired hybridization of the nms algorithm that manages to avoid this drawback but still achieves significantly better results than the original method .",
    "the general idea of our approach is to use the simplex structure from nms algorithm as a form of a nest in the cuckoo search .",
    "one of the main advantages of this approach is that we can avoid the use of the levy flight in cs .",
    "although the levy flight is a very powerful system of exploring the solution space , its performance within the cs is highly dependent on the scaling factor introduced in this method . in the presented approach , we substitute the levy flight with the flip operation of a simplex in the in the nms algorithm . in our tests , we show that the proposed method not only performs well in the case of solar cells optimization , but also achieves good results on standard benchmark functions when a lower number of parameters is considered . the cuckoo search is often a competing method to the particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms ( ga ) ; because of this , we also give a comparison to previously published results of hybridization of nms using this method . in the comparison",
    "we have shown that the new method manages to achieve a higher speed of convergence , while at the same time being much simpler to implement . to better evaluate the effect of the proposed hybridization of cs",
    "we have also conducted a comparison to other versions of the cs previously presented in literature .",
    "this has been done on a wide range of benchmark functions , from which it is noticeable that the new approach has a very good performance .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give an overview of related research , divided into 3 subsections .",
    "the first one presents the basics of the cuckoo search algorithm . in the second subsection",
    "we give an outline of the nms algorithm .",
    "in the final subsection we give an overview of previously developed hybridization of nms using swarm intelligence and genetic algorithms .",
    "the third section presents a detailed specification of the new method .",
    "the forth section is dedicated to an evaluation of the new method . in the first subsection",
    "we compare its performance on standard benchmark functions with published results for other population based hybridizations of nms .",
    "the following subsection presents a comparison to other versions of the cs algorithm . in the third subsection we present the optimization problem in pv cell and analyze the performance of the method",
    "as previously mentioned the cuckoo search is one of the population based meatheuristic for function minimization . in other words",
    "the goal of this method is to find the global minimal value @xmath0 of a function defined in the following way    @xmath1    function @xmath2 is called the objective function with @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "cuckoo search ( cs ) is an optimization algorithm that mimics the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species .",
    "more precisely , cuckoo birds lay their eggs in the nests of other host birds ( of other species ) . through an evolutive process cuckoos have managed to adapt the shape and color of eggs to the one of targeted bird species .",
    "this method of survival has been converted to a meta - heuristic approach called cuckoo search . in the corresponding algorithm",
    ", each egg in a nest will represent a solution and cuckoo egg represents a newly generated solutions .",
    "the idea is to create new , similar , and potentially higher quality solutions ( cuckoos ) to replace the low quality solutions in the nests . in the simplest form ,",
    "each nest contains one egg .",
    "the proposed meta heuristic follows several rules .    1 .",
    "each cuckoo in the colony generates one solution ( egg ) at each step , similar to an already existing solution ( nest ) , 2 .",
    "the best solution will be carried to the next generation , 3 .   the number of available solutions that are used as nests is fixed , and at each step , new solutions are generated .",
    "this has a consequence that some solutions need to be discarding , which corresponds to eggs being found by the host bird .",
    "the discarding operation is only done on some set of worst solutions ( nests ) , more precisely for each such nest @xmath4 there is a probability @xmath5 of being found .",
    "the standard cs algorithm following these rules is presented in the following pseudo code :    generate an initial population of @xmath3 host nests ; get a cuckoo randomly ( say , @xmath6 ) and replace its solution by performing levy flights ; evaluate its quality / fitness @xmath7 choose a nest among @xmath3 ( say , @xmath8 ) randomly ; replace @xmath8 by the new solution ; a fraction ( @xmath5 ) of the worse nests are abandoned and new ones are built ; keep the best solutions / nests ; rank the solutions / nests and find the current best ; pass the current best solutions to the next generation ;    levy flight is an essential part of the cs algorithm .",
    "it is defined by the following equation    @xmath9    where @xmath10 represents a step size .",
    "[ levi1 ] basically represents a stochastic equation for a random walk which is a markov chain .",
    "more precisely , the next position or function value that shall be evaluated depends on two parameters ; namely , the current position and transition function ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the next position ( status ) depends only on the current position ( @xmath12 ) and probability of transition ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "levy(@xmath13 ) , which is the random step length , is drawn from a levy distribution .",
    "the consecutive positions generated through steps of the levy flight create a random walk that has a heavy tail distribution .",
    "the use of levy flight instead of a simple random walk significantly improves the performance of cs .",
    "as presented in this pseudo code , the cs algorithm has several stages .",
    "the first stage is to generate the initial population . in the main loop of the algorithm a new solution @xmath7",
    "is generated using levy flight from a random nest @xmath6 . if this solution is better than a one belonging to random nest @xmath14 , the @xmath14 substituted by @xmath7 .",
    "finally , in the goal of increasing the diversity of the search , a fraction @xmath5 of the worst nests is changed using levy flight with a larger step applied to avoid trapping in local optimal solutions .",
    "the main advantage of the cs search is its robustness and its dependence on only a few number of parameters that are needed to be fine tuned .",
    "certainly , these parameters depend on the function that is being optimized like in the case of pso and ga .",
    "the nelder  mead simplex method , frequently called the downhill simplex method or amoeba method , is widely used for finding local minima solutions , for well defined problems for which a derivative is not known .",
    "the nms falls in the general class of direct search methods.the basic component of the algorithm is a simplex . in case of a two parameter function ,",
    "a simplex is a triangle , and the method results in a pattern search that is dependent of the values of the three vertices of the triangle . in a similar way for a @xmath15 dimension function",
    "a simplex will have @xmath16 vertices .",
    "in general , the method replaces some of the worst points ( which have the largest values of the @xmath2 ) of the simplex with a new vertices that are acquired using a heuristic approach . in this way the simplex is transformed to a new one which is potentially closer to the minima .",
    "there are several potential transformation refection , expansion , contraction and shrinkage that define the generation of the search @xcite . in nms algorithm , the heuristic choice and the application of the transformation are called a flip .",
    "more precisely the nms algorithm is defined in the following way . for function @xmath2 with @xmath3 dimensions ,",
    "a simplex will be a convex hull consisting of @xmath17 vertices .",
    "we will define a simplex with vertices @xmath18 by @xmath19 .",
    "the nms generates iteratively a sequence of simplices by performing the following procedure .",
    "first all of the vertices inside of simplex @xmath19 are sorted depending on the objective function value    @xmath20    at each of iteration some of the vertices are removed from the simplex and new ones are added . using the following steps    * reflection + the reflection point @xmath21",
    "is calculated using the following formula + @xmath22 + in eq .",
    "[ reflection ] @xmath23 represents the centroid of the simplex calculated in the following way + @xmath24 + in case the value of @xmath25 satisfies the condition @xmath26 we replace @xmath27 with @xmath21 and go to next iteration .",
    "* expansion + in case @xmath28 , an additional step is done to attempt by calculating an expansion vertex @xmath29 .",
    "+ @xmath30 + if @xmath31 satisfies @xmath32 replace @xmath27 with @xmath29 otherwise with @xmath21 .",
    "* outside contraction + in case @xmath33 , compute the outside contraction point .",
    "@xmath34 + if @xmath35 satisfies @xmath36 replace @xmath27 with @xmath37 otherwise do a shrink operation . * inside contraction + in case @xmath38 , compute the inside contraction point .",
    "+ @xmath39 + if @xmath40 satisfies @xmath41 replace @xmath27 with @xmath42 otherwise do a shrink operation .",
    "* shrink + @xmath43    to fully define the flip operation it is necessary to specify the values of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "their values should satisfy the following conditions .",
    "@xmath48    in the standard implementation these parameters have the following values : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in our hybridization of nms we have used these values .",
    "we wish to mention that the nms algorithm , and consequently the proposed hybridization , can be further improved by incorporating adaptive parameters @xcite .",
    "there are two main disadvantages of the cs algorithm .",
    "first , it does not incorporate any type of local search to increase the convergence speed when it is close to some local or global minima , but only uses the levy flight to generate new test positions .",
    "contrary to this , ga and pso are much faster in narrowing to optima when they are close .",
    "the second problem is that the performance of cs is highly dependant on the value of @xmath44 in eq .",
    "[ levi1 ] .",
    "it has been shown that its value does not only depend to the on scale the test function , but for high precision of results , its value needs to adapt during the execution of the algorithm .",
    "there has been a wide range of approaches to improve the performance of cs by hybridization .",
    "it has been shown that combining cs with other types of population based algorithms is a good approach .",
    "some of the most successful ones are its combination with ga @xcite , pso @xcite , differential evolution @xcite , and ant colony optimization @xcite .",
    "although this type of hybridization manages to improve the performance of the original method , the implementation becomes significantly more complex than the basic cs .",
    "on the other hand , it could be argued that the new methods , which couples two population based techniques , that are generally more suitable for globalized searches , combines to very similar approaches .",
    "it is also important to mention that very limited research has been done in the hybridization of cs with some local search methods , which has proven to be very profitable for other population based algorithms .    in our work ,",
    "we attempt to improve the performance of cs , by hybridization with nms algorithm while maintaining the simplicity and robustness of the original algorithm .",
    "previously , population based algorithms have been successfully combined with nms @xcite .",
    "there are two main directions to this type of hybridization ; namely , cascaded or tandem @xcite . in the cascaded approach ,",
    "the two methods are used consecutively , and resulting in a more globalized search . in case of a tandem hybridization",
    ", the two methods influence each others performance and generally result in a more localized search which is more suitable for functions with a lower number of parameters .",
    "in the case of optimization of solar cells , the functions of interest would have from 3 - 10 parameters , so we have focused on developing a more localized search using the tandem approach .",
    "the focus of the method is to find solutions of good quality with a low number of functions evaluations .",
    "the incentive for this is the fact that the calculation of efficiency of multi layer solar cells is computationally very expensive .",
    "as previously mentioned , the goal is to find the minima of a function containing a relatively small number of parameters ( 3 - 10 ) . to achieve this",
    ", we have hybridized the nms using cuckoo search .",
    "the general idea is to exploit the effectiveness of nms as a local search algorithm , but combine it with the cs to get a wider search area . by combining cs with nms , the original method becomes more capable in narrowing down to good solutions .",
    "one of the problems of cs is that except for the focusing of the search by the replacement of lower quality solutions with better ones , the search is relatively random . in the new approach ,",
    "we wish to search the solution space in a more structured way .",
    "this is done by incorporating the flip operation from nms to cs .",
    "the changes to the original cs method are the following :    * nests in the new method are simplexes instead of parameter values that correspond to good solution . as a consequence",
    "the initial population will be a set of simplexes . *",
    "while in the original cs , levy flight is used to explore new solutions , in the new method , this is done using the flip operation of nms .",
    "more precisely , at each step of the algorithm , nest @xmath6 is transformed to nest @xmath53 by using a flip . * in the presented approach , only a part of the vertices inside of a simplex are replaced .",
    "this is because a simple replacement of lower quality nests with better ones in the case of using simplexes combined with the flip operation is not productive .",
    "this is due to the fact that nms has a deterministic search pattern , and if this was done , we would be just repeating the tests for same solutions .",
    "the new approach can be formalized by the following pseudo code .",
    "generate an initial population of @xmath3 simplexes ; test @xmath54 solutions ; get a cuckoo randomly ( say , @xmath6 ) and replace its using a nms flip ; evaluate its quality / fitness @xmath7 choose a nest among @xmath3 ( say , @xmath8 ) randomly ; replace worst @xmath55 vertices in simplex @xmath8 by the vertices from simplex @xmath6 ; a fraction ( @xmath5 ) of the worse simplex are abandoned and new ones are built ; keep the best solutions / nests ; rank the solutions / nests and find the current best ;    the initial simplexes are generated around randomly selected points , with a relatively small sizes .",
    "we use a slight modification of the approach for generating simplexes proposed by l. pfeffer , which is also used in matlab implementation of nms @xcite .",
    "a simplex @xmath19 with vertices @xmath56 is generated around a vertex @xmath57 .",
    "all of the coordinates of @xmath56 are equal to the ones of @xmath4 except the one on position @xmath6 , which is calculated as    @xmath58    in eq .",
    "[ randomsimplex ] @xmath59 represents the value of @xmath56 at position @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath44 is a random parameter that is used generate simplexes of different sizes . in our test the best results where achieved when @xmath44 had a uniform distribution inside of the interval @xmath60",
    "as it has been previously mentioned , the flip operation is simply used instead of the levy flight , as it can be seen in the pseudo code .",
    "the substitution of nest of lower quality is done by coping some of the vertices of the lowest quality by some of the high quality ones from the better simplex .    at this stage , there are two important details that must be pointed out .",
    "first , the best vertex from the higher quality nest ( simplex ) is not used because this would make the search focus very quickly .",
    "if the other high quality vertexes are used , the search focuses towards good solutions but still remains diverse .",
    "this stage has two possibilities , either a relatively random search of the space in the direction of the higher quality nest if the simplexes are distant or a wider search around the good solution if the simplexes are close to each other .",
    "the algorithm has two parameters @xmath61 and @xmath55 that are used for fine tuning of the method . the part of vertexes @xmath55 that should be overwritten is dependent on the number of parameters of the function that we wish to minimize . in our experiments",
    ", it has been shown that for functions with a low number of parameters , the value @xmath62 vertices is a good choice .",
    "in general , if this number is too low the search needs many steps to actually move to the region of good solutions , and contrary if it is two large this movement is too fast .",
    "the second tuning parameter @xmath61 is used to specify how randomized the search will be , or in other words , how frequently new random nests will be generated . in our test it has been shown that having @xmath61 equal to two times the number of nests is a good choice .",
    "in this section , we present results of using the new method to optimize two sets of problems .",
    "the first test are conducted on standard benchmark test functions and compared to previously published results @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we have compared our method to the hybridizations of nms with pso and nms with ga on problems of 3 - 10 parameters .",
    "since pso and ga are methods that often competing methods cs , this gives us a good evaluation of the new hybridized method .",
    "to fully evaluate the effect of the proposed hybridization of the cs , in the second section we present a comparison to other version of the cs . in the final part of our tests ,",
    "we analyze the performance of the new method on a practical problem of optimization of multijunction and split spectrum solar cells .",
    "we have tested the effectiveness of our method for systems with a 3 - 10 different cells of both types . to be able to have a quantitative evaluation of the new method ,",
    "it has been compared to nms , simulated annealing and ga .",
    "the method has been implemented by creating code using matlab r2013a .",
    "the calculations have been done on a machine with intel(r ) core(tm ) i7 - 2630 qm cpu 2.00 ghz , 4 gb of ddr3 - 1333 ram , running on microsoft windows 7 home premium 64-bit .      in our first group of test",
    ", we compare the performance of the new method to hybridization of nms with two other population based meta heuristics , ga and pso . test has been done on 10 different test functions as presented by fan et al .",
    "@xcite and chelouah and siarry @xcite where their definitions can be found .",
    "tests for functions with two variables have been done for the branin rcoc ( @xmath63 ) , b2 , goldstein and price ( @xmath64 ) , shubert ( @xmath65 ) , zakharov ( @xmath66 ) ; with three variables hartmann ( @xmath67 ) , and with four variables on the shekel @xmath68 .",
    "the test has also been done on the rosenbrock ( @xmath69 ) function for 2 , 5 and 10 parameters . for each of the test functions , 100 runs of the nms - cs algorithm",
    "have been done with different initial simplex positions similarly to what is done in article @xcite . in the two competing algorithms",
    "the initial vertices are randomly selected inside of the specified search domain , while in the case of the proposed hybridization these vertices are used for generating the initial simplixes using the method presented in the previous section . in the results section of the mentioned article , ``",
    "successful '' runs are defined for solutions that have a certain level of precision .",
    "we have excluded this measure from the results given in table [ table : necreloc ] , since our method has had a 100 successless runs for each of the 10 test functions ; as it had been the case with nms - ga and nms - pso given in @xcite . in our test , we have used the same stopping criteria as in article @xcite or when a high enough precision is reached .",
    "the stopping criterion is given in the following equation    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the average of the best @xmath15 solutions .",
    "this criterion is based on the standard deviation of the objective function values over @xmath15 best solutions.the chosen value for @xmath72 . in the case of the previous published work @xmath15 was equivalent to one third of the population . in the case of the proposed method @xmath73 would represent the best solution inside of simpex @xmath6 , and consequently we would only observe the best third ( @xmath15 ) simplexes .",
    "the nms - cs has used 6 nests for all the test functions except @xmath74 where it was 20 .",
    "this is lower then the recommended 25 nests for the cs which is used in a wide range of articles .",
    "we believe that nms - cs has achieved the best results when using a much smaller number of nest due to fact that it uses the nms flip operation to narrow in on solutions .",

    "it is noticeable that the new method has the greatest advantage when compared to the two other methods in the case of uni - modal functions .",

    "had , in the case of small ones , the flip operation makes it possible to quickly converge to the nearby local or global optimal solution .",
    "the method has had a better performance in the case of functions of 2 and 5 dimensions . when it is compared to the original cs algorithm it presents a significant improvement .",

    "this can be concluded when we observe the results presented in the tables [ table : dim2 ] , [ table : dim5 ] and [ table : dim10 ] , where the methods has a much higher number of best found minimal solutions than average ones .              in this section",
    ", we applied the presented method to the practical problem of optimizing the performance of multi - cell solar systems and mainly on multi - junction and split spectrum solar cells . finding the optimal efficiency of such cells is of high complexity due to the fact that the underlining equations are highly nonlinear .",
    "previously , research has been conducted in finding limits for different mathematical models.@xcite these problem of finding the in multi - junction solar cells , few cells of different energy gaps ( @xmath80 ) are stacked in layers where in between buffer layers are used to allow transporting the photogenerated carriers between the cells . this type of cells is schematically represented in figure-[mjsc ] and it is conceptually a two - terminal system with a series stack of two - level cells . as @xmath80s differ , each layer ( or cell ) abosrbs a portion of the incident solar radiation ( i.e. for photonenergy above the layer @xmath80 ) .",
    "other photons are transimited to the next layer . this selective absortion / transmission is the mean for spectrum division .",
    "split spectrum solar cell system , follow a different approach . in this system ,",
    "the idea is to split solar radiation by a pre - optical setup and then direct each of the split spectrum into a cell with matching @xmath80 .",
    "we can see an illustration of this type of cells in figure-[sssc ] .    practically , there are few differences between the two concepts .",
    "the main difference is current continuity . in split - spectrum system ,",
    "the photogenerated carriers are collected separately for each cell .",
    "so , there is no physical constraint in this regard .",
    "however , in multi - junction cells , the photogenerated current from ny cell should be reinjected in the next one .",
    "hence , it is essential to maintain the continuity .",
    "there have been several strategies to estimate the practical efficiency limits of cells of this type . estimating the upper limit for multi - cell devices such as multi - junction and split spectrum , can be achieved by extending the single junction model @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use the detailed balance model develop by hanna and nozik @xcite .    in both multi - junction and solar cell ,",
    "the spectrum is ideally split based on the @xmath80s of the different cells . for @xmath15-cell system where the gaps are ordered ascendingly , the photogenerated generated current in the i@xmath81 cell is    @xmath82    @xmath83 is the electron charge , and @xmath84 is photon energy ( in @xmath85 ) , and @xmath86 is the standard am1.5 g flux . for the last cell ,",
    "the upper limit is @xmath87 .",
    "in the ideal case , it is assumed that radiative recombination is the only cause for recombination .",
    "so , the recombination current is calculated based on the generalized black body radiation as follow @xmath88 hence , the resulted overall generated current in the i@xmath81 cell is @xmath89 then for each cell , the conversion efficiency becomes @xmath90    in split spectrum cells , the photogenerated current is extracted separately for each cell .",
    "so , the total efficiency is @xmath91 for multi - jucntion , it is necessary to have the photogenerated current flow from one cell to the other before extracted in the external terminals .",
    "this series connection requires that the current must be the same in all of them and it is equal to the lowest current achieved in any of the cells .",
    "this fact resulted in changing the total efficiency to @xmath92 the goal of the optimization is to maximize @xmath93 and hence for practical application , we are actually minimizing the value @xmath94 .    in the experiments , the performance of the new method is compared with nms , sa and ga for split spectrum and multi - junction solar cells .",
    "the tests are conducted for solar cells that have 4 to 10 layers . for each of the problem sizes ,",
    "we have compared the quality of results that can be archived using 1500 function evaluations . for nms ,",

    "we have fine    for the sa and the ga we have conducted a large number of tests on the smallest problem sizes to fine tune the parameters available in matlab for defining these methods .",
    "when specifying the properties of the sa , we found that the optimal initial temperature for the optimization algorithm was 100.the temperature function used was set with the matlab parameter temperatureexp , in which the temperature at any given step was 0.95 times the temperature from the previous one .",
    "the reannaling interval was set to 100 , the step has length square root of temperature , as defined by the matlab parameter value annealingboltz . in case of ga the population size",
    "was set to 15 out of which 2 where consider as elitist .",
    "the crossover fraction was set to 0.8 .",
    "the mutation was set by the matlab parameter value mutationuniform , which correspond to selection rate of 0.01 .    from physical properties of the problem",
    ", it is known that @xmath80 values should belong to the domain @xmath95 .",
    "solar radiation vanishes for photon energy above 4 @xmath85 . for the problem of interest",
    ", it is known that high quality solutions can be found close to @xmath80 values that equally divide the photogenerated carriers or if the corresponding voltages are equably divided in the expected range . in case of nms ,",
    "the search is started using 10 different starting points , out of which 2 correspond to the parameter values close to which it is expected to find good solutions and 8 random selection of parameters . in case of sa ,",
    "only two starting points for which the highest quality of solutions is expected .",
    "we have used the same parameter sets as for nms and 5 new random ones for the initial population . in case of nms - cs , the same initial points as for ga have been used to generate the starting 15 nests ( simplexes ) .",
    "the calculation time for all of the methods was very similar due to the fact that the evaluation of the efficiency function is the most computationally expensive part .",
    "because of the long execution time , only a single run has been conducted , in the sense that 1500 function evaluations have been done , for each of the methods . in table",

    "nms manages to get better results than ga in case of smaller problem instances , which can be explained by the fact that the smaller size of the solution space , make a local search method more effective . in all of the tested cases ,",

    "an example of this are the performance of ga and nms cs in the case of 5 and 9 cells respectably , where the found efficiency is much lower than expected .",

    "in this paper , we have presented a new method for the minimization of multi - parameter functions , with the focus on its application for the maximization of efficiency of multi - cell solar systems .",
    "the method is a hybridization of the cs with nms algorithm .",
    "the new approach incorporates some fundamental parts of the nms into cs .",
    "more precisely , it uses simplexes for nests in the cs , which makes it possible to use the nms flip operation instead of the levy flight . in this way",
    ", the good properties of nms , as a local search , are preserved while the new methods manages to also conduct a effective exploration of a larger solution space . in comparison to the original cs algorithm",
    ", the hybridized approach becomes more capable for finding high quality solutions since it is combined to a local search method .",
    "a second advantage of the new method is the higher level of robustness , since it avoids using some tuning parameters that exist in cs .",
    "the new approach has been tailored for the specific problem of solar cell optimization .",
    "although the function corresponding to this problem has a relatively low number of parameters 3 - 10 , the complexity comes from the fact that the its evaluation is computationally expensive . in our experiments",
    ", we have shown that the new approach manages to outperform nms , ga , and sa for this problem . to better evaluate the new method",
    "we have also compared its performance to other hybridizations of nms using population based meta heuristics like ga and pso .",
    "we have shown that the new method is very competitive , and in many cases outperforms , these algorithms on standard benchmark functions .",
