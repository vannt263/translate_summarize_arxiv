    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) has turned out to be a very fruitful tool in studying the phenomenon of chiral symmetry breaking in low ",
    "energy qcd @xcite .",
    "first proposed as a purely phenomenological approach , it has recently been put onto firm field theoretic grounds after the analytic rmt predictions have been reproduced within the framework of finite  volume partition functions and partially quenched chiral perturbation theory using supersymmetry @xcite and replica @xcite techniques .    similarly to previously studied sum rules @xcite , rmt solutions for spectral statistics serve as a more detailed test of qcd lattice data , in particular for a given sector of topological charge @xmath2 ( which counts the number of zero modes of the qcd dirac operator ) .",
    "this has become possible due to recent developments in lattice gauge theory .",
    "namely , the ginsparg - wilson relation was shown to provide an exact chiral symmetry on the lattice together with a well defined topological charge @xmath2 @xcite ( and these proceedings ) .",
    "the classification of the three different @xmath3sb patterns according to gauge group and representation @xcite has been confronted to lattice data and good agreement has been found for the spectral density and distribution of the smallest dirac eigenvalue for _ massless _ lattice data of all @xmath4 patterns and for different values of @xmath2 ( see e.g. @xcite , fig .",
    "2 ) .    it has to be mentioned that the direct field theoretic calculation of spectral correlators is much more cumbersome as compared to rmt .",
    "the former approach has not led to any explicit analytic results beyond the spectral density due to enormous increase of dimensionality of auxiliary ( supermatrix ) fields involved .",
    "so far , only spectral densities for massless flavors ( in all three @xmath3sb patterns ) and for one single massive flavor ( in @xmath5 in the fundamental representation ) have been derived @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the classic rmt technique is free of the above technical complications and allows computing the higher order correlation functions with the same ease ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for comparison with lattice data ) .",
    "this advantage of a rmt description becomes even more significant for dynamical fermions .",
    "the correlation functions with an arbitrary number of massive flavors @xmath6 have been calculated for fundamental @xmath5 @xcite @xmath7 and recently for the two remaining @xmath3sb patterns @xcite @xmath8 .    in the present communication",
    ", we report on our results @xcite relevant for gauge groups @xmath9 in the fundamental ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 in the adjoint representation ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "our predictions are compared to @xmath9 lattice data @xcite for dynamical staggered fermions with 4 degenerate flavors .",
    "let us briefly recall the connection between rmt and low  energy qcd .",
    "the dirac operator spectrum at the origin is related to the chiral condensate @xmath12 , the order parameter of @xmath3sb , through the banks - casher relation @xcite @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the euclidean space - time volume . here",
    ", the spectral density of the dirac operator is given by the average @xmath15 over all gauge field configurations and the @xmath16 are the dirac operator eigenvalues . in the limit",
    "@xmath17 @xcite , where @xmath18 is the pion mass and @xmath19 is the scale of the lightest non - goldstone particle , the qcd partition function is dominated by zero momentum modes of the goldstone fields and hence collapses into a simple group integral @xcite . as a result , the partition function only depends on the global symmetries of the qcd dirac operator and contains just the rescaled quark masses @xmath20 as parameters . in a sector with fixed topological charge @xmath2",
    ", it coincides with the corresponding rmt partition function once the space - time volume @xmath14 is identified with the size @xmath21 of the corresponding random matrix .",
    "analogously , all correlation functions can also be computed from rmt provided the matrix eigenvalues are appropriately rescaled , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 or @xmath24 is taken ; @xmath25 denotes the rmt spectral density .",
    "this provides us with a parameter free prediction .",
    "the joint probability density function of chiral rmt associated with @xmath6 massive quarks in the sector of topological charge @xmath2 is defined as @xmath26 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath27 and @xmath28 labels the symmetry of the matrix ensemble to be orthogonal ( @xmath29 ) , unitary ( @xmath30 ) or symplectic ( @xmath31 ) in correspondence with the three @xmath3sb patterns @xcite .",
    "the partition function appearing in the normalization is obtained by integrating over all eigenvalues @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath32-point correlation function is determined by integrating over @xmath33 eigenvalues only : @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the vandermonde determinant and the weight function is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a finite - polynomial confinement potential whose form is not fixed apriori .",
    "although the simplest choice @xmath38 defining the gaussian ensemble leads to significant mathematical simplifications it can not be derived from the qcd lagrangian .",
    "it is therefore crucial to show that the rmt results for the rescaled @xmath32-point correlation functions , eq .",
    "( [ microk - pt ] ) , are universal and do not depend . ] on this choice for @xmath37 .    in the following",
    "we present a unified way to explicitly calculate , and prove , the rmt universality of massive spectral correlators for all three @xmath39 patterns , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "our strategy is to express the _ massive _ spectral correlators in terms of the known _ massless _ ones ; the latter have already been shown to be universal @xcite . to proceed",
    ", we assume that the massive fermions are @xmath40fold degenerate . with the help of the identity",
    "@xmath41 the joint probability density @xmath42 associated with the @xmath40fold degenerate massive fermions of total amount @xmath43 can be rewritten through the massless joint probability density @xmath44 with @xmath21 positive @xmath45 and @xmath6 negative @xmath46 eigenvalues .",
    "this leads us to the remarkable identity @xcite which holds in all generality for finite @xmath21 : @xmath47 in order to compare with qcd we have to perform the microscopic large-@xmath21 limit as mentioned above .",
    "it reduces to evaluating the rescaled ( or unfolded ) correlators @xmath48 with a similar rescaling of the masses . here",
    ", we have switched from positive to real dirac operator eigenvalues .",
    "it is easy to see that eqs .",
    "( [ master - n ] ) and ( [ microk - pt ] ) result in the following expression for the microscopic @xmath32-point correlation function with @xmath49 masses : @xmath50 here , @xmath51 is the _ massless _ correlation function which is entirely known @xcite in terms of determinants @xmath52 or quaternion determinants @xmath53 . since the universality of massless correlation functions has already been firmly established , the universality of the massive ones automatically follows .",
    "alternative representations of massive correlation functions were derived in ref .",
    "@xcite using gaussian ensembles . there",
    ", the mass degeneracy for @xmath31 is partially lifted to be two - fold .    in the simplest situation of the spectral density with @xmath40",
    "degenerate massive fermions , eq .",

    "( [ k=1massive ] ) to the symmetry class @xmath10 was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and we will not consider it in what follows .",
    "however , it is instructive to consider the simplest example , the symmetry class @xmath56 .",
    "the connected part of the two - point correlation function is proportional to the square of the unitary kernel @xmath57 combining eqs .",
