    "it is well known since a long time ( see _ e.g. _ ( @xcite ) ) that a test body kept at rest in schwarzschild s gravitational field undergoes a four - acceleration whose norm tends to infinity if the position of the body is closer and closer to the schwarzschild two - surface .",
    "however the existence of this singular behaviour of the gravitational pull , despite the fact that it can be given an invariant description , has not generally aroused very much concern . by far greater attention has been directed to the features of the world line followed by a test body in free motion , and already in 1950 it has been shown ( @xcite ) that , once the singularity in the components of the metric is removed through a coordinate transformation that is aptly non regular at the schwarzschild surface , a radial timelike geodesic may reach the schwarzschild singularity and `` cross it without a bump '' .",
    "this early finding by synge has been the turning point for the program of analytic extension @xcite,@xcite .",
    "of course , geodesic motion has a fundamental role in general relativity .",
    "nevertheless , it is quite reassuring that the very notion of the force exerted on a test body that is kept at rest , that has played so fundamental a role in the development of physical knowledge , does find a meaningful , _",
    "i.e. _ invariant definition in general relativity .",
    "it is less reassuring that the norm of that force may be allowed to grow without limit at some surface in the interior of a manifold meant to be a realistic model of physical occurrences , without providing a justification for this allowance in physical terms .",
    "the definition of the gravitational force felt by a test body of unit mass kept at rest in a static field is connected to the geometric definition of the four - acceleration by way of hypothesis .",
    "it would be interesting to calculate this force in an invariant way without availing of this hypothesis : einstein s equations alone should suffice for the task . in the present paper the norm of the force exerted on a test body in schwarzschild s field",
    "is obtained by starting , in the footsteps of weyl @xcite,@xcite , from a particular two - body solution of einstein s equations calculated in 1922 by r. bach @xcite .",
    "while the spherically symmetric field of a `` massenpunkt '' was determined by k. schwarzschild @xcite soon after the discovery of the field equations of general relativity @xcite , @xcite the class of axially symmetric , static solutions , that could provide some indication about the gravitational pull in a two - body system , was later found @xcite , @xcite by weyl and by levi - civita . despite the nonlinear structure of the field equations , weyl succeeded in reducing the problem to quadratures through the introduction of his `` canonical cylindrical coordinates '' .",
    "let @xmath3 be the time coordinate , while @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the coordinates in a meridian half - plane , and @xmath6 is the azimuth of such a half - plane ; then the line element of a static , axially symmetric field _ in vacuo _ can be tentatively written as : @xmath7 the two functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 depend only on @xmath10 and @xmath11 . remarkably enough , in the `` bildraum '' introduced by weyl @xmath8 fulfils the potential equation @xmath12 ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the derivatives with respect to @xmath10 and to @xmath11 respectively ) , while @xmath9 is obtained by solving the system @xmath15 due to the potential equation ( [ 2.2 ] ) @xmath16 happens to be an exact differential",
    ".    schwarzschild s original `` massenpunkt''solution @xcite is recovered exactly when @xmath8 is that solution of ( [ 2.2 ] ) corresponding to the newtonian potential that one obtains if one segment of the @xmath10-axis is covered by matter with constant mass density @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be the coordinate length of this segment , and let @xmath18 , @xmath19 be the `` distances '' , calculated in the euclidean way , of a point @xmath20 with canonical coordinates @xmath10 , @xmath11 from the end points @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the segment , that lie on the symmetry axis at @xmath23 and at @xmath24 respectively .",
    "one finds @xmath25 through a coordinate transformation in the meridian half - plane one proves the agreement with schwarzschild s result , if @xmath26 is substituted for @xmath0 .",
    "we draw the attention of the reader on the fact that the agreement occurs with schwarzschild s original solution @xcite , not with what is called `` schwarzschild solution '' in all the textbooks , but is in fact the spherically symmetric solution found by hilbert through his peculiar choice of the radial coordinate @xcite .",
    "in fact by setting @xmath27 one finds that the spatial part @xmath28 of the square of the line element on the segment @xmath29 becomes @xmath30 _",
    "i.e. _ it coincides with the square of the line element of the spherical two - surface that is present at @xmath31 in schwarzschild s true and original solution @xcite of einstein s equations . the solution given by ( [ 2.5 ] )",
    "is in one - to - one correspondence with that solution , and it does not contain the `` interior region '' that hilbert could not help finding @xcite due to the particular way he kept in fixing the radial coordinate .    a static two - body solution is instead obtained if one assumes , like bach did @xcite , that the `` newtonian potential '' @xmath8 is generated by matter that is present with constant mass density on two segments of the symmetry axis , like the segments @xmath32 and @xmath29 of figure 1 .",
    ", @xmath11 half - plane of the mass sources for bach s two - body solution .",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath19 , @xmath18 are the `` distances '' , calculated in the euclidean way , of a point @xmath20 from the end points of the two segments endowed with mass .",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , again in coordinate lengths .",
    "]    we know already that the particular choice @xmath38 will produce a vacuum solution to einstein s field equations that reduces to schwarzschild s original solution if one sets either @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "of course , due to the nonlinearity of ( [ 2.3 ] ) one can not expect that @xmath9 will contain only the sum of the contributions @xmath41 corresponding to the individual terms of the potential ( [ 2.8 ] ) ; a further term is present , that bach called @xmath42 , and reads @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a constant .",
    "since @xmath9 must vanish at the spatial infinity , it must be @xmath45 $ ] . with this choice of",
    "the constant one eventually finds @xcite that the line element of the two - body solution is defined by the functions @xmath46 with these definitions for @xmath8 and @xmath9 the line element ( [ 2.1 ] ) behaves properly at the spatial infinity and is regular everywhere , except for the two segments @xmath32 , @xmath29 of the symmetry axis , where the sources of @xmath8 are located , and also for the segment @xmath47 , because there @xmath9 does not vanish as required , but takes the constant value @xmath48 thus giving rise to the well known conical singularity .",
    "due to this lack of elementary flatness occurring on the segment @xmath47 the solution is not a true two - body solution ; nevertheless weyl showed @xcite that a regular solution could be obtained from it , provided that nonvanishing energy tensor density @xmath49 be allowed for in the space between the two bodies . in this way",
    "an axial force @xmath50 is introduced , with the evident function of keeping the two bodies at rest despite their mutual gravitational attraction . by providing a measure for @xmath50 , weyl provided a measure of the gravitational pull .",
    "let us recall here weyl s analysis @xcite,@xcite of the axially symmetric , static two - body problem .",
    "in writing einstein s field equations , we adopt henceforth weyl s convention for the energy tensor : @xmath51 einstein s equations teach that , when the line element has the expression ( [ 2.1 ] ) , @xmath49 shall have the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 by introducing the notation @xmath54 einstein s equations can be written as : @xmath55 @xmath56 weyl shows that @xmath57 must be interpreted as mass density in the canonical space . to this end",
    "he considers the mass density distribution sketched in figure 2 , where @xmath57 is assumed to be nonvanishing only in the shaded regions labeled @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    , @xmath11 half - plane of extended mass sources of a two - body solution . ]",
    "according to ( [ 3.5 ] ) the potential @xmath8 corresponding to this mass distribution can be uniquely split in two terms @xmath60 and @xmath61 , such that @xmath60 is a potential function that vanishes at infinity and is everywhere regular outside the region @xmath58 , while @xmath61 behaves in the same way outside the region @xmath59 .",
    "the asymptotic forms of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are such that @xmath62 where the mass coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 are given by the integral @xmath65 , performed in the canonical space and extended to the appropriate shaded region . outside the shaded regions one has @xmath66 , but there shall be some region between the bodies , let us call it @xmath67 , where @xmath66 but @xmath68 , since in a static solution of general relativity the gravitational pull shall be counteracted in some way .",
    "weyl s procedure for determining @xmath49 in @xmath67 is the following .",
    "suppose that @xmath69 outside a simply connected region @xmath70 that includes both material bodies .",
    "since @xmath8 is known there , we can avail of ( [ 2.4 ] ) , together with the injunction that @xmath9 vanish at infinity , to determine @xmath9 uniquely outside @xmath70 . within @xmath67",
    "we can choose @xmath9 arbitrarily , provided that we ensure the regular connection with the vacuum region and the regular behaviour on the axis , _ i.e. _ @xmath9 vanishing there like @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath8 is known in @xmath67 and @xmath9 has been chosen as just shown , we can use equations ( [ 3.5 ] ) and ( [ 3.6 ] ) to determine @xmath49 there .",
    "if the material bodies include each one a segment of the axis , just as it occurs in fig .",
    "2 , the force @xmath50 directed along the @xmath10 axis , with which the stresses in @xmath67 contrast the gravitational pull can be written as @xmath72 the integration path is along a curve @xmath73 , like the one drawn in fig .",
    "2 , that separates the two bodies in the meridian half - plane ; the value of the integral does not depend on the precise position of @xmath73 because , as one gathers from the definitions ( [ 3.5 ] ) , ( [ 3.6 ] ) : @xmath74 in the region @xmath67 .",
    "since the region of the meridian half - plane where @xmath66 is simply connected , by starting from @xmath8 and from the vacuum equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) , now rewritten as : @xmath75 one can uniquely define there the function @xmath76 that vanishes at the spatial infinity .",
    "in all the parts of the @xmath10 axis where @xmath66 it must be @xmath77 , @xmath78 , hence @xmath79 , @xmath78 . in particular , in the parts of the axis that go to infinity one shall have @xmath80 ; let us call @xmath81 the constant value assumed instead by @xmath76 on the segment of the axis lying between the two bodies .",
    "the definitions ( [ 3.6 ] ) can now be rewritten as : @xmath82 and the integral of ( [ 3.8 ] ) becomes @xmath83 since @xmath9 vanishes on the parts of the @xmath10 axis where @xmath66 , the force @xmath50 that holds the bodies at rest despite the gravitational pull shall be @xmath84 with weyl s definition ( [ 3.1 ] ) of the energy tensor .",
    "when the mass density @xmath57 has in the canonical space the particular distribution considered by bach and drawn in fig . 1",
    ", @xmath81 is equal to @xmath85 as defined by ( [ 2.12 ] ) .",
    "the measure of the gravitational pull with which the two `` material bodies '' of this particular solution attract each other therefore turns out to be @xmath86 in weyl s units .",
    "this expression agrees with the newtonian value when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are small when compared to @xmath87 , as expected .",
    "despite its mathematical beauty , weyl s definition of the gravitational pull for an axially symmetric , static two - body solution appears associated without remedy to the adoption of the canonical coordinate system .",
    "it is however possible to obtain through weyl s definition of @xmath50 , given by ( [ 3.8 ] ) , a `` quasi '' four - vector @xmath88 .",
    "in fact that expression can be rewritten as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is levi - civita s totally antisymmetric tensor and @xmath91 is the element of the two - surface @xmath92 generated by the curve @xmath73 through rotation around the symmetry axis .",
    "since the metric is static it is possible to define invariantly a timelike killing vector @xmath93 that correspond , in weyl s canonical coordinates , to a unit coordinate time translation .",
    "therefore ( [ 4.1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath94 by still using the canonical coordinates .",
    "now the integrand is written as the `` @xmath58 '' component of the infinitesimal covariant four - vector @xmath95 but of course in general the expression @xmath96 will not be a four - vector , because the integration over @xmath92 spoils the covariance . when evaluated in canonical coordinates ,",
    "the nonvanishing components of @xmath88 are @xmath97 and @xmath98 that however must vanish too , if @xmath88 has to become a four - vector defined on the symmetry axis .",
    "but , as one sees from weyl s analysis , we are at freedom to choose @xmath49 in @xmath67 as nonvanishing only in a tube with a very small   yet finite coordinate radius that encloses in its interior the segment of the symmetry axis lying between the bodies ; moreover , we can freely set @xmath99 within the tube . under these conditions",
    "the second term of the integral ( [ 4.5 ] ) just vanishes , while the first one shall be very small , since the regularity of the surface @xmath92 requires that the curve @xmath73 approach the symmetry axis at a straight angle in canonical coordinates . by properly choosing @xmath49",
    "we thus succeed in providing through equation ( [ 4.4 ] ) a quasi four - vector @xmath88 whose components , written in weyl s canonical coordinates , reduce in approximation to @xmath100 .",
    "having defined , with the above caveats , the quasi four - vector @xmath88 along the segment of the symmetry axis between the two bodies , we can use its `` quasi '' norm to provide a measure of the force that opposes the gravitational pull . in the case of bach s two - body solution ,",
    "whose line element is defined in canonical coordinates by ( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.11 ] ) , that quasi norm reads @xmath102^{1/2}\\ ] ] when measured in weyl s units at a point of the symmetry axis for which @xmath103 . at variance with the behaviour of @xmath50 , the quasi norm @xmath104 depends on @xmath10 , due to the term of ( [ 5.1 ] ) enclosed within the square brackets , that comes from @xmath105 .",
    "let us evaluate this quasi norm divided by @xmath1 when @xmath2 , namely , the coefficient of the linear term in the mclaurin series expansion of @xmath104 with respect to @xmath1 . since @xmath81 , now defined by the right hand side of ( [ 2.12 ] ) , tends to zero when @xmath2 , while performing this limit one can also send to zero the radius of the very narrow tube considered in the previous section .",
    "therefore @xmath88 can become a true four - vector and @xmath104 can become a true norm in the above mentioned limit . with this proviso one finds the invariant result @xmath106 = \\left[\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial l'}\\right]_{l'=0 } = \\frac{2\\pi l}{d(d+l)}\\left(\\frac{r_1 - 2l}{r_1}\\right)^{1/2}.\\ ] ]",
    "when @xmath2 the line element of bach s solution with two bodies tends to the line element defined by ( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.5 ] ) , that is in one - to - one correspondence with the line element of schwarzschild s original solution @xcite .",
    "therefore the scalar quantity @xmath107_{l'=0}$ ] evaluated at @xmath108 shall be the norm of the force per unit mass exerted by schwarzschild s gravitational field on a test particle kept at rest at @xmath108 .",
    "its value is obtained by substituting @xmath109 for @xmath18 in ( [ 5.2 ] ) .",
    "one finds @xmath110\\right)_{z = z_3 } = \\frac{8\\pi l}{(2d+2l)^{3/2}(2d)^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] if one solves schwarzschild s problem in spherical polar coordinates @xmath11 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 with three unknown functions of @xmath11 , _",
    "i.e. _ without fixing the radial coordinate , like combridge and janne did long ago @xcite,@xcite , one ends up to write de  sitter s line element @xcite @xmath114 + \\exp{\\nu}\\dd t^2\\ ] ] in terms of one unknown function @xmath115 .",
    "in fact @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 are defined through this arbitrary function @xmath115 and through its derivative @xmath119 as follows : @xmath120 here @xmath26 is the mass constant ; of course the arbitrary function @xmath121 must have the appropriate behaviour as @xmath122 .",
    "schwarzschild s original solution @xcite is eventually recovered @xcite,@xcite by requiring that @xmath121 be a monotonic function of @xmath11 and that @xmath123 .",
    "let us imagine that a test body be kept at rest in this field",
    ". with our symmetry - adapted coordinates , its world line shall be invariantly specified by requiring that the spatial coordinates @xmath11 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 of the test body be constant in time .",
    "if @xmath124 is the norm of the acceleration four - vector @xmath125 along the world line of the test body , one finds : @xmath126 this norm is assumed by way of hypothesis to be equal to the norm of the force per unit mass needed for constraining the test particle to follow a world line of rest despite the gravitational pull of the schwarzschild field @xcite .",
    "the consistency of the hypothesis with einstein s theory requires that @xmath127 be equal to the scalar quantity @xmath107_{l'=0,\\;z = z_3}$ ] that provides the norm of the force per unit mass for bach s solution in the test particle limit @xmath2 .",
    "this is indeed the case , since the functional dependence of ( [ 5.3 ] ) on the mass parameter @xmath0 and on the coordinate distance @xmath109 is the same as the functional dependence of ( [ 5.10 ] ) on the mass parameter @xmath26 and on the function @xmath115 with @xmath123 introduced above .",
    "the extra constant @xmath128 appearing in ( [ 5.3 ] ) is just due to weyl s adoption of the definition ( [ 3.1 ] ) of the energy tensor .    for schwarzschild s field , the definition of the norm of the force exerted on a test particle at rest obtained through the acceleration four - vector and the independent definition through the force that , in bach s two - body solution , @xmath49 must exert to keep the masses at rest when @xmath2 lead to one and the same result .",
    "in particular , both definitions show that the norm of the force per unit mass grows without limit as the test particle is kept at rest in a position closer and closer to schwarzschild s two - surface ."
