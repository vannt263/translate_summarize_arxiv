    "one of the most important frontier fields of cosmology is the evolution of the universe from the dark ages following hydrogen recombination through to the epoch of reionization .",
    "the 21-cm line associated with the hyperfine transition of atomic hydrogen is the most promising signal for detecting and mapping the spatial and redshift distribution of hydrogen in the universe , and for studying the sources responsible for heating and reionizing the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at redshifts @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , an important feature of the 21-cm signal is that the spectral dimension allows in principle 3d tomography of hydrogen as a function of redshift , providing much richer structure than the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , which yields just a single sky map ; this may help to detect primordial non - gaussianity and test inflation @xcite . during reionization ,",
    "detecting the bubble structure would probe the main sources of ionizing radiation , even if these are otherwise unobservable because , for example , they are too faint to be detected individually .",
    "it is also important to characterize when and how long the reionization took place , because of the significant effect of reionization on the subsequent formation of galaxies .",
    "in particular , the ultra - violet ( uv ) radiation heats the gas , raising the jeans mass and causing a suppression of star - forming galaxies in low - mass halos ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "a first estimate of the reionization redshift @xmath2 has been deduced from the cmb polarization , where an additional peak on large angular scales , corresponding to the horizon size at the reionization epoch , is expected due to scattering , with an amplitude related to the total optical depth .",
    "the recent analysis based on the 7-year wmap data @xcite finds a reionization redshift of @xmath3 , in terms of an equivalent instantaneous reionization , but is still consistent with a wide range of possible reionization histories .",
    "other constraints come from the ly@xmath4 galaxies at redshift 5.7 and 6.5 , whose characteristic luminosity function shows a lack of time evolution that is consistent with a fully ionized igm at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "analyses of the spectra of high - z qsos @xcite and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) @xcite also suggest that the igm is still very highly ionized at this redshift .",
    "the expected picture for reionization is thus an inhomogeneous and extended process , for which the nature and the evolution of the ionizing sources are still observationally undetermined .",
    "upcoming and future observational probes should allow us to distinguish among various reionization models and in particular constrain the possible extended or instantaneous nature of this process @xcite .",
    "low - frequency observations with radio telescope arrays such as lofar , mwa , paper , and ska , will over the next decade constrain the spatial distribution of the ionization sources , while dipole observations of the spatially - integrated 21-cm signal are currently underway , although in their infancy , as exemplified by edges @xcite .    recently",

    "3 we make predictions for the spatially - integrated 21-cm signal that experiments such as edges aim to measure .",
    "we compare the expected signal from the two models , and show some examples of the expected errors in the model parameters that are reconstructed from observations . in section  3.4 we explore the systematic effects of assuming an incorrect model when trying to reconstruct the global 21-cm signal .",
    "we finish this part with section  3.5 , which presents our main result , the detection limits of the global 21-cm signal .",
    "we summarize and discuss our conclusions in section  4 .",
    "hereafter we assume a flat @xmath6 cdm cosmology , with matter density parameter @xmath7 ( dark matter plus baryons ) , cosmological constant density parameter @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( hubble constant ) , @xmath10 ( baryons ) , @xmath11 ( power spectrum index ) and @xmath12 ( power spectrum normalization ) according to the latest 7-year wmap results @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we estimate all errors at the 68.3 percent confidence level .",
    "in general , a global 21-cm measurement yields the antenna temperature @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the foreground and cosmological 21-cm brightness temperatures , respectively . for the cosmic signal",
    ", we assume that the dipole antenna temperature essentially measures a sky average , since fluctuations are expected to be present only on angular scales that correspond to small fractions of the sky . the foregrounds ( i.e. , our galactic emission and radio emission from other galaxies ) have large - scale angular structure , but even if they are convolved with an angular dipole response , this does not affect our analysis , which only assumes that they are smooth as a function of frequency .    for the foreground brightness temperature @xmath16",
    ", we assume a polynomial fit of the form @xmath17 in particular , we use the third order polynomial fit from pl , who fitted the model of the sky put together by @xcite using all existing observations , by averaging the foregrounds over the dipole s angular response : @xmath18 ^ 2 \\\\ &   + a_3 [ \\log(\\nu/\\nu_0)]^3\\ ,   \\end{split}\\label{eq : tb2}\\ ] ] with parameter values @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , chosen from fitting to the band @xmath24 mhz .",
    "note that at these frequencies @xmath16 is dominated by diffuse synchrotron radiation from the galaxy .",
    "the residuals related to such a parameterization of the foreground are dominated by limitations of the adapted sky model @xcite and they are @xmath25 averaged over the band . while in principle higher order polynomials may be needed to reduce such residuals in the future , given the smoothness of the spectrum of the foreground , low order polynomials are key to avoid throwing the signal away with the foreground and to reduce the statistical errors (   [ datdd455 ] ) .    for the cosmic 21-cm signal ,",
    "the brightness temperature through the igm is @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the optical depth at @xmath28 cm produced by a patch of neutral hydrogen at the mean density and with a uniform 21-cm spin temperature @xmath29 , @xmath30 during the epoch of reionization the lyman-@xmath4 and x - ray radiation backgrounds are expected to be strong enough to bring the spin temperature @xmath29 to the gas temperature and heat the cosmic gas well above the cosmic microwave background temperature @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "the observed 21-cm brightness temperature @xmath31 relative to the cmb temperature @xmath32 is independent of @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , @xmath31 ( hereafter measured relative to @xmath33 ) is given by : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the neutral hydrogen fraction .",
    "note that the ionized fraction is @xmath37 . throughout this paper ,",
    "given that we are interested in the spatially - integrated 21-cm signal , we consider only the cosmic mean neutral or ionized fraction , and neglect spatial fluctuations in the 21-cm signal from density and peculiar velocity fluctuations .",
    "we consider an experiment covering the frequency range @xmath38 in 50 bins of bandwidth @xmath39 mhz for each of the receiver frequency channels , and integrating time @xmath40 hours ( these parameters mimic edges with an order of magnitude longer integration time ) . under these assumptions , the thermal noise in the @xmath41th receiver frequency channel",
    "is given by the radiometer equation : @xmath42 we note that the frequency range we consider corresponds to the redshift range 4.713.2 .",
    "our model thus consists of the foreground brightness temperature @xmath14 and a suitable model for the cosmological 21-cm signal @xmath15 . to derive the parameter errors ,",
    "we directly calculate the fisher matrix of the foreground plus 21-cm signal parameters @xmath43 expected with the above thermal noise @xmath44 , @xmath45 this equation provides an estimate of the covariance matrix @xmath46 , and therefore of the parameter uncertainty in dipole observations .",
    "note that this is equivalent to finding the covariance matrix near the minimum @xmath47 .",
    "these errors should be accurate as long as they are small .",
    "however , in many cases we consider regions of parameter space where the errors are large , e.g. , when we calculate the detection limit of an experiment , or more generally due to parameter degeneracies .",
    "thus , we often use a more generally - valid and computationally intensive monte - carlo ( mc ) error analysis .",
    "we generate a large number of mc simulations of the measurement noise , finding the best - fit parameters in each case by minimizing the @xmath47 : @xmath48 ^ 2\\ , \\label{chi2}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the difference between the measured and predicted total 21-cm sky temperature in channel @xmath50 ( centered at the frequency @xmath51 ) .",
    "the distribution of best - fit parameters in the mc trials yields parameter errors and their correlations .    in the following sections we will focus on the modeling of the 21-cm signal , in particular of the neutral fraction @xmath52 in equation  ( [ eq : tb34 ] ) .",
    "given the great uncertainty associated the evolution of the neutral fraction @xmath52 due to the uncertain astrophysics of the ionizing sources , we will begin with a toy model , namely the _",
    "tanh_-based parameterization used by previous authors , which simply characterizes when and for how long the reionization occurs ; then we will consider a more complex and physically motivated structure formation model , in order to better describe the reionization process and extract interesting astrophysical information , such as the mass of the smallest galaxies that can form and contribute to the igm ionization , the overall number of ionizations per baryon and the redshift evolution of the ionizing sources .",
    "the _ tanh_-based parameterization is characterized by two parameters describing the two main features of reionization : its mid - point @xmath2 and duration @xmath53 .",
    "this approach was used by pl for the 21-cm signal ( note that @xcite used a somewhat different parameterization ) , and a similar _ tanh_-based fitting function is the default parameterization of reionization in camb ( although there it is based on the optical depth for cmb scattering ) @xcite . under the assumptions outlined above for the gas state during reionization ,",

    "\\ ] ] note that @xmath2 is the redshift at which the ionized fraction @xmath55 , while @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the redshifts at which @xmath58 and 88.1% , respectively .",
    "this parameterization is a convenient mathematical toy model but it does not have any particular physical motivation .",
    "we consider both the case where we fix the amplitude of the signal @xmath59 to its known value ( equation  [ eq : tb34 ] ) , and the case where we leave it as a free parameter ( following pl ) .      in the previous section we considered a toy model that has been used in previous observational and theoretical papers .",
    "while a toy model can be justified as an unbiased analysis tool , especially given the large current uncertainty in the astrophysics of high - redshift galaxies , such an approach is also problematic .",
    "the particular model assumed ( with a fixed , arbitrarily - chosen shape ) may lead to systematically biased results if it can not reasonably approximate the real reionization ( we consider this issue further below ) .",
    "in addition , it can be hard to interpret any results of a toy model in terms of the underlying parameters of interest .",
    "in particular , the redshift evolution of reionization is closely related to structure formation .",
    "indeed , reionization is driven by the intergalactic ionizing radiation field , which ( we expect ) is the result of the ionizing radiation escaping from stars and quasars within galaxies .",
    "while astrophysical aspects ( such as star formation and feedback ) play a significant role , the evolution of galaxies is driven by the properties of the host dark matter halos .",
    "a major reason for studying reionization is to learn more about both galaxy formation and the astrophysical properties of galaxies in the reionization era .",
    "thus , a more realistic and useful approach is to use models based on our understanding of cdm - driven galaxy and structure formation , a model with many successes at lower redshifts , and to include some flexibility in order to account for the uncertain astrophysical parameters .",
    "here we take the first step in this process by using a simple model that is based on the standard theory of galaxy formation .",
    "we begin with the equation from @xcite , based on @xcite , that statistically describes the transition from a neutral universe to a fully ionized one ; in particular this equation describes the evolution of the @xmath60 filling factor @xmath61 , i.e. , the fraction of the volume of the universe which is filled by @xmath60 regions .",
    "@xmath62 assuming a primordial mass fraction of hydrogen of 0.76 . in this equation @xmath63 is an efficiency parameter that gives the overall number of ionizing photons per baryon ; for instance , if we assume that baryons are incorporated into stars with an efficiency of @xmath64 , the escape fraction for the resulting ionizing radiation is @xmath65 and @xmath66 ionizing photons are produced per baryon in stars ( for a stellar imf similar to the one measured locally but with a metallicity equal to @xmath67 of the solar value ) , we infer that for every baryon in galaxies @xmath6820 escaping ionizing photons are produced by stars .",
    "we obtain a similar result if we consider mini - quasars rather than stars @xcite .",
    "it is possible to get a substantially higher @xmath69 using pop iii stars or by assuming a high escape fraction .",
    "@xmath69 also determines the maximum comoving radius of the region that a halo of mass @xmath70 can ionize on its own ( neglecting recombinations ) , @xmath71 a radius that is larger than the halo virial radius by a factor of @xmath72 ( essentially independent of redshift and halo mass ) .    also in equation  ( [ qiieqn ] ) , @xmath73 is the scale factor , @xmath74 is the present number density of hydrogen , @xmath75 is the case b recombination coefficient of hydrogen , and @xmath76 represents the volume - averaged clumping factor ( in general time - dependent ) , @xmath77 this factor crudely accounts for a non - uniform igm that includes high - density clumps .",
    "since each ionized bubble is far larger than the typical scale of clumping , so that many clumps are averaged over , @xmath76 can be assumed to be approximately spatially uniform .",
    "the collapsed fraction @xmath78 is the fraction of all the baryons in the universe that is in galaxies , i.e. , the fraction of gas which settles into halos and cools efficiently inside them .",
    "a simple estimate of the collapse fraction at high redshift is the halo mass fraction above some cooling threshold .",
    "more generally , we include halos above some minimum circular velocity @xmath79 .",
    "we use the sheth - tormen halo mass function , which accurately fits the mean halo abundance in simulations @xcite .",
    "we calculate the power spectrum transfer function using the _ camb _ code @xcite .",
    "the solution of equation  ( [ qiieqn ] ) is @xcite @xmath80 where ( if @xmath76 is time - independent ) @xmath81\\ , \\ ] ] and where ( in flat @xmath6cdm ) @xmath82 once @xmath83 reaches unity , the universe becomes fully reionized and remains so within our model .",
    "equation  ( [ sol1 ] ) allows us to quickly calculate the time evolution of the ionized fraction of the universe once we fix the igm clumping factor and the parameters related to the ionizing sources .",
    "also , in equation  ( [ fisher1 ] ) we calculate accurate derivatives for the 21-cm signal as numerical integrals of partial derivatives of the integrand in equation  ( [ sol1 ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this cdm - dominated galaxy formation model as the cdm model .    within the cdm model ,",
    "the parameters that determine the redshift evolution of @xmath84 ( and @xmath31 ) are @xmath69 ( which we assume is a constant , in this first investigation of fitting global 21-cm signals from a galaxy formation model ) , c ( likewise assumed constant ) , and the minimum halo circular velocity @xmath79 ( equivalent to a minimum mass ) required for halos that host galaxies .",
    "we allow @xmath79 to vary , since while cooling sets a minimum value for it , feedback ( radiative or from supernovae ) may in reality set a higher threshold for effective star formation .",
    "we set @xmath85 as our standard value ( i.e. , corresponding to a uniform igm ) , and discuss in several cases the effect of allowing @xmath76 to vary .",
    "we begin by visually comparing our two models , the _ tanh_-based toy model and the more realistic cdm - based model . in figure  [ entps3xc ]",
    "we plot a few examples of the global ( volume - averaged ) 21-cm signal for each model , over the assumed experimental frequency range ( 100250 mhz ) . for the cdm model",
    ", we consider a minimum halo circular velocity @xmath86 km / s , corresponding to a midpoint of reionization @xmath87 and a minimum galactic halo of @xmath88 at @xmath89 , with the other parameters fixed at @xmath90 and @xmath85 .",
    "the two lower values of @xmath79 correspond to cooling via molecular hydrogen and via atomic hydrogen and helium , respectively , while the higher values are roughly in the range of values possible due to photoheating or supernova feedback .",
    "in general , a higher circular velocity implies that only more massive halos are included , delaying reionization to a lower redshift ( for a fixed @xmath91 ) .",
    "in addition , since more massive halos are more rare and correspond to the gaussian tail of large ( positive ) density fluctuations , their abundance changes rapidly with time , thus making reionization more rapid in terms of its redshift extent ; this would be obvious in a comparison of models all normalized to the same @xmath2 , while the effect is suppressed in this figure since the lower redshifts are stretched into a relatively large frequency interval .",
    "the main point is that @xmath2 is determined by a combination of @xmath79 and @xmath69 , while the extent of reionization is separately sensitive to @xmath79 , so that a measurement of the reionization history can probe both the characteristic halo mass of the ionizing sources and their ionizing efficiency .",
    "the main qualitative difference between the two models is that the cdm model shows a steady rise of @xmath84 , while the toy model is much more round in shape , in particular showing a slowdown of reionization during its last quarter or so .",
    "the toy model is explicitly symmetric in redshift about the midpoint of reionization , while in the cdm model reionization starts slowly but ends quickly .",
    "the steady acceleration of reionization in the cdm model is driven by the exponential rise of the ionizing sources , which correspond to rare halos at these redshifts . however , our simple model is by no means fully general , so we treat our conclusions with caution , as discussed further below .",
    "we consider the cdm model to be an example of a realistic model , which may be quantitatively plausible if some of the missing complications turn out to have a relatively minor effect on the global 21-cm signal .",
    "we note , however , that some complications may tend to make the cdm model more similar in shape to the tanh model ( see sect .",
    "the _ tanh_-based model is explicitly expressed in terms of the mid - point @xmath2 and duration @xmath53 of reionization , while in the cdm model these are derived parameters . while the midpoint @xmath2 is naturally defined as @xmath92 , there is some ambiguity in @xmath53 .",
    "for the toy model , we have chosen to follow previous pl in defining @xmath53 as above , a definition that is natural for the _ tanh _ function , and implies that @xmath56 and @xmath93 ( i.e. , a total spread of @xmath94 ) delineate the central 76.2% of reionization .",
    "however , for the cdm model we use a definition that should be the natural one more generally : @xmath95 , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 being the redshifts corresponding to @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "thus , in the cdm model a spread of @xmath94 marks the central @xmath100 . in the context of the _ tanh _ model , this definition would give a value of @xmath53 smaller by a factor of 1.2 than the definition that we have followed .    in order to gain intuition on how the characteristics of reionization are set in the cdm model , in figure  [ ent246e ]",
    "we show the dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath53 on @xmath69 for one value of @xmath79 and several values of @xmath76 .",
    "larger values of @xmath69 lead to earlier reionization ( i.e. , higher @xmath2 ) at a time when the ionizing sources are brighter and rarer , so their rarity leads to a shorter span @xmath53 for reionization .",
    "we compare @xmath85 to no recombinations @xmath101 and fast recombinations ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "at least during most of reionization @xmath76 is likely to be of order unity , since the low - density igm gets reionized first , and the denser gas is left for the final stages of reionization .",
    "we find that a high clumping factor can be essentially counterbalanced by a higher value of @xmath69 , at least during the central portion of reionization that defines @xmath2 and @xmath53 , so that including @xmath76 as a free parameter mostly includes the degeneracy of the parameters but does not significantly change the allowed parameter space of @xmath2 and @xmath53 .",
    "a more complete picture of the allowed parameter space is shown in figure  [ ent2rt2 ] , where we present the isocontours of @xmath2 and @xmath53 in the @xmath69-@xmath79 plane . for reasonable values of @xmath69 and",
    "@xmath79 the reionization midpoint @xmath2 varies widely ( from below 6 to above 18 ) , while the span of reionization @xmath53 covers roughly the range 13 . as noted above , these values of @xmath103",
    "should be multiplied by a factor of 1.2 for a fair comparison with @xmath53 in the _ tanh _ model .",
    "we now derive parameter errors for some specific instances of potential global 21-cm observations .",
    "we begin with the _ tanh _ model , and test the fisher matrix formalism against the mc error analysis .",
    "taking fiducial values of @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and assuming the model parameters for the foreground as in   [ datdd24 ] , we generate @xmath106 mc simulations of the noise , finding the best fit parameters in each case .",
    "the resulting parameter contours are shown in figure  [ ent2rr ] along with the corresponding fisher matrix constraints .",
    "we find good agreement between the two methods in this example .",
    "we consider both the case where @xmath59 is a free parameter ( as assumed by pl ) and where it is fixed at its known value .",
    "the error ellipses show that there is a strong positive correlation between @xmath59 and @xmath53 , i.e. , there is an uncertainty in distinguishing between a higher amplitude extended scenario and a lower amplitude quicker scenario , since both produce a similar slope with frequency in the 21-cm signal , and it is this sharp slope that can be distinguished from the foregrounds ( which are smooth and thus can be modeled by a low - order polynomial ) .",
    "there are also significant correlations among the other parameters . comparing with pl",
    ", we note that the amplitude of the errors that we find are smaller in all four panels , and also the sign of the correlation is different in the @xmath107 and @xmath57 relations . note that pl used a different frequency interval , i.e. @xmath108 ( pritchard & loeb , personal communication ) .",
    "the results thus show significant correlations among the parameters when @xmath59 is free , but substantially reduced errors and correlations when @xmath59 is fixed .",
    "we conclude that it is possible to obtain a direct observational estimate for @xmath59 from these type of data , in order to check consistency with the theoretically expected value , but in order to constrain reionization it is very helpful to use our independent knowledge of @xmath59 . in this example",
    "we have assumed an integration time @xmath40 and fitted a foreground polynomial of degree @xmath109 over the entire frequency range , assuming no remaining foreground or systematic residuals .",
    "this represents a quite optimistic assumption regarding the level of systematic noise and the ease of foreground removal , far beyond the current edges experiment , as discussed further below .",
    "since we have just considered a rather optimistic experimental scenario , it is interesting to consider more realistic possibilities .",
    "one way to do this is to vary the integration time , thus increasing the errors .",
    "we can take this also as a rough indication of the effect of increasing the foreground or systematic residuals to various levels ( still with @xmath109 ) . in the case considered in figure",
    "[ ent2rr ] , the errors per frequency bin range from 0.4 mk in the lowest - frequency bin to an order of magnitude lower at the highest - frequency bin .",
    "more generally , the noise varies with the integration time @xmath110 of the bolometer as @xmath111 [ equation  ( [ eq : tb34ee ] ) ] . in figure  [ ent245 ]",
    "we consider the fractional error on @xmath2 as a function of @xmath110 for @xmath112 and @xmath104 .",
    "note that the fractional error in @xmath2 varies approximately as @xmath113 since the errors are relatively small over most of the plotted range ( which makes the model behave approximately like a linear model ) .",
    "more extended reionization scenarios increase the errors significantly .",
    "fixing @xmath59 at its known value reduces the errors by @xmath114",
    ".    we will directly consider detection limits in a later section , but one way to define a successful detection of reionization is when observations yield a meaningful constraint on the most interesting single number associated with reionization , namely @xmath2 . within the _ tanh _ model , rough ( @xmath115 ) constraints on @xmath2",
    "are expected for @xmath116 hours ( if @xmath117 ) or 1.9 hours ( if @xmath118 ) , while tight ( @xmath119 ) constraints require @xmath120 hours ( if @xmath117 ) , 51 hours ( if @xmath118 ) , or 3.1 hours ( for sharper reionization , with @xmath105 ) .    in figure  [ ent246 ]",

    "fixing @xmath59 at its known value can make a big difference ( compared to allowing it to be a free parameter ) , especially in constraining @xmath53 ( except when all the errors are large , for high @xmath53 ) .",
    "the relative errors vary weakly with @xmath2 over the range of 610 ( a range which is all well within our assumed experimental frequency window ) .",
    "we begin our exploration of global 21-cm measurements in the context of the cdm model with figure  [ ent2 ] , where we show parameter errors and correlations for the fiducial values of @xmath122 for @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "the error ellipses show that there is a strong positive correlation between @xmath79 and @xmath91 ; indeed , this is a partial degeneracy , since while the error ellipse covers a small total area , each of these parameters is uncertain at a relatively high ( @xmath124 ) level . from figure  [ ent2rt2 ]",
    "it is apparent that this degeneracy with a positive correlation is driven by the value of @xmath2 , which is the main constraint from these observations ( at least in the example we are considering of a high - precision experiment with low noise ) .",
    "there is also a strong anti - correlation between @xmath79 and @xmath125 , demonstrating how the foreground fitting removes power from the total signal @xmath126 making it more difficult to determine the parameters of reionization .",
    "the fisher matrix and mc formalisms yield a reasonable agreement , but there are bigger differences compared to the _ tanh _ model , likely because the partial degeneracy gives larger errors in some directions in the cdm model .",
    "fortunately , the partial degeneracy in the parameters of the cdm model is relatively harmless in terms of measuring the characteristics of reionization . for the case considered in figure  [ ent2 ]",

    "the fit of the _ tanh_-based model + foregrounds , after the subtraction of the best - fit foreground polynomial ( which takes out part of the signal together with the original input foreground ) , leads to a quite different output profile of @xmath15 compared to the input one , and to biased values of the midpoint and duration of reionization .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath136 and @xmath137 ; the latter is even more discrepant than may appear , because the input cdm value of @xmath53 should be multiplied by 1.2 for a fair comparison with the _ tanh _ model . while the statistical errors of the fit are tiny ( for @xmath138 hours and @xmath109 ) , the systematic errors are quite large .",
    "the systematic errors are related both to the inadequacy of the _ tanh _ model in representing the reionization signal and to the presence of the foreground which must be fit with a polynomial .    the news , though , is not all bad , since an experiment with such low noise levels would result in high , strongly discrepant , @xmath47 values for such a poor fit , giving a clear indication that the template being used must , indeed , be modified .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath139 for 44 degrees of freedom .",
    "this means that in this example , only a much reduced experimental sensitivity corresponding to @xmath140 hours would give a reduced @xmath47 of order unity for the _ tanh _ model fit .",
    "any experiment above this sensitivity would be able to discriminate between the cdm and _ tanh _ models .",
    "in figure  [ zahn2007c ] we explore these kind of systematic errors over a wider range of the parameter space .",
    "we compare the best - fit parameters @xmath2 and @xmath53 from fitting the _ tanh _ model + foreground with the true values for an input cdm model of reionization .",
    "we fix the input @xmath141 ( equivalent to @xmath142 in the _ tanh _ model ) , and vary @xmath2 over the range 610 .",
    "this wider range shows similar results to the example above , where the best - fit @xmath2 in the _ tanh _ model is underestimated typically by 510% , while @xmath53 is underestimated by much more .",
    "we consider several different values of the assumed clumping factor in the cdm model , and find that the @xmath101 and @xmath85 curves lie on top of each other , while @xmath102 is only slightly different ( where the comparison is made with fixed @xmath2 and @xmath53 values in the input cdm model ) .      in this section",
    "we present our main result , i.e. , the experimental sensitivity that is required to detect the global 21-cm signal , as predicted by each of the reionization models .",
    "a range of different results is summarized in figure  [ ent246 g ] .",
    "first we display the full range of allowed values of the midpoint and span of reionization within the cdm model ( gray shaded region ) , where the parameters ( @xmath143 ) are allowed to vary over @xmath144 and @xmath145 km / s , fixing @xmath85 .",
    "this region reflects figure  [ ent2rt2 ] , showing that a wide range of @xmath2 is plausible , while the most relevant range of @xmath146 includes some models with @xmath53 as low as @xmath147 .",
    "the figure also shows curves which delineate the 95% detection region for the different reionization models , for various polynomial orders of the fit ( @xmath148 in equation [ eq : tb2y ] ) , and several possible values of the integration time @xmath110 .",
    "we define a model as detected if it is inconsistent with a fit that does not include the reionization signal .",
    "thus , we fit each model signal with a foreground polynomial of a particular @xmath149 , and if the resulting minimum @xmath47 is inconsistent with zero at greater than 95% confidence , than that model is included within the detection region . for the cdm model ,",
    "the unrealistic sudden end to reionization raises the @xmath47 values somewhat , so we reduce our sensitivity to this by removing from the @xmath47 value the contribution of the 12 mhz band centered on the end of reionization for each model .",
    "for both models there are some oscillations in the detection limit curves due to the degeneracy between the 21-cm signal and the polynomial fitting of the foreground .    for the _ tanh _ model , for the same case as pl ( @xmath40 hours )",
    "we find significantly better prospects for detectability , with our limits on @xmath53 for a given @xmath2 typically higher by a factor of @xmath150 than their result .",
    "it is possible to constrain some models with @xmath151 even with @xmath152 hours , if @xmath109 suffices for removing the foreground and other systematics , or with @xmath40 hours if @xmath153 .",
    "the worst case of @xmath154 only allows the detection ( or ruling out ) of very sharp reionization models that are probably unrealistic .",
    "our cdm model gives comparable constraints to the _ tanh _ model for low values of @xmath155 , but it is significantly more detectable with higher - order polynomials . the rapid rise of reionization up until its sharp end is easier to distinguish from a high - order polynomial compared with the smooth _ tanh _ model , even after the removal ( in the cdm case ) of the frequency interval right near the end of reionization .",
    "we thus find that an interesting parameter space of cdm models can be detected even with @xmath154 , for integration times of at least @xmath156 hours .",
    "we have not tried to indicate current constraints on reionization in in figure  [ ent246 g ] , to avoid overcrowding the figure , especially since these constraints are not directly expressed in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath53 , and the conversion to these variables would differ somewhat between the _ tanh _ and cdm models .",
    "roughly , for these models , the 7-year wmap data implies a 95% limit of @xmath157 , while the absorption constraints that show a high ionization fraction at @xmath158 imply a minimum @xmath2 that increases beyond 8 if @xmath159 ( see also the introduction and the discussion in pl ) .",
    "the relation between these constraints on reionization and those from global 21-cm measurements would change for more complex models of reionization .",
    "the aim of this paper was to investigate the possibility that global 21-cm observations during the epoch of reionization can probe the evolution of the igm and the physical properties of the ionizing sources . detecting the 21-cm signal in the presence of the large foregrounds is challenging and it is important to explore all avenues .",
    "while interferometric radio arrays are gearing up to measure 21-cm fluctuations , global measurements with a single dipole experiment can provide an independent and complementary method for detecting and/or constraining reionization .    in order to derive quantitative predictions ,",
    "we have implemented both a previously - used toy model and a more realistic and physically - motivated model for reionization .",
    "the first one , the _ tanh _ model , is expressed in terms of two parameters , namely the two main characteristics of the overall reionization process , its midpoint @xmath2 and span @xmath53 ; the particular form of the model is merely mathematically convenient , with no real physical significance , and it restricts reionization to be smooth and symmetric about its midpoint .",
    "the second model , the cdm model , is based on the standard understanding of galaxy formation within cdm - dominated halos .",
    "it assumes a fixed overall ionizing efficiency @xmath69 ( number of ionizing photons per baryon ) , a density clumping factor @xmath76 and a minimum halo circular velocity @xmath160 for galactic halos , and it yields reionization models with up to 3 parameters ( @xmath76 is relatively minor and we typically held it fixed in the fitting ) . unlike the _ tanh _ model , the cdm model is asymmetric , with the exponentially increasing halo abundance leading to an acceleration of reionization in its later stages .",
    "despite the fact that the _ tanh _ model is a simple parameterization that has often been used in the literature , we have shown that it leads to substantial systematic errors if it is assumed when fitting a 21-cm signal that is described by the cdm model .",
    "in particular , the best - fit @xmath2 in the _ tanh _ model is underestimated typically by 510% , while @xmath53 is underestimated by tens of percent . however",
    ", a sufficiently sensitive experiment ( e.g. , with an integration time @xmath161 hours for the case of a foreground polynomial of degree @xmath109 ) would be able to discriminate between the cdm and _ tanh _ models based on the @xmath47 value of the best - fit model .",
    "our main result is a detailed plot of the detection limits of global 21-cm experiments ( figure  [ ent246 g ] ) .",
    "we find that the cdm model can produce quick reionization scenarios ( with a redshift span @xmath162 ) if feedback makes large halos dominate , which then requires a high ionizing efficiency in these halos ( see also figure  [ ent2rt2 ] ) .",
    "some of these realistically possible models can be ruled out with 50-hour global 21-cm experiments even in the pessimistic case where a polynomial of degree @xmath154 is required for removing the foregrounds ( or other systematic effects ) .",
    "if somewhat more ambitions experiments are achievable , then a broad range of scenarios up to @xmath163 can be probed within our cdm model .",
    "the smooth and symmetric _ tanh _ model is more difficult to differentiate from the foreground polynomial , and it requires greater integration times and lower @xmath155 in order to rule out for similar reionization characteristics .",
    "our conclusions are generally optimistic in terms of the possibility for global 21-cm experiments to reconstructing the reionization history and constrain the properties of the ionizing sources . in particular , one - year edges observations may allow a remarkably precise reconstruction",
    ". however , the polynomial degree @xmath155 that is required for removing the foreground and systematic effects plays an important role . in the most optimistic case , where @xmath109 suffices over the entire frequency range of 100250 mhz ,",
    "@xmath119 errors on @xmath2 are achievable ; they require @xmath164 hours with the _ tanh _ model or 29 hours with the cdm model ( in each case with @xmath118 as defined in that model ) .",
    "these , of course , are only statistical errors , while we have shown that there can be much larger systematic errors if the assumed reionization model can not reproduce the real 21-cm signal from reionization .    indeed , our results merit some caution , since our investigation indicates that a broader range of flexible and realistic models of reionization should be studied before we can be confident that the results are robust . for instance , the parameters of the model ( @xmath91 , @xmath79 , and @xmath76 ) could change with redshift due to evolving feedbacks such as metal enrichment or the effect of photoheating on suppressing gas accretion onto galaxies in the reionized regions ( this effect is large if reionization is initially dominated by relatively small halos ) .",
    "such an evolution could , e.g. , be parameterized as in @xcite ; while such a complication of the model would no doubt lead to serious partial degeneracies among the parameters , hopefully the main characteristics of reionization would remain measurable at high accuracy .",
    "another possible complication that could be added is the increasing effect of recombinations near the end of reionization due to the optical depth of dense clumps within the then - large @xmath60 bubbles @xcite .",
    "we note that some of these effects , such as the feedback and the increasing recombinations , should slow the progress of reionization as it nears its end , thus rounding the shape of the cdm model and perhaps reaching a result that is more similar to the tanh model .",
    "we plan to study these more realistic models .",
    "we note that in the radiometer equation we neglected the effects of the instrumental response ( or bandpass ) on both the foreground and the cosmological signal ( i.e. , we assumed a flat bandpass filter ) .",
    "indeed , in a real observation this would raise three issues , but it should be possible to deal with them ( judd bowman , personal communication ) .",
    "first , our theoretical model must be convolved with the instrumental response , in order to compare to the observations .",
    "this can be done if the bandpass is known with sufficient accuracy ( @xmath681% in current experiments and expected to improve ) .",
    "the foregrounds must also be convolved with the response , but as long the instrumental response is smooth , i.e. , does not introduce sharp frequency features , the foregrounds can still be removed by low - order polynomial fitting . finally , another effect of a less than perfect response is a decrease of the sensitivity of the observation with respect to a flat receiver response .",
    "we can simply compensate for this effect by slightly increasing the observing time ( by a few tens of percent for current experiments ) .",
    "recently , @xcite reported substantial new results from their upgraded edges experiment . taking only the cleanest data out of their observational run",
    ", they had a thermal noise level equivalent to @xmath165 hour ( with our idealized assumptions ) within their 100 - 200 mhz band .",
    "they also found it necessary to use @xmath166 in order to remove the foreground and systematics , and reach the thermal noise level , within 20 mhz sub - bands in their spectrum .",
    "this is still somewhat worse than even our conservative @xmath154 case over the full 100 - 250 mhz range . even with these limitations",
    ", @xcite reached an observational milestone , namely the first direct observational limit on the rapidity of cosmic reionization .",
    "in particular , using the _ tanh _ model , they set a 95% confidence lower limit of @xmath167 for the duration of the reionization epoch .",
    "global 21-cm experiments are still in their infancy and clearly have a quite promising future .",
