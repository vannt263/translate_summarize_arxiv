    "our proof of the @xmath0-analog proceeds very closely to the history just outlined .",
    "besides the @xmath0-analog of babbage s congruence we will employ @xmath0-analogs of wolstenholme s harmonic congruences and which were recently supplied by shi and pan , @xcite :    [ thm : shipan ] for primes @xmath3 , @xmath31_q } \\equiv - \\frac{p - 1}{2 } ( q      - 1 ) + \\frac{p^2 - 1}{24 } ( q - 1)^2 [ p]_q { \\hspace{1em } { \\ensuremath{\\operatorname{mod } } } { { \\ensuremath{\\left [ { p } \\right]_{q}}}^2}}\\ ] ] as well as @xmath32_q^2 } \\equiv - \\frac{(p - 1 ) ( p      - 5)}{12 } ( q - 1)^2 { \\hspace{1em } { \\ensuremath{\\operatorname{mod } } } { { \\ensuremath{\\left [ { p } \\right]_{q}}}}}.\\ ] ]    this generalizes an earlier result @xcite of andrews .",
    "in the classical case , the typical proof of ljunggren s congruence starts with the chu - vandermonde identity which has the following well - known @xmath0-analog :    [ thm : qchu ] @xmath33    we are now in a position to prove the @xmath0-analog of .    as in @xcite",
