    "<S> we expect similar results , based on the observation that strong repulsive interactions govern the behaviors of the packings while attractions act as perturbations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the effective interaction of some widely studied soft colloidal particles ( e.g. , poly - n - isopropylacrylamide ) can be well fitted to the repulsions used here @xcite , our observations are also highly relevant to colloidal experiments , but the temperature effects should be also included . </S>",
    "<S> our preliminary results show that the transition from crystals to disordered crystals shifts continuously to lower values of the polydispersity with increasing temperature @xcite , because the thermal fluctuation is another factor in addition to the polydisopersity to induce frustrations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the athermal case discussed here is not singular from thermal systems and the physics can be generalized to thermal systems well below the melting temperature , which require further studies and verification of colloidal experiments .    </S>",
