    "the fine structure line of atomic carbon at 492 ghz ( 607 @xmath9 m ) is one of the important cooling lines of photon dominated regions ( pdrs ) .",
    "pdrs form the transition zones between the molecular interstellar medium ( ism ) and the atomic ism , where molecular gas is dissociated by ultraviolet photons from nearby star forming regions .",
    "maps of the distribution of [ ci ] emission in molecular clouds and on larger scales in nearby galaxies have revealed that it is often cospatial with the emission from co ( e.g. , keene et al .",
    "1985 ; israel , white & baas 1995 ) , despite the fact that the ionization energy of carbon is very close to the photodissociation energy of co. from these energy considerations , [ ci ] would be expected to exist only in a thin layer at the surface of molecular clouds .",
    "the similarity between the spatial distributions of co and [ ci ] is evidence for a clumpy molecular ism that allows ultraviolet photons to penetrate into the interiors of molecular clouds ( white & padman 1991 ) .",
    "the ratio of atomic carbon to co , n(c)/n(co ) , depends on which chemical reactions occur in the pdr , which in turn depends upon the degree of ionization of the gas . when the ionization fraction exceeds a critical value , the gas phase chemistry is dominated by charge transfer reactions with h@xmath10 .",
    "these reactions suppress the amount of h@xmath11 , the most important species for reactions that destroy atomic carbon .",
    "thus , at high ionization fractions , the abundance of c can remain high , while at lower ionization fractions h@xmath11 reactions dominate and c is destroyed ( graedel , langer & frerking et al .",
    "1982 ; flower et al .",
    "both uv photons and cosmic rays can influence the ionization fraction . a strong uv field incident upon a molecular cloud",
    "will eventually be stopped by the increasing optical depth as the radiation penetrates the cloud .",
    "thus , the distribution of [ ci ] emission should appear asymmetric .",
    "the flux of energetic cosmic rays , on the other hand , will be isotropic within a galaxy and the cosmic rays will be capable of penetrating the entire molecular cloud . if the cosmic rays are a more important source of ionization than the uv flux , the [ ci ] distribution should appear similar to the co distribution , with both species tracing the overall distribution of carbon in the ism .",
    "we present observations of the [ ci ] line at 492 ghz of the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) ngc604 - 2 , in the giant hii region ngc604 , which is in the local group galaxy m33 . by observing a gmc in a nearby galaxy ( d = 0.84 mpc ; freedman , wilson , & madore 1991 ) , we can map the extent of the cloud in a comparatively short time , and thus determine the spatial distribution of the [ ci ] emission .",
    "ngc604 - 2 has a molecular mass of @xmath12 m@xmath13 , a diameter of @xmath4 32 pc , and a linewidth of @xmath4 11 ( wilson & scoville 1992 ) .",
    "it is similar to the larger gmcs in the milky way galaxy .",
    "ngc604 is the most luminous hii region in m33 , and is the second nearest giant hii region , the nearest being 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "although these two hii regions are comparable in size , the h@xmath14 luminosity of ngc604 is approximately half that of 30 doradus ( kennicutt 1984 ) .",
    "the most important difference between the two regions is the distribution of their ionizing stars : 30 doradus is dominated by the r136 cluster ( walborn 1991 ) , while in ngc604 the distribution of massive stars is not so concentrated towards the center of the hii region ( drissen et al .",
    "hunter et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have calculated the average density of o stars in ngc 604 to be 0.0018 stars pc@xmath15 , 100 times lower than in r136 and more than a factor of 2 lower than the average density over the entire 30 doradus region .",
    "we observed the gmc ngc604 - 2 in the @xmath16 transition of [ ci ] at 492.2 ghz using the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea during 1997 november 21 - 22 , 1997 december 12 , 1998 december 27 and 1999 july 28 .",
    "the half power beam width at this frequency is 12 , so a map was constructed using a grid with 5  spacing .",
    "the axes of this grid are rotated 45@xmath17  with respect to the equatorial coordinate system .",
    "calibration observations of w75n and w3(oh ) differed from the standard jcmt reference spectra by 20% on 21 november , and by 5% on the other dates , so we adopt as the uncertainty in the absolute calibration a factor of 20% .",
    "these reference spectra are available on the .",
    "the pointing was checked every 1 to 2 hours by observing the planets mars , jupiter , and uranus , and the source ngc  7538 irs 1 .",
    "the pointing of the telescope drifted during the observations , requiring us to correct for this drift . immediately after a pointing check the pointing accuracy was 1  or better , small compared to the beam size . after 1 or 2 hours , the drifting resulted in offsets relative to the intended position that were a significant fraction of the beam . on 1997",
    "november 21 , the maximum drift rate measured was 1  per hour , while on november 22 the drift reached 1.5  per hour , and on december 12 1.7  per hour . for observations taken more than an hour after a pointing check , a correction was applied in the data reduction stage .",
    "the altitude - azimuth coordinate system in which pointing is checked rotates with respect to equatorial coordinates through the night , so a systematic drift in alt - az coordinates does not correspond to a constant offset in position in equatorial coordinates .",
    "a log of the observed positions , the applied pointing corrections in equatorial coordinates , and the rms noise for the final spectra is given in table  1 .",
    "[ table1 ]    the data reduction was carried out using the specx package to subtract a linear baseline from each spectrum and average together spectra taken at the same position .",

    "[ table2 ]    the central velocities of the [ ci ] line at each location are the same as for the co j=@xmath1 line , within the uncertainties . because of the agreement in central velocities of the two species , it is likely that the [ ci ] and co are associated .",

    "the possible gradient is most evident in the line running through the cloud from ( 0,-5 ) to ( 0,10 ) , where the line ratio increases towards the northwest edge of the cloud until the end of the cloud is reached .",
    "our observations do not prove the existence of the gradient , because the difference between positions ( 0,0 ) and ( 0,5 ) is roughly the same size as the error bars .",
    "such a gradient would be expected , however , due to the higher photodissociation rates at the edge of the cloud .",

    "it is reassuring that there is an agreement of a factor of three between these two calculations .",
    "the most obvious differences between the plume et al .",
    "clouds and ngc  604 - 2 are that ngc  604 - 2 is in a giant hii region , rather than a small hii region , and that ngc  604 - 2 is more metal poor than the hii region of plume et al .",
    "stronger dissociating radiation could lead to enhanced c creation through photodissociation .",
    "it is also possible that the lower metallicity of ngc  604 - 2 plays a role ; with less c , and therefore less co , the self shielding of co against dissociating radiation will be lower , allowing a greater fraction of the existing co to be dissociated .",
    "of course , lower metallicity also means that the overall abundance of carbon will be lower , so it is not clear to what degree the enhanced photodissociation counters the lower metal abundance .",
    "there is a difference in the physical size of the clouds  the plume et al .",
    "clouds are @xmath4 10 pc in size , compared to @xmath4 30 pc for ngc  604 - 2 .",
    "perhaps differing n(c)/n(h@xmath6 ) ratios represent a difference in the distribution of gas in the clouds , with the smaller galactic clouds having lower column density , and hence allowing greater penetration by dissociating radiation .",
    "the models of flower et al .",
    "give n(c)/n(h@xmath6 ) ranging from @xmath4 10@xmath38 to 10@xmath39 .",
    "they can easily obtain values consistent with our observations , but the models have at least four free parameters , including the abundances of carbon and oxygen , the visual extinction , a@xmath40 , and degree of ionization . with observations of just [ ci ] and",
    "co we can not distinguish between their various models .",
    "the models of spaans & van dishoeck are more constrained because they attempt to model a specific galactic molecular cloud , s140 .",
    "their models assume a clumpy ism which permits uv radiation to penetrate deep into the cloud .",
    "they obtain column density ratios approaching ours for models with low volume filling factors ( 10% to 30% ) and with relatively large clumps ( 0.4 to 0.6 pc ) .",
    "of course , s140 is different from ngc604 - 2 ; it is illuminated by a single b0v star , not a giant hii region like ngc604 , so the agreement between the model and our observations should be taken with a grain of salt . however , lacking a detailed model specifically for ngc604 - 2 , a clumpy ism would explain our observations .      stark et al . ( 1997 ) have measured the [ ci ] emission towards two regions within the large magellanic cloud , n 159-w and 30 dor n. in the latter region , they obtain a i@xmath2}$]/i@xmath3 line ratio of 0.26 , twice the average for the milky way , but similar to what we have seen in ngc604 .",
    "they attribute this large ratio to the lower metallicity of the lmc .",
    "bolatto et al .",
    "( 2000 , in press ) find a similarly high line ratio , 0.23 @xmath19 0.03 , in the low metallicity local group dwarf irregular galaxy ic  10 .",
    "our observations are fairly consistent with this picture ; the metallicity of the ngc604 region is nearly half solar ( vilchez et al . 1988 ) while the lmc is about one - third solar ( 8.37 ; garnett 1990 ) , and ic  10 is one - fourth solar metallicity ( lequeux et al . 1979 ) .",
    "figure  5 shows a plot of i@xmath2}$]/i@xmath3 versus metallicity for molecular clouds in local group galaxies .",
    "the milky way galaxy is also included , with the data on i@xmath2}$]/i@xmath3 coming from the cobe data of wright et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . because cobe did not detect co j=1@xmath360 , we scaled the i@xmath2}$]/i@xmath41 ratio by a typical @xmath26co j=2@xmath361 / @xmath26co j=1@xmath360 line ratio of 0.7 ( sakamoto et al . 1994 ) .",
    "although only eight points are plotted , the molecular clouds found near hii regions have consistently higher line ratios than those with no nearby hii regions .",
    "this is to be expected if radiation from hii regions is primarily responsible for producing atomic carbon by photodissociation of co. there also appears to be a trend among the clouds near hii regions for i@xmath2}$]/i@xmath3 to decrease with increasing metallicity .",
    "this trend might be expected if the column density of co increases with metallicity , thereby more effectively shielding the interiors of the molecular clouds from dissociating radiation .",
    "it could also be a result of the metallicity dependence of the co to h@xmath6 conversion factor  if i(ci)/n(h@xmath6 ) remains constant , but i(co)/n(h@xmath6 ) decreases with metallicity , a similar effect might be observed .",
    "more data are needed to confirm these trends .",
    "figure  2 shows that the spatial distribution of [ ci ] emission is offset to the northwest relative to the co. this offset is not due to the pointing problems which were discussed and corrected in section  2 .",
    "the center of the giant hii region is northwest of ngc604 - 2 .",
    "this is where most of the o stars are found ( drissen et al .",
    "1993 ) and hence the source of uv photons .",
    "thus the offset of the [ ci ] emission is towards the direction from which the photodissociating photons are incident , suggesting an edge - on morphology for the pdr in ngc604 - 2 .",
    "the fact that [ ci ] emission is present into the center of the cloud indicates a non - negligible ionization fraction in the cloud s interior . at low ionizations",
    "the gas phase chemistry is dominated by reactions with h@xmath42 , which lead to the conversion of carbon into co ( graedel et al .",
    "one possibility to explain the necessary ionization inside the cloud is penetration by cosmic rays ( e.g. flower et al .",
    "we argue that this mechanism is not likely to be an important one in the case of ngc604 - 2 based upon the asymmetric spatial distribution of the [ ci ] emission . for energies of 10@xmath43 ev or less ,",
    "a galactic magnetic field prevents cosmic rays from escaping a galaxy freely ( longair 1994 ) .",
    "these cosmic rays spiral around the magnetic field lines , lose their original direction of motion , and become isotropic .",
    "thus ionization from cosmic rays would not be expected to produce the asymmetry in [ ci ] emission that we see .",
    "in addition , yang et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have identified supernovae driven shells in ngc604 , and the spatial distribution of these shells ( and hence the supernovae which could provide the cosmic rays ) is not consistent with the [ ci ] distribution .",
    "we can not rule out a contribution to the creation of c by cosmic rays , but the lack of [ ci ] emission at the ( 0,-5 ) position , where co emission is only 25% less than the cloud center ( see figure  1 ) , suggests that any such contribution is small .",
    "the ( 0,5 ) position lies on the opposite side of the cloud , but facing the center of the giant hii region , and i@xmath2}$ ] here is the strongest we have measured , stronger than at the center of the cloud , although the co emission is nearly the same as at ( 0,-5 ) .",
    "this result suggests that the atomic carbon is being created by the photodissociation of co by photons from the massive stars .",
    "the penetration of the photons would then be permitted by a clumpy ism with a moderate or low filling factor ( e.g. stutzki et al . 1988 ) .",
    "these photons penetrate partly through the cloud , even to the center , but do not penetrate all the way through , which explains the lack of [ ci ] emission on the far side .",
    "churchwell & goss ( 1999 ) argue that the molecular cloud lies behind the hii region , based upon a measurement of extinction towards the cloud that is too low for the molecular mass of the cloud .",
    "our observations do not conflict with this idea , as long as ngc604 - 2 is behind the bulk of the ionized gas along the line of sight , but still close enough to the hii region to receive the influx of uv photons that are responsible for dissociating co and thus producing atomic carbon .",
    "also , if the cloud were too far behind the hii region , then a position like ( 0.-5 ) would not be shadowed by the cloud center , and thus would show [ ci ] emission .",
    "we have mapped [ ci ] emission in a gmc in the giant hii region ngc604 , the largest hii region in m33 . the spatial distribution of the [ ci ] emission is offset with respect to the co j = 1@xmath360 emission , with the peak of the [ ci ] emission sitting in the direction of the center of the hii region .",
    "we have argued that this reflects the fact that the massive stars in the hii region produce an intense uv radiation field which photodissociates co into c and o and provides the ionization necessary for the chemical reactions which prevent co from reforming .",
    "the fact that the [ ci ] emission is seen all the way into the center of the molecular cloud can be understood in terms of a clumpy ism with a moderate or low filling factor which permits deep penetration of uv photons into the cloud .",
    "the average line ratio of i@xmath2}$]/i@xmath3 is 0.18 @xmath19 0.04 , and individual values range from 0.11 to 0.23 .",
    "values of 0.1 are commonly seen in galactic giant molecular clouds , while values of 0.2 are typical for environments of intense star formation activity .",

    "<S> we have mapped a giant molecular cloud in the giant hii region ngc604 in m33 in the 492 ghz @xmath0 transition of neutral atomic carbon using the james clerk maxwell telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we find the distribution of the [ ci ] emission to be asymmetric with respect to the co j=@xmath1 emission , with the peak of the [ ci ] emission offset towards the direction of the center of the hii region . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the line ratio i@xmath2}$]/i@xmath3 is highest ( @xmath4 0.2 ) facing the hii region and lowest ( @xmath5 0.1 ) away from it . </S>",
    "<S> these asymmetries indicate an edge - on morphology where the [ ci ] emission is strongest on the side of the cloud facing the center of the hii region , and not detected at all on the opposite side this suggests that the sources of the incident flux creating c from the dissociation of co are the massive stars of the hii region . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest line ratios are similar to what is observed in galactic molecular clouds , while the highest are similar to starburst galaxies and other regions of intense star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the column density ratio , n(c)/n(h@xmath6 ) is a few @xmath7  10@xmath8 , in general agreement with models of photodissociation regions . </S>"
