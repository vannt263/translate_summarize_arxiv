    "[ mz-2 ]    non - commutativity of tunneling hamiltonians has often been claimed in the literature to be unphysical .",

    ", we consider for a moment the boundary conditions which correspond to a closed geometry . in this case",
    "the quasi - particle operators @xmath377 are @xmath107-fold multi - valued operators .",
    "this is because the field @xmath378 is in fact an integral of the density @xmath379 over a closed contour that can have different numbers of winding , @xmath380 .",

    "this limitation on the eigenvalues of the operators @xmath385 , which any physically allowed state should satisfy , leads to the fact that @xmath389 we use the winding number @xmath390 as an additional index that denotes the quasi - particle branch , @xmath391 . here",
    "@xmath392 stands for the case where @xmath393 , i.e. , for the branch that starts from one of the ohmic contacts . in the language of wilson lines ,",
    "every branch is given by a line with the corresponding number of windings .",
    "if several branches are present , then one should take into account all possible processes in the tunneling hamiltonian including those that change the quasi - particle branch number .",
    "therefore , in general , the tunneling hamiltonian can be written as @xmath394 the commutation relations for quasi - particle operators ( [ commut-0 ] ) are easily generalized : @xmath395 and we arrive at the important conclusion that , in general , hamiltonians ( [ ham - gen ] ) , taken at different spatial points , do not commute .    in order to put our discussion into the context of previous work , we rewrite hamiltonian ( [ ham - gen ] ) in a slightly different form : @xmath396 where the operator @xmath397 introduced earlier obviously plays the role of a klein factor .",
    "interestingly , in the specific case when only the amplitudes @xmath398 and @xmath399 are non - zero , tunneling hamiltonians ( [ compare ] ) do commute at different spatial points .",
    "moreover , in the language of wilson lines the multiplication of the tunneling hamiltonian with the klein factor @xmath397 is equivalent to adding a loop to the corresponding wilson line , so that it goes all the way around the interferometer .",
    "it is easy to see that adding such a loop to the blue line in fig .",
    "[ mz-1 ] makes it topologically equivalent to the red line .",
    "therefore the hamiltonians , after such manipulation , indeed commute .",

    "in other words , they act on some additional hilbert space .",
    "this situation , however , is not satisfactory , because it contradicts the very well known aspect of the qhe that there exists a gap for excitations in the bulk , and the only degrees of freedom available are the edge excitations @xmath400 , including zero modes @xmath382 and @xmath383 .",
    "therefore , we think that klein factors should be expressed in terms of the same modes as the operators @xmath401 ( see , e.g. , ref .

    "[ mz - sect ] for calculations .",
    "our next remark concerns the statement made in the literature @xcite that it is impossible to observe a coherent part of the quasi - particle current .",
    "it has been claimed that several degeneracies are present in a system which lead to strong dephasing via two mechanisms . within our approach",
    "the first mechanism @xcite can be interpreted as being based on the fact that there exists a set of quasi - degenerate states which correspond to a shift of both edges.@xcite one may parametrize them as following : @xmath402 where @xmath403 .",
    "we denote these states with @xmath404 , and write @xmath405 .",
    "the density matrix for the interferometer , with the qh edges in an equilibrium state , can be written as @xmath406 the coherent part of the current generated by tunneling hamiltonian ( [ ham - gen ] ) and averaged with the density matrix ( [ rho0 ] ) reads @xmath407 in our paper we use tunneling hamiltonian ( [ ham-0 ] ) with @xmath408 .",
    "therefore the summation over the quantum number @xmath232 is trivial , @xmath409 , and does not lead to any physical effect .",
    "in contrast , using additional klein factors@xcite implies that @xmath410 .",

    "_ @xcite further assumed equal population @xmath412 , so that , after summation over @xmath232 , the coherent part of the quasi - particle current vanishes .    in the argument",
    "sketched above , in addition to the specific choice @xmath410 that has been addressed earlier , the assumption of the degeneracy of states @xmath404 , or equivalently , the high temperature limit @xmath413 , is of crucial importance .",
    "we note , however , that the shift ( [ shift ] ) leads to charging of the edges , and the corresponding energy is not small .",
    "the experiments [ - ] have been done in the regime where the temperature and the bias are smaller than this charging energy , and we do not see any difficulties , in principle , to achieve such a regime in the fractional qhe case .",
    "a second possible mechanism of dephasing is described in ref .",
    "an additional berry phase shift between two tunneling paths may appear if some number @xmath232 of localized quasi - particles are present in the bulk . in this case",
    "the coherent contribution to the tunneling current acquires the phase factor @xmath414 , which is similar to the one encountered in the first mechanism of dephasing discussed above . if the number , @xmath232 , of quasi - particles fluctuates , then the coherent part of the quasi - particle current may vanish , @xmath415 as a result of averaging over these fluctuations",
    ". we would like to stress that this mechanism may be avoided either by reducing the temperature , so that the activation of spontaneous phase slips is slow , or by using a high - quality sample . for instance , in the integer qhe case such telegraph processes have indeed been observed in the experiment [ ] and then reduced by tuning the system s parameters .",
    "to conclude , we recall that the mz interferometer , being a system that is strongly coupled to ohmic contacts , requires open boundary conditions .",
    "this leads to the non - commutativity of tunneling hamiltonians taken at different spatial points .",
    "we think that the non - commutativity of spatially separated operators naturally follows from the topological character of the effective theory , according to which the quasi - particles are not completely local objects , because they have `` tails '' in form of wilson lines .",
    "moreover , the non - locality in the effective theory does not contradict the local character of the underlying microscopic theory which does not necessary manifest itself in the low - energy limit .",
    "the klein factors , which have been introduced in earlier papers to ensure the commutativity of tunneling hamiltonians , require in fact closed boundary conditions and are therefore not applicable to mz interferometers .",
    "moreover , we have shown that even when klein factors may be used , they can not guarantee the commutativity of tunneling hamiltonians in general , while the specific choice proposed in refs .  [ ] and [ ] needs further justification .",
    "finally , we remark that the strong suppression of the phase coherence suggested in refs.and [ ] is not a fundamental property of the fractional qhe , and may be avoided in future experiments at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "the purpose of this discussion is to clarify the origin of the quasi - particle periodicity in physical observables .",
    "let us first analyze the dependence of the energies of the zero modes eigenstates @xmath404 ( see appendix [ klein ] ) of a qh fluid at @xmath138 on the singular magnetic flux @xmath263 threading the corbino disk . this problem has been considered by thouless and gefen in ref .",
    "following their argument , we note that the main contribution to the energy comes from coulomb interactions .",
    "therefore , under variation of the flux @xmath263 , the energies of zero modes eigenstates of a qh fluid , isolated inside a corbino disk , follow the branches with a fixed number of electrons . however , if the corbino disk is weakly coupled to metallic reservoirs , the number of electrons in the qh fluid is not conserved .",
    "therefore , if the ground state energy initially grows with the flux @xmath263 , it then switches to another branch by changing the number of electrons by 1 and starts to decrease with the flux .",
    "this behavior ( shown by the red line in fig .  [ magn ] ) repeats periodically with a period equal to @xmath416 .",
    "the electronic periodicity is restored if one takes into account the possibility of quasi - particle tunneling between the inner and outer edges of the corbino disk .",
    "such a perturbation mixes the states @xmath404 , with @xmath417 and opens a gap at the degeneracy points ( see fig .",
    "[ magn ] ) . as a result , under an adiabatic variation of the magnetic flux ,",
    "the qh fluid will follow the lowest energy state with the electronic period @xmath308 .",
    "[ magn ]    far away from equilibrium , when a potential difference is applied to metallic reservoirs and a charge current flows through an mz interferometer , the physical situation is generally more complicated",
    ". however , one can still rely on the effective theory by taking into account the described above dependence of the energy of zero modes on the magnetic flux and writing the hamiltonian as @xmath418    we stress that the the insertion of the singular flux does not affect the ab phase .",
    "this follows form the fact that there are two contributions to the integral @xmath419 over the mz contour @xmath420 .",
    "one contribution arises from the change in the field @xmath372 due to the variation of the external field @xmath421 , as follows from relation ( [ ba ] ) .",
    "the second contribution comes from the variation of the total charge inside the mz contour , repelled by the singular flux , according to relation ( [ j - bulk ] ) .",
    "these two effects cancel each other exactly , which can be viewed as a result of screening of the external field @xmath421 by the qh system .    to determine the current through the interferometer the averaging in the linear - response formula ( [ interf ] )",
    "must be done with respect to the equilibrium density matrix @xmath422 . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the fields @xmath423 can be shifted when performing the averaging so as to eliminate the dependence on the magnetic flux from hamiltonian ( [ ham - shift ] ) .",
    "this implies that the only physical consequence of the insertion of the singular magnetic flux in a finite size corbino disk is the coulomb blockade effect which has an electronic periodicity .",
    "however , this effect is absent in mz interferometers due to the strong coupling to ohmic contacts .",
    "the modulation of the ab phase via the insertion of a point - like flux is an idealization . in a typical experiment , the magnetic field",
    "can be changed only uniformly . in this case",
    "the phase acquired by a quasi - particle is no longer a topological number and may depend , e.g. , on the processes in ohmic contacts in a complicated way .",
    "therefore , it appears to be more appropriate to investigate the periodicity of ab oscillations by changing the modulation gate voltage instead of changing the magnetic field .    a gate voltage applied at the edge of a qh liquid leads to the displacement @xmath424 of the edge at the point @xmath235 .",
    "this displacement may be described as an accumulation of background 1d charge densities , @xmath425 , in the edge channels . in the presence of these densities , the fields @xmath144 are redefined as @xmath426 . as a consequence ,",
    "the correlation function @xmath427 of an excitation @xmath428 acquires a phase shift @xmath429 .",
    "this phase shift is proportional to the charge of the quasi - particle , @xmath430 , and to the area of the deformation @xmath431 .",
    "therefore the phase shift may be interpreted as an ab phase : @xmath432 where @xmath433 is the variation of the magnetic flux through the closed path of the mz interferometer , resulting from the deformation . for simplicity of notations , this additional phase ( [ add - phas ] ) is included in the tunneling amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ phas - ham ] ) .    to conclude , in our model , the periodicity of ab oscillations in the average current is determined by the charges of quasi - particles that tunnel . to verify this prediction",
    ", one should compare the periodicity in the weak tunneling regime , where only electron tunneling is possible , with the one in the weak backscattering regime , where the tunneling of quasi - particles is most relevant .",
    "in this appendix we illustrate the holographic principle by constructing the bulk effective models and showing that they determine the minimal edge models discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : multi - field - edge ] .",

    "for the two - field case , @xmath526 , the construction of allowed lattices is more complex . from the definition of relative angular momenta",
    "it follows that we may choose electronic bases with a gram matrix of the following form : @xmath527 we consider lattices with @xmath528 , which are physically most relevant .",
    "@xcite then one may simply list all models by going through all possible values of @xmath515 , @xmath514 and @xmath196 .",
    "@xcite furthermore , we limit our attention to the case @xmath529 , which is most important in the context of our paper .",
    "for convenience , we choose coordinates such that @xmath530 .",
    "the condition of unit charge , @xmath531 , for @xmath532 , partially fixes the form of electron vectors , @xmath165 , in these coordinates .",
    "namely , @xmath533 and @xmath534 , where the number @xmath535 is yet to be determined .",
    "it follows from the requirement @xmath536 that @xmath537 .",
    "the mutual statistical phase of two electrons , @xmath538 , should be an integer .",
    "this implies that @xmath539 is an integer number .",
    "thus we see that the special case @xmath529 corresponds to @xmath193 where @xmath107 is an integer .",
    "note that , for @xmath540 , the converse statement is also true , i.e. , for @xmath193 , _ all _ the two dimensional lattices have @xmath529 .",
    "after some elementary calculations , we find that , for @xmath193 , gram matrix ( [ gr-1 ] ) may be expressed as : @xmath541 from condition ( [ cond - main ] ) , applied to eq .",
    "( [ gr-2 ] ) , we find that the level @xmath542",
    ". therefore , all the lattices in the case @xmath193 can be parameterized by _ only two _ numbers , @xmath107 and @xmath232 .",
    "it is important to observe that , for all these lattices , @xmath543 .",
    "hence , for two - field models with @xmath193 , the minimal charge is always @xmath544 . introducing a pair of orthogonal vectors , @xmath545 , so",
    "that @xmath546 , the lattices may be written explicitly as @xmath547 and the couplings @xmath548 .",
