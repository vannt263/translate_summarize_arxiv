    "many kinds of mixtures of granules and water , such as clay , contract upon desiccation and form cracks . these fracture patterns are familiar to us as ordinary mud cracks . however , the fundamental questions about these phenomena have not yet been answered theoretically .",
    "the problems which need to be addressed include determining the condition under which fragmentation occurs , the dynamics displayed by cracks , and the patterns which grow .    in simple and traditional experiments on mud cracks ,",
    "a thin layer of a mixture in a rigid container with a horizontal bottom is prepared left to dry at room temperature @xcite .",
    "typically , clay , soil , flour , granules of magnesium carbonate and alumina are used . in almost all cases ,",
    "cracks extend from the surface to the bottom of the layer and propagate horizontally along a line , forming a quasi - two - dimensional structure .",
    "typically we observe a tiling pattern composed of rectangular cells in which cracks mainly join in a t - shape .",
    "groisman and kaplan carried out more detail experiments with coffee powder and reported 1 ) that the size of a crack cell after full drying is nearly proportional to the thickness of the layer and larger in the case of a `` slippery '' bottom , 2 ) that the velocity of a moving crack is almost independent of time for a given crack and very slow on the order of several millimeters per minute , but that it differs widely from one crack to another , and 3 ) that as the layer becomes thin , there is a transition to patterns which contain many y - shape joints and unclosed cells owing to the arrest of cracks@xcite .",
    "another experimental setup was used by allain and limat @xcite .",
    "this setup produces cracks that grow directionally by causing evaporation to proceed from one side of the container .",
    "sasa and komatsu have proposed a theoretical model for such systems @xcite .",
    "fragmentation of coating or painting also arises from desiccation , this has been studied theoretically by some people @xcite . from the viewpoint that fractures are caused by slow contraction , these problems can be thought of as belonging to the same category as thermal cracks in glasses @xcite and the formation of joints in rocks brought by cooling @xcite . in addition , we note that mixtures of granular matter and fluid have properties that vary greatly from that of complete elastic materials , in particular , dissipation and viscoelasticity .",
    "the propagation of cracks in such media has been investigated recently using developments in nonlinear physics @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we undertake a theoretical investigation of the experiments described above .",
    "we treat such system as consisting of fractures arising from quasi - static and uniform contraction in thin layers of linear elastic material .    in sec .",
    "[ 1d model-1 ] , we propose a one - dimensional model .",
    "our model takes into account the slip displacement on the bottom of a container , because most of the experiments can not be assumed to obey a fixed boundary condition .",
    "we can investigate the development of the size of a crack cell by applying a fragmentation condition to the balanced states of the elastic field .    in sec .",
    "[ 1d model-2 ] , we report the analytical results of our one - dimensional model . here",
    "we consider both the critical stress condition and the griffith criterion as the fragmentation condition .",
    "we consider these two alternative criteria because the nature of the breaking condition in mixtures of granules and water is not clear .",
    "the critical stress condition predicts that the final size of a crack cell is proportional to the thickness of the layer and that , in the case of a slippery bottom , it becomes much larger than the thickness .",
    "these predictions seem to be consistent with the experimental results .",
    "in contrast , we find that the griffith criterion predicts a different relation between the final size of a cell and the thickness .    in sec .",
    "[ 2d model-1 ] , we extend the model to two dimensions and investigate the time development of a crack . in order to describe the relaxation process of the elastic field , we use the kelvin model while taking into account the effect of the bottom of the container .",
    "we assume the stress , excluding dissipative force , to be constant in the front of a propagating crack tip and evaluate the velocity of a simple straight crack tip analytically .",
    "our results indicate that cracks advance at very slow speed in comparison with the sound velocity .    in sec .",
    "[ 2d model-2 ] , we report on the numerical simulations of our model that reproduce fracture patterns similar to those in real experiments .",
    "the growth of the patterns exhibits qualitative differences depending on the elastic constants and the relaxation time . as",
    "the relaxation time becomes smaller , in particular , we observe the growth of fingering patterns with tip splitting rather than side branching of cracks .    finally , we conclude the paper with a summary of the results and a discussion of the open problems in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we analyze the formation of cracks induced by desiccation in terms of the following four processes .    1 .",
    "the water in a mixture evaporates from the surface of a layer .",
    "2 .   each part of the mixture shrinks upon desiccation .",
    "stress increases in the material because contraction is hindered near the bottom of a container .",
    "fracture arises under some fragmentation condition .    in this section",
    ", we examine each process individually and construct a one - dimensional model , where we introduce simple assumptions regarding the unclear properties of granular materials .",
    "some similar models have been proposed previously @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional models assume that cracks are formed one at a time , each propagating along a line and thereby dividing the system into two pieces separated by a boundary with one - dimensional structure . using this assumption",
    ", we can ignore the propagation of cracks and consider the development of patterns by using only the condition of separation .    1 .   from a microscopic viewpoint , water either exists in the inside of the particles of granular materials or acts to create bonds between the particles .",
    "here , we can introduce the water content averaged over a much larger area than that of a single particle and measure the degree of drying . when the thickness of a layer @xmath0 is sufficiently thin and the characteristic time of desiccation @xmath1 is very large , the water content in the layer can be considered uniform .",
    "assuming that water transfers diffusively in a layer , the sufficient condition here is that @xmath2 is much smaller than the diffusion constant .",
    "therefore , we restrict our consideration to the case of the uniform water distribution and exclude the process of water transfer from the model .",
    "the main cause of contraction is the shrinking of particles in the mixture arising from desiccation .",
    "the water content is considered to determine the shrinking rate in the case of uniform contraction in which all the boundaries of the mixture are stress - free .",
    "we refer to this shrinking rate as `` free shrinking rate '' in the following discussions and this concept is used in place of the concept of the water this makes clear the relation between the present problems and those involving fractures induced by other causes , such as temperature gradient @xcite , with slow contraction .",
    "we note , however , that it is more difficult to measure the free shrinking rate than the water content experimentally and it is thus necessary to know their relation to compare our theory with experiments on the time development of patterns .",
    "+ the contraction force is thought to arise from the water bonds among particles .",
    "we estimate the reynolds number @xmath3 to consider the behavior of the water in a bond .",
    "the diameter of a particle @xmath4 is generally about @xmath5 , and the kinematic viscosity of water @xmath6 is about @xmath7 .",
    "although the propagation of a crack causes the displacement of surrounding particles with opening the crack surfaces , the velocity of the displacement is smaller than the crack speed itself , except in the microscopic region at the crack tip",
    ". therefore we estimate the typical velocity of water @xmath8 in the bulk of a mixture to be smaller than the crack speed .",
    "the crack speed has been measured as about 0.1 mm / s in experiments and it is , of course , considerably faster than the shrinking speed of the horizontal boundary with desiccation , which is typically about @xmath9 .",
    "thus the reynolds number @xmath10 is estimated to be smaller than 1/100 .",
    "we expect that the water among the particles behaves like a viscous fluid and that the mixture displays strong dissipation .",
    "+ if a material displays strong dissipation and shrinks quasi - statically , the elastic field is balanced to minimize the free energy , except during the time when cracks are propagating .",
    "we deal with balanced states for the present and return to the problem of relaxation in order to treat the development of cracks in sec .",
    "[ 2d model-1 ] .",
    "because mixtures of granules and fluids have many unclear properties with respect to elasticity , we idealize them as linear elastic materials .",
    "when the free volume - shrinking rate @xmath11 is uniform , it is well known that the free energy density of a uniform and isotropic linear elastic material is given in terms of the stress tensor @xmath12 in the form @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the elastic constants and repeated indices indicate summation .",
    "the stress tensor is expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 . as a result ,",
    "the balanced equation of the elastic field @xmath18 does not include the shrinking rate @xmath11 for linear elastic materials with uniform contraction and it is the same as in the case of the elastic materials without shrinking .",
    "the effect of contraction appears only through the boundary conditions .",
    "after the formation of cracks divides the system into cells , each cell is independent of the others , because the vertical surfaces of cracks become stress - free boundaries . without considering the boundary conditions on the lateral sides of the container",
    ", we can simplify the problem by starting with the initial condition that the system has stress - free boundaries on its lateral sides .",
    "in contrast to the lateral and the top surfaces , the bottom of a layer is not a stress - free boundary .",
    "the difference among the boundary conditions produces strain with contraction and then stress .",
    "this is the cause of fracture .",
    "+ we observe the slip of layers along the bottom in most experiments .",
    "thus we introduce slip displacement with a frictional force into the model . because the frictional force is caused by the water between the bottom of a layer and the container , it is considered to remain finite even in the limit of vanishing thickness of a layer @xmath0 @xcite . in order to understand the effects of friction for crack patterns , we simplify the maximum frictional force per unit area of the surface to be constant and independent of @xmath0 without making a distinction between static and kinetic frictional effects",
    "cracks propagate very slowly in a mixture of granules and water . because this propagation resembles quasi - static growth of cracks , the first candidate of the fragmentation condition is the griffith criterion applied to the free energy of the entire system .",
    "+ however , we note that ordinary brittle materials break instantaneously , not quasi - statically , in the situation that the stress increases without fixing the deformation of the system .",
    "the situation is similar to that in a shrinking mixture .",
    "we need to consider the possibility that cracks in a mixture propagate slowly owing to dissipation .",
    "therefore we consider two typical fragmentation conditions , the critical stress condition and the griffith criterion , in the first and the last halves of sec.[1d model-2 ] , respectively .",
    "+ in the context of the critical stress condition , the fragmentation condition is that the maximum principal stress exceeds a material constant at breaking .",
    "this has also been used in many numerical models because of the technical advantage of the local condition .",
    "our model introduces the critical value for the energy density as an equivalent condition .",
    "we note that the energy of the system before the fragmentation is higher than after the fragmentation because the critical value is a material constant independent of the system size .",
    "+ in contrast , using the griffith criterion as an alternative fragmentation condition stipulates that the energy changes neither before nor after breaking .",
    "this condition is used by sasa and komatsu in their theory @xcite .    with the above considerations , we construct a one - dimensional model , following the lead of sasa and komatsu @xcite . as we show in fig .",
    "[ 1dmodel.eps ] , we consider a chain of springs by a distance @xmath19 as the discrete model of the thin layer of an elastic material , where we number the nodes @xmath20 for a system of half - size @xmath21 . in order to represent the vertical direction of a sufficiently thin layer ,",
    "we introduce vertical springs with length @xmath0 which connect each node to an element on the bottom .",
    "the vector @xmath22 represents the horizontal and vertical displacements of the @xmath23th node , and @xmath24 is the horizontal displacement of the element on the bottom connected with the node .",

    "neglecting the short periods during which the system experiences cracking and slip , ( [ 1d energy ] ) and ( [ slip condition ] ) constitute the closed form of our one - dimensional model with the fragmentation condition given in the next section .",
    "we here report analytical results of our one - dimensional model for the typical two fragmentation conditions , i.e , the critical stress condition and the griffith condition .",
    "the critical stress condition demands that the maximum principal stress exceeds a material constant at the fragmentation .    in the case of this condition",
    ", we can generally demonstrate that it is difficult to treat the bottom surface as a fixed boundary for a uniform and isotropic elastic material .",
    "we first explain it before the analysis of the one - dimensional model .",
    "let us think of the layer of a linear elastic material contracting with a fixed boundary condition on the bottom .",
    "it is shrinking more near the top surface , and the cross section assumes the form of a trapezoid as we show schematically in fig . [ boundary.eps ] .",

    "the horizontal tensions at a and b are the same because of the fixed boundary condition on the bottom .",
    "although the stress at c is as horizontal as at a , the strength is weaker .",
    "b is also pulled in the direction along the lateral surface due to the deformation . using a , b , and c to represent the respective strengths of the maximum principle",
    "stresses at these three points , we find that they are related as @xmath53 , and we expect generally that fracture arises at b before either a or c. if the contraction proceeds while the fixed boundary condition on the bottom is maintained , the lateral side breaks near the bottom before the division of the cell , and the fixed boundary condition can not persist . hence we need to consider the displacement of the layer with respect to the bottom to deal with this problem correctly .    in our one - dimensional model ,",
    "we break a spring when its energy exceeds a critical value .",
