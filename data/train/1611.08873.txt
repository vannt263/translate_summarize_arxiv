    "<S> , mechanical resonators become increasingly sensitive to adsorbed mass  @xcite and external forces  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these systems hold promise for exploring a broad range of physical phenomena , such as magnetic resonance imaging  @xcite , surface science  @xcite , out - of - equilibrium thermodynamics  @xcite , and light - matter interaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the efficient motion detection of these small resonators remains a challenging task , despite intense efforts in improving detection methods over the last decade  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has prevented the study of some of the most fundamental properties of these systems , such as the time evolution of the brownian motion and other types of displacement fluctuations of nanotube resonators  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the displacement fluctuations of a resonator with a high quality - factor are fully characterized by recording the time - evolution of the two quadratures of motion . </S>",
    "<S> the displacement @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 the two quadratures , @xmath5 the mechanical resonance frequency , and @xmath6 the time . </S>",
    "<S> the quadratures are obtain via real - time demodulation of the motion signal , which must resolve the vibrations at a rate much faster than the mechanical resonance frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this condition has never been achieved with resonators based on nanotubes , graphene , and semiconductor monolayers , due to insufficient sensitivity of the tranduction schemes employed thus far . </S>",
    "<S> these include methods based on electrical detection  @xcite , optical interferometry  @xcite , and scanning probe microscopy  @xcite . the relatively poor efficiency of these techniques is essentially explained by the weak interaction overlap between the measurement probe ( e.g. electric or optical fields ) and the nanometer scale mechanical resonator . with the advantage of much reduced interaction volumes , electron microscopy has also been considered for the study of the fluctuating behaviors in nanomechanical resonators  @xcite ; where long - term imaging is used for quantitatively characterizing the variance of thermally induced mechanical motion . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , electron microscopy has been utilized for ultra - sensitive detection and manipulation of resonant properties of nanomechanical resonators with picogram effective masses  @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we push this novel e - beam nanoelectromechanical approach for detecting the thermally - induced fluctuations of attogram - scale ( @xmath7 ) carbon nanotube resonators in real - time for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> we focus the electron beam of a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) at a fixed position , and measure the intensity of the electrons scattered inelastically from the nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> this allows high signal - to - noise detection of thermally driven resonances at frequencies up to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this also enables the full access to the real - time trajectories of the quadratures . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that nanotube resonators undergo thermally - driven brownian motion . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the motion is driven by thermal noise , with negligible electron beam backaction noise . </S>",
    "<S> this new method also allows us to simultaneously measure the time - evolution of two modes polarised perpendicularly . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the electron beam and the nanotube may be increased by depositing amorphous carbon onto the nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> this results in increased energy absorption which may yield to dynamical backaction effects and notably to self - oscillating behaviours that are observed in the present work . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the electron beam of a sem is a unique tool for addressing the nature of the mechanical motion .    </S>",
    "<S> * motion detection with a focused electron beam . * our detection scheme relies on coupling nanomechanical motion to a focused beam of electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> electron beams can be focused to spot sizes approaching the diameter of nanotube resonators , ensuring a much higher interaction overlap compared to usual capacitive or optical techniques used to detect nanomechanical motion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the principle of the detection works as follows @xcite : the collisions between the electron beam and the nanotube yield to the emission of so - called secondary electrons ( ses ) , which result from inelastic scattering mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the displacements of the nanotube within the electron beam create a strong modulation of the secondary electrons current , whose fluctuations are detected by means of a high bandwidth scintillator . </S>",
    "<S> note that previous measurements of nanotubes using electron beams did not resolve neither the power spectrum nor the real - time evolution of their mechanical fluctuations @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the samples are mounted onto a 3-dimensional positioning stage hosted in a commercial sem delivering a highly focused , ultra - low noise electron beam @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the sem chamber is thoroughly pumped in order to secure a high vacuum level , preventing any significant electron - beam assisted spurious deposition mechanism on the nanotube  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical resonators discussed below consist of single - clamped nanotubes that are anchored at the edge of silicon wafers ( fig . 1 ( b , c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we specifically consider three distinct devices , labelled d@xmath9 to d@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this detection method can also be employed with doubly - clamped nanotubes , but the results are not shown here .    </S>",
    "<S> we first operate the sem in the conventional `` scanning mode '' , with the electron beam being scanned over the surface of the sample and the ses response simultaneously acquired . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2(a ) shows a typical ses image obtained by scanning a suspended carbon nanoresonator representative of those investigated in this work ( d1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the image seems increasingly blurred towards the upper end of the nanoresonator , which is interpreted as a consequence of position noise @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the latter is large compared to the spatial extension of the electron beam , the integrated current @xmath11 becomes simply proportional to the probability @xmath12 to find the object at the electron beam position @xmath13 within the integration time @xmath14 ( here @xmath15 denotes the ses emission rate ) . </S>",
    "<S> provided that the image integration time is long with respect to the motion coherence time , the signal becomes proportional to the asymptotic probability , that is the spatial probability density function ( pdf ) associated with the position noise @xcite , @xmath16 . for </S>",
    "<S> a singly clamped , unidimensional euler - bernoulli beam vibrating in the scanning plane and at thermal equilibrium , this probability is given by :    @xmath17    with @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively denoting the axis and vibrational direction of the carbon nanotube resonator , @xmath20 its fundamental mode shape @xcite and @xmath21 the thermal motion variance ( the origin of the referential being taken at the anchor point of the resonator ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2(b ) shows two cross - sections of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) ( black , dashed arrow ) obtained with two distinct scanning rates , corresponding to short and long electron beam exposure , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - sections confirm the gaussian scaling of the ses emission rate , and enables to extract the same value of the thermal motion variance @xmath22 , independent from the exposure duration , showing that the nanomechanical dynamics is negligibly affected by the electron beam as further discussed below . </S>",
    "<S> measurements on other nanotube cantilevers show that @xmath23 remains constant upon rotating the nanotube along its axis . </S>",
    "<S> this is because nanotube cantilevers feature two fundamental modes polarized perpendicularly with similar effective masses and similar resonant frequencies , so that the variance of the projected thermal motion is independent of the rotation angle .    to further establish the vibrational origin of this motion imprecision </S>",
    "<S> , we turn the sem into `` spot mode '' , where the electron beam is fixed at a given position . </S>",
    "<S> we set the electron beam at the tip of the resonator and acquire the ses current fluctuations using a spectrum analyser ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2(c ) shows two peaks centred at @xmath24 and @xmath25 , consistent with the expected resonant behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> the signal to noise ratio of the low - frequency resonance is 14  db , limited by broadband background scattering ( linear spectral decay , arising from the detector cutoff frequency of the sem ) . </S>",
    "<S> we verified that these peaks vanish when decoupling the electron beam from the nanoresonator , confirming their motional origin .    the measurements in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b , c ) enable to determine the basic mechanical properties of the carbon nanotube resonator . </S>",
    "<S> the motion variance can be written as a function of the lateral spring constant @xmath26 , @xmath27 , yielding @xmath28 , with the temperature @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the effective mass @xmath30 expresses in terms of the spring constant and mechanical resonance frequency , @xmath31 . from the values of the lateral spring constant and nanotube length , </S>",
    "<S> the radius can be evaluated on the order of @xmath32 , assuming that the nanotube contains one wall ( supplementary information ) . using the length and radius of the nanotube and the mass density of pristine graphene </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain that @xmath33 . the difference between this value and the mass measured above </S>",
    "<S> is attributed to a thin layer of contamination adsorbed on the nanotube .    as mentioned earlier , the above measurements are weakly sensitive to e - beam induced dynamical effects , which would result in strong distortions of the motion pdf : because of the much reduced surface of the electron beam compared to the motion variance , the average electrical power received by the nanotube resonator strongly depends on the e - beam position ( see supplementary information ) . to verify the impact of the electron beam on the nanomechanical dynamics , we subsequently image the nanotube resonator by setting the e - beam dwell time @xmath34 to short and extended values ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) left and right , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> short dwell times enable to decrease the effective electrical power received by the nanotube , at the expense of decreased signal - to - noise ratio , whereas extended dwell times correspond to higher e - beam effective exposure . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained motion pdf remains gaussian and with very similar variances in both cases , excluding any significant dynamical contribution arising from the electron beam fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the electron beam may be responsible for asymmetric electrothermal dynamical backaction effects , which either cool or amplify the nanomechanical vibrations depending on the side from which the nanotube is exposed @xcite . however , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) shows that the motion pdf remains symmetric at lower dwell time , which indicates that dynamical backaction effects remain negligible .    </S>",
    "<S> * damping rate of nanotube resonators . * </S>",
    "<S> the potential of nanomechanical devices relies on their ultra - sensitive dynamical behaviour , which requires the ability to operate them close to their fundamental limits and in real - time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to do so , we connect the scintillator output of the sem to an ultra - fast lock - in amplifier , which we use for demodulating the quadratures of the electromechanical signal around the mechanical resonance frequency . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3(a ) shows the fluctuations spectrum of the out - of - phase quadrature obtained with device d2 , with the demodulation frequency being set to @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> two peaks are observed , with comparable widths and heights.using the measured resonant frequency and the spatial pdf measurement , we obtain @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> figures 3(b ) and 3(c ) further show the spectrum of the electromechanical signal as demodulated around each resonance frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the data adjust very well to lorentzian models ( plain lines ) , suggesting that the nanotube resonator behaves as a linearly damped , 2-dimensional harmonic oscillator .    to address the origin of the observed mechanical linewidths , we compute the autocovariance of the energy of the electromechanical signal @xmath40 , with @xmath41 the measurement delay time , and @xmath42 statistical average . </S>",
    "<S> the energy autocovariance has indeed the property to be insensitive towards frequency noise ( see supplementary information ) , enabling the pure extraction of the mechanical damping rates , with the additional benefit of minimal driving amplitude , therefore avoiding possible nonlinear artefacts @xcite . for a linear , </S>",
    "<S> stationary driven non - degenerate 2-dimensional mechanical oscillator , this energy autocovariance is independent of @xmath6 and can be shown to read as ( see supplementary information ) : @xmath43 with @xmath44 the frequency splitting between the two modes and with @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 the mechanical damping rate , the motion variance and the electromechanical coupling rate associated with each vibrational direction ( @xmath48 ) , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> [ eq:2 ] ( plain line ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to compare the `` apparent '' quality factors @xmath49 obtained from the fits of the quadrature spectrum ( @xmath50 denoting the mechanical linewidth associated with each vibrational direction , @xmath48 ) , to the `` intrinsic '' quality factors @xmath51 , measured via the autocovariance of the energy . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements presented on figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) and 3(d ) are consecutively repeated a number of times and used for extracting the corresponding damping parameters , yielding to @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> these values show no significant difference between the apparent and intrinsic quality factors , which establishes that the measured decoherence is dominated by dissipation mechanisms in the carbon nanotube resonator . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the duffing restoring force and the mode - mode coupling forces , which arise from inertial nonlinear effects in singly - clamped beams @xcite , are weak enough so that motional fluctuations do not induce sizable dephasing  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the very low level of correlations indicates that potential landscape nonlinearities have negligible effects , to first order @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that the 2-dimensional , non - degenerate nature of suspended nano - cantilevers provides them with the peculiar property to develop short - term spatial correlations under random external driving , such as the one resulting from measurement backaction . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations manifest through strong distortions in the electromechanical spectrum @xcite , which are not observed in our measurements ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> the above presented results have been obtained under optimized experimental conditions , with e - beam induced dynamical effects being kept negligible ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it is essential to maintain excellent vacuum conditions in order to avoid unwanted contamination processes , which are enhanced under e - beam exposure ( @xcite , see also supp . </S>",
    "<S> inf . ] . the deposited material ( e.g. amorphous carbon ) </S>",
    "<S> may indeed act as an efficient energy absorber , yielding non - instantaneous heating of the cnt resonator . </S>",
    "<S> an important aspect of our work relies in the fact that we are able to straightforwardly address the dynamical consequences of such effects .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been previously shown that electro / opto - mechanical coupling can change the effective temperature of the resonator in a cavity - free scheme @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the carbon nanotube motion evolves in a delayed force gradient @xcite leading to electromechanically - induced dynamical effects which may alter the mechanical behavior . </S>",
    "<S> figure 5(a ) shows two mechanical spectra acquired with the e - beam being positioned at two distinct locations of an amorphous carbon `` contamination island '' grown at the edge of the resonator ( device d3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> efficient cooling ( broad curve ) and heating ( narrow curve ) of a carbon nanotube resonator are consequently observed .    </S>",
    "<S> a mechanical resonator undergoing ponderomotive heating is susceptible to enter the instable regime of self - oscillation  @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the mere mechanical spectrum may not allow distinguishing between a stable and an instable regime , due notably to the unavoidable presence of frequency noise . here , we show that by extracting in real - time the motion quadratures , we are able to unveil signatures in the phase - space trajectory indicating a self - oscillation .    figure 5(b ) shows a hole in the pdf suggesting oscillations of the associated motion quadratures . in an instable regime </S>",
    "<S> the nanotube is undergoing self - sustained oscillations rather than the ordinary thermal random walk . </S>",
    "<S> the phase - space trajectory is then confined in a well - defined region with a non - zero mean amplitude value . </S>",
    "<S> the demodulation frequency detuning and the residual frequency noise lead to the exploration of all four phase - space quadrants . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , figure 5(c-(i , ii ) ) depict the histograms of the motion quadratures , both presenting a non - gaussian distribution as it would be expected for a non - thermal state .    * discussion . * </S>",
    "<S> the present work demonstrates that our novel measurement method enables to detect the vibrations of nanotube - based resonators with masses as low as @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of such ultra - low mass resonators raises the question of the limits of our approach . besides the strong , sub - nanometre confinement of the electron probe , </S>",
    "<S> the other key element of our scheme lies in the layout of the device . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of any electron scatterer within the immediate vicinity of the free - standing nano - object enables a very high ses contrast , which is at the origin of the high motion sensitivity ( see supplementary information ) .    on a more fundamental side </S>",
    "<S> the measurement is responsible for a random backaction that may affect the vibrational fluctuations of the measured objects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while such effects are not observed in the present work ( where the investigated devices are driven by thermal forces ranging between @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) , they may become significant for nanotube resonators with higher quality factors . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , e - beam quantum backaction acting on thick semiconducting scatterers has recently been evaluated to be on the order of @xmath70 under standard operating conditions @xcite , which should be in reach e.g. at low temperature , where the mechanical quality factors are found to be enhanced by several orders of magnitude @xcite . though certainly representing a limit from the sensing point of view , this points out that singly clamped nanotube resonators are devices of choice for probing and controlling quantum properties of electronic beams .    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we would like to once more attract the attention on a very important and useful characteristic of our singly clamped suspended nanotube resonators , that is their 2-dimensional vibrational nature . </S>",
    "<S> this property makes these resonators sensitive to spatially induced motion correlations , resulting in strong distortions in their electromechanical spectrum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these signatures ( such as the non - lorentzian resonance lineshapes in response to an external piezo drive , see supplementary information ) enable to address the presence and nature of external driving forces , with no further calibration being required . in particular , it is interesting to note that these nanomechanical objects are expected to surpass the limits set by quantum backaction in principle @xcite , which has so far never been observed and would represent an important step from the perspective of quantum measurement . </S>",
    "<S> this 2-dimensional behaviour has also been highlighted as a strong asset in the context of ultra - sensitive nanomechanical detection , related to the corresponding ability to self - discriminate the external noise mode in phase - coherent measurements @xcite , which will be highly beneficial to our systems .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusion * we have shown that the focused electron - beam of a sem operated in spot mode allows to detect the noise dynamics of attogram - scale singly clamped suspended carbon nanotubes resonators in real - time . we have demonstrated that a sem operated in spot mode behaves as a stereoscope with our devices , enabling the tri - dimensional reconstruction of their motion fluctuations in real - time . </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a detailed analysis of the 2-dimensional noise trajectories both in space and time , and shown that such small objects behave as brownian particles evolving in a two - dimensional harmonic potential . </S>",
    "<S> our work paves the way towards the exploration of novel thermodynamic regimes at scales which have been so far inaccessible experimentally . </S>"
