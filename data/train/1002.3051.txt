    "resonances in quantum mechanics describe states evolving non - unitarily @xcite , both decaying and building ones , and have found applications in the study of nuclear reactions . as such , they have been more often studied in the case of spherical nuclear potentials , mainly of the `` shell - model '' type and restricting the analysis to the radial s - wave equation . albeit for obvious unessential differences in the boundary conditions ,",
    "the physical picture is similar to the case of the 1-dimensional barriers we are considering , more akin to condensed matter systems or ion - trapping devices .",
    "the interest is alive and work is still in progress on the physical interpretation of resonances @xcite .",
    "resonant solutions to the @xmath1 equation occur in any simple potential barrier with a compact support , the plain square barrier being the most simple , tractable and fully representative example , and they are more often found in alternative specialized expansions of the green function and other physically relevant objects .",
    "they correspond to complex energies and momenta , which place them out of the familiar realm of hermitian operators in hilbert spaces , where a wealth of well known mathematical properties is available .",
    "though having been first studied in early times @xcite@xcite , the non - trivial mathematical properties of resonances have spurred a long lasting investigation effort .",
    "this paper focuses on some still debatable issues regarding the norm , inner products and completeness properties of resonant states .",
    "the issue of the completeness arises in its simplest form as soon as one attempts , for instance , to expand the identity in terms of projectors on bound ( if any ) @xmath2 , resonance @xmath3 and background ( `` scattering '' complex energy ) @xmath4 states , namely @xmath5 where the second sum may involve a variable number and type of resonances .",
    "such an expansion is , in principle , attainable by deforming , in the complex ( two - sheet ) plane @xcite , the continuum real energy integration occurring in the traditional expansion in terms of bound and scattering states @xmath6 following the lines of the proof of ( 2 ) , as given for instance by @xcite . in particular cases a complete expansion in terms of resonances ( plus bound states ) can be found , as for example for continuum wave functions ( or the scattering solutions ) _ within _ a finite region including the support of the barrier @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "this has direct application for instance in time - dependent problems , as in the time evolution of quantum decay @xcite . in the general case ,",
    "covering the whole space , directly testing any resonance expansion like ( 1 ) against the idempotence requirement @xmath7 , needs the computation of the inner products of all these families of states with each other .",
    "we aim to perform some steps in this direction .",
    "the difficulty stems from the divergent asymptotic behaviour of the resonance solutions , which leads to infinite norms and seemingly divergent and hard to calculate inner products , and has given rise to a variety of proposals to circumvent it .",
    "these proposals adopt different prescriptions to render finite the space integrals involved in these products and in general matrix elements .",
    "we may quote analytical continuations of the resonant solutions in the complex momentum plane @xcite , the `` external complex scaling '' @xcite of the space - coordinate integration variable , and the introduction of convergence factors in the integrals .    in this paper we shall adopt a gaussian convergence factor , first introduced by zeldovich @xcite and used by others @xcite , with which a limit can be worked out yielding novel",
    "non - trivial results : in fact we recover the result of the integrals that were already well defined , and extend the finite result to a newer region of the complex momentum plane .",
    "the procedure , which avoids relying on analytical continuation arguments , leads to a prescription for the definition of the inner products , yielding a specific set of orthogonality relations .",
    "our results are derived for a general potential with finite support of which the bound and resonant poles of the s - matrix are known .",
    "the usual inner product in the hilbert space , involving the complex conjugate of one of the wave functions , is defined so as to have real probability densities and norms for the general wave functions .",
    "however when dealing with resonant solutions , a symmetrical inner product is involved in the convolution of the green function with initial states ( superpositions of scattering states ) , and is associated to a complex `` norm '' @xcite , so we explore the properties of both alternative definitions .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in section 2 we briefly review the relevant features of the resonances while fixing some notation and stressing the relationships between proper , anti , outgoing and incoming resonant solutions . in section 3",
    "we calculate the standard inner product of resonant states between themselves and with the bound and the scattering states . in section 4",
    "we introduce the symmetrical inner product , and give the result for the resonant - resonant and resonant - scattering product .",
    "then in section 5 we outline in some detail the regularization prescription adopted , based on a gaussian factor , and show how the ( either finite or divergent ) results are recovered in the non - regularized limit . for comparison ,",
    "we comment here on some other prescriptions found in the literature .",
    "finally the conclusions are drawn in section 6 .",
    "the crucial integral formulas are derived in an appendix .",
    "we consider the 1-d time - independent @xmath1 equation @xmath8\\;\\psi(x , p ) = 0\\ ] ] where we use units such that @xmath9 .    for a cut - off potential @xmath10 describing a general barrier with support in the compact interval [ 0,_l _ ] , besides the usual scattering _ in _ and _ out _ solutions for continuous real energy @xmath11 and possible bound states ( discrete real @xmath12 , one has resonant solutions ( gamow states ) satisfying the homogeneous _ outgoing _ resonant boundary conditions ( orbcs ) , @xmath13 solutions @xmath14 , called proper ( _ outgoing _ ) resonances , exist for a denumerable set of isolated values @xmath15 of @xmath16 ( with corresponding energies @xmath17 ) lying inside the octants close to the real axis ( i.e. @xmath18 ) in the lower half complex plane ( i.e. @xmath19 ) , and occupy symmetrical positions with respect to the imaginary axis ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "it is customary to label them as @xmath15 ( @xmath20 ) when @xmath21 and as @xmath22 their symmetric ones , some times called anti - resonances . in the case of a simple square barrier , the real parts @xmath23 tend to be spaced regularly for increasing @xmath24 , while @xmath25 grows slowly @xcite .",
    "rbcs with reversed sign of @xmath26 in ( 4 ) correspond to _ incoming _ solutions @xmath27 , and the momenta @xmath28 lie in the upper half complex plane .",
    "we denote with @xmath29 these solutions and with @xmath30 the corresponding states .",
    "notice that the corresponding energies @xmath31 lie in the first riemann sheet . for real potentials",
    "@xmath10 , the complex conjugates @xmath32 of the outgoing resonances correspond instead to yet outgoing solutions with mirror momenta @xmath33 , and energies @xmath34 in the second riemann sheet , so that @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for the same reason , the complex conjugates of the incoming resonances are again incoming solutions .",
    "in the literature it has been easily mistaken @xmath32 for an incoming solution .",
    "the orbcs are equivalent to imposing the asymptotic form @xmath37 where the amplitudes @xmath38 and @xmath39 differ by a phase and are defined up to a global arbitrary factor .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the norm @xmath40 is even more divergent than for the dirac states @xmath41 , causing both kinds of states not to belong to @xmath42 .",
    "this fact , as opposite to the finite norm of the bound states , has been addressed in the framework of rigged hilbert spaces ( rhs ) @xcite@xcite along the same lines adopted for the dirac kets . in rhs , these states are interpreted just as linear functionals on more restricted spaces ( hilbert or schwartz ) in which an inner product is properly defined , but nevertheless it is customary to consider , in a somewhat relaxed sense , inner products of the dirac kets which have a meaning only as distributions , namely @xmath43 . however , when one tries to give an answer of this type for the resonance states , the inner products @xmath44 may be expected to be generally divergent as well , because of the exponential growth for large @xmath45 .",
    "for this reason their actual calculation has spurred the adoption of a number of elaborated strategies .",
    "the same difficulties affect the inner products @xmath46 between resonant and scattering states and , more generally , between resonant states and wave packets .",
    "this is an important issue as long as the analytical calculation of , for instance , the time evolution of an initial state impinging on a barrier @xcite , or of the shutter problem @xcite , contains sums of terms with poles in the resonant momenta . for the ( either laplace or fourier ) transform of the time dependent",
    "green function one has @xcite @xmath47 the interpretation of the pole terms as ( transient ) excitations of the resonant eigenmodes of the system requires the knowledge of the projection of the initial state on the resonant ones . the dimensionless normalization factor in ( 8) is @xcite@xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which is a sort of ( complex ) `` norm '' .",
    "notice that , when applied to wave functions @xmath51 , it reminds the usual ( real ) norm in hilbert space albeit for replacing the squares by the square modulus and letting @xmath52 and @xmath53 recede respectively to @xmath54 and to @xmath55 . for the resonant solutions",
    "however , @xmath56 diverges in this limit .",
    "in this section we shall calculate the usual inner products @xmath57 of resonant states with themselves ( 7 ) and their mixed products @xmath58 and latexmath:[$\\langle\\phi_i    method leads also to the usual inner products latexmath:[$\\langle\\phi_i    and @xmath43 .",
    "the space integral giving the inner product of two resonant solutions can be split in three sectors @xmath60    the orbcs in @xmath61 and @xmath62 , together with their complex conjugates , allow to express the finite integral @xmath63 in terms of the amplitudes @xmath64 and @xmath65 outside the barrier , regardless of the explicit form of @xmath14 inside the barrier and hence of the particular form of the potential .",
    "the procedure uses the @xmath66 operator @xmath67 and integration by parts to obtain @xmath68^l_0\\\\\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69\\equiv \\phi\\,\\partial_x\\psi-\\psi\\partial_x\\,\\phi$ ] is the wronskian of the functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 , so that @xmath72 then cancelations occur such that @xmath73    now the point is the calculation of the integral in ( 13 ) .",
    "we adopt the limit @xmath74 in ( 29 ) as a prescription for the result of ( 13 ) , and defer the discussion of our scheme to section 5 and to the appendix .    with this prescription",
    "we finally obtain @xmath75 in particular @xmath76 , as expected .    for each resonant state @xmath3",
    ", the result ( 14 ) defines a `` neighborhood of divergence '' so that @xmath3 is orthogonal to any other @xmath77 the momentum @xmath78 of which lies outside a `` cone of divergence '' with apex in @xmath79 , and gives a divergent inner product if @xmath78 lies inside this cone ( figure 1 )     for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , while @xmath82 for @xmath83 .,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      the _ in _ and _ out _ scattering solutions obey a single differential bc at one of the points @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "for instance , a right - moving _ in _ state obeys only the second bc in ( 4 ) with @xmath86 .",
    "this is equivalent to imposing the asymptotic form @xmath87 for instance , the combined bcs of the resonant and of the ( @xmath86 , _ in _ ) scattering solutions similarly lead to @xmath88 with @xmath86 , for @xmath89 we always have @xmath90 , so that @xmath91 and therefore , with the prescription adopted , @xmath92 this means that a given scattering _ in _ state @xmath93 ( with momentum @xmath86 on the real axis ) is orthogonal to any @xmath3 ( with @xmath89 ) if the momentum @xmath15 lies outside the cone with apex in @xmath26 , the inner product being divergent otherwise .",
    "viceversa , given @xmath15 , the momenta @xmath94 of the orthogonal scattering states lie outside the cone with apex in @xmath15 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "when @xmath95 lies out of ( inside ) the interval @xmath96 $ ] , and @xmath97 when @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) respectively.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the scattering states always have a reflected wave with momentum of opposite sign to the incident one , so the situation is trickier for @xmath80 .",
    "given @xmath100 , the cone to be considered is again the one with apex in the mirror momentum @xmath101 .",
    "let us suppose that , besides the barrier , there is some potential well within the region @xmath102 $ ] sustaining bound states @xmath2 with purely imaginary momenta @xmath103 .",
    "the exponential decrease of the amplitude outside the well , corresponding to resonant - like bcs @xmath104 which imply the more popular ( and weaker ) @xmath105 , may be translated into the assumption of an asymptotic form similar to ( 5 ) , namely @xmath106 which is manifestly square integrable .    following the same steps leading to ( 13 ) we now have @xmath107 the integral is convergent , yielding @xmath108 and hence @xmath109 , provided that @xmath110 .",
    "thus we have a situation similar to that occurring between the resonances , namely that the states are orthogonal if the bound state momentum , lying in the positive imaginary axis , and the resonant one , lie outside the respective divergence cones , the inner product being infinite otherwise .",
    "it might happen that , for general analyticity reasons for any general potential @xmath10 with barriers and wells within @xmath102 $ ] , the cones of the allowed bound state momenta do never include the resonant momenta , but this point would require separate investigation .",
    "together with the standard definition ( 7 ) , which yields ( finite or infinite ) real norms , we shall consider also the alternative symmetrical definition @xmath111 which arises in the convolution of the kernel ( 8) with the initial state , and yields complex `` norms '' .",
    "the calculation follows the same lines above relying on the boundary conditions : @xmath112 the result is @xmath113 for a given @xmath3 , the apex of the divergence cone is at @xmath114 so that , in particular , @xmath115 if both @xmath116 , also if both @xmath117 , and , more noteworthy , @xmath118 for any @xmath119 .",
    "only some of the products are divergent when @xmath119 and @xmath120 have opposite sign .    for the crossed products of @xmath3 ( @xmath89 ) with the scattering @xmath121 _ in",
    "_ state one has @xmath122 one always has @xmath123 , so that @xmath124 therefore the divergence cone has the apex in @xmath15 , as in the case of the standard inner product @xmath58 .",
    "for @xmath80 , only @xmath125 may lie in the sector @xmath126 leading to a divergent product , so that , for a given @xmath100 the @xmath94-states are orthogonal if @xmath26 lies inside the cone with apex in the mirror momentum @xmath101 , reproducing the same situation encountered for the standard product .",
    "because of the relationship @xmath127 between the outgoing solutions , we have @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "then the result @xmath118 is less surprising if rewrite it as @xmath130 , just a particular case of the conventional orthogonality between states with momenta in opposite quadrants of the lower half complex plane .",
    "several proposals have been worked out in the literature to deal with the divergent inner products .",
    "we quote here the one by w. romo @xcite of analytically continuing the momentum dependence of the solutions @xmath131 inside the products from the upper - half complex plane , where the ( outgoing ) function would be square - integrable , to the lower half - plane where the resonant momenta lie .",
    "this is equivalent to _ prescribe _ the finite value @xmath132 for the result of the integral @xmath133 also in the whole lower half - plane @xmath134 , where it would actually be divergent ( see the discussion in appendix ) .",
    "this approach , combined with advantages of working in momentum representation , has been followed in later works @xcite .",
    "other proposals rely on the introduction of convergence factors in the integral which are able to cope with the asymptotic exponential growth of the resonant solutions .",
    "the simple factor @xmath135 works only if @xmath136 is greater than the absolute values of the imaginary parts of given @xmath15 and @xmath78 ( which grow with increasing @xmath137 ) , so that @xmath136 can not be brought to zero without rendering divergent the integral .",
    "however it lets performing an analytic continuation in @xmath136 to its `` forbidden '' values which may be adopted as a prescription .    following zeldovich @xcite",
    ", we adopt the more powerful gaussian factor @xmath138 , which is able to overcome the growth of all the resonant solutions even for @xmath139 , and is computationally tractable @xcite@xcite : @xmath140 the functions @xmath141 are not eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian so the exact calculation of ( 27 ) requires the knowledge of the explicit form of the solutions inside the barrier",
    ".    equation ( 10 ) now reads @xmath142 according to ( a.1 ) , this regularized expression is finite for @xmath143 : @xmath144 where @xmath145 .    in the limit",
    "@xmath146 the terms @xmath147 vanish , and for @xmath148 we have the result ( a.5 ) .",
    "thus we obtain ( 14 ) in this limit , which must be intended as a prescription for the calculation of ( 13 ) .",
    "we discuss this issue in more detail in the appendix .",
    "notice that for finite @xmath149 , the exact integrals over the finite interval [ 0,_l _ ] get rather involved and the one over the resonant functions inside the barrier depends on the explicit form of the functions other than on the position of the resonant momenta .",
    "the regularization works in a similar fashion for the crossed inner products @xmath58 and @xmath150 , as well as for the symmetrical definition .",
    "we have calculated some relevant inner products involving the resonant eigenstates in the example of a 1-dimensional quantum potential barrier with compact support .",
    "this old problem is non - trivial since the modulus of the resonant solutions grows exponentially at the spatial infinity , giving rise to infinite norms and seemingly infinite inner products .    among the variety of historical proposals to circumvent these difficulties ,",
    "we have adopted a gaussian convergence factor , first introduced by zeldovich , and carried out the limit of the integrals where the factor fades off to unity .",
    "this prescription yields inner products such that most of these states are orthogonal to each other , except when they lie in a neighborhood defined by a `` divergence cone '' , in which case the product is infinite .",
    "similarly , scattering states ( with real momentum @xmath86 ) and bound states ( pure imaginary momenta @xmath151 , with @xmath152 ) are orthogonal to a given resonant state @xmath3 with momentum @xmath15 , except when @xmath26 or @xmath1530.2 cm lie in a neighborhood of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the resonant states share properties of the continuum and discrete real spectra , namely ( partial ) orthogonality and the infinite norm characteristic to the dirac states .",
    "this result is different from the full bi - orthogonality obtained by the prescription of analytically continuing the finite integrals from the upper complex momentum plane to the whole lower half plane , where the resonant momenta lie but where the integrals are formally divergent .",
    "our limiting procedure instead extends the finite result to the more modest @xmath154 angular sectors of the lower half plane close to the real axis .",
    "we differ also from earlier attempts @xcite using the gaussian convergence factor , actually limited to the products @xmath155 ( where @xmath156 was mistaken for the incoming state @xmath157 ) , in that our exact calculation yields also @xmath130 instead of a finite quantity normalizable to @xmath158 .",
    "it is interesting also the comparison with the results obtained in the friedrichs model @xcite@xcite .",
    "therefore the orthogonality and normalization properties obtained depend on the prescription adopted , although one should expect , as a signature of their consistency , that all of them lead to the same unique result .",
    "for instance , the inner self - product @xmath159 yielding the square of the conventional norm @xmath160 , which is manifestly divergent on the same footing of the scattering states , is finite for some prescriptions , whereas ours recovers the infinite result .",
    "we do not investigate here the question if a regularization by different convergence factors ( using for instance @xmath161 which would seem more natural and closer to the result of the analytical continuation prescription . on the other hand ,",
    "such a continuation in the momentum of the solutions is a non - trivial matter @xcite related to the two - sheet structure of the complex energy plane .",
    "the completeness of the scattering ( plus bound , if any ) solutions in hilbert space is not inherited by the sole resonant ( plus bound ) states in resonance expansions of the unity , and a continuum of complex energy `` background '' states must be included @xcite @xcite@xcite .",
    "any consistent unambiguous prescription for the calculation of the inner products involving resonances should be tested against the requirement of idempotence of the unity , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "it is not clear how could it happen in the analytical continuation prescriptions , where the claimed orthogonality between resonances ( or between resonant and anti - resonant states ) is of the kronecker-@xmath0 type , and the cross inner products between bound , resonant and background states have not been worked out .    we instead have orthogonality between most of the states and divergent inner products between `` neighbor '' resonant ( and continuum and bound ) states , which then have also infinite self - products consistently with the well known infinite norm of the resonances . in a general expansion involving bound , resonant ( in variable number , according to the poles encircled by the deformed integration path ) , scattering and continuum background states , showing directly the idempotence of the unity",
    "requires tackling the products involving all of these families of states . in this paper",
    "we have done part of this program and developed some regularization and calculational techniques .",
    "work is in progress on the inner products involving the resonant and the background states , aiming to the eventual cancelation of the divergences encountered .",
    "we rely on the basic integral @xmath162 which is directly related to ( 7.1.2 ) in @xcite , where @xmath163 , and hence @xmath134 , can take any complex value . notice that on completing a square in the exponent and changing the integration variable to @xmath164 one obtains the intermediate expression @xmath165    the integral representation ( 7.1.2 ) is convergent when the path of the complex integration variable @xmath166 approaches @xmath167 along a direction @xmath168 .",
    "this condition is fulfilled by ( a.2 ) as long as @xmath169 remains finite . however , in ( a.1 ) not always the limit @xmath74 ( and hence @xmath170 ) can be taken before the integration is carried out , because the function @xmath171 does not converge uniformly to the function @xmath172 when @xmath74 .    for i",
    "m @xmath173 the limit can be taken in the integrand in ( a.1 ) because the finiteness of the integral is always assured by the convergence factor @xmath174 , trivially yielding @xmath175 . in this case",
    "@xmath176 converges to @xmath177 when @xmath74 .    for real @xmath134",
    "the result @xmath178 is also well known .",
    "notice that it relies on adding to @xmath134 a small imaginary part @xmath179 , which still guarantees the convergence when @xmath74 , but later in the limit @xmath180 the result must be interpreted as a distribution .    for i",
    "m @xmath181 the integration and the limit @xmath74 do not commute . in that case",
    "we adopt the limit of the integral as a prescription . in the right - hand side of ( a.1 ) , the limit @xmath74 can be directly inferred from the asymptotic expansion @xmath182 ( see ( 7.1.23 ) in @xcite ) , namely @xmath183 which can also be numerically checked . in this way ( a.5 )",
    "yields an extension of @xmath184 to a new region of the lower half complex plane : @xmath185"
