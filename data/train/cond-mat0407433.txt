    "infrared reflectivity measurements on single crystals have been largely employed to investigate the low - energy electrodynamics of novel superconductors , like high-@xmath5 materials , mgb@xmath9 , or na@xmath7coo@xmath9 . however , the contradictory results often appeared in the literature show that such measurements involve delicate issues that will be discussed here . among them ,",
    "the most important ones are the possible contamination of the optical response of the conducting planes from the insulating axis , and the extrapolation of the reflectivity to @xmath10 both in the normal and in the superconducting phase .",
    "an example of the consequences of those issues is the present discussion , in the literature of high-@xmath5 superconductors , of their optical response in the far infrared . indeed , depending on the existence or not of features peaked at frequencies low but not null , quite different models can be applied to the still unexplained transport properties of the @xmath0 ( cu - o ) planes . in the normal phase ,",
    "experiments where the far - infrared conductivity @xmath11 is smoothly decreasing as @xmath12 lead to one - component approaches , like the `` anomalous '' , or generalized , drude model where both the scattering rate @xmath13 and the effective mass are functions of @xmath4.@xcite on the other hand , the observation of resonances , _ i. e. _ , peaks at finite frequencies in the far - infrared ( fir ) lead to charges partially localized because of disorder , or phase separation , or ordering.@xcite such resonances , that have been reported most often for la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath14 ( lsco ) , may lead the above models to unphysical predictions , like a change of sign in the carrier effective mass across the peak frequency.@xcite    in an attempt to explain such a complicated experimental landscape , it has been argued that most of the extra - drude peaks observed in the @xmath11 of lsco are spurious@xcite and caused by some leakage of the insulating @xmath1-axis response into that of the conducting @xmath0 plane . such leakage may be due either to polarizer inefficiency , or to a miscut , or bad polishing , or mosaicity of the crystals , usually grown by the travelling - solvent floating - zone ( tsfz ) method .",
    "flux - grown crystals , whose surface is intrinsically @xmath0 , should not have the above problems . however , fir resonances quite similar to those reported for the tsfz la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 have been observed in@xcite flux - grown la@xmath15cuo@xmath8 and in@xcite yba@xmath15cu@xmath16o@xmath17 ( ybco ) .",
    "unfortunately , flux - grown crystals are sometimes too small to provide reliable data at the long wavelengths where the resonances are reported to appear .",
    "thin films are large , but their optical response is affected by the optical contribution of the substrate .",
    "this is subtracted through fitting procedures , which depend upon a number of parameters and may affect the results .",
    "in conclusion , identifying a correct procedure for measuring the reflectivity of tsfz samples is of crucial importance for understanding the optical properties of lsco and of other anisotropic materials . in the next section",
    "we discuss this issue more extensively than usually found in the literature , and on a quantitative basis .",
    "we thus identify a procedure compatible with the required sensitivity , which will be applied to measurements , above and below @xmath5 , on a tsfz crystal of lsco with @xmath18 = 0.12 .",
    "from the optical point of view , lsco is a uniaxial crystal .",
    "its dielectric function measured with the radiation field @xmath19 along the @xmath1 axis , @xmath20 , is insulating - like while that measured in the plane , @xmath21 , is metallic - like for @xmath22 .",
    "those quantities are usually extracted from the reflectivity at quasi - normal incidence @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , respectively , by kramers - kronig transformations .",
    "the strong anisotropy of the crystal may cause systematic errors that we analyze quantitatively in the present section .",
    "we will refer to data taken in the normal phase at low temperature , where such errors are enhanced due to both the high @xmath0 plane reflectivity , and the narrowing of the @xmath1-axis ( phonon ) absorption .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ reflec ] shows @xmath24 for a single crystal of la@xmath25sr@xmath26cuo@xmath27 , grown by the tsfz technique and accurately controlled , as it was reported in ref . .",
    "@xmath24 was measured on the @xmath28 surface of the crystal by use of commercial polarizers ( made of polyethylene for the fir and of krs-5 for the mid infrared ) in order to align @xmath19 along @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath23 , measured afterwards on the same sample , is also shown .",
    "the resulting @xmath30 , reported in ref . and recalled in the inset , showed a strong peak around 30 @xmath31 due to a change in the slope of @xmath24 slightly above that frequency .",
    "however , a dip appears in @xmath24 at 470 @xmath31 , which indicates a `` leakage '' of the @xmath1-axis in the @xmath0 response at that frequency .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that the peak at 30 @xmath31 is also spurious as probably due to the same leakage .",
    "a check on the efficiency of the commercial polarizers employed in the experiment of ref . shows that this is not the case .",
    "indeed , the lines in fig",
    ".  [ reflec ] ( a ) report the efficiency of the polyethylene and krs-5 polarizer employed , @xmath32 . here , @xmath33",
    "( @xmath34 ) is the intensity of the field component parallel ( orthogonal ) to the polarizing direction . in correspondence with the dip in @xmath3 ,",
    "the efficiency of the polyethylene device is lower than at 30 @xmath31 .",
    "the error on @xmath24 due to @xmath35 can be expressed in terms of the misalignment @xmath36 between the electric field of the radiation and the @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) axis by    @xmath39    correspondingly , the real part of the measured dielectric function is @xmath40    by applying the linear kramers - kronig transformations to both members of the last equality , recalling that @xmath41 , and evaluating the relative error on @xmath42 as in ref .",
    ", one obtains    @xmath43    therefore , from eq .",
    "[ chi ]    @xmath44    we can now evaluate the error on the data of fig .",
    "[ reflec]-a . at about 30 @xmath31 , where the anomalous peak is observed in @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the resulting @xmath47 is 0.1% . as",
    "this systematic error is much lower than the noise on @xmath48 , the measurement at low frequency is reliable , as it was pointed out in ref . .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath49 rapidly drops to about 0.93 at 470 @xmath31 , causing a 4% deviation with respect to the real @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the latter spurious effect is not related with the observation of the resonance at 30 @xmath31 . at higher frequencies , a krs-5 polarizer with high and `` flat '' @xmath49",
    "( see figure ) provides reliable data in the mid infrared .",
    "however , usually @xmath3 is measured by cutting and polishing the tsfz sample along an @xmath0 surface and using unpolarized radiation . in order to evaluate quantitatively the systematic error in this case",
    ", we cut the same la@xmath25sr@xmath26cuo@xmath27 parallel to the @xmath0 planes within the mechanical precision of the diamond - wire saw , and we accurately polished the face .",
    "then , we measured the x - ray rocking curve on a matrix of 3x3 points of the @xmath0 surface . the width of the ( 0,0,2 ) diffraction peak was determined , and found to correspond to a mosaicity @xmath50 0.2@xmath51 .",
    "therefore , any possible source of error from the crystal quality was excluded .",
    "anther systematic error may be related , however , to the average angle of incidence under which the radiation impinges on the crystal .",
    "it will depend on the geometry of the reflectivity set - up and on the angular width of the beam , namely on the @xmath52-number of the optical device . in the present case ,",
    "the central ray had an incidence of 8@xmath51 and the @xmath52-number was 4 .",
    "therefore the maximum angle under which the marginal ray hit the surface was about 15@xmath51 .",
    "now , any deviation from normal incidence smaller than about @xmath53 does not affect the result in the fir.@xcite indeed , as the radiation enters the metallic cuprate , due to refraction it propagates very close to the @xmath1 axis .",
    "this misalignment may instead slightly affect @xmath3 in the mid infrared , where the refraction index @xmath54 decreases .    however , in fig .",
    "[ reflec]-b @xmath24 still shows an appreciable imprint of the @xmath1 axis to phonon , even if smaller than in ( a ) .",
    "indeed , by using the procedure described in the inset of fig .",
    "[ theta ] , we found out a miscut angle @xmath55 = 1@xmath56 between the crystal surface and the @xmath0 planes of lsco .",
    "the uncertainty is due to both surface roughness and laser beam divergence .",
    "we can now calculate the error @xmath47 that the small miscut @xmath55 induces on the measured reflectivity , and show how it can be reconducted within the experimental noise .",
    "the response to unpolarized radiation which propagates with @xmath57 with respect to the principal ( @xmath1 ) axis of a uniaxial crystal is an effective dielectric function@xcite    @xmath58   \\simeq \\epsilon_1^{ab } - \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\epsilon_1^{ab } - \\epsilon_1^{c})\\frac{\\epsilon_1^{ab}}{\\epsilon_1^{c } } \\theta^2 = \\epsilon_1^{ab}(\\omega , \\theta ) + \\delta \\epsilon_1^{ab}(\\omega , \\theta ) \\",
    ", , \\label{error_eps1}\\ ] ]    where the term in the square bracket has been expanded to the second order for small @xmath55 . by using again the kramers - kronig transformations , one obtains    @xmath59 = \\theta^2 g(\\omega ) \\ , .",
    "\\label{error_sigma}\\ ] ]    one wants that the systematic error due to the @xmath1-axis leakage is smaller than the standard uncertainty ( noise ) on @xmath3 ( here assumed to be @xmath60 0.5% ) .",
    "therefore , by using again the criterion in ref .",
    ", one may write    @xmath61    from the above formula one can extract the maximum misalignment to be tolerated , @xmath62 . by using at first order one of the data sets in fig .",
    "[ reflec ] , one obtains from eq .",
    "[ error_sigma ] the curve in fig .",
    "[ theta ] for our la@xmath25sr@xmath26cuo@xmath27 crystal .",
    "as one can see , it leads to a strict condition ( miscut @xmath63 ) that can be fulfilled only by the procedure described in the inset of fig .",
    "[ reflec]-c .",
    "therein , the surface is again @xmath0 , but the radiation is linearly polarized in a direction orthogonal to the plane of the miscut angle .",
    "therefore , in the new configuration one has    @xmath64    so that    @xmath65    where @xmath36 is given by eq .",
    "[ chi ] , while @xmath55 and @xmath66 are the same as in eq .",
    "[ error_sigma ] . by using the polyethylene polarizer up to 250 @xmath31 , and a krs-5 polarizer at higher frequency ,",
    "the effective deviation from an ideal @xmath0 plane is reduced by the factor @xmath67 to @xmath68 , fully compatible with the small error that can be tolerated on @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , as one can see in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ reflec ] , the dip at 470 @xmath31 , which indicates a leakage with the @xmath1 axis , has disappeared .",
    "if , moreover , the plane of incidence is such as to coincide with the miscut plane ( @xmath69 polarization ) the misalignment due to a nonzero angle of incidence is also ruled out , for any refraction index @xmath54 .",
    "this configuration was indeed selected here to obtain either the results of fig .",
    "[ reflec]-c for @xmath18 = 0.12 and those of fig .",
    "[ sigma]-c for @xmath18 = 0.26 .",
    "therein , full @xmath70 data sets for both samples are shown in the inset . between 15 @xmath31 and @xmath71 12000 @xmath31 we took as reference a gold film and at higher frequencies a silver film , both of which",
    "were evaporated _ in situ _ onto the sample .",
    "suitable corrections for the @xmath72 of both metals were introduced .",
    "the final alignment of the focusing mirrors in the reflectivity set - up was performed by use of remotely controlled motors after evacuating the interferometer . in this way ,",
    "any misalignment due to mechanical stress of the sample compartment could also be eliminated .",
    "the optical conductivity @xmath11 was extracted from the reflectivity of fig .",
    "[ reflec]-c by kramers - kronig transformations , by extrapolating @xmath2 to high frequencies as described in ref . .",
    "the extrapolation to zero frequency deserves a more detailed discussion . in the normal phase above @xmath5",
    ", most authors use the hagen - rubens ( hr ) extrapolation @xmath73 .",
    "this holds for @xmath74 in a conventional drude absorption of width @xmath75 , but may be not suitable to describe the reflectivity of the cuprates . indeed , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ sigma]-a , at any @xmath76 220 k , the hr extrapolation ( dashed line ) does not fit the extra reflectivity observed in the fir .",
    "any attempt to include this latter in a different hr fit leads to a dc conductivity , higher by at least one order of magnitude than those reported in the literature.@xcite therefore , we used at any @xmath77 a drude - lorentz fit to @xmath2 for @xmath78 15 @xmath31 , which fits ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ sigma]-a ) the slight but reproducible decrease observed below 40 @xmath31 and provides a suitable extrapolation for @xmath79 .",
    "it is our opinion that , in some previous studies , the choice _ a priori _ of an hr law for @xmath2 may have prevented the detection of peaks at finite fir frequencies in the @xmath80lsco . at",
    "frequencies higher than 20000 @xmath31 we used the reflectivity data of ref .",
    ", that were extrapolated to infinite frequency by the power law @xmath81 . below @xmath5 , different extrapolations to @xmath82 can be used . in high-@xmath5 superconductors",
    ", it is well known that only a fraction of the in - gap spectral weight    @xmath83    condenses below @xmath5 . in lsco ,",
    "such fraction is on the order of 20 % .@xcite to keep track of this evidence , a two - fluid model is often employed , where the superfluid component is modeled by a drude term with vanishingly small scattering rate , and the normal fraction is represented by a lorentzian lineshape with finite width .",
    "however , it is also assumed in general that high-@xmath5 cuprates are in the clean limit , due to their extremely short coherence length .",
    "therefore , the extrapolation law @xmath84 is probably more suitable , as it derives from the london model which describes the electrodynamics of a superconductor with infinite gap .",
    "indeed , we have made the latter choice in the present experiment .",
    "as one can see in the inset of fig .",
    "[ sigma]-b , this law provides a good fit to data down to the lowest measuring frequency , with one parameter only .",
    "both the above approaches are clearly phenomenological .",
    "an attempt to extend the bcs theory to any situation intermediate between the clean limit of the london assumption and the dirty limit of the mattis - bardeen approach ha been performed by zimmermann.@xcite    the optical conductivity @xmath11 of the underdoped crystal @xmath18 = 0.12 is shown in fig .",
    "[ sigma ] for temperatures above ( top ) and below @xmath5 ( middle ) , and compared with that measured in a crystal with @xmath18 = 0.26 ( bottom ) . in the normal phase , in the underdoped sample an anomalous fir peak is still observed , despite any possible contribution from the @xmath1 axis has been ruled out by the procedure described in the preceding section .",
    "that feature is very similar , both in peak frequency and temperature dependence , to the one measured in ref in the @xmath85 plane of the same @xmath18 = 0.12 sample , and extracted from the data of fig .",
    "[ reflec]-a . such anomaly , which is not observed in non - superconducting lsco metals with @xmath18 = 0.26 , was attributed to excitations of clusters of localized charges , possibly stripes , on the basis of phenomenological@xcite and theoretical@xcite arguments .",
    "in the present paper we have addressed an issue that is widely debated in the literature of optical spectroscopy of novel superconductors : a reliable determination of their far - infrared conductivity , in the presence of strong optical anisotropies . in cuprates ,",
    "the discussion has regarded mainly the existence , or not , of resonances at low energy that could be related to carrier localization and phase separation .",
    "slight differences in the @xmath0 plane reflectivity and in their extrapolation to zero frequency , not much larger than the experimental noise , can lead to either conclusion . in mgb@xmath9 ,",
    "the possibility of optically observing both energy gaps which are known to exist in this material will depend on the solution of the same issues . in the recently discovered `` wet '' superconductor , na@xmath7coo@xmath9.nh@xmath9o , a major problem for the spectroscopist will be the observation , in the far infrared , of a tiny energy gap in the presence of water absorption .",
    "we have then proposed here a quantitative discussion of the two main problems , above mentioned , which affect the experiments in the far infrared .",
    "we have analyzed quantitatively the error that an admixture of the @xmath1-axis contribution , due to different reasons , may cause on the in - plane reflectivity of an uniaxial crystal like lsco .",
    "we have then identified a safe procedure which has been shown to reconduct the unavoidable miscut of the crystal surface within the experimental noise .",
    "this is obtained by using a polarizer aligned orthogonally to the miiscut , which reduces the @xmath1-axis contribution by nearly two orders of magnitude .",
    "this method , applied to an @xmath0 surface of the same lsco crystal that was measured on the @xmath85 side in a previous experiment , has confirmed the observation , reported therein , of a resonance in the far infrared.@xcite we have then discussed the extrapolation of the reflectivity to @xmath4 = 0 , that is necessary to extract @xmath11 from the raw data by kramers - krong transformations .",
    "we have pointed out that the standard hagen - rubens law used for superconductors in their normal phase may erase important details that , even if relatively small , would make major features appear in @xmath86 when @xmath2 is close to 1 .",
    "the use of extrapolations based on drude - lorentz fits would eliminate this risk .",
    "finally , we have addressed the same issue for the reflectivity below @xmath5 , by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of different choices . in mgb@xmath9",
    "the bcs model has proved to provide accurate extrapolations .",
    "concerning high-@xmath5 superconductors , the models proposed and used up too now are not fully satisfactory for some reason .",
    "there is certainly a need for more detailed models which may take into account the @xmath87-wave symmetry of the pair wavefunction in these materials .      for a review ,",
