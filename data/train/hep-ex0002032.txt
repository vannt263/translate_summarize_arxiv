    "several theories and many models predict the existence of magnetic monopoles ( mms ) [ 1 - 5 ] with a magnetic charge which obeys the dirac quantization rule [ 6 ] , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an integer , @xmath1=1,2,3 ... for @xmath1=1 , assuming that the basic electric charge is that of the electron , one has @xmath2 u.e.s .",
    "most theoretical papers concern superheavy magnetic monopoles predicted by grand unified theories ( gut ) of electroweak and strong interactions ; there are also many papers concerning still heavier mms , and others concerning mms with intermediate and low masses [ 5 ] ; if the basic electric charge is that of the quark @xmath3 the basic magnetic charge increases by a factor of three .    a mm and an atomic nucleus n may form a bound system .",
    "some models predict the existence of states with both electric and magnetic charges ( dyons ) [ 7 ] . as far as the energy losses in matter , a dyon and a @xmath4 system behave in the same way .",
    "the system @xmath4 can be produced mainly via radiative capture [ 8 ] , @xmath5 , and the bound system may be subject to photodissociation [ 8 ] , @xmath6 . since the cross section for radiative capture is @xmath7 for mms with @xmath8 , it is possible that many mms [ 9 ] in the cosmic radiation can be in the state @xmath9 . neglecting the catalysis of proton decay , the mms or the @xmath9 systems with @xmath10 traversing rock , probably reach an equilibrium mixture of about @xmath11 mms and @xmath11 @xmath9 [ 8 ] .",
    "the minimum velocity of the @xmath9 system for which one may have a break - up reaction is @xmath12 ( at this value the three particles in the final state ( mm , proton and target nucleus ) are essentially at rest in the center of mass frame of the mm ) .",
    "most experimental searches concern superheavy gut magnetic monopoles and most of the published flux limits apply to an isotropic flux of bare monopoles of unit magnetic charge ( the monopole catalyzed nucleon decay is not considered ) . in order to search for mms and dyons over a large @xmath13-range it is necessary to know how these particles loose energy in different types of detectors [ 9 ] and if they can cross the earth [ 10 ] .",
    "there has been increasing interest in lower mass monopoles , such as those discussed in refs . [ 5,12,13 ] .",
    "proposals have been made to search for them at sea level and at high altitude [ 13 ] and also at the future lhc collider at cern [ 14 ] .",
    "this lecture is an update of the lectures on mms at the 1995 trieste 4@xmath14 school on non accelerator particle astrophysics [ 15 ]",
    ". here there will be a more complete analysis of the energy losses of mms and of dyons in different detectors and in the earth ; an update is made of the gut mm searches .",
    "an extensive bibliography on mms is given in ref .",
    "[ 16 ] . as a byproduct",
    "we shall discuss the searches and the present limits for nuclearites .",
    "these limits are also valid for charged q - balls , aggregates of supersymmetric particles [ 17 ] .",
    "one has to consider the total energy losses of mms and of dyons in the detectors and also that fraction of the energy loss which leads to detection . in streamer tubes",
    "this fraction is the ionization energy loss in the gas , in scintillators it is the excitation energy loss which leads to the emission of light , in nuclear track detectors it is the restricted energy loss , t. i. the energy loss contained in a 10 nm diameter around the mm trajectory . in ref .",
    "[ 9 ] a thorough analysis is made of these losses and of their dependence on the mm velocity v=@xmath13c .",
    "let us consider first the scintillators and the streamer tubes . at _ high velocity ( @xmath15 ) _ the total energy losses of mms in scintillators and streamer tubes",
    "are mainly due to ionization ; they may be calculated using the bethe - bloch formula . at _",
    "intermediate @xmath13 _ ( few @xmath16 ) the main contribution to energy losses is again due to ionization , and one uses the formula of ahlen - kinoshita [ 18 ] for nonconductors , corrected by ritson [ 19 ] :    @xmath17    the results are shown as curves a in fig .",
    "1a for mms in scintillators .    at _ low velocity _ ( @xmath18 ) the dominant energy loss mechanism",
    "is that of elastic collisions of the mm with the atoms .",
    "this contribution may be computed by numeric procedures , neglecting the hydrogen atoms ( which means that one obtains a lower limit for the energy losses ) .",
    "the results are shown as curves b in fig .",
    "1a for mms in scintillators [ 9 ] .      for mms the light yield @xmath19 in a scintillator",
    "is related to the energy loss @xmath20 by [ 21 ] @xmath21 \\cdot \\frac{de}{dx } \\label{yield}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the total electronic energy loss .",

    "@xmath23 is the the so - called quenching parameter : the light yield from the energy deposited near the track ( the first term in the parenthesis of eq .",
    "2 ) saturates for large energy losses . for @xmath24",

    "_ the light yield is thus independent of the magnetic charge value _ ; at low and high @xmath13 the light yield increases quadratically with @xmath35 .",
    "the light yields in ne110 and in the macro liquid scintillator are equal within a few percent and only one curve is drawn .",
    "the light yield at low beta is a lower limit , since the present calculations do not take into account possible contributions that arise from the mixing and crossing ( drell effect ) of molecular electronic energy levels at the passage of the magnetic charge ; this could result in molecular excitations and emission of light .",

    "these monopoles could be present in the cosmic radiation , but would not reach underground detectors , see fig .  4 [ 13 ] .",
    "detectors at the earth surface are capable to detect mms coming from above if they have masses larger than @xmath55 gev ; lower mass monopoles may be searched for with detectors located at high mountain altitudes , or even higher , in balloons and in satellites .",
    "few experimental results are available [ 30 ] .",
    "an experiment has been proposed to search for intermediate mass monopoles with nuclear track detectors at the earth surface and at high altitude [ 13 ] .",
    "classical mms have been searched for at every new accelerator up to masses of about 1 tev [ 15 ] .",
    "the main motivation is connected with the original proposal of dirac , in 1931 [ 6 ] . with the advent of higher energy accelerators , in particular of the lhc",
    ", it should be possible to search for mms with masses up to about 7 tev , a mass region which may explore the possibility of magnetic monopoles connected with the electroweak unification scale [ 26 ] . a simple experiment using nuclear track detectors",
    "is proposed to be used with the lhc collider [ 14 ] .",
    "ginzburg and schiller have proposed to analyze @xmath56 collisions at high energy colliders , below monopole production threshold [ 27 ] .",
    "@xmath56 scattering should be enhanced due to the large coupling of monopoles to photons . at the tevatron",
    "the effect could be seen as pair production of photons with energies of 200 - 400 gev and roughly compensated transverse momenta of 100 - 400 gev / c .",
    "this search could explore monopole masses of 1 - 2 tev ; at lhc the explored masses could be 7 - 19 tev .",
    "nuclearites ( strange quark matter ) should be aggregates of @xmath57 , @xmath3 and @xmath58 quarks in equal proportions and of electrons to ensure their electrical neutrality .",
    "they should be stable for all barion numbers in the range between ordinary nuclei and neutron stars ( @xmath59 )",
    ". they could be the ground state of qcd and could have been produced in the primordial universe or in violent astrophysical processes .",
    "nuclearites could contribute to the dark matter in the universe .",
    "an upper limit on the nuclearite flux may be estimated assuming that @xmath60 , where @xmath61   is the local dark matter density ; @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the mass and the velocity of nuclearites , respectively [ 28,29 ] .",
    "the most relevant direct upper flux limits for nuclearites come from three large area experiments : the first two use the cr39 nuclear track detector ; one experiment was performed at mountain altitude [ 30 ] , the second at a depth of 10@xmath64   in the ohya mines [ 31 ] ; the third experiment is the macro detector which uses also liquid scintillators besides nuclear track detectors [ 32 ] .",
    "indirect experiments using old mica samples could yield the lowest flux limits , but they are affected by inherent uncertainties [ 25 ] .",
    "some exotic cosmic ray events were interpreted as due to incident nuclearites , for example the  centauro \" events , the anomalous massive particles , etc . [ 33 ] .",
    "the interpretation of those possible signals are not unique and the used detectors are not redundant .",
    "the main energy loss mechanism for nuclearites passing through matter is that of atomic collisions . while traversing a medium the nuclearites should displace the matter in their path by elastic or quasi - elastic collisions with the ambient atoms [ 24,28 ] .",
    "the energy loss rate is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the nuclearite cross section , @xmath63 its velocity and @xmath67 the mass density of the traversed medium . for nuclearites with masses @xmath68 the cross section",
    "may be approximated as : @xmath69    it is assumed that the density of strange quark matter is @xmath70 somewhat larger than that of atomic nuclei . for typical galactic velocities , nuclearites with masses larger than 0.1 g could traverse the earth . for nuclearites of smaller masses",
    "the collisions are governed by their electronic clouds , yielding @xmath71 .",
    "most nuclearite searches were obtained as byproducts of superheavy magnetic monopole searches .",
    "the cosmic ray flux limits are therefore similar to those obtained for mms .    in fig .",
    "6 is presented a compilation of limits for a flux of downgoing nuclearites compared with the dark matter limit , assuming a velocity at ground level @xmath72 .",
    "this speed corresponds to nuclearites of galactic or extragalactic origin . in the figure we extended the macro limit above the dark matter bound , in order to show the transition to an isotropic flux for nuclearite masses",
    "larger than 0.1 g ( @xmath73 gev ) .",
    "figure 6 : 90% c.l .",
    "flux upper limits versus mass for nuclearites with @xmath74 at ground level .",
    "these nuclearites could have galactic or extragalactic origin .",
    "the limits are from macro [ 24 ,  32 ] , from refs .  [",
    "30 ] ( `` nakamura '' ) , [ 31 ] ( `` orito '' ) and the indirect mica limits of ref .  [ 25 ] .",
    "comparing this lecture at the 5@xmath14 school to that at the 4@xmath14 school [ 15 ] one notices the improvements made in this field during a 3-year period .",
    "the changes concern some theoretical aspects [ 4,7,12 ] , computation of the energy losses in detectors [ 9 ] and in the earth [ 10 ] , new searches for mms in the cosmic radiation , see fig .  5 [ 24 ] , new methods to search for classical monopoles [ 29 ] , etc .",
