    "one - dimensional organometallic sandwich polymers ( osps ) have attracted wide interests in recent years due to their potential applications in spintronic devices and information storage @xcite .",
    "one of the extensively studied systems is tm@xmath2bz@xmath3 which demonstrates versatile properties .",
    "the property diversity arises from two facts . on one hand ,",
    "the properties of [ tm(bz)]@xmath1 are highly dependent on the tm ions .",
    "for example , [ v(bz)]@xmath1 and [ mn(bz)]@xmath1 are ferromagnetic half - metals , while [ cr(bz)]@xmath1 is a nonmagnetic insulator . on the other hand , the type of organic molecules can also significantly influence the properties of the one - dimensional osps . for example",
    ", no magnetic moment appears in [ mn(cp)]@xmath1 ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ) , while [ cr(cp)]@xmath1 has a ferromagnetic ground state.@xcite it is believed that the ferromagnetism obsvered in such osps ( like v@xmath2bz@xmath3@xcite ) may qualify them as good materials for spin polarized transport.@xcite    because of the abundant magnetic properties and the possibility as candidates for spintronic devices and information storage , recently , the study on the one - dimensional osps has been extended to the cases of tm - pentalene ( pn ) , tm - naphthalene ( np ) and tm - ant.@xcite the sandwich like clusters of tm - np and tm - ant were firstly synthesized in 1999.@xcite further theoretical investigations showed that [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 is a half - metallic ferromagnet . since in [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 ,",
    "the ant are connected by two tm ions , as shown in fig 1(a ) , compared with [ tm(bz)]@xmath1 and [ tm(cp)]@xmath1 , it should have better stability and conductivity and it may be more suitable for spintronic devices and information storage .",
    "note that , previous theoretical investigation pointed out a possible structural transition from _",
    "d@xmath4 _ to _ d@xmath0 _ symmetry appearing on v@xmath2bz@xmath3.@xcite consequently , systematic investigate on this kind of polymers is quite interesting and necessary .",
    "therefore , in this work , the structural , electronic and magnetic properties of [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 ( tm = sc , ti , v , cr and mn ) are investigated by first principles calculations .",
    "we find that magnetic properties in [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 are much different from those in tm(bz)@xmath1 and the difference arises from the different homo - lumo gap of the organic molecules and the subsquent different ct between the tms and the organic molecules .",
    "especially , we find that [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ cr@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 are half metals with the 100% spin polarized density of states ( dos ) around the fermi level , which is of great importance for spin transport .",
    "full - electron density functional theory ( dft ) implemented in the dmol@xmath5 package @xcite is used in our calculations .",
    "the perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite functional is used for exchange and correlation interaction in the generalized gradient approximation(gga ) . the basis set",
    "is composed of double numerical basis and a polarized function ( dnp ) is chosen .",
    "the supercell is chosen as 20@xmath620@xmath6_c _ @xmath5 , where @xmath7 is the lattaice constant along the periodic direction and is varied for different tm cases [ see table i ] .",
    "the corresponding brillouin zone is sampled by a 1@xmath61@xmath650 monkhorst and pack grid.@xcite all structures are fully relaxed .    in order to investigate the different magnetic configurations and peierls transition in [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 , a supercell containing four tms and two ants are used . for each kind of [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 , as shown in figs .",
    "1(b)-(f ) , five magnetic configurations are considered .",
    "the combination of two characters _ xy _ ( _ x _ and _ y _ correspond to _ n_(non - magnetic ) , _",
    "f_(ferromagnetic ) and _ a_(anti - ferromagnetic ) ) are adopted for representing the related magnetic configurations , with _",
    "x _ and _ y _ describing the intralayer and interlayer magnetic coupling of tm atoms , respectively .",
    "for example , as shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) , _ fa _ means the ferromagnetic coupling between the inner layer tm atoms and the anti - ferromagnetic coupling between two nearest neighbor layers .",
    "after full relaxation , the calculated structural , electronic and magnetic properties of [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 are summarized in table i. peierls transition does not occur in [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 , and no magnetic moment is observed in the cases of [ sc@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ mn@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 . in contrast ,",
    "ti and fe are spin polarized , but the magnetic ground states of [ ti@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ fe@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 are _ fa _ and _ af _ , respectively .",
    "hence , the total magnetic moments of [ ti@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ fe@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 supercells are zero . in addition , our calculations predict that _",
    "ff _ is the ground state of both [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ cr@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 , and that the supercells of [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ cr@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 respectively possess a magnetic moment of 2.00@xmath8 and 0.96@xmath8 per tm ion , with a finite negative magnetic moment formed on the ant part .",
    "further analysis shows that [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ cr@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 are half - metallic ferromagnets which can be seen from the band structures of [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ cr@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 shown in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) .",
    "the [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 total dos and the partial dos of v 3__d _ _ are shown in fig .",
    "it is found that the 100% spin - polarized dos around fermi level mainly come from the v 3__d _ _ orbitals , with small contribution from the c 2__d__. a gap of 0.76 ev and 1.25 ev for [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ cr@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 respectively is observed in the spin majority channel .",
    "thus , [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ cr@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 may be good candidates for spintronic devices and information storage .",
    "note that our relsults on [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 presented here agree well with former calculations.@xcite    in both [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ tm(bz)]@xmath1 , tms are located in a crystal field with _",
    "d@xmath4 _ symmetry . under _",
    "d@xmath4 _ symmetry crystal field , as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , tms _ d _ orbital splits into a a@xmath9 ( d@xmath10 ) , 2-fold e@xmath0 ( d@xmath11 and d@xmath12 ) and e@xmath9 ( d@xmath13 and d@xmath14 ) orbitals . in the meantime ,",
    "both ant and bz containing 14 and 6 c atoms obey the hkckel rule , which means that a stable aromatic molecule should have 4__m__+2 carbon atoms ( where _ m _ is an integer ) .",
    "however , the magnetic behaviors of [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 are totally different from those of [",
    "tm(bz)]@xmath1.@xcite for example , [ mn(bz)]@xmath1 is a ferromagnet with 1.0@xmath8 magnetic moment per mn ions , and non - magnetic state is the ground state of [ cr(bz)]@xmath1 . whereas , this situation is reversed in [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 , since [ mn@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 do not show any magnetic moment while cr ions of [ cr@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 are ferromagnetically spin - polarized with 1@xmath8 magnetic moment . both [ v(bz)]@xmath1 and [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 are a spin - polarized sandwich polymers , but the magnetic moments of v ions in [ v(bz)]@xmath1 and",
    "[ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 are approximately 1.0@xmath8@xcite and 2.0@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "an interesting question arises from these results : why is there so big difference in the magnetic properties of [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ tm(bz)]@xmath1 ?",
    "further analysis shows that , compared with [ tm(bz)]@xmath1 , there is a larger ct between tms and ant .",
    "we find that the magnetic properties of [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 are attributed to the ct effect which was once proved to be responsible for the magnetic behaviors of [ tm(cp)]@xmath1.@xcite for example , in [ v(bz)]@xmath1 , v ( 3d@xmath54s@xmath15 ) has five valence electrons occupy the _ d _ orbitals with two and three electrons respectively occupying the _ a@xmath9 _ and doubly degenerate _ e@xmath0 _",
    "orbitals , because of two _ s _ electrons fill 3__d _ _ shell@xcite .",
    "hence , one unpaired electron exists in _ e@xmath0 _",
    "orbitals , and [ v(bz)]@xmath1 shows a magnetic moment of 1.0@xmath8 on each v ion .",
    "however , in [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 , one electron at v _ d _ orbital is transferred to ant , and _",
    "e@xmath0 _ has two unpaired electrons .",
    "thus , v ions in [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 possess a 2.0@xmath8 magnetic moment . in order to illustrate this effect more clearly ,",
    "calculations are performed , with the unit cell containing two tms and one ant and the initial magnetic coupling of two tms arranged as ferromagnetic .",
    "for each [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 , the calculated total unit - cell magnetic moments per tm are shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , in which the magnetic moments and schematic occupation of valence electrons obtained by ct model are also presented . we can find that our calculated results agree well with the ct model .",
    "furthermore , [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ tm(cp)]@xmath1 are quite similar in magnetic properties , since cp containing 5 c atoms does not obey the hckel rule , cp tends to get one additional electron from tms .",
    "therefore , ct occurs in [ tm(cp)]@xmath1.@xcite however , according to hckel rule , ant is a stable aromatic molecule .",
    "we want to inspect why there is so big ct in [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 . generally , the key factors determining the ct in this kind of polymers are : ( 1 ) the average number of carbon atom ( anc ) per tm ; ( 2 ) the strength of frontier orbital hybridization . from [ tm(bz)]@xmath1 to [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 ,",
    "the anc increases from six to seven .",
    "this small change of anc should not induce large ct difference between [ tm(bz)]@xmath1 and [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 .",
    "then the large ct in [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 might arise from the second factor .",
    "our calculations show that the homo - lumo gap of ant is 2.7 ev , which is smaller than that of bz(5.5 ev ) .",
    "comparing with bz , the lumo of ant is much closer to the homo of tm ions .",
    "thus , the frontier orbital hybridization between tms and ant is much stronger in [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 than in [ tm(bz)]@xmath1 and the ct appears on [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 .",
    "this is also illustrated clearly in figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) , where the partial dos of tm 3__d _ _ and ant c 2__p _ _ are shown .",
    "taking fermi level as the reference , the homo of both bz and ant are localized around -5.5 ev . however , as the gap of ant is smaller than that of bz , the minimum energy of hybdridization of v 3__d _ _ and c 2__p _ _ electrons in [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 is -4 ev , which is lower than that of [ v(bz)]@xmath1 ( -3 ev ) .",
    "thus , as shown in fig 3(c ) and ( d ) , compared with [ v(bz)]@xmath1 , the minority electrons of v in [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 is transferred to ant , which can also be found in [ v(cp)]@xmath1.@xcite consequently , from [ v(bz)]@xmath1 to [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 , the magnetic moment of v ion increases from 1@xmath8 to 2@xmath8 .",
    "the schematic view of this opinion is also shown in fig .",
    "3 , where the frontier orbitals ( homo and lumo ) of bz , v and ant are approximately shown in the left , middle and right , respectively . the bigger arrow means the larger ct in [ tm(bz)]@xmath1 than that in [ tm(bz)]@xmath1 .",
    "double exchange ( de ) was attributed as one of the ferromagnetic origins of the in [ tm(bz)]@xmath1 and [ tm@xmath0(pn)]@xmath1.@xcite however , in [ v(bz)]@xmath1 , the ferromagnetic state was believed to arise from the negative polarization of carbon atoms since magnetic moments anti - polarized by tms appears on benzene.@xcite in addition , in [ v(cp)]@xmath1 , the ferromagnetism originates from the ct effects since there is ct between tms and cp .",
    "@xcite in the cases of [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ cr@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 that are studied in this work , strong coupling between tms and ant within the energy range of -4 to 0 ev can be found [ see figs .",
    "2(c ) and 3(d ) ] .",
    "furthermore , the wave functions at the @xmath16 point of [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ cr@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 near the fermi level also confirm the strong tms - ant coupling .",
    "therefore , by comparing ct and negative polarization effect , it can conclude that the de may be mainly responsible for the ferromagnetism .",
    "furthermore , ant can be considered as a small piece of graphene ( spg ) with multi - bzs .",
    "spg with more benzene rings , such as coronene and pentacene ( pe ) , can also be used for constructing this kind of sandwich like nanostructures and nanowires . as a matter of fact",
    ", the sandwich like tm - corroene polymers have already been synthesized.@xcite such kind of polymers built with spg and tms may also be suitable materials for spintronic devices and information recording . except for the properties of better stability and conductivity mentioned at the beginning , as shown in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) , tm - spg polymers can be built into warped and branched strutures . in fig .",
    "4(a ) , the relaxed structure of sc@xmath17v@xmath17(ant)@xmath18 cluster are shown .",
    "as the radius of sc is larger than the that of v , sc@xmath17v@xmath17(ant)@xmath18 cluster shows a warp structure .",
    "by co - doping and introducing tm defects , warped structure can be realized in this kind of sandwich polymers .",
    "4(b ) shows the schematic branched structure constructed with pe , bz and tms . in fact , warped and branched structures already achieved in carbon nanotubes and nanowires@xcite are central to the design of nanodevices and nanocircuits . while the different shapes and versatile properties exhibited by the sandwich like tm - spg nanostructures and nanowires may qualify them as promising building blocks for spintronics devices and information storage . as the homo - lumo gap of spg decrease with the size increase of spg ,",
    "the ct effects and magnetic behaviors in the [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 may also exists in tm - spg .",
    "thus , further experimental and theoretical investigations are highly suggested in this interesting field .",
    "in conclusion , the properties of [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 are investigated by first principles calculations .",
    "as the homo - lumo gap of ant is smaller than that of bz , there is a large ct in [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 , which results in different magnetic behaviors in [ tm@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 from tm(bz)@xmath1 .",
    "especially , [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 and [ cr@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 exhibit 100% spin polarized dos around fermi level which is of great importance for spin transport .",
    "furthermore , we indicate that ct effect and magnetic behaviors shown in [ v@xmath0(ant)]@xmath1 may also exist in tm - spg . finally , due to the excellent stability , conductivity and unique shape ( like branch and warp ) that can be possibly realized , tm - spg may be prospective materials for spintronics and information storage .",
