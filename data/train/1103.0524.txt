    "in the paper , some aspects of the polytropic analysis are developed that concerned with various processes changing the thermodynamic state of flow of a real fluid and reduction of these processes to processes having a given temperature and pressure of a given real mixture at the inlet .",
    "it is shown that all parameters of the process can be converted under condition of full similarity of flow that is formulated in the paper . so dynamic similitude is achieved .",
    "every such conversion is defined after mechanical and thermodynamic properties of both the process to be converted and the given state of mixture at inlet of the reduced process .",
    "the conversions are unique , reversible , and they construct a group .",
    "an operating point of a compressor represents such process . let",
    "be given some fixed reference gas composition and reference pressure and temperature .",
    "when they are considered at inlet , they are called the reference inlet conditions .",
    "let a compressor operating point has some different gas composition and different inlet pressure and temperature . in many applications and for comparison",
    ", the different operating points must be reduced to the reference inlet conditions . in literature and practice before , by the test evaluation , by the conversion of test results to guarantee conditions and comparison with guaranted values , there was considered just well - known fan laws and conditions of similarity of flow at inlet .",
    "they allow to convert volume flow , speed and polytropic head from the operating conditions to the reference inlet conditions .",
    "however , they are not sufficient to convert the polytropic exponent , polytropic efficiency , outlet pressure and outlet temperature .    in this paper",
    ", it is shown that for any compressor operating point , a condition of similarity of flow both at inlet and at outlet defines uniquely a reduced point that corresponds to the reference inlet conditions so that there is dynamic similitude between the operating point and the reduced point .",
    "this allows to construct a conversion of all compressor characteristics from one given inlet conditions to another ones .",
    "a method for that is described .",
    "the results can be generalized achieving dynamic similitude between operating point of the compressor and the reduced point of a geometrically similar machine .",
    "the condition of similarity of flow both at inlet and at outlet is named as condition of full similarity of flow .",
    "it is to emphasize that parameters of the reduced point include not only volume flow , speed and polytropic head , for which a requirement of similarity of flow at inlet is sufficient , but also polytropic exponent , polytropic efficiency , outlet pressure and outlet temperature .",
    "let us consider an uncooled multistage centrifugal compressor with one suction as inlet and one discharge as outlet without side - flow . we suppose that hydraulic losses in diffusors and between the compressor stages , the dependence of the losses on the gas composition , roughness and reynolds number , and their influence on performance and characteristics of compressor are treated by a known way e.g. as in @xcite .    in the polytropic analysis of uncooled centrifugal compressors ,",
    "j. m. schultz @xcite defined the unique path of compression between two thermodynamic states of gas as a path with the given constant efficiency .",
    "this path plays a central role in test evaluation and design of compressors .    let",
    "be given some fixed reference gas composition and reference pressure and temperature .",
    "when they are considered at inlet , they are called the reference inlet conditions .",
    "let a compressor operating point has some different gas composition and different inlet pressure and temperature . in many applications and for comparison",
    ", the different operating points must be reduced to the reference inlet conditions .",
    "an operating point of the compressor is a point in a set of its parameters such as its inlet and outlet and intermediate parameters including gas composition .",
    "so the operating point includes two thermodynamic states of gas , namely states at the inlet and outlet of the compressor , and a path between these states .",
    "its operating inlet conditions , consisting of the operating gas composition and operating gas pressure and temperature at inlet , may be different from the reference ones .",
    "if the operating point undergoes a transformation under the action of certain rules , then the conversion result is called the converted point .    in",
    "particularly , if the conversion rules include the reference inlet conditions , then the converted point is called as the reduced point or as the reference point of compressor .    in many applications ,",
    "it is necessary to reduce any compressor point from its operating conditions to the reference conditions i.e. to convert the operating point of compressor to the reduced point of a similar machine so that similitude is achieved .",
    "it means that an operating value of every parameter that has been given , measured or calculated for the operating gas composition and the operating inlet conditions must be converted to its reduced value that corresponds to the reference gas composition and the reference inlet conditions so that there is dynamic similitude between the operating and reduced values .",
    "it is also useful to learn how to convert compressor characteristics given for the reference gas composition and the reference inlet conditions to operating ones and vice versa .",
    ", 3 contain mostly the well - known terms and approaches used before by guarantee tests and performance monitoring .",
    "it is shown that these approaches must be completed .",
    "the fan laws are the result of the conditions of similarity of flow at inlet .",
    "they allow to convert volume flow , speed and polytropic head from the operating conditions to the reference conditions @xcite , @xcite . the state of art of test evaluation , conversion of test results to guarantee conditions and comparison with guaranted values",
    "is described in @xcite .",
    "the main objective values of conversion are ( i ) effective intake volume flow , ( ii ) pressure ratio , ( iii ) power at the coupling .    however , the fan laws as well as the results described in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite are not sufficient to convert polytropic exponent , polytropic efficiency , outlet pressure and outlet temperature . for these purposes ,",
    "there were attempts to use additional suggestions such as    - invariance of polytropic efficiency ,    - a certain rool of proportionality between the operating and reduced isentropic exponents taken for inlet states and the operating and reduced polytropic exponents .    in the paper , it is shown and numerical results are provided that the last two suggestions are inconsistent and contradict each other .",
    "none of them lead to dynamic similitude .    in p. 4",
    " 6 of this paper , it is shown that for any compressor operating point , a suggestion of similarity of flow both at inlet and outlet defines uniquely a reduced point that corresponds to the reference inlet conditions so that there is dynamic similitude between the operating point and the reduced point .",
    "this allows to construct a conversion of all compressor characteristics from one given inlet conditions to another ones .",
    "the results can be generalized achieving dynamic similitude between operating point of the compressor and reduced point of a geometrically similar machine .",
    "the suggestion of similarity of flow both at inlet and outlet is named as suggestion or condition of full similarity of flow .",
    "it is to emphasize that this suggestion allows to determine all parameters of reduced point include not only volume flow , speed and polytropic head , for which the requirement of similarity of flow at inlet is sufficient , but also polytropic exponent , polytropic efficiency , outlet pressure and outlet temperature .      the coversion problem above and the condition of full similarity of flow play a role in the following applications working at the following machine configurations :    \\1 .",
    "applications for a single machine :     performance monitoring     simulation of operating points     characteristics diagnostics , i.e. determination of actual characteristics of machine     model diagnostics , i.e. determination of actual parameters of models     design    \\2 .",

    "all these applications except for dynamic simulation and optimal control are realized in the systems accord , graphicord , compressor - visualizer and compressor - characterizer as their components .",
    "the work grew out from the applications that autor set , defined , carried out or participated .",
    "some of these applications are :     accord using for steady state simulation , optimal load sharing and optimization of gas networks of any structure ;    - graphicord using for graphical user interface ; data base and spread sheet support ; scenario management ; management of the third party programs ; connection with the geographic information system ; interface and data exchange with the distributed control systems;.     compressor - visualizer using for performance monitoring and simulation of operating points of compressors , turbines , and other drives ;     compressor - characterizer using for performance monitoring , characteristics diagnostics , and model diagnostics of compressors , turbines , and other drives ;     compass using for performance monitoring , characteristics diagnostics , and simulation of operating points of compressors and turbines .",
    "historically , accord , compressor - visualizer and compressor- characterizer were developed at first .",
    "then features mentioned above , which concerned with performance monitoring , simulation and characteristics diagnostics of compressors and turbines , were developed in compass , co. bruel and kjaer , in collaboration with co. wingas transport additionally to vibrodiagnostics that compass contained before .",
    "from the side of bruel and kjaer , the work was carried out by e. andreassen .",
