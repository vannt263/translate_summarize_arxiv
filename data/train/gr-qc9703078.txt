    "the canonical methods introduced into the theory of general relativity by arnowitt , deser and misner@xcite involve a certain point of view in which spacetime is decomposed into spacelike hypersurfaces of constant time .",
    "however , there are some situations were a different decomposition of spacetime may be prefered and for these situations a new form of canonical method is required .",
    "an important example is provided by the @xmath2 decompositions of general relativity@xcite that arise naturally in the characteristic initial value problem for the einstein equations . constructing the hamiltonian along conventional lines requires singling out one of the two directions@xcite .",
    "it would be desirable to retain some advantages of the hamiltonian formalism without breaking the two - dimensional covariance .",
    "another situation of interest arises from considering the thermodynamic properties of black holes@xcite . in the usual setup ,",
    "one envisages a black hole and thermal radiation in equilibrium inside a box .",
    "the geometry on the surface of the box is fixed when evaluating the partition function@xcite .",
    "this introduces boundary terms into the hamiltonian .",
    "the origin of these boundary terms can be seen in a @xmath2 decomposition close to the boundary@xcite .",
    "we will describe a generalised canonical method that is appropriate to these situations . in the standard canonical formalism , time",
    "is introduced by foliating spacetime with spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "we will base our canonical formalism on a foliation of codimension @xmath1 , where @xmath4 , the dimension of spacetime .",
    "this gives us @xmath1 coordinates @xmath5 , not all of them timelike .",
    "for each variable @xmath6 we define @xmath1 momenta @xmath7 in terms of the lagrangian density @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are normal derivatives and @xmath10 tangential derivatives .",
    "we set @xmath11 and take the definition of the hamiltonian density to be @xmath12 a legendre transformation can be used to express the field equations obtained from the lagrangian in hamiltonian form @xmath13 these equations can also be obtained by independent variation of the variables and the momenta in the action .",
    "the case @xmath14 has a history stretching back to de donder@xcite and weyl@xcite .",
    "this has been extended to general relativity comparatively recently@xcite .",
    "the geometrical structure of the weyl  de donder theory has also been investigated@xcite .",
    "we will work within the range @xmath15 , intermediate between the usual canonical approach and the weyl - de donder theory .",
    "the most significant advantage to be gained by introducing a hamiltonian is the existance of canonical transformations .",
    "these exist also for the generalised formalism@xcite and this gives us the freedom to perform changes of variables that simplify the resulting field equations .",
    "an example of this is provided in section 4 , where we consider the @xmath2 decomposition of the einstein equations .",
    "there are also important limitations to the method .",
    "the hamiltonian density , integrated over a hypersurface , does not generate translations along the @xmath5 directions in the way that the usual hamiltonian does .",
    "this complicates the generalisation of hamilton  jacobi theory and implies that the generalised hamiltonian density does not have a direct application to quantum theory .",
    "a positive feature of the more general approach is that the momenta have a natural variational interpretation . in the usual canonical formalism",
    ", the variation of hamilton s principal function with respect to the fields at the final time gives the momenta . in section 5",
    "we see that , in the new approach , the momenta can be obtained from variation of a principal function with respect to fields fixed on a corresponding boundary .",
    "this makes the new approach a natural way of analysing the partition function for black holes .",
    "we suppose that the original manifold @xmath16 can be decomposed in @xmath17 coordinate surfaces , with coordinates @xmath5 , and @xmath18 dimensional subspaces @xmath19 . our aim is to decompose the einstein - hilbert lagrangian for the metric @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 , into a kinetic term , which has derivatives with respect to @xmath5 , and a potential term .    the decomposed metric @xmath20 can be written @xmath24 where @xmath25 belongs to the cotangent space of @xmath19 and @xmath26 to the orthogonal space .",
    "we choose a coordinate basis in which @xmath26 and the dual vectors @xmath27 are given by @xmath28 where the @xmath29 are tangential derivatives .    when a covariant expression is wanted we replace the coordinate derivative by the lie derivatives @xmath30 along @xmath27 .",
    "the tangential components of the lie derivative will be denoted by @xmath31 , @xmath32 the derivative @xmath31 is the same as the one used in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also define tangential vector fields @xmath33,\\label{f}\\ ] ] which depend only on the @xmath34 .",
    "decompositions of the curvature tensor are described in the appendix .",
    "these allow us to express the ricci curvature scalar as @xmath35 where @xmath36 also , @xmath37 contributes boundary terms .",
    "the ricci curvature scalar @xmath38 can also be expressed in terms of derivatives , @xmath39}k^j-2a^{ij}{}_aa_{[ij]a}+\\nabla_bu^b\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 contributes boundary terms .",
    "putting all this into the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , we get @xmath42 where @xmath43 the tensors appearing in the kinetic term are @xmath44m}\\eta^{kn } + \\eta^{ij}\\eta^{mn}\\eta^{kl}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ g^{ijkl}&=&{1\\over 4\\kappa^2}|g|^{1/2 } \\left(\\eta^{ij}\\eta^{kl}-\\eta^{il}\\eta^{jk}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] _ symmetrised _ as indicated by brackets in equation ( [ td ] ) .",
    "similar results to this have been obtained before .",
    "the case @xmath45 has been analysed by torre@xcite .",
    "results for general @xmath1 are quoted by cho et al .",
    "@xcite , although their lagrangian still retains terms that are second order in derivatives .",
    "the hamiltonian formalism that we develop here is a generalisation of the usual approach , with special attention to retaining the covariance along the tangential and normal directions .",
    "momenta are defined in each of the normal directions @xmath5 conjugate to the quantities @xmath46 and @xmath47 as @xmath48    we shall see shortly that these relations can be inverted when the codimension @xmath49 , enabling us to replace derivatives of fields along the normal directions with momenta .",
    "the case @xmath50 leads to the usual hamiltonian formalism with constraints .",
    "we define our hamiltonian density to be @xmath51 this can be written in covariant form using the derivative @xmath31 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 the tangential derivative , defined in the appendix , contains a connection coefficient for the normal index and the @xmath54 that appears in @xmath55 precisely cancels this coefficient .",
    "when the derivatives are replaced with the momenta the hamiltonian density becomes @xmath56 where @xmath57 is given by equation ( [ pot ] ) , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the new coefficients are obtained by inverting the matrix @xmath60 the result of the matrix inversion is that @xmath61 the explicit expressions show that the inversion is possible for codimension @xmath62 .",
    "when @xmath50 , there are @xmath18 constraints @xmath63    the hamiltonian allows us to construct the action in hamiltonian form @xmath64 the extrema of this action with respect to independent variations of the momenta @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and the fields @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath47 gives a first order set of equations .",
    "the only constraints on the momenta are the index symmetries , @xmath70k}=p^{i[ab]}=p^{(ij)}{}_a=0\\ ] ] if we vary the momenta @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 then we find that @xmath71 the covariant derivative appears here because the variation of the @xmath55 term in the hamiltonian provides the necessary connection components .",
    "these equations are equivalent to equations ( [ moma]-[momc ] ) which define the momenta .",
    "if we vary the action with respect to the fields and substitute for the momenta we obtain exactly the same equations as those obtained from the lagrangian .",
    "therefore the extrema of the action give a first order form for the einstein equations decomposed in @xmath1 independent directions .",
    "this is also true in the degenerate case @xmath50 , provided that we set @xmath63 .",
    "when the space of normals to the surface is two dimensional then some simplification occurs .",
    "it even becomes possible to fix some of the gauge freedom and still obtain the full set of einstein equations from the hamiltonian .",
    "we replace @xmath69 by new variables @xmath73 , where @xmath74 this is a canonical transformation if we take conjugate momenta @xmath75 the only term that depends on @xmath76 in the hamiltonian has the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 variation of @xmath76 leads to @xmath79 if we choose a gauge in which @xmath80 is constant initially , then @xmath81 , or equivalently @xmath82 variation of @xmath80 can be used to show that @xmath83 , and @xmath80 remains constant .",
    "variations of the terms involving @xmath84 and @xmath85 vanish and we can drop these terms from the hamiltonian .    the hamiltonian becomes @xmath56 where @xmath86 and we set @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "variation of the momenta gives the equations @xmath89 where @xmath54 depends on derivatives of @xmath34 as defined by equation ( [ f ] ) .",
    "normal indices are raised by @xmath90 .",
    "variation of the fields gives the equations @xmath91 these equations are far simpler than those derived from the action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "these equations can be put into second order form by eliminating the momenta and producing equations for the metric components .",
    "expression for the momenta follow from equations ( [ deta]-[dn ] ) , @xmath92 where the extrinsic curvature @xmath93 .",
    "if we differentiate equations ( [ dsigma ] ) and ( [ deta ] ) , @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes the traceless part of the tensor .",
    "now we use equations ( [ dp ] ) and ( [ dpi ] ) to get @xmath96 in addition to these equations we still have equation ( [ mc ] ) , @xmath97 equations ( [ e1][e3 ] ) are a complete set of vacuum einstein equations and are equivalent to the vanishing of the ricci tensor .",
    "they are second order in derivatives of the metric when used in conjunction with equations ( [ kld ] ) for @xmath98 and ( [ feq ] ) for @xmath54 .",
    "a similar set of equations , for the @xmath2 decomposition with null coordinates , has been given by brady et al .",
    "@xcite . in their case",
    "@xmath99 with the change of notation described in table 1 of the appendix , and some trivial rearrangements , the two sets of equations agree . one advantage of our more general formalism is that we have been able to derive all of the their equations from an action principal .",
    "another important example is when the submanifolds have @xmath18 commuting killing vectors and the metric decomposition is orthogonal , @xmath100 . in this case ,",
    "equation ( [ e3 ] ) vanishes identically and the equations separate , making it possible to solve ( [ e1 ] ) for @xmath68 .",
    "the solution can then be substituted into equation ( [ e2 ] ) to obtain @xmath101 .",
    "this special case includes the kerr metric and its generalisations .",
    "we turn now to the application of the canonical formalism to manifolds with boundaries , where the metric on the boundary is specified and the boundary terms that were discarded earlier will have to be included .",
    "this can be readily adapted to the situation in which only the intrinsic metric on the boundary is fixed , and we shall see how the action can be recovered .",
    "problems of this type are often encountered in the path integral approach to quantum gravity .",
    "the @xmath3 formalism can be used to decompose the action for manifolds with boundary and it has been analysed in this context by york@xcite and hawking and hunter@xcite .",
    "we will see how the generalised canonical approach leads to a new understanding of the @xmath3 case and some improvements on the previous results .",
    "because the results have applications to quantum gravity , we will make explicit use of riemannian signature @xmath102 in this section .",
    "the decomposition of the action lead to two total divergences , equations ( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) .",
    "we shall add a boundary term to the original action to cancel these divergences @xmath103 this assumes that the boundary is given by a function of the @xmath5 only .",
    "we set @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the surface form and @xmath106 is the volume measure .",
    "after canonical decomposition the lagrangian is first order in field derivatives .",
    "variation of the action gives the field equations , plus a boundary term @xmath107 the field equations can be deduced from the variational principal if the metric is fixed on the boundary .",
    "we can also take the value of the action for solutions to the field equations , calling this the principal function , then equation ( [ vars ] ) relates the momenta to the variation of the principal function .",
    "the action @xmath108 is suitable for fixing all of the metric components on the boundary but it is not yet suitable for variations which fix only the intrinsic components of the metric .",
    "we will obtain the necessary modifications to the action for the boundary shown in figure [ fig1 ] and compare this with known results .",
    "we assume that the space can be foliated by two sets of coordinate surfaces which include the boundary , allowing a @xmath2 decomposition .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows part of the boundary , where @xmath26 are normal forms and the dual vectors @xmath27 are tangential to the boundary surfaces .",
    "we let @xmath109 be the angle between the tangential vectors , then @xmath109 can be related to the metric @xmath69 by @xmath110 .",
    "comparison with the definition ( [ defk ] ) gives @xmath111 with no sum over @xmath112 .    with a @xmath2 decomposition it is possible to take @xmath69 to be conformally constant , and",
    "by equation ( [ cong ] ) @xmath113 this simplifies equation ( [ vars ] ) , @xmath114 the antisymmetry in the indices @xmath112 and @xmath115 allows us to introduce the antisymmetric tensor @xmath116 , @xmath117 the momenta can also be replaced by the extrinsic curvatures @xmath118 since this vanishes when @xmath119 , the variation of the action does not depend upon the purely normal metric components but it does depend upon the mixed components @xmath120 .",
    "we can eliminate these by using a new action @xmath121 , obtained by adding an extra surface term .    only one extra surface term , depending on @xmath109 and @xmath122 , is needed .",
    "the surface term becomes ( compare equation ( [ newaction ] ) ) @xmath123 variation of the final term cancels the @xmath120 .",
    "we can rewrite the boundary term in terms of the extrinsic curvature @xmath124 of the boundary using the definition ( [ defki ] ) .",
    "we also use the expression ( [ expc ] ) for @xmath125 , to get a familiar expression @xmath126 where @xmath19 denotes the corners of the boundary , @xmath106 the volume measure and @xmath127 is a constant . for an additive action we take @xmath128 .",
    "the corner terms were first discovered in the context of regge calculus by hartle and sorkin@xcite .",
    "they were rediscovered later with lorentzian signature@xcite . in the lorenzian case",
    "we replace @xmath129 by @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is a lorentz boost .    for the remainder of this section",
    "we will decompose @xmath121 into @xmath3 form and construct the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "we will take @xmath132 to be the time coordinate , running over a fixed interval , and @xmath133 a radial coordinate , running from zero to a fixed value @xmath134 on the edge @xmath135 .",
    "the coordinates on the surfaces of constant time will be denoted by @xmath136 , and @xmath137 on @xmath135 , as shown in figure ( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the metric becomes @xmath138 the @xmath3 and the @xmath2 form of the metric are related by @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "the first step is to construct the lagrangian .",
    "we separate the volume terms from the boundary terms and write @xmath141 .",
    "the @xmath3 decomposition of the curvature introduces divergences @xmath142 , with @xmath143 given by of equation ( [ b1 ] ) in codimension 1 .",
    "this introduces boundary terms of the form @xmath144 , which become @xmath145 boundary terms on the surfaces of constant time cancel with boundary terms already present in the action @xmath121 ( equation [ hs ] ) .",
    "combining terms on the boundary @xmath146 with @xmath121 gives @xmath147 there are also corner terms .",
    "next we replace the extrinsic curvatures using the identity @xmath148 which can be derived from from equation ( [ defki ] ) and ( [ expc ] ) .",
    "we are left with @xmath149 when @xmath128 , the corner terms cancel and this expression is the complete expression for boundary contributions to the lagrangian .",
    "the surface term ( [ cans ] ) has two components .",
    "appart from at the corners , the value of @xmath150 is fixed by the boundary conditions .",
    "however , @xmath150 includes time derivatives of the metric , @xmath151 when we take the functional derivative of the the lagrangian with respect to @xmath152 we get surface momenta , @xmath153 this suggests that the angle @xmath109 should be regarded as a momentum variable . since the value of @xmath109 on the corners depends upon the normal metric components it is not fixed by the boundary conditions .",
    "in canonical form , the surface terms ( [ cans ] ) become @xmath154 the usual adm hamiltonian can be obtained by specialising the earlier discussion to @xmath50 , setting @xmath155 .",
    "this introduces an additional surface term from a divergence @xmath156 combining the surface terms together gives @xmath157 the surface contributions to the hamiltonian are , @xmath158 variation of the full action , subject to the condition ( [ surfmom ] ) , gives the field equations with no surface terms .",
    "the term @xmath159 looks very different from the results of hawking and hunter @xcite because we have separated the momentum term in ( [ sbo ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of the action is identical in the two cases .",
    "we can further verify the existence of surface momenta by direct variation of the action @xmath121 .",
    "this gives the field equations plus surface terms @xmath160 the value of @xmath121 for solutions to the field equations gives hamilton s principal function .",
    "this will be a function of the metric on @xmath161 .",
    "equation ( [ vars ] ) shows that the principal function has a variation with support on the corners .",
    "hamilton - jacobi theory tells us that this variation has to be a momentum .",
    "it also follows that one family of constants of integration of the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation will be the initial values of the surface momenta , or equivalently , the initial values of @xmath109 .",
    "we have described a generalisation of the hamiltonian formalism for gravity that is appropriate to foliations of codimension @xmath49 .",
    "the new formalism puts the vacuum einstein equations into a first - order form .",
    "it also has a variational formulation which allows canonical transformations to be used to simplify the classical field equations .",
    "the results presented here can be extended to include matter fields .",
    "we hope that they will be valuable for finding new solutions to einstein - matter systems in various spacetime dimensions .",
    "suppose we have a metric @xmath162 on a @xmath163-dimensional spacetime @xmath16 and a sub - surface @xmath19 of dimension @xmath164 .",
    "using a set of normal forms @xmath26 and tangential forms @xmath25 we can put the metric in the form @xmath24 the levi - cevita connection @xmath165 on @xmath16 induces a connection on the tangent space to @xmath19 and we can obtain gauss  codazzi relations for the curvature .",
    "there does not exist a standard notation for these reductions and so we set out ours here .    the inverse metric @xmath166 where the vectors @xmath167 and @xmath27 are dual to the forms @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we call tensors with components along @xmath167 or @xmath25 tangential and those with components along @xmath27 and @xmath26 normal .",
    "we define the extrinsic curvature and related quantities , @xmath168 these transform like connections under changes in the normal forms , but they can be regarded as rank 3 tensors if the basis is changed whilst keeping the normal forms fixed .",
    "the hypersurface orthogonality of the @xmath26 implies that the extrinsic curvature is symmetric in the tangential indices .",
    "the tensors @xmath169 and @xmath170 are identically zero in the most familiar situation where the surface has codimension 1 and the normals have unit length . in the general case they can be interpreted as connection coefficients in the normal directions .",
    "this can be seen in the gauss ",
    "weingarten equations that follow from the definitions given above , @xmath171    we can now decompose the connection in directions tangential and normal to the surface , @xmath172 the derivatives have been projected so that tangential indices remain tangential and normal indices remain normal .",
