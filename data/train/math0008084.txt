    "these operators carry much information about the random walks under consideration .",
    "_ free probability _ is an abstract framework for harmonic analysis on the free group in the language of non - commutative probability .",
    "let us introduce briefly the terminology of the latter , which is used throughout the paper .",
    "a _ non - commutative probability space _ is a pair @xmath1 of a ( complex ) algebra @xmath2 with unit @xmath3 and a linear functional @xmath4 on @xmath2 which satisfies @xmath5 .",
    "we will usually work with @xmath0-algebras and faithful states , i.e.  positive unital linear functionals .",
    "the elements of the algebra are called _ ( non - commutative ) random variables_. the distribution of a random variable @xmath6 is given by the collection of its _ moments _ @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath9 is self - adjoint , then this corresponds to a probability measure on the spectrum of @xmath9 .",
    "the distribution of a family of random variables is the collection of their mixed moments , which abstractly can be interpreted as a linear functional on the polynomials on noncommutative variables .",
    "given a noncommutative probability space @xmath1 , the subalgebras @xmath10 are called _ freely independent _ ( or _ free _ for short ) if @xmath11 whenever @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "in the rest of this section we review some of the necessary facts from free probability theory and refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for further information .",
    "one of the basic problems is _ free convolution _ :",
    "given free non - commutative random variables @xmath9 , @xmath16 whose moments are known , compute the moments of their sum @xmath17 . from one",
    "sees immediately by induction that the mixed moments of @xmath9 and @xmath18 only depend on the individual distributions of @xmath9 and @xmath18 .",
    "therefore the moments of @xmath17 only depend on the individual moments of @xmath9 and @xmath18 , and thus the term _ free convolution _ of distributions is justified . in the case of selfadjoint",
    "random variables , once the moments are known , one can proceed to compute the spectra , see section  [ sec : selfadjointoperators ]",
    ". what to do in the non - selfadjoint case will be the subject of the rest of this paper .",

    ", the recipe goes as follows .",
    "the cauchy transform of a random variable @xmath9 is the function @xmath19 which is defined and analytic at least for @xmath20 .",
    "it has an inverse ( under composition ) in some neighbourhood of infinity which has the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is analytic and one has @xmath23 this allows in principle to compute the moments of the sum @xmath17 .",
    "however , function inversion is difficult and for non - selfadjoint operators knowledge of moments is not sufficient to determine the spectrum . for the latter , a more detailed analysis of the resolvent",
    "is necessary .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section  [ sec : selfadjointoperators ] we review the case of self - adjoint operators , where the computation is reduced to the solution of a moment problem .    in section",

    ": examples ] we present some examples of computations .",
    "we collect here some well known techniques about computation of spectra of sums of self - adjoint free operators .",
    "the main tool to study spectra of selfadjoint operators is the spectral measure and its cauchy - stieltjes transform .",
    "recall that to every selfadjoint operator @xmath24 in a @xmath0-probability space with faithful state @xmath4 one can associate a probability measure @xmath25 which is characterized by the property that @xmath26 . by faithfulness of the state @xmath4",
    "one has @xmath27 . thus knowing this measure one knows a fortiori the spectrum of @xmath24 . in order to compute this measure",
    "one has to solve a moment problem .",
    "this is usually done via the cauchy transform , which can be written in this case @xmath28 this is an analytic function on @xmath29 mapping the upper half plane to the lower half plane .",
    "the absolute continuous part of the measure can be found by the stieltjes inversion formula ( cf .",

    "let @xmath53 be the limit point of the sequence @xmath54 , then every point @xmath55 is at distance @xmath56 from @xmath53 and thus @xmath57    it is therefore enough to know the @xmath35-norm of the inverse , which in the case of a self - adjoint operator is easy to compute . for @xmath58",
    "it is @xmath59 while for @xmath60 we take the limit to get @xmath61 in terms of the inverse function @xmath62 this becomes @xmath63 for concrete examples of the use of this see e.g.   @xcite .",

    "in particular , choosing @xmath185 one can compute the coordinates of the solutions ; in fact the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a single matrix @xmath186 are sufficient to determine all the solutions , see @xcite .",
    "such an approach avoids the propagation of rounding errors which are common to elimination methods .    in order to do concrete computations in the quotiont algebra @xmath187",
    "one needs a normal forms for its elements .",

    "@xmath190 can serve as a normal form for the elements of @xmath187 .",
    "another characterizing property of grbner bases is the following . for a polynomial @xmath188 $ ] denote @xmath196 the leading monomial of @xmath191 ( with respect to the chosen monomial order ) and let @xmath197 be the ideal generated by the leading monomials of all elements of @xmath3 .",

    "there are two approaches to cope with the non - algebraic part .",
    "one is to solve the algebraic part , first and verify numerically .",
    "the alternative approach is to introduce new variables for the real and imaginary parts of @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 , and to separate real and imaginary parts of the equations , which now become purely algebraic , but with more unknowns .",
