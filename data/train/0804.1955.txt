    "there is an ongoing debate as to whether active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are triggered in the environments around galaxy clusters in excess to what is observed in the field .",

    "2004a ) , using observations covering 1.1 deg@xmath8 , find no significant difference between cluster and cluster - free fields ( molnar et al .",
    "2002 ; kim et al .",
    "2004b ) .",
    "many studies which have reported overdensities find evidence that the excess sources are agn on the outskirts of clusters and that they may trace the large - scale structure which surrounds the systems .",

    "johnson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) report a @xmath10 overdensity of agn in ms1054 - 0321 and found that the sources were preferentially located 1 - 2 mpc from the cluster center .",
    "likewise , ruderman & ebeling ( 2005 ) reported a statistical excess of agn near the virial radius of clusters after combining the source counts of 51 high - redshift clusters from the macs survey ( ebeling et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "there is also evidence that the amplitude of the observed source overdensity increases with redshift .",

    "chandra_. they found that @xmath12 of the cluster fields showed an excess of point sources and noted a correlation between the amplitude of the overdensity in the hard band and cluster redshift .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by branchesi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who examined the fields of 18 distant clusters ( @xmath13 ) . such a correlation would be expected if agn are indeed tracing the cosmic web near clusters , since numerical simulations tell us that a greater degree of large - scale structure should exist around dynamically younger clusters at high redshift ( colberg et al .",
    "2000 ; evrard et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the findings that agn may trace the filaments which feed clusters is consistent with studies that suggest the large - scale structure surrounding clusters plays a pivotal role in driving galaxy evolution .",
    "studies at low redshift have found that regions of intermediate density , such as the groups and filaments on the outskirts of clusters , already exhibit signs of galaxy transformation and reduced star formation rates ( lewis et al . 2002 , gomez et al .",
    "many of the processes which have been proposed to drive this evolution , such as galaxy mergers ( barnes & hernquist 1991 ) and galaxy harassment ( moore et al .  1996 ) , may also work to funnel gas to the central regions of galaxies initiating agn activity .",
    "thus far it has been difficult to conclusively establish whether agn are triggered near clusters and to determine the processes which may be responsible because the observed overdensities are relatively mild , resulting in a limited number of confirmed , optically identified cluster agn available for study in a single system .",
    "superclusters offer an alternative to studying individual clusters or the agn population of a statistical sample of clusters .",
    "these large - scale systems are comprised of several galaxy clusters and groups connected by a rich network of filamentary structure on scales of 10 - 100 mpc ( bahcall & soneira 1984 ; einasto et al .",
    "2001 ) , thus potentially providing large samples of agn at the same epoch .",
    "such systems not only provide significant large - scale structure within which agn may be preferentially found , but also a wide variety of environments and local conditions to help constrain the mechanisms most responsible for triggering their activity .",
    "recently gilmour et al .  ( 2007 ) used _ xmm - newton _ observations of the abell 901/902 supercluster at @xmath14 to examine the environments and optical properties of x - ray selected agn in the system .",
    "the authors find that agn are more prevalent in clusters than optical studies have suggested , in agreement with the results of martini et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2006 ) .",
    "they also note that agn host galaxies are preferentially found in areas of modest galaxy density and strongly avoid the densest regions of the supercluster , concluding that there are strong correlations between agn activity and local environment .",
    "furthermore they find that the local densities and optical colors of the agn host galaxies are more comparable to galaxy groups and the outskirts of clusters than filament and cluster - like environments .    while low - redshift superclusters like abell 901/902 have been well cataloged ( bahcall & soneira 1984 ; tully et al .",
    "1992 ; einasto et al .",
    "2001 ) and studied for some time ( e.g.  shapley 1930 ) , only a limited number of such systems are known at higher redshifts .",
    "these include a structure at @xmath15 detected in the uk infrared deep survey ( ukidss ; swinbank et al .  2007 ) , the rcs2319 + 00 supercluster of three x - ray luminous clusters at @xmath16 ( gilbank et al .",

    "( 2004b ) who find no statistically significant difference between cluster and cluster - free fields on scales of @xmath111 .",

    "matching of our x - ray source list to the lfc+acs optical catalog was carried out using the maximum likelihood technique described by sutherland & saunders ( 1992 ) and more recently implemented by taylor ( 2005 ) and gilmour et al .",
    "the method gauges the likelihood that a given optical object is matched to an x - ray source by comparing the probability of finding a genuine counterpart with the positional offset and magnitude of the optical candidate relative to that of finding a similar object by chance .",

    "if the gas which makes up the icm shares the same dynamics as the cluster galaxies , it is expected that the icm temperature should be related to galaxy velocity dispersion as @xmath181 .",
    "l04 reported that their optically selected clusters had cooler temperatures than expected given their measured velocity dispersions .",
    "the deviations were at the 4 and 5 @xmath182 levels for cl1324 + 3011 and cluster a , respectively .",
    "we revisit this issue with an improved velocity dispersion for cluster a and the first ever x - ray observations of cluster b in the cl1604 system .    since the publication of the l04 results , our spectroscopic dataset for cluster a has substantially improved ( see gal et al .",
    "2008 ) , allowing us to update the original estimate of its velocity dispersion . using a @xmath22 iterative clipping technique on 35 redshifts within 1 @xmath152 mpc of the cluster center , we measure a velocity dispersion of @xmath183 km s@xmath5 for the system .",
    "our revised value is significantly lower than the l04 estimate of 1226 km s@xmath5 determined from a sample of 22 galaxies within a @xmath184 region centered on the cluster . using the same procedure on galaxies in cluster b ,",
    "we obtain a velocity dispersion of @xmath185 km s@xmath5 for the system .",
    "in figure [ scalrel - st ] we plot the galaxy velocity dispersion vs icm temperature of the two detected cl1604 clusters , as well as several high - redshift x - ray and optically selected clusters drawn from the literature . also shown in the background",
    "are clusters from a large sample of 273 low to moderate redshift systems observed with _",
    "asca _ and uniformly analyzed by horner ( 2001 ) .",
    "their best fit @xmath175 relationship using this dataset is plotted as the dashed line .",
    "alternatively the solid line shows the best fit from xue & wu ( 2000 ) , who used a slightly larger sample of clusters drawn from the literature and observed using a variety of instruments .    using our revised velocity dispersion for cluster a",
    "we find the system is now in very good agreement with the @xmath175 relation found at low redshifts and followed by high - redshift , x - ray selected systems .",
    "the same is largely true for the two ediscs and three rcs clusters which have published velocity dispersions .",
    "the exception to this is cluster b which deviates significantly from both the xue & wu ( 2000 ) and horner ( 2001 ) best - fit relations .",
    "the deviation is significant at roughly the @xmath186 level ( without taking into account the observed scatter ) .",
    "as our spectral fits for cluster b found it highly unlikely that the system s temperature is significantly greater than 2 kev , which would place the system squarely in - line with the @xmath173 relation , an alternative explanation for the observed",
    "deviation is that the system is not fully relaxed . in that case",
    "the assumption that the icm shares the same dynamics as the cluster galaxies may not hold true .",
    "gal et al .",
    "( 2008 ) note that the redshift distribution for cluster b does shows evidence of velocity segregation indicative of either substructure or a triaxial system .",
    "they also find that the velocity dispersions of the red vs blue galaxy populations in the cluster differ by less than @xmath161 , unlike the @xmath187 difference observed in cluster a. the latter is the most isolated cluster in the cl1604 supercluster with the most prominent red sequence .",
    "if the system formed at an earlier epoch than cluster b , it is expected that the primordial red galaxy population would have had more time to fully virialize and establish a much different dispersion than any infalling blue galaxy population .",
    "the lack of a significant difference in the velocity dispersions of blue and red galaxies in cluster b may be further evidence that the system is undergoing collapse or possible merger processes , which may drive the cluster off the @xmath175 relationship .    _ the @xmath188 relation _",
    "in addition to the findings of l04 , fang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have reported that their optically - selected clusters detected in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey ( davis et al .",
    "2003 ) are underluminous relative to their measured velocity dispersions .",
    "it is expected that the luminosity of the icm should scale with galaxy velocity dispersion as @xmath189 if both the gas and galaxies are in virial equilibrium and if the gas mass is proportional to the virial mass of the system ( quintana & melnick 1982 ) .",
    "the l04 and fang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) results seem to suggest optical selection of cluster may preferentially select young systems that have not built - up a significant icm and are therefore underluminous compared to x - ray selected systems .",
    "in figure [ scalrel - lxs ] we plot the bolometric luminosity of the two detected cl1604 clusters against their measured velocity dispersions .",
    "we have also plotted the upper limits obtained for each system in the supercluster that went undetected , but for which we have measured velocity dispersions of galaxies within 1 @xmath152 mpc of the cluster centers . also shown",
    "are several high - redshift x - ray and optically selected clusters drawn from the literature which have published velocity dispersions . having corrected for the expected self - similar evolution",
    ", we compare the high redshift observations to the best - fit local relationship of xue & wu ( 2000 ) and the low redshift sample of horner ( 2001 ) . using our revised velocity dispersion for cluster a , we find the system is fully consistent with the @xmath188 relation .",
    "the same is true for the clusters which we did not detect in our observations given the upper limits on their x - ray luminosities .",
    "cluster b exhibits the greatest deviation ( at the @xmath10 level ) , but given the observed scatter about the best - fit , we conclude the system is consistent with the relationship .    from our results and those of other optically - selected cluster surveys summarized in figure [ scalrel - lxs ] , we conclude that we do not observe a systematic deviation of optically - selected clusters from the @xmath188 relation .",
    "regarding the deviation observed by fang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we simply point out that the systems that deviated most significantly from the @xmath188 relation were also the systems whose velocity dispersions were determined using as few as three member galaxies . given the challenges of measuring accurate velocity dispersions at high redshift with dozens of redshifts ( see discussion in gal et al .",
    "2008 ) , we feel these clusters require further observations before it can be conclusively determined whether they fall significantly off the @xmath188 relationship .",
    "we have presented the results of _ chandra _ observations of the cl1604 supercluster at @xmath16 , the largest such structure mapped at redshifts approaching unity , with the most constituent clusters and groups and the largest number of spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies . over nearly two acis - i pointings",
    "we find a @xmath1 excess of x - ray point sources in the hard@xmath88 band , while no such overdensity is observed in the soft band . at a flux of @xmath108 erg s@xmath5 @xmath65 ( 2 - 10 kev ) ,",
    "the surface density of hard sources is 1.47 times greater than that of a blank field , in excellent agreement with the correlation between cluster redshift and source overdensity observed by cappelluti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . unlike many previous reports",
    ", the overdensity persists when integrated over nearly two full acis - i pointings , making it unlikely the excess is solely due to statistical fluctuations in the source counts .",
    "if the excess sources are tracing substructure within the cl1604 system , then this observation supports the notion that more obscured , harder x - ray sources are more highly biased tracers of large - scale structure than their softer counterparts .    using a maximum likelihood technique",
    "we have matched 112 of the 161 detected x - ray point sources to optical counterparts found in our palomar 5m - lfc and _ hst_-acs imaging , of which 42 have spectroscopic information available .",
    "we find 15 sources that are associated with the supercluster , all of which have rest - frame luminosities consistent with emission from agn activity .",
    "the supercluster agn largely avoid the densest regions of the system and are instead distributed on the outskirts of massive clusters or within poorer clusters and groups .",
    "we find a large fraction of the agn in or near cluster c. the system has a modest velocity dispersion ( @xmath190 kms @xmath5 ) and we do not detect diffuse emission from the system in these observations . despite the high density of galaxies in cluster a and extensive spectroscopic coverage of the system , we find no agn in or near the cluster . on the other hand sources",
    "are found on the outskirts of cluster b , which has an equally high velocity dispersion and a luminous icm .",
    "the primary difference between the two clusters noted by gal et al .",
    "( 2008 ) is that cluster a appears fully relaxed , while cluster b shows signs of velocity substructure indicative of a recent merger or a significant population of actively accreting galaxies .",
    "it is possible that the more complex dynamical state of cluster b leads to increased galaxy interactions and/or mergers on the outskirts of the system which may trigger enhanced agn activity .",
    "we have detected diffuse emission from clusters a and b , while the remaining five clusters and groups in the supercluster show no significant emission above the background .",
    "we find that clusters a and b have bolometric luminosities of @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 and gas temperatures @xmath6 and @xmath7 kev , respectively .",
    "using updated velocity dispersions from gal et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we find that the properties of cluster a agree well with both x - ray - x - ray and x - ray - optical cluster scaling relations followed by high - redshift , x - ray selected galaxy clusters . on the other hand",
    "we find clusters b deviates from the @xmath175 relationship at the @xmath176 level .",
    "this may be due to the system s complex dynamical state , indicating the cluster is not fully relaxed and may still be in the process of forming .",

    "<S> acis - i pointings we examine both the x - ray point source population and the diffuse emission from individual clusters in the system . </S>",

    "<S> chandra_. no such excess is observed in the soft band ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hard - band source density is 1.47 times greater than that of a blank field , in agreement with the previously reported correlation between overdensity amplitude and cluster redshift . using a maximum likelihood technique </S>",
    "<S> we have matched 112 of the 161 detected x - ray point sources to optical counterparts and found 15 sources that are associated with the supercluster . </S>",
    "<S> all 15 sources have rest - frame luminosities consistent with emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the supercluster agn largely avoid the densest regions of the system and are instead distributed on the outskirts of massive clusters or within poorer clusters and groups . </S>",
    "<S> we have also detected diffuse emission from two of the eight clusters and groups in the system , clusters cl1604 + 4304 and cl1604 + 4314 . the systems have bolometric luminosities of @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 and gas temperatures of @xmath6 and @xmath7 kev , respectively . using updated velocity dispersions </S>",
    "<S> , we compare the properties of these systems to the cluster scaling relations followed by other x - ray and optically selected galaxy clusters at high redshift . </S>"
