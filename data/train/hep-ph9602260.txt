    "there has been interest in problems at the interface of cosmology and particle physics for over thirty years ( see zeldovich 1965 ) , but it is only in the past decade or so that the subject has received serious attention ( see brner 1988 , collins 1989 , kolb and turner 1990 , ellis 1993 ) .",
    "cosmology , once considered to be outside the mainstream of physics and chiefly of interest to astronomers and applied mathematicians , has become a _ physical _ subject , largely due to the advances which have been made on the observational front ( see weinberg 1972 , peebles 1993 ) .",
    "it has become increasingly clear that particle physicists can no longer afford to ignore the cosmological `` laboratory '' , which offers a powerful probe of new physical phenomena far beyond the reach of terrestrial laboratories ( see steigman 1979 , dolgov and zeldovich 1981 ) .",
    "cosmological phenomena have thus come under detailed scrutiny by particle physicists , prompting deeper theoretical analyses ( see weinberg 1980 , wilczek 1991 ) as well as ambitious observational programmes ( see sadoulet 1992 , kolb and peccei 1995 ) .",
    "the increasing interaction between particle physics and cosmology has largely resulted from the establishment of ` standard models ' in both fields which satisfactorily describe all known phenomena but whose very success , paradoxically , establishes them as intrinsically incomplete pictures of physical reality .",
    "our reconstruction of the history of the universe in emphasizes the interdependence of these models .",
    "the familiar physics of electromagnetism , weak interactions and nuclear reactions provide a sound basis for the standard big bang cosmology up to the beginning of the nucleosynthesis era , when the universe was about @xmath3 old . the standard @xmath2 model ( sm ) of particle physics ( see cheng and li 1984 , kane 1987 ) ,",
    "brilliantly confirmed by all experiments to date ( see burkhardt and steinberger 1991 , bethke and pilcher 1992 ) , allows us to extrapolate back further , to @xmath4 sec .",
    "two phase transitions are believed to have occurred in this interval , although a detailed understanding of their dynamics is still lacking ( see kapusta 1988 , yaffe 1995 ) .",
    "the first is associated with the confinement of quarks into hadrons and chiral symmetry breaking by the strong interactions at @xmath5 , and the second with the spontaneous breaking of the unified electroweak symmetry to electromagnetism , @xmath6 at @xmath7 , when all known particles received their masses through the higgs mechanism . to go beyond this point",
    "requires an extension of the sm ; indeed , the very success of the model demands such new physics .    similarly , the standard cosmological model of an adiabatically expanding , homogeneous and isotropic universe requires extreme fine tuning of the initial conditions of the big bang , as emphasized by dicke and peebles ( 1979 ) .",
    "the problem essentially consists of explaining why the universe is as old ( @xmath8 ) or as large ( @xmath9 ) as it is today , relative to the planck time ( @xmath10 ) or the planck length ( @xmath11 ) , which are the appropriate physical scales governing gravitational dynamics .",
    "although a resolution of this may have to await progress in our understanding of quantum gravity ( see penrose 1979 , 1989 ) , there has been enthusiastic response to the simpler solution proposed by guth ( 1981 ) , viz . that there was a period of non - adiabatic accelerated expansion or ` inflation ' , possibly associated with a phase transition in the early universe",
    "( see linde 1990 ) .",
    "this has the additional advantage that it naturally generates a nearly scale - invariant ` harrison - zeldovich ' spectrum of scalar density fluctuations ( see mukhanov 1992 ) which can seed the growth of the observed large - scale structure in the expanding universe ( see efstathiou 1990 , padmanabhan 1993 ) .",
    "another fundamental problem of the standard cosmology is that the observed abundance of baryonic matter is @xmath12 times greater than the relic abundance expected from a state of thermal equilibrium , while no antimatter is observed ( see steigman 1976 ) , thus requiring a primordial asymmetry between matter and anti - matter . to generate",
    "this dynamically requires new physics to violate baryon number ( @xmath13 ) and charge - parity ( @xmath14 ) at high temperatures , in an out - of - equilibrium situation to ensure time asymmetry ( sakharov 1967 , see cohen 1994 , rubakov and shaposhnikov 1996 ) .",
    "more recently , it has been recognized that baryons are probably a minor constituent of the universe , since all observed structures appear to be dominated by dark matter ( see binney and tremaine 1987 , peebles 1993 ) which is probably non - baryonic .",
    "the growing interest in the early universe stems from the realization that extensions of physics beyond the sm naturally provide the mechanisms for processes such as inflation and baryogenesis , as well as new particle candidates for the dark matter .",
    "these exciting developments have been discussed in a number of schools and conferences ( see e.g. gibbons 1983 , setti and van hove 1984 , kolb 1986b , piran and weinberg 1986 , alvarez 1987 , hinchliffe 1987 , de rjula 1987 , unruh and semenoff 1988 , yoshimura 1988 , peacock 1990 , nilsson 1991 , sato and audoze 1991 , nanopoulos 1991 , sanchez and zichichi 1992 , akerlof and srednicki 1993 , astbury 1995 ) .",
    "such new physics is in fact necessary to address the theoretical shortcomings of the standard model itself ( see ross 1984 , mohapatra 1992 ) .",
    "its phenomenological success requires that the higgs boson , which gives masses to all known particles , can not itself be much more massive than its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) which sets the electroweak ( ` fermi ' ) scale , @xmath15 .",
    "this creates the ` naturalness ' or ` hierarchy ' problem , viz",
    ". why is the higgs mass not pushed up to the planck mass ( @xmath16 ) due to the _ quadratically _ divergent radiative corrections it receives due to its couplings to all massive particles ?",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) addresses this problem by imposing a symmetry between bosons and fermions which makes such radiative corrections cancel to zero .",
    "this requires all known particles ( boson / fermion ) to have supersymmetric ( fermion / boson ) partners distinguished by a new quantum number called @xmath17-parity ; if it is conserved , the lightest supersymmetric particle would be stable .",
    "supersymmetry must be broken in nature since known particles do not have supersymmetric partners of the same mass .",
    "however the higgs mass would still be acceptable if the scale of susy breaking ( hence the masses of the supersymmetric partners ) is not much beyond the fermi scale .",
    "when such breaking is realized _ locally _ , as in gauge theories , a link with general coordinate transformations , i.e. gravity , emerges ; this is supergravity ( sugra ) ( see van nieuwenhuizen 1981 , wess and bagger 1993 ) .",
    "technicolour is an alternative approach in which the offending _ elementary _ higgs particle is absent ( see farhi and susskind 1981 , kaul 1983 ) ; electroweak symmetry breaking is now seen as a dynamic phenomenon ( see king 1995 , chivukula 1995 ) , akin to the breaking of chiral symmetry by the strong interactions .",
    "however no realistic technicolour model has been constructed satisfying all experimental constraints , in particular the small radiative corrections to sm parameters measured at ( see lane 1993 ) .",
    "another conundrum is that @xmath14 is known to be well conserved by the strong interactions , given the stringent experimental upper limit on the neutron electric dipole moment , whereas qcd , the successful theory of this interaction , contains an arbitrary @xmath14 violating parameter .",
    "an attractive solution is to replace this parameter by a field which dynamically relaxes to zero  the axion ( see kim 1987 , cheng 1988 ) .",
    "this is a pseudo - goldstone boson generated by the breaking of a new global @xmath18 ` peccei - quinn ' symmetry at a scale @xmath19 ( see peccei 1989 ) .",
    "this symmetry is also explicitly broken by qcd instanton effects , hence the axion acquires a small mass @xmath20 when the temperature drops to @xmath21 .",
    "the mixing with the pion makes the axion unstable against decay into photons ; negative experimental searches for decaying axions then constrain @xmath19 to be beyond the fermi scale , implying that axions are light enough to be produced in stellar interiors . considerations of stellar cooling through axion emission imply @xmath22 gev , which _ requires _ the axion ( if it exists ! ) to have an interesting cosmological relic density ( see raffelt 1990 , turner 1990 ) .",
    "yet another motivation for going beyond the standard model is the unification of forces .",
    "grand unified theories ( guts ) of the strong and electroweak interactions at high energies also provide a physical need for inflation in order to dilute the embarrassingly large abundance of magnetic monopoles expected to be created during the breaking of the unified symmetry ( see preskill 1984 ) .",
    "unification naturally provides for baryon and lepton number violation ( see langacker 1981 , costa and zwirner 1986 ) which allows for generation of the cosmological baryon asymmetry ( see kolb and turner 1983 ) as well as masses for neutrinos ( see mohapatra and pal 1991 ) .",
    "recent data from on the evolution of the gauge interaction couplings with energy indicate that such unification can occur at @xmath23 gev , but only in a ( broken ) supersymmetric theory with superparticle masses at around the fermi scale ( see dimopoulos 1994 , ellis 1995 ) .",
    "moreover in such unified models , electroweak symmetry breaking via the higgs mechanism is driven quite naturally by supersymmetry breaking ( see ibez and ross 1993 ) .",
    "a dynamical understanding of how supersymmetry itself is broken is expected to come from the theory of superstrings , the most ambitious attempt yet towards a finite quantum theory of gravity and its unification with all other forces ( see green 1987 ) . following the initial euphoria over the discovery of the anomaly - free heterotic superstring",
    ", progress has been difficult due to the problems of relating low energy physics to the higher dimensional world which is the natural domain of the string .",
    "however explicit examples of compactified four - dimensional strings have been constructed which reduce to a supersymmetric version of the standard model at low energies and also contain additional gauge bosons and gauge singlets which have only gravitational couplings to matter ( see dine 1988 , 1990 , ibez 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore , the recent exciting discoveries of the special ` duality ' properties of string theories ( see giveon 1994 , polchinski 1996 ) have begun to provide important insights into the issue of supersymmetry breaking ( see zwirner 1996 ) .",
    "it is thus a common feature of new physics beyond the fermi scale to predict the existence of new particles which are unstable in general but some of which may be stable by virtue of carrying new conserved quantum numbers .",
    "moreover their generic weak interactions ensure a cosmologically significant relic density ( see primack 1988 , turner 1991 ) .",
    "in addition , known particles such as neutrinos , although strictly massless in the standard model , may acquire masses from such new physics , enabling them also to be candidates for dark matter .",
    "conventionally , particle physicists look for new physics either by directly attempting to produce the new particles in high energy collisions at accelerators or by looking for exotic phenomena such as nucleon instability or neutrino masses . in this context , the standard cosmology , in particular big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , provides an important new testing ground for new physics and , indeed , in many cases , provides the _ only _ `` experimental '' means by which the properties of new particles may be restricted ( see sarkar 1985 , 1986 ) . whether or not one finds this satisfactory from a philosophical point of view , it is essential for this enterprise that we have the best possible understanding of the cosmological laboratory .",
    "this review presents the current status and is primarily aimed at particle physicists , although it is hoped that astrophysicists and cosmologists will also find it useful .",
    "a decade or more ago , it was possible for reviewers ( e.g. steigman 1979 , dolgov and zeldovich 1981 ) to give a comprehensive discussion of all constraints on fundamental physics from cosmological considerations and many of the key papers could be found in one collection ( zee 1982 ) . subsequently several hundred papers on this subject have been published . for reasons of space",
    "we will restrict ourselves to a discussion of the constraints which follow from bbn alone but , for completeness , present all the neccessary cosmological background  both theory and observations . rather than engage in a detailed critique of every published work , we present a pedagogical discussion of the basic physics , together with a summary of the key observational inputs , so that readers can assess the reliability of these constraints .",
    "raffelt ( 1990 ) has presented a model review of this form which deals with astrophysical methods for constraining novel particle phenomena .",
    "a similar discussion of all types of cosmological constraints , including those deduced from the observed hubble expansion and the @xmath0 blackbody radiation as well as other radiation backgrounds , will appear in sarkar ( 1997 ) .",
    "we begin by outlining in the basic features of the standard big bang cosmological model and then discuss the thermodynamics of the early radiation - dominated era . in",
    "we present the essential physics of the bbn era and then discuss the observational data in some detail , highlighting the sources of uncertainty .",
    "we argue for the consistency of the standard model and briefly mention possible variations .",
    "this sets the stage for deriving general constraints in on both relativistic and non - relativistic hypothetical particles which may be present during nucleosynthesis .",
    "finally , for the benefit of particle physicists we illustrate in how such cosmological arguments have complemented experimental searches for physics beyond the standard model , particularly in the neutrino sector , and also provided entirely new probes of such physics , e.g. technicolour and supersymmetry .",
    "we also discuss the implications for the nature of the dark matter .",
    "it appears to be a widely held belief that cosmological data are not particularly accurate and the associated errors uncertain , so that the derived constraints can not compare in reliability with those obtained in the laboratory .",
    "although not entirely incorrect , this view is being increasingly challenged by modern observations ; for example measurements of the background radiation temperature and anisotropy , the cosmic abundance of helium are now routinely quoted to several significant figures .",
    "correspondingly there has been a growing appreciation of the systematic effects involved in the analysis of cosmological observations and careful attempts at their estimation .",
    "more importantly , cosmological data , even if more imprecise than accelerator data , are often much more _ sensitive _ to novel particle phenomena ; for example , even a crude upper limit on the present energy density of the universe suffices to bound the masses of relic neutrinos to a level which improves by several orders of magnitude over precise laboratory experiments .",
    "nevertheless , one should be cautious about rejecting an interesting theoretical possibility on the basis of a restrictive cosmological constraint ( e.g. the bound on the number of neutrino - like particles present during bbn ) without a critical appreciation of the underlying assumptions .",
    "we have tried wherever possible to clarify what these assumptions are and to refer to expert debate on the issues involved .",
    "( in writing down numerical values where errors are not quoted , the symbols @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 indicate equality to within a factor of 10 , factor of 2 and @xmath27 , respectively . )",
    "due to space limitations , the references are not comprehensive but do include the seminal papers and recent reviews from which the intervening literature can be traced .",
    "we have used ` natural ' units ( @xmath28 ) although astronomical units such as year , megaparsec or solar mass are given where convenient .",
    "( for reference , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 . )",
    "astronomical quantities are listed in allen ( 1973 ) and lang ( 1992 ) , while clarification of unfamiliar astrophysical terms may be sought in the excellent textbooks by shu ( 1981 ) , mihalas and binney ( 1981 ) and longair ( 1981 ) .",
    "the standard big bang cosmological model assumes that the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic , an assumption originally dignified as the ` cosmological principle ' ( milne 1935 ) .",
    "subsequently cosmological observations have provided empirical justification for this assumption as reviewed by peebles ( 1980 ) .",
    "astronomical observations in the last decade have required a reappraisal of this issue with the discovery of cosmic structures on very large spatial scales .",
    "however careful studies of the clustering of galaxies and of the small angular fluctuations in the @xmath0 cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have established ( see peebles 1993 ) that the universe is indeed homogeneous when averaged on scales exceeding a few hundred mpc , out to spatial scales comparable to its present `` size '' of several thousand mpc .",
    "homogeneity and isotropy considerably simplify the mathematical description of the cosmology since all hypersurfaces with constant cosmic standard time   or the blackbody radiation temperature @xmath34 , which are believed to be monotonically decreasing everywhere due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "knowledge of the function @xmath35 requires further assumptions , for example that the expansion is adiabatic . ]",
    "are then maximally symmetric subspaces of the whole of space - time and all cosmic tensors ( such as the metric @xmath36 or energy - momentum @xmath37 ) are form - invariant with respect to the isometries of these surfaces ( see weinberg 1972 ) .",
    "these symmetries enable a relatively simple and elegant description of the dynamical evolution of the universe .",
    "although the mathematical complexities of general relativity do allow of many exotic possibilities ( see hawking and ellis 1973 ) , these appear to be largely irrelevant to the physical universe , except perhaps at very early epochs .",
    "there are many pedagogical accounts of relativistic cosmology ; to keep this review self - contained we reiterate the relevant points .    for a homogeneous and isotropic evolving space - time",
    ", we can choose comoving spherical coordinates ( i.e. constant for an observer expanding with the universe ) in which the proper interval between two space - time events is given by the robertson - walker ( r - w ) metric @xmath38 .\\ ] ] here @xmath39 is the cosmic scale - factor which evolves in time describing the expansion ( or contraction ) of the universe and @xmath40 is the 3-space curvature signature which is conventionally scaled ( by tranforming @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) to be @xmath43 , @xmath44 or @xmath45 corresponding to an elliptic , euclidean or hyperbolic space . and infinite or have the topology of a 3-torus ( @xmath46 ) and be finite in extent ; however the latter possibility has recently been severely constrained by the non - observation of the expected characteristic pattern of fluctuations in the cmb ( starobinsky 1993 , stevens 1993 ) . ]",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is then required to be of the ` perfect fluid ' form @xmath47 in terms of the pressure @xmath48 , the energy density @xmath49 and the four - velocity @xmath50 .",
    "( here and below , we follow the sign conventions of weinberg ( 1972 ) . )",
    "the einstein field equations relate @xmath37 to the space - time curvature @xmath51 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the ricci tensor and @xmath54 is the curvature scalar . for the present case these equations simplify to yield the friedmann - lema^tre ( f - l ) equation for the normalized expansion rate @xmath55 , called the hubble parameter , @xmath56 as well as an equation for the acceleration @xmath57 further , the conservation of energy - momentum @xmath58 implies   clearly decreases ( for positive p ) in an expanding universe due to work done against the gravitational field . in fact , we can not in general even define a conserved total energy for matter plus the gravitational field unless space - time is asymptotically minkowskian , which it is _ not _ for the r - w metric ( see witten 1981a ) . ] @xmath59 this can also be derived from and since and are related by the bianchi identities : @xmath60    in principle we can add a cosmological constant , @xmath61 , to the field equation , which would appear as an additive term @xmath62 on the rhs of the f - l equations and .",
    "this is equivalent to the freedom granted by the conservation equation to scale @xmath63 , so that @xmath64 can be related to the energy - density of the vacuum ( see weinberg 1989 ) : @xmath65 empirically @xmath64 is consistent with being zero today ; in natural units @xmath66 ( see carroll 1992 ) .",
    "however the present vacuum is known to violate symmetries of the underlying gauge field theory , e.g. the @xmath67 symmetry of the electroweak interaction and ( very probably ) the symmetry unifying the @xmath68 and electroweak interactions in a gut ( see ross 1984 ) .",
    "these symmetries would have been presumably restored at sufficiently high temperatures in the early universe and a finite value of @xmath64 associated with the symmetric or false vacuum ( see linde 1979 ) .",
    "( there are also other ways , not associated with symmetry breaking , in which the universe may have been trapped in a false vacuum state . )",
    "this possibility is exploited in the inflationary universe model of guth ( 1981 ) and its successors ( see linde 1984 , 1990 , olive 1990a ) , wherein the ( approximately constant ) vacuum energy drives a huge increase of the scale - factor during the transition to the true vacuum and is then converted during ` reheating ' into interacting particles , thus accounting for the large entropy content of the universe , which is otherwise unexplained in the standard cosmology .",
    "knowing the equation of state , @xmath69 , @xmath49 can now be specified as a function of @xmath17 . for non - relativistic particles ( ` matter ' or ` dust ' ) with @xmath70 , @xmath71 reflecting the dilution of density due to the increasing proper volume . for relativistic particles ( ` radiation ' ) with @xmath72 , an additional factor of @xmath73 enters due to the redshifting of the momentum by the expansion : @xmath74 in the modern context , it is also relevant to consider the contribution of ` vacuum energy ' ( i.e. a cosmological constant ) for which the equation of state , dictated by lorentz - invariance of the energy - momentum tensor , is @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 this completes the specification of the ensemble of friedmann - lema^tre - robertson - walker ( f - l - r - w ) models .",
    "( as a historical note , friedmann presented the dynamical equation only for the case of pressureless dust , while lema^tre extended it to include the case of radiation and also wrote down the conservation equation . )    taking @xmath77 , the curvature term @xmath78 in is positive , zero or negative according as @xmath49 is greater than , equal to or less than the critical density @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the density parameter .",
    "the critical density today is   on any quantity denotes its present value . ]",
    "@xmath81 where @xmath82 , the hubble constant , is defined in terms of the present expansion rate , @xmath83 the extragalactic distance scale is set by @xmath84 since a measured redshift @xmath85 is assumed to correspond to the distance @xmath86 .",
    "( this is an approximate relationship , since it is the recession velocity , not the redshift , which is truly proportional to distance for the r - w metric ( see harrison 1993 ) , hence corrections are neccessary ( see weinberg 1972 ) for cosmologically large distances . )",
    "the major observational problem in obtaining @xmath84 is the uncertainty in determining cosmological distances ( see rowan - robinson 1985 , 1988 , jacoby 1992 , huchra 1992 , van den bergh 1992 , 1994 , fukugita 1993 ) .",
    "different estimates , while often inconsistent within the stated errors , generally fall in the range @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath88 the _ hubble space telescope _ has recently provided the means to directly calibrate various techniques through observations of cepheid variables in distant galaxies ( see kennicutt 1995 ) . according to the review by hogan ( 1996 ) , the central values obtained by the most reliably calibrated methods lie in the range @xmath89 , although there is , as yet , no consensus among observers .",
    "this issue may soon be resolved by new techniques such as measurements of time delays between variations in multiple images of gravitationally lensed quasars ( kundic 1995 , see blandford and narayan 1992 ) or of the ` sunyaev - zeldovich ' effect on the cmb by the x - ray emitting plasma in clusters of galaxies ( birkinshaw and hughes 1994 , see rephaeli 1990 ) , which bypass the traditional error - prone construction of the ` cosmological distance ladder ' .",
    "since @xmath90 is positive for both matter and radiation , @xmath91 is always negative ( see ) , hence the present age is bounded by the hubble time @xmath92 corresponding to a present hubble radius of @xmath93 which sets the _ local _ spatial scale for the universe .",
    "another scale , which depends on the past evolutionary history , is set by the finite propagation velocity of light signals .",
    "consider a ray emitted at time @xmath94 which has just reached us at time @xmath95 : @xmath96 since @xmath97 as @xmath98 , for both non - relativistic and relativistic particles , the above integral converges as @xmath99 .",
    "this indicates ( see rindler 1977 ) that there are sources from which light has not yet reached us , which are said to lie beyond our particle horizon , at proper distance @xmath100 where @xmath101 for @xmath102 ( taking @xmath103 ) .",
    "this creates a problem for the standard cosmology because looking back to earlier times we observe regions which were outside each other s ( shrinking ) horizons , but which nevertheless appear to be well - correlated .",
    "consider the photons of the @xmath0 microwave background radiation which have been propagating freely since @xmath104 ; the particle horizon at that epoch subtends only @xmath105 on the sky , yet we observe the radiation arriving from all directions to have the same temperature to within 1 part in about @xmath106 .",
    "this problem too is solved in the inflationary universe ( guth 1981 ) where the energy density becomes dominated by a positive cosmological constant at early times .",
    "the _ accelerated _ growth of @xmath39 ( @xmath107 for @xmath75 ) then rapidly blows up a region small enough to be causally connected at that time into the very large universe we see today .",
    "returning to the standard cosmology , the future evolution is determined by the sign of @xmath40 , or equivalently , the value of @xmath80 ( assuming @xmath77 ) . for @xmath108",

    "for @xmath113 , @xmath109 drops to zero at @xmath114 after which @xmath17 begins decreasing .",
    "thus @xmath115 corresponds to an open universe which will expand forever , @xmath116 is the critical or flat universe which will asymptotically expand to infinity while @xmath117 corresponds to a closed universe which will eventually recollapse .",
    "dynamical measurements of the present energy density in _ all _ gravitating matter require ( see peebles 1993 , dekel 1994 ) @xmath118 although such techniques are insensitive to matter which is not clustered on the largest scales probed ( for example relativistic particles ) .",
    "the present energy density of visible radiation alone is better known , since it is dominated by that of the blackbody cmb with present temperature ( mather 1994 ) @xmath119 hence , defining @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 a primordial background of ( three ) massless neutrinos is also believed to be present ( see ) ; this raises the total energy density in relativistic particles to @xmath123 since this is a negligible fraction of the total energy density @xmath124 , the universe is assumed to be matter dominated ( md ) today by non - relativistic particles , i.e. @xmath125 in f - l - r - w models this has actually been true for most of the age of the universe , thus a lower bound to the age of the universe implies an upper bound on its matter content ( see weinberg 1972 ) . conservatively taking @xmath126 and @xmath127 requires ( see kolb and turner 1990 ) @xmath128 however as @xmath17 decreases , @xmath129 rises faster than @xmath130 so that the universe would have been radiation dominated ( rd ) by relativistic particles for @xmath131 assuming that the expansion is adiabatic , the scale - factor is related to the blackbody photon temperature @xmath132 as @xmath133 ( see ) . hence ` radiation ' overwhelmed ` matter ' for @xmath134 cosmological processes of interest to particle physics therefore occured during the rd era , with which we will be mainly concerned in subsequent sections .",
    "as the temperature rises , all particles are expected to ultimately achieve thermodynamic equilibrium through rapid interactions , facilitated by the increasing density .",
    "the interaction rate @xmath135 typically rises much faster with temperature than the expansion rate @xmath55 , hence the epoch at which @xmath135 equals @xmath55 is usually taken to mark the onset of equilibrium ( see wagoner 1980 ) .",
    "more precisely , kinetic equilibrium is established by sufficiently rapid elastic scattering processes , and chemical equilibrium by processes which can create and destroy particles .",
    "fortunately the particle densities do not usually become high enough for many - body interactions to be important and the interaction strengths remain in the perturbative domain , particularly because of asymptotic freedom for the strong interactions . hence the approximation of an ideal gas ( see landau and lifshitz 1982 ) is usually a good one , except near phase transitions .",
    "this vastly simplifies the thermodynamics of the radiation - dominated ( rd ) era .",
    "matters become complicated at temperatures much higher than the masses of the particles involved , since the cross - section for @xmath136 processes ultimately decreases @xmath137 on dimensional grounds , hence @xmath138 ) then falls behind @xmath139 at some critical temperature ( ellis and steigman 1979 ) . moreover , at temperatures approaching the planck scale , the shrinking causal horizon imposes a lower cutoff on the energies of particles ( ellis and steigman 1979 ) , while the number of particles in any locally flat region of space - time becomes negligible ( padmanabhan and vasanti 1982 ) .",
    "enqvist and eskola ( 1990 ) have performed a computer simulation to study the relaxation of a weakly interacting relativistic gas with an initially non - thermal momentum distribution towards thermal equilibrium in the early universe .",

    "these corrections generate a small mass , @xmath300 ( for a light top quark ) ; the critical temperature is then @xmath301 and the phase transition is strongly first - order , generating a large and probably unacceptable amount of entropy ( see sher 1989 )",
    ". however the coleman - weinberg theory is untenable if the top quark mass exceeds @xmath302 as is now established by its recent detection at _ fermilab _ with @xmath303 and , further , such a light higgs is now ruled out by which sets the bound @xmath304 ( particle data group 1996 ) .",
    "recently , cosmological electroweak symmetry breaking has come under renewed scrutiny following the realization that fermion - number violating transitions are unsuppressed at this epoch ; the possibility of generating the baryon asymmetry of the universe then arises if the neccessary non - equilibrium conditions can be achieved via a first - order phase transition ( see cohen 1994 , rubakov and shaposhnikov 1996 ) . while this topic is outside the scope of the present review , we note that according to the detailed studies ( see romo and freire 1994 , yaffe 1995 ) , the phase transition is at best _ very _ weakly first - order .",
    "hence our assumption that any generation of entropy is insignificant is probably justified although in extensions of the sm where the higgs sector is enlarged , e.g. in supersymmetric models , the phase transition may well be strongly first - order with substantial entropy generation ( e.g. brignole 1994 ) . these conclusions are however based on perturbation theory .",
    "recent non - perturbative studies of the @xmath305 higgs model in three dimensions , using both analytic techniques ( e.g. buchmller and philipsen 1995 ) and lattice simulations ( e.g. kajantie 1996 ) show that for large higgs mass there will be no phase transition but rather a ` cross - over ' since there is no gauge - invariant order parameter .",
    "recent lattice calculations ( e.g. boyd 1995 , philipsen 1996 ) also indicate the presence of bound states in the plasma at high temperatures due to the non - abelian nature of the colour and electroweak forces ; however the consequent departure from ideal gas behaviour is only of @xmath306 .    at even higher temperatures ,",
    "@xmath215 will depend on the adopted theory .",
    "for example , in the minimal @xmath307 gut , with three families of fermions and a single ( complex ) * 5 * of higgs plus a * 24 * adjoint of higgs to break @xmath307 , the number of degrees of freedom above the unification scale is given by : @xmath308 in a supersymmetric model below the susy - breaking scale , the degrees of freedom would at least double overall ; in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with three families of fermions and two ( complex ) doublets of higgs plus all the superpartners , @xmath309 when all particles are relativistic . the present experimental limits ( particle data group 1996 ) allow some supersymmetric particles , if they exist , to be light enough to possibly affect the last few entries in",
    "of course given the mass spectrum of any specific supersymmetric ( or other ) model , can be recalculated accordingly .    to summarize , although the formulation of kinetic theory in the expanding universe is far from trivial ( see bernstein 1988 ) , the thermal history of the universe can be reconstructed fairly reliably back to the fermi scale , and , with some caveats , nearly upto the gut scale .",
    "this is possible primarily because we are dealing with a dilute radiation dominated plasma in which non - relativistic particles have negligible abundances and are forced to remain in equilibrium with the relativistic particles",
    ". interaction rates typically rise faster with temperature than the expansion rate of the universe , justifying the usual assumption of equilibrium .",
    "the major uncertainties arise where the ideal gas approximation breaks down , viz . at phase transitions associated with symmetry breaking , and at very high temperatures when",
    "equilibrium may not be achieved .",
    "we now turn to the creation of the light elements towards the end of the `` first three minutes '' which provides the deepest detailed probe    of the big bang .",
    "the physical processes involved have been well understood for some time ( hayashi 1950 , alpher 1953 , hoyle and tayler 1964 , peebles 1966a , b , wagoner 1967 )   and the final abundances of the synthesized elements are sensitive to a variety of parameters and physical constants .",
    "this enables many interesting constraints to be derived on the properties of relic particles or new physics which may influence bbn and alter the synthesized abundances .",
    "it must , of course , first be demonstrated that the expected elemental abundances in the standard bbn model are consistent with observations . there is a complication here in that the light elements are also created and destroyed in astrophysical environments so their abundances today differ significantly from their primordial values .",
    "the latter can only be inferred after correcting for the complex effects of galactic chemical evolution ( see tinsley 1980 ) over several thousand million years and this necessarily introduces uncertainties in the comparison with theory .",
    "there are many excellent reviews of both theoretical and observational aspects of bbn ( see peebles 1971 , weinberg 1972 , schramm and wagoner 1977 , boesgaard and steigman 1985 , pagel 1992 , reeves 1994 ) .",
    "however these usually quote results obtained by numerical means , while in order to appreciate the reliability ( or otherwise ! ) of constraints derived therein one first requires a good analytic understanding of the physical processes involved . secondly , as noted above , the observed elemental abundances have to be corrected for evolutionary effects and there are differences in the approaches taken by different authors in inferring the primordial values .",
    "it is therefore helpful to review the essential theory and the actual observational data before we examine the validity of the standard bbn model and then proceed to discuss the constraints imposed on new physics .",
    "it is convenient to consider element synthesis in the early universe as occuring in two distinct stages : first the decoupling of the weak interactions which keep neutrons and protons in equilibrium , and second the onset , a little later , of the nuclear reactions which build up the light nuclei .",
    "it is possible to do this because the very high value of the entropy per nucleon ( @xmath310 ) ensures that the equilibrium abundances of all bound nuclei are quite negligible as long as free nucleons are in equilibrium .",
    "we begin by outlining an elegant semi - analytic analysis of the first stage by bernstein ( 1989 ) which follows the evolution of the neutron - to - proton ratio and allows the yield of @xmath311 , the primary product of bbn , to be calculated quite accurately _ without _ any detailed analysis of the nuclear reaction network .",
    "the latter is however neccessary to calculate the yields of less stable nuclei such as @xmath312 , @xmath313 and @xmath314 , which are the ` left over ' products of nuclear burning .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath311 abundance depends sensitively on the hubble expansion rate at this epoch ( and therefore on the number of neutrino flavours ) as well as on the neutron lifetime ( which determines the rate of weak interactions ) , but only weakly on the nucleon density .",
    "conversely , the abundances of the other light elements provide a sensitive probe of the nucleon density .      at sufficiently high temperatures ( above a few mev , as we shall see shortly ) neutrons and protons",
    "are maintained in both kinetic equilibrium , i.e. @xmath315 and chemical equilibrium , i.e. @xmath316 through the weak processes @xmath317 defining @xmath318 as the summed rate of the reactions which convert neutrons to protons , @xmath319 the rate @xmath320 for the reverse reactions which convert protons to neutrons is given by detailed balance : @xmath321 for the moment , we ignore the possibility of a large chemical potential in electron neutrinos which would otherwise appear in the exponent above ( see ) .",

    "as mentioned earlier , the comparison of the predicted elemental abundances with observational data is complicated by the fact that the primordial abundances may have been significantly altered during the lifetime of the universe by nuclear processing in stars .",
    "moreover this happens differently for different elements , for example @xmath311 , a very stable nucleus , grows in abundance with time as it is synthesized in stars , while @xmath312 , which is very weakly bound , is always destroyed in stars .",

    "pagel ( 1982 , 1987 , 1992 ) and boesgaard and steigman ( 1985 ) have comprehensively reviewed the observational data and discussed how the primordial abundances may be inferred by allowing for the effects of stellar evolution and galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the interested reader is urged to refer to the original literature cited therein to appreciate the uncertainties involved , both in the measurement of cosmic abundances today and in the bold astrophysical modelling necessary to deduce their values over @xmath542 ago ( @xmath543yr ) .",
    "subsequently there have been several observational developments , some of which have been discussed by pagel ( 1993 ) .",
    "we review the key results which may be used to confront the standard bbn model .",
    "the most important primordially synthesized element , @xmath311 , has been detected , mostly through its optical line emission , in a variety of astrophysical environments , e.g. planetary atmospheres , young stars , planetary nebulae and emission nebulae  galactic as well as extragalactic ( see shaver 1983 ) , as well as in the intergalactic medium at a redhift of @xmath544 ( jakobsen 1994 ) .",
    "hence there is no doubt about the existence of an `` universal '' helium abundance of @xmath545 by mass .",
    "however , helium is also manufactured in stars , hence to determine its primordial abundance we must allow for the stellar helium component through its correlation with some other element , such as nitrogen or oxygen , which is made only in stars ( peimbert and torres - peimbert 1974 ) . this is best done by studying recombination lines from hii regions in blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) where relatively little stellar activity has occured , as evidenced by their low ` metal ' abundance .",
    "( this refers , in astronomical jargon , to any element heavier than helium ! )    in ( a ) we show a correlation plot of the observed helium abundance against that of oxygen and nitrogen as measured in 33 such selected objects ( pagel 1992 ) .",

    "the recent work by pagel ( 1992 ) has specifically addressed several such sources of error ; for example attention is restricted to objects where the ionizing stars are so hot that the correction for neutral helium is negligible .",
    "hence these authors believe that the systematic error has now been reduced to about the same level as the statistical error , i.e. @xmath550 since the ( uncertain ) systematic error is correlated between the different data points rather than being random , we can not assign a formal confidence level to a departure from the mean value .",
    "it is common practice nonetheless to simply add the errors in quadrature .",
    "another method is to add the systematic error to the adopted result and then deduce a @xmath501 bound from the statistical error , assuming a gaussian distribution ( pagel 1992 ) ; this gives the bounds @xmath551 mathews ( 1993 ) have suggested that galactic chemical evolution causes the correlation between helium and nitrogen to be non - linear at low metallicity , consequently the extrapolated helium abundance at zero metallicity is subject to an upward bias .",

    "underlying stellar absorption at @xmath557 ( pagel 1993 ) ; however it is important that such objects be investigated further . in fact",
    "skillman and kennicutt ( 1993 ) have recently obtained @xmath558 in _ izw18 _ , the most metal - poor galaxy known , in agreement with the primordial value derived by pagel ( 1992 ) .",

    ". a combined fit to these data together with that of pagel gives @xmath559 after some `` discrepant '' objects are excluded ( olive and steigman 1995a ) .",
    "an important question is whether the above analyses have failed to identify any other systematic errors in the extraction of @xmath510 .",
    "for example , all the observers cited above use the helium emissivities given by brocklehurst ( 1972 ) .",
    "skillman and kennicutt ( 1993 ) note that use of the emissivities of smits ( 1991 ) would raise the derived value in _",

    "sasselov and goldwirth ( 1994 ) have emphasized that use of the smits ( 1996 ) emissivities gives a better fit to detailed line ratios than the brocklehurst ( 1972 ) emissivities which are known to have problems with the fluxes of the triplet hei lines used to extract @xmath510 .",
    "these authors argue that consideration of additional systematic effects such as inadequacies in the ( ` case b ' ) radiative transfer model used and correction for neutral helium may raise the upper bound on @xmath510 to 0.255 for the data set analysed by olive and steigman 1995a ) , and as high as 0.258 for the measurements of _ izw18 _ by skillman and kennicutt ( 1993 ) .",
    "this question was examined in a study of 10 additional low metallicity bcgs by izotov ( 1994 ) . whereas use of the emissivities of brocklehurst ( 1972 ) yields @xmath560 in excellent agreement with previous results ( e.g. pagel 1992 ) , use of the smits ( 1996 ) emissivities",
    "raises the value to @xmath561 .",

    "@xmath562 it is seen from ( b ) that use of the new emissivities ( together with the new correction factors ( kingdon and ferland 1995 ) for the collisional enhancement of hei emission lines ) also decreases the dispersion of the data points in the regression plots and the derived slope , @xmath563 , is now smaller than found before ( e.g. by pagel 1992 ) and in agreement with general expectations in chemical evolution models .",
    "systematic effects due to deviations from case b recombination theory , temperature fluctuations , wolf - rayet stellar winds and supernova shock waves are demonstrated to be negligible while different corrections for underlying stellar absorption and fluorescent enhancement in the hei lines alter @xmath510 by at most @xmath564 .",

    "however since the lyman-@xmath576 line ( of hydrogen ) is severely saturated even towards such a nearby star , such observations , although very accurate , can not test whether there are real spatial variations in the interstellar deuterium abundance ( pagel 1993 ) .",

    "lower _ bound to the primordial abundance .",
    "mccullough s ( 1992 ) analysis of the observations discussed above then implies : @xmath577 which we consider a `` reliable '' bound ( kernan and sarkar 1996 ) .    to obtain an upper bound to the primordial abundance",

    "tytler and burles ( 1996 ) point out in response that the line of sight through the qas is @xmath603kpc long so it would be difficult for metals to be removed from two independent lines of sight , leaving the same @xmath312 abundance in each .",

    "olive ( 1990 ) obtained a similar bound in the ` instantaneous recycling ' approximation , i.e. assuming that some fraction of gas undergoes several cycles of stellar processing instantaneously .",
    "steigman and tosi ( 1992 , 1995 ) obtain even stronger bounds in more elaborate models of galactic chemical evolution , for particular choices of the initial mass function , star formation rate , matter infall rate . combining these results with the solar system abundances discussed above ,",

    "geiss ( 1993 ) has recently reassessed the solar system data and quotes more generous errors in the derived abundances : @xmath630 if we use these numbers to estimate `` @xmath497 '' limits , the bound is immediately relaxed by a factor of 2 ! in fact it is not even clear if the solar system abundances provide a representative measure at all , given that observations of @xmath313 elsewhere in the galaxy reveal large ( and unexplained ) source - to - source variations ( balser 1994 ) .",
    "further , the survival fraction of @xmath313 may have been overestimated ( hogan 1995b ) .",

    "this is not unexpected since @xmath314 , like @xmath312 , is easily destroyed ( above @xmath639 ) hence only the lithium on the stellar surface survives , to an extent dependent on the amount of mixing with the stellar interior , which in turn depends on the stellar temperature , rotation . for popi stars in open clusters with ages in the range @xmath640 ,",

    "indeed evolutionary modelling ( ignoring rotation ) of halo stars indicate that they are essentially undepleted in lithium ( deliyannis 1990 ) .",
    "taking both observational errors and theoretical uncertainties ( mostly the effects of diffusion ) into account , these authors find the fitted initial abundance to be : @xmath648 this is assumed to be the primordial abundance by walker ( 1991 ) and smith ( 1993 ) since any production of lithium after the big bang , but before halo star formation is presumed to be unlikely ( see boesgaard and steigman 1985 ) .",
    "kernan and krauss ( 1994 ) also adopt this value .",
    "recently the situation has taken a new turn with the discovery that there are several extremely metal - poor popii halo dwarfs with _ no _ detectable lithium .",
    "thorburn ( 1994 ) has determined accurate abundances for 80 stars with [ fe / h]@xmath649 and @xmath650 , of which 3 are lithium deficient with respect to the others by a factor of over 10 ( see ) . ignoring these reveals a weak , though statistically significant , trend of increasing @xmath314 abundance with both increasing temperature and increasing metallicity which had not been apparent in older data ( cf .",
    "olive and schramm 1992 ) but is also seen for a smaller sample of extreme halo dwarfs by norris ( 1994 ) .",
    "thorburn ( 1994 ) interprets this as indicating lithium production by galactic cosmic ray spallation processes .",
    "indeed beryllium ( gilmore 1992 ) and boron ( duncan 1992 ) have also been seen in several metal - poor halo stars with abundances _ proportional _ to the metallicity and in the ratio b / be@xmath651 , which does point at such a production mechanism rather than a primordial origin .",
    "this should also have created lithium at the level of about @xmath652 of its popii abundance ; much of the observed dispersion about the popii ` plateau ' would then be due to the @xmath653gyr range in age of these stars .",
    "thorburn ( 1994 ) therefore identifies the primordial abundance with the observed average value in the hottest , most metal - poor stars , viz .",
    "@xmath654 which agrees very well with the value inferred by deliyannis ( 1990 ) .",
    "subsequently , thorburn s results have been questioned by molaro ( 1995 ) who find _ no _ significant correlation of the lithium abundance , in a sample of 24 halo dwarfs , with either the temperature ( when this is determined by a spectroscopic method rather than by broad - band photometry ) or the metallicity ( determined using an updated stellar atmosphere model ) .",
    "thus they reaffirm the purely primordial origin of the popii @xmath314 ` plateau ' and argue that the observed dispersion is entirely due to measurement errors alone .",
    "however , ryan ( 1996 ) , who include data on 7 new halo dwarfs , have confirmed the original finding of thorburn ( 1994 ) ; they note that molaro ( 1995 ) did not test whether @xmath314 is _ simultaneously _ correlated with @xmath34 and [ fe / h ] . in any case , the abundance molaro ( 1995 ) derive for 24 stars with @xmath655 and [ fe / h]@xmath656 is fortuitously identical to that given by thorburn ( 1994 ) so remains the best estimate of the primordial popii @xmath314 abundance .",
    "even so this leaves open the question of why several stars which are in all respects similar to the other stars which define the popii ` plateau ' , are so lithium deficient .",
    "until this is clarified , it may be premature to assert that the popii abundance of lithium reflects its primordial value .",
    "further , the observation that @xmath641 in popi stars as old as @xmath657 ( in _ ngc188 _ ) then requires the galactic @xmath658 ratio to rise by a factor of about 10 in the first @xmath659 and then remain constant for nearly @xmath542 ( hobbs and pilchaowski 1988 ) .",
    "this encourages the _ opposite _ point of view , viz . that the ( highest ) popi abundance is that of primordially synthesized lithium , which has been ( even more ) depleted in the older popii stars , for example through turbulent mixing driven by stellar rotation ( vauclair 1988 ) .",
    "the observational evidence for a @xmath660 dispersion in the popii @xmath314 ` plateau ' is consistent with this hypothesis ( deliyannis 1993 ) .",

    "vauclair and charbonnel ( 1995 ) have pointed out that a mass loss of order @xmath668 through stellar winds can deplete @xmath314 without depleting @xmath669 ; their preferred primordial abundance would then be the upper envelope of the popii value i.e. @xmath670 .",

    "the above procedure of deriving limits on @xmath417 using one element at a time ignores the fact that the different elemental yields are correlated .",

    "the @xmath312 abundance is strongly anti - correlated with the @xmath311 abundance ; hence those monte carlo runs in which the predicted @xmath311 is lower than the mean , and which therefore may be allowed by some adopted observational upper bound , will also generally predict a higher than average @xmath312 abundance , which may be in conflict with the corresponding observational upper bound . krauss and kernan ( 1995 ) determine the number of runs ( as @xmath417 is varied ) which result in abundances simultaneously satisfying the upper bounds on @xmath311 , @xmath314 and @xmath554 and the lower bound on @xmath312 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath417 is then found by requiring that 50 runs out of 1000 ( upto @xmath692 statistical fluctuations ) satisfy all the constraints . using their method and adopting the ism bound @xmath693 and the popii bound @xmath694 , kernan and sarkar ( 1996 ) find that the maximum allowed value of @xmath417 varies linearly with the adopted upper bound to the @xmath311 as @xmath695 \\times 10^{-10}\\ , \\ ] ] upto @xmath696 ; for higher @xmath510 , the popii @xmath314 bound does not permit @xmath417 to exceed @xmath697 , as shown in ( a ) . if we choose instead to use the more conservative popi bound @xmath698 , the constraint is further relaxed to @xmath699 \\times 10^{-10}\\ , \\ ] ] for @xmath700 and saturates at @xmath701 for higher values , essentially due to the ism @xmath312 bound , as shown in ( b ) .",

    "the above bounds on @xmath417 were obtained assuming the validity of standard bbn amd may be altered in variant models as reviewed by malaney and mathews ( 1993 ) .",
    "below , we briefly discuss deviations which are permitted within the context of the standard model of particle physics  .",
    "then the universe may indeed have the critical density in nucleons without violating the upper bound on the nucleon - to - photon ratio from bbn ! ] since we will discuss the effect of new physics , in .",
    "we will also not consider the effect of gross departures from the standard cosmology , e.g. alternate theories of gravity and anisotropic world - models .",
    "in general , such deviations tend to speed up the expansion rate and increase the synthesized helium abundance , thus further tightening the constraints derived from standard bbn .      the most well motivated departure from standard bbn is the possibility that nucleosynthesis occurs in an inhomogeneous medium , e.g. due to fluctuations generated by a first - order quark - hadron phase transition at @xmath704 , a possibility emphasized by witten ( 1984 ) .",
    "as noted earlier ( see footnote just before ) the signature for this would be the synthesis of significant amounts of elements beyond helium , although there is continuing controversy about the extent to which this would happen , due to the difficulty of adequately modelling the problem ( e.g. applegate 1988 , malaney and fowler 1988 , terasawa and sato 1991 , jedamzik 1994b ) .",
    "observationally , there are no indications for an universal ` floor ' in the abundances of such elements , particularly beryllium and boron , which would suggest a primordial origin ( see pagel 1993 ) and indeed their abundances are reasonably well understoood in terms of cosmic ray spallation processes ( e.g. prantzos 1993 , steigman 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , recent theoretical developments suggest that the quark - hadron phase transition is effectively second - order ( see bonometto and pantano 1993 ) and does not generate significant fluctuations in the nucleon distribution ( e.g. banerjee and gavai 1992 ) .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to study the effect of hypothetical fluctuations on nucleosynthesis to see to what extent the standard picture may be altered .",
    "such models ( e.g. kurki - suonio 1990 , mathews 1990b , jedamzik 1994a ) can satisfy the conservative observational bounds on @xmath311 , @xmath312 and @xmath314 ( popi ) with a higher nucleon density than in standard bbn ; the upper limit to @xmath417 is raised to @xmath705 however the less reliable bound on @xmath314 ( popii ) and the indirect bound on @xmath706 _ are _ violated unless @xmath417 remains in about the same range as is required by homogeneous nucleosynthesis on the basis of the same bounds . thus even allowing for hypothetical and rather fine - tuned inhomogeneities , an einstein - desitter universe with @xmath707 is disfavoured .",
    "although a nucleon - dominated universe which is open , e.g. having @xmath708 , is still allowed if one invokes inhomogeneous nucleosynthesis , there is no clear test of such a scenario .",
    "in particular the expected yields of ` r'-process elements ( heavier than si ) is over a factor of @xmath106 below presently observable bounds ( rauscher 1994 ) .      in models with evaporating primordial black holes ( carlson 1990 ) ( as also relic massive decaying particles ( dimopoulos 1988 ) )",
    ", the nucleon density can be much higher with @xmath709 , since the photon and hadronic cascades triggered by the decay products ( see ) can reprocess the excess @xmath311 and @xmath314 and create acceptable amounts of @xmath312 and @xmath313 for decay lifetimes in the range @xmath710 . which can convert protons into neutrons at late times .",
    "thus enough @xmath312 can be created ( and not burnt further due to the low prevailing densities ) while @xmath463 ( which would have subsequently decayed to overproduce @xmath314 ) is destroyed ( scherrer 1984 , terasawa and sato 1987 ) .",
    "however the increased expansion rate due to the decaying particle also boosts the neutron fraction at freeze - out , hence the final @xmath311 abundance . to allow @xmath711 subject to the constraint @xmath712 requires rather fine - tuned parameters e.g. a tau neutrino with @xmath713 , @xmath714 and @xmath715 ( gyuk and turner 1994 ) . of course this possibility does not exist within the standard model and appears contrived even in extensions thereof since the decays must not create any visible energy ( see ) . ]",
    "the abundance of each element is determined by the fixed point of the balance equation incorporating its production by hadronic showers and destruction by photodissociation .",
    "the final @xmath311 abundance depends only on the product of the decaying particle abundance and baryonic branching ratio , while the other abundances are determined by the ratio of the particle mass to the baryonic branching ratio .",
    "the final abundance of @xmath314 can be made consistent with either the popi or popii value but a large amount of @xmath663 is also produced with @xmath716 , in apparent conflict with the observed bound of @xmath717 in popii stars .",
    "dimopoulos ( 1988 ) have argued that since @xmath663 is much more fragile than @xmath314 , it may have been adequately depleted through rotational mixing ( see deliyannis 1990 ) .",
    "indeed @xmath663 has been recently detected in two popii stars with an abundance consistent with a primordial source , although admittedly there are difficulties in reconciling such a scenario with our present understanding of galactic chemical evolution ( e.g. audouze and silk 1989 , steigman 1993 ) .",
    "the more modest aim of having a purely nucleonic universe with @xmath708 can be achieved without ( over)producing @xmath663 in the scenario of gnedin and ostriker ( 1992 ) wherein an early generation of massive stars collapse to form black holes with accretion disks which emit high energy photons capable of photodissociating the overproduced helium and lithium .",
    "these authors confirm , as was noted earlier by dimopoulos ( 1988 ) , that reprocessing by photodisintegration alone can not allow values higher than @xmath718 , contrary to the results of audouze ( 1985 ) .",
    "finally we consider the possible role of neutrino degeneracy , which was first studied by wagoner ( 1967 ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier a chemical potential in electron neutrinos can alter neutron - proton equilibrium , as well as increase the expansion rate , the latter effect being less important .",
    "consequently only the abundance of @xmath311 is significantly affected and the allowed range of @xmath417 is still determined by the adopted primordial abundances of the other elements .",
    "for example , imposing @xmath719 then requires ( e.g. yahil and beaudet 1976 , david and reeves 1980 , scherrer 1983 , terasawa and sato 1988 , kang and steigman 1992 ) @xmath720 assuming the chemical potential in other neutrino types , which can only increase the expansion rate , to be negligible .",
    "( for orientation , a value of @xmath721 is equivalent to adding an additional neutrino flavour ( with @xmath722 ) which we consider in . ) now , if both @xmath447 and @xmath723 are non - zero , then the lowering of the @xmath724 ratio at freeze - out ( due to @xmath447 ) may be compensated for by the net speed - up of the expansion rate ( due to @xmath725 ) , thus enabling the @xmath311 and the @xmath726 abundances to be all within observational bounds even for large values of the nucleon density which are normally disallowed ( yahil and beaudet 1976 ) .",
    "even the surviving @xmath314 abundance , which is determined by a more complex interplay between reactions with different @xmath417 dependence , may be made to match either its popi value ( david and reeves 1980 ) or its popii value ( olive 1991 , starkman 1992 , kang and steigman 1992 ) .",
    "for example , with @xmath727 _ and _ @xmath728 , one can have @xmath729 as high as @xmath730 ( e.g. starkman 1992 ) .",
    "however such an universe would have been radiation dominated until well after the ( re)combination epoch , making it difficult to create the observed large - scale structure ( freese 1983 ) . taking such constraints into account , kang and steigman ( 1992 ) quote the limits @xmath731 i.e. a critical density nucleonic universe is not permitted . in any case , earlier theoretical studies which allowed the possibility of generating such large lepton numbers ( e.g. langacker 1982 ) need to be reconsidered since we now know that ( @xmath732 conserving ) fermion number violation is unsuppressed even in the standard model at temperatures above the electroweak phase transition ( see shaposhnikov 1991 , 1992 ) .",
    "this would have converted part of any primordial lepton asymmetry into a baryon asymmetry , hence one can not plausibly have @xmath733 without considerable fine - tuning ( e.g. arranging for large cancellations between lepton asymmetries of opposite signs in different flavour channels ) . therefore unless the lepton asymmetry is somehow generated _",
    "after _ the electroweak phase transition , or unless the asymmetry is so large as to prevent the phase transition itself ( see linde 1979 ) , it is reasonable to conclude that neutrino degeneracy can not significantly affect the standard bbn model .",
    "having established the consistency of standard bbn , we will now use it to constrain new physics beyond the standard @xmath2 model .",
    "this has usually been done for specific models but one can identify two general classes of constraints , viz .",
    "those pertaining to stable particles ( e.g. new massless neutrinos , goldstone bosons ) which are relativistic during nucleosynthesis , and those concerned with massive , decaying particles ( e.g. massive neutrinos , gravitinos ) which are non - relativistic at this time .",
    "the extent to which we need to be cautious in this enterprise depends on the sensitivity of the physics under consideration to the light element abundances .",
    "for example , in constraining massive decaying particles ( ) , we can use together `` reliable '' as well as `` indirect '' bounds on elemental abundances , because the constraints can be simply scaled for different choices of the bounds .",
    "however in constraining the number of neutrino species or other light stable particles we must be more careful since the result is sensitive to the lower limit to @xmath417 following from the abundance bounds on elements other than @xmath311 and can not be simply scaled for different choices of such bounds .",

    "these authors presented a systematic analysis of how the inferred constraint on @xmath272 varies with the assumed nucleon density , neutron lifetime and @xmath311 abundance and emphasized the need for a detailed investigation of the other elemental abundances to better constrain @xmath417 and @xmath272 .",
    "this was done by yang ( 1984 ) who proposed that the sum of primordial @xmath312 and @xmath313 could be bounded by considerations of galactic chemical evolution ; using solar system data they inferred @xmath767_{\\pr}\\leqsim10^{-4}$ ] and from this concluded @xmath768 ( see ) .",

    "just as in the case of the derived limits on @xmath417 ( see discussion before ) , a correct analysis allowing for correlations would yield a tighter constraint on @xmath272 .",
    "kernan and krauss ( 1994 ) illustrate this by considering the abundance bounds @xmath767_{\\pr}\\leq10^{-4}$ ] and @xmath681 advocated by walker ( 1991 ) and determining the @xmath501 limits on @xmath417 and @xmath272 by requiring that at least 50 out of 1000 monte carlo runs lie within the _ joint _ range bounded by both @xmath554 and @xmath311 .",
    "as shown in ( a ) , this imposes tighter constraints than simply requiring that 50 runs lie , either to the left of the @xmath783 bound ( for low @xmath417 ) , or below the @xmath311 bound ( for high @xmath417 ) .",

    "for example even a singlet neutrino which decouples above @xmath785 will be equivalent to 0.047 extra neutrino species , and is therefore _ excluded_.",
    "more crucially , the helium mass fraction ( for @xmath272=3 ) is now required to exceed @xmath786 for consistency with the assumed bound on @xmath554 , so a measurement below this value would rule out standard bbn altogether ! hence these authors draw attention again to the possibility that the systematic uncertainty in the usually quoted value of @xmath442 has been underestimated .",
    "the @xmath272 limit can be simply parametrized as @xmath787 where @xmath788 has been used ( krauss and kernan 1995 ) , so @xmath789 for @xmath702 .",
    "olive and steigman ( 1995b ) assign a low systematic error of @xmath790 to their extrapolated primordial helium abundance @xmath791 and thus obtain a best fit value of @xmath792 .",
    "this is unphysical if there are indeed at least 3 massless neutrinos so they compute the upper limit on @xmath272 restricting attention to the _ physical _ region alone ( see particle data group 1996 ) , obtaining @xmath793 they also impose the weaker condition @xmath794 ( as would be appropriate if the @xmath795 was massive and decayed before nucleosynthesis ) to obtain the bound @xmath796 .",
    "as we have discussed earlier , the indirect bound @xmath772_{\\pr}\\leq10^{-4}$ ] used above is rather suspect and it would be more conservative to use the `` reasonable '' observational bounds @xmath797 and @xmath798 to constrain @xmath417 . a monte carlo exercise has been carried out for this case ( kernan and sarkar 1996 ) and yields the constraint , @xmath799 if we require all constraints to be _ simultaneously _ satisfied . thus , as shown in ( b ) , the conservative limit is @xmath800 , if the @xmath311 mass fraction is as high as @xmath616 .",
    "equivalently , we can derive a limit on the ` speedup rate ' of the hubble expansion due to the presence of the additional neutrinos which contribute 7/4 each to @xmath242 , the number of relativistic degrees of freedom , increasing it above its canonical value of 43/4 at this epoch .",

    "we consider the bounds given in and to be conservative and advocate their use by particle physicists seeking to constrain models of new physics .",
    "the presence during nucleosynthesis of a _ non - relativistic _ particle , e.g. a massive neutrino , would also increase the energy density , hence the rate of expansion , and thus increase the synthesized abundances .",
    "this effect is however different from that due to the addition of a new relativistic particle , since the energy density of a non - relativistic particle decreases @xmath812 ( rather than @xmath813 ) hence the speed - up rate due to the non - relativistic particle is not constant but increases steadily with time .",
    "if the particle thus comes to matter - dominate the universe much earlier than the canonical epoch , then it must subsequently decay ( dominantly ) into relativistic particles so that its energy density can be adequately redshifted , otherwise the bounds on the age and expansion rate of the universe today would be violated ( sato and kobayashi 1977 , dicus 1978a ) .",
    "if such decays are into _ interacting _ particles such as photons or electromagnetically / strongly interacting particles which increase the entropy , the nucleon - to - photon ratio will decrease ( miyama and sato 1978 , dicus 1978b ) .",

    "first we must calculate how the dynamics of the expansion are altered from the usual radiation - dominated case .",
    "given the thermally - averaged self - annihilation cross - section of the @xmath816 particle , one can obtain the relic abundance in ratio to photons the @xmath816 particle would have at @xmath817 , assuming it is stable , using the methods outlined by srednicki ( 1988 ) and gondolo and gelmini ( 1991 ) .",
    "an approximate estimate may be obtained from the simple ` freeze - out ' approximation ( see kolb and turner 1990 ) of determining the temperature at which the self - annihilation rate falls behind the hubble expansion rate .",
    "the surviving relic abundance is then given by the equilibrium abundance at this temperature : @xmath818 since we will generally be concerned with decay lifetimes much longer than @xmath819 , this can be taken to be the initial value of the decaying particle abundance .",
    "we can now identify the temperature @xmath820 at which the particle energy density @xmath821 ) would equal the radiation energy density @xmath822 , viz .",
    "@xmath823 if the particle decays at a temperature below @xmath820 , then it would have matter - dominated the universe before decaying and thus significantly speeded up the expansion .",

    "following dicus ( 1978a , b ) we assume that the effect of the decays is to cause a ` jump ' in the temperature , which we obtain from energy conservation to be @xmath828^{3/4 } [ t\\,(t < \\tau_{x } ) +     f_{\\gamma } g_{\\rho } t_{\\m}]^{1/4}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath829 is the fraction of @xmath830 which is ultimately converted into photons .",

    "the constraint on the decay lifetime is ( ellis 1985b ) @xmath834 if we take @xmath433 , i.e. for @xmath835 .",
    "as mentioned above , the upper limit to @xmath814 corresponding to the conservative requirement @xmath836 depends on the extent to which the expansion rate during nucleosynthesis is influenced by the massive particle .",
    "such limits were obtained by kolb and scherrer ( 1982 ) ( following dicus 1978b ) who modified the standard bbn code to include a massive neutrino ( with the appropriate energy density ) and examined its effect on the elemental yields .",
    "the effect should be proportional to the neutrino energy density , which rises @xmath837 as long as the neutrinos remain relativistic at decoupling , i.e. for @xmath838 less than a few mev , and falls thereafter @xmath839 ( e.g. lee and weinberg 1977 ) .",
    "indeed the synthesized abundances are seen to increase with increasing neutrino mass upto @xmath840 , and fall thereafter as @xmath838 increases further .",

    "these authors were thus able to study how the constraint weakens as @xmath850 decreases below @xmath851 , as shown by the full line in ( a ) .",

    "equivalent in this context to allowing one new neutrino species ( see ) , then yields the constraint @xmath863 valid for @xmath864 as shown by the dashed line in ( b ) .",
    "this requirement is _ more _ restrictive than the corresponding one for decays which create entropy , hence the two constraints should be weighted with the appropriate branching ratios in order to obtain the correct constraint for a particle whose decays produce both non - interacting particles and photons .",
    "neutrino decay products actually present a special case since these are not entirely non - interacting . indeed",
    "if decaying particles create a ( non - thermal ) population of electron ( anti)neutrinos , these will bias the chemical balance between protons and neutrons towards the latter through the reaction @xmath865 ; the reverse reaction @xmath866 is negligible by comparison since protons always outnumber neutrons by a large factor ( scherrer 1984 ) .",
    "this effect is important only when the mass of the decaying particle is of @xmath867 as will be discussed later in the context of a massive unstable tau neutrino ( see ) .",

    "this requires @xmath869 a particle which saturates this bound would of course be the ( dominant ) constituent of the dark matter ; however from the preceeding discussion it is clear that such an abundance is still too small to have affected nucleosynthesis .",
    "far more stringent constraints than those discussed above come from consideration of the direct effects of the decay products on the synthesized elemental abundances .",
    "high energy photons or leptons from the decaying particles can initiate electromagnetic cascades in the radiation - dominated thermal plasma , thus creating many low energy photons with @xmath870 which are capable of photodissociating the light elements ( lindley 1979 ) .",
    "such photofissions can occur only for @xmath871 , i.e. after nucleosynthesis is _ over _ , since at earlier epochs the blackbody photons are energetic enough and numerous enough that photon - photon interactions are far more probable than photon - nucleus interactions ( lindley 1985 ) .",
    "when the @xmath816 particle decays into energetic quarks or gluons , these fragment into hadronic showers which interact with the ambient nucleons thus changing their relative abundances .",
    "( the alteration of elemental abundances by direct annihilation with antinucleons has also been considered ( e.g khlopov and linde 1984 , ellis 1985b , halm 1987 , dominguez - tenreiro 1987 ) ; however dimopoulos ( 1988 ) have shown that the effect of the hadronic showers is far more important . )",
    "if such hadronic decays occur _ during _ nucleosyntheis , the neutron - to - proton ratio is increased resulting in the production of more @xmath312 and @xmath311 ( reno and seckel 1988 ) .",
    "however when hadronic decays occur _ after _ nucleosynthesis , the result is destruction of @xmath311 and creation of @xmath312 and @xmath313 , as well as both @xmath663 and @xmath314 ( dimopoulos 1988 ) .",
    "when the @xmath816 particle has both radiative and hadronic decay modes , the situation is then simplified by noting that for @xmath872 , radiative decays do not play a significant role while hadronic decays are constrained by the concommitant overproduction of @xmath312 and @xmath311 by the hadronic showers ( reno and seckel 1988 ) . for longer lifetimes , the situation is more complicated since elements may be simultaneously both created and destroyed by photo- and hadro- processes .",
    "it has been argued that for @xmath873 , the most stringent constraint on radiative decays comes from constraining the possible overproduction of @xmath312 and @xmath313 through photofission of @xmath311 , since the simultaneous destruction of the former by photofission is negligible by comparison ( ellis 1985b , juszkiewicz 1985 ) .",
    "a somewhat weaker constraint obtains from constraining the depletion of the @xmath311 abundance itself ( ellis 1985b , dimopoulos 1989 ) .",
    "these constraints are strengthened if hadronic decays also occur since these too destroy @xmath311 and create @xmath312 and @xmath313 .",
    "however all these constraints are found to be modified when the development of the electromagnetic cascades is studied taking @xmath874 ( mller ) scattering into account ; this reveals that @xmath311 destruction is significant only for @xmath875 ( ellis 1992 ) .",
    "it has also been argued that in the interval @xmath876 , @xmath312 is photodissociated but not @xmath311 , so that the strongest constraint on radiative decays now comes from requiring that @xmath312 should not be excessively depleted ( juszkiewicz 1985 , dimopoulos 1989 ) .",
    "again , reexamination of the cascade process indicates that the appropriate interval is shifted to @xmath877 ( ellis 1992 ) .",
    "this particular constraint may appear to be circumvented if hadronic decay channels are also open since hadronic showers _ create _ @xmath312 ; however such showers also create the rare isotopes @xmath663 and @xmath314 and are thus severely constrained by observational limits on their abundance ( dimopoulos 1989 ) .",
    "this ensures that the @xmath312 photofission constraint is not affected by such hadronic decays .",
    "let us begin by examining the manner in which a massive particle decaying into photons or leptons generates electromagnetic cascades in the radiation - dominated thermal plasma of the early universe .",
    "the dominant mode of energy loss of a high energy photon ( of energy @xmath878 ) is @xmath364 pair - production on the low energy blackbody photons ( of energy @xmath879 ) while the produced electrons and positrons ( of energy @xmath880 ) lose energy by inverse - compton scattering the blackbody photons to high energies .",
    "pair - production requires @xmath881 , while @xmath882 implies that scattering occurs in the klein - nishina regime in which the electron loses a large fraction of its energy to the scattered photon .",
    "thus a primary photon or lepton triggers a cascade which develops until the photon energies have fallen below the pair - production threshold , @xmath883 .",
    "subsequently the photons undergo compton scattering on the electrons and pair - production on the ions of the thermal plasma . if the density of the blackbody photons is large enough , the cascade is termed ` saturated ' implying that nearly all of the primary paricle energy is converted into photons with energy below @xmath884 .",
    "note that such an electromagnetic cascade can be initiated even when the decay particle is a neutrino since it can initiate pair - production , @xmath885 , off the ( anti)neutrinos of the thermal background , if its energy is sufficiently high ( e.g. gondolo 1993 ) , or even off the decay ( anti)neutrinos ( frieman and giudice 1989 ) .",
    "once high energy electrons have been thus created , the subsequent development of the shower proceeds as before .",
    "the spectrum of the ` breakout ' photons below the pair - production threshold was originally found by monte carlo simulations of the cascade process to be ( aharonian 1985 , dimopoulos 1988 ) @xmath886 when the background photons are assumed to be monoenergetic .",
    "subsequently an analytic study of the kinetic equation for the cascade process showed that the spectrum actually steepens further to @xmath887 for @xmath888 ( zdziarski and svensson 1989 ) .",
    "this feature had not been recognized in the monte carlo simulations due to insufficient statistics . in the cosmological context ,",
    "the background photons are not monoenergetic but have a planck distribution at temperature @xmath34 .",
    "na\"vely we would expect that the pair - production threshold is then @xmath889 .",
    "however the primval plasma is radiation - dominated , i.e. the number density of photons is very large compared to the number density of electrons and nuclei .",
    "hence even when the temperature is too low for a high energy photon to pair - produce on the _ bulk _ of the blackbody photons , pair - production may nevertheless occur on the energetic photons in the wien tail of the planck distribution ( lindley 1985 ) .",
    "although the spectrum here is falling exponentially with energy , the number of photons with @xmath890 is still comparable to the number of thermal electrons since @xmath891 .",
    "therefore pair - production on such photons is as important as compton scattering on electrons or pair - production on ions , the respective cross - sections being all comparable .",
    "hence the value of @xmath884 is significantly lowered below the above estimate , as seen by equating the mean free paths against pair - production on photons and compton scattering on electrons ( zdziarski and svensson 1989 ) : @xmath892}\\ .\\ ] ] ( note that at the energies relevant to photofission processes ( @xmath893 ) , pair - production on ions is unimportant by comparison with compton scattering . )",
    "although various authors have noted this effect , they have used quite different estimates of @xmath884 , viz .",
    "@xmath894 ( lindley 1985 , juszkiewicz 1985 ) , @xmath895 ( salati 1987 ) , @xmath896 ( kawasaki and sato 1987 ) , @xmath897 ( dimopoulos 1988 , 1989 ) and @xmath898 ( dominguez - tenreiro 1987 ) .",
    "moreover all these authors assumed the spectrum to be of the form whereas for a blackbody target photon distribution it actually steepens to @xmath887 for @xmath899 ( zdziarski 1988 ) .",
    "subsequently it was noted that @xmath874 elastic scattering is the _",
    "dominant _ process in a radiation - dominated plasma for photons just below the pair - production threshold ( zdziarski and svensson 1989 ) , hence @xmath884 really corresponds to the energy for which the mean free paths against @xmath874 scattering and @xmath874 pair - production are equal . for a planck distribution of background photons this is ( ellis 1992 ) @xmath900 photons pair - produce above this energy and scatter elastically below it .",
    "another effect of @xmath874 scattering is reprocessing of the cascade spectrum leading to further reduction in the number of high energy photons .",
    "the spectrum now falls like @xmath901 upto the energy @xmath902 where @xmath874 scattering and compton scattering are equally probable and then steepens to @xmath903 before being cutoff at @xmath884 by the onset of pair - production ( zdziarski 1988 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath902 depends weakly on the photon energy ; at the energies of @xmath904 relevant to the photofission of light nuclei , it is @xmath905 i.e. effectively @xmath906 .",
    "we can now study how the yields in the standard bbn model are altered due to photofission by the cascade photons from a hypothetical decaying particle .",
    "let @xmath907 denote the spectrum of high energy photons ( or electrons ) from massive particle decay , normalized as @xmath908 where @xmath829 is the fraction of the @xmath816 particle mass released in the form of electromagnetically interacting particles ( easily calculable once the decay modes and branching ratios are specified ) .",
    "a decay photon ( or electron ) of energy @xmath909 initiates a cascade with the spectrum @xmath910 where we have normalized the cascade spectrum as @xmath911 recently , kawasaki and moroi ( 1995a , b ) have claimed that numerical solution of the governing boltzman equations yields a different cascade spectrum which has significant power beyond the cutoff @xmath884 and is also less steep below @xmath912 .",
    "we note that protheroe ( 1995 ) obtain results in agreement with those above from a detailed monte carlo simulation of the cascade process .",
    "to write the balance equation for the change in the abundance of element @xmath143 with total photofission cross - section @xmath913 ( above threshold @xmath914 ) , we note that recombination of the dissociated nuclei , in particular @xmath312 , is negligible for @xmath915 , hence ( ellis 1985b ) @xmath916 where @xmath917 is the partial cross - section for photofission of element @xmath143 to element @xmath221 and @xmath918 is the cross - section for compton scattering on the thermal electrons of density @xmath919 for a h+he plasma , taking @xmath920 .",
    "( anticipating the stringent constraints on the particle abundance to be derived shortly , we assume that @xmath417 is not altered significantly by the entropy released in particle decays . )",

    "the integrals @xmath929 and @xmath930 have been computed numerically for various values of @xmath850 using the cascade spectrum and the known cross - sections for photofission processes ( see faul 1981 , gari and hebach 1981 , govaerts 1981 ) .",

    "this reflects the fact that the relevant photofission cross - sections are all of order a few millibarns above threshold and fall rapidly thereafter with increasing energy .",
    "photofission begins when the cascade cutoff energy just crosses the photofission threshold and the dominant effect is that of photons with energies just over this threshold .",

    "are stopped before they interact with the ambient neutrons so that threhold values of cross - sections can be used ( reno and seckel 1988 ) .",

    "( for injection of @xmath1012 pairs , the neutron fraction is actually reduced but this is compensated for by the effects of mesons and @xmath1013 injection . ) the additional neutrons thus produced are all synthesized into @xmath311 and hence hadronic decays in this lifetime interval are constrained by the observational upper bound to the helium abundance .",
    "reno and seckel ( 1988 ) obtain upper limits on @xmath1014 as a function of @xmath850 for @xmath1015 and @xmath1016 , adopting the bound @xmath1017 .",
    "we have rescaled their results ( for the case when @xmath816 does not itself carry baryon number ) to the more stringent constraint @xmath836 ; this requires that we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath1015 since for @xmath1018 , @xmath510 already exceeds 0.25 even in the absence of @xmath816 decays ( see also lazarides 1990 ) .",
    "we calculate the resulting upper limit on @xmath948 taking @xmath1019 ( the limit scales inversely as @xmath995 ) and show this in .",

    "hence in the interval @xmath1025 , the appropriate constraint on hadronic decays is the indirect bound @xmath1026 . the corresponding upper limit on @xmath948 , extracted from reno and seckel ( 1988 ) , is also shown in .",
    "the above arguments apply to _ any _ form of energy release in the early universe , for example to annihilations of massive particles as they turn non - relativistic and freeze - out .",

    "should be imposed on the energy released in such annihilations .",
    "the constraints derived from considerations of entropy generation ( ) and speedup of the expansion rate ( ) apply to any particle which is non - relativistic during nucleosynthesis , i.e. heavier than @xmath1027 , and are independent of the mass ( except insofar as the mass may determine the relic abundance ) .",
    "however the bounds based on the development of electromagnetic ( ) and hadronic ( ) cascades require the mass of the decaying ( or annihilating ) particle to be significantly higher .",
    "for example , to generate an electromagnetic shower capable of efficiently photodissociating @xmath312 , the initiating photon / electron must have an energy exceeding twice the relevant threshold , i.e. about @xmath1028 and this would require the decaying particle to be at least @xmath1029 in mass ; for @xmath311 , the required mass is closer to @xmath1030 . to generate a hadronic cascade ,",
    "the mass would have to be even higher , typically in excess of a few hundred mev .",
    "thus when dealing with a mass of @xmath1031 , e.g. a massive @xmath795 , it is more reliable to just calculate the spectrum of the photons scattered by the decay @xmath267 and then evaluate the extent to which say deuterium is photodissociated ( sarkar and cooper 1984 , scherrer 1984 ) . is high in a radiation - dominated universe , so that @xmath1032 at the epochs of interest .",

    "it was believed ( lindley 1979 , cowsik 1981 ) that the radiative decays of neutrinos heavier than about @xmath1028 can be restricted further by constraining the photofission of deuterium by the decay photons . however kolb and scherrer ( 1982 ) argued that this constraint does not apply to the _ dominant _ decay mode @xmath1098 since the rapid thermalization of the decay @xmath267 by scattering against the background photons severely suppresses @xmath312 photofission .",

    "subsequently the experimental limit on the @xmath394 mass has come down to @xmath1122 while the laboratory limits on the mixing angle @xmath1104 have improved further .",

    "we emphasize that this bound is more general than the similar one which only applies to dirac neutrinos which decay ` invisibly ' after nucleosynthesis .",
    "sarkar and cooper ( 1984 ) had argued that a @xmath394 lighter than @xmath1126 has no decay modes which are fast enough to satisfy the constraint from the energy density .",

    "however , this neccessarily enhances the radiative decay mode as well ( mckellar and pakvasa 1983 , gronau and yahalom 1984 ) and is thus ruled out observationally .",

    "usually involves the spontaneous violation of lepton number , a candidate particle is the associated goldstone boson , the majoron ( chikashige 1980 , gelmini and roncadelli 1981 ) . the neutrino decay lifetime in such models is usually too long ( e.g. schechter and valle 1982 ) but can be made sufficiently short if the model is made contrived enough . although majorons which have couplings to the @xmath148 are now ruled out by , there still remain some viable models with , e.g. singlet majorons ( see gelmini and roulet 1995 ) .",
    "if neutrinos can indeed have fast decays into majorons then the bbn bounds on visible decays discussed above are not relevant .",
    "nevertheless the constraints based on the expansion rate are still valid and additional constraints obtain if the final state includes electron ( anti)neutrinos ( e.g. terasawa and sato 1987 , kawasaki 1994 , dodelson 1994 ) .",
    "interestingly enough , such decays can slightly reduce the @xmath311 abundance for a mass of @xmath1129 and a lifetime of @xmath1130 , thus _ weakening _ the bound on @xmath272 .",
    "neutrino _ flavour _ oscillations are not relevant in the early universe since the number densities of all flavours are equal in thermal equilibrium and all three species decouple at about the same temperature . however",
    "if there is mixing between the left - handed ( active ) and right - handed ( sterile ) neutrinos , then oscillations may bring these into thermal equilibrium boosting the expansion rate while depleting the population of active ( electron ) neutrinos which participate in nuclear reactions .",
    "thus powerful bounds on such mixing can be deduced from consideration of the effects on nucleosynthesis .",
    "these considerations are particularly relevant to reports of experimental anomalies attributed to the existence of sterile neutrinos , e.g. the @xmath1131 anomaly in @xmath435-decay ( hime and jelly 1991 , see hime 1991 ) and the recently reported 33.9mev anomaly in @xmath1110 decay ( armbruster 1995 , see barger 1995 )    the first estimates of these effects ( e.g. khlopov and petcov 1981 , fargion and shepkin 1981 , langacker 1986 , manohar 1987 ) did not take into account the coherent forward scattering of the active species ( ntzold and raffelt 1988 ) which provides a correction to the average momentum ( @xmath1132 ) of @xmath392 in the thermal plasma . for @xmath1133",

    "a dirac magnetic moment allows the inert rh states to be produced in the early universe through @xmath1185 scattering ( morgan 1981a ) with cross - section @xmath1186 fukugita and yazaki ( 1987 ) noted that @xmath1187 whereas @xmath1188 where @xmath1189 is the debye length in the plasma of electron density @xmath1190 . by the arguments of",
    ", the @xmath1191 should go out of equilibrium early enough that its abundance is adequately diluted by subsequent entropy generation .",
    "this requires @xmath1192 according to the approximate calculation of morgan ( 1981a ) . a more careful analysis ( fukugita and yazaki 1987 ) gives @xmath1193 corresponding to the usual constraint @xmath1069 .",
    "( the conservative constraint @xmath1194 would not change this significantly . )",
    "this is more stringent than direct experimental bounds , e.g. @xmath1195 ( derbin 1994 ) and @xmath1196 ( krakauer 1990 ) .",
    "if there is a primordial magnetic field @xmath13 then spin - procession can further populate the rh states ( e.g. shapiro and wasserman 1981 ) , leading to the correlated bound @xmath1197 ( fukugita 1988 ) .",
    "giudice ( 1990 ) pointed out that the bound applies only to neutrinos which are relativistic at nucleosynthesis and can therefore be evaded by the tau neutrino which is experimentally allowed to have a mass upto 24 mev .",
    "indeed whereas such a massive @xmath394 would nominally have too high a relic abundance , a magnetic moment of @xmath1198 would enable it to self - annihilate rather efficiently ( through @xmath266 rather than @xmath148 exchange ) so as to make @xmath1199 today .",
    "there is no conflict with nucleosynthesis since the @xmath394 energy density during bbn can be much less than that of a relativistic neutrino .",
    "in fact kawano ( 1992 ) calculate that if the magnetic moment of a mev mass @xmath394 exceeds @xmath1200 its energy density during bbn is sufficiently reduced that it satisfies @xmath566 ( see also grasso and kolb 1996 ) .",
    "( for a much larger @xmath1201 , the self - annihilation of @xmath394s is so efficient that effectively @xmath1202 rather than 3 , hence the @xmath311 abundance is actually reduced , rather than increased , relative to standard bbn ! )",
    "however the direct experimental bound @xmath1203 rules out the possibility that a mev mass tau neutrino can constitute the dark matter ( cooper - sarkar 1992 ) .",
    "apart from a magnetic moment , neutrinos may have additional interactions in extensions of the standard model and this can be constrained by bbn in a similar manner ( hecht 1971 , morgan 1981b ) .",
    "for example , grifols and mass ( 1987 ) have calculated a bound on the neutrino charge - radius defined through the expression @xmath1204 corresponding to the constraint @xmath1069 .",
    "mass and toldr ( 1994a ) have also considered a hypothetical vector - type interaction _ between _ neutrinos , @xmath1205 , which can bring rh states into equilibrium . requiring as",
    "before that this does not happen below the quark - hadron transition implies the limit @xmath1206 another bbn constraint on non - standard interactions was derived by babu ( 1991 ) .",
    "kolb ( 1986c ) have studied hypothetical ` generic ' interacting species , viz .",
    "particles which maintain good thermal contact with neutrinos ( or photons ) throughout the bbn epoch .",
    "they show that the effect on bbn depends on the particle mass and can not be simply parametrized in terms of @xmath1207 .",
    "an example is a massive neutrino in the triplet - majoron model ( gelmini and roncadelli 1981 ) which maintains equilibrium with light neutrinos through exchange of majorons  the goldstone boson associated with global lepton number violation .",
    "stringent bounds are then imposed on the majoron couplings ; however this model has in any case been experimentally ruled out by .",
    "interactions mediated by new gauge bosons will be considered in the context of extended technicolour ( ) and superstring - motivated models (  [ ss ] ) .",
    "this is an attractive mechanism for spontaneously breaking the electroweak @xmath1042 symmetry _ non - perturbatively _ , without introducing fundamental higgs bosons .",
    "it does so in a manner akin to the breaking of the @xmath1208 chiral symmetry of the ( nearly ) massless @xmath294 and @xmath295 quarks by the formation of a @xmath1209 condensate at @xmath1210 when the @xmath68 colour force becomes strong ( see farhi and susskind 1981 ) .",
    "a generic technicolour scenario thus invokes new hyper - strong interactions with an intrinsic scale of @xmath1211 , due to gauge interactions with @xmath1212 unbroken technicolours .",
    "these interactions bind techniquarks @xmath1213 in the fundamental @xmath1214 representation of @xmath1215 , forming @xmath1216 ` technimeson ' and @xmath1217 ` technibaryon ' bound states .",
    "the latter will have integer spin if @xmath1214 is even , and the choice often favoured is @xmath1218 . in this case",
    "the lightest technimeson would be expected to be short - lived with @xmath1219 sec , thus evading bbn constraints , but the lightest technibaryon , which has a mass @xmath1220 is likely to be metastable , by analogy with the proton of qcd .",
    "indeed as in qcd , there is no renormalizable interaction that can cause technibaryon decay .",
    "however , the minimal technicolour model must in any case be extended to incorporate quark and lepton masses , and one might anticipate that it is unified in some kind of techni - gut .",
    "therefore one expects , in general , higher - order effective non - renormalizable interactions which cause technibaryon decay , of the form @xmath1221 where @xmath1222 is a quark or lepton field and @xmath1223 is some mass scale @xmath1224 at which the effective interaction is generated .",
    "these would imply a technibaryon lifetime @xmath1225 i.e. @xmath1226 , for the favoured case @xmath1218 with the minimal choice @xmath1227 .    estimating the self - annihilation cross - section of technibaryons to be ( e.g. chivukula and walker 1990 ) @xmath1228 the _ minimum _ expected relic abundance is @xmath1229 , where we have taken account of entropy generation following freeze - out at @xmath1230 .",
    "unstable technibaryons with such a small abundance are not constrained by nucleosynthesis ( dodelson 1989 ) .",
    "however technibaryons may have a much higher relic density if they possess an asymmetry of the same order as the baryon asymmetry ( nussinov 1985 ) .",
    "if the latter is due to a net @xmath732 generated at some high energy scale , then this would be subsequently distributed among _ all _ electroweak doublets by fermion - number violating processes in the standard model at temperatures above the electroweak scale ( see shaposhnikov 1991 , 1992 ) , thus naturally generating a technibaryon asymmetry as well .",
    "if such @xmath1231 violating processes cease being important below a temperature @xmath1232 , then the technibaryon - to - baryon ratio , which is suppressed by a factor @xmath1233^{3/2}\\e^{-m_{\\tb}(t_{*})/t_{*}}$ ] , is just right to give @xmath1234 ( barr 1990 ) , i.e. @xmath1235 . as can be seen from figures [ nxlimentexp ] and [ nxlimcascade ] , lifetimes between @xmath819 and @xmath1236 are forbidden for particles with such an abundance . if technibaryons decay with a longer lifetime , i.e. after ( re)combination , their decay products would be directly observable today .",
    "constraints from the diffuse gamma ray background ( dodelson 1989 ) as well as the diffuse high energy neutrino background ( gondolo 1993 ) then extend the lower lifetime bound all the way to @xmath1237 ( ellis 1992 ) , i.e. such particles should be essentially stable and an important component of the dark matter .",
    "these lifetimes bounds imply that @xmath1238 the former case would be applicable to any extended technicolour ( etc ) model containing interactions that violate technibaryon number , while the latter case could accomodate a techni - gut at the usual grand unification scale .",
    "another constraint on etc models follows from the bbn bound on @xmath272 .",
    "krauss ( 1993 ) note that such models typically contain right - handed neutrinos ( see king 1995 ) which can be produced through @xmath1239 which proceeeds through the exchange of etc gauge bosons of mass @xmath1240 .",
    "thus one should require this process to go out of equilibrium before the quark - hadron phase transition (  [ rel ] ) .",
    "krauss ( 1995 ) adopt the bound @xmath1241 to derive @xmath1242 where @xmath1243 is the relevant etc gauge coupling .",
    "while the above cosmological constraints on technicolour are not particularly restrictive , the basic idea has in any case fallen into disfavour because of the difficulties in constructing realistic phenomenological models which are consistent with experimental limits on flavour - changing neutral currents and light technipion states ( see king 1995 ) .",
    "also the radiative corrections to sm parameters are generally expected to be large ( see lane 1993 ) , in conflict with the experimental data ( see langacker 1994 ) .      because of such experimental difficulties with dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking , it is now generally accepted that the problems associated with a fundamental higgs boson are better cured by supersymmetry , in a manner consistent with all such experimental constraints ( see adriani 1993 , baer 1995 ) . as noted earlier , the quadratically divergent radiative corrections to the mass of a fundamental higgs scalar can be cancelled by postulating that for every known fermion ( boson ) , there is a boson ( fermion ) with the _ same _ interactions .",
    "thus each particle of the standard model must be accompanied by its superpartner  spin-@xmath1244 partners for the gauge and higgs bosons and spin-0 partners for the leptons and quarks  in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( see nilles 1984 , haber and kane 1985 ) .",
    "the lagrangian consists of a supersymmetric part with gauge interactions as in the sm while the yukawa interactions are derived from the ` superpotential ' @xmath1245 the chiral superfields @xmath1246 contain the lh quark doublets , @xmath1136 the lh lepton doublets , and @xmath1247 , @xmath1248 , @xmath1249 the charge conjugates of the rh up ",
    "type quarks , rh down  type quarks and rh electron  type leptons respectively .",
    "two higgs fields are required to give masses separately to the up - type charge 2/3 quarks , and to the down - type charge-1/3 quarks and leptons ; the last term is a mixing between them which is permitted by both gauge symmetry and supersymmetry ( see  [ nmssm ] ) .",
    "supersymmetry must neccessarily be broken in the low energy world since the superpartners of the known particles ( with the same mass ) have not been observed .",
    "however if supersymmetry is to provide a solution to the hierarchy problem , the mass - splitting @xmath1250 between ordinary particles and their superpartners can not be significantly higher than the electroweak scale .",
    "although superparticles particles have not yet been directly produced at accelerators , they would influence through their virtual effects , the evolution with energy of the gauge couplings in the standard model .",
    "interestingly enough , the precision data from demonstrate that only in this case would there be the desired unification of all three couplings ( e.g ellis 1991 , amaldi 1991 , langacker and luo 1991 , see de boer 1994 ) ; further this happens at a sufficiently high energy ( @xmath1251 ) , so as to account for the failure to detect proton decay upto a lifetime of @xmath1252 ( see perkins 1984 , particle data group 1996 ) which rules out most non - susy guts ( see langacker 1981 , enqvist and nanopoulos 1986 ) . reversing the argument , a susy - gut can then predict , say the weak mixing angle , to a precision better than @xmath1253 , in excellent agreement with experiment ( see dimopoulos 1995 , ellis 1995 ) .",
    "another attraction of supersymmetry is that it provides a natural mechanism for breaking of the electroweak symmetry at the correct energy scale through radiative corrections to the higgs mass , if the top quark is sufficiently heavy ( see ibez and ross 1993 ) ; the recently discovered top quark does indeed have the required mass ( ross and roberts 1992 ) .    the first phenomenological models to be constructed attempted to incorporate global supersymmetry down to the electroweak scale ( see fayet and ferrara 1975 ) .",
    "such models therefore contain a massless goldstino ( @xmath1254 ) , the spin-@xmath1244 fermion associated with the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry at a scale of @xmath1255 , as well as a new light spin-@xmath1244 fermion , the photino ( @xmath1256 ) .",
    "both the goldstino and photino couple to matter with strength comparable to a doublet neutrino ( see fayet 1979 ) .",
    "thus , having two degrees of freedom each , they count as two extra neutrino species during nucleosynthesis and thus are in conflict with the often used bound @xmath1069 ( dimopoulos and turner 1982 ) , or even our conservative bound @xmath1194 . therefore it is neccessary to make these particles decouple earlier than the quark - hadron phase transition in order to dilute their abundance . to weaken their interactions",
    "adequately then requires that the supersymmetry breaking scale be raised above @xmath1257 ( sciama 1982 )    however models with global supersymmetry have severe difficulties , e.g. in generating the neccessary mass - splitting of @xmath1258 between ordinary particles and their superpartners , and because they possess a large cosmological constant which can not even be fine tuned to zero ( see fayet 1984 ) .",
    "thus it is neccessary to consider _ local _ supersymmetry , i.e. supergravity ( see van nieuwenhuizen 1981 ) , which provides an implicit link with gravity .",
    "( indeed superstring theories ( see green 1993 ) which unify gravity with the other interactions , albeit in a higher - dimensional space , yield supergravity as the effective field theory in four - dimensions at energies small compared to the compactification scale which is of order @xmath1259 . ) in supergravity models , the goldstino is eliminated by the super - higgs mechanism which gives a mass to the gravitino , spin-@xmath1260 superpartner of the graviton ( deser and zumino 1977 ) .",
    "the helicity-@xmath1260 components interact only gravitationally ; however if the gravitino mass is very small then its interactions are governed by its helicity-@xmath1244 component which is just the goldstino associated with global susy breaking ( fayet 1979 ) . at energies much smaller than the superpartner masses , the typical scattering cross - section is @xmath1261 ( fayet 1979 ) , assuming that the photino is also light .",
    "hence a sufficiently light gravitino would have the same cosmological abundance as a massless two - component neutrino . requiring that the gravitino decouple at a temperature @xmath1262 ( see ) then implies ( fayet 1982 )",
    "@xmath1263 which is rather more restrictive than the lower limit of @xmath1264 deduced from laboratory experiments ( see fayet 1987 ) .",
    "in fact the gravitino is expected to be much heavier in the class of supergravity models which have been phenomenologically most successful ( see nath 1984 , nilles 1984 ) . here",
    "supersymmetry is broken by non - perturbative dynamics at a scale @xmath64 in a ` hidden sector ' which interacts with the visible sector only through gravitational interactions ( witten 1981b , see nilles 1990 ) .",
    "( e.g. dine and nelson 1993 , dine 1996 ) . ]",
    "supersymmetry breaking is then communicated to the low energy world only through ` soft ' supersymmetry breaking masses for the sfermions and gauginos ( superpartners of the fermions and gauge bosons ) and a mass for the gravitino , all of which are of order the effective supersymmetry breaking scale in the visible sector , i.e. close to the electroweak scale ( e.g. barbieri 1982 , chamseddine 1982 , nilles 1983 , alvarez - gaume 1983 ) .",
    "thus if supersymmetry is to solve the gauge hierarchy problem , the gravitino mass must be no higher than @xmath1265 .",
    "this however poses a serious cosmological problem as we discuss below .      at high energies ,",
    "the dominant interactions of the gravitino with other particles and their superpartners at high energies come from its helicity-@xmath1260 component ( rather than its helicity-@xmath1244 goldstino component ) .",
    "for example it can decay into a gauge boson @xmath1266 and its gaugino partner @xmath1267 through a dimension-5 operator , with lifetime @xmath1268 where @xmath290 is the number of available channels , e.g. @xmath1269 assuming @xmath1270 .",
    "it was first noted by weinberg ( 1982 ) that notwithstanding their very weak interactions , massive gravitinos would have been abundantly produced in the early universe at temperatures close to the planck scale and would thus come to matter - dominate the universe when the temperature dropped below their mass .",
    "their subsequent decays would then completely disrupt primordial nucleosynthesis , thus creating a cosmological crisis for supergravity .",
    "it was suggested ( ellis 1983 , krauss 1983a ) that this problem could be solved by invoking an inflationary phase , just as for gut monopoles .",
    "however , unlike the latter , gravitinos can be recreated by scattering processes during the inevitable reheating phase following inflation as well as ( in a model - dependent manner ) through direct decays of the scalar field driving inflation ( nanopoulos 1983 ) . the gravitino abundance produced by @xmath136 processes involving gauge bosons and gauginos during reheating",
    "was computed by ellis ( 1984b ) to be , @xmath1271\\ , \\ ] ] at @xmath817 , where @xmath1272 is the maximum temperature reached during reheating .",
    "this is a conservative lower bound to the true abundance , for example kawasaki and moroi ( 1995a ) estimate an abundance higher by a factor of 4 after including interaction terms between the gravitino and chiral multiplets .",
    "recently fischler ( 1994 ) has claimed that gravitinos can be brought into thermal equilibrium at temperatures well below the planck scale via interactions of their goldstino component with a cross - section which increases as @xmath1273 due to the breaking of supersymmetry by finite temperature effects .",
    "if so , their production during reheating would be far more efficient and yield a relic abundance @xmath1274 however leigh and rattazzi ( 1995 ) argue on general grounds that there can be no such enhancement of gravitino production .",
    "ellis ( 1996 ) perform an explicit calculation of finite - temperature effects for @xmath1275 and demonstrate that these do not alter the estimate in .",
    "the bbn constraints on massive decaying particles shown in figures [ nxlimentexp ] and [ nxlimcascade ] then provide a restrictive upper limit to the reheating temperature after inflation , dependent on the gravitino lifetime .",
    "for example , ellis ( 1985b ) quoted @xmath1276 ( taking @xmath1277 ) , from simple considerations of @xmath554 overproduction due to @xmath311 photofission which gave the constraint @xmath1278 shown as a dashed line in .",
    "however , as is seen from the figure , a more detailed calculation of this process ( ellis 1992 ) actually yields a more restrictive constraint for a radiative lifetime greater than @xmath1279 , corresponding to @xmath1280 , but a less stringent constraint for shorter lifetimes .",
    "overproduction , which , as noted earlier , disagrees with both the analytic estimate of ellis ( 1992 ) as well as the monte carlo calculation of protheroe ( 1995 ) . ] .",
    "hence the true bound is ( taking @xmath1277 ) , @xmath1281 using the results of ellis ( 1992 ) we have obtained the upper bound on @xmath1272 implied by the relic abundance as a function of the gravitino mass ( calculated using the lifetime ) and show this in . for a gravitino mass of @xmath1282 , the radiative lifetime is about @xmath1283 and the best constraint now comes from requiring that the photofission of deuterium not reduce its abundance below the observational lower limit ( juszkiewicz 1985 , dimopoulos 1989 )",
    ". the improved calculation of ellis ( 1992 ) gives for this bound , @xmath1284 where we have taken @xmath1285 as is appropriate for such a massive gravitino .",
    "photofission processes become ineffective for @xmath1286 but now there are new constraints from the effect of hadrons in the showers on the @xmath1287he abundance ( reno and seckel 1989 , dimopoulos 1989 ) . if the gravitino mass is @xmath1288 with a corresponding lifetime of @xmath1289 , this bound is @xmath1290 weinberg ( 1982 ) had suggested that the entropy release in the decays of a gravitino of mass exceeding @xmath1257 would reheat the universe to a temperature high enough to restart nucleosynthesis , thus evading the cosmological problem .",
    "however , as noted earlier , particle decays following an exponential decay law can not actually raise the temperature but only slow down its rate of decrease ( scherrer and turner 1985 ) , hence one should really require the gravitino to be massive enough that it decays before the begining of nucleosynthesis .",
    "a careful calculation by scherrer ( 1991 ) taking into account the effects of hadronic decays shows that the lower bound on the mass is then @xmath1291 however such a large gravitino mass can not be accomodated in ( minimal ) supergravity models without destabilizing the hierarchy .",
    "other constraints on the gravitino abundance follow from examination of the effects of the annihilation of antiprotons produced in the decay chain @xmath1292 ( khlopov and linde 1984 , ellis 1985b , halm 1987 , dominguez - tenreiro 1987 ) but these are not as restrictive as those given above .",
    "the effects of the decay @xmath1293 have been studied by de laix and scherrer ( 1993 ) . correcting earlier estimates by frieman and giudice ( 1989 ) and gratsias ( 1991 ) ,",

    "this requires ( ellis 1985b ) : @xmath1296 while the decays of the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) , typically the neutralino @xmath1297 , can presumably be made consistent with the bbn constraints since such particles can usually self - annihilate sufficiently strongly to reduce their relic abundance to an acceptable level .",
    "moroi ( 1993 ) have reexamined this question and taken into account the ( small ) additional gravitino production from the nlsp decays .",
    "they note that the relic @xmath1297 abundance according to recent calculations ( e.g. drees and nojiri 1993 ) is in fact sufficiently high ( essentially due to improved lower limits on sparticle masses ) that the @xmath554 photoproduction constraint calculated by ellis ( 1992 ) requires @xmath1298 . for this to be so , the neutralino has to be sufficiently heavy relative to the gravitino , e.g for @xmath1299 , the gravitino mass must be less than @xmath1300 , but for @xmath1301 the gravitino mass can be as high as @xmath1302 .",
    "moroi ( 1993 ) also reevaluate the bound on @xmath1272 following from the relic energy density argument for a stable gravitino which is much lighter than the sfermions .",
    "they consider the regime @xmath1303 for which they find that the gravitino ( goldstino ) annihilation cross - section is enhanced proportional to @xmath1304 so that the bound on @xmath1272 from consideration of the relic energy density decreases proportionally to @xmath1305 .",
    "of course this bound evaporates when the gravitino becomes sufficiently light that its relic abundance from thermal equilibrium ( at the planck scale ) comes within observational constraints .",
    "this limiting mass is ( pagels and primack 1982 ) @xmath1306 the increase by a factor of @xmath651 over the corresponding bound for neutrinos is because of the dilution by a factor of @xmath651 of gravitinos ( which decouple at @xmath1307 ) relative to neutrinos which decouple at a few mev ( see ) .",
    "moroi also consider the effect of a light gravitino on the speed - up rate during bbn following fayet ( 1982 ) ( see ) .",
    "they find that the relevant dominant thermalization process is gravitino ( goldstino ) annihilation to light lepton pairs and obtain the bound @xmath1308 by requiring decoupling at @xmath1309 ( corresponding to the constraint @xmath1310 )",
    ". however gherghetta ( 1996 ) notes that in the more appropriate regime @xmath1311 , the dominant equilibrating process is actually gravitino ( goldstino ) annihilation into photons , the cross - section for which is considerably smaller .",
    "thus the mass bound is weakened to @xmath1312 if the gravitinos are required to decouple at @xmath1262 , corresponding to the constraint @xmath1313 ( compare with the bound obtained assuming a light photino ) .",
    "note that such a reduction of the annihilation cross - section would also degrade the bounds on @xmath1272 quoted by moroi ( 1993 ) .",
    "the realization that the f - r - w universe we inhabit can not have achieved a temperature higher than @xmath1314 , if the production of electroweak scale relic gravitinos is to be adequately suppressed , had a big impact on phenomenological models of baryogenesis . a decade ago when these bounds were first presented ( e.g. ellis 1985b ) baryogenesis was generally believed to be due to the out - of - equilibrium @xmath13-violating decays of heavy bosons with masses of order the unification scale ( see kolb and turner 1983 ) . in supersymmetric models , protons can decay efficiently through dimension-5 operators ( see enqvist and nanopoulos 1986 ) , hence the experimental lower bounds @xmath1315 ( particle data goup 1996 ) then implies that the mass of the relevant ( higgs triplet ) bosons is rather large , viz .",
    "@xmath1316 ( e.g. ellis 1982 ) .",
    "it may be possible to suppress the dangerous dimension-5 operators ( e.g. coughlan 1985 ) but even so one has a lower limit @xmath1317 from consideration of the ( unavoidable ) dimension-6 operators .",
    "such heavy particles _ can not _ be thermally generated after inflation given the associated bounds on gravitino production , hence the standard scenario for baryogenesis is no longer viable !    this conflict motivated studies of various alternative possibilities .",
    "one suggestion was that the higgs triplets could be created directly through the decays of the scalar field driving inflation ( coughlan 1985 , mahajan 1986 ) .",

    "a similar idea is to invoke decays of the inflaton into squarks , which decay in turn creating a baryon asymmetry if the superpotential includes a term which violates @xmath17-parity ( dimopoulos and hall 1987 ) . here",
    ", the reheat temperature is required to be very low , less than a few gev , in order that the generated asymmetry is not washed out by scattering processes and inverse decays .",
    "another suggestion due to fukugita and yanagida ( 1986 ) which has received much attention is that the out - of - equilibrium @xmath1136-violating decays of heavy right - handed neutrinos generate a _",
    "asymmetry , which is subsequently reprocessed by @xmath732 conserving fermion number violating interactions in the standard model ( see below ) into a baryon asymmetry .",
    "the @xmath1191 should thus have a mass less that @xmath1319 , which in turn imposes an interesting _ lower _ limit on the masses of the light ( left - handed ) neutrinos generated by the ` see - saw ' mechanism , @xmath1320 ( see plmacher 1996 ) .",
    "a different approach is to try and evade the gravitino problem altogether by decoupling the gravitino mass from the electroweak scale , i.e. making it lighter than @xmath1321 ) , or heavier than @xmath1322 . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "this is not possible in minimal supergravity but can be achieved in ` no - scale ' supergravity models which are based on non - compact khler manifolds ( see lahanas and nanopoulos 1987 ) .",

    "thus the identification of the gravitino problem stimulated the study of mechanisms for low temperature baryogenesis .",
    "coincidentally two such possibilities were proposed at that time and these have since come under intense scrutiny ( see dolgov 1992 ) .",
    "the first followed the realization that since fermion number is violated ( although @xmath732 is conserved ) even in the standard model at temperatures above the electroweak scale ( kuzmin 1985 ) , a baryon asymmetry may be generated utilising the ( small ) cp violation in the ckm mixing of the quarks if the neccessary out - of - equilibrium conditions can be achieved during the electroweak phase transition .",
    "( these detailed studies indicate however that successful baryogenesis probably requires extension of the sm to include , e.g. supersymmetry , in order to increase the sources of @xmath14 violation as well as make the electroweak phase transition sufficiently first - order ( see krauss and rey 1992 , cohen 1994 , rubakov and shaposhnikov 1996 ) .",
    "the second mechanism , specific to supergravity models , is based on the observation that sfermion fields will develop large expectation values along ` flat ' directions in the scalar potential during the inflationary phase ( affleck and dine 1984 ) .",
    "a baryon asymmetry can then be generated at a much lower temperature , when the hubble parameter becomes less than the effective mass , as the coherent oscillations in the fields decay ( e.g. ellis 1987 ) .",
    "recently , dine ( 1995 , 1996 ) have emphasized the role of non - renormalizable operators in the superpotential in stabilizing the flat direction and shown that a baryon asymmetry of the required magnitude can indeed arise .    in inflationary models ,",
    "the reheat temperature @xmath1272 is determined by the couplings to matter fields of the scalar ` inflaton ' field @xmath1323 , which drives inflation at an energy scale @xmath1324 .",
    "inflation ends when @xmath1323 evolves to the minimum of its potential and begins to oscillate about it until it decays , converting its vacuum energy , @xmath1325 , into radiation .",
    "the inflaton is required to be a gauge singlet in order that its quantum fluctuations during the vacuum energy dominated ` de sitter phase ' of expansion do not generate temperature fluctuations in the cmb in excess of those observed by ( see olive 1990a ) .",
    "thus its couplings to matter fields are neccessarily very weak and reheating is a slow process .",
    "the inflaton mass is @xmath1326 and its decay width is @xmath1327 so the maximum temperature reached during reheating is @xmath1328 the requirement that this be less than the phenomenological bound imposed by the gravitino problem poses a serious challenge for inflationary models ( see bintruy 1985 , enqvist 1986 , olive 1990a ) . as mentioned earlier the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field generates density perturbations as it ` rolls ' down its potential ( see brandenberger 1985 ) and these induce temperature fluctuations in the cmb .",
    "the measurement of the cmb quadrupole anisotropy then fixes the amplitude of these perturbations on spatial scales of order the present hubble radius and imposes an independent constraint on the ratio of the vacuum energy to the slope of the inflaton scalar potential .",
    "since the vacuum energy is already bounded by the reheat constraint , this translates into an upper bound on the slope of the potential at the point where these fluctuations are generated , which can be identified by solving the equation of motion for the inflaton .",
    "ross and sarkar ( 1996 ) have shown that when the scalar potential is given by minimal @xmath1329 supergravity ( cremmer 1979 , 1983 ) , this constraint is _ not _ satisfied by generic ` chaotic ' inflationary models ( see linde 1990 ) wherein the inflaton evolves towards its global minimum at the origin from an initial vev beyond the planck scale .",
    "however it is easy to satisfy this constraint in a ` new ' inflationary model ( holman 1984 ) where the inflaton evolves from an initial value at the origin towards its minimum at the planck scale .",
    "the scalar potential is then as flat as is required , with @xmath1330 , i.e. @xmath1331 of @xmath1332 as mentioned earlier . two observationally testable consequences of this model are that gravitational waves contribute negligibly to the cmb anisotropy and the spectrum of scalar density perturbations is ` tilted ' with a slope of about 0.9 , which improves the fit to the observed clustering and motions of galaxies in an universe dominated by cold dark matter ( sarkar 1996 , adams 1996 ) .",
    "a related issue is the aforementioned polonyi problem ( coughlan 1983 , 1984 , dine 1984 , goncharov 1984 ) associated with very weakly coupled light scalar fields which are driven out to large vevs along flat directions during the de sitter phase ( if the hubble parameter exceeds their mass ) .",
    "subsequently the field evolves towards its minimum just like the inflaton field and eventually reaches the minimum and oscillates about it converting the stored vacuum energy into radiation .",
    "however this happens very late for a light singlet field ( see ) hence the universe reheats to a temperature _ below _ the value of @xmath867 required for starting off successful nucleosynthesis .",
    "hence it is essential to address this problem which is particularly acute in models derived from ( compactified ) string theories , because of the associated ` moduli ' fields which do exhibit such flat directions and have masses at most of order the electroweak scale , giving a reheat temperature of @xmath1333 ( e.g. de carlos 1993 , banks 1994 ) .",
    "one way to evade this is to invoke a second phase of inflation with a hubble parameter _",
    "smaller _ than the moduli mass , with a reheat temperature high enough not to disturb nucleosynthesis ( randall and thomas 1995 ) ; the second epoch of inflation must of course be short enough not to erase the density perturbations produced in the initial inflationary era but long enough to solve the moduli problem . a natural mechanism for such ` thermal inflation '",
    "thas recently been identified in models with an intermediate symetry breaking scale ( lyth and stewart 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "there are other possible solutions to the moduli problem ( e.g. dine 1995 , 1996 , thomas 1995 , banks 1995a , b , ross and sarkar 1996 , linde 1996 )  for example all moduli may have vevs fixed by a stage of symmetry breaking _ before _ inflation , or the moduli minima may be the _ same _ during and after inflation , corresponding to a point of enhanced symmetry . in the first case , the ` dilaton ' field , which determines the string coupling , should also acquire a ( non - perturbative ) mass much higher than the electroweak scale since otherwise the curvature of the potential in the dilaton direction is too great to allow for a period of inflation ( brustein and steinhardt 1993 ) . in both cases",
    "the implication is that the moduli _ can not",
    "_ be treated ( cf .",
    "kounnas 1994 , bintruy and dudas 1995 , dimopoulos 1995 ) as dynamical variables at the electroweak scale , determining the couplings in the low energy theory .",
    "all this is a direct consequence of the requirement that standard bbn not be disrupted by the late release of entropy !      as we have seen , the major motivation for adding ( softly broken ) supersymmetry to the standard model is to bring under control the quadratic divergences associated with a fundamental higgs boson and make it ` natural ' for its mass to be at the electroweak scale .",
    "however the minimal version of the supersymmetric standard model has a new naturalness problem associated with the mixing term @xmath1335 between the two higgs doublets ( see ) . for successful phenomenology @xmath1334",
    "should also be of order the electroweak scale but there is no symmetry which ensures this  the ` @xmath1334problem ' ( e.g. hall 1983 , kim and nilles 1984 ) . to address this ,",
    "the mssm is extended by the addition of a singlet higgs superfield @xmath1336 in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) ( e.g. nilles 1983 , derendinger and savoy 1984 ) . by invoking a @xmath1337 symmetry under which every chiral superfield @xmath1338 transforms as @xmath1339 , the allowed terms in the superpotential are @xmath1340 while the higgs part of the soft supersymmetry breaking potential is extended by the inclusion of two additional trilinear soft terms @xmath1341 and @xmath1342 to @xmath1343 where @xmath1344 .",
    "the @xmath1334term can now be simply set to zero by invoking the @xmath1337 symmetry .",
    "an effective @xmath1334term of the form @xmath1345 will still be generated during @xmath1346 breaking but it is straightforward to arrange that @xmath1347 is of order a soft supersymmetry breaking mass . apart from solving the ` @xmath1334problem ' the nmssm has interesting implications for supersymmetric higgs phenomenology ( e.g. ellis 1989 , elliot 1994 ) and dark matter ( e.g. olive and thomas 1991 , abel 1993 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the nmssm has a cosmological problem .",
    "the @xmath1337 of the model is broken during the phase transition associated with electroweak symmetry breaking in the early universe . due to the existence of causal horizons in an evolving universe , such spontaneously broken discrete symmetries",
    "lead to the formation of domains of different degenerate vacua separated by domain walls ( zeldovich , kobzarev and okun 1975 , kibble 1976 ) .",
    "these have a surface energy density @xmath1348 , where @xmath1349 is a typical vev of the fields , here of order the electroweak scale .",
    "such walls would come to dominate the energy density of the universe and create unacceptably large anisotropies in the cmb unless their energy scale is less than a few mev ( see vilenkin 1985 ) .",
    "therefore cosmology requires electroweak scale walls to disappear well before the present era . following the original suggestion by zeldovich ( 1975 ) , this may be achieved by breaking the degeneracy of the vacua , eventually leading to the dominance of the true vacuum .",
    "this happens when the pressure @xmath1350 , i.e. the difference in energy density between the distinct vacua , begins to exceed the tension @xmath1351 , where @xmath1352 is the surface energy density of the walls and @xmath17 the scale of their curvature .",
    "when @xmath17 becomes large enough for the pressure term to dominate , the domain corresponding to the true vacuum begins to expand into the domains of false vacuum and eventually fills all of space .",
    "it has been argued ( ellis 1986a , rai and senjanovi 1994 ) that strong gravitational interactions at the planck scale , which are expected to explicitly violate any discrete symmetry , would cause just such a non - degeneracy in the minima of @xmath1353 where @xmath1349 is a generic vev , of @xmath1354 in the present case .",
    "abel ( 1995 ) have tested whether the above solution is indeed viable by studying the cosmological evolution of the walls under the influence of the tension , the pressure due to the small explicit @xmath1337 breaking and the friction due to particle reflections ( see vilenkin and shellard 1994 ) .",
    "they find that in order to prevent wall domination of the energy density of the universe one requires @xmath1355 , a pressure which can be produced by dimension-6 operators in the potential .",
    "a much tighter constraint however comes from requiring that primordial nucleosynthesis not be disrupted by the decays of the walls into quarks and leptons .",
    "the energy density released in such collisions at time @xmath94 is @xmath1356 the walls must disappear before @xmath1357 to ensure that the hadrons produced in their decays do not alter the neutron - to - proton ratio , resulting in a @xmath1287he mass fraction in excess of @xmath616 ( see ) .",
    "this requires the magnitude of explicit @xmath1337 breaking to be @xmath1358 with @xmath1359 .",
    "thus addition of a dimension-5 non - renormalizable operator to the superpotential is sufficient to evade the cosmological constraints .",
    "however this creates a naturalness problem since introduction of non - renormalizable terms together with soft supersymmetry breaking produces corrections to the potential which are quadratically divergent and thus proportional to powers of the cut - off @xmath64 in the effective supergravity theory ( e.g. ellwanger 1983 , bagger and poppitz 1993 ) .",
    "since the natural scale for this cut - off is @xmath1259 , these can destabilize the hierarchy , forcing the singlet vev ( and hence the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking ) upto , at least , the hidden sector scale of @xmath1360 . by examining the possible dimension-5 @xmath1337 breaking terms , abel ( 1995 )",
    "demonstrate that this can be averted only if the coefficient @xmath1361 in is smaller than @xmath1362 .",
    "thus the nmssm has either a cosmological domain wall problem or a hierarchy problem .",
    "a possible solution is to reintroduce the @xmath1334 term in the superpotential in such a way as to avoid the introduction of the dangerous non - renormalizable operators . by allowing specific couplings of the hidden sector fields to the visible sector ( giudice and masiero 1988 )",
    ", one can retain @xmath1337 symmetry in the full theory but break it spontaneously when supersymmetry is broken ; then the hierarchy is not destabilized by tadpole diagrams .",
    "nevetheless allowed operators which would give @xmath1336 a mass of order the susy breaking scale still have to be set to zero by hand and this constitutes a naturalness problem of at least one part in @xmath1363 ( abel 1995 ) .",
    "apart from the terms in the mssm superpotential shown in , one can in general add other gauge - invariant terms such as ( hall and suzuki 1984 ) @xmath1364 where @xmath1365 and @xmath1366 are the @xmath305-doublet lepton and quark superfields and @xmath1367 are the singlet superfields .",
    "these are phenomenologically dangerous since the @xmath1267 and @xmath1368 couplings violate lepton number , while @xmath1369 couplings violate baryon number .",
    "hence such couplings are usually eliminated by enforcing a discrete symmetry termed @xmath17parity , @xmath1370 ( farrar and fayet 1978 ) .",
    "this has the additional important consequence that the lightest superpartner ( lsp ) is absolutely stable and therefore a good dark matter candidate .",
    "however , an exact @xmath17-parity is not essential from a theoretical point of view , since rapid proton decay can be prevented by simply requiring that all the @xmath1371 in be zero as a consequence of an underlying symmetry .-",
    "parity may also be broken spontaneously if a neutral scalar field , viz .",
    "the sneutrino , gets a vev ( aulakh and mohapatra 1982 ) but this gives rise to a problematical massless goldstone boson , the majoron , unless explicit @xmath1372 is also introduced in some way .",
    "moreover , this induces a neutrino mass and the scenario is thus constrained by the bbn bounds (  [ nudecays ] ) on an unstable @xmath394 ( e.g. ellis 1985a ) . ]",
    "it has been argued ( campbell 1991 , fischler 1991 ) that the other terms must also be zero or very small in order for a primordial baryon asymmetry to survive since this requires that @xmath13 and/or @xmath1136-violating interactions should not have come into thermal equilibrium above the electroweak scale when ( @xmath732 conserving ) fermion number violation is already unsuppressed in the standard model ( kuzmin 1985 ) .",
    "however this can be evaded , for example , through lepton mass effects which allow a baryon asymmetry to be regenerated at the electroweak scale through sphaleron processes if there is a primordial flavour - dependent lepton asymmetry ( kuzmin 1987 , dreiner and ross 1993 ) .",
    "interactions such as the dim-9 operator @xmath1373 ( usually heavy higgs exchange in unified theories ) which mediate neutron - antineutron oscillations ( mohapatra and marshak 1980 ) .",
    "such processes involve only quark fields , hence no flavour symmetry can be separately conserved because of ckm mixing .",
    "the experimental lower limit @xmath1374 ( particle data group 1996 ) implies that such oscillations can have no influence on nucleosynthesis ( sarkar 1988 ) .",
    "demanding that such processes do not come into thermal equilibrium in the early universe requires @xmath1375 ( campbell 1991 , 1992b ) .",
    "] there are also other possibilities for protecting a baryon asymmetry ( e.g. campbell 1992a , cline 1994 ) so this is not a firm constraint .",
    "the cosmological consequences of @xmath17-parity violation have been examined by bouquet and salati ( 1987 ) .",
    "the lsp , which is usually the neutralino , is now unstable against tree - level decays ( similar to a heavy neutrino ) with lifetime @xmath1376 where @xmath1377 is the mass of the squark / slepton as appropriate to the @xmath1372 coupling @xmath1267 under consideration .",
    "such decays must of course occur early enough so as not to disturb bbn , hence the arguments of  [ nonrel ] impose a _",
    "lower _ bound on the @xmath1372 coupling .",
    "the precise bound on the lifetime depends on the decay mode , e.g. whether or not the final state includes hadrons .",
    "the relic abundance of a lsp heavier than a few mev freezes - out before bbn , therefore the usual calculation ( e.g. ellis 1984a ) can be used , ignoring the effect of lsp decays .",
    "for example , a neutralino of mass @xmath1378 has a relic abundance of @xmath1379 ; if it decays through the operators @xmath1380 or @xmath1381 creating hadronic showers , then shows that we can require @xmath1382 , i.e. @xmath1383 ( laboratory experiments looking for @xmath1372 effects are sensitive to a _ maximum _",
    "lifetime of @xmath1384 so can only probe @xmath1385 . ) of course @xmath1267 may be very small ( or indeed zero ! ) making the neutralino lifetime longer than the age of the universe . then the bbn constraints do not apply but arguments based on the absence of a high energy neutrino background require the lifetime to be higher than @xmath1237 ( gondolo 1993 ) , thus implying @xmath1386 ( e.g. campbell 1992b ) .",
    "similar arguments have been used to constrain the destabilization of the lsp through @xmath1372 in the singlet sector of the nmssm ( allahverdi 1994 ) .",
    "phenomenological models `` motivated '' by the superstring often contain additional neutral particles in each fermion generation , notably right - handed neutrinos which are singlets of the standard model ( see ellis 1987 , hewett and rizzo 1989 ) .",
    "these are often massless or very light and thus relativistic at the time of nucleosynthesis .",
    "however they couple to matter not through the @xmath148 but through a hypothetical new neutral gauge boson @xmath1387 which is experimentally required to be heavier than the @xmath148 .",
    "thus the @xmath1191 energy density at the time of nucleosynthesis will be suppressed relative to the conventional @xmath1388 if its interactions are sufficiently weak ( i.e. the @xmath1387 is sufficiently heavy ) to move the @xmath1191 decoupling back earlier than some epoch of entropy generation , e.g. @xmath1389 annihilation or the quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "then each @xmath1191 will only count as a fraction of a @xmath1388 and possibly satisfy the bbn bound on @xmath272 , which thus translates into a lower bound on the mass of the @xmath1387 .",
    "ellis ( 1986b ) argued for the conservative constraint @xmath1390 and noted that this would permit one additional @xmath1191 per generation if these decoupled before @xmath1389 annihilation thus ensuring @xmath1391 .",
    "as discussed in  [ rel ] , this requires @xmath1392 , but a more careful analysis of decoupling yields a bound _",
    "less _ stringent than this na\"ve estimate ( ellis 1986b ) @xmath1393 for the @xmath1394 model obtained from calabi - yau compactification ( witten 1985b , dine 1985 ) , the couplings of the new gauge boson @xmath1395 are specified , e.g. @xmath1396 , enabling the annihilation cross - section above to be computed ( ellis 1986b ) .",
    "the above argument then gives @xmath1397 , which has only recently been matched by direct experimental bounds on such a new gauge boson ( particle data group 1996 ) .",
    "of course the cosmological bound would be more stringent still if one were to adopt a more restrictive constraint , e.g. taking @xmath1398 would require @xmath1399 ( ellis 1986b ) .",
    "even more restrictive bounds have been quoted ( steigman 1986 , gonzalez - garcia and valle 1990 , lopez and nanopoulos 1990 , faraggi and nanopoulos 1991 ) but these were based on an approximate treatment of decoupling and adopted more restrictive , but less reliable , constraints from bbn .",
    "perhaps the most crucial issue in phenomenological supergravity concerns how supersymmetry is actually broken . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the most popular option is to break supersymmetry non - perturbatively in a hidden sector which interacts with the visible sector only through gravitational interactions ( see amati 1988 , nilles 1990 ) or through gauge interactions ( dine and nelson 1993 ) . a spontaneously broken @xmath17-symmetry is neccessary and sufficient for such dynamical supersymmetry breaking ( affleck 1985 , nelson and seiberg 1994 ) and implies the existence of a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson , the @xmath17-axion . in renormalizable hidden sector models ,",
    "the axion has a decay constant of @xmath1400 and a mass of @xmath1401 , where @xmath1402 is the effective scale of susy breaking in the hidden sector .",
    "the axion field is set oscillating during inflation and the energy density contained in such oscillations after reheating is released as the axions decay into both visible particles and gravitinos . as discussed by bagger ( 1994 )",
    "this is constrained by the bounds on massive decaying particles discussed in  [ nonrel ] .",
    "the implied upper limit on the reheat temperature is found to be competetive with that obtained (  [ gravprob ] ) from considerations of thermal gravitino generation .",
    "( bagger ( 1994 ) also note that in visible sector models wherein susy breaking is communicated through gauge interactions , it is neccessary to have @xmath1403 higher than @xmath1404 in order to make the axion heavier than @xmath1405 so as to evade astrophysical bounds ( see raffelt 1990 ) . )    in non - renormalizable hidden sector models , the scale of gaugino condensation in the hidden sector due to planck scale interactions is @xmath1406 and the @xmath17-axion mass is of @xmath1407 while its decay constant is of @xmath1408 .",
    "banks ( 1994 ) note that this will give rise to a polonyi problem and conclude that all such models are thus ruled out .",
    "however rangarajan ( 1995a ) has specifically considered the @xmath1409 superstring model compactified on a calabi - yau manifold ( gross 1985 ) and calculated the energy density in the coherent oscillations of the axions given their low temperature potential ( e.g. choi and kim 1985 ) .",
    "he finds that the axions decay before nucleosynthesis as required (  [ nonrel ] ) if @xmath1410 consistent with the expected value of @xmath1411 ( derendinger 1985 ) .",
    "the decay of the axion oscillations does increase the comoving entropy by a factor of @xmath1412 , but this is deemed acceptable if baryogenesis occurs by the affleck - dine mechanism ( rangarajan 1995b ) .",
    "yet another application of bbn bounds has been to orbifold compactifications of the superstring wherein supersymmetry is broken _ perturbatively _ by the scherk - schwarz mechanism at the electroweak scale ( e.g. rohm 1984 , antoniadis 1988 , ferrara 1989 ) by postulating the existence of a large internal dimension ( see antoniadis 1991 ) .",
    "thus , in addition to the mssm , these models contain a repeating spectrum of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes all the way up to the planck scale , whose spacing ( @xmath1413 , where @xmath17 is the radius of compactification ) is comparable to the supersymmetry breaking scale of @xmath1255 .",
    "such modes can be directly excited at forthcoming accelerators such as the lhc ( antoniadis 1994 ) , hence this possibility is of great experimental interest .",
    "these modes will also be excited in the early universe and this radically alters the thermal history ( abel and sarkar 1995 ) .",
    "the kk modes are labelled by quantum numbers of internal momenta / charges which are of the form @xmath1414 where @xmath17 represents some internal radius of compactification .",
    "the winding modes ( @xmath1415 ) have masses of @xmath1408 and need not be considered further , while the particles in the @xmath1416th kk mode have masses @xmath1417 . thus above the compactification scale , when the temperature rises by @xmath1418 , two new levels of ( gauge interacting ) kk excitations become relativistic , so that the number of relativistic degrees of freedom increases _ linearly _ with temperature .",
    "for example , the number of entropic degrees of freedom rises above the limiting value @xmath1419 in the mssm according to @xmath1420 where the constant @xmath1421 is determined by evaluating the entropy density of the plasma .",
    "( in the spontaneously broken string theories , each kk level comes in @xmath1422 multiplets , so that kk gauge bosons contribute 8 bosonic and 8 fermionic degrees of freedom in the vector and fermionic representations of so(8 ) respectively ; in the minimal case in which the kk excitations are in @xmath1423 multiplets , this gives e.g. @xmath1424 . ) thus at a temperature much higher than the kk level - spacing ( @xmath1425 ) , nearly all the entropy is contained in the kk modes and almost none in the matter multiplets . by entropy conservation , the hubble expansion rate",
    "is then altered from its usual form as @xmath1426 now consider the history of the universe starting from the maximum temperature it reached , viz .",
    "the reheating temperature @xmath1272 ( @xmath1427 ) at the end of inflation .",
    "the entropy is initially evenly spread out amongst the strongly ( as opposed to gravitationally ) interacting kk modes and the massless matter multiplets .",
    "until the temperature drops below the first kk level , the evolution of the universe is therefore governed by the kk modes , whose contribution to the entropy is continually decreasing as the temperature drops . during this period",
    "there is production of massive gravitons and gravitinos which can only decay to the massless ( twisted ) particles since their decays to the ( untwisted ) kk modes is kinematically suppressed .",
    "the effect of the decaying particles on the abundances of the light elements then imposes a severe bound on @xmath1272 ( abel and sarkar 1995 ) . for ( hadronic ) decays occuring before the begining of nucleosynthesis , the requirement that @xmath442 not be increased above @xmath616 translates into the bound @xmath1428 while for later decays , consideration of @xmath1429h photofission imposes an even stricter bound .",
    "however the reheat temperature expected in these models is expected to be significantly larger than the usual value , viz .",
    "@xmath1430 for an inflaton mass @xmath1431 as is required to reproduce the measurement of cmb fluctuations .",
    "a possible solution would appear to be a second phase of inflation with @xmath1432 to dilute the kk states but the reheat temperature is then of @xmath1433 i.e. too low for nucleosynthesis to occur .",
    "thus it appears to be difficult to construct a consistent cosmological history for four - dimensional superstring models with tree - level supersymmetry breaking , notwithstanding their many theoretical attractions .",
    "phase transitions associated with the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry in the early universe can create stable topological defects in the associated higgs field , viz .",
    "domain walls , strings and monopoles ( kibble 1976 , see vilenkin and shellard 1994 ) .",
    "stable domain walls are cosmologically unacceptable , as we have seen earlier (  [ nmssm ] ) , and so are monopoles , which are neccessarily created during gut symmetry breaking ( see preskill 1984 ) . such monopoles would be expected to have a relic abundance comparable to that of baryons , but are @xmath1434 times heavier , so would clearly lead to cosmological disaster .",
    "further , direct searches have failed to find any monopoles ( see particle data group 1996 ) .",
    "the most attractive mechanism for getting rid of then is to invoke an inflationary phase , with reheating to a temperature well below the gut scale , as is also required independently from consideration of the gravitino problem (  [ gravprob ] ) .",
    "by contrast , cosmic strings have an acceptably small relic energy density and have been studied in great detail because they provide an alternative to inflationary scalar field fluctuations as the source of the perturbations which seed the growth of large - scale structure ( see brandenberger 1991 , 1994 ) . detailed numerical studies ( e.g. albrecht and stebbins 1992 ) find that this requires the string tension @xmath1334 to be in the range @xmath1435 interestingly close to the gut scale , and in agreement with the value @xmath1436 obtained ( coulson 1994 , see also bennett 1992 ) by normalizing the associated cmb fluctuations to the data .",
    "an interesting constraint on such gut scale strings follows from big bang nucleosynthesis ( e.g. hogan and rees 1984 , brandenberger 1986 , bennett 1986 , quirs 1991 ) .",
    "the evolving network of cosmic strings generates gravitational radiation which contributes to the total relativistic energy density , thus the bound on the speed - up rate translates into an upper bound on the string tension . from a detailed numerical study ,",
    "caldwell and allen ( 1992 ) find that the bound @xmath1437 implies @xmath1438 these authors illustrate how the bound is weakened if one adopts a more conservative bound , e.g. @xmath1439 implies @xmath1440 .",
    "in general , consideration of the effect of the gravitational wave background on pulsar timing observations gives more stringent bounds ( see hindmarsh and kibble 1995 ) but these too are consistent with the value required for structure formation .",
    "it has been noted that cosmic strings are likely to be superconducting so that large currents can be induced in them by a primordial magnetic field ( witten 1985a ) .",
    "in addition to gravitational waves , such a string also radiates electromagnetic radiation at an ever - increasing rate as its motion is damped thus increasing the current .",
    "thus the end point is expected to be the catastrophic release of the entire energy content into high energy particles ; such explosions will send shock waves into the surrounding intergalactic medium and galaxy formation may take place in the dense shells of swept - up matter ( ostriker , thomson and witten 1986 ) .",
    "however this is constrained by the stringent bounds on such energy release during the nucleosynthesis era ( hodges and turner 1988 , sigl 1995 ) and the idea is essentially ruled out by other constraints from the thermalization of the blackbody background ( e.g. wright 1994 )",
    ".      there have been other applications of bbn constraints to hypothetical particles which do not fit into the categories considered above . for example bounds on scalars and pseudo - scalars ( e.g. bertolini and steigman 1992 )",
    "have been applied to hadronic axions ( chang and choi 1993 ) , to a particle which couples to two photons but not to leptons or quarks ( mass and toldr 1994b ) and to majoron emission in @xmath1441-decay ( chang and choi 1994 ) .",
    "bounds have been derived on ` shadow matter ' in superstring theories ( kolb 1985 , krauss 1986 ) , on the time - evolution of possible new dimensions ( kolb 1986a , barrow 1987 ) and on ` mirror fermions ' ( e.g. fargion and roos 1984 , senjanovi 1986 , berezhiani and mohapatra 1995 , foot and volkas 1995b ) . carlson and glashow ( 1987 ) have ruled out a suggested solution to the orthopositronium decay puzzle involving ` milli - charged ' particles ( also discussed by davidson and peskin 1994 ) while escribano ( 1995 ) have ruled out another solution involving exotic particle emission . for lack of space , we do not discuss these results except to caution that many of them assume an overly restrictive limit on @xmath272 and should be suitably rescaled to the conservative bound .",
    "the nature of the dark matter which is observed to dominate the dynamics of individual galaxies as well as groups and clusters of galaxies ( see faber and gallagher 1979 , trimble 1987 , ashman 1992 ) is one of the key problems at the interface of particle physics and cosmology",
    ". it may just be ordinary matter in some non - luminous form , e.g. planets , white dwarfs , black holes ( see lynden - bell and gilmore 1990 , carr 1994 ) .",
    "however the bbn bound on the abundance of nucleons in _ any _ form constrains this possibility and implies that most of the dark matter is in fact non - nucleonic .",
    "the usually quoted bbn value of @xmath1442 is significantly higher than the value obtained from direct observations of luminous matter , as shown in .",
    "this suggests that most nucleons are dark and , in particular , that much of the dark matter in galactic halos , which contribute @xmath1443 ( see binney and tremaine 1987 ) , may be nucleonic .",
    "however if the indications of a high primordial @xmath312 abundance ( songaila 1994 , rugers and hogan 1996a , b ) are correct , then the implied lower value of @xmath1444 is close to its observational lower limit ( for high values of @xmath82 ) , leaving little room for nucleonic dark matter .",
    "conversely , if the primordial @xmath312 abundance is as low as found by tytler 1996 , the corresponding value of @xmath1445 would suggest that much of the halo dark matter is nucleonic .",
    "either possibility is consistent with searches to date for gravitational microlensing events expected ( paczyski 1986 ) for a halo dominated by dark compact objects .",
    "the 8 candidate events detected by the _",
    "macho _ collaboration imply that about half of the halo mass can be in the form of such objects having a most probable mass of @xmath1446 ( alcock 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "even more interesting is the comparison with clusters of galaxies which clearly have a large nucleonic content , particularly in the form of x - ray emitting intracluster gas .",
    "white ( 1993 ) have reviewed the data on the well - studied _ coma _ cluster , for which they find the nucleonic mass fraction @xmath1447 where the first term corresponds to the luminous matter in the cluster galaxies ( within the abell radius , @xmath1448 mpc ) and the second to the intracluster x - ray emitting gas . using results from hydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation",
    "these authors show that cooling and other dissipative effects could have enhanced @xmath1449 within @xmath1450 by a factor of at most @xmath1451 over the global average",
    ". similarly large nucleonic fractions ( between @xmath27 and 22@xmath1452 ) have also been found in a sample of 13 other clusters ( white and fabian 1995 ) .",
    "if such structures are indeed fair tracers of the universal mass distribution , then @xmath1449 is related to the global density parameters as @xmath1453 thus for @xmath116 as expected from inflation , the _ coma _ observations can be consistent with standard bbn only for a low deuterium abundance ( and low values of @xmath82 ) as shown in .",
    "observations of large - scale structure and cmb anisotropy do favour high @xmath414 and low @xmath82 for a critical density universe dominated by cold dark matter ( e.g. white 1996 , adams 1996 ) .",
    "conversely if the deuterium abundance is indeed high , then to achieve consistency would require @xmath1454 ( for which there is , admittedly , independent observational evidence ; see e.g. coles and ellis 1994 ) .",
    "the dark matter in _ coma _ and other clusters would then be comparable to that in the individual galactic halos .",
    "it is presently controversial whether this is indeed evidence for @xmath115 or whether the nucleonic enhancement factor @xmath1455 and/or the total cluster mass have been underestimated ; also there may be sources of non - thermal pressure in clusters ( viz .",
    "magnetic fields , cosmic rays ) which would lower the inferred pressure of the x - ray emitting plasma , hence the value of @xmath1449 ( see felten and steigman 1995 ) .    in principle there may exist baryonic matter which does not participate in nuclear reactions and is utherefore unconstrained by the above arguments .",
    "two examples are planetary mass black holes ( crawford and schramm 1982 , hall and hsu 1990 ) and strange quark nuggets ( witten 1984 , see alcock and olinto 1988 ) which , it has been speculated , can be formed in cosmologically interesting amounts during a strongly first - order quark - hadron phase transition . as discussed earlier (  [ inhombbn ] ) , the fluctuations induced by such a violent phase transition should have resulted in the synthesis of observable ( although rather uncertain ) amounts of heavy elements ( see malaney and mathews 1993 ) .",
    "also , according to our present theoretical understanding , this phase transition is relatively smooth ( see bonometto and pantano 1993 , smilga 1995 ) .      given that the dark matter , at least in galactic halos , is unlikely to be baryonic , it is interesting to consider whether it may be composed of relic particles .",
    "this is well motivated ( see hall 1988 , sarkar 1991 , ellis 1994 ) since extensions of the standard model often contain new massive particles which are stable due to some new conserved quantum number . alternatively ,",
    "known particles which are cosmologically abundant , i.e. neutrinos , can constitute the dark matter if they acquire a small mass , e.g. through violation of global lepton number .",
    "thus there are many particle candidates for the dark matter corresponding to many possible extensions of the sm ( see srednicki 1990 ) . in order to optimize experimental strategies for their detection ( see primack 1988 , smith and lewin 1990 ) , it is important to narrow the field and it is here that constraints from cosmological nucleosynthesis play an important role .",
    "it is generally assumed that dark matter particles must be weakly interacting since dark matter halos appear to be non - dissipative .",
    "however since there is as yet no ` standard ' model of galaxy formation ( see white 1994 ) , it is legitimate to ask whether dark matter particles may have electromagnetic or strong interactions , given that their interaction lifetime exceeds the age of the galaxy due to the low density of interstellar space ( goldberg and hall 1986 ) .",
    "this possibility has been studied in detail and various constraints identified ( de rjula , glashow and sarid 1990 , dimopoulos 1990 , chivukula 1990 ) . according to the standard relic abundance calculation ,",
    "such particles would have survived freeze - out with a _ minimum _",
    "relic abundance of @xmath1456 per nucleon ( dover 1979 , wolfram 1979 ) .",
    "these would have then bound with ordinary nuclei during nucleosynthesis , creating anomalously heavy isotopes of the light elements ( dicus and teplitz 1980 , cahn and glashow 1981 ) .",
    "sensitive searches for such isotopes have been carried out in a variety of terrestrial sites , all with negative results ( see rich 1987 , smith 1988 ) .",
    "the best limits on the concentration of such particles are @xmath1457 per nucleon in the mass range @xmath1458 ( smith 1982 ) , @xmath1459 per nucleon in the mass range @xmath1460 ( hemmick 1990 ) and @xmath1461 in the mass range @xmath1462 ( verkerk 1992 ) .",
    "thus it is reasonable to infer that dark matter particles are electrically neutral and weakly interacting .",
    "times greater than their freeze - out abundance . ]",
    "apart from the above general constraint , bbn would not appear to be relevant to individual particle candidates for the dark matter , since by definition their energy density is negligible relative to that of radiation during nucleosynthesis and furthermore , they are required to be stable or at least very long - lived .",
    "nevertheless , bbn does provide another important constraint since it implies that the comoving entropy can not have changed significantly ( barring very exotic possibilities ) since the mev era .",
    "thus the relic abundance of , for example , a ` cold dark matter ' particle is unlikely to have been much altered from its value at freeze - out , which we can rewrite as @xmath1463 thus it would be natural for a massive particle to constitute the dark matter if it is weakly interacting , i.e. if its interactions are fixed by physics above the fermi scale .",
    "this is arguably the most direct hint we have today for an intimate connection between particle physics and cosmology , beyond their respective standard models .",
    "in the words of yab zeldovich , cosmology has long provided the `` poor man s accelerator '' for particle physics .",
    "as terrestrial accelerators come closer to the ultimate limits of technology and resources , it is imperative that our understanding of the cosmological laboratory be developed further , in particular since it offers probes of phenomena which can _ never _ be recreated in laboratories on earth , however powerful our machines become .",
    "( this is not just to do with the energies available but because the early universe provides an _ equilibrium _ thermal environment , in contrast to the non - equilibrium environment of particle collisions in an accelerator . )",
    "there is an understandable reluctance , at least among experimentalists , to treat cosmological constraints on the same footing as as the results of repeatable and controlled laboratory experiments .",
    "however many theorists are already guided almost exclusively by cosmological considerations since there is simply no other experimental data available at the energies they are interested in .",
    "we therefore close with the following plea concerning the improvement of constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis .    in the comparison of the abundance data with the theoretical expectations ,",
    "we have noted the rather unsatisfactory state of the observational situation today . whereas there has been some concerted effort in recent years towards precise abundance determinations ,",
    "the quoted numbers are still plagued by uncertain systematic errors and workers in this field use rather subjective criteria , e.g. `` reasonable '' and `` sensible '' , to determine abundance bounds . in this regard , a comparison with the experimental style in high energy physics is illuminating .",
    "thousands of person - years of effort have been invested in obtaining the precise parameters of the @xmath1464 resonance in @xmath926 collisions , which measures the number of light neutrino species ( and other particles ) which couple to the @xmath1464 . in comparison ,",
    "relatively little work has been done by a few small teams on measuring the primordial light element abundances , which provide a complementary check of this number as well as a probe of new superweakly interacting particles which do not couple to the @xmath1464 . in our view , such measurements ought to constitute a _ key _",
    "programme for cosmology , with the same priority as , say , the measurement of the hubble constant or of the cosmological density parameter .",
    "our understanding of the @xmath0 cosmic microwave background has been revolutionized by the accurate and consistent database provided by the mission .",
    "a similar revolution is overdue for primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "i am indebted to many colleagues with whom i have enjoyed discussions and collaborations on cosmological constraints , in particular steven abel , jeremy bernstein , ramanath cowsik , john ellis , kari enqvist , graciela gelmini , peter kernan , roger phillips , graham ross , dennis sciama and david seckel .",
