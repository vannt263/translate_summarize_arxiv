    "despite the tremendously successful consolidation of the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics by experimental precision tests during the past few years , the structure of the higgs sector has essentially remained unexplored , so that there is still plenty of room for extensions .",
    "a phenomenologically interesting extension of the sm higgs sector that keeps the electroweak @xmath11 parameter @xcite at unity in the born approximation , is obtained by adding a second complex isospin - doublet scalar field with opposite hypercharge .",
    "this leads to the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) .",
    "after the three massless goldstone bosons which emerge via the electroweak symmetry breaking are eaten up to become the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bosons , there remain five physical higgs scalars : the neutral cp - even @xmath14 and @xmath15 bosons , the neutral cp - odd @xmath1 boson , and the charged @xmath16-boson pair .",
    "the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) consists of such a 2hdm . at tree level , the mssm higgs sector has two free parameters , which are usually taken to be the mass @xmath17 of the @xmath1 boson and the ratio @xmath18 of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets . for large values of @xmath19 ,",
    "the top yukawa couplings of the neutral higgs bosons , @xmath20 , are suppressed compared to the bottom ones .",
    "the search for higgs bosons and the study of their properties are among the prime objectives of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , a proton - proton colliding - beam facility with centre - of - mass energy @xmath21  gev , which is presently under construction at cern .",
    "the dominant production mechanisms for the neutral higgs bosons at the lhc will be gluon fusion , @xmath22 @xcite , and @xmath23 associated production , @xmath24 @xcite , which is , however , only relevant for large @xmath19 .",
    "the loop - induced @xmath25 couplings @xcite are mainly mediated by virtual top quarks , unless @xmath19 is very large , in which case the bottom - quark loops take over .",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 couplings also receive contributions from squark loops , which are , however , insignificant for squark masses in excess of about 500  gev @xcite . in the case of the @xmath7 coupling , such contributions do not occur at one loop because the @xmath1 boson has no tree - level couplings to squarks . for small @xmath19 , the inclusive cross sections of @xmath28 via gluon fusion",
    "are significantly increased , by typically 5070% under lhc conditions , by including their leading qcd corrections , which involve two - loop contributions @xcite .",
    "thus , the theoretical predictions for these observables can not yet be considered to be well under control , and it is desirable to compute the next - to - leading qcd corrections at three loops , since there is no reason to expect them to be negligible .",
    "recently , a first step in this direction has been taken by considering the resummation of soft - gluon radiation in @xmath28 , assuming @xmath19 to be small @xcite .",
    "considering the enormous complexity of the exact expressions for the leading qcd corrections @xcite , it becomes apparent that , with presently available technology , the next - to - leading corrections are only tractable in limiting cases .",
    "for instance , in the large-@xmath19 limit , where the @xmath25 couplings are chiefly generated by bottom - quark loops , one can neglect the bottom - quark mass against the higgs - boson mass , keeping the bottom yukawa coupling finite . in this way ,",
    "one resorts to massless qcd . on the other hand , if @xmath19 is close to unity , which was assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the top - quark loops play the dominant rle , and simplifications occur if the mass hierarchy @xmath29 is satisfied .",
    "then , it is useful to construct an effective lagrangian by integrating out the top quark .",
    "this effective lagrangian is a linear combination of local composite operators of mass dimension four , which act in qcd with five massless quark flavours , while all dependence on @xmath30 is contained in their coefficient functions . once the coefficient functions are known , it is sufficient to deal with massless feynman diagrams .",
    "the effective lagrangian describing the interactions of the sm higgs boson @xmath15 with gluons and light quarks was elaborated at two loops in ref .",
    "@xcite and extended to three loops in refs .",
    "@xcite . as an application , the @xmath31 @xcite and @xmath32 @xcite corrections to the @xmath33 partial decay width were calculated from this lagrangian .",
    "these results can be readily adapted to the @xmath14 and @xmath15 bosons of the 2hdm with small @xmath19 by accordingly adjusting the top yukawa coupling , which appears as an overall factor .    in this paper , we extend the three - loop analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite to include the @xmath1 boson of the 2hdm . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we work in the limit @xmath34 , so that we may treat bottom as a massless quark flavour with vanishing yukawa coupling , on the same footing as up , down , strange , and charm . specifically , we construct a heavy - top - quark effective lagrangian for the qcd interactions of the @xmath1 boson and derive from it an analytic result for the @xmath32 correction to the @xmath8 partial decay width appropriate for @xmath35 .",
    "we recover the corresponding @xmath31 result originally found in refs .",
    "@xcite and also discussed in ref .",
    "the @xmath31 correction for arbitrary values of the @xmath1-boson and quark masses was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite as a two - fold parameter integral .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the leading high-@xmath30 term of this correction may also be obtained from massless five - flavour qcd endowed with a heavy - top - quark effective @xmath7 coupling @xcite .",
    "a central ingredient for this check was the observation that the effective @xmath7 coupling does not receive qcd corrections , at least at @xmath31 .",
    "this fact was interpreted @xcite as being a consequence of the adler - bardeen theorem @xcite , which states that the anomaly of the axial - vector current @xcite is not renormalized in qcd .",
    "this theorem is strictly proven to all orders in @xmath36 for the abelian case @xcite , and strong arguments suggest that it also holds true for the nonabelian case @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we verify by an explicit diagrammatic calculation that the @xmath31 and @xmath32 corrections to the coefficient function of the operator @xmath37 , which generates the @xmath1-boson effective couplings to gluons vanish .. ] we also present the leading - order coefficient function of the physical operator pertaining to the effective @xmath38 interaction , where @xmath39 is a light quark . we thus provide the tools which are necessary to reduce the calculation of the next - to - leading qcd correction to the cross section of @xmath40 to a standard problem in massless five - flavour qcd .    in our analysis",
    ", we consistently neglect the yukawa couplings of the light quarks to the @xmath1 boson . in other words",
    ", if all quark masses , except for @xmath30 , are nullified , the hadronic decay width of the @xmath1 boson is entirely due to @xmath8 and the associated higher - order processes under consideration here . through three loops , the contributing final states are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : two ] , we establish the heavy - top - quark effective lagrangian for the qcd interactions of the @xmath1 boson to three loops . in section  [ sec : three ] , we compute from this lagrangian the @xmath32 correction to the partial width of the decay @xmath8 and compare it with predictions based on various scale - optimization methods . section  [ sec : four ] contains a discussion of our results together with some remarks on the connection between the effective @xmath7 coupling , the axial - anomaly equation , and the low - energy theorem .",
    "we start by setting up the theoretical framework for our analysis . as usual , we employ dimensional regularization in @xmath48 space - time dimensions and introduce a t  hooft mass , @xmath49 , to keep the coupling constants dimensionless @xcite .",
    "we perform the renormalization according to the modified @xcite minimal - subtraction @xcite ( @xmath3 ) scheme . for the sake of generality , we take the qcd gauge group to be su(@xmath50 ) , with @xmath50 arbitrary .",

    "as already mentioned in the introduction , we consider a 2hdm with @xmath60 , so that the quark yukawa couplings and masses are related by a flavour - independent proportionality factor .",
    "the starting point of our consideration is the bare yukawa lagrangian for the interactions of the @xmath1 boson with the quarks in the full @xmath61-flavour theory , @xmath62 where @xmath63 , with @xmath64 being fermi s constant . taking the limit @xmath65 and keeping only leading terms , eq .",
