    "top - pair events are often accompanied by additional hard jets that do not originate from the decay of the top pair ( @xmath0+jets ) at the lhc .",
    "these events provide an essential handle to test higher - order qcd calculations of processes leading to multijet events but also to test the choice of renormalisation and factorisation scales for data modeling .",
    "the correct description of @xmath0+jets production is crucial for the overall lhc physics program since it constitutes an important background for processes of interest with multijet final states .",
    "typical processes are the associated higgs - boson production with a @xmath0 pair , where the higgs boson decays into jets , or final states predicted in supersymmetric theories .",
    "anomalous production of additional jets accompanying a @xmath0 pair could be a sign of new physics beyond the standard model . + using 5.0 fb@xmath1 of proton - proton collisions at 7 tev recorded in 2011 by the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) detector , the @xmath0 cross section is measured differentially as a function of the total number of jets in the event ( in the dilepton and @xmath2+jets channels ) , and as a function of the number of additional jets in the event ( in the @xmath2+jets channel ) .",
    "the fraction of events that do not contain additional jets ( gap fraction ) , is determined as a function of the threshold on the transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) of the leading additional jet ( in the dilepton channel ) .",
    "a complete documentation of this analysis and all the corresponding references can be found in  @xcite .",
    "events in the dilepton channel are required to contain at least two isolated leptons ( electrons or muons ) of opposite charge and at least two jets , of which at least one is identified as a b - jet . a cut applied on events with a small lepton - pair invariant mass suppresses background from heavy - flavour resonance decays . in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels , the dilepton invariant mass is required to be outside a z - boson mass window , and a cut on the missing transverse energy ( met ) is applied . finally a kinematic reconstruction method is used to identify the two b - jets originating from the decay of the top quark and antiquark .",
    "those events which do not provide a valid reconstruction are rejected .",
    "+ in the @xmath2+jets channel ( @xmath6 ) , events are retained if they contain exactly one isolated lepton .",
    "a veto against additional leptons is applied to reject events in the dilepton decay channel .",
    "the presence of at least three reconstructed jets is required and at least two of them must be b - tagged . + a particle - level selection defines the phase space of the results .",
    "this selection is solely based on simulated particles before applying the detector simulation .",
    "the kinematic requirements for the charged lepton(s ) originating from the @xmath0 decay and for the jets are similar to those at the detector - level .",
    "jets are identified as originating from b - quarks if they contain the decay products of a b hadron .",
    "the signal is simulated by madgraph ( v.5.1.1.0 ) interfaced with pythia ( v.6.424 ) , with @xmath0 + 0/1/2/3-jets processes being generated at matrix - element level .",
    "data - driven techniques are used for the modelling of @xmath7+jets in the dilepton channel and @xmath8+jets and qcd multijet in the @xmath2+jets channel .",
    "the remaining backgrounds are estimated by mc simulation .",
    "+ in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels , the normalisation of the @xmath9+jets production is derived from the data events rejected by the z - boson veto , scaled by the ratio of events failing and passing this selection estimated in simulation . + in the @xmath2+jets",
    "channel a qcd - multijet model is extracted from data by selecting non - isolated leptons .",
    "the normalisation is estimated with a template fit of met using events with one b - tagged jet .",
    "the normalisation of the @xmath8+jets simulation in the @xmath2+jets channel is corrected , making use of the charge - asymmetrical @xmath8-boson production in pp collisions .",
    "in addition , the differences between data and simulation observed in the heavy - flavour content are corrected in the @xmath8+jets simulation .",
    "after the full selection and the subtraction of background contributions , the jet multiplicity spectrum in data is unfolded by means of a regularised single - value - decomposition method  @xcite , in order to correct for detector - induced migration effects .",
    "this step provides results within the particle - level phase space .",
    "the unfolded spectrum is normalised by the measured cross section , in order to eliminate uncertainties stemming from normalisation effects , which leads to the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsecjet ] .",
    "+ additionally , the normalised differential cross section of @xmath0 production as a function of the number of additional jets is measured in the @xmath2+jets channel , requiring @xmath10 4 jets .",
    "additional jets are defined as particle - level jets which do not match the direction of any of the @xmath0 decay partons ( the two light jets and the lepton from the @xmath8-boson decays and the two b - jets from the top decays ) .",
    "simulated @xmath0 events are categorised in @xmath0 + 0 , 1 , and @xmath102 additional jets depending on how many non - matching particle - level jets have been identified .",
    "a template fit is performed in order to extract the differential cross sections for @xmath0 + 0 , 1 , and @xmath102 additional jets categories from data .",
    "finally the resulting cross sections are normalised and given in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsecjet ] .",
    "the main systematic uncertainties are due to uncertainties on the jet energy and the signal modeling .",
    "+ both differential cross - section measurements lead to similar conclusions : the predictions from madgraph+pythia and powheg+pythia are found to provide a reasonable description of the data . in contrast , mc@nlo+herwig generates fewer events in bins with large jet multiplicities .",
    "the comparison of the measurements with predictions from madgraph+pythia with variation of the renormalisation and factorisation scales and of the jet - parton matching threshold shows for both parameters a worse agreement when a lower value is chosen .",
    "the jet activity arising from quark and gluon radiation in association with the @xmath0 system is investigated with the fraction of events that do not contain additional jets above a given @xmath3 threshold in the dilepton decay channel .",
    "the additional jets are defined as those not assigned to the @xmath0 system by the kinematic reconstruction . a bin - by - bin correction for detector effects",
    "is applied on the calculated gap fraction values .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : gap_dilep ] .",
    "the main systematic uncertainties originate from the jet - energy uncertainty and the background contaminations . a better agreement between data and simulation",
    "is observed for mc@nlo+herwig compared to madgraph+pythia and powheg+pythia .",
    "this result is not incompatible with the observation described in the previous section because the gap fraction tests the description of the @xmath3 spectrum of the hardest additional jet which does not imply a good description of the larger jet multiplicity .",
    "decreasing the renormalisation and factorisation scales or the jet - parton matching threshold in the madgraph sample worsens the agreement between data and simulation .",
    "measurements of differential cross sections with respect to jets accompanying @xmath0 events are performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb@xmath1 collected in pp collisions at @xmath11 tev with the cms detector .",
    "the results are presented in the visible phase space after correction for detector effects and compared with predictions from perturbative quantum chromodynamics from madgraph and powheg interfaced with pythia , and mc@nlo interfaced with herwig , as well as madgraph with varied renormalisation and factorisation scales , and jet - parton matching threshold .",
    "the normalised differential @xmath0 production cross section is measured as a function of the number of jets in the dilepton and @xmath2+jets channels and as a function of the number of jets radiated in addition to the @xmath0 decay products in the @xmath2+jets channel .",
    "the madgraph+pythia and powheg+pythia predictions describe the data well up to high jet multiplicities , while mc@nlo+herwig predicts fewer events with large number of jets .",
    "the gap fraction is measured in dilepton events as a function of the @xmath3 of the leading additional jet and is compared to different theoretical predictions .",
    "no significant deviations are observed between data and simulation .",
    "the mc@nlo+herwig model seems to describe the gap fraction for all values of the thresholds more accurately compared to madgraph+pythia and powheg+pythia . in all measurements a higher parameter value chosen for the renormalisation and factorisation scale or for the jet - parton matching threshold improves the modeling of data .",
