    "crashes and uncontrollable hikes can often occur in financial markets .",
    "such changes of the prices confuse the market and damage the economy because they start abruptly in many cases .",
    "therefore , techniques to measure the probabilistic risk of sudden change in the prices have been studied using tick - by - tick data [ 1 ] .",
    "recently , it was empirically found that change of prices can be approximated by the fokker - planck equation and the new type of random walk in a potential field [ 2,3,4,5 ] .",
    "the potential field is approximated by a quadratic function with its center given by the moving average of past market prices .",
    "this random walk model is called the potentials of unbalanced complex kinetics ( puck ) model in which the potential slowly changes in the market [ 3,4 ] . in this paper , we focus on the diffusion properties of this random walk process and calculate the diffusion coefficient which is helpful for estimating the market risk .",
    "we first review an empirical derivation of the puck model .",
    "we next show that the statistically steady condition of price fluctuations depends on the potential field , and clarify relationships between the price diffusion and the potential field .",
    "we finally demonstrate that the price diffusion in short time scales depends on the size of moving average , however , large scale diffusion properties are independent of the moving average . in the paper , we used all the bid record ( about 20 million ticks ) of the exchange rates for yen / dollar that were traded by the term from 1989 to 2002 to find the firm statistical laws .",
    "prices in financial markets always have violent fluctuation in a short time scale .",
    "we first eliminate the uncorrelated noise @xmath3 from the price @xmath4 in order to reduce the statistical error .",
    "we next investigate the dynamics of the price .",
    "we can perform this noise elimination process by introducing an optimum moving average @xmath5 :    @xmath6    @xmath7    where @xmath4 is a price , @xmath3 is an uncorrelated noise and @xmath8 gives the weight factors where the time is measured by ticks .",
    "the weight factors are calculated by using yule - walker equation [ 6,7,8 ] . in a case of yen - dollar rate",
    ", the weight factor @xmath8 follows an exponential function whose characteristic decay time is about 30 seconds [ 6 ] .",
    "we investigate a behavior of the optimum moving average @xmath5 obtained by eliminating the uncorrelated noise @xmath3 from the price @xmath4 .",
    "we introduce a super moving average @xmath9 defined by    @xmath10    in financial markets , it is found that the following relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath9 holds for a certain range of @xmath2[2 ] ,    @xmath11    where the mean of noise @xmath12 is zero .",
    "the eq.([eq4 ] ) means that the price change can be approximated by a random walk in a quadratic potential field whose center is given by the moving average of past prices .",
    "it is known that the potential coefficient @xmath13 has a long autocorrelation [ 3,4 ] .",
    "we focus on eq.([eq4 ] ) with the case of a constant @xmath1 because the coefficient @xmath13 is known to change slowly in financial markets .",
    "eq.([eq4 ] ) is transformed as follows ,    @xmath14    this is a type of ar process for price difference when @xmath1 is a constant .",
    "we can estimate the conditions of @xmath1 to make the ar process being statistically steady .",
    "eq.([eq5 ] ) is transformed by the following determinant ,    @xmath15    where    @xmath16    if @xmath17 , the time series of @xmath18 is in a weakly steady state because @xmath19 becomes independent of the initial value of @xmath20 .",
    "this condition is fulfilled when the absolute values of all eigenvalues of @xmath21 are less than 1 .",
    "for example , when @xmath22 the time series of @xmath23 is statistically steady if the potential coefficient satisfies @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath25 the eigenvalues of @xmath21 are given by    @xmath26    solving the steady state condition we find that the potential coefficient should be in the range of @xmath27 for @xmath25 . numerically calculating the eigenvalues for @xmath28",
    "as shown in fig.1 we find that the time series of @xmath18 is statistically stationary if the potential coefficient is in the following range ,    @xmath29    outside the condition of eq.([eq9 ] ) , the range of price fluctuations increases indefinitely depending on the time @xmath30 .",
    "as the potential coefficient @xmath13 has a long autocorrelation , we can calculate the future price diffusion using eq.([eq4 ] ) . this prediction is crucial in order to evaluate the risks of market .",
    "we clarify statistical laws of price diffusion described by eq.([eq4 ] ) using both simulations and theoretical analysis .    by simulating eq.([eq4 ] ) for the case of @xmath13 is a constant , we investigate the standard deviation on a time scale @xmath31 defined by     @xmath32    in fig.2 we plot @xmath33 for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 when @xmath38 and @xmath39 . here , @xmath12 is the gaussian random number whose standard deviation is 1 .",
    "the time scale where the hurst exponent converges 0.5 depends on @xmath2 .",
    "for example , the time scale is about @xmath40 when @xmath41 , while the time scale is around @xmath42 when @xmath34    we can estimate the standard deviation @xmath33 in the long time scale limit .",
    "the variance of change of optimum moving average price @xmath5 is given by     @xmath43    by introducing a rough approximation    @xmath44    we have the following simple formulation after some calculation ,    @xmath45    where @xmath46 , @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the standard deviation when @xmath50 . in this long time scales , the standard deviation of the price",
    "is amplified @xmath0 times by the potential field . in fig.3",
    "we show relationships between the potential coefficient @xmath1 and the ratio of standard deviation @xmath51 when @xmath52 by simulating eq.([eq4 ] ) for @xmath22 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 .",
    "we can confirm that the price diffusion of numerical simulations follows eq.([eq13 ] ) independent of @xmath2 in the long time scale . from eq.([eq13 ] ) we can theoretically find that in the long time scales the price diffusion is independent of @xmath2 , independent of @xmath1 , @xmath53 .",
    "from dataset of real market prices , we can estimate the value of @xmath1 , and presume the best value of @xmath2 by comparing the price diffusion of numerical simulations to real price diffusion .",
    "fig.4 shows the diffusions of yen - dollar rates from 3:35 to 8:35 and from 9:25 to 23:25 in 11/9/2001 , the day of terrorism .",
    "the rates were stable till 8:35 and it became quite unstable after 9:25 .",
    "the rates until 8:35 follow a slow diffusion in short time scales , namely , the market has an attractive potential @xmath54 . as shown in fig.4",
    ", we can recreate the rate diffusion in all time scales by simulating eq.([eq4 ] ) with @xmath55 and @xmath56 ticks .",
    "we next focus on the unstable rates after 9:25 that follow a fast diffusion in short time scales .",
    "when @xmath57 and @xmath56 ticks , the price diffusion of numerical simulation is also consistent with the rate diffusion .",
    "the price diffusion depends on @xmath2 in the short time scales , although the price diffusion is independents of @xmath2 in the long time scales .",
    "therefore , if @xmath58 ticks , there are gaps between the price diffusion of numerical simulations and the rate diffusion in the short time scales as shown in fig.4 . in other real markets",
    ", we can also estimate the best value of @xmath2 from such characteristics of price diffusion .",
    "we can approximate the change of market prices by the random walk in a potential field .",
    "the potential field is well approximated by a quadratic function with its center given by the moving average of past prices .",
    "the random walk process is called the puck model . by analyzing the model",
    ", we clarified that the statistically steady condition of price fluctuations depends on the potential coefficient @xmath1 , and we also theoretically proved that the price diffusion in the long time scales is amplified @xmath59 times , independent of the size @xmath2 of super moving average . in short time",
    "scales the price diffusion depends on @xmath2 .",
    "we can estimate the best value of @xmath2 in real financial markets by observing this dependence .",
    "we recreated the diffusion of yen - dollar rates in all time scales by the puck model .",
