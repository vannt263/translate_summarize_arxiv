    "one of the most exciting consequence of models of low scale gravity @xcite is the possibility of production of small black holes @xcite at particle colliders such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) as well as in ultrahigh energy cosmic ray air showers ( uecras ) @xcite .",
    "incorporation of gravity in quantum field theory support the idea that the standard heisenberg uncertainty principle should be reformulated by the so - called generalized uncertainty principle near the planck scale @xcite . in particular , the existence of a minimum observable length is indicated by string theory @xcite , tev - scale black hole physics @xcite , and loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "moreover , some black hole gedanken experiments support the idea of existence of a minimal measurable length in a fascinating manner @xcite on the other hand , doubly special relativity theories @xcite suggest that , a test particle s momentum can not be arbitrarily imprecise and there is an upper bound , , for momentum fluctuation .",
    "it means that there is also a maximal particle momentum .",
    "it has been shown that incorporation of quantum gravity effects in black hole physics and thermodynamics through a generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) with the mentioned natural cutoffs modifies the result dramatically , specially , the final stage of black hole evaporation .",
    "parikh and wilczek on their pioneering work @xcite constructed a procedure to describe the hawking radiation emitted from a schwarzschild black hole as a tunneling through its quantum horizon .",
    "the emission rate ( tunneling probability ) which arising from the reduction of the black hole mass , is related to the change of black hole entropies before and after the emission . in this article ,",
    "charged particle s tunneling from charged non - rotating micro black hole is investigated .",
    "we consider a more general framework of gup that admits a minimal length , minimal momentum , and maximal momentum to study the effects of natural cutoffs on the tunneling mechanism and luminosity of charged non - rotating tev - scale black holes with extra dimensions in arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) model @xcite in the context of this gup .",
    "the calculation shows that , the emission rate satisfies the first law of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce a generalized uncertainty principle with minimal length , minimal momentum , and maximal momentum . in section 3",
    ", we obtain an expression for emission rate of charged particle from charged non - rotating micro black hole based on the add model and the mentioned gup .",
    "we consider the back scattering of the emitted radiation taking into account energy and charge conservation to evaluate the luminosity of tev - scale black hole in presence of natural cutoffs .",
    "the last part is the discussion and calculation .",
    "the existence of a minimal measurable length of the order of the planck length , @xmath0 was indicated by most of quantum gravity approaches @xcite which modifies the heisenberg uncertainty principle ( hup ) to the so - called generalized ( gravitational ) uncertainty principle ( gup ) .",
    "the minimal position uncertainty,@xmath1 , could be not made arbitrarily small toward zero @xcite in the gup framework due to its essential restriction on the measurement precision of the particle s position .",
    "on the other hand , doubly special relativity ( dsr ) theories @xcite has been considered that existence of a minimal measurable length would restrict a test particle s momentum to take arbitrary values and therefore there is an upper bound for momentum fluctuation @xcite .",
    "so , there is a maximal particle s momentum due to the fundamental structure of spacetime at the planck scale @xcite . based on the above arguments , the gup that predicts both a minimal length and a maximal momentum can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath2\\ ] ] the relation ( 1 ) can lead us to the following commutator relation : @xmath3 = i\\hbar \\left ( { 1 - \\alpha p + 2{\\alpha ^2}{p^2 } } \\right)\\\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is gup dimensionless positive constant of both minimal length and maximal momentum that depends on the details of the quantum gravity hypothesis .",
    "it has developed that particle s momentum can not be zero if the curvature of spacetime becomes important and uts effects are taken into account @xcite .",
    "in fact , there appears a limit to the precision which the corresponding momentum can be expressed as a nonzero minimal uncertainty in momentum measurement . based on this more general framework as a consequence of small correction to the canonical commutation relation ,",
    "this gup can be represented as @xcite @xmath5 which in extra dimensions can be written as follows @xcite @xmath6 here , @xmath4 and @xmath7 are dimensionless positive coefficients which are independent of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in general",
    "they may depend on expectation value of x and p. according to the generalized heisenberg algebra , we suppose that operators of position and momentum obey the following commutation relation : @xmath10 = i\\hbar \\left ( { 1 - \\alpha p + { \\alpha ^2}{p^2 } + { \\beta ^2}{x^2 } } \\right)\\\\ ] ] in what follows , we use this more general framework of gup to find the tunneling rate of emitted particles through charged non - rotating tev - scale black holes .",
    "the idea of large extra dimensions might allow studying interactions at trans - planckian energies in particle colliders and the add model used d new large space - like dimensions .",
    "so , in order to investigate the hawking radiation via tunneling from charged non- rotating tev - scale black holes of higher dimensional , a natural candidate is that of reissner - nordstrom d - dimensional modified solution in presence of generalized uncertainty principle @xcite . in this case , the line element of d - dimensional reissner - nordstrom solution of einstein field equation is given by @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the metric of the unit @xmath13 as @xmath14 , and @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mass and electric charge of the black hole , respectively , units @xmath19 are adopted throughout this manuscript .",
    "the black hole has an outer / inner horizon located at @xmath20\\ ] ] therefore , the event horizon shrinks , and the inner one appears , when the black hole becomes charged the inner radius is related to the amount of charge and the outer one @xmath21 corresponds to the radius of schwarzschild black hole . in this case ,",
    "equation ( 8) can be rewritten as follows @xmath22 } \\right)^{\\frac{1}{{d - 3}}}}\\ ] ] in order to apply the semi- classical tunneling analysis , one can find a proper coordinate system for the black hole metric where all the constant lines are flat and the tunneling path is free of singularities . in this manner ,",
    "painleve coordinates are suitable choices . in these coordinates ,",
    "the d - dimensional reissner - nordstrom metric is given by @xmath23 which is stationary , non - static , and non - singular at the horizon and plus ( minus ) sign corresponds to the space - time line element of the outgoing ( incoming ) particles across the event horizon , respectively .",
    "the trajectory of charged massive particles as a sort of de broglie s - wave can be approximately determined as @xcite @xmath24 where the plus ( minus ) sign denotes the radial geodesics of the outgoing ( incoming ) charged particles tunneling across the event horizon , respectively .",
    "we incorporate quantum gravity effects in the presence of the minimal length , minimal momentum , and maximal momentum via the gup which motivates modification of the standard dispersion relation in the presence of extra dimensions based on add model . if the gup is a fundamental outcome of quantum gravity proposal , it should appear that the de broglie relation is as follows @xcite @xmath25 one can find easily that positive sign does not recover ordinary relation in the limit @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "so , we consider the minus sign as @xmath28 or equivalently @xmath29 here , for investigating hawking radiation of charged massive particles from the event horizon of charged non - rotating micro black hole , we use this more general uncertainty principle and take into consideration the response of background geometry to radiated quantum of energy e with gup correction , i.e. @xmath30 . the emitted particle which can be treated as a shell of energy @xmath30 and charge q , moves on the geodesics of a space - time with central mass @xmath31 substituted for m and charge parameter @xmath32 replaced with @xmath18 .",
    "we set the total arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass , m , and the adm charge of the space - time to be fixed but allow the hole mass and charge to fluctuate and replace m by @xmath31 and @xmath18 by @xmath33 both in the metric and the geodesic equation .",
    "so , the outgoing radial geodesics of the charged massive particle tunneling out from the event horizon and the non - zero component of electromagnetic potential are , @xmath34 and , @xmath35 so , the lagrangian for the matter - gravity system is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the lagrangian function of the electromagnetic field corresponding to the generalized coordinates @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "+ we assume the tunneling mechanism as a semi - classical method producing hawking radiation . in this case",
    ", using wkb approximation , the emission rate of tunneling massive charged particle can be obtained from the imaginary part of the particle action at the stationary phase for the tunneling trajectory , namely @xcite @xmath39 assuming the generalized coordinate @xmath40 is an ignorable one , to eliminate this degree of freedom completely , we can obtain the action of the matter - gravity system as @xmath41 } \\frac{{dr}}{{\\dot r}}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the location of the event horizon corresponding @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively before and after the particle of energy @xmath30 and charge @xmath46 tunnels out , in which @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the canonical momentum conjugate to the coordinates @xmath40 , and r , respectively .",
    "+ in order to consider the effect of quantum gravity , the commutation relation between the radial coordinate components and conjugate momentums should be modified based on eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath49 ( 2 ) of the expressed gup as follows @xcite @xmath50 = i\\left ( { 1 - \\alpha { l_p}{p_r } + { \\alpha ^2}l_p^2p_r^2 } \\right)\\ ] ] so , as it is clear from the more general gup and based on eq . ( 5 ) the commutation relation should be modified as @xmath51 = i\\left ( { 1 - \\alpha { l_p}{p_r } + { \\alpha ^2}l_p^2p_r^2 + { \\beta ^2}l_p^2{r^2 } } \\right)\\ ] ] in the classical limit it is replaced by poisson bracket as follows @xmath52 now , we apply the deformed hamiltonian equation , @xmath53 and @xmath54 into eq .",
    "( 19 ) as the hamiltonian is @xmath55 , one can @xmath56 , @xmath57 and eliminate the momentum in the favor of the energy in integral ( 19 ) and switching the order of integration yield the imaginary part of the action as follows @xmath58 } } \\frac{{dr}}{{\\dot r}}\\\\ = { \\mathop{\\rm im}\\nolimits } \\int\\limits_{{r_i}}^{{r_f } } { \\int\\limits_{(m , q)}^{(m - \\varepsilon , q - q ) } { \\frac{{2\\sqrt { 1 - f(m - \\varepsilon ' , q - q',r ) } } } { { f(m - \\varepsilon ' , q - q',r ) } } } } \\left [ { ( 1 - \\alpha { l_p}\\varepsilon ' + { \\alpha ^2}l_p^2{{\\varepsilon ' } ^2 } + \\beta l_p^2{r^2})d(m - \\varepsilon ' ) - \\frac{{q - q'}}{{(d - 3){\\omega _ { d - 2}}{r^{d - 3}}}}d(q - q ' ) } \\right]dr \\end{array}\\ ] ] the r integral can be evaluated by deforming the contour of the single pole at the outer horizon . during the r integral first",
    ", we find @xmath59 this allows us to consider the leading order correction to be just proportional to second order of @xmath60 and also second order of @xmath61 for simplicity without loss of generality . in this",
    "regards , we can finish the integration by applying taylor series and obtain the imaginary part of the action .",
    "although , the integral ( 26 ) is complicated , one can find such terms as an example for @xmath62 as follows @xmath63 substituting ( 26 ) into ( 18 ) , the tunneling probability of charged particles from charged non - rotating tev - scale black holes is obtained as @xmath64\\\\   = \\exp \\left ( { \\delta s } \\right ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the difference in black hole entropies before and after emission @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the emission rates on the high energy scales corresponds to differences between the counting of states in the micro canonical and in the canonical ensembles @xcite . by performing integration on ( 26 )",
    ", one can find that the first order of e in the exponential gives a thermal , boltzmannian spectrum .",
    "the existence of extra terms in relation ( 27 ) shows that the radiation is not completely thermal .",
    "in fact , these extra terms enhance the non - thermal character of the radiation . also , it is easy to find that should be greater than in any stage of tunneling process .",
    "this tunneling rate compared to the tunneling rate which is calculated in @xcite , obviously shows that by considering all natural cutoffs in generalized uncertainty principle relation , many additional terms are appeared .",
    "the additional terms shows strong deviation of micro black holes radiation from ordinary thermal radiation .",
    "it has shown @xcite that black holes radiate a thermal spectrum of particles .",
    "so , micro black holes emit black body radiation at the hawking temperature . following a heuristic argument @xcite , the energy of the hawking particles is @xmath66 and it is deduced for the hawking temperature of black hole based on led scenario , @xmath67 which @xmath68 is a calibration factor in d - dimensional space - time . by saturating inequality ( 4 )",
    ", one can find momentum uncertainty in terms of position uncertainty as follows @xmath69 so , the modified black hole hawking temperature in the presence of natural cutoffs becomes @xmath70 based on equation ( 31 ) , gup give rise to the existence of a minimal mass of a charged non - rotating micro black hole given by @xmath71^{\\frac{1}{{d - 3}}}}\\\\ + \\frac{{{q^2}8\\pi { g_d}}}{{(d - 2)(d - 3){{\\left [ { \\frac { { - \\alpha { l_p } + ( { \\alpha ^2}l_p^2 + 3{\\alpha",

    "whenever a particle is radiated from the micro black hole event horizon , its wave function satisfies a wave equation with an effective potential that depends on outer event horizon .",
    "as the potential represents a barrier to the outgoing radiation , so one part of the radiation is back - scattered .",
    "+ in this way , it can be shown that the distribution @xmath79 for the hawking radiation will be modulated by grey body factor @xcite which for a charged non - rotating tev - scale black hole is given as @xmath80 which @xmath81 is the standard approximated grey body factor . in this way , one can take energy and charge conservation into account @xcite and get the straightforward result by substituting eq .

    "we are taking into account in the integration limits that the maximum energy of a radiated particle could be @xmath84 .",
    "equation ( 38 ) gives larger luminosities for smaller masses .",
    "the results show that in large extra dimension scenario , hawking temperature of charged black hole increases and leads to faster decay and less classical behaviors for black holes ( figure[fig1 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , it has shown @xcite that the allowed particles forming the black hole at the lhc are quarks , antiquarks , and gluons which formed nine possible electric charge states : @xmath85 . in this case",

    ", we considered possible effect of natural cutoffs as a minimal length , a maximal momentum , and a minimal momentum on the tunneling rate .",
    "we have shown that in the presence of generalized uncertainty principle , the tunneling rate of charged massive particle is deviated from thermal emission . in order to study the evolution of the tev - scale micro black hole as it evaporates respecting energy and charge conservation ,",
    "we have also modified the grey - body factor , which allows considering the effect of the back scattered emitted radiation .",
    "we have calculated hawking temperature based on the gup admitted a minimal length , a maximal momentum , and a minimal momentum .",
