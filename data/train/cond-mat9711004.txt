    "coherent structural distortions of the superconducting cuo@xmath0 planes appear to be a crucial issue of the high-@xmath7 cuprates @xcite .",
    "the dimpled basal planes of the cuo@xmath8 pyramides in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 emerged already from early crystallographic work on this material .",
    "tilts of the cuo@xmath9 octahedra in the la 214 family are frequently considered to be at the origin of mesoscopic stripe patterns found in some of their compounds . and ,",
    "as it is well known , the bi family of superconductors exhibits long range order modulations of the cuo@xmath0 layers . on the other side , the superconducting hg cuprates ( exhibiting the highest @xmath7 s )",
    "were found to have undistorted cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "but recent crystallographic work seems to converge to relatively weak dimples ( @xmath10 @xmath4 ) in the basal planes of the cuo@xmath8 pyramides of the two and more layer hg compounds @xcite .",
    "the displacements leading to an effective transversal modulation of the cuo@xmath0 planes may be of different kind and physical origin .  buckling `` in the la 214 family and the long range order modulations in the bi family are understood to arise from tilts of the cuo@xmath9 octahedra and the cuo@xmath8 pyramides , respectively , both exhibiting _ flat _ basal planes . on the other hand , the displacements of the planar cu and/or planar o atoms along @xmath11 labeled ' ' dimples  imply the basal o ",
    "cu  o bonds to be no longer rigid but soft , and to be bent in @xmath11 direction .",
    "the dimpling in metallic y-123 is @xmath12 @xmath4 @xcite , but @xmath13 @xmath4 in metallic hg-1212 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that also other physical properties than metallicity and superconductivity may be at the origin of the dimpling , and the net effect possibly attributable to the superconductivity in the high-@xmath7 cuprates may be as small as 0.05 @xmath4 .",
    "important consequences from this conclusion arise for both , experimental and theoretical work .",
    "first , the structural distortions possibly relevant for the superconductivity in doped mott insulators depend on the carrier concentration . since the doped charge carriers are not expected to be randomly distributed in the cuo@xmath0 planes , the resulting structural deformations most likely break the translational invariance of the underlying lattice .",
    "local probes are therefore important experimental tools for the investigation of this structural problem .",
    "second , if the dimpling of the cuo@xmath0 planes is connected to the mechanism of superconductivity in the cuprates , it is not justified to consider their copper oxygen chemistry in the usual way as forming rigid , strong bonds between the copper atom and the four oxygens .",
    "consequently theoretical work has to allow for dynamical degrees of freedom to treat the oxygen and copper orbitals separately .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the experimentally apparent  soft `` or bent cu ",
    "o bonds is still at its infancy .",
    "but a recent study of the correlations in a high-@xmath7 cuprate using the local ansatz showed that the charge transfer inside the cu atoms is much larger than that between the planar cu and o atoms , due to correlations @xcite .",
    "this finding stresses the need for that atomic correlations of the copper orbitals ( @xmath14 ) have to be taken into account to understand the ' ' soft  cu  o bonding in doped cuprates .    in this brief report",
    "we are presenting measurements of the dimpling in the cuo@xmath0 planes of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 by yttrium exafs , as a function of temperature and doping on both sides of the underdoped - overdoped phase separation line at @xmath5 .",
    "the photoexcited cations in the separating sheet of the two layer cuprates are ideal observers of the local atomic structure of the cuo@xmath0 planes . we have measured the exafs beyond the yttrium @xmath15 edge up to @xmath16 @xmath17 from fine grains ( @xmath18 m ) of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) synthezised under near equilibrium conditons . details of the x - ray spectroscopy ,",
    "the data reduction , and of the synthesis of the samples are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the positions and the vibrational dynamics of the o2,3 and cu2 atoms can be extracted from the nearest and next nearest neighbour two - body scattering configurations y ",
    "o2,3 ; y  cu2 , and the nearly collinear three - body multiple scattering ( ms ) configurations y ",
    "o2,3ba ( @xmath19 @xmath4 ) , y ",
    "cu2ba ( @xmath20 @xmath4 ) . to determine the dimpling as a function of temperature we have exploited the high sensitivity of these two ms configurations to static displacements of the intervening o2,3 and cu2 atoms , respectively . since both ms configurations include the same ba - layer , the ratio of their experimental scattering amplitudes cancels to first order approximation the effects arising from thermal disorder , and the temperature dependent variations of the y  ba distances .",
    "thus we are able to separate the desired information on the static positional changes from the thermal disorder , thereby avoiding weakly based assumptions on the vibrational dynamics of the y  ba cluster .",
    "fig.1 exhibits the temperature and concentration dependencies of the effective scattering amplitudes of y ",
    "o2,3ba ( open circles ) and y  cu2ba ( closed circles ) for three underdoped ( @xmath21 ) and two overdoped samples ( @xmath22 , 6.984 ) ; @xmath23 is close to optimum doping ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the average temperature dependencies exhibit significant deviations from the @xmath25 behaviour expected from harmonic motions of the diatomic pairs y  ba . in addition dips and step - like features occur in the normal conducting temperature region .",
    "@xmath26 exhibits a clear jump at 110 k. we have carefully checked the sources of systematic errors possibly giving rise to the discontinuities in the effective scattering amplitudes , in particular the normalization of the experimental absorption coefficient . as a result we can definitely exclude experimental artefacts to be at the origin of the dips in @xmath27 , @xmath23 , and of the step in @xmath26 around 120 k. we note that the experimental spectra of @xmath26 exhibit the relatively best _",
    "s / n _ , while those of @xmath27 the relatively worst .",
    "the  raw  effective scattering amplitudes in fig.1 show directly the dimpling to depend on both , concentration and temperature .",
    "doping does not significantly affect the overall behavior of the y ",
    "o2,3ba ( open circles ) , but moves that of y ",
    "cu2ba ( closed circles , dashed line ) for all temperatures clearly beyond y  o2,3ba .",
    "since the thermally induced damping is almost the same for both signals , the increasing difference may be straightforwardly attributed to a relative linearization of y ",
    "cu2ba three body scattering geometry ,",
    "_ i.e. _ the cu2 atoms move off the o2,3 plane towards the ba layer .",
    "the temperature dependencies of the dimpling are displayed in fig.2 in ascending order from the underdoped to the overdoped regimes .",
    "the numbers given at the left ordinates are from theoretical fits to the data using the high order ms approach of the feff6 code @xcite .",
    "the data points , except for x=6.886 , exhibit a surprisingly large scatter rendering unambigous determinations of the detailed temperature behaviours difficult .",
    "therefore the superimposed lines ought to be understood as possible guides to the eyes , among others .",
    "well known , many copper oxides are notoriously anomalous around @xmath28 k and @xmath29 k @xcite .",
    "in fact , the dimpling exhibits cusps close to these temperatures , however , a systematic behaviour of these anomalies as a function of doping is hard to extract .",
    "therefore we ignore them here .",
    "the dimpling of @xmath27 and @xmath26 may be seen to be independent on temperature within about @xmath30 @xmath4 .",
    "however , the dimpling of underdoped @xmath26 exhibits a shallow but clear minimum around 150 k ; interestingly the step - like feature in fig.1 at 110 k is almost cancelled .",
    "a minimum around 150 k may be also extracted from nearly optimum doped @xmath23 . in the overdoped regime",
    "the 150 k minimum vanishes : the dimpling of @xmath22 is almost constant at @xmath31 k , but increases at @xmath32 k. ignoring the strong cusp around 210 k the dimpling of overdoped @xmath33 may be seen to increase linearily from 300 to 20 k.",
    "the dimples in the cuo@xmath0 planes of doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 and their variations with oxygen concentration and temperature appear to be intimately connected with its superconducting properties .",
    "the well known doping - induced increase of @xmath7 is connected with increased dimples .",
    "a significant discontinuity occurs at the underdoped - overdoped phase separation line ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "some of us have recently shown that the discontinuity in the static dimpling correlates with a sudden drop of the raman o2,3 in - phase shift ( @xmath34 dimpling mode ) at @xmath5 , giving hard evidence for a new displacive structural phase transformation in the cuo@xmath0 planes @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependent data presented in this report confirm the close connection between the dimpling and the transition from the underdoped into the overdoped regimes for @xmath35 k. moreover , at least for underdoped @xmath26 , the dimpling appears to be unambigously connected to a characteristic temperature in the normal state , @xmath36 k.    interestingly , the variations of the dimpling related with the dramatic variations of the superconducting properties on doping are comparatively weak , @xmath10 @xmath4 , _",
    "i.e _ only @xmath37% of the total dimpling .",
    "thus its superconductivity related fraction may be seen to reside on top of an  offset  arising from the particular band structure @xcite .",
