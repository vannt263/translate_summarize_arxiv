    "our first goal in this paper is to define the fukaya - seidel categories for positive allowable lefschetz fibrations , palfs in short , and prove their invariance under the condition that the two - fold first chern class is zero .",
    "the fukaya - seidel categories are defined for exact lefschetz fibrations , which are , roughly speaking , lefschetz fibrations with suitable exact symplectic structure @xcite .",
    "those categories are studied in the context of homological mirror symmetry .",
    "the celebrated homological mirror symmetry conjecture was first proposed by kontsevich @xcite and predicts the equivalence of two triangulated categories @xmath0 and @xmath1 for certain pairs of calabi - yau manifolds @xmath2 , called mirror pair . here",
    "the former category @xmath0 is the split closure of the derived fukaya category of @xmath3 as a symplectic manifold @xcite and the latter category @xmath4 is the derived category of the category of coherent sheaves on @xmath5 as a complex manifold .",
    "this conjecture is proved for several pairs of calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and so on .",
    "the fukaya - seidel categories appear when we consider the case that @xmath5 is a fano manifold . in this case , the mirror partner of @xmath5 is a landau - ginzburg model @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the landau - ginzburg model is a holomorphic function @xmath6 on a khler manifold , called potential function , with isolated singularities . the derived fukaya - seidel category @xmath7 is the triangulated category defined by using the data of the singularities , with the techniques of symplectic geometry @xcite , expected to be equivalent to @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , palfs are one of the most studied geometric structure in 4-dimensional topology .",
    "the lefschetz fibrations are completely determined in terms of monodromy operator on a regular fibre , so it is related to the study of mapping class groups of oriented surfaces , hence it has a combinatorial nature @xcite .",
    "if a given 4-manifold admits a structure of lefschetz fibration , we can compute its homology groups , fundamental groups , and ( some part of ) the intersection forms by the data of monodromy .",
    "moreover , if closed 4-manifold @xmath5 admits a structure of closed lefschetz fibration , we can compute the signature of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "there are two very fundamental results .",
    "the first result due to donaldson shows that every symplectic 4-manifold admits a structure of lefschetz fibration after sufficiently many times of blow - ups @xcite .",
    "the second result due to gompf @xcite is that every positive lefschetz fibration admits a symplectic structure .",
    "after those two papers , there are many studies involving techniques of both symplectic geometry and palfs , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    along this context",
    ", the author proposes a new method to study the palfs with symplectic technique , the derived fukaya - seidel categories .",
    "we first prove that any palf admits a structure of exact lefschetz fibration ( theorem [ thm : eexactsymplecticstr ] ) .",
    "thereafter , we prove that the derived fukaya - seidel category of a palf is independent of the choice of the exact symplectic structure attached to the palf ( theorem [ thm : invoffscat ] ) .",
    "we can say that the concept of fukaya - seidel categories is a  categorification \" of the milnor lattices since the k - groups of the derived fukaya - seidel categories coincide with the milnor lattices .",
    "thus , we naturally expect that the derived fukaya - seidel categories catch some sensitive information that we can not capture it by the milnor lattices . in section [ sec : exandprob ] , we study examples ( theorem [ thm : computationalex ] ) showing that this is true , i.e. the fukaya - seidel categories do have more information than the milnor lattices . in this theorem , we distinguish three palfs that they share the same milnor lattice by their hochschild cohomology groups of fukaya - seidel categories . hence , we have a new method to distinguish palfs .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows . in section [ sec : algpre1 ] , we review basic definitions and properties of @xmath8-categories . in section [ sec : fscat ] , we review the definition of the fukaya - seidel categories step by step and present a combinatorial description .",
    "the combinatorial description is only used for the computation of examples in section [ sec : exandprob ] and [ sec : prfofcompex ] . in section [ sec : lfandexactstr ] , we construct structures of exact lefschetz fibrations to palfs . in section [ sec : invoffscat ] , we prove theorem [ thm : invoffscat ] , which is the main theorem of this paper . in section [ sec : exandprob ] , we study some examples and present a problem . in section [ sec : prfofcompex ] , we prove some statements remained unproved in section [ sec : exandprob ] .    throughout this paper ,",

    "these three palfs can be distinguished by hochschild cohomology groups as follows .",
    "[ thm : computationalex ]    the above three lefschetz fibrations can be distinguished in terms of fukaya - seidel categories .",
    "namely , their hochschild cohomology groups are as follows :    @xmath763    the proof of this theorem is presented in the next section .",
    "the milnor lattices of the above three lefschetz fibrations all agree , so this is an example that the fukaya - seidel categories do have more information than the milnor lattices .",
    "but in fact , the total space of @xmath764 are not homeomorphic each other , so there leave a lot to be desired .",
    "one can prove this by computing their first homology groups @xmath765 , and @xmath766 by the mayer - vietris exact sequence .",
    "so , there emerges a natural question :    [ prob : fscathavemoreinfo ]    is there two palfs @xmath767 with vanishing of the two - fold first chern class such that the total spaces are homeomorphic ( or diffeomorphic ) , the milnor lattices are isomorphic , but their category of twisted complexes of fukaya - seidel categories are not equivalent ?",
    "the category of twisted complexes has more information than the derived category of a given @xmath8-category .",
    "namely , kajiura @xcite proposed two @xmath8-categories @xmath768 and @xmath769 in such that @xmath770 but @xmath771 . so there",

    "this asks that whether there exist two lefschetz fibrations @xmath767 such that @xmath772 but @xmath773 .",
    "let us calculate the derived fukaya - seidel categories for @xmath767 , and @xmath731 in section [ sec : exandprob ] .",
    "now , we can choose @xmath774 , and @xmath775 in figure [ fig : lfs ] as vanishing cycles which means that there exists @xmath87 such that @xmath776 . for @xmath777 and @xmath778",

    ", we should use a symplectic form @xmath93 such that two triangles have the same area and its primitive @xmath87 satisfying @xmath780 .",
    "then , @xmath781 automatically holds .",
    "we name the distinguished basis of vanishing cycles of @xmath782 by @xmath783 . here , @xmath572 out of @xmath784 is the vanishing cycle of @xmath785 and @xmath572 out of @xmath786 is the vanishing cycle of @xmath787 etc .",
    "we use the same symbol @xmath572 for the first vanishing cycle of @xmath788 , and @xmath778 .",
    "we write the lagrangian branes corresponding to @xmath774 , and @xmath775 by @xmath789 , and @xmath790 and name the intersection points by @xmath791 for @xmath277 .",

    "since we have @xmath799 , we can conclude that @xmath800 by the same discussion in remark [ rem : degofmu ] .",

    "our moduli space @xmath804 has two elements , namely @xmath805 and @xmath806 ( one is small and another is a big gray one in figure [ fig : pi1 ] ) .",
    "let us consider the sign @xmath807 .",
