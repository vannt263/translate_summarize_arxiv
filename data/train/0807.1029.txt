    "oscillators providing stable sub-100 fs pulses in the near - infrared region around 1.5  @xmath0 m are of interest for a number of applications including infrared continuum generation @xcite and high - sensitivity gas spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "to date , the typical realization of such sources is based on a femtosecond er : fiber oscillator with an external pulse amplification .",
    "a promising alternative to such combination is a solid - state cr@xmath1:yag mode - locked oscillator @xcite .",
    "such an oscillator allows a direct diode pumping and possesses the gain band providing the few - optical cycle pulses .",
    "however , attempts to increase the pulse energy in a cr : yag oscillator is limited by its relatively small gain coefficient .",
    "because of the low gain , the oscillator has to operate with low output couplers and , thereby , the intra - resonator pulse energy has to be high . as a result , the instabilities appear @xcite . to suppress the instabilities in the negative dispersion regime ( ndr ) a fair amount of the group - delay - dispersion ( gdd )",
    "is required .",
    "the resulting pulse is a relatively long soliton with reduced peak power .",
    "such a pulse is nearly transform - limited and is not compressible .",
    "a remedy is to use the positive dispersion regime ( pdr ) , when the pulse is stabilized due to substantial stretching ( up to few picoseconds ) caused by a large chirp @xcite .",
    "such a pulse is dispersion - compressible down to few tens of femtoseconds .    for both ndr and pdr , the oscillator will eventually become unstable at high power .",
    "the main scenarios of the pulse destabilization have been identified with the multipulsing in the ndr @xcite and the cw - amplification in the pdr @xcite .",
    "it has been found , that the higher - order dispersions ( i.e. , the frequency dependent gdd ) and losses significantly modify the stability conditions @xcite .",
    "hence , the study of the stability conditions affected by both linear and nonlinear processes inherent in a mode - locked oscillator remains an important task .",
    "here , we present a study of the destabilization mechanisms of a cr : yag mode - locked oscillator , operating in both ndr and pdr .",
    "we put a special emphasis on the influence of the spectral dependence of gdd and losses on the oscillator stability .",
    "the cr : yag oscillator has been built on the basis of the scheme published in refs .",
    "the mode - locking and the dispersion control were provided by sesam and chirped - mirrors ( cms ) , respectively .",
    "the gdd of intra - resonator elements as well as the net - gdd are shown in fig .",

    "parameter @xmath110.028 is the saturated gain coefficient at @xmath8 , and it is close to the net - loss value at this frequency .",

    "parameter @xmath22 is the difference between the saturated gain @xmath23 and the net loss at the reference frequency @xmath8 .",
    "it was assumed , that this parameter depends on the full pulse energy:@xmath24 , where @xmath25 corresponds to the full energy stored inside an oscillator in the cw regime @xcite .",

    "it was found , that the gdd decrease in the pdr results in the cw - amplification ( see the black curve in fig .",

    "the cw - amplification appears in the vicinity of the spectral net - loss minimum , where the saturated net - gain becomes positive .",
    "the latter occurs because gain saturation decreases with gdd approaching to zero .",
    "simultaneously , the spectrum gets broader , which enhances the spectral losses and , thereby reduces the pulse energy .",

    "[ fig4 ] , _ a _ ) . in this case , the chaotic oscillations of the peak power appear ( _ chaotic mode - locking _",
    "the spectrum edges in such a regime become smoothed and the spectrum shifts to the local gdd - minimum .",
    "it was found @xcite , that the pdr stability is improved in the vicinity of the local minimum of the gdd ( i.e. , when the fourth - order dispersion is positive ) .",
    "[ fig4 ] , _ b _ shows the spectrum ( gray curve ) corresponding to the lower on gdd stability border of pdr .",

    "@xmath0 m , other parameters correspond to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the case without spectrally - dependent losses.,height=302 ]",
    "in the ndr and in the absence of higher - order dispersions , the pulse can be stabilized only by a signifivant amount of the negative gdd ( @xmath30 - 9900 fs@xmath28 in our case ) .",
    "however , the contribution of higher - order dispersions can stabilize the pulse in the immediate vicinity of zero gdd ( black curves in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the pulse is stable if even a part of spectrum is situated within the positive gdd range ( left picture in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "gdd spectral profiles ( dashed ) and corresponding simulated pulse spectra without ( black ) and with ( gray ) spectral dependence of the losses .",
    "the losses are assumed to have a local minimum at 1.53 @xmath0 m about -0.025 fs@xmath18 , height=226 ]    however , the ndr stability in the vicinity of zero gdd is very sensitive to the spectral dependence of the losses .",
    "presence of such dependence leads to the multipulsing ( harmonic mode - locking , gray curves in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . as it was found @xcite",
    ", the source of multipulsing is the insufficiently saturated net - gain , which appears in the vicinity of zero gdd due to decrease of the pulse energy caused by the spectral losses .    in analogy with the pdr",
    ", the spectral dependence of gdd can initiate the chaotic mode - locking , when the negative gdd approaches zero ( gray curve in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the spectrum shifts from the region , where the local minimum of gdd is located .",
    "this behaviour is reverse in the comparison with that in the pdr .",
    "thus , the stability regions of pdr and ndr are disjointed by a region of chaotic mode - locking in the vicinity of zero gdd .    just as the `` m - shaped '' spectra appear in the pdr , when the fourth - order dispersion leads to the gdd growth on the spectrum edges , the humps of the spectrum envelope exist in the ndr ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the pdr , the local spectral maxima appear in the vicinity of local maxima of gdd .",
    "gdd spectral profile ( dashed ) and corresponding simulated pulse spectrum in the negative dispersion regime with modulated dispersion and no spectral dependence of the losses.,height=302 ]",
    "we have studied stability conditions of a cr : yag oscillator in both , positive and negative dispersion regimes . in the ndr , the oscillator exhibits strong tendency to harmonic mode - locking ( i.e. , multipulsing ) , which can be suppressed only by a significant amount of the negative gdd .",
    "the gdd value providing the multipulsing suppression depends on the gdd shape , so that the soliton - like regime can exist even if the part of the spectrum lies within the positive dispersion range .",
    "the spectrum maximum shifts in the region , where the local maximum of gdd is located .",
    "the presence of the spectrally - dependent losses enhances the multipulsing in the vicinity of zero gdd .",
    "when the gdd is frequency - dependent , the positive- and negative - dispersion single - pulse regimes are disjointed by the gdd ranges with chaotic and harmonic mode locking . in the pdr , approaching of the gdd to zero results in a cw - amplification or a chaotic mode - locking .",
    "the last regime appears if the gdd is frequency - dependent .",
    "the stabilizing factor of such frequency dependence is the presence of a local minimum ( for the pdr ) or maximum ( for the ndr ) of gdd in the vicinity of the pulse spectrum .",
