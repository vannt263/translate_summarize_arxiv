    "our interest is to study under laboratory conditions matter as it existed during the era of the early universe at which temperatures were in excess of 200 mev , thought to be less than @xmath0s after the big bang .",
    "beams of heaviest nuclei at relativistic energies are the tools in this research program : in nuclear heavy ion collisions the participating strongly interacting hadronic nuclear matter is compressed and heated . unlike the early universe , the volume occupied by such laboratory ` micro bang ' is small , see fig.[figmicrobang ] . however , our hope and expectation is that collisions of largest nuclei which are now studied experimentally will allow us to explore conditions akin to infinite systems of hot hadronic matter .",
    "another difference with the early universe condition is , as shown in fig.[figmicrobang ] , that though one of the most characteristic features of these heavy ion collisions is the formation of many new particles , their number per nucleon ( baryon ) remains considerably smaller than was present at the low baryon density of matter present in the early universe .",
    "much of the theoretical effort in this field is thus devoted to the understanding and interpretation of the experimental data and in particular their extrapolation to conditions of long lived , statistically equilibrated matter with low baryon density .",
    "the great variety of hadronic particles known ( mesons , baryons ) implies that the structure and properties of their source will be very rich , and could comprise some new and unexpected phenomena .",
    "our present discussion will , however , be limited to consideration of just two model phases of highly excited hadronic matter :    1 .",
    "the conventional , confined phase we shall call hadronic gas ( hg ) , consisting of hadronic particles of different type , ( including short lived resonances ) , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , etc .",
    ", with masses and degeneracies in most cases well known .",
    "along with hagedorn @xcite , we presume that particle interactions in hg are accounted for by giving the resonances the status of independent fractions in the gas ; 2 .   the deconfined phase will be seen as a liquid of quarks and gluons , interacting perturbatively , an approach which is properly justified only in the limit of very high energy densities .",
    "we shall call this phase the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "our specific objective is to discover and explore this new form of matter @xcite .",
    "there is today considerable interest in the study of the transformation of strongly interacting matter between these two phases .",
    "considerable theoretical effort is committed in the framework of finite temperature lattice gauge theory@xcite to perform simulations with the objective to obtain a better understanding of the properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature . in analogy to water - vapor transition",
    "we expect and indeed see that two phases of hadronic matter are separated by a first order phase transition .",
    "however , the theoretical simulations also suggest that it could well be that there is no transition , just a phase cross - over , similar to the situation prevailing in the atomic gas transition to electron - ion plasma .",
    "a comparison between theory and experiment will be always subject to the constraint that a true phase transitions can not develop in a finite system .",
    "however , the number of accessible degrees of freedom that are being excited in collisions of heavy nuclei is very large , and this should allow us to explore the properties of the true infinite matter phase transition using finite nuclei as projectiles and targets .",
    "it is for this reason that beams of largest nuclei are the required experimental tools in this research program .",
    "another way to look at the phase transformation between the two prototype phases , hg and qgp , arises from the consideration of the nature and in particular the transport properties of the vacuum state of strong interactions : in the qgp phase ( the ` perturbative vacuum state ' ) it is allowing for the free propagation of quark and gluon _ color _ charges .",
    "the ` true vacuum ' in which we live is a color charge insulator , only the color neutral mesons and baryons can propagate . because at high temperature we cross to the conductive phase , it is possible to consider the change in the properties of the vacuum akin to the situation with normal matter . moreover , from the theoretical point of view , the observation of the ` vacuum melting ' and the study of the properties of the perturbative and true vacuum is the primary objective of the nucleus - nucleus high energy collision experimental program  high energy nuclear collisions are today the only known laboratory method allowing the study of extended space - time regions containing a locally modified vacuum state .",
    "inside the domain of perturbative vacuum , at sufficiently high excitation energy we expect to encounter a quantum gas of quarks and gluons subject to the qcd perturbative interactions characterized by the ( running ) coupling constant @xmath5 .",
    "even though the strength of the qcd interactions is considerably greater than the strength of electromagnetic interactions , @xmath6 , the moderate magnitude @xmath7 at the energy scales corresponding to temperatures of @xmath8 mev should permit us to study the quark matter in a first estimate of its properties , as if it consisted of a gas of quarks and gluons interacting perturbatively .",
    "we will consider in this way the strangeness production , and also use perturbative expressions in @xmath5 to improve the free quantum gas equations of state of quarks and gluons .",
    "we use the analytical expressions up to the region of the phase cross - over to the confined hadronic gas world , hoping that the qualitative features of the deconfined phase will be appropriately described in that way .",
    "clearly , this is a domain that will see in future more effort both in terms of improvements of the perturbative expressions , and also due to further exploration of numerical lattice gauge theory results .",
    "relativistic heavy ion experimental programs at the ags accelerator at the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) and at the sps accelerator at the european center of nuclear research ( cern ) in geneva , begun in 198687 . from the onset of the program",
    "it was assumed that the higher the collision energy and the heavier the colliding nuclei , the greater the energy density that could be created and hence more extreme conditions of matter and , e.g. , earlier the time since the beginning of our universe one expects to be able to study .",
    "moreover , it is expected that as the energy and thus the rapidity gap , see fig.[figrap ] , is growing , the chances increase to form a truly baryon - free region on space time , more similar to the conditions prevailing in the early universe , see fig.[figmicrobang ] .",
    "for these reason new facilities were build and before the end of the century , the next generation of experiments will exploit the 100a+100a gev relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl , sporting 10 times the cm - energy available today at sps .",
    "the race is on , and at cern collisions of heavy ions up to about 3.5a+3.5a tev will become feasible upon completion of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . here",
    "yet considerably more extreme conditions should be reached , as the collision energies are 400 times higher than accessible today at sps .",
    "the expected onset of the lhc program follows rhic schedule by about 7 years .    in this article",
    "we will address mainly strange particle production in collisions at 200a gev .",
    "this center of interest arises from the prediction @xcite , that the ( enhanced ) production of ( multi)strange antibaryons is specifically related to color deconfinement : in the deconfined qgp phase we find enhanced production of strangeness flavor by thermal glue based processes , leading to high @xmath9 densities , which in turn leads to highly enhanced production of strange antibaryons .",
    "moreover , the strange antibaryon particle production mechanisms being very different from the usual ones , the behavior of the yields ( cross sections ) with energy will be shown here to differ considerably from usual expectations .",
    "the strange antibaryon particle signature of qgp requires that the transition from the deconfined state to the confined final hadronic gas phase consisting of individual hadrons occurs sufficiently rapidly in order to assure that the memory of the high density of strangeness in the early phase is not erased .    as noted above the enhanced qgp strangeness yield",
    "depends to some extend on _ thermal _ equilibrium gluon collision frequency .",
    "many experimental results , which we survey in the following suggest that the particles produced in heavy ion collisions are indeed thermal , i.e. , that either they have been produced by a thermal source , e.g. , in a recombination of thermal constituents , or that they have had time to scatter and thermalize after formation .",
    "this means that the thermalization of the energy content in heavy ion reactions is rapid on the time scale of the collision .",
    "the required mechanisms of such a rapid thermalization and associated entropy production are today unknown in detail , but plausible given the large number of accessible degrees of freedom in high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "this survey comprises three logical parts    * experimental results and their analysis , * strange quark production and fireball dynamics , * final state particle production ,    and we outline briefly in the following three paragraphs their respective contents .",
    "it is clearly not possible to present here a comprehensive discussion of the ten years of experimental effort .",
    "rather , in following section [ tools ] , we will briefly address the highlights of the experimental results .",
    "we then turn to the main topic of the paper in section [ secstroverv ] .",
    "we introduce strange particle properties , discuss diagnostic tools in more detail and describe the key strangeness ( antibaryon ) experimental results obtained at sps in subsection [ expres ] .",
    "in section [ secanalysis ] we use the framework of the thermal fireball model to analyze the experimental strange antibaryon ratios and to derive the properties of the source .    in section [ thermalfsec ]",
    "we develop the equations of state of the qgp - fireball and use these to determine the initial conditions which we expect to be formed in different collisions . applying conservation of energy and baryon number we also obtain the properties of the fireball at different important instances in its evolution .",
    "this is done for all systems studied currently at cern and bnl experimental facilities and we show that there is a profound difference between the 15a gev bnl data and the 200a gev cern data , which precludes interpretation of the low energy results in terms of a ( suddenly disintegrating ) qgp - fireball .",
    "we then turn our attention in section [ strprod ] to a comprehensive study of the qcd ",
    "qgp based thermal strangeness production and also discuss briefly the related topics of the thermal charm production .",
    "the production of strangeness being strongly dependent on the magnitude of the strong interaction coupling constant , we develop in section [ runalfasec ] the renormalization group based description of the appropriate value . in section [ gammas ]",
    "we explore the variation of the phase space occupancy of strange and charmed particles in the different collision environments .",
    "we now turn our attention to the particle production yields : we discuss the hadronization constraints and parameters in the section [ hadromod ] , and present the excitation functions of multistrange particles and their ratios in section [ results ] . in the final section [ endrem ]",
    "we give a brief evaluation of our work .",
    "the reader should be aware from the outset that the observation of a transient new phase of matter , formed and existing just for a brief instant in time , perhaps for no more than @xmath10s , is only possible if time reversibility is broken in a shorter time , which is implicitly presumed in this field of research . in our work",
    "this is implicitly assumed when we introduce the thermal fireball .",
    "however , how this quantum decoherence occurs is one of the great open problems that challenges us today .      given the assumption of rapid decoherence we can seek accessible observables which can distinguish between micro - bangs comprising the two prototype phases , the hg , or the qgp that subsequently hadronizes .",
    "several useful experimental signatures of dense hadronic matter and specifically the formation and properties of qgp have been now theoretically and experimentally explored .",
    "these can be categorized as follows :    1 .",
    "* electromagnetic probes : * + @xmath11 _ direct photons _ and _ dileptons _ @xcite",
    ". since quarks are electromagnetically charged , their collisions produce these particles , and the yields are highly sensitive to the initial conditions , for example in relatively ` cold ' matter the direct photons can be hidden by the @xmath12 process .",
    "* hadronic probes : * + @xmath11 _ strangeness _ @xcite ( and also charm ) is the topic of primary interest here  theoretical considerations show that in the deconfined quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase high local strange and antistrange particle density is reached permitting abundant formation of strange antibaryons .",
    "furthermore , enhanced production of strangeness is expected comparing qgp - based theoretical strangeness yield to reactions involving cascades of interacting , confined hadrons . experimental comparison between a  a and n ",
    "n collisions reveals indeed such an enhancement at 200 gev a @xcite , not seen in n  a interactions at 200 gev @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath11 global observables such as _ particle abundance _ measure the entropy produced in the collision @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath11 _ hanbury brown - twiss _ ( hbt ) interferometry allows to determine the particle source size @xcite .",
    "* charmonium : * + @xmath11 even though the charmonium state @xmath13 is a hadronic particle , the way it is proposed as an observable it different from the other hadronic probes , and its small yield also reminds us more of an electromagnetic probe .",
    "once produced in the initial interactions , @xmath14 is used akin to x - rays in the roentgen picture : from the shadows of remaining abundance we seek to deduce a picture of the hadronic matter traversed  @xcite .",
    "we believe that our recent advances@xcite in the study of strange particle production have brought about the long aspired substantiation of the formation of deconfined and nearly statistically equilibrated qgp phase at energies available at the sps accelerator , @xmath15 gev .",
    "we reach this conclusion because the observed abundances of strange antibaryons are closely following the expected pattern characteristic for a rapidly hadronizing deconfined phase , at the same time as an excess of entropy @xcite characteristic for melted hidden ( color ) degrees of freedom is recorded .",
    "we can reach this conclusion because unlike the other particle observables , the final state observable ` strangeness ' is more than just one average quantity which is enhanced when one compares nucleon - nucleon ( n  n ) and nucleon - nucleus ( n  a ) reactions with nucleus - nucleus ( a  a ) interactions . the interesting aspects of this observable",
    "is that there are many different particles , and that certain strange particles ( strange antibaryons ) appear much more enhanced , since their production is rather suppressed in conventional interactions .",
    "one of the best studied observables are spectra of hadronic particles  it is convenient to represent these using instead of the longitudinal momentum , the rapidity @xmath16 and to use the transverse mass @xmath17 instead of the transverse momentum of a particle : @xmath18 where ` @xmath19 ' is perpendicular to the collision axis ` @xmath20 ' . while @xmath17 is invariant under lorentz transformations along the collision axis , the particle rapidity @xmath16 is additive , that is , it changes by the constant value of the transformation for all particles .",
    "this allows to choose the suitable ( cm  center of momentum ) reference frame characterized by its rapidity @xmath21 for the study of the particle spectra .",
    "simple kinematic considerations show that the center of momentum frame in nuclear collisions is for symmetric systems just is 1/2 of the projectile rapidity , and for asymmetric collisions such as s ",
    "au / w / pb systems with the participating masses @xmath22 , @xmath23 of the projectile and , respectively , target nuclei one finds @xcite ( neglecting small corrections ) : @xmath24 assuming small impact parameter collisions with a suitable central trigger , all projectile nucleons participate while the target participants @xmath23 can be estimated from a geometric ` interacting tube ' model .",
    "the geometric picture is well supported by the linear relation of the size of the reaction zone , defined to be @xmath25 , the square root of the reaction cross section , and the geometric size of the interacting nuclei in central collision , @xmath26 .",
    "we show this in fig.[figgeometry ] .",
    "once the central rapidity is confirmed experimentally , this allows the determination of the cm - energy involved in the interaction .",
    "the geometric approach reproduces well the value of central rapidity around which the particle spectra are centered . in the specific case of 200a",
    "au / w / pb interactions one sees @xmath27 @xcite",
    ". however , the shape and the width of rapidity spectra is providing proof that much of the primary longitudinal momentum remains as collective longitudinal flow which tends to expand the source in longitudinal direction .",
    "the central rapidity wa85@xcite transverse mass spectra @xmath28 of diverse strange particles are shown in the fig.[specwa85 ] .",
    "similar results were also obtained by the na35 collaboration @xcite and these temperatures are consistent with the results considered here .",
    "it is striking that within the observed interval @xmath29 gev the particle spectra are exponential , as required for a thermal source , irrespective of potential presence of longitudinal collision flow . very significantly",
    ", there is clearly a common inverse slope temperature , with its inverse value around @xmath30 mev .    these spectral @xmath17 shapes lead to the suggestion that hadronic particles were produced by a thermal source with temperature @xmath31 ( particle spectra inverse slopes ) .",
    "we will discuss in more detail the many consequences of this simple remark in the following section [ tmod ] . here , we emphasize that the observed temperatures vary for different systems and energies . in collisions of s with au nuclei at sps , at 200a gev , record temperatures of the magnitude of @xmath32 mev have been observed , which value is much greater than the temperatures @xmath33(160 mev ) that were noted in @xmath34@xmath34 collisions @xcite .",
    "the use of thermal models to describe the @xmath34@xmath34 collisions has been often critically scrutinized .",
    "however , the experimental evidence in favor of thermal source in relativistic nuclear collisions is overwhelming and the physics motivation considering the large number of participating degree of freedom considerably stronger .",
    "it is remarkable that the same thermal behavior was seen for this @xmath17 range by the wa80 collaboration@xcite for the neutral hadrons @xmath35 . in fig.[specwa80",
    "] we have reploted the wa80 results multiplying the invariant cross sections by the power @xmath36 , so that there is direct correspondence between the data of experiments wa85 and wa80 ,",
    "both experiments focus on the central region in rapidity @xmath37 .",
    "the upper straight line in fig.[specwa80 ] corresponds to an eye - ball thermal fit ( emphasized in the wa85 @xmath17-interval @xmath38 gev ) , with @xmath30 mev for the s  ag system , the lower solid line is for s  s collisions and was done with @xmath39 mev .",
    "the choice of s  s temperature was based on the wa94 @xcite results for spectra of strange antibaryons .",
    "note that we separated by factor 0.4 the @xmath40 s  s results from the s ",
    "au results ; and that the relative @xmath41 to @xmath40 normalization enhancement is 2.5 , which factors makes the @xmath41 abundance fall onto the @xmath40 yields .",
    "it is noteworthy that the wa80 particle spectra span 7 decades .",
    "the rise in meson yield at low @xmath17 is due to the here unaccounted contribution of decaying resonances produced very abundantly in hot hadronic matter .",
    "similarly , some of the concavity of the spectrum arises from non - trivial and in the current approach unaccounted flow effects .",
    "photons and leptons are , on first sight , the most promising probes of dense hadronic matter@xcite .",
    "electromagnetic interactions are strong enough to lead to an initial detectable signal , with secondary interactions being too weak to alter substantially the shape and yield of the primary spectra .",
    "thus direct photons and leptons contain information about the properties of dense matter in the initial moments of the collision .",
    "of particular interest could be the exploration of the initial time period leading to the formation of the thermal equilibrium .    in all interactions",
    "in which we can form final state photons , also dileptons can be produced in the decay of a off - mass shell photon : @xmath42 . here , the dilepton pair produced at a given ( central ) rapidity @xmath16 is solely characterized by its invariant mass @xmath43 . because the dilepton formation requires one additional electromagnetic interaction , the dilepton yield is considerably smaller , by a factor 300 or more , compared to the yield of direct photons .",
    "however , the presence of numerous hadronic particles that can decay into photons and/or dileptons implies that the experimental sensitivity is also related to the strength of these backgrounds , and in this respect experience has shown that dileptons hold a small edge over direct photons .",
    "the photon backgrounds are substantial , essentially arising from neutral meson decays .",
    "@xmath40 decay in flight produces also high energy photons , and in sps experiments even at several gev ( in the cm frame of a fireball ) the backgrounds are significant , covering up within today s experimental precision in s ",
    "w / pb all direct signals of dense matter . on the other hand , the measured high energy @xmath44 yield ,",
    "given the multi - segmentation of the wa80/93/98 @xmath44-detector , allows to reconstruct the spectrum of very high energy mesons as shown above in fig.[specwa80 ] , providing a rare comprehensive glimpse of the hadronic particle spectrum over many decades of yield .",
    "it is not likely that the situation will change greatly in more energetic , thus ` hotter ' interactions , unless a major change of the reaction mechanism occurs : the radiance of direct photons and the entropy content , which defines the final hadron multiplicity and thus secondary yield of photons and leptons , are both rising in a similar way with temperature .",
    "consequently , the signal to background ratio is relatively unaffected .",
    "what can have considerable impact is the life span of the hot initial state : because we are far from equilibrium conditions for electromagnetic probes , the direct photon yield is proportional to the life span of the hot matter fireball .",
    "since the size of the initial system is proportional to the life span of a freely exploding fireball , considerable advantage will result when the present experiments with the relatively small system ( s  pb ) are extended to the largest available pb  pb collisions .",
    "we expect an enhancement by factor 4 of the direct photon signal , compared to the hadron decay backgrounds .",
    "consequently , if indeed the current experimental situation , as has been repeatedly suggested , is just at the sensitivity limit , a very strong direct photon signal of new physics should be seen in the ongoing pb  pb cern experiments .",
    "the subtle advantage of dileptons over photons arises from the possibility to consider the yield of dileptons as function of the lepton pair invariant mass @xmath45 : hadronic particle decays occur within well defined regions of @xmath45 and hence one can expect windows of opportunity in which the backgrounds are small .",
    "specifically , in the rather wide interval @xmath46 there are no hadron resonances contributing to the dilepton background .",
    "thus in the middle of this dilepton yield dip , around @xmath47gev , any additional radiance is more easy to note @xcite .",
    "several cern experiments ( na34/3 , na38 ) have seen in s ",
    "pb / u interactions considerable dilepton yield above background in this kinematic domain @xcite .",
    "a typical calculation of the dimuon yields as function of the invariant mass , taken from our earlier work @xcite is shown in fig.[fini3 ] : the solid line is the sum of the thermal qgp dimuons ( short - dashed contribution ) , the hadron contribution ( long - dashed component ) and the drell  yan ( with @xmath48 ) together with renormalized @xmath49 contributions ( dotted line , chosen to fit the @xmath49 peak ) .",
    "recently , na34/3 and na45 have furthermore reported considerable enhancement of the dilepton yield in the low @xmath50 gev region @xcite .",
    "though more spectacular , the physical meaning of this result hinges on a comprehensive understanding of many possible hadron resonance process that could produce low @xmath45-dileptons , and thus is potentially primarily a probe of the confined hadronic rather than deconfined qgp phase .",
    "all these dilepton enhancements reported do not contradict the lack of associated direct photon signatures , which turn out to be just not visible given the background levels .",
    "on the other hand , we can justly expect that if the dilepton phenomena described here are indeed related to primordial new physics effects , we should see them clearly also in photon radiance , when the new data for the much larger pb  pb collisions is analyzed . on the other hand",
    ", should the dilepton results not manifest themselves in the direct photon enhancement , it is likely that these originate from some not fully understood normal hadronic effect , and thus are of considerable lesser physical relevance .",
    "experimental results show the predicted @xcite suppression of the charmonium yield after its interaction with dense matter @xcite . despite early hope that the interaction of charmonium @xmath13 state with dense hadronic matter will be able to distinguish the difference in structure of the confined and deconfined matter",
    ", more recent and detailed theoretical studies accounting for the composite structure of charmonium @xcite have revealed that the absorption / dissolution of charmonium in strongly interacting matter is similar for the different structures here considered .",
    "consequently , the suppression of charmonium production in nuclear interactions involving passage of @xmath14 through the dense matter , can be now accounted for both by interaction with confined and unconfined dense matter .",
    "while we therefore can not on the basis of this effect obtain evidence for or against formation of qgp phase , the observed suppression phenomenon provides in itself a very clear confirmation of the formation of a rather small and localized , dense hadronic matter region .",
    "pion and kaon correlation functions are measured to study the space - time evolution of the hadronic source .",
    "they are simply obtained from the ratio of the two particle cross section to the product of the two single particle cross sections , taken preferably from two different events to assure exclusion of correlation effects .",
    "the resulting correlation @xmath51 is fitted to the convenient form valid for azimuthally symmetric sources : @xmath52,\\ ] ] where ` @xmath53 ' ( longitudinal ) denotes the two particle momentum projection onto the axis parallel to the beam , and ` @xmath54 ' and ` @xmath55 ' are the directions perpendicular to beam axis : ` @xmath54 ' ( out ) is parallel and ` @xmath55 ' ( side ) is orthogonal to the two particle transverse momentum sum axis . the last term in eq.([fithbt ] ) , which mixes the components @xmath56 and @xmath57 has been often neglected @xcite .",
    "compared to hbt interferometry of stars , the situation in heavy - ion collisions is complicated by the finite lifetime and the strong dynamical evolution of the particle emitting source .",
    "thus the interpretation of the observed correlations between the produced particles is in general model - dependent , and a considerable amount of theoretical effort has been spent on the question to what extent this intrinsic model dependence can be reduced by a refined analysis  @xcite .",
    "the hbt type interpretation of experimental results leads to the following hypothesis regarding the particle source :    1 .   emission of particles is chaotic ( @xmath58 ) , 2 .",
    "correlated particles do not arise primarily from resonance decays , 3 .",
    "they do not interact subsequent to strong interaction freeze - out  corrections for coulomb effects are often applied , 4 .",
    "kinematic correlations , e.g. , energy - momentum conservation , are of no relevance .",
    "considerable wealth of available experimental results @xcite leads us to a few conclusions of relevance to the understanding of the reaction mechanisms operating in relativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "* the nuclear collision geometry determines the source size of pions and kaons .",
    "no evidence is found for a major expansion of the hadronic fireball , required , e.g. , for a ( long lived ) mixed ( hg / qgp ) intermediate phase . *",
    "the size of the particle source is similar though a bit smaller for strange ( kaons ) than non - strange ( pions ) particles .",
    "* there is proportionality of the central hadron multiplicity yield to the geometric volume of the source .",
    "* evidence is emerging for presence of transverse flow of the particle source .",
    "these results suggest to us that after its formation the ( deconfined ) fireball expands and then rather suddenly disintegrates and hadronizes , freezing out final state particles at the very early stage of the evolution of strongly interacting matter .",
    "we now briefly survey the key properties of strange particles and mention some prototype methods for their detection . among strange baryons ( and antibaryons ) we record : + * hyperons * @xmath59 and @xmath60 comprising two types of particles , the isosinglet @xmath61 and the isotriplet @xmath62 . among the hyperons",
    "we distinguish :    @xmath11 the isospin singlet lambda @xmath63 , a neutral particle of mass 1.116 gev that decays weakly with proper path length @xmath64=7.9 cm .",
    "the dominant and commonly observed decay is @xmath65 the other important weak decay @xmath66 has only the hard to identify neutral particles in the final state .",
    "the decay of a neutral particle into a pair of charged particles forms a characteristic ` v ' structure shown in fig.[v - dec ] .",
    "aside of the ground state ( positive parity , spin 1/2 ) we encounter a spin @xmath67 resonance @xmath68 and also @xmath69 state @xmath70 .",
    "these and higher excited resonance states ( 13 are presently known with mass below 2.350 gev ) decay hadronicaly with the two principle channels : @xmath71 since the hadronic decays have free space proper decay paths of 110 fm ( widths @xmath72250 mev ) , all these resonances contribute to the abundance of the observed ` stable ' strange particles @xmath73 .",
    "the practical approach to the observation of @xmath61 is to observe the ( dominant ) decay channel with two final state charged particles pointing to a formation vertex remote from the collision vertex of projectile and target .",
    "this approach includes in certain kinematic region the events which originate from the k@xmath74 decay ( see below ) .",
    "the well established method of data analysis has been reviewed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 the isospin triplet @xmath75 of mass 1.189 gev .",
    "the decay of neutral @xmath76 occurs within @xmath77 2.22 @xmath78 cm , thus well away from the reaction region , but for the observer in the laboratory this remains indistinguishable from the interaction vertex .",
    "consequently all measurements of @xmath61 combine the abundances of @xmath61 and @xmath79 , and all the higher resonances that decay hadronicaly into @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath79 is taken to be produced with a thermally reduced rate compared to the abundance of @xmath61 : @xmath80 here the power @xmath81 depends on what precisely is measured .",
    "for example when @xmath3 stands for @xmath82 we have @xmath83 ; when this spectral distribution is integrated over a wide region of rapidity , @xmath3 stands for @xmath84 and we find @xmath85 since we have @xmath86 ( @xmath87 follows when @xmath88 ) .    as with @xmath61",
    "there are several ( nine ) heavier @xmath62 resonances known at @xmath89 gev . when produced , they all decay hadronicaly producing @xmath90    turning briefly to the charged @xmath91 we note that there is only one dominant decay channel for the @xmath92 decay : @xmath93 because there are two isospin allowed decay channels of similar strength for the @xmath94 : @xmath95 the decay path here is nearly half as long , @xmath96 cm . @xmath91",

    "these contain as inputs detailed data and their extrapolations , and often also assumptions about unknown reaction cross sections .",
    "the attainment of thermal equilibrium is in these calculations result of many individual particle - particle collisions .",
    "however , for the nucleon - nucleon ( n  n ) collisions we already know that the appearance of the thermal particle distributions in the final state is inexplicable in terms of dynamical microscopic models @xcite .",

    "the prize one pays in this approach is that under certain conditions one looses the ability to describe some details of the collision evolution . for example",
    ", we have not been able to identify within a thermal model a method to determine the stopping fractions ( i.e. , energy or baryon number deposition rate ) governing the different collisions and we extract this parameter in qualitative form from the data . in the microscopic kinetic theory models one can in principle claim to ` derive ' , e.g. , the energy - momentum stopping .",

    "it should be noted here that in a rough survey of the particle yields one aught to observe the considerable impact of the surface of the colliding nuclei , always present in symmetric systems .",
    "consequently , it is no surprise that many observed particle rapidity yields are wider than expected even in presence of full stopping  the degree of stopping reached can be more effectively explored considering the rapidity shapes of particles which can not be easily made in single hadron interactions ( e.g. , @xmath136 ) .",

    "the exponential spectral shape is relatively little deformed by resonance decay and the fireball dynamics , here in particular flow phenomena .",
    "thus this portion of the spectrum should be similar for different particles , which would allow a reduction of all data to just one basic spectral shape form : @xmath169 the parameters of each particle distribution include the inverse slope @xmath31 ( ` temperature ' ) of the @xmath17 distribution , centered around the @xmath21 .",

    "three fugacities are introduced since the flavors @xmath170 and as appropriate @xmath171 are separately conserved on the time scale of hadronic collisions and can only be produced or annihilated in particle - antiparticle pair production processes . while we explore in qualitative terms the charm production , it remains a rather small effect even at lhc energies . ] .",
    "the fugacity of each hadronic particle species is the product of the valence quark fugacities , thus , for example , the hyperons have the fugacity @xmath172 .",

    "we exploit now the above developments to obtain these results .    in fig.[sigcc ]",
    "we show the gluon and quark - pair fusion charm production cross sections , computed for the two running @xmath388 ( thick and thin solid lines ) and running charmed mass with @xmath389 mev ; dashed lines depict the light quark fusion process , noteworthy is the smallness of this cross section , due to the relatively large value of @xmath283 required , given that @xmath390 .",
    "however , we will show that one can not neglect the thermal charm production in lhc or even rhic environments , where the charm production can lead in the end to notable phase space saturation at freeze - out .",
    "the resulting thermal differential production rates @xmath318 for charm , eq.([dads ] ) , are shown in fig.[figdadsc ] .",
    "we note that the thermal charm production peaks at @xmath391 gev , near to the running mass production threshold .    the differential production rate can be easily integrated , and we show the result in fig.[figacc ] .",
    "we see that the charm production rate changes by 6 orders of magnitude as the temperature varies between 200 and 700 mev .",
    "this sensitivity on the initial temperature , while understandable due to the fact that @xmath392 , also implies that since the charm production rate is not vanishingly small , we may have found an interesting probe of the primordial high temperature phase .",
    "this was also noted in a case study performed by levai et al .",
    "note that the gluon dominance of the production rate is not as pronounced for charm as it is for strangeness because charm formation occurs near to the threshold , where the quark fusion cross section dominates . only for @xmath393 mev",
    "we find that the glue fusion dominates the thermal charm production clearly . for charm",
    "there is the possibility that the thermal production is overwhelmed by the direct production based on high energy parton interactions .",
    "calculations show @xcite that per lhc event there may be a few directly produced charm quark pairs .",
    "however , we have a differential production rate for an initial state with chemically equilibrated gluons at @xmath394 mev , @xmath395 , see fig.[figacc ] , which implies that we should expect up to 20 thermal charmed quark pairs per such event at central rapidity , which yield is clearly dominating the reported direct production rate .",
    "consequently , we continue below to evaluate in detail the evolution of thermal charm yield , which may dominate the production rate and in particular lead to rather surprising features in final particle yields , should the initial plasma temperature be sufficiently large . moreover , the rats we find for temperatures near 250 mev , seem to be still within the realm of the observable .    in fig.[figtaucc ]",
    "we show the charm relaxation constant , see eq.([tauss ] ) , using the same conventions and parameters as in fig.[figacc ] , and using @xmath396 gev in order to establish the reference density for the approach to equilibrium .",
    "actually , this running value is temperature dependent , and will be slightly smaller at higher temperatures , since the average interaction energy is greater .",
    "we will return to discuss this intricate variation at another occasion .",
    "what it implies is that at high temperatures we are ` chasing ' with the thermal rate a somewhat higher equilibrium density and thus the computed relaxation time underestimates slightly the correct result .",
    "we now can proceed to explore two generic ( strangeness ) observables as function of the impact parameter ( baryon content ) and collision energy :    * specific ( with respect to baryon number @xmath149 ) strangeness yield @xmath397 + _ once produced strangeness escapes , bound in diverse hadrons , from the evolving fireball and hence the total abundance observed is characteristic for the initial extreme conditions ; _ * phase space occupancy @xmath195 + _ strangeness freeze - out conditions at particle hadronization time @xmath398 , given the initially produced abundance , determine the final state observable phase space occupancy of strangeness @xmath151 .",
    "_    to pursue this a more specific picture of the temporal evolution is needed : in the earlier discussion in section [ tmod ] we have considered the chemical cooling @xcite due to the strangeness production .",
    "it is a rather complicated matter to account simultaneously for both the chemical cooling , and the flow cooling arising from volume expansion .",
    "we shall concentrate here on the flow cooling which dominates the evolution once strangeness reaches chemical equilibrium .",
    "we therefore denote all initial values by the subscript ` in ' in order to distinguish the here proposed schematic model from the earlier discussion of chemical cooling which is important in the early evolution stages .    in first approximation",
    ", the particle density in the fireball as taken to being constant and the sharp surface of the volume comprising the dense matter is allowed to expand in all space directions at most and probably near to maximal sound velocity @xmath399 .",
    "this value is consistent with the hydrodynamic flow studies and also leads to a doppler blue - shift factor @xmath400 of the freeze - out temperature @xmath401 mev , which is consistent with the apparent spectral temperatures , obtained from the initial temperature , see table  [ bigtable ] . onto this collective radial motion",
    "there will be superposed additional longitudinal collective motion related to the remainder of the original longitudinal momentum of the colliding particles . furthermore ,",
    "the volume and temperature temporal evolution constrained by the adiabatic evolution condition which for massless particles has the form : @xmath402 the fireball radius grows according to @xmath403 and hence from the adiabatic expansion constraint eq.([adiaex ] ) we obtain the time dependence of temperature : @xmath404    a set of initial conditions for the sps experiments follows from the kinematic constraints@xcite , see table  [ bigtable ] , consistent with global event structure , and the hadronic freeze - out condition seen in hbt experiments is @xcite : @xmath405 here the radius @xmath406 has been determined such that for the qgp equations of state we employ the baryon number content in the fireball is 380 ( pb  pb case ) and 120 ( s  pb / w case ) respectively , corresponding to zero impact parameter collisions .",
    "the energy / baryon content at given projectile energy is computed assuming that same stopping governs energy and baryon number which we take for the current discussion to be 50% for s ",
    "pb / w and 100% for pb  pb . also , we take @xmath407 as the initial strangeness abundance after 1 fm/@xmath171 .",
    "the chosen values of @xmath201 are of minimal importance , as they enter marginally into the quark - fusion rate , which is a minor contribution to the strangeness production rate .",
    "however , @xmath201 has indirect importance as it determines the initial fireball size for given @xmath149 and impacts greatly the strange particle ( baryon / antibaryon ) ratios .",
    "the most important parameter , which follows from the theoretical model developed for the collision , is the temperature @xmath408 .",
    "we use in the calculations @xmath409 as the initial strangeness occupancy factor after 1 fm/@xmath171@xcite .    from eqs.([r(t ) ] , [ t(t ) ] ) it follows that the temperature drops to the commonly accepted phase transition value @xmath401 mev @xcite at @xmath410 and 13.5 fm/@xmath171 for s ",
    "w / pb and pb  pb systems , respectively . at these instants",
    "the size of the fireball has reached 9.4 and 12.8 fm , respectively .",
    "note that some of the results shown below here were obtained with qcd parameters , @xmath252 and @xmath411 mev @xcite , other were computed with running @xmath5 with initial values as discussed , see fig.[fig - a1 ] @xcite .",
    "while these results are nearly consistent with each other , the remaining differences illustrate some of the uncertainties in our theoretical modeling of the heavy flavor production .",
    "as we have discussed in section [ secanalysis ] it is rather straightforward to extract from the strange antibaryon experimental particle yields the value of strangeness phase space occupancy @xmath153 , since the hadronization value of @xmath151 governs the ratios of particles with different strangeness content .",
    "we recall that since the thermal equilibrium is by hypothesis established within a considerably shorter time scale than the ( absolute ) heavy flavor chemical equilibration , we can characterize the saturation of the phase space by an average over the momentum distribution , see also eq.([rhos(t ) ] ) : @xmath412 where @xmath413 is the sum over all heavy flavor containing particle densities , and should multistrange / charmed objects be present , this sum contains the associated weight .",
    "@xmath414 is the same , but for the equilibrium particle densities . in qgp",
    "deconfined state , of course we have just the free quarks .",
    "when we assume that the fireball is homogeneous in @xmath31 and @xmath201 we can write : @xmath415    since @xmath251 is just of the magnitude of the life span of the deconfined state , see fig.[figtauss ] , strangeness will be close to fully saturate the final state phase - space in the qgp fireball .",
    "however , this accidental similarity of the life span of the fireball and the relaxation time of strangeness implies that changes in the collision conditions should lead to measurable changes of @xmath195 .",
    "this would be a highly desirable situation , allowing a test of the theoretical predictions .",
    "it can be expected that in the near future @xmath195 will be studied varying a number of parameters of the collision , such as the volume occupied by the fireball ( varying size of the colliding nuclei and impact parameter ) , the trigger condition ( e.g. , the inelasticity ) , the energy of colliding nuclei when searching for the threshold energy of abundant strangeness formation . we thus develop in this section a more precise understanding of the time evolution of the observed value of @xmath195 , as function of the collision parameters .",
    "this variable comprises as the dynamic element the specific strangeness yield , indeed we can easily see that : the ratio of the observed phase space occupancy @xmath151 to the specific yield @xmath397 is _ independent of the initial conditions and only dependent on the freeze - out _ : @xmath416 where @xmath417 is the equilibrium abundance of strangeness in the fireball at dissociation / freeze - out . we thus see that if we can interpret both observables @xmath151 and @xmath397 successfully , we have in all likelihood obtained a valid model both of the initial and freeze - out conditions .    similarly , as alluded to above in section [ charprod ] , the thermal charm production is sensitive to the initial temperature , but clearly the production of charmed particles will not saturate the initially available phase space .",
    "however , it is interesting to see what values of @xmath418 would be found in the final state , since the equilibrium density of charm at hadronization is very low .",
    "also here we need to consider in some more detail the temporal evolution with the plasma expansion of the off - equilibrium parameter @xmath418 .",
    "the general expression for strangeness production is given by eq.([drho / dt3 ] ) .",
    "taking the particle density everywhere in the fireball as constant , we have : @xmath419\\,.\\ ] ] the @xmath420 term arises when the back reaction , e.g. , @xmath421 is considered in the boltzmann approximation , and the unsaturated @xcite thermally equilibrated quantum bose / fermi phase space distributions are expanded : @xmath422 evaluation of relaxation constants with complete quantum phase space @xcite has not revealed any significant effects , thus boltzmann terms provide here a very good approximation .",
    "recall that the subtle difference between @xmath44 and = 13.9pt @xmath423 is that while the latter is conjugated between particles and antiparticles , see eq.([lam ] ) , @xmath44 is the same for particles and antiparticles .",
    "equivalently , one can introduce different chemical potentials for particles and antiparticles , as was the case in ref.@xcite    it is common practice to illustrate the impact of volume expansion dilution to write @xmath424 which when inserted on the left hand side of eq.([dnsdt ] ) leads to : @xmath425\\,.\\ ] ] the second term on the left hand side is referred to as the volume dilution term .    in order to obtain a dilution equation for @xmath195 , let us instead proceed , using in eq.([dnsdt ] ) the definition of @xmath195 in the form : @xmath426 note that when dividing eq.([ndef ] ) by @xmath427 we recover our earlier definitions of @xmath195 , see eqs.([rhos(t ) ] , [ gamdef2 ] ) .    inserting eq.([ndef ] ) into eq.([dnsdt ] ) we obtain : @xmath428 it is noteworthy that @xmath429 , the final total abundance of particles , as given in eq.([nsinfty ] ) , changes only slowly in time when the volume and temperature temporal evolution is governed by the adiabatic evolution condition , eq.([adiaex ] ) .",
    "thus the logarithmic derivative in the dilution term in eq.([dnsdtinf ] ) is in many cases very small since : @xmath430 what we see happening is that the volume dilution seen in eq.([dnsdtbis ] ) is nearly completely compensated by the dilution of the value of @xmath431 in presence of adiabatic cooling .",
    "= 13.5pt in many cases it is sufficient to study an approximate solution of eq.([dnsdtinf ] ) .",
    "for @xmath432 we have @xmath433const . ,",
    "and hence we have the analytical solution : @xmath434 where the semi - convergent approximation for the dominant gluon fusion term has been used in the past@xcite : @xmath435 in order to argue that the value of @xmath195 in many cases of interest approaches unity .",
    "but the approximate solution , eq.([dgamsmallx ] ) , presumes that the final freeze - out occurs such that @xmath436 , which condition is not fulfilled if the plasma hadronizes at temperatures of the magnitude @xmath437 mev as seems to be the case today for the baryon rich plasma , see our discussion in section [ results ] and the results of lattice gauge simulations of qcd @xcite .",
    "we will now show numerically that major deviations from the approximate solution arise and in particular @xmath195 can easily become much greater than unity , depending on the precise value of the freeze - out temperature . to see this note that a slight rearrangement of eq.([dnsdtinf ] ) leads to the form : @xmath438\\right)\\,,\\ ] ] which shows that even when @xmath439 we still can have a positive derivative of @xmath195 , since the first term on the right hand side of eq.([dgdtf ] ) is always positive , both @xmath440 and @xmath441 being always negative .",
    "note that @xmath442 becomes small when @xmath31 drops below @xmath364 and whence the dilution term dominates the evolution of @xmath195 .      the numerical integration of eq.([dgdtf ] ) is now possible , up to the point at which the plasma phase ceases to exist or / and the final state strange particles are emitted . according to our hypothesis , which leads to a successful interpretation of the experimental data , the abundances of rarely produced strange ( anti)baryons is not further affected by subsequent evolution .",
    "we present @xmath443 for the case of s ",
    "w / pb collisions ( dashed lines ) and pb  pb collisions ( solid lines ) , in fig.[figvarsgam]*a * as function of final time and in fig.[figvarsgam]*b * as function of final temperature .",
    "we note that for 8 fm / c we obtain the observed value @xmath444 for the s ",
    "w / pb collisions . however , this time is associated with a low final temperature of @xmath445 mev , as can be deduced from the result shown in fig.[figvarsgam]*b*. taking the final temperature value to be @xmath446 mev for the s ",
    "w / pb case , one arrives at @xmath447 .",
    "this is slightly less than the experimental result @xmath444 which suggests that our ideal flow temporal evolution model may be leading to a too fast cooling or / and that the perturbative estimate of the strangeness production rate is a bit too low  to reach exact agreement between experiment and theory we would need a cumulative change in these two here relevant quantities ( flow velocity and qgp - strangeness production rate ) of magnitude 20% .",
    "there is clearly plenty of room for an improvement of this magnitude in both these quantities .    when considering the pb ",
    "pb collisions we are primarily interested to find if it is likely that we reach @xmath448 . for this to occur , our results , see fig.[figvarsgam ] , suggest that the final qgp fireball temperature should be lower than 160 mev .",
    "note that allowing for the above discussed likely further increase in production rate and/or reduction in flow , pushes this temperature limit to 210 mev .",
    "we thus can be practically certain that in pb ",
    "pb collisions at 158a gev one observes @xmath449 with the associated interesting consequences for strange particle abundances ( see section [ results ] ) .    to study the dependence on the impact parameter on strangeness saturation , we vary the magnitude of the initial fireball size @xmath450 . from geometric considerations",

    "however , for larger impact parameters ( small fireball sizes ) the actual momentum stopping is reduced and thus the heating and compression of the fireball is less than we have implicitly assumed using a constant value for @xmath408 for different initial fireball volumes .",
    "it is impossible for us to improve on this hypothesis here , since this requires the understanding of the hadronic matter stopping as function of the amount of hadronic matter involved . with this set of initial conditions we integrate the dynamical equation ( [ dgdtf ] ) for @xmath195 up to final temperature @xmath446 mev ( see discussion below in section [ hadromod ] ) for the 200a gev s  w / pb collisions .",
    "we find that full strangeness phase space saturation occurs for fireballs with a radius @xmath455 fm , which includes impacts parameters @xmath451 up to about 3 - 4 fm .",
    "this result suggests that there is no need to trigger onto very central collisions in order to observe @xmath456 .",
    "moreover , the relatively sudden onset of the phase space saturation seen in fig.[gammasr]*a * as function of fireball size is very probably even more sudden , had we incorporated the changing stopping related to the change of volume .",

    "pb collision energy .",
    "we obtain this result by varying the initial fireball temperature @xmath408 and relating this value to the specific energy content in the fireball by the results given in fig.[fig1s95 ]  we take here the result we obtained for full stopping @xmath205 . recall that baryon and energy stopping being equal",

    "we recall that our study of the s ",
    "pb collision system suggests somewhat more effective chemical equilibration , thus the small variation of @xmath195 with energy reported here may be even less pronounced . on the other hand this small variation impacts the final particle yields as we shall see in section [ results ] , in that it makes relative yields of strange antibaryons such as @xmath463 nearly independent of collision energy .",
    "we can now briefly return to the discussion of the result of the na35 collaboration@xcite shown in fig.[lbpbna35 ] : despite the large error bar it is noticeable that there is a tendency for the @xmath165-ratio to increase as the collision system becomes smaller .",

    "it is not anymore impossible to imagine that the combination of initial and disintegration conditions of these two systems reverses the naive expectations regarding the final observable values of @xmath195 , leading to a greater value for the smaller system .",
    "we now explore the saturation of the charmed quark phase space in conditions sensible for the forthcoming rhic and lhc environments .",
    "we consider the temporal evolution for the initial temperature 500 mev . due the to likely dominance of the expansion by the longitudinal flow we take for the adiabatic condition the relation @xmath467 const .",

    "is small , being very slow , but because the freeze - out temperature should here also be taken in the vicinity of 150 mev , the phase space occupancy reaches a stunning value _ exceeding unity_. still greater values result for higher initial temperatures and/or lower freeze - out temperatures .",
    "we note that the discussion of thermal charm production in this language makes only sense if the number of charmed quark pairs produced in the initial moments is considerably greater than unity .",

    "we note that there is at most one non - trivial real solution of eq.([zero ] ) for monotonous arguments of @xmath503 , and only when this argument is greater than unity .    clearly , the observation @xcite of @xmath504 is , in view of the accidental nature of this value in the confined phase , a rather strong indication for the direct formation of final state hadrons from a deconfined phase . in such a process",
    "the particle abundances retain memory of the chemical ( fugacity ) parameters , the conservation of strangeness and other properties is assured by the ( non - equilibrium hadronic gas ) abundance numbers of the particles produced .",
    "for example the number of baryons emitted even at very low temperatures must remain conserved and thus can not be tiny despite the thermal suppression factor @xmath505  a big change in chemical potentials would require lengthy reequilibration .",
    "these effects are absent since @xmath203 , at least in the strangeness chemical potential : for the s ",

    "we can thus safely conclude that strange particles produced in 200a gev sulphur interactions with diverse targets indicate a particle source which displays a symmetry in phase space size of strange and antistrange particles , which fact is more than just an accident of parameters considering that it appears for two widely different collision systems , s  s and s  w / pb . a natural explanation is that such a source is deconfined , and that it disintegrates so rapidly , that its properties remain preserved in emitted strange particles .",
    "it will be very interesting to see , if this behavior will be confirmed in the pb ",
    "pb system , with present experiments operating at 158a gev and possibly later at different collision energies .",
    "we now explore the values of the parameter @xmath506 .",

    "the physical observable which we find to be primarily sensitive to the parameter @xmath506 , and to a lesser degree to the other thermal model parameters , is the kaon to hyperon abundance ratio at fixed @xmath17 : @xmath517 when computing this ratio , we have incorporated the decay pattern of all listed resonances numerically and included the descendants of strong and weak decays in order to facilitate comparison below with experimental data . in fig.[rcfreeze ] we show @xmath518 as function of @xmath506 for @xmath519 , with the same line conventions as in the fig.[f2freeze ] .",
    "we assumed that the distribution of parent particles for kaons and hyperons is according to the thermal equilibrium condition evaluated at temperature implied by fig.[f2freeze ] .",
    "there is no officially reported value for the @xmath520 ratio .",
    "however , wa85 collaboration@xcite has presented results for the yields of @xmath521 and @xmath522 obtained in s  w collisions at 200a gev , shown here in fig.[specwa85 ] , in the interval @xmath523 gev for the central rapidity region @xmath524 .",

    "the equilibrium hg source with @xmath528 ( @xmath529 ) is experimentally completely excluded .",
    "the factor @xmath530 confirms the expectation that these strange particles are produced in non - equilibrium processes  in our model they originate from directly disintegrating qgp fireball .",
    "strangeness conservation constraint fixes the freeze - out condition at @xmath531  mev .",
    "the final issue is how , from the value @xmath532 , we can infer the values of the abundance constants @xmath533 and @xmath534 which ( see eqs.([4a ] , [ rsc ] ) ) express the relative strange meson and baryon production abundance to the thermal equilibrium values .",
    "if we argue that the strange meson abundance , akin to total meson abundance is enhanced by factor two ( i.e. , @xmath535 ) as we found studying the entropy enhancement @xcite , then the conclusion would be that the strange baryons are enhanced ( against their tiny hg equilibrium abundance at @xmath536 mev ) by the factor @xmath537 .",
    "we thus see that the hadronization abundance of mesons is enhanced by factor 2 and that of baryons by factor @xmath538 compared to the yields that would be expected from a chemically equilibrated hg phase dissociating at about @xmath539 mev .",
    "clearly , one of the important aspects of this result is the relation of the meson enhancement factor to entropy production in heavy ion collision , and we briefly recapitulate the situation which lead to the expected enhancement of meson yield .",
    "= 12.7pt    one of the fundamental differences between the qgp and the conventional hagedorn type hadron gas ( hg ) structure of the fireball , is the specific entropy content per baryon ( @xmath222 ) evaluated at some given ( measured ) values of statistical parameters .",
    "this entropy content can be determined in terms of the final state particle multiplicity .",
    "however , in the central rapidity region only few experiments have been able to obtain a full phase space coverage . because of the need to observe relatively small momentum particles , this is a particularly difficult experimental task and at present the best experimental access to this issue is by means of emulsion techniques .",
    "we present here one set of preliminary experimental results which give already a pretty good representation of the specific entropy content in the fireball .",
    "the emu05 collaboration@xcite has studied s ",
    "pb collision at 200 gev a using a thin pb - foil placed in front of a emulsion stack .",
    "they have concentrated the analysis on central collision events requiring a total final state charged multiplicity to be greater than 300 , corresponding to a total central particle multiplicity between 4501000 .",
    "they present the multiplicities per interval in rapidity , separately for positive and negative particles . from these data",
    ", one can determine the number of protons in the central fireball @xmath540 this gives a baryonic number of the fireball @xmath149 nearly equal to 60 and corresponds to a stopping @xmath541 50% for the participant nucleons , the reference value being obtained from the geometric tube - like interaction region model , in this case : @xmath542 if we take for the entropy per particle the thermal value for an isolated system of massless particles @xmath543 , ( in fact at high @xmath31 for massive hadrons @xmath544 is @xmath545 ) , we obtain taking the full multiplicity @xmath546 : @xmath547 a more precise analysis of this experiment can be perform by starting from the ratio : @xmath548 which is found in this experiment to be @xmath549 in the central region ( see fig.[fig1entro ] ) .",
    "we note that in the numerator of @xmath550 the charge of particle pairs produced cancels and hence this value is effectively a measure of the baryon number , but there is a significant correction arising from the presence of strange particles .",
    "the denominator is a measure of the total multiplicity  its value is different before or after disintegration of the produced unstable hadronic resonances .",
    "using as input the distribution of final state particles as generated within the hadron gas final state it is found @xcite that @xmath551 is nearly independent of the thermal parameters and varies between 4.8 , before disintegration of the resonances , to 3 after disintegration ( see fig.[fig2entro ] ) .",
    "it is less than clear that the conservative assumption of the hadronic gas final state is justified , and if we were to assume that , e.g. , the deconfined state is hadronizing into the final hadronic particles suddenly , production of resonances would be largely suppressed , and thus the greater value 4.8 would apply . using the above value of @xmath552 we find for the entropy per baryon of the final state we obtain for the entropy content of the emulsion events analyzed by emu05 : @xmath553 with the upper limit applying in the case that few heavy meson resonances are produced .",
    "we recall that in table  [ sollresult1 ] we have listed in the bottom entry the entropy content of the final state in different hadronization scenarios .",
    "these are the chemical equilibrium results ( except for strangeness flavor ) for the hadronic gas formed at the given statistical conditions .",
    "we note that low temperature hadronization scenario appears to be consistent with the constraints of the emu05 experiments .",
    "hadronization at these conditions can not , however , be considered seriously to lead to chemically equilibrated meson and baryon abundances , since the observed final state meson abundance in on average 50% greater than the equilibrium hg value @xcite .",
    "several features of final state particle abundances thus suggest that the dissociation of the fireball of dense hadronic matter is not leading to chemical equilibrium abundances of final state particles  this is consistent with the sudden ` explosion ' picture of this process we are employing .",
    "it should be clearly observed at this point that the presence of the high entropy phase precludes a reaction picture of relativistic heavy ion collisions based on conventional thermal hadron gas and adiabatic fireball evolution : the observed high inverse transverse mass slope @xmath554 mev in s  w interactions at 200a gev implies a initial specific entropy content ( see also table  [ sollresult1 ] ) which is 1/3 of the final state value .",
    "such a state would have to undergo very entropy generating expansion , and to best of our knowledge there is no experimental evidence for this , nor is there a suggestion of a mechanism that could accomplish such a task . on the other hand , we find that the entropy content of a dense hot qgp fireball formed at the required chemical conditions and later evolving adiabatically ( see table [ bigtable ] ) just corresponds to the expected value of specific entropy .",
    "this allows to conclude that the only currently known reaction picture of relativistic heavy ions involves formation of the thermal qgp fireball .",
    "= 12.9pt in our model of thermal fireball evolution the excess entropy is present in the early formation stage of the fireball , and as discussed , the mechanisms of ( rapid ) entropy formation are not understood .",

    "this result was obtained wit the hypothesis @xmath556 we observe the considerable drop in temperature from the initial stage to the freeze - out point . _",
    "a contrario _ , the entropy content which determines the final particle multiplicities evolves very little and 70% of the entropy is already present when quarks and gluons are still far from the equilibrium abundance .",
    "practically all the rise in entropy is due to the formation of the strange flavor ( 20% ) , the remaining 10% arise as consequence of the slight change in the value of @xmath201 given that we enforce during the collision period the condition of dynamical pressure equilibrium",
    ".      the ratios of strange baryon to strange antibaryon abundance , considering the same type of particles , depends only on the chemical properties of the source .",
    "we show in fig.[eqratios ] the three ratios and also @xmath557 .",
    "since we assume @xmath203 , we obtain here in particular @xmath558 .",
    "however , since some re - equilibration is to be expected towards the hg behavior @xmath559 , we expect @xmath560 , with @xmath561 small , and thus for this ratio @xmath562 .",
    "+    = 12.5pt an interesting question which arises quite often is how the individual particle and in particular total antibaryon yields vary with energy .",
    "eq.([4a ] ) allows to determine the absolute particle yields as function of fireball energy .",
    "considerable uncertainty is arising from the off - equilibrium nature of the hadronization process , which in particular makes it hard to estimate how the different heavy particle resonances are populated , and also , how the abundance factors @xmath563 vary as function of energy .",
    "some of this uncertainties are eliminated when we normalize the yields at an energy , which we take here to be the value @xmath216 gev which is applicable to the sps experiments . in fig.[plyieldsnorm ] the so normalized yields of antibaryons taking the freeze - out temperature @xmath564 mev are shown ( we also assume @xmath565 and absence of any re - equilibration after particle emission / production ) .",
    "these yields are decreasing in qualitatively similar systematic fashion with energy , as would be expected from the microscopic considerations , but the decrease of more strange antibaryons is less pronounced .",
    "the quantitative point to note is that at ags ( @xmath566 gev ) the yield from a disintegrating qgp - fireball is a factor 100400 smaller compared to yields at @xmath5678.6 gev . since the particle rapidity density @xmath568 is not that much smaller at the lower energies ( recall that the specific entropy , see  table [ bigtable ] , drops only by factor 3.5 , implying a reduction in specific multiplicity by a factor 5 ) , it is considerably more difficult at the lower energies to search for antibaryons than it is at higher energies",
    ". we should remember that the results presented in fig.[plyieldsnorm ] are obtained assuming formation of the qgp - fireball and same freeze - out and hadronization conditions for all energies shown .",
    "we have obtained the result presented in fig.[plyieldsnorm ] assuming that the strange phase space saturation is given by the dynamical evolution of a three dimensional radial expansion and freeze - out at @xmath437 mev .",
    "our result was that all particle yields behave in the same qualitative fashion , with the curves falling nearly directly on top of each other .",
    "this implies , as we shall see in more detail below , that in a dynamical calculation there is very little , if any variability in particle ratios with energy .",
    "we next present the particle ratio results assuming first @xmath448 , and we turn to consider the variation of @xmath195 with energy below .",
    "the choice @xmath448 is appropriate if we had a relatively large , long - lived qgp fireball created in central collisions of largest available nuclei , or if our computation of the variation of @xmath195 with energy was underestimating strongly the actual production rates . in the figs.[barlp][barox ]",
    "we show three ratios and for each ratio three results : solid lines depicts the result for the full phase space coverage , short dashed line for particles with @xmath158 gev and long dashed line for particles with @xmath569 gev . in fig.[barlp ] we show the ratio @xmath165 , in fig.[barxl ] the ratio @xmath570 and in fig.[barox ] the ratio @xmath571 . because @xmath201 rises with decreasing @xmath221 and we have kept @xmath572",
    ", we find that these three ratios increase quite strongly _ as the collision energy is reduced_.    the behavior of particle ratios shown in figs.[barlp][barox ] may be of considerable importance , since in reaction models in which qgp is not assumed and the particles are made in a sequence of microscopic collisions these ratios _ do increase _ from production thresholds with the collision energy , reflecting in this behavior the phase space factors inherent in the reaction cross section .",
    "= 12.9pt we now directly compare our theoretical results with the experimental data we have reported in section [ expres ] : the wa85 @xmath573 production ratio obtained for the s - w at 200a gev @xcite ; the @xmath165 ratio of the na35 collaboration obtained for the s  au system at 200a gev @xcite .",
    "fig.[sratios ] shows a comparison of our ab initio calculation and the pertinent experimental results .",
    "we use the same cuts on the range of @xmath160 as in the experiment : the experimental points show the results @xmath574 ( na35 ) for full phase space , @xmath575 ( wa85 ) for @xmath576 gev ; and @xmath577 ( wa85 ) for @xmath578 gev .",
    "the values @xmath579 and @xmath580 also bring about good agreement of our model with the precise value of @xmath570 .",
    "fig.[sratios ] shows also the impact of the change of the collision energy on these results , using 50% stopping , rather than @xmath205 used in figs.[barlp][barox ] .",
    "we can conclude that the fact that the two ratio @xmath165 ( na35 ) and @xmath581 ( wa85 ) are satisfactorily explained , provides a very nice confirmation of the consistency of the thermal qgp fireball model .",
    "moreover , considering that we have now the power to compute without ad hoc assumptions within the framework of dynamical model , it is quite remarkable that such a good agreement with the two very recent results could be attained .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that even when we incorporate in these strange antibaryon ratios in figs.[barlp][barox ] the variation of @xmath195 shown in fig.[gammasr ] , with considerable decrease of @xmath195 with decreasing energy ( here shown as function of lab energy in the collision , ( logarithmic scale ) , we still retain the remarkable behavior that the ratios do not decrease significantly with decreasing energy down to the energy thresholds for the production of the ( multi)strange ( anti)baryons .",
    "there can be little doubt that if this behavior should be observed down to some low energy in heavy ion collisions , and subsequently a sudden drop should occur , we could safely conclude about a change in the reaction scenario , and probably even pinpoint the mechanisms presented here as being at the origin of this result .",
    "finally , let us redraw some of the above results in fig.[figvarelab ] as function of the beam energy , for the central collisions of symmetric ( pb  pb , au ",

    "we present @xmath582 used in fig.[stratiogam ] , which depends as discussed on both the initial production and the enrichment of the strange phase space occupancy by the dilution effect , and thus on freeze - out conditions , here assumed to occur at @xmath478  mev .",
    "high values of @xmath195 should accompany low freeze - out temperature , provided that there has been extreme initial conditions allowing to produce strangeness . to the right we present the specific strangeness yield .",
    "we recall that for s  ag collisions at 200a gev a recent evaluation of the strangeness yield leads to @xmath583 ( see table  4 of ref.@xcite ) which fits also nicely into the range of values shown at 200 gev in fig.[figvarelab ] .",
    "while it is today impossible , based solely on current experimental results , to claim that the ` macroscopic ' , deconfined qcd - phase has been discovered in the 200a gev collisions , we have developed the experimental and theoretical strangeness tools which allow to resolve in the foreseeable future this question .",
    "today , we can affirm that the natural hypothesis of a qgp - fireball provides us within the thermal fireball model with a very comprehensive and satisfactory explanation of all available experimental data both at 200a gev and 10 - 15a gev . while the lower energy is also well described by the hg type models , the 200a gev results are incompatible with an assumed hg structure of the interacting hadronic matter in the thermal fireball , or cascades of conventional hadrons studied in transport approaches @xcite .",
    "we have described in detail how production and final state manifestation of strangeness in antibaryon yields , can help today to identify and study the properties of the deconfined phase .",
    "our exploration of thermal charm production has shown that open charm could become an interesting probe of initial conditions reached at lhc energies .",
    "we have shown that the experimental results suggest that the thermal ( kinetic ) equilibrium is established , while the chemical ( particle abundance ) equilibrium in the processes governing final state particle freeze - out is not achieved in 200a gev collisions .",
    "motivated by the absence of chemical particle abundance equilibrium , we developed and used here a picture of final state hadron production which involves rapid disintegration of the qgp - fireball .",
    "central to the particle abundances are then the chemical properties of the qgp - fireball and we have discussed these comprehensively as function of collision energy and stopping .    we have shown how a kinetic reaction picture model allows to determine the thermal conditions reached in high density deconfined matter created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is based on the observation that during the collision the compression of the quark - gluon matter can proceed until the internal pressure exerts sufficiently strong counter force .",
    "using so established initial conditions and adiabatic fireball expansion , we have shown that the thermal conditions we find at the end of the evolution , see bottom of table  [ bigtable ] , are in good agreement with our expectations derived from particle yields seen in s ",

    "as expected we found that the large strangeness abundance produced in the early stages will not be reannihilated .",
    "we presented the yields as function of both , the collision energy and number of participating baryons ( impact parameter ) .",
    "we saw that the yield is rising linearly with the cm - energy per baryon , and that as far as data is available , it is in excellent agreement with the 200a gev experiment s  ag @xcite .",
    "we also explored in detail the evolution of the strangeness phase space occupancy .",
    "strangeness can overpopulate the available phase space at plasma disintegration at low freeze - out temperatures , and thus strange antibaryon abundances could show @xmath587 , even though our reaction picture leads to values @xmath456  as this discussion shows , @xmath195 is a sensitive probe of both the initial , and final freeze - out conditions .",
    "the last figures shown above in many ways are fruit of the many individual developments we presented here .",
    "the computation of relative strange antibaryon yields shown in fig.[stratiogam ] was done without ad hoc parameters but there remains some uncertainty about @xmath588 and the reaction mechanism , here in particular stopping fraction @xmath41 .",
    "this result is special as it shows that the strange antibaryon ratio as the energy of the interaction is reduced , but deconfined phase still reached , is at worse slightly declining , but still anomalously large at ags ( 10a gev ) or at minimal energies reachable at sps ( 40a gev ) .",
    "this justifies an exploration of the energy behavior of this central rapidity observable .",
    "similar comments apply to the less directly measured observables , the freeze - out strangeness occupancy @xmath151 and the specific strangeness yield , shown above in fig.[figvarelab ] .",
    "in particular the large strangeness yield deserves attention , which as we noted earlier is essentially linearly proportional to the available cm - energy in the fireball .",
    "our results overall imply that in key features the strange particle production results obtained at 200a gev , are consistent with the qgp hypothesis of the central , thermal fireball . however , in order to ascertain the possibility that indeed the qgp phase is already formed at 200a gev a more systematic exploration as function of collision energy of these observables would be needed  conclusions drawn from a small set of experimental results suffer from the possibility that some coincidental and unknown features in the reaction mechanisms could simulate just the observed qgp - like properties .",
    "it is highly unlikely that this would remain the case , should a key feature such as collision energy be varied .",
    "we stress that our description and hence the anomalous behavior of particle production discussed here is based on collective mechanisms ( qgp - fireball ) , which is intrinsically different from microscopic approaches , in particular when these are based on a hadronic cascade picture .",
    "we hope to have conveyed to the reader the reason why we firmly believe , considering the results we have reported , that experimental data on strange ( anti)baryon production provides the best hadronic signatures , and diagnostic tools , of the deconfined matter .",

    "<S> after a brief survey of the remarkable accomplishments of the current heavy ion collision experiments up to 200a gev , we address in depth the role of strange particle production in the search for new phases of matter in these collisions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that the observed enhancement pattern of otherwise rarely produced multistrange antibaryons can be consistently explained assuming color deconfinement in a localized , rapidly disintegrating hadronic source . </S>",
    "<S> we develop the theoretical description of this source , and in particular study qcd based processes of strangeness production in the deconfined , thermal quark - gluon plasma phase , allowing for approach to chemical equilibrium and dynamical evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we also address thermal charm production . using a rapid hadronization model </S>",
    "<S> we obtain final state particle yields , providing detailed theoretical predictions about strange particle spectra and yields as function of heavy ion energy . </S>",
    "<S> our presentation is comprehensive and self - contained : we introduce in considerable detail the procedures used in data interpretation , discuss the particular importance of selected experimental results and show how they impact the theoretical developments . </S>",
