    "the unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution of _ chandra  _ has been utilized by wang _",
    "et al . _   ( 2002 ; hereafter w02 ) and muno _ et al . _   ( 2003 ; hereafter m03 ) to investigate the x - ray source population of the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "the w02 acis - i survey of the central 0.8@xmath0@xmath12@xmath0of the gc revealed a large population of previously undiscovered discrete weak sources with x - ray luminosities of @xmath2@xmath3erg@xmath3s@xmath4 .",
    "m03 imaged the central 40 pc@xmath5 ( at 8 kpc ) around sgr a * ( fig .",
    "1a ) , finding an additional @xmath62300 discrete point sources down to a limiting flux of @xmath7 erg / s .",
    "some individual sources have been identified as x - ray transients , high - mass stars , lmxbs , and cvs . however , the nature of the majority of these newly detected sources is as yet unknown .",
    "we have undertaken an ir and x - ray observational campaign to determine the nature of the faint discrete x - ray source population discovered by _",
    "chandra  _ in the gc .",
    "data obtained to date includes a deep _",
    "chandra  _ survey of the nuclear bulge ; deep , high resolution ir imaging from vlt / isaac , ctio / ispi , and the ukidss galactic plane survey ; and ir spectroscopy from vlt / isaac and irtf / spex . by cross - correlating the x - ray imaging with our ir surveys ,",
    "we initially identify candidate counterparts to the x - ray sources via astrometry . using a detailed ir extinction map",
    ", we are deriving magnitudes and colours for all the candidates .",
    "having thus established a target list , we will use the multi - object ir spectrograph flamingos-2 on gemini south to carry out a spectroscopic survey of the candidates , to search for the emission lines which are a hallmark of accreting binaries . by determining the nature of these sources",
    ", this flamingos-2 galactic center survey will have a dramatic impact on our knowledge of the galactic accreting binary population .",
    "we have cross - correlated the source catalog derived from the w02 _ chandra  _ survey with @xmath8images of 26 selected 2.5@xmath5 regions obtained with isaac on the vlt to identify candidate ir counterparts to the x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "ir spectroscopy to search for accretion signatures will be required for definitive identifications . using this technique",
    ", we were able to conclusively identify the ir counterpart to `` edd-1 '' , one of these newly discovered low - luminosity x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "cross - correlation of our ctio ispi @xmath8image ( fig .",
    "1b ) of the central 10 pc@xmath5 of the gc with the deep sgr a * image of m03 is underway ; this will produce a large number of ir candidate counterparts to the x - ray sources .",
    "due to the extremely high stellar density in the nuclear bulge , many of these astrometric `` matches '' are likely to be chance superpositions . with thousands of candidate counterparts , traditional long - slit single - target spectroscopy",
    "would be a prohibitively inefficient method by which to identify true counterparts .",
    "thus we will need to follow - up with multi - object ir spectroscopy to find the true matches : this is the work which will be performed with the flamingos-2 galactic center survey ( f2gcs ) .",
    "[ fig : sub : a ] [ fig : sub : b ]",
    "we find that the ir extinction in the gc can vary on scales as small as 5   ( 0.2 - 0.6 pc at 8 kpc ; @xcite ) . some areas show little evidence of this `` granularity '' , while others are highly structured .",
    "to obtain reddening - corrected stellar photometry , a local value for the @xmath8extinction ( on scales @xmath9 ) must be measured and applied .",
    "the relationship of extinction to wavelength in the ir is a power law with slope @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the `` canonical '' value for @xmath10 is @xmath62 ( _ e.g .  _",
    "@xcite ) . in contrast , for the gc we find a mean value of @xmath11 ; and furthermore , along any given line of sight to the gc @xmath10 varies substantially , ranging from @xmath61.83.6 @xcite .",
    "thus we find that the `` universal '' ir extinction law is _ not _ universal in the gc !",
    "[ fig : sub : a ] [ fig : sub : b ]    the united kingdom infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) is an imaging survey covering 7500@xmath0@xmath5 of the northern sky using a wide - field ir camera ( wfcam ) on ukirt . the galactic plane survey ( gps ) component of ukidss covers the nuclear bulge ( -2@xmath0@xmath1215@xmath0 , @xmath132@xmath0 ) to a depth of @xmath8@xmath618 with a resolution of @xmath60.8   @xcite .",
    "we have obtained an additional 600 ksec of _ chandra  _ observations of the central degree of the gc ; cross - correlation of the resultant x - ray source catalog , combined with the earlier w02 and m03 datasets , with the ukidss gps imaging of the gc ( fig .",
    "2a ) will provide additional targets for the f2gcs . with the ukidss gps data we can also map the 1 - 2 @xmath14 m `` granularity '' in the gc ( fig .",
