    "recent observational studies of globular clusters ( gcs ) in clusters of galaxies have suggested that there can be a population of gcs that are bounded by cluster gravitational potentials rather than those of cluster member galaxies ( e.g. , west et al .",
    "1995 ; bassino et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ; jordn et al .",
    "2003 ) , though the existence of these intracluster gcs ( icgcs ) in the coma cluster is observationally suggested to be highly unlikely ( e.g. , marn - franch & aparicio 2003 ) .",
    "structural and kinematical studies of a population of very bright star clusters @xmath1 known as `` ultra - compact dwarfs ( ucds ) '' @xmath1 have also suggested that these clusters can be also freely floating intracluster objects ( mieske et al .",
    "2004 ; drinkwater et al . 2005 ; jones et al . 2005 ) .",
    "physical properties of intracluster stellar objects such as icgcs and pne are considered to be sensitive to dark matter properties and cluster - related physical processes ( e.g. , tidal stripping of gcs and hierarchical growth of clusters ) and thus provide some fossil information on formation of galaxies and clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , arnaboldi 2004 for a recent review ) .",
    "although there have been developments on the observational front , there has been little theoretical and numerical works carried out as to how icgcs are formed in clusters environments ( e.g. , forte et al .",
    "1982 ; muzzio et al .",
    "1987 ; bekki et al .",
    "these previous models showed that tidal stripping of gcs from cluster member galaxies though galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - cluster interaction is a mechanism for icgc formation .",
    "these previous works however used _ fixed _",
    "gravitational potentials of already virialized clusters and accordingly could not discuss _ how icgcs in a cluster are formed as the cluster grows through hierarchical merging of smaller groups and clusters .",
    "_ thus it remains unclear ( 1 ) how icgc are formed under the currently favored cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory of galaxy formation and ( 2 ) what physical properties icgcs can have if their formation is closely associated with hierarchical formation of clusters .",
    "the purpose of this letter is thus to demonstrate , for the first time , how icgcs are formed during hierarchical formation of clusters of galaxies , based on high - resolution cosmological simulations that can follow both hierarchical growth of clusters through merging of smaller subhalos and dynamical evolution of old gcs .",
    "we also discuss physical properties of gcs that were formed within subhalos at @xmath0 yet are not within any virialized halos at @xmath2 : these gcs can be regarded as `` intergalactic '' ( van den bergh 1958 ) or `` intercluster '' gcs . for convenience and clarity , gcs within any virialized halos with the masses larger than @xmath3",
    "are refereed to as halo globular clusters ( hgcs ) and the meanings of these acronym are given in table 1 .",
    "we simulate the large scale structure of gcs in a @xmath4cdm universe with @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 km @xmath8 @xmath9 , and @xmath10 by using the adaptive mesh refinement @xmath11body code developed by yahagi ( 2005 ) and yahagi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which is a vectorized and parallelized version of the code described in yahagi & yoshii ( 2001 ) .",
    "we use @xmath12 collisionless dark matter ( dm ) particles in a simulation with the box size of @xmath13mpc and the total mass of @xmath14 .",
    "we start simulations at @xmath15 and follow it till @xmath2 in order to investigate physical properties of old gcs outside and inside virialized dark matter halos at @xmath2 .",
    "we used the cosmics ( cosmological initial conditions and microwave anisotropy codes ) , which is a package of fortran programs for generating gaussian random initial conditions for nonlinear structure formation simulations ( bertschinger 1995 , 2001 ) .",
    "the way of investigating gc properties is described as follows .",
    "firstly we select virialized dark matter subhalos at @xmath16 by using the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm ( davis et al .",
    "1985 ) with a fixed linking length of 0.2 times the mean dm particle separation .",
    "the minimum particle number @xmath17 for halos is set to be 10 . for each individual virialized subhalo with the half - mass radius of @xmath18 , some fraction ( @xmath19 ) of particles within @xmath20 are labeled as `` gc '' particles .",
    "this procedure for defining gc particles is based on the assumption that energy dissipation via radiative cooling allows baryon to fall into the deepest potential well of dark - matter halos and finally to be converted into gcs .",
    "the value of the truncation radius ( @xmath21 = @xmath20 ) is chosen , because the size of the very old gcs in the galactic gc system ( i.e. , the radius within which most galactic old gcs are located ) is similar to @xmath20 of the dark matter halo in the dynamical model of the galaxy ( bekki et al .",
    "we assume that old , metal - poor globular cluster formation is truncated after @xmath16 , because previous theoretical studies demonstrated that such truncation of gc formation by some physical mechanisms ( e.g. , reionization ) is necessary for explaining the color bimodality of gcs , very high specific frequency ( @xmath22 ) in cluster es , and structural properties of the galactic old stars and gcs ( e.g. , beasley et al . 2002 ; santos 2003 ; bekki 2005 ; bekki & chiba 2005 ) .    secondly we follow the dynamical evolution of gc particles formed before @xmath16 till @xmath2 and thereby derive locations ( @xmath23 ) and velocities ( @xmath24 ) of gcs at @xmath2 .",
    "we then identify virialized halos at @xmath2 with the fof algorithm and investigate whether each of gcs is within the halos .",
    "if a gc is found to be within a halo , the mass of the host halo ( @xmath25 ) and the distance of the gc from the center of the halo ( @xmath26 ) are investigated .",
    "if a gc is not in any halos , it is regarded as an ingc and the distance ( @xmath27 ) between the ingc and the nearest neighbor halo and the mass of the halo ( @xmath28 ) are investigated .",
    "if a gc is found to be within a cluster - size halo ( @xmath29 ) , we investigate which galaxy - scale halo in the cluster - scale halo contains the gc .",
    "we examine local mass densities around particles in a cluster and thereby select galaxy - scale halos that have high densities enough to be identified as galaxy - scale halos ( by ) .",
    "if we find the gc within the tidal radius ( @xmath30 ) of one of galaxy - scale halos in the cluster - scale halo , it is regarded as a galactic gc ( ggc ) : otherwise it is regarded as an icgc .",
    "@xmath30 is assumed to be the radius where the slope @xmath31 in the gcs density profile of @xmath32 in a galaxy - scale halo becomes smaller than -5 ( i.e. , much steeper than the outer profile of the dark matter halo ) .",
    ".meaning of acronym [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     thus , the present simulations enable us to investigate physical properties only for old gcs owing to the adopted assumptions of collisionless simulations : physical properties of metal - rich gcs lately formed during secondary dissipative galaxy merger events at lower redshifts ( e.g. , ashman & zepf 1992 ) can not be predicted by this study .",
    "we present the results of the model with @xmath33 , and the dependences of the results on @xmath34 will be given in bekki & yahagi ( 2005 , by ) . if @xmath34 is closely associated with the completion of cosmic reionization , @xmath34 may well range from 6 ( fan et al .",
    "2003 ) to 20 ( kogut et al . 2003 ) .",
    "physical properties of hypothetical gc particles for icgcs in a rich cluster with @xmath35 are described for the model with @xmath36 in which the number ratio of gc particles to all particles is @xmath37 at @xmath2 .",
    "we adopt @xmath36 so that typical subhalos at @xmath38 can contain at least one gc particle .",
    "the present results does not depend on @xmath19 at all as long as @xmath39 .",
    "physical properties of icgcs in groups and clusters with different masses will be given in our forthcoming papers ( by ) .",
    "we assume that the initial radial ( @xmath40 ) profiles of gcss ( @xmath41 ) in subhalos at @xmath38 are the same as those of the simulated dark matter halos that can have the universal `` nfw '' profiles ( navarro , frenk , & white 1996 ) with @xmath42 in their outer parts .",
    "the mean mass of subhalos at z=6 in the present simulations is roughly @xmath43 , which is similar to the total mass of bright dwarf galaxies .",
    "minniti et al . (",
    "1996 ) found that the projected ( @xmath44 ) density profiles of gcss in dwarfs is approximated as @xmath45 , which is translated roughly as @xmath42 by using a canonical conversion formula from @xmath46 into @xmath41 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "therefore , the above assumption on @xmath41 can be regarded as reasonable .",
    "thus we mainly show the fiducial model with @xmath41 similar to the nfw profiles and @xmath47 .",
    "although we base our gc models on _ observational results of gcss at z=0 _ , we can not confirm whether the above @xmath41 and @xmath21 of the fiducial model are really the most probable ( and the best ) for gcss _ for low - mass subhalos at z=6 owing to the lack of observational studies of gcss at high redshifts_. therefore we investigate how the numerical results depend on initial @xmath41 and @xmath21 of subhalos at @xmath38 . since the dependences on @xmath41 and @xmath21 are given in details by by",
    ", we briefly describe the dependence on @xmath21 , which is the most important dependence for physical properties of gcss at @xmath2 ( by ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the large scale ( @xmath48 100 mpc ) structure of ingcs and hgcs and the distributions of gcs in a halo with the total mass ( @xmath25 ) of @xmath49 corresponding to a rich cluster of galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "it is clear from figure 1 that there exists icgcs that are not bounded in any cluster member galaxy - scale halos , though most gcs are within the galaxy - scale halos .",
    "about 29 % of all gcs in this cluster can be classified as icgcs with the number fraction of icgcs ranging from 0.28 at @xmath50 mpc ( where @xmath51 is the distance between a gc and the center of the cluster ) to 0.35 at @xmath52 mpc .",
    "although the number fraction of icgcs in the central 200 kpc of the cluster is only 0.02 , the presence of such central icgcs may well support the scenario by west et al .",
    "( 1995 ) that very high @xmath22 of icgcs in the central giant es in some clusters can be due to icgcs .",
    "figure 2 shows that the projected number density distributions ( @xmath53 ) within the central few hundreds kpc are quite different between icgcs and gcs within any galaxy - scale halos in the cluster ( `` galactic gcs '' referred to as `` ggcs '' ) in the sense that @xmath53 is significantly flatter in icgcs than in ggcs .",
    "this is because most gcs in the central few hundreds kpc of the cluster can be identified as gcs within galaxy - scale halos ( i.e. , smaller number of icgcs ) .",
    "if gcs that are freely drifting under the influence of the cluster potential are located close to the central giant halo(s ) of the cluster ( e.g. , at their pericenter passages of orbital evolution ) , they can be identified as ggcs in the present selection method of icgcs .",
    "therefore we suggest that @xmath53 of icgcs in the central region of the cluster can be somewhat underestimated in figure 2 .",
    "the number fraction of icgcs ranges from @xmath54 to @xmath55 for the simulated clusters with @xmath56 .",
    "the power - law slopes of @xmath53 range from @xmath57 to @xmath58 for the clusters with the above mass range . about @xmath59% of all gcs",
    "are located in the central 50 kpc of the simulated rich clusters , which implies that these inner gcs formed at high redshifts ( @xmath0 ) can be responsible for high @xmath22 of the central cd galaxies .",
    "the more details on the parameter dependences of icgc properties will be discussed in our forthcoming papers ( by ) .",
    "ingcs in the fiducial model comprises about 1% of all gcs formed in subhalos before @xmath38 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "although these ingcs are formed as a result of tidal stripping of gcs from subhalos during hierarchical structure formation through interaction and merging of subhalos between @xmath2 and @xmath38 , there appears to be no remarkable differences in the large scale distributions between ingcs and hgcs at @xmath2 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "figure 3 however indicates clear differences in @xmath27 and @xmath60 distributions between ingcs and hgcs .",
    "for example , the number fraction of ingcs with @xmath61 mpc is 0.46 whereas that of hgcs with @xmath61 mpc is 0.09 .",
    "the derived higher fraction in ingcs strongly suggests that ingcs are truly `` free - floating '' gcs in intergalactic / group / cluster regions .",
    "the @xmath60 distribution of ingcs shows two peaks around @xmath62 and @xmath63 and the number fraction of @xmath64 is 0.27 for ingcs , which is significantly smaller than that ( 0.61 ) for hgcs .",
    "these results imply that the fraction of intercluster gcs among all ingcs can be observed to be small .",
    "figure 4 describes ( 1 ) where progenitor gcs of ingcs were located with respect to the centers of their host subhalos at @xmath38 and ( 2 ) what the mass ranges of their host subhalos were at @xmath38 .",
    "the number fraction of gcs in the outer parts ( @xmath65 ) of their host subhalos at @xmath38 is 0.17 for ingcs and 0.06 for hgcs in figure 4 .",
    "this result suggests that gcs in the outer parts of subhalos , where gcs are more strongly influenced by external tidal force , are more likely to become ingcs and thus confirms that tidal stripping of gcs during interaction and merging of subhalos between @xmath2 and @xmath38 is a major mechanism for ingc formation .",
    "the mean masses of host subhalos of ingcs and hgcs at @xmath38 are @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , in figure 4 .",
    "this is also consistent with the above formation process of ingcs , because less massive subhalos are more strongly influenced by tidal stripping .",
    "if there are negative metallicity gradients of gc systems and positive relations between halo masses and gc mean metallicities in subhalos at @xmath38 , as observed for nearby gc systems ( e.g. , ostrov et al .",
    "1993 ; cte et al .",
    "1998 ) , the results shown in figure 4 imply that ingcs can be significantly more metal - poor than hgcs .",
    "figure 5 describes how the number fraction of ingcs among all gcs ( @xmath68 ) depends on initial density profiles of gcss at @xmath38 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that ( 1 ) @xmath68 is higher for larger @xmath21 and ( 2 ) this @xmath21 dependence can be seen both in the nfw profile and the power - law one with the slope of @xmath69 ( i.e. , the observed profile of the galactic gcs ) .",
    "figure 5 also shows that only @xmath70% of gcs that were initially in the nuclear regions of subhalos at @xmath38 can finally become ingcs .",
    "these results imply that @xmath68 can range from @xmath71 to @xmath72 for a reasonable set of model parameters on initial density profiles of gcss .",
    "@xmath68 also depends on the methods to identify halos and gcs .",
    "@xmath68 is 0.0121 , 0.0075 , 0.0043 , and 0.0024 for @xmath17 = 10 , 20 , 50 , and 100 , respectively .",
    "the number fraction of ingcs that were nuclei at @xmath38 ( @xmath73 ) are 0.0046 , 0.0014 , 0.0003 , and 0.0001 for @xmath17 = 10 , 20 , 50 , and 100 , respectively .",
    "this @xmath73 might well depend on the resolution of simulations .",
    "@xmath68 is 0.0067 in the model with the fof linking length of 0.025 .",
    "about 80 % of gcs that are identified as ingcs are _ not bounded gravitationally _ by any closest halos .",
    "these dependences imply that @xmath68 can range from an order of 0.1% to 1% , given some uncertainties in the best possible parameter values of the methods ( e.g. , fof linking length ) .",
    "although van den bergh ( 1958 ) already suggested the existence of ingcs in the local universe , the present study first showed that ( 1 ) ingcs can be formed during hierarchical formation processes of galaxies and clusters , ( 2 ) these ingcs are about 1 % of all gcs formed before @xmath38 , and ( 3 ) they can be @xmath74 more metal - poor than those within virialized galaxy - scale halos at @xmath2 .",
    "these ingcs are highly unlikely to suffer destruction processes by strong galactic tidal fields that are suggested to be important for understanding the origin of the observed mass function of gcs ( e.g. , fall & zhang 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , we suggest that ( 1 ) the mass function of ingcs can be significantly different from that of gcs in galaxies and ( 2 ) ingcs possibly retain fossil information on gc mass function at the epoch of gc formation .",
    "then how many ingcs are expected to be observed in the intergalactic regions close to the galaxy ?",
    "we can provide an answer for this question by using the present result on the number fraction of ingcs and the initial gc number of the galactic gcs before gc destruction .",
    "mclaughlin ( 1999 ) showed that total number of initial gcs in a galaxy can decrease by a factor of 25 within the hubble time owing to gc destruction by the combination effect of galactic tidal fields and internal gc evolution ( e.g. , mass loss from massive and evolved stars ) .",
    "this means that the initial gc number is about 4000 for the galaxy with the observed gc number of 160 at @xmath2 ( van den bergh 2000 ) . by using the present result that @xmath75% of all gcs can become ingcs ,",
    "the expected number of icgcs in the intergalactic regions close to the galaxy can be @xmath76 .",
    "we thus suggest that some bright objects of these @xmath76 intergalactic gcs can be found in currently ongoing `` all - objects '' spectroscopic surveys for targeted areas ( e.g. , 6df ) .",
    "since white ( 1987 ) pointed out that clusters of galaxies might contain icgcs , several authors have suggested some observational evidences for or against the existence of icgcs ( e.g. , west et al . 1995 ; blakeslee 1997 ; harris et al . 1998 ) .",
    "our future more extensive numerical studies of icgc formation will provide observable predictions on some correlations between number of icgcs and global properties ( e.g. , mass and x - ray temperature of hot gas ) in their host clusters and thus help observers to confirm the existence of icgcs .",
    "furthermore , if physical properties of icgcs strongly depend on @xmath34 after which gc formation was severely suppressed by some physical processes ( e.g. , cosmic reionization ) , they can provide some observational constraints on @xmath34 .",
    "we are grateful to the anonymous referee for valuable comments , which contribute to improve the present paper .",
