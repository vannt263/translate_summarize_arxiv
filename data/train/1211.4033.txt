    "in a subset of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) the broad , optical emission lines ( most notably the balmer lines ) have profiles that can be well described by models that attribute the emission to the surface of a relativistic , keplerian accretion disc .",
    "the most striking of the disc - like profiles are double peaked and are reminiscent of the line profiles observed in cataclysmic variables ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and attributed to their accretion discs .",
    "double - peaked lines in agns have received a great deal of attention since their discovery ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and have motivated the development of disc emission models to describe their profiles ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in these models ,",
    "the emission originates in the photoionized skin of the disc at radii from a few hundred to a few thousand gravitational radii from the centre ( the gravitational radius is defined as @xmath12 ) .",
    "this region of the accretion disc has actually been suggested to be the broad - line region ( blr ) in agns , or at least to be responsible for producing the low - ionization broad lines ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although other mechanisms have been considered for the origin of double - peaked lines , emission from the outer accretion disc is the most plausible one ( e.g. , see arguments in @xcite ) .    with an appropriate choice of model parameters",
    ", axisymmetric disc models can also describe profiles that are not obviously double peaked but instead have double shoulders that are not widely separated or flat tops ( this can be accomplished by choosing a small inclination angle or a very large outer radius , for example ; see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , the initial line - profile models have been extended by introducing non - axisymmetric perturbations to the disc emissivity ( e.g. , an eccentricity or a spiral arm ; see @xcite and references therein ) to describe an even wider variety of profile shapes , such as those that are very asymmetric ( e.g. , with one dominant shoulder ) .",
    "finally , the inclusion in the models of radiative - transfer effects in the disc atmosphere can result in profiles that are flat topped or even single peaked ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) . here",
    "we consider all profiles that have double peaks , shoulders , asymmetries , or other features that resemble those from disc models ( regardless whether the discs in these models are axisymmetric or not ) as disc like .",
    "adopting as our working hypothesis that the outer disc accounts for much of the low - ionization blr emission and that disc - like lines give us a direct view of this blr , we use the lines as tools to gain insights into its structure and physical properties .",
    "disc - like emitters are usually identified via their h@xmath13 or h@xmath0 lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in a few cases , disc - like mg@xmath8ii @xmath9 linesii line is actually a doublet at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and it is treated as a single line throughout this paper . ] have been observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the disc - like lines are among the broadest optical emission lines known in agns , with full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) sometimes exceeding 15000  km  s@xmath16 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the fraction of disc - like emitters among the general population of agns is @xmath17 , determined based on a survey of @xmath18 low - redshift ( @xmath19 ) agns @xcite selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) ; the fraction among radio - loud agns is probably higher by a factor of a few @xcite .",
    "most known disc - like emitters are located at @xmath20 , with the highest - redshift one , j@xmath21 , having been discovered serendipitously in the extended _ chandra _  deep field - south at @xmath22 @xcite .    after almost 30 years since their discovery , there are still two fundamental open questions regarding the nature of disc - like emitters .",
    "the first one is the energy budget problem . in many disc - like emitters ,",
    "the gravitational power available locally in the line - emitting region is insufficient to power the observed lines , and it has been suggested that the outer disc is photoionized by external illumination .",
    "the illumination mechanism , however , is not clear . for the initial sample of disc - like emitters , a central x - ray emitting elevated structure was proposed to illuminate the outer disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , a significant number of high - luminosity disc - like emitters have been discovered recently , which are not expected to possess such an elevated structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". a scattering medium above the disc ( e.g. , an outflowing wind ) can also redirect continuum photons from the centre to the outer disc , as has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite made a somewhat different suggestion that a jet is the scattering medium .",
    "it is thus interesting to test whether there is any excess x - ray emission from high - luminosity disc - like emitters that acts as the power source , or alternatively , whether the radiation from the centre is transported to the outer disc via scattering .",
    "the other open question regards the difference between disc - like emitters and more typical agns .",
    "if the blr is associated with the accretion disc , why do the broad lines appear in only @xmath17 of agns ?",
    "under certain accretion - disc conditions , such as a nearly face - on disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or a disc - emission region with a large ratio of the outer to inner radius ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , the disc emission lines could appear single peaked .",
    "however , these alone are probably not sufficient to solve the problem ( see @xcite for a review )",
    ". one promising model that addresses this problem involves radiative transfer in an accelerating disc wind : a line from the disc that would have a disc - like profile in the absence of a disc wind can appear single peaked because of the non - axisymmetric emissivity pattern produced by the radiative transfer @xcite .",
    "this disc - wind model suggests that disc - like emitters with luminosities close to the eddington limit ( likely high - luminosity agns ) should be rare as the radiatively driven winds are likely denser and would have prevented the formation of disc - like lines .",
    "understanding the nature of disc - like emitters is especially valuable for painting a general picture of the inner structure of agns : the detailed inner components of agns , including the accretion disc , disc wind , blr , and scattering medium , are closely related to the appearance of disc - like emission lines .",
    "high - luminosity disc - like emitters appear to be one key to constrain the possible models that can answer the unresolved questions .",
    "moreover , disc - like emitters have not been studied in detail at higher redshifts ( @xmath23 ) , when the universe was nearly half of its age and possible cosmic evolution over gyrs could have altered their general properties .",
    "we present in this paper x - ray and multiwavelength studies of a sample of eight high - luminosity disc - like emitters that are also at relatively high redshifts ( @xmath1 ) . in section  2",
    "we describe the selection procedure of the sample . in section  3",
    "we present the line - emitting region parameters for these sources derived from line - profile fitting .",
    "we study the x - ray and multiwavelength properties in sections  4 and 5 , respectively . in section  6",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for the energy budget problem , and for the first time , we consider carefully a variety of mechanisms that can balance the energy budget of the line - emitting region in high - luminosity disc - like emitters .",
    "we also discuss the disc - wind model addressing the connection between disc - like emitters and more typical agns .",
    "we summarize in section  7 . throughout this paper , we adopt a cosmology with @xmath24  km  s@xmath16  mpc@xmath16 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we systematically searched for high - luminosity disc - like emitters from the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ; @xcite ) quasar catalog @xcite .",
    "we defined a parent sample of 3132 quasars with @xmath270.8 , @xmath28  erg  s@xmath16  hz@xmath16   ( 2500    monochromatic luminosity ; @xcite ) , and a minimum continuum signal - to - noise ratio ( around h@xmath0 ; unbinned ) @xmath29 . the redshift range was chosen so that we are exploring the relatively high - redshift space ( @xmath30 ) and the h@xmath0 line is well covered by the sdss spectrum ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we fit the sdss spectra using the spectral - fitting routine presented in @xcite , which can perform continuum subtraction and gaussian fitting of emission lines .",
    "the underlying continuum consists of three components : a power - law spectrum , the balmer bump ( between 2000 and 4000   ) , and the iron emission forest ( modeled with templates from @xcite and @xcite ) . after subtracting the continuum",
    ", we used 34 gaussian components to fit the broad h@xmath0 line , along with 23 gaussian components for each of the [ o@xmath8iii ]  @xmath324960 and @xmath325007 narrow lines .",
    "we visually inspected each spectrum that has its h@xmath0 line best fitting by at least one blueshifted and one redshifted gaussian profile , and identified 14 secure disc - like emitters . in this high - luminosity agn sample",
    ", we did not find any source having an h@xmath0 line with two well - defined and well - separated peaks as in those original double - peaked emitters studied in @xcite .",
    "all the h@xmath0 line profiles of these 14 objects have broad blue and red shoulders or flat tops that suggest disc - like emission ( see section 3 below for disc - model fits to the profiles ) . of these 14 sources ,",

    "we selected the six most luminous radio - quiet sources among these 14 disc - like emitters and obtained _ chandra _  snapshot observations of them in cycle 12 ; we chose radio - quiet sources as their x - ray spectra are not dominated by jet - linked emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , our sample consists of eight high - luminosity ( @xmath28 erg  s@xmath16  hz@xmath16 ) and relatively high - redshift ( @xmath1 ) disc - like emitters that have _ chandra _  coverage .",
    "their @xmath37-band absolute ab magnitudes range from @xmath38 to @xmath39 ; these sources are within the top @xmath40 most - luminous quasars in the sdss dr7 quasar catalog in the redshift range of 0.50.8 .",

    "we also discovered broad uv absorption features in j@xmath6 , which are discussed in section 4.2 below ; the other objects do not show apparent uv absorption in their spectra .",

    "* ) , we did not assess it here for the disc - like emitters .",
    "we fit the disc - like h@xmath0 line profiles ( after continuum subtraction ) with the relativistic keplerian disc model of @xcite .",
    "the model assumes that the line originates from the surface of a circular keplerian disc ; the free parameters are the inner and outer radii of the emission regions ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 in units of gravitational radii @xmath46 ) , the disc inclination angle ( @xmath37 ) , the disc emissivity power - law index ( @xmath47 for a simple power - law model or @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 for a broken power - law model ) , ) was assumed first for the emissivity .",
    "if the wings of the line profile could not be well fit , we then adopted the more complex broken power - law model ( @xmath50 when @xmath51 and @xmath52 when @xmath53 ) . ] and the broadening parameter ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the central narrow / broad line was excluded from the fit if present .",
    "the best - fitting parameters for the sample objects are reported in table  [ tbl - fit ] , and the model line profiles are superposed on the spectra in figure  [ fig - opspec ] .",
    "the parameters are within the typical ranges found for other disc - like emitters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these accretion discs generally have small inclination angles ( @xmath55 , relatively face on ) .",
    "the inner radius of the emission region is a crucial parameter for determining the available local viscous energy ( see section  [ sec - power ] ) ; the inner radii for our sample sources range from 100450  @xmath46 , and they are constrained to an accuracy of @xmath56 .",
    "we note that for j@xmath57 , the model fits well the red peak while it shows a slight excess at the blue peak .",
    "in fact , unlike the others , the observed j@xmath57 line profile possesses a slightly weaker blue peak than red peak , which can not be perfectly fit by a circular disc model , and a model with a non - axisymmetric perturbation is probably required ( e.g. , an elliptical disc ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the inner radius of the emission region largely depends on the shape of the wings , and thus this parameter determined from a circular disc model is appropriate for deriving the available local viscous energy .",
    "line profile variability is typical of disc - like emitters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have obtained additional optical spectra for j@xmath36 with the low - resolution spectrograph @xcite on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ; @xcite ) in 2006 jun and 2008 jun , contemporaneous of the _ chandra _  or _ xmm - newton _ observations .",

    "the mg@xmath8ii @xmath9 line profiles in the present sample are not identical to those of the h@xmath0 lines , although a few objects do appear to have shoulders in their mg@xmath8ii profiles reminiscent of the shoulders of the h@xmath0 profiles ( e.g. , j@xmath58 , j@xmath59 , and j@xmath36 ) .",
    "moreover , the widths of the mg@xmath8ii lines are often comparable to those of the h@xmath0 lines . in contrast",

    "moreover , since the wind is radiatively driven , agns radiating at close to the eddington limit ( likely high - luminosity agns ) should generally have stronger winds with larger optical depths than agns with low eddington ratios ( low - luminosity sources ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the fraction of disc - like emitters should decline with agn luminosity .",
    "we found 14 disc - like emitters within the 3132 luminous agns searched ( see section  [ sample ] ) , corresponding to a fraction of 0.4% , although our selection may not be complete owing to the fact that we only searched for secure disc - like emitters and may have missed some possible candidates ( also see footnote 3 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this derived fraction is a factor of @xmath162 smaller than the @xmath17 for the lower - luminosity sample in @xcite , likely consistent with the basic expectation from the disc - wind model .",
    "moreover , we have not found any profiles with widely separated peaks , reminiscent of those of low - luminosity objects such as arp 102b . to compare the fractions of disc - like emitters among agns in different luminosity bins robustly",
    ", they must be identified in a uniform and systematic way for both the high - luminosity and low - luminosity samples , utilizing quantitative selection criteria .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "the discovery of a bal quasar , j@xmath6 , in our disc - like emitter sample is notable , as bal quasars are also a sub - type of agns .",
    "bals have been observed in @xmath11 of optically - selected quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similar to disc - like emitters , bal quasars have indistinguishable ir - to - uv seds from non - bal quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although bal quasars usually show x - ray absorption as mentioned in section  [ sec - xray2 ] .",
    "a popular interpretation is that bal quasars and non - bal quasars are the same type of object but with different viewing angles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or at least that orientation plays an important role in determining the presence of bal features ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is suggested that bals are observed when our line of sight passes through the disc wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "traditionally , such models have required that bal quasars generally be viewed edge - on , with large inclination angles ( @xmath163 ) . however , more recent results ( @xcite and references therein ) suggest that bal quasars can be seen over a wide range of inclination angles , with a tendency to be seen at larger inclination angles than non - bal quasars . in the disc - wind scenario ,",
    "this result constrains disc winds to flow out at different angles above the disc in different objects .",
    "the disc inclination angle of j@xmath6 derived by the disc - model fit in section  [ sec - spec ] is @xmath164 , the largest value of @xmath37 in our sample .",
    "thus , it fits in with the result that bal quasars tend to be seen at larger inclination angles than non - bal quasars .",
    "the main results of this study are the following :    1 .",
    "we measured the x - ray and multiwavelength properties of eight high - luminosity ( @xmath28 erg  s@xmath16  hz@xmath16 ) and relatively high - redshift ( @xmath1 ) disc - like emitters selected from sdss dr7 .",
    "these sources are located in a largely unexplored space of the luminosity - redshift plane .",
    "see section 2 . 2 .",
    "our sample objects show disc - like h@xmath0 line profiles that can be well explained by emission from the outer region ( hundreds to thousands of @xmath46 ) of a keplerian accretion disc .",
    "the emission - region parameters are within the typical ranges found for other disc - like emitters .",
    "see section  3 .",
    "3 .   seven sources have typical x - ray spectra with photon indices @xmath22.0 ; two of them show some amount of x - ray absorption ( @xmath3@xmath4  @xmath5 when modeled using neutral gas ) .",
    "the other source , j@xmath6 , has only three @xmath165  kev photons observed and is probably heavily obscured ( @xmath7  @xmath5 ) .",
    "based on the longer observations of j@xmath36 by _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _ , we did not detect the tentative fe@xmath8xxv k@xmath13 line emission reported by @xcite .",
    "see section  4 .",
    "we constructed ir - to - uv seds of the sample objects .",
    "all have typical quasar seds with a bbb in the uv , different from low - luminosity disc - like emitters .",
    "the emission mechanisms are probably different : low - luminosity sources are powered by riafs , while high - luminosity sources have standard accretion discs radiating with high efficiency .",
    "see section  5.1 .",
    "the x - ray - to - optical power - law slope parameters ( @xmath10 ) for our sources follow the established relation except for the two sources with significant x - ray absorption",
    ". there does not appear to be any significant excess x - ray emission for the radio - quiet disc - like emitter population overall .",
    "this high - luminosity and relatively high - redshift sample does not show any distinct features in terms of x - ray emission or multiwavelength properties .",
    "see section 5.2 .",
    "we analyzed the energy budget requirements for powering the emission lines . for disc - like emitters in general ,",
    "external illumination is required .",
    "the inner disc should illuminate and ionize the outer disc efficiently via direct illumination and/or scattering ; the median required @xmath144 value is @xmath11 , and it is @xmath149 for our high - luminosity objects . scattering alone can provide an @xmath144 value of @xmath166 , insufficient to power the lines .",
    "warped accretion discs are probably needed for direct illumination to work efficiently , especially in high - luminosity objects with geometrically thin discs .",
    "see section 6.1 .",
    "we discussed the disc - wind model that was proposed to explain the small fraction of disc - like emitters among the general agn population , and we showed how our current results fit into the context of this model . see section 6.2 .",
    "we discovered a lobal quasar , j@xmath6 , among our disc - like emitters .",
    "this object demonstrates that disc - like emission lines and bals are not exclusive phenomena .",
    "j@xmath6 has a relatively small disc inclination angle compared to traditional bal quasars .",
    "see sections 4.2 and 6.2 .",
    "studies of disc - like emitters open a window to probing the inner structure of agns , such as the accretion disc , disc wind , and blr .",
    "the high - luminosity and relatively high - redshift sample presented here places further constraints on the disc illumination - mechanism and the corresponding agn components ( accretion disc and scattering medium ) .",
    "further spectral surveys of x - ray absorption in disc - like emitters will help to clarify the covering factor and optical depth of the scattering medium . a large and complete optical survey of disc - like emitters in different luminosity ranges",
    ", utilizing quantitative selection criteria , will determine whether the fraction of disc - like emitters decreases as luminosity increases , and thus assess the applicability of the disc - wind model .",
    "it will also be of interest to compare the detailed properties ( e.g. , seds and x - ray spectra ) of agns with the same luminosity , similar line widths , but different broad emission - line profiles ( e.g. , single peaked vs. broad shoulders or flat tops ) , to try to find the underlying physics that determines the shape of the line profile .     + we acknowledge financial support from nasa adp grant nnx10ac99 g",
