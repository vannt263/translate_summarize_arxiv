    "the first extra solar planet was discovered in the early 1990s by @xcite .",
    "today the statistics of the observations showed that the architecture of our solar system seems to be unique compared with exoplanetary systems . at the moment we know about 1900 exoplanets in more than 1200 planetary systems , among them more than 100 exoplanets are in binary - star systems and 20 are in multiple - star systems .",
    "the data of all planets are collected in the exoplanet - catalogue maintained by j. schneider ; whereas the binary and multiple - star systems can be found separately in the binary catalogue of exoplanets maintained by r. schwarz . for nearby sun - like stars ,",
    "approximately 70 percent are confirmed to be double or multiple systems ( @xmath1% for o - b stars , @xcite , @xcite ; @xmath2% for g - m stars , @xcite ) .",
    "statistics of solar - type dwarfs were studied by @xcite with a distance - limited sample of 4847 targets .",
    "a field population was found of about 54% for single stars , 33% binary stars , 8% triple systems , 4% for quadrupole systems , 1% for systems",
    "@xmath3 .    according to the work of @xcite",
    "one can distinguish three types of planetary orbits in a binary star system :    1 .",
    "s - type , where the planet orbits one of the two stars ; 2 .",
    "p - type , where the planet orbits the entire binary ; 3 .",
    "t - type : a planet may orbit close to one of the two equilibrium points @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( trojan planets ) .    from the dynamical point of view",
    "the binary star systems are particularly interesting . for the circular restricted three - body problem ( cr3bp )",
    "it has been shown by @xcite and @xcite that only for mass ratios in the interval @xmath6 the librational motion is linearly stable ( here @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "however , former studies of @xcite and @xcite could show that there exist stable orbits beyond gascheau s value ( @xmath9 ) , in the planar case .",
    "whereas , @xcite could also show that in the spatial restricted three - body problem",
    ". however , even the extended stability region limits the possibility to find trojans in double stars , because the necessary mass ratios are relatively rare .",
    "most observations of planets in binaries are focused on @xmath10 ( stars have similar masses ) and are restricted sun like stars .",
    "nevertheless the dynamical study of @xcite could show with a few real binary systems that the t - type configuration may be not only of theoretical interest .",
    "therefore we show a distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) of the mass ratio of all detected exoplanets in binaries .",
    "the most common mass ratios are 0.25 and 0.5 .",
    "the frequency of the interesting mass ratios ( @xmath9 ) for the trojan configuration is around 3 percent .",
    "when we compare fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with the statistics of the nearby sun - like stars the value is larger , it is around 10 percent  @xcite .",
    "however , if one considers also systems with a brown dwarf as companion the number of possible candidates would be larger ( as shown in our candidate list tab .",
    "[ tab3 ] ) , due to their substellar masses .     of all binary star systems with exoplanets , taken from binary catalogue of exoplanets ( http://www.univie.ac.at/adg/schwarz/multiple.html).,width=268 ]    our work was motivated by the huge number of trojans which were found in the solar system around different planets ( earth , mars , jupiter , uranus and neptune ) .",
    "the possibility of trojan planets in exoplanetary systems was discussed in several dynamical investigations like e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies predict that trojans are a by - product of planet formation and evolution , see the hydrodynamic simulations of a protoplanetary disk , like in the work of @xcite and @xcite . whereas @xcite studied the orbital evolution of co - orbital planets embedded in a protoplanetary disc .",
    "the investigation on the possibility of a migration - induced resonance locking in systems containing three planets , namely an earth - like planet , a super - earth and a gas giant with one jupiter mass by @xcite found that the super - earth planet captures the earth - like planet into co - orbital motion temporarily . in case of binary systems",
    "the formation or capture scenario for possible trojan planets are not yet investigated .",
    "@xcite and @xcite examined the sensitivity of transit timing variations ( ttvs ) for a possible detection of trojan companions .",
    "they demonstrated that this method offers the potential to detect terrestrial - mass trojans using existing ground - based observatories .",
    "@xcite reported a systematic search for extrasolar trojan companions to 2244 known kepler objects , but no trojan candidates were found . in a theoretical work of  @xcite , they studied the ttvs for planets in the horseshoe regime by using semi - analytical models .",
    "this paper is divided into two parts : the first part investigates the stability of trojan planets in binary systems , whereas the second part is devoted to the possible detection of trojan planets by the help of eclipse timing variations ( etv ) .",
    "we studied the planar full three - body problem ( 3bp ) with numerical integrators . in this problem three finite bodies , the primaries ( @xmath11 @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xmath12 ) revolve about their common center of mass , starting on circular orbits ( @xmath14 ) , and a third body @xmath15 moves under their gravitational influence in the same orbit as @xmath16 close to the equilibrium point @xmath4 60 degree ahead of the secondary star .",
    "we have regarded all the celestial bodies involved as point masses and integrated the dimensionless ( the semi - major axis set to one ) equations of motion for an integration time up to @xmath17 and @xmath18 periods of the secondary star for the stability maps and @xmath19 periods for special cases shown in chapter [ stab ] . for our simulations we used the lie - method with an automatic step - size control to solve the equations of motion @xcite .",
    "the computations were accomplished only in the vicinity of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is symmetric in the 3bp ) . for the calculations of the stability maps we varied the eccentricities of the trojans ( @xmath20=trojan planet ) from @xmath21 up to @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , we varied the mass of the secondary object from @xmath23 ( @xmath24 corresponds to 1 solar mass ) until the end of the stability border with a map size of 235  x  40 values ( @xmath16 x @xmath20 ) . the lower limit of @xmath16 presents planets of about 2 jupiter masses as shown in our stability investigations . in case of the etv s we started our investigations at masses equal to substellar objects ( approximately 13 jupiter masses ) .",
    "the stability border changes because we also calculated the stability maps for different masses of the host star @xmath25=1 , 2 and 3  @xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath27 the stability border lies at @xmath28 @xmath26 , for @xmath29 at @xmath30 @xmath26 and for @xmath31 at @xmath32 @xmath26 .    to get a good estimation about occurring perturbations on the secondary star ( to measure etvs ) we used trojan planets with different sizes : mars , earth , neptune and jupiter , which corresponds to @xmath33 @xmath26 .      for the analysis of the orbit we used the method of the maximum eccentricity @xmath34 .",
    "in former studies we found a good agreement with chaos indicators ( as shown in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) like the lyapunov characteristic indicator ( lci ) , like in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34 method uses as an indication of stability a straightforward check based on the maximum value of the trojans eccentricity reached during the total integration time .",
    "if the trojan s orbit becomes parabolic ( @xmath35 ) the system is considered to be unstable .",
    "the @xmath34 is defined as follows :    @xmath36    to analyse the orbital behaviour of the third body @xmath37 ( e.g. tadpole , horseshoe , or satellite ) , we used the amplitude of libration , as done in the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the classification of the orbit was done by checking the libration amplitude @xmath0 which is defined as the difference between the mean longitude of the trojan and the secondary star ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 are given by @xmath41 , @xmath42 were @xmath43 , @xmath44 are the longitudes of ascending node of the trojan body and of the @xmath16 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the mean anomaly of the third body respectively of the secondary star .",
    "as for the @xmath34 we determined the maximum libration amplitude @xmath47 for the total integration time :    @xmath48    in the case of a large libration amplitude the trojan may become a horseshoe orbit or may be ejected out of the trojan region after a close approach with the secondary body .",
    "the value of @xmath47 should be smaller than @xmath49 for tadpole orbits .",
    "as indicated by the results of the stability analysis , an exoplanet in a t - type orbit may be stable in the vicinity of a binary star system .",
    "the gravitational perturbation of this planet may affect the motions of the two stars and cause their orbits to deviate from keplerian . in an eclipsing binary",
    ", these deviations result in variations in the time and duration of the eclipse .",
    "we determined the etvs by calculating the perturbed case , where the planet induced constant rate of apsidal precession is removed by a linear fit .",
    "we also took into account the long - term effects caused by the binaries motion around the system center of mass .",
    "first of all we investigated the stability of the lagrangian point @xmath4 in the planar three - body problem to determine the stability limits and to investigate whether the orbits are still in trojan motion or not , by the help of @xmath47 .",
    "our studies showed that all stable orbits stay in tadpole motion .",
    "in addition we used different masses of the primary and secondary star , which might be useful for future observations of different stars .",
    "we computed the stability maps by changing the mass of the secondary and the eccentricity of the trojan .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , for the 3 different masses of the primary star ( 1 , 2 and 3  @xmath26 ) .",
    "as one can see the stability maps do not start at zero ( x and y axes in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "that means the initial mass of the secondary body is 0.001  @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "however , we focus on the stability region from @xmath52 , because lower masses ( planet - like masses ) of the secondary are not interesting for binary ( like ) star - systems and initially circular orbits ( @xmath53 ) do not produce detectable etv signals .",
    "an example of the stability maps is given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which is divided into 3 different graphs , showing different masses of the primary star ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "whereas , the upper graph depicts the stability map for @xmath54 , the middle one depicts @xmath55 and the lower one @xmath56 . we can conclude that the number of stable orbits do not differ much , as summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] , where we also show the studies for different masses of the trojan planet ( from earth mass up to jupiter mass ) . in principle",
    "the number of stable orbits do not change very much for the different masses of the trojan .",
    "nevertheless , the shape of the stable region ( gaps ) are changing when we change the mass of the secondary star .",
    "the gaps are mainly caused by secondary resonances which were investigated in the work of @xcite for large mass ratios and in @xcite for low mass ratios .",
    "in addition , one can see that the trojan body can have larger initial eccentricity for larger mass of the primary star @xmath25 , this is especially well visible for small masses of @xmath16 . the maximum stable eccentricity @xmath57 is valid for @xmath58 ( which corresponds to a binary - like star system with a brown dwarf ) and for different masses of central star ( @xmath25 ) @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 for @xmath61 , @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "also the limit of the stable region increases with a more massive central star : for @xmath54 the limit amounts @xmath66 , for @xmath55 the limit amounts @xmath67 and for @xmath68 we have the largest value @xmath69 .",
    "the stability limit changes because of the different mass ratio @xmath7 as we know from the circular restricted three - body problem .",
    "in addition , we made long term integrations , represented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] by the help of cuts of the stability maps shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( cuts for @xmath70 ) .",
    "the cuts were made for the different masses of the planets , as shown in the chapter of the initial conditions .",
    "we presented only the case of @xmath71 , because the other cases are similar .",
    "the goal of these cuts was to see whether the stability - island for high mass ratios is still stable for a long time , which is the case .     in the planar ( @xmath72 ) three - body problem for a trojan planet with 1  @xmath73 , for 1  @xmath26 ( upper graph ) 2  @xmath26 ( middle graph ) and 3  @xmath26 ( lower graph ) .",
