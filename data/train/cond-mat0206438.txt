    "one of the outstanding problems in the theory of finite - dimensional spin glasses is the structure of the phase diagram .",
    "numerical investigations have revealed the precise locations of critical points and phase boundaries @xcite .",
    "however we still have only limited knowledge from analytical treatments of the problem .",
    "an interesting exception is the gauge theory which makes use of gauge symmetry of the system to derive a variety of exact / rigorous results on physical quantities including the energy , specific heat and correlation functions @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we derive a class of relations for the order parameters and correlation functions using the gauge theory to clarify the behaviour of the system within the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "properties of the ferromagnetic phase in models of spin glasses have not been studied very extensively compared to the spin glass phase . nevertheless , as shown in references @xcite and @xcite , a very interesting non - trivial change of the system behaviour is observed on a line , the nishimori line , in the phase diagram : the spins become more ferromagnetically ordered ( _ i.e. _ parallel to each other ) as the temperature is lowered above this line whereas the same spins turn to become misaligned below the same line with further decrease of the temperature .",
    "although this line is not a phase boundary in the thermodynamic sense , it marks in the above sense a clear crossover between the two regions within the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the argument in the present paper using the gauge theory reinforces this picture through relations between the order parameters and their derivatives .",
    "an important consequence of the gauge theory is an identity between the distribution function of the ferromagnetic order parameter @xmath0 and that of the spin glass order parameter @xmath1 : these two functions are equal to each other @xmath2 on the nishimori line @xcite . this functional identity implies the absence of replica symmetry breaking because @xmath0 is trivial , composed of at most two simple delta functions , and , therefore , so is @xmath1 .",
    "the relation @xmath2 also leads to the equality @xmath3 , an identity between the ferromagnetic and spin glass order parameters @xcite , implying an _ exact _ balance between the two types of ordering . from @xmath3",
    "we may expect that the ferromagnetic order parameter exceeds the spin glass order parameter @xmath4 above the nishimori line because , in the limit of non - random system ( which is above the line ) , we have @xmath5 .",
    "another reason to expect @xmath4 is that , as mentioned above , ferromagnetic ordering dominates above the line .",
    "the opposite inequality @xmath6 is likely to hold below the same line since the spin glass phase ( lying below the line ) has @xmath7 , and , in addition , the effects of quenched randomness is more dominant ( apparent misalignment of spins ) below the line as explained above .",
    "these two inequalities for the order parameters can be verified in the mean - field sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite within the replica - symmetric solution ( which is valid near the nishimori line as mentioned above ) but have been considered difficult to check analytically for general finite - dimensional systems .",
    "we show in the present paper that these inequalities are closely related with temperature derivatives and some inequalities of the order parameters , thus coming closer to a proof .",
    "we present our results and their proofs in the next section .",

    "an immediate consequence of ( [ 1st - deriv ] ) is that the derivatives of @xmath15 and @xmath22 have the same sign when @xmath10 .",

    "@xmath15 have different signs at @xmath10 as shown in this figure . ]    in the plausible case that @xmath56 , it follows from ( [ 1st - deriv ] ) that @xmath15 increases twice as rapidly as @xmath22 does as the temperature is lowered ( see figure [ fig : case1 ] ( left ) ) .     if these quantities are increasing functions of @xmath36 ( left ) .",
    "the opposite possibility is shown on the right . ]    it naturally follows that @xmath15 is larger than @xmath22 at least slightly below the nishimori line @xmath57 and the opposite inequality @xmath4 holds when @xmath58 .",
    "this is the most natural case as discussed in the introduction : the ferromagnetic ordering is dominant @xmath59 above the nishimori line ( @xmath58 ) and quenched - disorder - driven random ordering proliferates in the sense @xmath6 below the same line ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the point is that we have reduced the inequality @xmath6 for @xmath60 to an intuitively natural relation @xmath61 at @xmath10 ( although we still do not have a rigorous proof of the latter . )",
    "if the opposite inequality @xmath62 holds at @xmath10 , the order parameters behave as depicted in figure [ fig : case1 ] ( right ) .",
    "we can not exclude this possibility from the present argument , but it seems quite unlikely that both order parameters @xmath15 and @xmath22 decrease with temperature decrease on and around the line @xmath10 which runs through the central part of the ferromagnetic phase as seen in figure [ fig : phase - diagram ] . if there exists a reentrant transition ( below which @xmath22 vanishes but @xmath15 can stay finite ) , only @xmath22 may decrease toward such a transition temperature from above unlike figure [ fig : case1 ] ( right ) .",
    "although we believe that such a situation is not plausible to exist @xcite , it would happen at very low temperatures if it does at all , not around the line @xmath10 which runs through relatively high temperature parts of the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the final possibility is that the derivatives in ( [ 1st - deriv ] ) vanish .",
    "again , both derivatives should vanish , not just one of them .",
    "the inequality for the second derivative ( [ 2nd - deriv ] ) does not tell much about the behaviour of @xmath22 and @xmath15 around @xmath10 .",
    "it is instructive to remember in this connection that the average _ sign _ of local magnetization reaches its maximum at @xmath10 as a function of @xmath36 ( or the temperature ) @xcite @xmath63 \\le m(k_p , k_p ) .",
    "\\label{align}\\ ] ] this means that the number of up spins under up - spin boundaries becomes maximum at @xmath10 as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "although this relation ( [ align ] ) can be proved for an arbitrary @xmath36 by the gauge theory @xcite , it is useful to check it by taking the derivative of ( [ align ] ) ( as we did for @xmath22 and @xmath15 ) : @xmath64   = 2 \\left [ \\delta ( \\langle s_i \\rangle_k )      \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}\\langle s_i \\rangle_k\\right ]      = 2 \\left[\\langle \\sigma_i \\rangle_{k_p }    \\delta ( \\langle s_i \\rangle_k )      \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}\\langle s_i \\rangle_k\\right ]   = 0 ,     \\label{m - deriv}\\ ] ] the last equality being valid for @xmath10 .",
    "equation ( [ m - deriv ] ) implies that the effects of spins with positive temperature derivative ( @xmath65 ) just match those of negative temperature derivative ( @xmath66 ) at @xmath10 if we concentrate ourselves on the spins with vanishing local magnetization @xmath67 .",
    "thus , at @xmath10 , some spins change its local magnetization from positive value to negative value whereas essentially the same number of spins change the sign of local magnetization in the opposite way .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this observation does not necessarily mean vanishing derivatives of the ferromagnetic and spin glass order parameters at @xmath10 , that is , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are in general not vanishing at @xmath10 : the absolute value of local magnetization @xmath70 , which is ignored in @xmath71 , at sites with @xmath72 may grow more rapidly than at sites with @xmath73 as @xmath36 decreases , compensating for the decrease in the number of up spins below @xmath10 , leading to a positive derivative @xmath74 .",
    "the present argument does not apply in the paramagnetic phase where the order parameters @xmath22 and @xmath15 vanish .",
    "however , the relation ( [ cc_relation ] ) for correlation functions , the two - point functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 in particular , suggests that @xmath77 if @xmath58 and @xmath78 if @xmath60 .",
    "this means that the ferromagnetic correlation length @xmath79 ( defined by @xmath80 ) is larger than the spin glass correlation length @xmath81 ( defined by @xmath82 ) for @xmath58 ( above the nishimori line ) whereas the opposite inequality holds below the line .",
    "very similar conclusions follow from the result ( [ mq_ineq2 ] ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath15 shown in figure [ fig : excluded ] violates these inequalities because , in the temperature range where @xmath33 exceeds @xmath34 , @xmath33 is seen to be larger than its value at @xmath10 .",
    "the cases given in figure [ fig : case1 ] are compatible with the present inequalities : if @xmath83 , then @xmath33 is smaller than @xmath84 .",
    "an advantage of the present inequalities ( [ mq_ineq2 ] ) over the relation ( [ 1st - deriv ] ) is that we can analyze the behaviour of order parameters well away from the nishimori line , that is , @xmath36 can be much larger or smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "a weak point is that quantitative relations for the increase / decrease rates are not given unlike ( [ 1st - deriv ] ) .",
    "another problem to remember concerning ( [ mq_ineq2 ] ) is that we may not be able to describe the system only in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath15 at very low temperatures if replica symmetry breaking exists as it is the case in the sherrington - kirkpartrick model @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented above strongly indicates that the nishimori line @xmath10 marks a crossover between the purely ferromagnetically - ordered region and disorder - dominated region within the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "this observation is consistent also with renormalization group analyses : the low - temperature region is controlled by a fixed point at @xmath85 with finite disorder ( @xmath86 ) whereas the high - temperature region is described by a different fixed point representative of the critical curve above the multicritical point @xcite .",
    "an important future direction of investigation is a rigorous proof of the relation @xmath87 at @xmath10 , which needs additional ideas .",
    "in this appendix we drive equations ( [ magnetization ] ) and ( [ c - identity ] ) following references @xcite and @xcite . the ferromagnetic order parameter is defined by @xmath88      = \\frac{1}{(2\\cosh k_p)^{n_b } }    \\sum_{\\{\\tau_{ij}=\\pm 1\\ } } \\exp ( k_p \\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle } \\tau_{ij } )     \\frac{\\sum_{\\{s\\ } } s_i \\exp ( k\\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle } \\tau_{ij}s_i s_j ) }    { \\sum_{\\{s\\ } } \\exp ( k\\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle } \\tau_{ij}s_i s_j)}.        \\label{m - def - detail}\\ ] ] here @xmath89 is the sign of @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) , the sums in the exponents run over all pairs of sites on the lattice under consideration , and @xmath92 is the total number of bonds .",
    "the factor @xmath93 gives the probability weight of configurational average of the @xmath8 model since this quantity equals @xmath9 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath96 as can be verified from the definition @xmath97 .",
    "spins on the boundary are all up .",
    "let us apply a gauge transformation @xmath98 to all sites , where @xmath20 is a gauge variable fixed either to @xmath99 or @xmath100 arbitrarily at each site ( @xmath101 on the boundary ) .",
    "the hamiltonian in the exponents of ( [ m - def - detail ] ) is invariant under this gauge transformation .",
    "since the gauge transformation is just a re - definition of running variables in ( [ m - def - detail ] ) , it does not affect the value of the right hand side , and we have @xmath102 as both sides of this equation are independent of the choice of the values of @xmath103 , we may sum the right hand side over all possible values of @xmath103 and divide the result by @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the total number of sites , to find @xmath106 by inserting the identity @xmath107 just in front of the sum over @xmath103 in the summand , we obtain @xmath108 the last line ( [ last ] ) can be confirmed by applying the gauge transformation to ( [ last ] ) and using the same argument as above with gauge invariance of the product @xmath109 in mind to derive ( [ 2ndlast ] ) . equation ( [ last ] )",
    "is exactly the definition of the right hand side of ( [ magnetization ] ) , which completes the proof . a similar argument leads to ( [ c - identity ] ) .",
