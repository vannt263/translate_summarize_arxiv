    "the perhaps simplest combination is @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "if the object hit us at time @xmath11 , then @xmath12 will give us a running estimation of the time that is left until contact , but turns out to work well until short before ttc .",
    "moreover , we do not need to know anything about the approaching object : the ttc estimation computed by @xmath6 is independent of object size and velocity .",
    "neurons with @xmath6-like responses were indeed identified in the nucleus retundus of the pigeon brain @xcite . in humans ,",
    "only fast interceptive actions seem to rely exclusively on @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "accurate ttc estimation , however , seems to involve further mechanisms ( rate of disparity change @xcite ) . +",
    "another function of ovs with biological relevance is @xmath13 , with @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "while @xmath0-type neurons were found again in pigeons @xcite and bullfrogs @xcite , most data were gathered from the lgmd in locusts ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0-function is a phenomenological model for the lgmd , and implies three principal hypothesis : _ (",

    "( ii ) _ the lgmd carries out biophysical computations for implementing the multiplicative operation . it has been suggested that multiplication is done within the lgmd itself , by subtracting the logarithmically encoded variables @xmath15 @xcite . _ ( iii ) _ the peak of the @xmath0-function occurs before ttc , at visual angle @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "it follows ttc for certain stimulus configurations ( e.g. @xmath17 ) . in principle",
    ", @xmath18 can be accounted for by @xmath19 with a fixed delay @xmath20 ( e.g. @xmath21 ) .",
    "but other researchers observed that lgmd activity continuous to rise after ttc even for @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies remain unexplained so far @xcite , but stimulation dynamics perhaps plays a role .",

    "the @xmath96-function makes life easier when it comes to fitting experimental data .",

    "computational models predict that lgmd response features originate from excitatory and inhibitory interactions in  and between  presynaptic neuronal layers .",
