    "a majority of cosmologists consider dark energy to be the cause of this observed accelerated cosmological expansion .",
    "this dark energy , most simply thought of as a negative pressure substance , dominates the current cosmological energy budget . for reviews of dark energy",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein .",

    "it has been known for a while that the @xmath1cdm model is reasonably consistent with most observations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "although most predictions of the @xmath1cdm model are reasonably consistent with the measurements , the @xmath1cdm model has some curious features .",
    "for instance , the measured cosmological constant energy density is 120 orders of magnitude smaller than the energy density naively expected from quantum field theory ( this is known as the fine - tuning puzzle ) .",
    "a second curiosity is what is known as the coincidence puzzle : the energy density of a cosmological constant , @xmath5 , is independent of time , but that of matter , @xmath6 , decreases with time during the cosmological expansion , so it is curious why we ( observers ) happen to live at this ( apparently ) special time , when the dark energy and the non - relativistic matter energy densities are of comparable magnitude .    these puzzles could be partially resolved if the dark energy density is a slowly decreasing function of time . in this case",
    "the dark energy density will remain comparable to the non - relativistic matter density for a longer time . for recent discussions of time - varying dark energy models ,",

    "we will consider two dark energy models ( with dark energy being either a cosmological constant or a slowly - evolving scalar field @xmath7 ) as well as a dark energy parameterization .    in the @xmath1cdm model , time - independent dark energy density ( the cosmological constant @xmath1 )",

    "cmb anisotropy , snia , and bao measurements provide the strongest support for this conclusion .",
    "however , the error bars associated with these three types of data are still too large to allow for a significant observational discrimination between the @xmath1cdm model and the two simple time - varying dark energy models discussed above .",
    "this is one motivation for considering additional kinds of data .",
    "if the constraints from the new data differ considerably from the old ones , this could mean that at least one of the data sets had an undetected systematic error , or it could mean that the model being tested is observationally inconsistent .",
    "either of these is an important result .",
    "on the other hand , if the constraints from the new and the old data are consistent , then a joint analysis of all the data could result in tighter constraints , and so might result in significantly discriminating between constant and time - varying dark energy models .",
