    "<S> we introduce a simple theoretical model that describes the interaction of light with optical metamaterials in terms of interfering optical plane waves . in this model , a metamaterial </S>",
    "<S> is considered to consist of planar arrays of densely packed nanoparticles . in the analysis </S>",
    "<S> , each such array reduces to an infinitely thin homogeneous sheet . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission and reflection coefficients of this sheet are found to be equal to those of an isolated nanoparticle array and , therefore , they are easy to evaluate numerically for arbitrary shapes and arrangements of the particles . </S>",
    "<S> the presented theory enables fast calculation of electromagnetic fields interacting with a metamaterial slab of an arbitrary size , which , for example , can be used to retrieve the effective refractive index and wave impedance in the material . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown to accurately describe optically anisotropic metamaterials that in addition exhibit strong spatial dispersion , such as bifacial metamaterials .    </S>",
    "<S> optical metamaterials are man - made materials composed of densely packed subwavelength - size nanoparticles appearing like artificial atoms to light . </S>",
    "<S> while the optical response of each individual nanoparticle can be revealed using , e.g. , the electromagnetic multipole expansion @xcite , the description of the macroscopic optical response of a real three - dimensional metamaterial still remains a challenge . </S>",
    "<S> this description is complicated by non - trivial interactions between the nanoparticles , including evanescent - wave coupling between them . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we however propose a way to calculate the transmission and reflection characteristics of metamaterial slabs , including anisotropic and spatially dispersive ones , without resorting to evanescent waves .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , both numerical @xcite and experimental @xcite techniques have been used to obtain the transmission and reflection coefficients for metamaterial slabs with a rather limited number of nanostructured layers . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients obtained for such slabs do not necessarily describe the properties of a bulk metamaterial . </S>",
    "<S> one approach to characterize the material would be to successively increase the number of layers and see if the optical characteristics converge @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the understanding of the real physics that determines the final transmission properties is lost when using this procedure . </S>",
    "<S> the important question is then whether a certain metamaterial slab can be treated as a slab of homogeneous material . to answer this question </S>",
    "<S> , one can for example calculate the bloch eigenmodes in an infinitely extended metamaterial and then , in an additional calculation , check which modes are involved when light is reflected by a semi - infinite metamaterial @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the calculations show that all but the fundamental bloch mode are negligible , one can introduce wave parameters , such as the refractive index and wave impedance , for this mode and treat the material as homogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> here , we propose a more straightforward approach , where the properties of a homogenizable metamaterial slab of any thickness are directly linked to the properties of a single layer of the material .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , several retrieval procedures have been introduced to obtain effective wave parameters , such as refractive index and wave impedance , from the reflection and transmission coefficients of a metamaterial slab @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these retrieval procedures rely upon the fresnel coefficients which are derived for dipolar media </S>",
    "<S> . however , for the class of bifacial metamaterials in which the electric quadrupole excitations are present @xcite , the classical electromagnetic boundary conditions do not hold @xcite . consequently </S>",
    "<S> , neither the standard fresnel coefficients nor the retrieval procedures based on these coefficients can be applied to these metamaterials . </S>",
    "<S> the development of an adequate theory for the description of highly spatially dispersive metamaterials , such as bifacial metamaterials , would be of great practical importance , e.g. , for solar cell applications .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we re - examine the propagation of light through a slab of spatially dispersive optical metamaterial . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both the transmission and reflection by the slab can be surprisingly accurately described in terms of propagating optical plane waves only , which dramatically simplifies the description . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce simple analytical expressions that enable one to evaluate the optical characteristics of a thick metamaterial slab by using only the transmission and reflection coefficients of a single layer of the nanoparticles . </S>",
    "<S> the single - layer coefficients are evaluated numerically . </S>",
    "<S> these coefficients enable one to calculate the electromagnetic fields inside the material and thereby evaluate the wave parameters , such as the refractive index and wave impedance . </S>",
    "<S> compared to previously reported theoretical approaches to the problem , our approach is easy to use in practice independently of the shapes and material compositions of the nanoparticles and of the propagation direction and polarization of the optical waves as long as the material is homogenizable .    , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) for each of these sheets </S>",
    "<S> are taken to be equal to those of a single isolated layer of the metamaterial.[fig1 ] ]    consider a metamaterial slab that is created by stacking two - dimensional arrays of nanoscatterers in a transparent dielectric medium ( see figure  [ fig1]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> when illuminated by an optical plane wave , the first layer of nanoscatterers transmits a certain portion of the incident field . a part of this transmitted field is then reflected back by the second layer and the rest is partially absorbed and partially transmitted further to the third layer . provided that the periodicity within each layer is sufficiently smaller than the illumination wavelength , the diffracted waves will be evanescent and the propagating field between the neighboring layers will consist of two optical plane waves . furthermore , since the particles in each layer are packed very densely , their _ collective _ evanescent field can have a very short decay length in the direction perpendicular to the layer ; note that the _ individual _ evanescent fields of the particles are still of a long range compared to the particle separation . </S>",
    "<S> this effect makes it possible to neglect the near - fields of the layers and describe each layer simply as an infinitesimally thin sheet surrounded by the host dielectric ( see figure  [ fig1]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total transmission and reflection of the slab is then described in terms of the transmission and reflection coefficients of the individual sheets in a way resembling the description of fabry - perot interferometers . </S>",
    "<S> similar division of metamaterial slabs into homogenized layers has been applied in the context of effective electromagnetic parameter retrieval @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach is as follows . for a single isolated layer of a metamaterial , </S>",
    "<S> we first numerically calculate the transmission and reflection coefficients and assign them to an equivalent infinitesimally thin sheet in the middle of the unit cells . </S>",
    "<S> these coefficients depend on both the angle of incidence @xmath3 and the polarization of the incident field . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for bifacial nanoscatterer arrays , the reflection coefficient changes if the illumination direction is reversed @xcite . therefore , for the wave propagating to the right ( left ) within the metamaterial , we use the reflection coefficient @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) to describe the reflection from the left ( right ) side of each layer . likewise , the transmission coefficient @xmath4 ( @xmath0 ) describes the transmission of a wave incident from the left ( right ) side of each layer . </S>",
    "<S> optical reciprocity ensures that the transmission coefficients must be the same if normal incidence illumination is considered . when calculated in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath0 automatically include the near- and far - field coupling between the scatterers within the layer in question . </S>",
    "<S> as has been already mentioned , this coupling makes the extent of the evanescent wave along the layer s normal shorter for denser packing of the scatterers .     and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the unit cells of the metamaterial are shown with dashed lines.[fig2 ] ]    let a plane wave with a transverse field amplitude @xmath6 and a wave vector @xmath7 be incident on a metamaterial slab that consists of @xmath8 layers of thickness @xmath9 and has its surface normal along the @xmath10 axis ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the wave is assumed to be either te- or tm - polarized . </S>",
    "<S> treating each nanoscatterer layer as an infinitesimally thin sheet , we consider the counter - propagating waves between the sheets to have wave vectors @xmath11 , because the material between the sheets is considered to be the same as outside the slab . assuming that the polarization state is conserved , the transverse fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 after each sheet @xmath14 in figure  [ fig2 ] must satisfy the following equations @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . for chiral metamaterials , both polarization states must be considered simultaneously . in this case , </S>",

    "<S> , we derive separate relations for the forward and backward propagating fields @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 . with the help of ( [ rel1 ] ) and ( [ rec1 ] ) and the fact that @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the transmission coefficient of the slab to be @xmath31 here we have introduced the @xmath32-polynomial that is calculated as @xmath33 similarly , using ( [ rel1 ] ) , ( [ rel2 ] ) and ( [ rec2 ] ) we derive the reflection coefficient @xmath34 equations  ( [ transmission ] ) and ( [ reflection ] ) enable direct calculation of the transmission and reflection coefficients of an arbitrarily thick metamaterial in terms of the transmission and reflection coefficients of an _ isolated _ monolayer of the metamaterial . for @xmath35 , </S>",

    "<S> this is done by selecting some non - trivial nanoscatterers , such as nanoshells ( figure  [ fig3]a ) , nanorings ( figure  [ fig4]a ) and nanodimers ( figure  [ fig5]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> these nanoscatterers are considered to compose stacks of two - dimensional periodic arrays that are embedded in a dielectric host medium of refractive index 1.5 . </S>",
    "<S> the necessary transmission and reflection coefficients for a single array are calculated using the computer software comsol multiphysics . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained coefficients are then used in ( [ transmission ] ) and ( [ reflection ] ) to acquire the transmission and reflection coefficients for several layers . </S>",
    "<S> these coefficients are compared with the results of direct numerical calculations of the whole stack with comsol . </S>",

    "<S> the calculated transmission and reflection spectra in the wavelength range from 500 to 1000  nm for the nanoshell slab are shown in figure  [ fig3]b . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra obtained by using ( [ transmission ] ) and ( [ reflection ] ) are in a very good agreement with the direct numerical calculations , indicating that the plane - wave description of the light propagation is appropriate and that the evanescent - wave coupling between the layers is indeed weak . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed description of the influence of this coupling on the transmission and reflection spectra is presented later on in the paper .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig5 ] ]    as a final example , we consider a bifacial metamaterial slab that exhibits strong spatial dispersion . </S>",

    "<S> these nanodimers have been shown to exhibit complete suppression of the electric dipole excitation in a narrow wavelength range when illuminated from the smaller disc side @xcite . however , in a metamaterial , there will be two counter - propagating waves and the electric dipole moment can not be suppressed for both of them simultaneously @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> as a consequence of the asymmetry of the unit cell , we calculate the single layer response to illumination from both sides in order to obtain the reflection coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ fig5]b shows that while the theory very accurately resolves all spectral features , there is a slight deviation of the analytically obtained values from the exact numerical values for the wavelengths around 600  nm . this deviation obviously originates from the evanescent - wave coupling between the adjacent layers . </S>",
    "<S> however , considering that the gap size between the discs in the adjacent layers is only 20  nm , the agreement is still remarkably good . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained a similar good agreement between our theory and the numerical calculations also for angles of incidence of 0 , 30 and 60 degrees as well as for the te - polarization . </S>",

    "<S> the reflection coefficient significantly decreases at around the electric dipole suppression wavelength of 618  nm .    using ( [ rel1])-([rec2 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , one can retrieve the electric and magnetic fields at any point inside the metamaterial and use them to directly extract the effective wave parameters , such as the refractive index and wave impedance . as an example , consider a non - chiral centrosymmetric material , for which @xmath55 and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> propagation of a plane wave over a single unit cell in the homogenized material must satisfy @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the @xmath10 component of the effective propagation constant and @xmath9 is the unit - cell size in the @xmath10 direction . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ rec1 ] ) then leads to the following expression @xmath59 where @xmath60 is an integer . </S>",
    "<S> the effective refractive index is related to the wave vector @xmath61 in the host medium through @xmath62 which follows from the phase matching condition @xmath63 ; @xmath64 is the wave number in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the effective wave impedance can be obtained by considering the spatially averaged electric and magnetic fields between the sheets introduced in figure  [ fig1 ] . since in the host medium the fields are right - handed , the total electric field component that is transverse to @xmath10 is @xmath65 , whereas the transverse magnetic field component is @xmath66[k_z / k]^{p}/z$ ] , with @xmath67 denoting the te- and tm - polarizations , respectively . here </S>",

    "<S> one can also obtain the corresponding relative electric permittivity and magnetic permeability as @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the wave impedance in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> it can be verified that the expressions for @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are in full agreement with the commonly used expressions introduced in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the derivations above can be repeated also for more complex materials , with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 calculated for the nanoring material of figure [ fig4 ] are shown in figure  [ fig7 ] , for @xmath39 and te polarization . </S>",
    "<S> this example is of interest in view of the possibility to tune @xmath77 and @xmath78 , because the rings are somewhat similar to traditional split - ring resonators . </S>",
    "<S> a strong electric - dipole resonance at around @xmath83  nm is observed in the spectra of @xmath77 and @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the modification of @xmath80 in this spectral range is not large and can be interpreted as a result of the finite periodicity @xmath9 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . at wavelengths shorter than @xmath84  nm </S>",
    "<S> , the behavior of @xmath79 resembles that of a drude metal . </S>",
    "<S> a thick nanoring material could therefore have a high reflectivity in this region , which is supported by the values of the wave impedance . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting , however , that at @xmath85  nm the material is characterized by @xmath86 and @xmath87 , leading to an efficient suppression of both optical reflection and refraction at an air - metamaterial interface .    . </S>",
    "<S> a te - polarized wave propagating at @xmath39 in the host medium is considered.[fig7 ] ]    the accuracy of the presented theory depends on the extent of the evanescent waves produced by the nanoparticle layers . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , for the theory to be exact , the evanescent waves associated with the cut - off diffraction orders must have a decay length that is much shorter than the spacing between the particles in two adjacent layers . for a two - dimensional square array of period @xmath88 , </S>",

    "<S> in fact , if for subwavelength - sized unit cells we have @xmath104 , ( [ crit ] ) yields @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> in this case the criterion for neglecting the interlayer evanescent - wave coupling becomes @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> then , as a practical criterion for when our theory can be applied , we require that @xmath107 .    in order to verify the above predictions on the influence of the interlayer evanescent - wave coupling </S>",
    "<S> , we numerically calculate the transmission through the nanodimer slab , while varying the transverse and longitudinal periods separately . in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6]a the transmission coefficient is plotted for an increasing longitudinal period @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse period is fixed to @xmath109  nm in order to have the evanescent - wave coupling significant enough to cause a discrepancy at small @xmath108 between the theory and the numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that when @xmath95 exceeds @xmath110 [ @xmath108 exceeds 80  nm ] , this discrepancy disappears . the transmission coefficient for an increasing transverse period @xmath88 </S>",
    "<S> is shown in figure  [ fig6]b . </S>",
    "<S> in this case the longitudinal period is fixed to @xmath111  nm , such that the evanescent - wave coupling is negligible at @xmath101  nm . as the transverse period is increased , the discrepancy between the theory and the numerical results starts to appear due to an increase in the evanescent - wave coupling between the layers . </S>",
    "<S> we notice however that as @xmath112 is increased , the array also gets sparse , which reduces the influence of the nanoscatterers on the propagating wave . </S>",
    "<S> this effect counterbalances the growing decay length of the evanescent waves produced by the nanoparticle layers , such that the discrepancy between the theory and the numerical results remains small .     </S>",

    "<S> are shown along with the analytical results ( circles and stars ) obtained from ( [ transmission ] ) and ( [ reflection]).[fig6 ] ]    for a metamaterial slab , in which the evanescent wave coupling is negligible , one can introduce effective material parameters . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , if the evanescent wave coupling exists , these parameters depend on the slab thickness and are thereby senseless @xcite . by using ( [ transmission ] ) and ( [ reflection ] ) to compare the transmission and reflection coefficients of a single nanoscatterer layer with those of two layers , one can directly assess whether the metamaterial is homogenizable and , consequently , whether the introduction of material parameters is justified .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a simple analytical theory for the description of light interaction with optical metamaterials . recognizing the subwavelength size of the metamaterial s unit cells </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the evanescent - wave coupling between adjacent monolayers of the metamaterial does not significantly influence the light propagation in the material . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence , arbitrarily thick metamaterial slabs can be accurately described in terms of the plane - wave transmission characteristics obtained for a single isolated monolayer , e.g. , numerically . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have shown that one can evaluate the fields at any point inside the material and , consequently , obtain the effective wave parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the presented examples of rigorous numerical calculations demonstrate the wide applicability of this remarkably simple analytical model .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to existing theoretical approaches , our one also correctly describes three - dimensional arrays of bifacial nanoscatterers , which is of practical importance for a large variety of metamaterials , such as those with asymmetric unit cells . for homogenizable metamaterial slabs , </S>",
    "<S> our method enables rapid one - layer - based extraction of the transmission and reflection coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , propagation of an optical beam through such a metamaterial can be described by using the angular spectrum representation with our model applied to each plane - wave component .    </S>",
    "<S> the introduced theory is not limited to optical metamaterials , but can also be applied to study wave propagation in other artificial media , such as radio - frequency and terahertz metamaterials , and even phononic metamaterials . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the presented theory has the necessary simplicity and accuracy to accelerate the development of optical metamaterials tailored for real applications .    </S>",
