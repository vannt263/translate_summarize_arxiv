    "gamow @xcite and pontecorvo @xcite were the first to recognize the important role played by neutrinos in the evolution of stars .",
    "the neutrino emission processes may affect the properties of matter at high temperatures , and hence affect stellar evolution .    on the other hand , when a massive star collapses in an explosion of a supernova , almost @xmath1 of the energy released comes out in the form of neutrinos , with only @xmath2 coming out as light .",
    "many of these neutrinos have energies of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "this results in much more neutrinos being produced in a few seconds that all those released in the rest of the star life time .",
    "these neutrinos are produced in all flavors @xmath4 and about the same number of particles than antiparticles . among the material ejected during the explosion",
    "there are heavy elements that are important for the stellar evolution of galaxies , stars , planets and life .",
    "other supernovas can create neutron stars , remnants or even black holes depending on the mass of the star .",
    "in general , the neutrinos radiated by the supernovas carry in their spectrum key information not only about the detailed nature of the supernova collapse but also about properties of neutrinos , not yet explored in the laboratories @xcite .",
    "this is one reason why it is important to study the stellar energy loss rates due to neutrino pair production in annihilation @xmath0 .",
    "neutrino emission is known to play an important role in stellar evolution , especially in the late stages when the rate of evolution is almost fully dependent on the energy loss via neutrinos .",
    "this refers to the stage of steady burning prior to the implosion of the stellar core , to the process of catastrophic core - collapse , and to the cooling of the neutron star which is formed .    the stellar energy loss rate due to neutrino emission receives contributions from both , weak nuclear reactions and purely leptonic processes .",
    "however , for the large values of density and temperature which characterize the final stage of stellar evolution , the latter are largely dominant , and are mainly produced by four possible interaction mechanisms @xcite :    @xmath5    actually these processes are the dominant cause of the energy loss rate in different regions in a density - temperature plane . for very large core temperature , @xmath6 @xmath7 , and not excessively high values of density ,",
    "pair annihilations are most efficient , while @xmath8 photoproduction gives the leading contribution for @xmath9 @xmath7 @xmath10 @xmath7 and relatively low density , @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 . these are the typical ranges for very massive stars in their late evolution @xcite .    the standard model ( sm ) @xcite of the electroweak interactions is the starting point of all the extended gauge models . in other words ,",
    "any gauge group with physical sense must have as a subgroup the @xmath14 group of the standard model .",
    "the purpose of the extended theories is to explain some fundamental aspects which are not clarified in the frame of the sm .",
    "one of these aspects is the origin of parity violation at current energies .",
    "the left - right symmetric models ( lrsm ) based on the @xmath15 gauge group @xcite give an answer to that problem , since they restore the parity symmetry at high energies and give their violations at low energies as a result of the breaking of gauge symmetry .",
    "detailed discussions on the left - right symmetric model can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 model @xcite , also called 331 model is one of the most simplest and attractive extensions of the sm . in the literature",
    "@xcite there are different versions of this model which are characterized by the parameter @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the different models with different choices of @xmath19 have new particles with different electric charges .",
    "however , in general these models have the same characteristics , that is to say : 1 ) unlike the sm that anomaly cancellation is fulfilled within each generation , the gauge anomaly is cancelled in the 331 model when considering all the generations .",
    "the number of generations @xmath20 must be a multiple of three . on the other hand , in order to ensure @xmath21 an asymptotic free theory , @xmath20 has to be smaller than six .",
    "so the number of generations @xmath20 is equal to three , which explains why the sm has three generations .",
    "2 ) one of the three quark generations is different from the other two , making sure that the anomaly is free , which leads to tree - level flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) through a new neutral gauge boson @xmath22 or the mixing @xmath23 .",
    "3 ) peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry @xcite which can solve the strong cp problem is a natural result of gauge invariance in the 331 model @xcite .",
    "4 ) as a consequence of the extended gauge sector , the 331 model contains a much broader spectrum of particles than the sm : more heavy quarks or leptons , more gauge bosons and more higgs scalars .",
    "this may change the sm phenomenology significantly and lead to interesting signatures at the current and future colliders such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite and the compact linear collider ( clic ) @xcite .",
    "the existence of a heavy neutral ( @xmath22 ) vector boson is a feature of many extensions of the standard model .",
    "in particular , one ( or more ) additional @xmath24 gauge factor provides one of the simplest extensions of the sm .",
    "additional @xmath22 gauge bosons appear in grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite , superstring theories @xcite , left - right symmetric models ( lrsm ) @xcite 331 model @xcite and in other models such as models of composite gauge bosons @xcite . in particular , it is possible to study some phenomenological features associates with this extra neutral gauge boson through little higgs model .",
    "many little higgs models have been proposed in the literature ; however the littlest higgs model ( lh ) proposed by n. arkani - hamed , _",
    "@xcite , provides one of the most economical implementations and forms the basis for most phenomenological analysis .",
    "the lh model @xcite has been proposed for solving the little hierarchy problem . in this scenario ,",
    "the higgs boson is regarded as a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson associated with a global symmetry at some higher scale . though the symmetry is not exact , its breaking",
    "is specially arranged to cancel quadratically divergent corrections to the higgs mass term at 1-loop level .",
    "this is called the little higgs mechanism . as a result",
    ", the scale of new physics can be as high as 10 @xmath25 without a fine - tuning on the higgs mass term . among various little higgs models , the simplest little higgs model ( slh )",
    "@xcite is attractive due to its relatively simple theory structure .",
    "detailed discussions on the little higgs models are reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "our main objective in this work is to provide suitable expressions for the stellar energy loss rates of pair production of neutrinos via the process @xmath26 in the context of three models , a 331 model ( 331 m ) @xcite , a left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) @xcite and the simplest little higgs model ( slhm ) @xcite .",
    "these will be expressed in a form which can be easily incorporated into realistic supernova models .",
    "these models have the interesting feature that they are independent of the mass of the new additional @xmath22 heavy gauge boson , and only depend on the mixing angles @xmath27 and @xmath28 of the 331 m and lrsm and of the characteristic energy scale @xmath29 of the slhm besides the sm parameters .",
    "for this reason , we chose these models to calculate the stellar energy loss rates of neutrinos in supernova .",
    "the neutrinos play a crucial role for the understanding of core - collapse supernova in terms of heating and cooling of supernova matter as well as for the incompletely known supernova explosion mechanism @xcite .",
    "the long term neutrino signal of the deleptonizing / cooling nascent protoneutron star , which is to say after the supernova explosion has been launched , was reviewed in refs .",
    "both studies are milestones of consistent simulations of supernova explosions and represent standard works in the field of core - collapse supernova modeling .",
    "the associated long - term neutrino signal @xmath30 seconds is relevant for supernova neutrino detection , for recent insights see ref .",
    "detailed analyses regarding the neutrino spectra formation and evolution including the neutrino - energy hierarchy can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "stellar energy loss rates data have been used to put constraints on the properties and interaction of light particles @xcite .",
    "in addition , one of the most interesting possibilities to use stars as particle physics laboratories @xcite is to study the backreaction of the novel energy loss rates implied by the existence of new low - mass particles such as axions @xcite , or by non - standard neutrino properties such as magnetic moment and electric dipole moment @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we present the calculation of the stellar energy loss rates of the process @xmath26 for our three models . in sect .",

    "6 we show the relative change for the regions i and ii          from this figure it is clear that the relative correction reaches its maximum value between @xmath196 , and is of the order of @xmath197 with respect to the standard model @xcite , and decreases rapidly for large @xmath29 . the curves also demonstrate that the effect of the slhm is not sensitive to @xmath29 in the range of @xmath198 .",

    "the relative correction is sensitive to the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the models considered .",
    "however , there are other effects which may change the stellar energy loss rates , for example , the radiative corrections at one - loop level .",
    "we conclude that the energy loss via @xmath200 pairs is relevant at the moment of collapse when thermal process become extremely important .",
    "even when the stellar energy loss is dominated by heavy lepton flavor neutrinos , the energy loss is higher in general for the threes extensions of the standard model , being maximum for the simplest little higgs model ( slhm ) , up to @xmath197 in comparison with the sm .",
    "it is worth mentioning that at the present time an enhancement or suppression of individual weak rates on the order of @xmath197 can not be identified .",
    "this means that it will leave no imprint in neither the supernova dynamics nor the potentially observable neutrino signal .",
    "therefore , some sm weak rates uncertainties can be as large as one order of magnitude at some specific conditions , mainly due to the unknown state of matter of the supernova medium in particular at high matter density .",
    "this can be improved considering that the analytical approximation for the fermi integrals must be performed for various limits regions of high matter density and then evaluating the relative correction @xmath201 .    in conclusion ,",
    "in this article we determine exact and approximate analytical expressions for the stellar energy loss rates through the process @xmath26 : in the context of a 331 m , a lrsm and the slhm . in addition , we study the contributions of the parameters of these models through the relative correction and for different limiting cases as is mentioned in the text .",
    "we find that the stellar energy loss rates is almost independent of the mixing angle @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 of each considered model in the allowed range for these parameters . as expected , in the decoupling limit , when @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 , the expression for the stellar energy loss rates @xmath205 of the sm previously obtained in the literature @xcite is recovered .",
