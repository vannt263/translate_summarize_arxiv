    "the fourier analysis has long been one of the most important methods in various fields of study . among them , randomly varying data are efficiently analyzed by fourier transform methods , or spectral methods . in random processes as functions of time , the fourier transform plays one of the central roles in unveiling the statistical nature of the process @xcite .",
    "a random process is represented by a random function defined over 1-dimensional space .",
    "generalizations to multi - dimensional spaces are straightforward , and random functions defined over some space are called random fields @xcite .",
    "a random field is called _ homogeneous _ when all the statistical properties are translationally invariant and independent on a position in space .",
    "in a one - dimensional case , such as a random process , homogeneous random fields are also called _",
    "stationary_. fourier analyses of random processes or random fields are especially useful when they are stationary or homogeneous .",
    "there is a class of random fields which are called gaussian random fields .",
    "when a field arises from the superposition of a large number of independent random effects , the resulting field is a gaussian random field under very weak conditions , by virtue of the so - called _ central limit theorem_. there are many situations encountered in physical and engineering problems that random fields are accurately or approximately gaussian .",
    "statistical properties of a homogeneous gaussian random field is completely specified by a correlation function , or equivalently , its fourier transform , a power spectrum .",
    "therefore , gaussian random fields are analytically easier to treat than other random fields , and many aspects of gaussian random fields have been investigated before @xcite .    in cosmological physics ,",
    "gaussian random fields are very important , since the initial density fluctuations are thought to be , at least approximately , a gaussian random field . in inflationary models , the curvature perturbations generated by quantum fluctuations in the very early universe would yield a gaussian random density field",
    ". statistics of gaussian random fields in cosmological contexts have been explored in detail @xcite .    however , non - gaussianity naturally appears in reality , especially when nonlinear dynamics are involved .",
    "while linear evolution of an initial density field in cosmology keeps the gaussianity , nonlinear evolution raises non - gaussianity in the density field @xcite . moreover , whether or not the initial density field is a gaussian random field is an important question to investigate the beginning of the universe , and understanding non - gaussian random fields has a great importance .",
    "the non - gaussian features in fourier analyses are usually characterized by polyspectra , i.e. , higher - order counterparts of the power spectra . for a given set of random variables , a set of all moments of the variables carries complete information of the statistical distribution .",
    "however , it is still not trivial to understand the statistical properties of the fourier modes , even when a hierarchy of all the polyspectra are known .",
    "for example , statistical behaviors of fourier phases in non - gaussian random fields has long been studied empirically , lacking any well - established statistical framework to understand information contained in the fourier phases @xcite .",
    "the statistical structures of fourier phases are recently unveiled by the present author , properly calculating the joint distribution function of phases @xcite .",
    "the analytical results are tested against numerical simulations of cosmological structure formation @xcite , and applied to an analysis of observational data @xcite .",
    "the analytical calculations involve an expansion by a certain parameter , and only lowest - order terms were discussed in the previous work .    in this paper ,",
    "the previous analytical calculations are extended to give a framework for studying statistics of fourier modes in general .",
    "the statistical structures of not only fourier phases but also fourier moduli are simultaneously considered .",
    "we give a general joint distribution function of fourier modes in general non - gaussian fields .",
    "the joint distribution function of fourier modes has complete information of statistical properties .",
    "since a set of all the polyspectra also has the complete information , the joint distribution function can , in principle , be expressible by a set of all the polyspectra .",
    "such relation has not been known , and it is surely difficult to obtain the complete relation .",
    "however , the distribution function is found to inevitably depend on a total volume in which fourier transforms are applied .",
    "some dimensionless combinations of a polyspectrum and a total volume , each of which is a dimensional quantity , can actually be arbitrary small for a large volume limit .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expand the distribution function by some powers of a volume .",
    "the expression is found to be expanded by an inverse of square root of the volume as a small parameter . the way to calculate the distribution function up to arbitrary order",
    "is established in this paper . the general expression up to second order",
    "is actually given .",
    "more general properties involving higher - order effects are also obtained and discussed in some cases .",
