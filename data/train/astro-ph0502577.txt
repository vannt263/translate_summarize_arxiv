    "soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are high - energy sources characterized by sporadic periods of activity in which they emit short bursts ( @xmath81  s ) with energy up to @xmath110@xmath9 erg .",
    "they are believed to be highly magnetized ( b@xmath1010@xmath11 g ) neutron stars , or  magnetars  ( see woods & thompson 2004 for a recent review ) .",
    "large soft @xmath12-ray flares , reaching peak luminosities above several 10@xmath13 erg s@xmath14 and lasting a few minutes , have been observed from two sgrs : on 1979 march 5 from sgr 052566 ( mazets et al .",
    "1979 ) and on 1998 august 27 from sgr 1900@xmath1514 ( hurley et al . 1999 ; feroci et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the detection of only two of such giant flares from different sources in about 30 years implies that these events , involving energy releases of more than 10@xmath13 ergs , are relatively rare .",
    "is currently the most prolific of the four known sgrs",
    ". its level of activity has been increasing in the last few years , during which many bursts have been detected with different satellites , including rxte ( g \" o \" u et al . 2001 ; ibrahim et al .",
    "2003 ; woods et al .",
    "2004 ) and integral ( gtz et al . 2004 ) . on 2004",
    "october 5 two clusters of strong bursts with a total fluence of @xmath110@xmath16 erg @xmath4 were emitted within a time span of a few minutes ( mereghetti et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it was noted ( golenetskii et al .",
    "2004 ) that a similar event occurred in sgr 1900@xmath1514 three months before its 1998 giant flare ( aptekar et al .",
    "the increasing level of activity in  was also reflected in the properties of its quiescent x  ray emission .",
    "xmm - newton observations showed that its 2 - 10 kev luminosity doubled and the spectrum became harder in 2004 ( mereghetti et al .",
    "a similar trend was present in the persistent 20 - 150 kev emission discovered with integral observations carried out in 2003 - 2004 ( mereghetti et al .",
    "2005a ) .    the energetic activity of  culminated on 2004 december 27 , when the integral satellite discovered the first giant outburst from this source ( borkowski et al .",
    "more than twenty satellites recorded this exceptional event which started with a hard pulse so intense to saturate most detectors ( hurley et al . 2005 ; mazets et al . 2005 ; palmer et al .",
    "2005 ; terasawa et al . 2005 ) and to significantly ionize the earth s upper atmosphere ( campbell et al .",
    "here we report the properties of this giant outburst derived with the anti - coincidence shield ( acs ) of the spectrometer on board integral ( spi , vedrenne et al .",
    "the acs consists of 91 bismuth germanate ( bgo ) scintillator crystals of thickness between 16 and 50 mm and with a total mass of 512 kg . besides serving as a veto for the spi germanium spectrometer ,",
    "the acs is able to detect gamma - ray bursts from a large fraction of the sky ( von kienlin et al .",
    "the data used here consist of the overall acs count rate ( i.e. the read out from the sum of the 91 crystals ) sampled in time intervals of 50 ms .",
    "no energy or directional information is available .",
    "the acs is sensitive to photons above a low - energy threshold corresponding to approximately 80 kev .",
    "however , due to the different properties of the various bgo blocks , their associated photomultipliers , and the chosen redundancy concept ( the signals from two different crystals are fed to the same front - end electronics ) , this threshold is not sharp and its exact value not well determined .",
    "dead time and saturation effects in the crystals and electronics are negligible ( @xmath81% ) for total count rates smaller than a few 10@xmath17 cts s@xmath14 .",
    "when this condition is verified we can easily convert the observed count rates to an incident energy flux , assuming a spectral shape and knowing the acs effective area .",
    "the latter is a function of the incidence angle , with a maximum for directions nearly orthogonal to the satellite pointing axis and unobstructed by other instruments . at the time of",
    "the flare was at a zenith angle @xmath18=106@xmath19 from the spi pointing axis and at an azimuth angle @xmath20=9@xmath19 ( @xmath20=0@xmath19 corresponds to the satellite sun - pointing side , i.e. the direction from spi toward the ibis instrument ) .",
    "the acs effective area as a function of energy for this direction has been computed by means of monte carlo simulations based on detailed mass modelling ( weidenspointner et al .",
    "2003 , and references therein ) of spi and of the surrounding material ( satellite structure and other instruments ) .",
    "the effective area increases monotonically with energy ; it is @xmath1340 @xmath21 at 100 kev , @xmath11150 @xmath21 at 200 kev , and larger than 3000 @xmath21 above 1 mev . thus the acs provides the data with the best statistics in the soft @xmath12-ray range available for this giant flare . for an optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum with kt@xmath22=30 kev",
    "we obtain a conversion factor of 1 acs count s@xmath14 @xmath14.3@xmath23 erg @xmath4 s@xmath14 ( 80 - 2000 kev ) .",
    "the total light curve of the flare , obtained by binning at 2.5 s the original acs data , is shown in fig .",
    "[ total ] , while fig .",
    "[ initialfit ] displays at full resolution ( 50 ms ) the initial part of the pulsating tail .",
    "we have defined t=0 at 21:30:26.55 ut of 2004 december 27 , approximately coinciding with the rise time of the flare .",
    "the giant flare starts with a short and extremely intense spike10@xmath24 counts s@xmath14 to better show the flare tail ] . the measured count rate at the peak , @xmath25 counts s@xmath14 , is strongly affected by dead time and saturation effects which can not be easily modelled and prevent reliable flux estimates .",
    "a fit with a constant to the count rate in a 2 ks long time interval before the flare yields a count rate of @xmath18.8@xmath2610@xmath27 counts s@xmath14 , which we use in the following analysis as a constant background level and include in all the fits keeping its value fixed .    a narrow burst , lasting @xmath10.2 s , occurs at t=2.8 s ( see fig .  [ initialfit ] ) .",
    "since this delay corresponds to the time taken by the wavefront to travel from integral to the moon and back to the satellite , this burst can be explained as backscattered radiation of the initial spike .",
    "a similar detection was reported with the helicon - coronas - f satellite , which could not observe directly  due to earth occultation ( mazets et al . 2005 ) .",
    "assuming for the backscattered radiation the spectral shape derived by the above authors ( dn / de@xmath28e@xmath29 exp(e/800 kev ) ) , we obtain a fluence of @xmath12@xmath30 erg @xmath4 ( e@xmath780 kev ) .",
    "the duration and the fluence of the backscattered radiation are consistent with the properties of the initial spike ( mazets et al . 2005 ; hurley et al .",
    "2005 ; terasawa et al . 2005 ) .    the inset of fig .",
    "[ total ] shows the light curve of the precursor burst which occurred 143  s before the flare .",
    "triangulation analysis , using the acs light curve together with data from other satellites , demonstrates that its arrival direction is consistent with the position of  ( hurley et al .",
    "the above authors , using the rhessi satellite , found that the precursor spectrum can be crudely approximated by a thermal bremsstrahlung with kt@xmath22=15 kev and reported a fluence of 1.8@xmath2610@xmath16 erg @xmath4 for e@xmath73 kev . assuming the same spectrum , we obtain a fluence above 80 kev of 4.4@xmath2610@xmath31 erg @xmath4 , which extrapolated to lower energy overestimates the rhessi value by a factor ten .",
    "considering the uncertainties in the instruments cross calibration and the extrapolation largely dependent on the poorly determined spectrum , we do not consider this discrepancy as particularly significant .",
    "for instance , for kt@xmath22=30 kev we get f(@xmath780 kev)=4.0@xmath2610@xmath31 erg @xmath4 and f(@xmath73 kev)=10@xmath16 erg @xmath4 .",
    "the phase of the event rise time with respect to the 7.56 s pulsations0.1 s , we adopt the more precise value obtained with rxte ( woods et al . 2005 ) and define phase @xmath20=0 at t=0 s ] is @xmath320.1 , which does not correspond to any of the peaks seen in the pulsating tail .    the transition from the initial spike to the pulsating tail",
    "is well fitted , in the time interval 1.22.2 s , by a power law function f@xmath28t@xmath33 with @xmath34=2.1@xmath350.1 ( fig .",
    "[ initialfit ] ) .",
    "the broad bump in the time range @xmath125 s , as well as the following ones after t=10 s , are in phase with the main peak of the 7.56 s pulsations ( @xmath20=0.350.6 ) and can therefore be considered as the first appearance of the periodicity .",
    "the average profile of the pulsations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fol757-aver ] for different time intervals .",
    "an evolution of the profile during the flare , with the relative intensity of the peak at @xmath20=0.75 increasing with time , is evident .    to characterize the long - term decay profile removing the effect of the pulsations , we binned the data in time intervals of 7.56 s. the resulting light curve ( inset of fig .  [ initialfit ] )",
    "is well fitted in the time interval t@xmath115400 s by an exponential function with decay constant @xmath36=138@xmath355 s. note that the first bin ( t=7.5616.2 s ) does not contain the initial hard spike .",
    "nevertheless it lies significantly above the fitted function . assuming a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum with kt@xmath22=30 kev , similar to the giant flares tails of other sgrs , the fluence in the time interval 1400 s is @xmath12.6@xmath2610@xmath16 erg @xmath4 for e@xmath780 kev . extrapolating the same spectral shape to lower energy",
    ", this corresponds to f(@xmath73 kev)@xmath16.4@xmath2610@xmath37 erg @xmath4 .",
    "our data show evidence for a second , separate component in addition to the main flare discussed above . after the end of the pulsating tail , at t@xmath1400 s , the count rate increases again , forming a long bump which peaks around t@xmath1600800 s and returns to the pre - flare background level at t@xmath13000 - 4000 s ( see fig .",
    "[ longlongtail ] ) .",
    "the acs count rate is dominated by the incident flux of charged particles which varies on different time scales , due to the satellite motion and to the temporal and spatial variations in the flux of cosmic rays and trapped radiation .",
    "a long term acs light curve covering almost one day and including the  giant flare is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ psac ] . for comparison , the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ psac ] shows the light curve obtained in the same time interval with the plastic scintillator anti - coincidence ( psac ) , a thin ( 5 mm ) detector located just below the spi coded mask aperture , which is sensitive to charged particles and almost completely transparent to hard x  ray photons .",
    "it can be noted that both the long term trend and most of the fluctuations on shorter time scales are present in both detectors , as expected for charged particle induced background . on the contrary ,",
    "the bump at t=4004000 s is prominent only in the acs , indicating its hard x ",
    "rays nature .",
    "known variable sources , like e.g. cyg x1 , are not bright enough in the hard x ",
    "rays to produce the count rate excess seen in the acs , and no new transients were reported at the time of this observation .",
    "we also checked that the sun was not particularly active in x ",
    "rays , by looking at the publicly available data of the goes satellites .",
    "we therefore conclude that the re - brightening after t=400 s and lasting about one hour is associated with . to our knowledge , this component has not been reported using data from other satellites . this might be due to background variability and source occultation effects in low earth orbit satellites and to the lack of sufficient sensitivity at hard x  rays in other detectors .",
    "after accounting for the background , estimated from a linear fit to the acs count rate for t@xmath80 s and t@xmath74000 s , the time profile decay in the interval t=500 - 4000 s can be reasonably well described as a power law f@xmath28t@xmath33 with @xmath380.85 .",
    "the fluence in the 400 - 4000 s time interval is approximately equal to that contained in the pulsating tail ( t=1400 s ) .",
    "the most striking difference between the 2004 december 27 outburst of  and the giant flares previously observed from sgr 052666 and sgr 1900@xmath1514 is the global energetics of the event . for a distance of 15 kpc ( corbel & eikenberry 2004 ) , the hard x  ray fluence in the  initial spike ( hurley et al .",
    "2005 ; terasawa et al . 2005 ) implies an isotropic - equivalent energy release of several 10@xmath39  d@xmath40 erg .",
    "this is at least two orders of magnitude larger than that of the two other giant flares ( 1.6@xmath5 erg for sgr 052626 ; @xmath41 erg for sgr 1900@xmath1514 ) . the much higher involved energy is also reflected in the properties of the transient radio emission , which reached a luminosity a factor 500 ( cameron et al .",
    "2005 , gaensler et al . 2005 ) larger than that seen in sgr 1900@xmath1514 after the 27 august 1998 event ( frail et al . 1999 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy output in the  pulsating tail ( 1.6@xmath5  d@xmath40 erg for e@xmath73 kev ) is similar to that of sgr 1900@xmath1514 ( 5@xmath42 erg ) and of sgr 052666 ( 4@xmath5 erg ) .",
    "the giant flare of  is thus characterized by a much higher spike - to - tail energy ratio ( @xmath0100 ) than the two previous events ( @xmath11 ) . according to the magnetar model ,",
    "essentially all the energy release occurs during the initial @xmath10.2 s transient phase , when a hot relativistic fireball is launched .",
    "a fraction of this energy is trapped by closed field lines in the neutron star magnetosphere , forming an optically thick photon - pair plasma which evaporates giving rise to the radiation observed in the pulsating tail ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) .",
    "the magnetic field strength limits the amount of energy that can be confined .",
    "the fact that this quantity is similar in the three giant flares , despite the much higher total energy release of , is consistent with a magnetic field of the same order in the three magnetars .",
    "the pulse profile and its time evolution observed with the acs are similar to those seen with rhessi and swift ( hurley et al .",
    "2005 ; palmer et al . 2005 ) , which are dominated by photons of lower energy .",
    "thanks to the large effective area above 100 kev of the acs , we can clearly see variations in the pulse profile at high energies .",
    "the different evolution of the emission components visible in the pulsating tail ( see fig .  [ fol757-aver ] ) suggests separate emission regions .",
    "it is interesting to note that the pulsations are present since the very early phase of the flare , as indicated by the broad pulse visible at t=25 s ( fig .",
    "[ initialfit ] ) .",
    "this pulse persists at the same rotational phase in the following cycles , while a secondary peak at @xmath320.75 gradually emerges .",
    "while the above results are similar to those obtained with other satellites , our data provide unique evidence for a second , long lasting component in the hard x  ray light curve .",
    "the emission after t@xmath1400 s could originate from the neutron star surface and/or magnetosphere or , alternatively , from the interaction of the relativistic fireball with the surrounding medium . a search for pulsations in the acs data after t=400 s gave a negative result , favoring the second interpretation .",
    "the afterglow produced by the  giant flare has been observed in the radio band ( gaensler et al . 2005 ; cameron et al .",
    "2005 ) , yielding estimates of the minimum energy in magnetic field and relativistic particles , e , of several 10@xmath43 erg ( see also nakar , piran & sari 2005 ) .",
    "the hard x  ray fluence in the 400 - 3000 s time interval is consistent with this value . with simple gamma - ray burst afterglow models based on synchrotron emission we can estimate the bulk lorentz factor @xmath44 from the time t@xmath45 of the afterglow onset : @xmath4615 ( e / 5 10@xmath43  erg)@xmath47 ( n / 0.1 cm@xmath37)@xmath49 ( t@xmath45 / 100 s)@xmath50 , where n is the ambient density ( see , e.g. zhang & meszaros 2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "this is smaller than the typical values for gamma - ray bursts , but consistent , considering the large involved uncertainties , with the mildly relativistic outflow inferred from the modelling of the radio data ( granot et al .",
    "alternatively , the observed re - brightening could be due to an inverse compton component , implying a high density environment ( n@xmath010 cm@xmath37 ) and a high electron radiation efficiency .",
