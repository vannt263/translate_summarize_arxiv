    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are off - nuclear compact x - ray sources whose luminosities exceed the eddington limit ( @xmath3  erg  s@xmath4 ) of a 20 @xmath5 black hole .",
    "thus ulxs may be intermediate - mass black holes that bridge the gap between stellar - mass and supermassive black holes @xcite or stellar - mass black holes with beamed emission @xcite or in super eddington accretion states @xcite",
    ". please see @xcite for a comprehensive review .",
    "the accretion disk and the companion star could both contribute to the optical flux of ulxs .",
    "determination of which component is dominant should help understand the physical nature of ulxs .",
    "if the optical light is dominated by the companion star , then the flux should be steady and the spectrum should match that of known stars . in this case , the black hole mass may be obtained via optical radial velocity measurements .",
    "if the accretion disk emits most of the optical light , then optical variability is expected and the spectra would likely be similar to those of low - mass x - ray binaries . for a few ulxs ,",
    "multiwavelength spectra have been employed to distinguish stellar versus disk emission @xcite .",
    "holmberg ii x-1 has a bolometric luminosity up to @xmath6  erg  s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is surrounded by optical and radio nebulae @xcite and has a distance of 3.05 mpc @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the optical emission lines demonstrates that the optical nebula is x - ray photoionized @xcite .",
    "the true x - ray luminosity of holmberg ii x-1 inferred from the flux of high - ionization lines in the nebula , he  ii and [ o  iv ] , is similar to that estimated directly from the x - ray observations assuming little beaming and is truly in the ultraluminous regime @xcite .",
    "a point - like optical counterpart to holmberg ii x-1 is detected within the nebula .",
    "its absolute magnitude @xmath7 and @xmath8 color are similar to stars with spectral types between o4v and b3ib @xcite . moreover , the uv fluxes observed by the xmm - newton / optical monitor ( om ) and galex are consistent with a b2ib supergiant @xcite , although due to the poor spatial resolution of the om and galex , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) obtained by @xcite may be highly contaminated by the nebula and nearby stars ( see figure  [ fig : img ] ) .",
    "holmberg ii x-1 exhibits only moderate optical variability , thus a stellar origin of optical flux is consistent with the uv and optical results to date .",
    "however , the optical flux of most ulxs appears to be dominated by an x - ray irradiated disk @xcite . here , we present new results on the ultraviolet spectrum of holmberg ii x-1 and combine them with previous results on broadband optical photometry and x - ray spectroscopy to attempt to determine the nature of the optical / uv emission .",
    "the observations and data analysis are described in   [ sec : obs ] , and the results are discussed in   [ sec : dis ] .",
    "using sas 11.0.0 , we extracted a spectrum from xmm european photon imaging camera ( epic ) pn data obtained on april 10 , 2002 ( obsid 0112520601 ) .",
    "we found no background flares in the 10 - 15  kev light curve .",
    "the good exposure was 4.7  ks after filtering events with @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "holmberg ii x-1 appears near the ccd gap in the observation , thus the spectrum was extracted in a region centered the source with a moderately small radius of 29 .",
    "background was estimated using a circular region near the source and subtracted .",
    "the spectrum was grouped to have at least 100 counts per bin .",
    "we used observations obtained with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) to avoid nearby stars , and reduce contamination from the nebula .",
    "holmberg ii x-1 was observed using the prism grating pr130l of the solar blind channel ( sbc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on november 27 , 2006 with an exposure time of 5110  s. for comparison , we also examined an image taken with the f165lp filter ( with no prism ) .",
    "the field around the source in the f165lp filter and the pr130l prism are shown in figure  [ fig : img ] .",
    "the pr130l prism covers from @xmath11   to @xmath12  , and has a nonlinear resolution varying from @xmath13  / pixel at 1250   to @xmath14  / pixel at 1800  .",
    "the initial position of the object was taken from the direct image f165lp filter .",
    "then , using the extraction software axe 2.1 provided by space telescope science institute ( stsi ) , the spectrum was extracted with a narrow extraction aperture with a width of 8 pixels in order to exclude counts from two adjacent stars , labeled as  star 1 \" and  star 2 \" in figure  [ fig : img ] .    in order to check the spectrum extraction ,",
    "we compared with the source spectrum from the pr130l prism calculated using axe to the source flux in the f165lp filter at its pivot wavelength calculated using the calibrations in the synphot package in iraf .",
    "unexpectedly , the flux in the f165lp filter was @xmath15 larger than the flux in the pr130l spectrum from axe .",
    "the same deviation also appears upon checking another source , ngc 1313 x-2 .",
    "furthermore , when we extracted a pr130l counts spectrum using axe then converted it to flux using synphot , we found that the flux was about 30% higher than that calculated using axe directly .",
    "thus we suspect there is a systematic deviation between synphot and axe 2.1 .",
    "the flux conversion of pr130l in axe is done using sensitivity curve in @xcite , however , a new acs sbc throughput curve has been adopted in synphot @xcite .",
    "comparing the two curves , there are dramatic deviations at wavelengths below 1270   and above 1750  , and the sensitivity at 1250   is a factor of @xmath16 lower than that at 1300  .",
    "therefore , in this paper , flux conversion was performed using the newest calibration file in synphot , and we adopted 1300   as the short wavelength cut - off , and 1750   as a conservative long wavelength cut - off .",
    "we noticed that , during the review process of the paper , @xcite reported the identification of a n  v  1240  line in the same data .",
    "this feature is insignificant , more like large fluctuations around a baseline , if we use synphot to calibrate the flux .",
    "the potential large uncertainty of the sensitivity curve prevents reliable detection or characterization of any lines at these short wavelengths .    ]",
    "there are several hst optical observations of holmberg ii x-1 available .",
    "we selected acs wide field camera ( wfc ) and wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) wideband filter data : acs f814w ( i band ) data on january 28 , 2006 and december 30 , 2006 , wfpc2 f336w ( u band ) data on february 9 , 2009 ; f450w ( b band ) and f555w data ( v band ) on october 3 , 5 and 9 , 2007 . using the apphot package of iraf , we performed aperture photometry with an aperture of @xmath17 ( 4 pixels ) on the acs archival dithered images . for the wfpc2 data , point spread function ( psf ) photometry",
    "was executed on calibrated science ( c0f ) image using hstphot 1.1 .",
    "conversion to fluxes was done using synphot .",
    "the optical counterpart of holmberg ii x-1 shows moderate variability of no more than 0.07 mag , see figure  [ fig : optical ] .",
    "fitting to a constant flux in each band , the @xmath18 are 2.8 , 3.9 and 0.0 for 3 observations of f450w , 4 observations of f555w and 2 observations of f814w band .",
    "we note that the surrounding optical nebula contributes to the uncertainty in the photometry .",
    "@xcite found that the bvi fluxes for ngc 6946 ulx-1 increased by about 30% without nebular background subtraction .",
    "therefore , we compared fluxes with and without nebular subtraction . for f814w , f555w , f450w and f336w band , the flux increases by @xmath19 17% , 45% , 50% and 27% , respectively , without nebular subtraction .",
    "here , we adopt the nebular background subtracted flux with an uncertainty of @xmath20 , or @xmath21 mag .",
    "this uncertainty is much larger than the time variation of @xmath22  mag .",
    "thus , using the average flux of these non - simultaneous observations in data fitting is reasonable .",
    "the photometry results in units of erg  @xmath23  s@xmath4  @xmath4 are @xmath24 for f814w , @xmath25 for f555w , @xmath26 for f450w and @xmath27 for f336w .",

    ", an o5v companion star was excluded because such a star would produce high - ionization line fluxes in the nebula larger than observed @xcite .",

    "in contrast , based on optical spectroscopy of h  ii regions , @xcite found a low oxygen abundance , corresponding to a metallicity of @xmath50 for the galaxy , where @xmath51 is the solar abundance as estimated by @xcite . to be conservative , we considered both solar metallicity stellar models and low metallicity , @xmath52 , stellar models",
    ". referred to the metallicity , effective temperature , and surface gravity @xcite , model spectra were selected from the stellar atmospheres models of @xcite .",
    "the model spectra were normalized using the absolute magnitude of the corresponding stellar type from @xcite .",
    "since different distances have been reported for holmberg ii , e.g.  3.05  mpc in @xcite and 3.39  mpc in @xcite , distance was adopted as a free parameter , but fits were excluded if the distance obtained was unreasonable . the standard deviation on the absolute magnitude of galactic o supergiants given a spectral type is 0.45 mag @xcite . also , @xcite reported a scatter of 0.5 mag for ob stars .",
    "thus , a typical uncertainty of 0.5 mag on the normalization was adopted for various spectral types , which was translated into uncertainties of the inferred distances .",
    "we adopted the extinction @xmath53 as another free parameter . for solar metallicity models ,",
    "the reddening curves of @xcite were used in fitting .",
    "@xmath54 was assumed in the fitting .",

    "we thus tested the fits with @xmath56 varying from 3.1 to 6 , and the @xmath18 increases along with @xmath56 roughly , with @xmath57 ( 90% confidence level ) at @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , @xmath59 is preferred and adopted in the fitting . for low metallicity models , we fixed the galactic extinction to 0.032 @xcite , and then fit the extinction within holmberg ii adopting the reddening curve of @xcite .    the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and the residuals in units of @xmath60 are shown in figure  [ fig : uvo ] and figure  [ fig : uvol ] .",

    "x - rays are produced in a standard thin disk and in a comptonizing corona .",
    "the x - ray bright inner disk illuminates the outer disk and the compton component illuminates the whole disk outside a given radius .",

    "the electron temperatures of holmberg ii x-1 are between 2 and 3 kev .",
    "therefore , we fixed @xmath69 at 2 kev , keeping @xmath77 and @xmath88 , and then fitted the spectrum again .",
    "a good fit was obtained , with @xmath89 , and there is only one minimum for @xmath67 .",
    "the fitting results are : @xmath2 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 kev , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the main effect of the reduced electron temperature is that the disk normalization decreases by a factor of @xmath97 ; other parameters are not affected significantly .",
    "the results of fitting the uv and optical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to stellar models are summarized in table  [ tab : stellar ] .",
    "we first consider the continuum fits , excluding the region around the c  iv region ( 15001600  ) , listed in the rightmost column of table  [ tab : stellar ] .",
    "the solar metallicity stellar models produce poor fits .",
    "the o5v stellar model produced the best , yet still unacceptable , fit with @xmath98 , but fitted distance of @xmath99  mpc is unacceptable and @xcite find that such a star would over - produce the high - ionization lines observed from the nebula .",
    "the other solar metallicity stellar models produce very poor fits with @xmath100 .",
    "thus , all the solar metallicity stellar models are excluded .",
    "the low metallicity b - star models are also strongly excluded with @xmath100 . the low metallicity o5v model produced the best fit , but is , again , excluded by the results of @xcite .",
    "the low metallicity o5v model gives a marginally acceptable fit , @xmath101 corresponding to a chance probability of occurrence of @xmath102 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the stellar models produce at best marginally acceptable fits to the data .",
    "holmberg ii x-1 shows a relatively smooth uv spectrum .",
    "in contrast , the stellar models show obvious absorption lines between 1300   and 1600  , such as c  iv in o8 ib , c  iv and si  iv in b0 ib , c  iv , si  ii , si  iv and si  iii in b2 ib , si  iii in b5 ib , and c  iv in o5 v. the absence of these lines in the observed spectrum contributes to large @xmath61 when the full uv spectrum is included in the fits , see table  [ tab : stellar ] and figure  [ fig : uvo ] .",
    "this effect is strongest for the solar - metallicity models , but still significant for the low - metallicity models .",
    "however , these stellar uv lines are produced mainly in winds and may be suppressed in the presence of a luminous x - ray source .",
    "x - ray photoionization will either create an ionized strmgen hole around the x - ray source , the hatchett - mccray effect @xcite , or completely eliminate the radiatively - driven wind on the x - ray illuminated side of the companion @xcite .",
    "these effects have been observed in high mass x - ray binaries where the uv lines are generated in the wind with a p - cygni profile @xcite and should be amplified in ulxs where the ionization degree is orders of magnitudes higher .",
    "thus , stellar uv lines from ulx binaries should vary with orbital phase unless the binary is nearly face on .",
    "the lines should be absent when we view the x - ray illuminated side of the companion , and appear when we view the part of the stellar wind shadowed from x - rays @xcite .",
    "therefore , the absence of c  iv lines in a single observation of a ulx can not exclude a stellar origin of uv emission .",
    "conversely , if the companions in ulx binaries are high - mass stars , then repeated uv observations should reveal absorption lines and provide information about the binary period .",
    "in contrast to the stellar models , the irradiated disk model fits well to both uv and optical data with @xmath1 and matches the nebular extinction with a reddening of @xmath2 .",
    "these results suggest that the uv / optical flux of holmberg ii x-1 may be primarily due to emission from an x - ray irradiated disk .",
    "the best means to definitively determine the physical nature of the emission may be spectral observations around 2000   where the deviations between the stellar and disk models are strongest or monitoring observations to search for variability , particularly in the uv .",
    "we note that low mass x - ray binaries , where the uv / optical emission is thought to be dominated by disk irradiation , tend to show significant c  iv and other uv line emission due to photoionization ( e.g.  sco x-1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the uv lines in these sources are thought to be generated in a disk corona where the density is @xmath103@xmath104 @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "ulxs with x - ray luminosities near @xmath106  erg  s@xmath4 may have fully ionized the uv line emitting region , eliminating the uv line emission in a manner somewhat similar to the hatchett - mccray effect .",
    "photoionized he  ii @xmath107 line emission has been observed in several ulxs , such as holmberg ix x-1 , ngc 1313 x-2 , and ngc 5408 x-1 , with variable profiles and velocity dispersions up to @xmath108 km  s@xmath4 suggestive of a disk origin @xcite .",
    "other ulxs , like ngc 5204 x-1 , show neither he  ii nor c  iv emission @xcite . for holmberg ii x-1 ,",
    "the he  ii @xmath107 line is narrow ( @xmath109 km  s@xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is consistent with a nebular origin . he  ii emission is produced over a much broader range of ionization states than uv line emission @xcite , so a search for uv line emission from ulxs showing broad he  ii emission might provide information on the profile of x - ray illumination on the disk .    if the uv and optical emission from holmberg ii x-1 are , indeed , due to disk irradiation , then this would suggest that the x - ray emission is due to a standard thin accretion disk . in this case",
    ", the normalization of the thin disk emission is directly related to the size of the accretion disk and , therefore , the black hole mass .",
    "following @xcite , we calculate the disk inner radius @xmath110 as      where @xmath112 is a correction factor of 0.412 @xcite , @xmath113 @xcite is the ratio of the color temperature to the effective temperature , @xmath114 mpc is the distance , @xmath115 is the bolometric flux of the multicolor disk model and @xmath60 is the stefan- boltzmann constant . using the disk normalization found with the electron temperature fixed to 100  kev",
    ", we find @xmath116 cm which corresponds to a mass of @xmath117 for a non - rotating black hole .",
    "using the normalization found for an electron temperature of 2  kev lowers the estimates to @xmath118  cm and a black hole mass of @xmath119 .",
    "all mass estimates increase by a factor of 6 if an extreme kerr black hole is assumed",
    ".    the ratio of the outer versus inner disk radius inferred from the diskir model is @xmath120 .",
    "this is larger than the ratio found in some ulxs , such as ngc 6946 ulx-1 , ngc 1313 x-1 and ngc 5408 x-1 @xcite , but smaller than the ratio @xmath121 of some galactic sources @xcite . using the inner disk radius calculated above",
    ", the outer disk radius would then be @xmath122  cm .",
    "this is similar to the sizes estimated for the ulxs ngc 1313 x-1 and holmberg ix x-1 @xcite .",
    "the fraction of reprocessed radiation , @xmath123 , is larger than that of galactic x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "a larger @xmath73 indicates more flux is thermalized in the outer disk .",
    "this could be due to the fact that the disk temperature is lower , and thus produces softer x - rays which are more easily absorbed .",
