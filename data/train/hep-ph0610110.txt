    "with the conclusive evidence for a significant component of cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the universe , there is considerable interest , both at the theoretical and experimental level , to identify this cdm and analyse its properties . in particular ,",
    "if the cdm consists of a new weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , for example the lightest neutralino in supersymmetric models , the next generation of colliders has good prospects to discover it and determine its properties .",
    "if the parameters of the underlying model can be measured with sufficient precision , it may be possible to predict the annihilation cross sections hence the thermal relic density of the cdm candidate .",
    "the aim is to reach an accuracy comparable to the one from cosmological measurements to be able to perform consistency checks between a particular model of new physics and cosmology  @xcite .",
    "the recent data from wmap and sdss imply a value for the relic density of cold dark matter @xmath6",
    "@xcite at 2@xmath7 .",
    "range as of 2003 , @xmath8  @xcite and refer to this as the wmap range .",
    "note that the exact value and uncertainty of @xmath0 extracted from cosmological data depend on both the precise data sets used and the assumptions about other parameters  @xcite . ]",
    "most of the studies that have either analysed the constraints on the parameter space of the mssm arising from the relic density measurement , or that have analysed how to extract precise information on the model parameters at future colliders have assumed that cp is conserved .",
    "however cp - violating phases are generic in the mssm",
    ". furthermore cp violation may help to generate the correct baryon asymmetry in the universe in scenarios of electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "cp phases can have a strong impact on the relic density of neutralino dark matter , both due to modifications in the sparticle couplings and due to changes in the physical masses . here",
    "we highlight the impact of cp phases in a few typical scenarios for which the lsp is a ` good ' cdm candidate  @xcite . some of the largest effects are in fact due to kinematics .",
    "this should be expected as the relic density is often very sensitive to masses , in particular to the exact mass difference between the lsp and nlsp in coannihilation processes , or in the case of annihilation near a @xmath9-channel higgs resonance , to the difference between twice the lsp mass and the mass of the higgs . in these scenarios , setting apart the purely kinematic effects hence somewhat tames the huge effects due to phases found in some of the early studies  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there are other cases where the phase dependence of masses and couplings work against each other .",
    "taking out the kinematic effects actually enhances the phase dependence of the number density . since what are relevant to experiments are rather the physical observables ( masses , branching ratios , etc . ) than the underlying parameters , we take special care to disentangle effects arising from changes in the couplings from purely kinematic effects .",
    "in the mssm , the parameters that can have cp phases are the gaugino and higgsino mass parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the trilinear sfermion - higgs couplings , @xmath12 . for the relic density of the lsp",
    "the relevant phases are those of the neutralino sector ( only @xmath13 and @xmath14 since @xmath15 can be rotated away ) and the phase of the trilinear coupling @xmath16 which affects the higgs sector .",
    "the parameters that will be allowed to vary are those of the mssm defined at the weak scale @xmath17 where universality at the gut scale for the gaugino masses is assumed .",
    "@xmath18 is the common mass for third generation sfermion , the common mass for the sfermions of the first and second generation is set to @xmath19  tev and all trilinear couplings with the exception of @xmath16 are set to @xmath20  tev . the phase of the selectron coupling @xmath21 , although irrelevant for the relic density has to be taken into account since it contributes to electric dipole moments ( edms ) .",
    "allowing for cp - violating phases induces a mixing between the two cp - even states @xmath22 , @xmath23 and the cp - odd state @xmath24 of the mssm .",
    "the resulting mass eigenstates @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) are no longer eigenstates of cp , therefore it is preferable to use the charged higgs mass , @xmath27 , as an independent parameter .",
    "the lagrangian for the interaction of the lightest neutralino with higgs bosons which governs the neutralino annihilation cross section via higgs exchange , writes @xmath28 with the scalar and pseudoscalar couplings corresponding to the real and imaginary part of the same expression , see  @xcite . these couplings depend on the neutralino mixing , hence on phases in the neutralino sector , as well as on phases that enter the higgs mixing , for example @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , in the mssm , the higgs cp mixing is induced by loops involving top squarks and is proportional to @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "thus a large mixing is expected when @xmath31 is large as compared to the square of the stop masses .",
    "the results presented here have been obtained with the new implementation of the cpv - mssm within 2.0  @xcite . in this code , cp phases are taken into account consistently in all annihilation and coannihilation channels .",
    "the computation of masses , mixings and effective couplings in the higgs sector relies on cpsuperh  @xcite .",
    "standard   routines are used to calculate the relic density of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the cross sections for the annihilation and coannihilation processes will depend on phases , and so will the thermally - averaged cross section  @xcite",
    ". part of this is due to changes in the physical masses , leading to huge variations in the relic density especially when coannihilation processes are important or when annihilation occurs near a resonance .",
    "we will therefore take special care to disentangle the effects from kinematics and couplings .    at vanishing relative velocity",
    ", @xmath32 , neutralino annnihilation through @xmath9-channel scalar exchange is @xmath33-wave suppressed ; the annihilation proceeds strictly through pseudoscalar exchange .",
    "nevertheless when performing the thermal averaging , the scalar exchange can not be neglected altogether . in the mssm with real parameters",
    "it can amount to @xmath34 of the total contribution . in the presence of phases",
    ", all the neutral higgs bosons can acquire a pseudoscalar component ( that is @xmath35 ) and hence significantly contribute to neutralino annihilation even at small @xmath36 .",
    "there is a kind of sum rule that relates the couplings squared of the higgses to neutralinos .",
    "therefore , for the two heavy eigenstates which are in general close in mass , we do not expect a large effect on the resulting relic density from higgs mixing alone .",
    "a noteworthy exception occurs when , for kinematical reason , only one of the resonances is accessible to neutralino annihilation .",
    "that is for example the case when @xmath37 .",
    "we now turn to the numerical analysis and present results for two typical scenarios for which the relic density is in agreement with wmap : the mixed bino - higgsino lsp that annihilates into gauge bosons and the rapid annihilation through a higgs resonance , the so - called higgs funnel .",
    "more comprehensive results can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we always impose a constraint from the eedm , @xmath38  @xcite , including one- and two - loop contributions . when @xmath39 is not too large and sfermions of the first and second generations are heavy , this constraint usually forces @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , the free parameter @xmath21 is adjusted so that this constraint is satisfied .      when all scalars except the light higgs are heavy , @xmath41  tev , the most efficient annihilation of a pair of neutralinos with a mass of the order of 100  gev is through its higgsino component . in the real mssm",
    ", one needs a higgsino admixture of roughly 25%30% for the relic density to be within the wmap range @xcite . in terms of fundamental mssm parameters",
    "this means @xmath42 .",
    "figure  [ fig : m1mumh1000]a displays the allowed 2@xmath7 wmap band in the @xmath43 plane .",
    "the main annihilation mechanisms then are @xmath44 through @xmath45-channel chargino and neutralino exchange , as well as @xmath46 when kinematically allowed . the latter proceeds through @xmath9-channel @xmath47 or @xmath48 exchange .",

    "since the chargino mass is independent of @xmath13 , the nlsp  lsp mass splitting is reduced , making coannihilation processes with @xmath63 ( and also @xmath64 ) more important .",
    "second , the higgsino fraction decreases with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "this modifies the lsp couplings to gauge bosons and leads to a decrease in the dominant @xmath44 cross - sections and thus a higher value for the relic density .",
    "this phase dependence in the couplings is predominantly what determines the shift in the value of the relic density , to wit the almost perfect match between contours of constant @xmath0 and those of constant @xmath62 in fig .",
