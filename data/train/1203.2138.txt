    "originally just a prediction of general relativity , gravitational lensing has recently emerged as an independent means to make precision astrophysical and cosmological measurements , which are blind to the exact nature of the lens mass .",
    "this is particularly true for weak lensing due to large scale structure ( cosmic shear ) , which is able to map structure composed of both visible matter as well as dark matter , which is primarily detectable through its gravitational signal only .",
    "the importance of this new probe has spurred the development of a new generation of ground- and space - based surveys suited for precision weak lensing measurements .",
    "these ongoing , future , and proposed surveys ( e.g. cfhtls ( _ http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/science/cfhls/_ ) , des ( _ http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/_ ) , euclid ( _ http://sci.esa.int/euclid/_ ) , hsc ( _ http://www.naoj.org/projects/hsc/_ ) , hst ( _ http://www.stsci.edu/hst/_ ) , jwst ( _ http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/_ ) , lsst ( _ http://www.lsst.org/lsst/_ ) , pan - starrs    ( _ http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/_ ) , and wfirst ( _ http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/_ ) ) promise to provide greatly improved measurements of cosmic shear using the shapes of up to billions of galaxies .",
    "these cosmic measurements allow us to not only characterize the equation of state of dark energy , but when combined with other probes can improve constraints on the equation of state of dark energy and the matter fluctuation amplitude parameter by factors of 2 to 4 ( see for example @xcite and references therein . )",
    "weak lensing has also been shown to be very useful to test the nature of gravity at cosmological distance scales ( see for example the partial list @xcite . )",
    "the 3-point cosmic shear correlation and the shear bispectrum have been shown to break degeneracies in the cosmological parameters in addition to the constraints obtained from the 2-point cosmic shear correlation and the corresponding shear power spectrum that the power spectrum alone does not @xcite .",
    "for example , the results of @xcite showed that a deep lensing survey should be able to improve the constraints on the dark energy parameters and the matter fluctuation amplitude by a further factor of 2 - 3 using the bispectrum .",
    "most recently , @xcite derived parameter constraints by measuring the third order moment of the aperture mass measure using weak lensing data from the hst cosmos survey .",
    "they found independent results consistent with wmap7 best - fit cosmology and an improved constraint when combined with the 2-point correlation .",
    "in addition to improved parameter constraints , by definition the bispectrum also allows us to explore information about non - gaussianity in the universe that is inaccessible at the 2-point level , providing constraints on the degree of non - gaussianity ( see for example @xcite and references therein . )    .",
    "if the two galaxies are spatially close , at nearly the same redshift and angular position on the sky , they can be aligned by the tidal force field of the same nearby matter structure ( labeled dm in the figure ) .",
    "this is shown as the ii correlation .",
    "if instead a matter structure causes both the alignment of a nearby galaxy and contributes to the lensing signal of a background galaxy , this produces an anti - correlation with negative sign between the cosmic shear and intrinsic ellipticity , since the tidal force and gravitational lensing tend to align the galaxy shapes in orthogonal directions , and is shown as the gi correlation . ]",
    "as we describe below , we extend in this paper the 2-point self calibration technique proposed by @xcite to the 3-point intrinsic alignment auto - correlation bispectra between galaxies in a single redshift bin .",
    "this technique is different from the cross - correlation techniques proposed in @xcite and @xcite , instead using differences in the redshift dependencies of the intrinsic alignment and lensing bispectra to self - calibrate the intrinsic alignment signal .",
    "these 2-and 3-point intrinsic alignment correlations constitute a contaminant to the lensing signal and must be isolated and removed to avoid biasing the cosmological information contained within the cosmic shear power spectra and bispectra .",
    "cosmic shear measurements are in fact limited in precision by several systematic effects which must be accounted for in order to make full use of the potential of future weak lensing surveys ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) , and one of the serious systematic effects of weak lensing is this correlated intrinsic alignment of galaxy ellipticities , which act as a nuisance factor ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite showed that if intrinsic alignment is ignored , the determination of the dark energy equation of state is biased by as much as @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite found that the matter power spectrum amplitude can be affected by intrinsic alignment by up to @xmath3 , showing the importance of developing methods to isolate the intrinsic alignment and remove it from the cosmic shear signal .    .",
    "the iii correlation is between the intrinsic ellipticities of three spatially close galaxies which are intrinsically aligned by a nearby matter structure ( labeled dm in the figure ) .",
    "if instead two spatially close galaxies are intrinsically aligned by a nearby matter structure which contributes to the lensing of a third galaxy in the background , we label this the gii correlation .",
    "finally , the ggi correlation is where two galaxies are lensed by a structure which intrinsically aligns a third galaxy in the foreground . unlike the 2-point correlations , the sign of the ggi and gii correlations can depend both on triangle shape and scale . ]",
    "there are two 2-point intrinsic alignment correlations .",
    "the first is a correlation between the intrinsic ellipticity of two galaxies , known as the ii correlation .",
    "if the two galaxies are spatially close , they can be aligned by the tidal force field of the same nearby matter structure .",
    "the second intrinsic alignment correlation , known as the gi correlation , was identified by @xcite and is due to a matter structure both causing the alignment of a nearby galaxy and contributing to the lensing signal of a background galaxy .",
    "this produces an anti - correlation between the cosmic shear and intrinsic ellipticity , since the tidal force and gravitational lensing tend to align the galaxy shapes in orthogonal directions .",
    "we represent these correlations diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig:2ptia ] .",
    "the gi correlation has been measured in various subsets of the sdss spectroscopic and imaging samples by various groups .",
    "a detection of the large - scale gi correlation in the sdss was reported by @xcite , and then @xcite found an even stronger gi correlation for luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) .",
    "it was shown in these papers that this contamination can affect the lensing measurement and cosmology up to the @xmath4 level and up to @xmath3 in some cases for the matter fluctuation amplitude .",
    "this finding was confirmed by numerical simulations , where a level of contamination of @xmath4 was found @xcite .",
    "further measurements of the gi correlation were made in the sdss dataset by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite measured strong 2-point intrinsic alignment correlations in various sdss and megaz - lrg samples .    in a similar way , when we consider three galaxies and the related 3-point correlation , the cosmic shear signal ( ggg bispectrum ) also suffers from contamination by the 3-point intrinsic alignment correlations .",
    "the first is the iii correlation between intrinsic ellipticities of three spatially close galaxies which are intrinsically aligned by a nearby matter structure .",
    "the second is the gii correlation , where two spatially close galaxies are intrinsically aligned by a nearby matter structure which contributes to the lensing of a third galaxy in the background . finally , there is the ggi correlation , where two galaxies are lensed by a structure which intrinsically aligns a third galaxy in the foreground . unlike the 2-point correlations ,",
    "the sign of the ggi and gii correlations depend both on triangle shape and scale .",
    "the 3-point intrinsic alignment correlations are represented diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig:3ptia ] .",
    "@xcite showed that lensing bispectrum measurements are typically more strongly contaminated by intrinsic alignment compared to the lensing spectrum measurements , and that the contamination from the 3-point intrinsic alignment correlation can be as large as @xmath5 compared to the ggg lensing signal .",
    "the 3-point intrinsic alignment measurements are not only useful for constraining their contamination to 3-point lensing measurements , but are also useful for constraining models of intrinsic alignments and therefore constraining the contamination to all lensing measurements ( including 2-point correlations ) which will dominate the science cases of upcoming surveys .",
    "while the ii , iii , and gii intrinsic alignment correlations can be greatly reduced with photo - z s by using cross - spectra of galaxies in two different redshift bins ( see for example @xcite ) so that the galaxies are separated by large enough distances to assure that the tidal effect is weak , this does not work for the gi and ggi correlations which remain strong between galaxies at different redshifts and large separations .",
    "the gi correlation and methods for its removal have been the topic of several recent scientific publications and we review these briefly .",
    "initially , some first suggestions were discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite extended the approach of template fitting by @xcite to include a treatment of the gi correlation . @xcite and",
    "@xcite investigated the effects of the gi correlation on cosmological parameter constraints by assuming a model of the gi intrinsic alignment that is binned in redshift and angular frequency with some free parameters that are marginalized over .",
    "@xcite performed a cosmological constraint analysis where modeling of intrinsic alignment was included , showing a significant effect on the amplitude of matter fluctuations . using a geometrical approach , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , and @xcite proposed a nulling technique to remove the gi intrinsic alignment contribution by exploiting the redshift dependence of the correlations , but it was found that the technique throws out some of the valuable lensing signal .",
    "most recently , the nulling technique has been applied at the 3-point level for the ggi correlation , but again with similar signal loss to that at the 2-point level @xcite . finally , @xcite proposed a technique to self - calibrate the gi intrinsic alignment signal by using additional galaxy density ( cross-)correlations which are already present in weak lensing survey measurements .",
    "this approach was successfully extended in recent work by @xcite to the ggi cross - correlation bispectrum .",
    "@xcite applied an approach like the self - calibration , using correlations between lensing , intrinsic alignment , number density , and magnification effects to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "they found that the extra information from the additional correlations can make up for the additional free parameters in the intrinsic alignment so that the contamination can be removed without loss of constraining power .",
    "most recently , @xcite showed that redshift dependencies of the intrinsic alignment spectra can allow further improvements to the calculation of the intrinsic alignment contamination .",
    "@xcite demonstrates the strong redshift separation dependence of the 2-point gi and ii intrinsic alignment signals by considering the lensing and intrinsic alignment spectra due to galaxies in a single redshift bin that are at fixed photo - z separations @xmath6 relative to some mean redshift .",
    "this results in a relative change in magnitude of the gi and ii spectra of 50 - 60% , but only a few percent for gg at separation @xmath7 .",
    "this corresponds to a decrease in 10% of the total ellipticity power spectrum , which is identifiable in proposed surveys .",
    "parameterizing the intrinsic alignment spectra as proportional to various galaxy density ( cross-)spectra , this allows us to calculate and remove the intrinsic alignment component of the lensing signal .",
    "we propose in this work a method to extend this self - calibration technique to the 3-point statistics , using instead the redshift dependencies of the ggi , gii , and iii bispectra , in order to calculate and remove the intrinsic alignment contamination to the lensing bispectrum .",

    "[ fig : wabc ] , we see that to good approximation @xmath137 samples the same cosmic volume for different @xmath6 , which means that different @xmath6 should share the same cosmic variance as found for the power spectrum @xcite .",

    "it must be controlled in order to reach the necessary precision in order to identify the @xmath6 dependence at low levels of intrinsic alignment contamination .",
    "this is complicated by the fact that unlike cosmic variance , shot noise is uncorrelated at different @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite discusses a means to reduce the shot noise by averaging over larger @xmath18 bins at varying @xmath70 , since the @xmath6 dependence is weak across @xmath18 and @xmath142 for the power spectrum .",
    "we find this to be accurate for the bispectrum as well , and expect this method to be applicable in the 3-point self - calibration in order to reduce the shot noise to manageable levels in the small photo - z bins necessary for the self - calibration .",
    "we also anticipate the self - calibration to be applicable in the presence of other errors which have different @xmath6 dependencies .    in order for the self - calibration to reconstruct the intrinsic alignment signal in this way , with some associated error which is due primarily to the inaccuracy in eqs .",
    "[ eq : ggirel ] & [ eq : giirel ] , we must be able to measure 6 or more @xmath6 in @xmath1 photo - z bins which are distinct from the measurement error .",

    "[ fig : main ] , we would be able to achieve the necessary measurements to self - calibrate the intrinsic alignment signal for intrinsic alignment contaminations of @xmath143 or more for maximum @xmath7 . if we instead accept a greater inaccuracy in eqs .",
    "[ eq : ggirel ] & [ eq : giirel ] at higher @xmath6 , it would then be possible to measure smaller intrinsic alignment contaminations",
    ". the precise choice between maximum @xmath6 and error in the final intrinsic alignment measurement through the self - calibration will then be entirely dependent upon the specific capabilities of the survey as well as the goals of the measurement .",
    "for example , if the resulting intrinsic alignment bispectrum is intended to constrain models of structure formation or intrinsic alignment models , then a lower maximum @xmath6 might be imposed in order to achieve better accuracy in the intrinsic alignment measurement .",
    "the results of the previous section are dependent upon the accuracy of our assumptions in the quantitative calculations regarding the performance of the self - calibration . for the bispectrum , we have used an approximate fitting formula derived from perturbation theory by @xcite in our performance estimations , and we have chosen a specific set of intrinsic alignment models",
    ". we also use a deterministic approach to modeling the galaxy bias , which is not perfectly accurate in real galaxy distributions .",
    "failures in either these assumptions or the accuracy of the models for the intrinsic alignment bispectra would lead to additional uncertainty in the expected performance of the self - calibration , which may impact its applicability depending on the degree to which the assumptions or models fail . however , @xcite has shown that it is possible to suppress the galaxy stochasticity to the 1% level in some cases , which would be safely negligible compared to other sources of error we have discussed above .",
    "we have also chosen two very different models of the intrinsic alignment , in order to minimize bias in the resulting performance evaluation .",
    "the strong @xmath6 dependency of the intrinsic alignment signal for large bin size @xmath144 has been used to motivate the preference of cross - spectra and bispectra between redshift bins in order to reduce the intrinsic alignment contamination .",
    "this has previously been used as a means to neglect the iii and gii bispectra and ii spectrum in techniques developed to remove the intrinsic alignment contamination from the lensing signal using information between redshift bins @xcite . in this work",
    ", we instead use this @xmath6 dependency within a single redshift bin of size @xmath145 to self - calibrate the measured galaxy ellipticity - ellipticity - ellipticity bispectrum , reconstructing simultaneously not only the cosmic shear bispectrum ( ggg ) , but also the intrinsic alignment ggi , gii , and iii bispectra .",
    "we first explore several means of defining and measuring the @xmath6 dependence in the lensing and intrinsic alignment bispectra @xmath65 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath66 , and show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] the resulting @xmath6 dependency of the best method as well as the accuracy of the scaling relations in eqs .",
    "[ eq : gggiii]-[eq : ggirel ] .",
    "these relate the intrinsic alignment to the directly measurable galaxy density through a set of simple scaling parameters .",
    "this is true for both the toy model and the sb09 model of intrinsic alignment clustering , which have very different dependencies on both scale and redshift .",
    "we further show that unlike the intrinsic alignment bispectra , @xmath65 is effectively independent of @xmath6 , which means a measured @xmath6 dependence in the measured ellipticity bispectrum is a clear indication of the presence of intrinsic alignment .    using the measured cross - correlation galaxy ellipticity and galaxy density bispectra in a weak lensing survey , as well as the scaling relations in eqs .",
    "[ eq : gggiii]-[eq : ggirel ] , we propose a simple self - calibration method to simultaneously reconstruct the ggg , ggi , gii , and iii bispectra .",
    "the proposed self - calibration method relies only on the information already gathered by a weak lensing survey and makes no assumptions on the modeling of intrinsic alignment or photo - z pdf , instead depending on the relationship between the intrinsic alignment and galaxy density signals .",
    "we explore the feasibility and proposed structure of the self - calibration , including limitations on maximum @xmath6 due to the inaccuracy of eqs .",
    "[ eq : ggirel ] & [ eq : giirel ] , and discuss some means of addressing it .",
    "we find that @xmath146 is sufficient for accuracy in eq .",
    "[ eq : ggirel ] better than 20% .",
    "the precision of survey measurements of the lensing bispectrum also limits the applicability of the self - calibration , but we find that for the expected measurement error in lsst , we can reconstruct the intrinsic alignment signal for contaminations of 10% at @xmath7 , or for even smaller intrinsic alignment contaminations , but with less accuracy in the reconstructed intrinsic alignment signal .",
    "thus this would allow the self - calibration technique to significantly reduce the contamination of the intrinsic alignment to the weak lensing spectrum and bispectrum . however , further work is still necessary to precisely evaluate the quantitative performance of the self - calibration method in a realistic survey and its anticipated reduction in the effects of the intrinsic alignment contamination on cosmological study .",
    "the proposed self - calibration is complimentary to existing proposals for estimating the intrinsic alignment contamination to the bispectrum , which instead depend on information between redshift bins .",
    "it can be combined with these other methods which make use of redshift tomography to better constrain the intrinsic alignment contamination without over - using the information contained within the survey . by allowing the full reconstruction of the gii and iii bispectra in addition to the ggg and ggi bispectra ,",
    "while not relying on assumptions of an intrinsic alignment model , it also presents a means of indirectly measuring the intrinsic alignment signal , which will be applicable to constraining proposed intrinsic alignment models and our understanding of structure formation .",
