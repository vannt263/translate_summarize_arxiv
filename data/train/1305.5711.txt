    "the exotic hadrons , such as tetraquark states , hybrid states , and open - charm meson etc , are always hot topic in hadronic physics . in recent years",
    ", some new exotic hadrons , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3  @xcite , discovered in the experimental .",
    "their mass are closer to sum of two @xmath4 mesons  @xcite .",
    "these hadrons are probably molecular models in the tetraquark picture . in the molecular model of tetraquark states ,",
    "two mesons compose and formes a tetraquark by attractive residual strong interaction . except for molecular models ,",
    "tetraquark state has another configuration which is diquark - antidiquark model . in diquark - antidiquark model ,",
    "the diquark formed by two quarks is binding with antidiquark formed by two antiquarks .",
    "tetraquark states which are consists of the double heavy quarks and double light antiquarks as well as their charge conjugates can be very good candidates .",
    "they can be regarded as diquark - antidiquark model in the tetraqaurk picture . in these tetraquark states ,",
    "the two heavy quarks could tightly bounded and formed the color anti - triplet antisymmetric diquark cluster by strong attractive interaction .",
    "the size of the diquark is about @xmath5 @xcite and it can be considered as a point - like particle .",
    "it contributes the color interactions to double light antiquarks as a heavy antiquark .",
    "the two light anti - quarks are bounded with heavy diquark . as a result",
    ", the two heavy quarks and two light antiquarks can form a compact tetraquark state .",
    "the spin of a tatraquark state is composition of the spins of the four quarks and the relative orbital angular momenta between them . for @xmath6-waves ,",
    "the all orbital angular momenta vanish .",
    "when the two heavy quarks inside the diquark are identical , only spin one state for double heavy diquark is allowed because of the flavor anti - symmetric character . while , when the two heavy quarks in the double heavy diquark have different flavors , the spin of diquark may be one or zero .",
    "this discussion also can be adopt to the two light antiquarks sector . in this paper",
    ", we just consider the tetraquark states which are consists of two charm quarks and two light anti - quarks , with all orbital angular momenta vanished .",
    "we denote this tetraquark states by @xmath0 .",
    "flavor features of tetraquark with two heavy quarks and two light anti - quarks are very different from the conventional hadrons .",
    "if they are founded in experiments , we undoubtedly confirm the existence of the tetraquark states .",
    "the production of these tetraquark states have been studied in theoretically with different ways  @xcite . in paper",
    "@xcite , authors studied the production of double heavy tetraquark states at the large hadron collider(lhc ) and predicted possible decay channels of these tetraquark states .",
    "their results showed that there are very good opportunity to observe double heavy tetraquark states at the lhc .",
    "one of the motivation of this work is to investigate if there is any possibility to observe double heavy tetraquark states at the b - factories .",
    "the other one is that the hadronic background at the @xmath7 colliders is simpler than at the proton - proton collider .    in this paper , we calculate the total cross section of tetraquark states @xmath0 via virtual photon at the b - factories .",
    "we present the cross section at the leading order in @xmath8 in @xmath7 annihilation .",
    "the process can be factorized into three subprocess .",
    "the first subprocess is that the @xmath9 , which is a hard process at the distance scale @xmath10 and it can be calculated by perturbative qcd(pqcd ) . for the second subprocess , formation of qiduark from two heavy quarks ,",
    "the relative momentum between two heavy quarks is small with @xmath11 .",
    "such subprocess should be calculated by non - perturbation methods . at the subprocess",
    ", the tetraquark will be produced via the diquark picking up two light antiquarks from the vacuum at distance scale @xmath12 and it is also a non - perturbative process which can be described by fragmentation model .",
    "in the b - factory , the tetraquark particles production via a virtual photon @xmath13 as shown in fig.[cfour ] . as discussed above , in the production process of the tetraquark states @xmath0 , these distance scales satisfy the hierarchy relation @xmath14 .",
    "different physical processes happening at those distinct energy scales are factorized .",
    "they can be calculated by pqcd , nrqcd , and the fragmentation function respectively .",
    "therefore , total cross section can described as    @xmath15    where@xmath16 is the average spin of initial particle ; @xmath17 is from permutation symmetry between identical final particles ; @xmath6 is center of mass energy of initial electron and positron and the masses of electron and positron are ignored ; @xmath18 is the short distance coefficient describing the production rate of the color anti - triplet point - like @xmath19 state at the energy scale @xmath20 or higher ; @xmath21 is the wave function at the origin of the @xmath6-wave diquark state ; @xmath22 is the fragmentation function of the diquark into color - singlet tetraquark state @xmath0 and @xmath23 is the normalization factor in the fragmentation function ; @xmath24 is the lorentz invariant three - body phase space integral element , which is @xmath25    . ]",
    "the short distance coefficient is calculated by perturbative qcd and can be expanded as a powers of @xmath8 at energy scale m or higher . for the formation of diquark from two heavy quarks , where the motion between two heavy quarks is very slow at distance @xmath26 ,",
    "it is calculated by the potential model .",
    "the tetraquark state will be produced by diquark picking up two antiquarks from the vacuum at distance scale @xmath27 .",
    "it is also a non - perturbative process which can be calculated by fragmentation function .",
    "the short distance coefficient @xmath28 is proportional to squared matrix element @xmath29 at the tree level , where @xmath19 is design to be color anti - triplet and spin one point - like state , which is composed by two charm quarks .",
    "the dependence of scattering amplitude including clebsh - gorden coefficients are written in terms of fermion string as ref.@xcite .",
    "for convenience of calculation , the wave function of the diquark was described as projection operator in non - relativistic approximation . correspondingly , we reorganized the amplitude of subprocess @xmath30 .",
    "there are eight feynman diagrams with four different topological structures , since we just need to calculate four amplitudes .",
    "they are    @xmath31    then @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are electric charge of charm quarks and initial particles in the unit @xmath34 ; @xmath35 is color factor , @xmath36 is the anti - symmetry tensor ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 are strong coupling constant and electromagnetic constant ; @xmath39 is initial leptonic part which includes photon propagator factor ; @xmath40 is mass of charm quark ; @xmath41 is four momentum of point - like state @xmath19 ; @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 are four momentum and spin of anti charm quarks ; @xmath46 is projection operator of color anti triplet and spin one point - like state of two charm quarks . in principle",
    ", the projection wave function for binding of @xmath19 should written as @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are spinor of two charm quarks inside the point - like state @xmath19 ; @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 are four momentum and spin of these charm quarks , respectively ; @xmath54 is clebsh - gorden coefficient of the coupling of two charm quarks @xmath19 .",
    "if we represent one of the quarks by the charge conjugate field , the constructions look more familiar : @xmath55 , where @xmath56 . in the paper @xcite ,",
    "the authors transform the fermion line @xmath57 of the diquark - production case to anti - fermion line of the meson - production @xmath58 by using characters of charge conjugation operator . , i.e @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "see ref.@xcitefor further discussion .",
    "] similarly    @xmath62    given four momentum of the diquark @xmath41 , the relative four momentum between two charm quarks @xmath63 , the four momentum of two charm quarks @xmath50 , @xmath51 can be expressed as    @xmath64 here @xmath65 is mass of diquark . in the heavy quark limit ,",
    "@xmath66 , @xmath41 and @xmath63 are orthogonal : @xmath67 . in the rest frame of the diquark ,    @xmath68    in the rest frame of the diquark",
    ", the amplitude is expanded in powers of relative velocity @xmath69 between two charm quarks . in this paper , we only consider the leading order contribution of @xmath70 , since the dependence of short distance coefficients to the relative momentum @xmath63 can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the four momentum of charm quarks can be @xmath71 .",
    "the projection operator for the coupling of two charm quarks , under the non - relativistic approximation , takes the simple form  @xcite :    [ spin - pro-2 ] @xmath72    where @xmath73 is polarization vector for spin - triplet state .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath46 are projection operator for spin 0 and spin 1 state respectively .      according to the discussion in ref.@xcite , two charm quarks bind to form a stable color - anti - triplet diquark . in the heavy quark limit ,",
    "the distance between two charm quarks is much smaller than @xmath75 , since the @xmath76 is determined by coulomb potential  @xcite .",
    "it can be predicted by solving shrdinger equation with coulomb potential , @xmath77 . for anti - triplet @xmath19 diquark state ,",
    "its numerical value is @xmath78 . and",
    "the production amplitude of diquark via @xmath7 annihilation expressed as    @xmath79    where @xmath18 includes tree level amplitude of subprocess @xmath80 and normalization factor in diquark wave function .      as discussed above , in the heavy quark limit",
    ", the heavy diquark cluster takes a point - like anti - quark color structure . in principle , at the low energy scale , quark can omit arbitrary number soft - gluons and these gluons can bound heavy diquark with another two light anti - quarks which picked up from the vacuum .",
    "we can simulate this subprocess @xmath81 by fragmentation mode of the heavy quark .",
    "because the symmetry between the heavy quarks obtain two light quarks from vacuum by fragmentation process to antiquark fragmentation , we use the fragmentation mode of diquark with the one of the two heavy quarks .    the fragmentation model to produce the tetraquark are",
    "nonperturbative(scale is @xmath75 ) . in this paper",
    ", we choose one of the most commonly used fragmentation function , the @xmath82 function model  @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation function is    @xmath83    where @xmath23 is the normalization constant .",
    "the normalization constant can be fitted using the constraint condition . @xmath84",
    "the fragmentation probability of charm quark fragmentation into baryon is @xmath85=0.094\\pm 0.035 $ ] which is measured by the @xmath7 colliders  @xcite .",
    "thus , we approximately take the fragmentation probablity of double heavy diquark fragmentation into tetraquark with double charm quarks and two light antiquarks as @xmath86 .",
    "in this work , we studied production of the tetraquark states at the b - factories . and we predicted the production cross section of the process @xmath87 at the leading order of @xmath8 expansion at the kekb . in order to obtain numerical result , we choose the parameters of the fine structure constant and strong coupling constant as @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and mass of charm quarks and double charm diquark are @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and the center mass energy is @xmath92 at the kekb .",
    "@xmath93 result shows that it is difficult to search tetraquark states at the normal @xmath7 colliders .",
    "but there may be some hope to observe the tetraquark states at the high facility b - factories , like super - b at the kek - b , it s luminosity will be promoted to @xmath94 , and it implies that around @xmath95 events can be produced at this collider one year .",
    "although there may be difficulties for the discovery of these tetraquark states in this collider , once the detection efficiency is considered .",
