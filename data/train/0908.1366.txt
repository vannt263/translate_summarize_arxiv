    "a collection of a finite or infinite number of points in @xmath4-dimensional euclidean space @xmath5 is called a _ point configuration_. point configurations are one of the most popular and widely used models for many - particle systems in various branches of modern science , including condensed matter physics and materials science @xcite , statistical mechanics @xcite , discrete mathematics ( packing problems ) @xcite , astrophysics ( distribution of galaxy clusters ) @xcite , ecology ( tree distributions in forests ) @xcite and biology ( various cellular structures ) @xcite .",
    "point configurations can exhibit a variety of degrees of disorder , from the most random poisson distribution @xcite to a perfectly ordered bravais lattice @xcite .",
    "the degrees of disorder can be quantified by discriminating order metrics @xcite , which , in their simplest forms , are scalars and normalized such that the most disordered system is associated with zero and the most ordered ones with unity .    in most circumstance ,",
    "it is impossible and even unnecessary to acquire detailed knowledge of all positions of the points in the configuration . instead",
    ", statistical descriptors such as distribution functions are typically employed to characterize the point configurations . in particular , the @xmath0-body distribution function @xmath6 is related to the probability of finding a generic configuration of @xmath0 points at positions @xmath7 .",
    "it is well known that a set of @xmath0-body distribution functions @xmath8 @xcite is required to statistically characterize an @xmath0-point configuration completely . as @xmath9 in the thermodynamic limit ( e.g.",
    ", the volume @xmath10 which the @xmath0 points occupy also increases to infinity such that the number of points per volume  number density @xmath11  is a well defined finite number ) , the set contains an infinite number of correlation functions . for statistically homogeneous systems which is the focus of this paper",
    ", @xmath1 is translationally invariant and hence depends only on the relative displacements of the positions with respect to some chosen origin , say @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the one - body distribution function @xmath15 is just equal to the number density @xmath16 .",
    "the important two - body quantity @xmath17 is usually referred to as the pair distribution function . in the statistically isotropic case , @xmath2 is a radial function , i.e. , @xmath18 and it is also called the radial distribution function .",
    "the radial distribution function which is one of the most widely used structural descriptors , essentially provides the distribution of the point - pair separation distances and can be obtained experimentally via scattering of radiation @xcite .",
    "the three - body function @xmath19 contains information about how the pair separations involved in @xmath2 are linked into triangles .",
    "it is worth noting that by decorating the points in the system ( e.g. , letting equal - sized spheres be centered at each point ) , one can construct a two - phase random texture from a given point configuration .",
    "in general , there is an infinite number of ways to decorate a point configuration . in the characterization of random textures ,",
    "the analog of the @xmath0-body distribution functions are the @xmath0-point correlation functions @xmath20 @xcite , which gives the probability of finding @xmath0 points at positions @xmath7 in the phase of interest . in general , a complete statistical characterization of a continuum random texture requires an infinite set of @xmath21 .",
    "though under certain conditions , @xmath1 of a point configuration and @xmath21 of the associated decorated random texture might convey the same level of structural information ( in fact the associated @xmath21 can expressed as functional of @xmath1 given the details of the decorating phase @xcite ) , the former evidently reflect the essential geometrical features of the point configuration more directly .",
    "an intriguing inverse problem that has been receiving considerable attention is the reconstruction ( or construction ) of realizations of a many - body system ( essentially a point configuration ) that match the prescribed structural information of the system in the form of @xmath2 or @xmath22 , obtained from either experiments or theoretical considerations .",
    "examples include the reconstruction of random media @xcite and colloidal suspensions @xcite , investigation of the iso-@xmath2 process @xcite or @xmath2-invariant processes and the realizability conditions of @xmath2 @xcite as well as the more recent discovery of unusual disordered classical ground states @xcite .",
    "x - ray scattering techniques have been an indispensable tool historically in the study of the structures of crystalline matter , and it has been generalized to probing disordered media @xcite . in particular , the pair distribution function @xmath23 is obtainable from the fourier transform of the structure factor @xmath24 @xcite , which is proportional to the scattering intensity ( with the atomic structure function removed ) and can be directly measured in experiments . with the obtained @xmath2 , one",
    "can then employ various reconstruction techniques to generate realizations of the system of interest .",
    "another related family of inverse problems is the reconstruction of pair interaction potential from a given radial distribution function @xmath25 between particles , i.e. , the inverse monte carlo problems @xcite .",
    "it is known that though the information contained in @xmath2 can be sufficient to completely characterize ordered point configurations in very special circumstances @xcite it is generally devoid of crucial structural information to uniquely determine a disordered point configuration @xcite .",
    "however , it seems that this aspect has not been widely appreciated and general claims of uniqueness of the reconstructions using @xmath2 or @xmath22 have been made based on numerical studies @xcite .",
    "one aim of this paper is to show via a variety of examples the existence of distinct point configurations with identical pair - distance distributions ( e.g. , @xmath2 ) , which implies the non - uniqueness of the reconstructions involving @xmath2 of these point configurations . besides",
    ", general mathematical formalism to characterize the structural ambiguity of pair information is also devised .",
    "@xmath26{fig1a.eps } & \\includegraphics[width=5.5cm , keepaspectratio]{fig1b.eps } \\\\ \\mbox{\\bf ( a ) } & \\mbox{\\bf ( b ) } \\end{array}$ ]    figure [ kite - trape ] shows two distinct configurations of four points in two dimensions with identical pair distances .",
    "in particular , one configuration ( with the pair distances shown ) resembles a `` kite '' and the other resembles a `` trapezoid '' . in order to provide an in - depth presentation of the ambiguity of pair - distance distributions ,",
    "it is necessary to exam the problem mathematically first and then discuss the physical implications .",
    "some definitions are in order here . two @xmath4-dimensional statistically homogeneous and isotropic @xmath0-point configurations @xmath27 and @xmath28 are identical if and only if they possess identical sets of @xmath29-body distribution functions @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "the configurations @xmath27 and @xmath28 are @xmath30-distinct if and only if they process distinct @xmath0-body distribution functions for all @xmath32 .",
    "a @xmath4-dimensional @xmath0-point configuration @xmath33 is @xmath29-fold degenerate if and only if there exist additional @xmath34 @xmath4-dimensional @xmath0-point configurations @xmath27 ( @xmath35 ) that are mutually @xmath19-distinct and also @xmath19-distinct from @xmath33 , all of which possess the same two - body distribution function @xmath2 .",
    "this definition of structural degeneracy rules out the possibility that two degenerate point configurations are trivially connected by translation , rotation , mirror reflection or any of their combinations .",
    "moreover , we consider that two point configurations are equivalent ( i.e. , do not form a degenerate pair ) if they are related by a trivial isotropic rescaling , which does not change the internal structure of the configuration .",
    "thus , we see that the `` kite '' and the `` trapezoid '' are associated with the same set of pair distances ( i.e. , they are two - fold degenerate ) , but the triangle information of the two is distinguishable @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting the historically prominent kirkwood superposition approximation of @xmath19 which replaces the three - body distribution function with a product of three pair distribution functions @xcite . because the separate members of our pair - distance degeneracy examples present distinct triangle ( i.e. three - body ) distributions , the conclusion must be that no functional of @xmath2 ( kirkwood or otherwise ) can uniquely specify @xmath19 .    it is clear that given @xmath2 associated with the degenerate point configurations , it is impossible even in principle to obtain a unique reconstruction , and each degenerate configuration should be recovered with equal probability .",
    "therefore , an outstanding problem is to determine under what conditions the pair distance information contained in @xmath2 could uniquely determine a point configuration , i.e. , there is no associated structural degeneracy .",
    "a question with more practical importance is that how the point configurations would change when the measurement of @xmath2 is subject to slight imprecision , a common situation in experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "@xmath36{fig2.eps } \\end{array}$ ]    in addition to their physical relevance , degenerate point configurations are also of mathematical interest .",
    "for example , open questions connected to the famous traveling salesman problem @xcite can be raised : given the degenerate configurations associated with the same set of pair distances , what are the optimal solutions of the traveling salesman problem for each configuration and are they unique ?",
    "are there special degenerate configurations whose solutions are identical ?",
    "for the simplest `` kite - trapezoid '' example shown in fig .",
    "[ kite - trape ] , for the parameter values @xmath37 the `` trapezoid '' has three distinguishable circuits and the `` kite '' has only two ( see fig .",
    "[ tsp_fig ] ) . the shortest route among all is presented by the `` trapezoid '' , i.e. , a closed circuit visiting each vertex once and only once . for @xmath38 , both the `` kite '' and the `` trapezoid '' collapse onto a line segment , and in that limiting case all circuits have the same length . for more general and complicated degenerate configurations ,",
    "such questions are notoriously difficult to solve ; the problem belongs to the np - complete class .",
    "@xmath39{fig3a.eps } & \\includegraphics[width=4.75cm , keepaspectratio]{fig3b.eps } \\\\ \\mbox{\\bf ( a ) } & \\mbox{\\bf ( b ) } \\end{array}$ ]    in this paper , we introduce the idea of the distance space ( i.e. , the @xmath3 space ) , in which each dimension is associated with the separation distance between a given point - pair . the pair - distance distribution of a particular point configuration is then presented by a single point in the @xmath3 space .",
    "it is clear that not all the points in @xmath3 space correspond to realizable configurations , i.e. , the separation distances have to satisfy certain conditions such that they could be assembled into a point configuration .",
    "these conditions together define a ( partially ) bounded region in the @xmath3 space .",
    "for example , for three - point configurations in @xmath40 ( i.e. , triangles ) , the region of the feasible distances is an open `` pyramid '' in the three - dimensional @xmath3 space , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 2dp3-dspace ] .",
    "when degeneracy exists the region of the feasible distances is generally a complicated closed intersection of several such simple curved `` pyramid '' in high dimensions .",
    "the determination of the region of feasible distances is equivalent to obtaining the conditions of a realizable @xmath2 , i.e. , a pair distribution function that can be associated with a point configuration . using the @xmath3 space",
    ", we will answer various aspects of the aforementioned questions concerning the degenerate point configurations and the non - uniqueness issue of the reconstruction .",
    "we will show that the utility of the @xmath3 space also improves our understanding of various important problems in statistical physics such as the recently proposed decorrelation principle in high - dimensional euclidean space @xcite . in a sequel to this paper",
    ", we will extend the present analysis to understand degeneracy issues pertaining to heterogeneous materials , which is a larger classification than point configurations @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the @xmath3 space in detail and derive the conditions for feasible distances and for the occurrence of degeneracy , through which we show that in general degeneracy is rare . in sec .",
    "iii , we provide a variety of examples of degenerate point configurations and illustrate how the conditions derived in sec .",
    "ii could be employed to construct point configurations with specific degeneracy . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss several problems in statistical physics such as the reconstruction of atomic structures from experimentally obtained @xmath2 and the decorrelation principle , based on the idea of the @xmath3 space .",
    "finally , we make concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we will discuss in details the @xmath3 space .",
    "in particular , we will derive the conditions under which the pair distances could be assembled into a point configuration , i.e. , the feasibility conditions as well as the conditions under which the pair distances correspond to degenerate point configurations .",
    "we will first study a four - point configuration in @xmath40 to illustrate the idea and then consider the general @xmath0-point configurations in @xmath5 .",
    "consider a four - point configuration @xmath41 in @xmath40 ( see fig .",
    "[ 2d4p ] ) and the associated 6-dimensional @xmath3 space .",
    "we would like to know the answers to the following two questions :    \\(i ) _ what are the conditions the six pair separation distances must satisfy so that they correspond to a four - point configuration in @xmath40 ? _",
    "\\(ii ) _ what are the conditions the pair distances must satisfy so that they correspond to @xmath29-fold degenerate four - point configurations in @xmath40 ? _",
    "@xmath42{fig4.eps } \\end{array}$ ]    to answer these questions , we consider a particular construction as follows : suppose the six pair distances are elements of the set @xmath43 , which can be further partitioned as @xmath44 where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is the null set ) , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we will see that such a partition enables us to associate the pair distances with the corresponding points in a convenient way .",
    "recall that from our definition ( sec .",
    "i ) , point configurations are considered identical if they are connected by translation , rotation , mirror reflection and any of their combinations .",
    "thus , we can put point @xmath50 at the origin of a cartesian coordinate system and put point @xmath51 on one of the two orthogonal axes of the coordinate system separated from the origin ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) by a distance @xmath52 .",
    "note different choices of the position of @xmath50 and the orientation of the line segment @xmath53 lead to point configurations that are identical up to translations and rotations . for point @xmath54 , we can either let @xmath55 , @xmath56 or @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "the two choices correspond to two configurations connected by a mirror reflection , which are considered identical and either choice is acceptable . with out loss of generality ,",
    "we choose @xmath55 , @xmath56 . finally , we choose @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 for point @xmath62 .",
    "we see from the above construction that the positions of points @xmath54 and @xmath62 are determined with respect to the line segment defined by points @xmath50 and @xmath51 as a `` reference '' structure .",
    "note that the line segment is a one - dimensional simplex . in @xmath40 , the position of a point",
    "is completely determined by specifying two distances from the point of interest to the vertices of a reference line segment , given that the distances involved satisfy the triangular inequality , i.e. , the triangle formed by the point of interest and the two vertices of the reference line segment possess non - negative area .",
    "the area @xmath63 of a triangle with edges @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 is related to the cayley - menger determinant @xcite , i.e. ,    @xmath67    thus , for point @xmath54 , we obtain    @xmath68    and for point @xmath62 , we obtain    @xmath69    inequalities ( [ eq02 ] ) and ( [ eq03 ] ) define a partially bounded region in the six - dimensional @xmath3 space , the lower - dimensional analog of which is the open pyramid shown in fig .",
    "[ 2dp3-dspace ] .",
    "the distance @xmath70 between points @xmath54 and @xmath62 is also completely determined by @xmath71 via    @xmath72    which results from the requirement that all the @xmath73 minors of the gram matrix @xcite involving the distances possess zero determinant .",
    "we will discuss the gram matrix in detail in sec .",
    "equation([eq05 ] ) defines a curved hypersurface in the @xmath3 space , whose intersection with the region defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq02 ] ) and ( [ eq03 ] ) contains the feasible distances @xmath74 that can be assembled into a four - point configuration in @xmath40 .",
    "we call eqs .",
    "( [ eq02 ] ) , ( [ eq03 ] ) and ( [ eq05 ] ) the _ feasibility _ conditions .",
    "note that for the four - point configuration in @xmath40 , only five pair distances can be chosen almost independently subject to the mild triangle inequality constraint .",
    "thus we define the _ free dimension _ of the @xmath3 space to be the number of pair distances that are only constrained by inequalities , which total to five here .",
    "the free dimension is also the dimension of the region for the feasible distances , which is also referred to as the _ feasible region_.    now we can answer question ( i ) given at the beginning of this section easily . suppose a list of distances is given , when any one permutation of these distances satisfies the feasibility conditions [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq02]),([eq03 ] ) and ( [ eq05 ] ) ] , the pair distances correspond to a four - point configuration in @xmath40 .",
    "however , such a simple answer does not exist for ( ii ) .",
    "for the pair distances to correspond to @xmath29-fold degenerate point configurations , a necessary condition is that the dimension of the intersection of the feasible regions for the @xmath29 permutations of the pair distances is non - zero . in other words ,",
    "each permutation of the pair distances is associated with a set of feasibility conditions , and a feasible region can be constructed . to obtain a @xmath29-fold degeneracy ,",
    "all sets of the feasibility conditions need to be satisfied simultaneously , which is only possible when the intersection of the feasible regions is at least a single curve in the @xmath3 space .",
    "for the two - dimensional four - point configuration of interest the free dimension is five , which leads to an upper bound on the order of the degeneracy , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "this condition is only a necessary one because there are certain permutations that lead to identical configurations , such as those that correspond to the permutations among the point indices which do not change the structure of the configuration , since the points are indistinguishable .",
    "for example , @xmath76 and @xmath77 correspond to an exchange of @xmath54 and @xmath62 , which possess the identical feasible regions and thus do not contribute the the degeneracy .",

    "iii we will construct concrete examples of degenerate @xmath41 , where the details of permutations are considered .      the generalization of the above formulation is straightforward .",
    "note in the following discussion in this section , we assume @xmath78 ; the case when @xmath79 ( i.e. , the simplex configurations ) are discussed in detail in sec .",
    "iii.a and the case when @xmath80 is trivial .",
    "consider an @xmath0-point configuration @xmath81 in @xmath5 , which possesses @xmath82 pair distances @xmath83 .",

    ". in particular , denote the @xmath93 vertices of the @xmath4-dimensional simplex by @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) , we can define a @xmath96 distance matrix @xmath97 , i.e. ,    @xmath98    where @xmath99 denotes the @xmath100-norm of a @xmath4-dimensional vector and @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) is the squared distance between vertex @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the volume @xmath63 of the simplex is then given by the cayley - menger determinant , i.e. ,    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is a @xmath107 matrix obtained from @xmath97 by bordering @xmath97 with a top row @xmath108 and a left column @xmath109 .",
    "for example , eq .  ( [ eq07 ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ eq01 ] ) in @xmath40 , and in @xmath110 we obtain    @xmath111    the requirement that the constructed @xmath4-dimensional simplex possesses non - negative volume leads to higher dimensional analogs of the well known triangle inequalities in two dimensions , which we will refer to as _ simplex inequalities_. in general , each set of the simplex inequalities associated with a point @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) defines a partially bounded region in the @xmath3 space , the intersection of which is a high - dimensional analog of the open pyramid shown in fig .  [ 2dp3-dspace](b ) .",
    "it is clear from the above construction that a point configuration @xmath81 can be completely determined by only specifying @xmath112 $ ] distances ( e.g. , `` free '' distances ) , satisfying the simplex inequalities .",
    "thus , the free dimension of the @xmath3 space is @xmath113 and the remaining @xmath114 pair distances ( e.g. , `` constrained '' distances ) can not be chosen freely but instead are completely determined by the @xmath113 `` free '' distances . to obtain the relations between",
    "the `` constrained '' and `` free '' distances , we will employ the following theorem @xcite :    theorem 1 : _ for a set of @xmath0 vectors @xmath115 in @xmath5 ( @xmath116 ) , let the gram matrix be defined by @xmath117 where @xmath118 denotes the inner product .",
    "then all @xmath96 minors of @xmath119 must have zero determinant .",
    "_    the proof of the theorem is given in ref .",
    "it is essentially another way of stating the fact that there are at most @xmath4 linearly independent vectors among @xmath115 in a @xmath4-dimensional euclidean space . without loss of generality",
    ", we can choose the origin at @xmath120 and obtain @xmath121    consider the identity @xcite , @xmath122,\\ ] ]    we obtain that @xmath123    where @xmath124 is the distance between the two points @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "thus we see the requirement that all @xmath96 minors of @xmath125 have zero determinant ( denoted by @xmath126 ) , i.e. , latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq12 }     leads to fourth order algebraic equations involving the @xmath114 `` constrained '' distances .",
    "it is clear that each `` constrained '' distance can be explicitly expressed as a function of the `` free '' distances alone . for four - point configuration in @xmath40 ,",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) gives eq .",
    "( [ eq05 ] ) .",
    "note these equalities define curved hypersurfaces in the @xmath3 space .",
    "the intersection of these curved hypersurfaces as well as the partially bounded regions defined by ( [ eq07 ] ) gives the feasible region of the @xmath3 space , i.e. , when any permutation of the @xmath128 pair distances lies within the feasible region , these distances can be assembled into an @xmath0-point configuration in @xmath5 .      for the distances @xmath74 to correspond to @xmath29-fold degenerate point configurations @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath85 , @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) , the feasibility conditions for @xmath29 distinct permutations of @xmath74 should be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "the feasibility conditions associated with any particular permutation of @xmath74 include a set of equalities , which would reduce the dimension of the feasible region in the @xmath3 space .",
    "suppose that for each distinct permutation only one additional equality constraint is introduced .",
    "then we can obtain an upper bound on the order of the degeneracy , i.e. , @xmath133 , which corresponds to a feasible region that has been reduced to a single curve ( with one free dimension ) .",
    "that is , only one distance can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "however , different choices of the single free distance correspond to trivial isotropic rescaling of the entire configuration , which leads to no degeneracy based on our definition .",
    "note that if the permutation does not introduce new feasibility conditions , it corresponds to a permutation of the point indices , which does not affect the structure of the configuration .",
    "the properties of the feasible regions have important implications .",
    "as we have seen , the structural degeneracy would reduce the dimension of the feasible regions , the volume of which is proportional to the number of feasible distance sets . for a particular @xmath0-point configuration , we could in principle",
    "identify all feasible distance sets by exploring the whole feasible region in the @xmath3 space point by point .",
    "however , the distance sets associated with degeneracies can only lie on a hypersurface with lower dimensions than the feasible region .",
    "the volume ratio of the hypersurface to the feasible region , which is also the number ratio of the distance sets associated with degeneracies to those without degeneracies , is vanishingly small . in other words , although degeneracies exist they are extremely rare .",
    "this might explain why perfect reconstructions ( identical match of the pair distances and the configurations up to translations , rotations and mirror reflections ) can be obtained numerically @xcite .",
    "however , the general conclusion that pair statistics alone would uniquely determine the configurations could not be made only based on those numerical results , as we will show in the next section via a variety of examples of degeneracy .",
    "in this section , we construct a variety of degenerate point configurations using the general scheme developed in sec .",
    "ii . in particular",
    ", we study the degeneracies of simplices in @xmath5 , four - point configurations in @xmath40 and specific @xmath0-point configurations in @xmath5 possessing two - fold degeneracy .",
    "a simplex in @xmath5 is the convex hull of a set of @xmath93 points @xmath134 that do not all lie on the same @xmath89-dimensional hyperplane .",
    "a simplex in @xmath40 is a triangle and in @xmath110 is a tetrahedron .",
    "simplices in @xmath5 ( @xmath135 ) can be considered to be @xmath4-dimensional generalizations of the three - dimensional tetrahedron .",

    "is not reduced due to degeneracy .",
    "thus , one should expect that it is much easier to obtain highly degenerate simplices than other point configurations .",
    "suppose we have a distance set @xmath83 ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "it is clear that if we choose @xmath137 , where @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) are mutually distinct small numbers .",
    "they will satisfy all the simplex inequalities and correspond to a point in the vicinity of the centroid of the feasible region .",
    "the maximum magnitude of the @xmath140 s depends on the boundaries of the feasible region , which we need not to worry about for the moment , as long as the @xmath140 s are sufficiently small and mutually distinct .    in @xmath40 ( @xmath141 ) ,",
    "the three distances can be assembled into a unique triangle , i.e. , we have @xmath142 .",
    "this can also be seen from the following argument : since configurations connected by translations and rotations are considered identical , we could pick any one of the three distances along one of the coordinate axes starting from the origin and require the same for the corresponding distance of all possible degenerate configurations . in this way",
    ", we rule out translations and rotations in a plane .",
    "there are only two distances left , which can be assembled into a triangle in two ways",
    ". however , the two resulting triangles are mirror image of each other .",
    "thus , we have @xmath143 , where `` !",
    "'' indicates factorial .    in @xmath110 ( @xmath144 ) , we similarly choose one of the six distances as the `` reference '' distance , and the remaining five are assigned to different edges of a tetrahedron , which results in @xmath145 tetrahedra .",
    "however , among these tetrahedra there are pairs that are connected by mirror reflection which has to be excluded .",
    "two mirror reflection plane can be identified : one perpendicular to the reference distance and the other contains the reference distance .",
    "this further reduces the number of distinct tetrahedra by a factor of @xmath146 .",

    "however , @xmath89 hyperplanes ( among which one contains the reference distance and the others are perpendicular to it ) can be identified that are mirror reflection hyperplanes of the simplex .",

    "i , a knowledge of atomic structures of condensed matter can be obtained via x - ray scattering experiments . in particular , the two - body distribution function @xmath25 is related to the fourier transform of the structure factor @xmath212 , which is proportional to the scattering intensities ( with the atomic structure function removed ) . for ideal crystalline structures ( without any thermal agitation of the atomic centers ) , @xmath2 consists of a series of dirac delta functions at specific distances . for disordered structures ( lack of long - range order ) , @xmath2 is generally a continuous damped oscillating function that decays to its long - range value very quickly .",
    "interestingly , it seems that though the pair information contained in @xmath2 of the crystalline matter would determine the structures to high accuracy , it is not the case for disordered structures .    the reason can be easily seen if we consider the @xmath3 space . for an ordered point configuration ( i.e. , a lattice ) , there are strong dependencies among the distances besides those required by the feasibility conditions .",
    "for example , consider a @xmath4-dimensional bravais lattice whose basis vectors are @xmath213 .",
    "the vector connecting any two points in the lattice can then be expressed as    @xmath214    where @xmath215 ( @xmath216 ) are integers .",
    "thus , the distance @xmath4 between any two lattice points are given by    @xmath217    where @xmath218 denotes the inner product of two vectors .",
    "note that @xmath219 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq18 ] ) implies that every distance of an ordered point configuration can be obtained if the lengths of the basis lattice vectors and the distances between the end points of different basis lattice vectors are specified .",
    "in other words , eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) further reduces the free dimensions of the @xmath3 space of the ordered point configuration in @xmath5 to @xmath155 .",
    "the additional conditions given by eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) significantly reduce the number of feasible permutations of the distances .",
    "a unique feature of the distances for lattices is that the basis lattice vectors are associated with the smallest distances . to completely reconstruct the lattice configuration , the smallest @xmath220 distances are selected to be assembled into a simplex in @xmath5 defined by the common origin and the end points of all the lattice vectors , which in turn determines the fundamental cell of the lattice . in @xmath40 ,",
    "three feasible distances uniquely determine a triangle and thus , the rhombical fundamental cell . in @xmath110 , there are maximally 30 ways that the 6 distances could be assembled into a tetrahedron .",
    "however , even for a two - fold degeneracy , the number of equality constraints introduced by eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) ( i.e. , for two permutations of the 6 distances , eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) should hold simultaneously ) is much larger than the free dimensions of the system , which generally rules out all non - trivial solutions .",
    "indeed , it is known that for @xmath221 , pair distances are sufficient to uniquely determine bravais lattices . however , in high dimensions , degeneracies of bravais lattices can be constructed @xcite .    for a disordered structure , eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) does not hold and the values of distances would form a continuous spectrum in the infinite volume limit .",
    "we consider the idealized case that there are a finite number of well defined distances and try to reconstruct the configuration from them .",
    "an important point is that no matter how carefully experiments might be carried out , there would still be small but finite errors associated with the distances , i.e. , @xmath222 , where @xmath223 denotes the real value of the distance and @xmath224 denotes the error .",
    "thus , instead of a single point in the @xmath3 space , the distances correspond to a small uncertainty region with same dimensions as the @xmath3 space .",
    "as we have pointed out , the presence of degeneracies corresponds to a feasible region with reduced free dimension , and thus has vanishing `` volume '' compared with the feasible region free of degeneracies , which leads us to the conclusion that degeneracies are rare in general .",
    "however , due to the uncertainties of the measured distances , we see that the feasible regions now are `` finite '' in size compared with those free of degeneracies .",
    "this explains why in the reconstructions it is hard to exactly recover the target configurations , i.e. , all configurations associated with the distances corresponding to the points in the feasible region should be considered with equal probability for a `` fair '' reconstruction procedure .",
    "recently , torquato and stillinger @xcite proposed a decorrelation principle concerning the disordered hard - sphere packings in high dimensional euclidean space @xmath5 . in particular , the decorrelation principle states that unconstrained spatial correlations vanish for disordered packings as the spatial dimension becomes large . in other words , as @xmath4 increases",
    ", the short - ranged order beyond contact that exists in low dimensions must diminish .",
    "this principle has been explicitly observed in a variety of disordered packings in high dimensions @xcite .",
    "the centroids of the hard spheres completely determine a packing , which can be considered as a point configuration in @xmath5 in which there is a minimum value of pair separation distances @xmath225 ( i.e. , the diameter of the spheres ) due to the nonoverlapping condition .",
    "the decorrelation principle amounts to the following statement concerning the @xmath3 space of the configuration : the requirement that the distances can not be smaller than @xmath225 does not affect the occurrence frequency of distances with values greater than @xmath225 in very high dimensions . note the above",
    "should be true for any disordered packings , including both dilute and jammed packings .",
    "it is known that in low dimensions , @xmath226 can only be maintained for packings with densities less than a critical value @xcite and for disordered jammed packings @xmath2 shows strong short - ranged oscillations @xcite , which is the manifestation of local spatial correlations due to the nonoverlapping constraint . in other words , for the jammed disordered packings , the requirement that a desired number of distances of value @xmath225 must be realized in the configuration strongly constrains the possible values of other distances in low dimensions , especially those on the same magnitude of @xmath225 . in high dimensions ,",
    "the above requirement becomes less significant in determining the local arrangements of points .",
    "consider the construction used in deriving the feasibility conditions , to completely determine the position of a point in @xmath5 , a `` reference '' structure containing at least @xmath4 points is used .",
    "the positions of the points in the reference structure can be chosen almost freely subject to the mild constraint that no two points can be closer than @xmath225 .",
    "as @xmath4 increases , larger local structures ( containing more points ) can be constructed before the constraints on the separation distances between the points begin to play an important role . in additions",
    ", there are @xmath227 ways to arrange a point that has fixed distances to @xmath228 ( @xmath229 ) points in @xmath5 .",
    "thus , as @xmath230 , the constraints on the pair - distance values imposed by the requirement that a desired number of distances with value @xmath225 must be realized become insignificant , which is consistent with the decorrelation principle .",
    "as we have shown , pair - distance statistics in general is not sufficient information to completely determine the point configuration .",
    "a natural question is what additional information could be used to further reduce the compatible configurations associated with identical radial distribution functions .",
    "a conventional choice is the three - body correlation function @xmath19 @xcite , which provides information how the pair distances should be linked into triangles .",
    "though in certain circumstances @xmath19 could provide additional information on the point configuration , its determination requires additional effort to obtain either theoretically or computationally .",
    "it has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that instead of incorporating information contained higher - order versions of @xmath2 , namely , @xmath19 , @xmath231 , etc .",
    ", one might be better served to seek other descriptors at the two - point level , which can be both manageably measured and yet reflect nontrivial higher - order structural information .",
    "one such quantity is the pair - connectedness function @xmath51 @xcite , ( i.e. , the connectedness contribution to @xmath2 ) , which contains non - trivial topological connectedness information of the point configuration . note the  connectedness \" in a point configuration can be defined in many ways , e.g. , one could circumscribe spheres sround each of the points and then define that two points are connected if the two associated spheres are either contacting or overlapping , for example .",
    "connectedness information contained in @xmath51 is distinct from the `` triangular '' information embodied in @xmath19 , e.g. , @xmath51 is sensitive to clustering effects , whereas @xmath19 is not .",

    "i , two - phase media can be constructed by decorating point configurations .",
    "for example , one can construct sphere packings by assigning to each point a sphere centered at the point with diameter equal to the minimal distance in the configuration . in this sense ,",
    "two - phase media are more general than point configurations .",
    "the degeneracy of discrete point configurations implies the existence of degenerate two - phase media .",

    "[ fig_medium ] , suppose we have two large solid circles in which small circular holes are made .",
    "one large circle contains the `` kite '' holes and the other contains the `` trapezoid '' holes .",
    "since initially the two solid large circles are characterized by identical infinite distance set and the same subset of distances are then removed to make the holes , the remaining sets of distances for the two large circles with holes are still identical .",
