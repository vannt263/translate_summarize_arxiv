    "in many concrete situations the statistician observes a finite path @xmath0 of a real temporal phenomena .",
    "a common modeling is to assume that the observation is a finite path of a second order weak stationary process @xmath1 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the random variable ( r.v . )",
    "@xmath2 is , for any @xmath3 , square integrable and that the mean and the covariance structure of the process is invariant by any translation on the time index .",
    "that is , for any @xmath4 @xmath5 does not depend on @xmath6 and @xmath7 only depends on the distance between @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "a more popular frame is the gaussian case where the additional gaussianity assumption on all finite marginal distributions of the process @xmath9 is added . in this case , as the multidimensional gaussian distribution only depends on moments of order one and two , the process is also strongly stationary .",
    "this means that the law of all finite dimensional marginal distributions are invariant if the time is shifted : @xmath10 gaussian stationary process are very popular because they share plenty of very nice properties concerning their statistics or prediction ( see , for example , @xcite or @xcite ) . hence , an important topic in the field of stationary process is the implementation of a statistical procedure that allows to assess gaussianity . in the last three decades",
    ", many works have been developed to build such methods .",
    "for example , in @xcite a test based on the analysis of the empirical characteristic function is performed . in @xcite",
    "based on the skewness and kurtosis test or also called jarque - bera test . in @xcite",
    "based on both , empirical characteristic function and skewness and kurtosis . in @xcite",
    "we can find another test , this based on the bispectral density function .",
    "an important drawback of these tests is that they only consider a finite order marginal of the process ( generally the order one marginal ! ) .",
    "obviously , this provides tests at the right level for the intended problem ; but these tests could be at the nominal power against some non - gaussian alternatives .",
    "for example , in the case of a strictly stationary non - gaussian process having one - dimensional gaussian marginal .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a procedure to assess that a strictly stationary process is gaussian .",
    "our test is consistent against every strictly stationary alternative satisfying regularity assumptions .",
    "the procedure is a combination of the random projection method ( see @xcite and @xcite ) and classical methods that allow to assess that the one - dimensional marginal of a stationary process is gaussian ( see the previous discussion ) .",
    "regarding the random projection method , we follow the same methodology as the one proposed in @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "it is shown therein that ( only ) a random projection characterizes a probability distribution .",
    "in particular , we employ the results of @xcite where the main result of @xcite is generalized to obtain goodness - of - fit tests for families of distributions , and in particular for gaussian families .",
    "therefore , given a strictly stationary process , @xmath11 , we are interested in constructing a test for the null hypothesis @xmath12 .",
    "notice that @xmath13 holds if , and only if , @xmath14 is gaussian . so that , using the random projection method , @xcite , this is , roughly speaking , equivalent to that a ( one - dimensional ) randomly chosen projection of @xmath14 is gaussian .",
    "this idea allows to translate the problem into another one consisting on checking when the one - dimensional marginal of a random transformation of @xmath11 is gaussian .",
    "this can be tested using a usual procedure . here",
    ", we will employ the well - known epps test , @xcite , and lobato and velasco skewness - kurtosis test , @xcite .",
    "we also use a combination of them as a way to alleviate some problems that those tests present .    furthermore , epps test checks whether the characteristic function of the one - dimensional marginal of a strictly stationary process coincides with the one of a gaussian distribution .",
    "this checking is performed on a fixed finite set of points . as a consequence",
    ", it can not be consistent against every possible non - gaussian alternative with non - gaussian marginal .",
    "however , in our work , the points employed in epps test will be also drawn at random .",
    "this will provide the consistency of the whole test . regarding lobato and velasco skewness - kurtosis test",
    "we will prove the consistency of the test under different hypothesis than those in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will give some basic definitions and notations .",
    "in section [ juan ] , we discuss some useful known results .",
    "one concerns the random projection method , some gaussianity tests for strictly stationary processes and another a procedure for multiple testing .",

    "so , we take @xmath422 @xmath423 distributed as the absolute value of a standard normal distribution and @xmath424 distributed as the absolute value of a normal distribution with mean zero and variance @xmath425 with this selection , although seldom , we have found that @xmath426 could be singular .",
    "this is the main reason to choose @xmath109 as the generalized inverse of @xmath427    another important practical issue is the procedure used to find the minimizer nearest to @xmath306 of the map @xmath428 in the simulations of @xcite and @xcite they use the simplex method developed in @xcite .",

    "thus , in order to detect a non - gaussian marginal , it is wise to select @xmath188 and @xmath208 in such a way that @xmath284 is small or even @xmath99 or @xmath441 .",

    ", a selection like @xmath449 and @xmath450 seems appropriate .",
    "therefore , it seems that in a practical situation we should decide which alternative is more plausible and then , select the appropriate parameters .",

    "this is our proposal .",
    "finally , we need a gaussianity test for the one dimensional marginal of @xmath451 . we have seen two such tests ( which have some advantages and disadvantages discussed in section [ simu ] ) and we can also mix them . having all these requirements in mind , we propose the following procedure :    1 .",
    "draw @xmath452 with the @xmath453 distribution and apply epps test to the projections to obtain the @xmath156-value @xmath454 .",
    "2 .   draw @xmath455 ( independently of @xmath452 ) with the @xmath453 distribution and apply lobato and velasco test to the projections to obtain the @xmath156-value @xmath456 .",

    "combine the @xmath156-values @xmath462 using the procedure described in section [ mt ] to decide the gaussianity hypothesis at the level @xmath162 .",
    "thus , ordering these four @xmath156-values such that @xmath463 we obtain that the @xmath156-value of the random projection test is equal to @xmath464",
    "in this section we study the behavior of the proposed procedure in different situations .",
    "we have used the same distributions as in @xcite , in order to perform comparisons .",

    "we have performed 5000 simulations in each situation . in every run we have computed the @xmath156-values using the asymptotic distributions .",
    "this could have caused that sometimes the rejection rates under the null hypothesis are far away from the nominal level ( mostly for the lowest sample size @xmath489 ) and that they decrease under some alternatives with the sample size ( mostly for high values of @xmath484 ) .",
    "there are some differences between our rates and those published in @xcite .",
    "we think they could be due to the fact that the _ past _ taken in @xcite is not large enough .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath489 , @xmath490 and @xmath469 being @xmath477 we obtain a rejection rate of @xmath491 when using epps test while in @xcite they obtain one of @xmath492 which is appreciatively worse .",

    "furthermore , another difference to bold between what we do here and @xcite is that in subsection [ conlv ] a sum until @xmath500 is involved in the estimation of @xmath501 while in @xcite the sum goes until @xmath502 where @xmath25 is the sample size . here",
