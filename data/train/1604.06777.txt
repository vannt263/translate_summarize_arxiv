    "to understand or predict surface flow properties during an extreme food event , models based on 2d shallow water equations ( swes ) using high resolution description of the environment are commonly used in practical engineering applications . in that case , the main role of hydraulic models is to finely describe overland flow maximal water depth reached at some specific points or area of interest .",
    "in complex urban environment , above ground surface features have a major influence on overland flow path , their implementations ( buildings , walls , sidewalks ) in hydraulic model are therefore required as shown in @xcite .",
    "the representation of details surface features within models can be achieved through the use of high resolution digital elevation models ( hr dems ) .",
    "geomatics community intensively uses urban reconstruction relying on airborne topographic data gathering technologies such as imagery and light detection and ranging ( lidar ) scans to produce hr dem @xcite .",
    "these technologies allow producing dem with a high accuracy level @xcite .",
    "moreover , modern technologies , such as unmanned aerial vehicle ( uva ) use , make high resolution lidar or imagery born data easily affordable in terms of time and financial investments @xcite .",
    "consequently , hydraulic numerical modelling community increasingly uses hr dem information from airborne technologies to model urban flood @xcite . among hr topographic data , photogrammetry technology allows the production of 3d classified topographic data @xcite .",
    "this type of data is useful for surface hydraulic modelling community as it provides classified information on complex environments .",
    "it gives the possibility to select useful information for a dem creation specifically adapted for flood modelling purposes @xcite . even though hr classified data have high horizontal and vertical accuracy levels ( in a range of few centimeters ) , this data set is assorted of errors and uncertainties .",
    "moreover , in order to optimize models creation and numerical computation , hydraulic modellers make choices regarding procedure for this type of dataset use",
    ". these sources of uncertainties might produce variability in hydraulic flood models outputs .",
    "addressing models output variability related to model input parameters uncertainty is an active topic which is one of the main concern for practitioners and decision makers involved in assessment and development of flood mitigation strategies @xcite . to tackle a part of the uncertainty in modelling approaches",
    ", practitioners are developing methods which enable to understand and reduce results variability related to input parameters uncertainty such as global sensitivity analysis ( gsa ) @xcite .",

    "<S> technologies such as aerial photogrammetry allow production of 3d topographic data including complex environments such as urban areas . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is possible to create high resolution ( hr ) digital elevation models ( dem ) incorporating thin above ground elements influencing overland flow paths . </S>",
    "<S> even though this category of `` big data '' has a high level of accuracy , there are still errors in measurements and hypothesis under dem elaboration . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , operators look for optimizing spatial discretization resolution in order to improve flood models computation time . errors in measurement , errors in dem generation , and operator choices for inclusion of this data within 2d hydraulic model , might influence results of flood models simulations . these errors and hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> may influence significantly flood modelling results variability . the purpose of this study is to investigate uncertainties related to ( @xmath0 ) the own error of high resolution topographic data , and ( @xmath1 ) the modeller choices when including topographic data in hydraulic codes . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to perform a global sensitivity analysis ( gsa ) which goes through a monte - carlo uncertainty propagation , to quantify impact of uncertainties , followed by a sobol indices computation , to rank influence of identified parameters on result variability . </S>",
    "<S> a process using a coupling of an environment for parametric computation ( promthe ) and a code relying on 2d shallow water equations ( fullswof_2d ) has been developed ( p - fs tool ) . </S>",
    "<S> the study has been performed over the lower part of the var river valley using the estimated hydrograph of @xmath2 flood event . </S>",
    "<S> hr topographic data has been made available for the study area , which is @xmath3 , by nice municipality . </S>",
    "<S> three uncertain parameters were studied : the measurement error ( var . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 ) , the level of details of above - ground element representation in dem ( buildings , sidewalks , _ etc . _ ) ( var . </S>",

    "<S> a database of @xmath7 simulations has been produced using p - fs tool implemented on a high performance computing structure . in our study case , </S>",
    "<S> the output of interest is the maximal water surface reached during simulations . </S>",
    "<S> a stochastic sampling on the produced result database has allowed to perform a monte - carlo approach . </S>",
    "<S> sensitivity index have been produced at given points of interest , enhancing the relative weight of each uncertain parameter on variability of calculated overland flow . </S>",
