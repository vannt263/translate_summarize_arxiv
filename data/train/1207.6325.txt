    "on electronic markets , the market platform fixes a grid on which traders can place their prices .",
    "the grid step represents the smallest interval between two prices and is called the _ tick value _ ( measured in the currency of the asset ) . for a given security , it is safe to consider this grid to be evenly spaced even though the market may change it at times . in some markets ,",
    "the spacing of the grid can depend on the price .",
    "for example , stocks traded on euronext paris have a price dependent tick scheme .",
    "stocks priced @xmath0 to @xmath1 euros have a tick value of @xmath2 euro but all stocks above @xmath3 euros have a tick value of @xmath4 euro .",
    "however , when it comes to actual trading , the tick value is given little consideration .",
    "what is important is the so called _",
    "tick size_. a trader considers that an asset has a small tick size when he  feels \" it to be negligible , in other words , when he is not averse to price variations of the order of a single tick . in general then , the trader s perception of the tick size is qualitative and empirical , and depends on many parameters such as the tick value , the price , the usual amounts traded in the asset and even his own trading strategy .",
    "all this leads to the following well known remark : the tick value is not a good absolute measure of the perceived size of the tick .",
    "it has to be viewed relatively to other market statistics .",
    "for instance , every trader  considers \" that the esx index futures has a much greater tick than the dax index futures though their tick values have the same order of magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , the notion of `` large tick asset '' is rather well understood . for eisler , bouchaud and kockelkoren",
    "@xcite :  large tick stocks are such that the bid - ask spread is almost always equal to one tick , while small tick stocks have spreads that are typically a few ticks \" .",
    "we borrow this definition in this work .",
    "this type of asset lead to the following specific issues which we address in this paper :    * how to quantify more precisely the tick sizes of large tick assets ? * many studies have pointed out special relationships between the spread and some market quantities .",
    "however , these studies reach a limit when discussing large tick assets since the spread is artificially bounded from below . how to extend these studies to this kind of asset ?",
    "* what happens to the relevant market quantities when the market designer decides to change the tick value and what is then the optimal tick value ?",
    "this last question is a crucial issue facing by market designers and regulators today , see for example @xcite .",
    "this is shown by the numerous changes and come back recently operated on the tick values on various exchanges . in particular , the tick value is one of the main tools the exchanges have at their disposal to attract / prevent high frequency trading . to our knowledge , this question has been surprisingly quite ignored in the quantitative financial economics literature .",
    "we believe our approach is a first quantitative step towards solving this important and intricate problem .    in this paper , in order to address the questions related to the tick value",
    ", we present a framework that allows us to link some microstructural features of the asset together . in the literature , such attempts",
    "have been considered many times and in the following two paragraphs we recall two approaches leading to important relationships between the spread and other market quantities in the case of small tick assets .",
    "however , these works focusing particularly on the spread , they are not relevant when dealing with large tick assets since in that case , the spread is collapsed to the minimum and is equal to one tick .",
    "we draw inspiration from these theories and investigate the existence of a variable that can be used in lieu of the spread in the case of large tick assets .",
    "the way the spread settles down in the market is widely studied in the microstructure literature , see for example @xcite . in particular , several theoretical models have been built in order to understand the determinants of the spread ,",
    "see @xcite . here",
    "we give a here a brief , simplified , overview of madhavan , richardson , roomans seminal paper @xcite about the link between spread and volatility .",
    "in @xcite , the authors assume the existence of a _ true _ or _ efficient price _ for the asset with ex post value @xmath5 after the i@xmath6 trade and that all transactions have the same volume .",
    "then they consider the following dynamic for the efficient price :    @xmath7    with @xmath8 an iid centered shock component ( new information ,  ) with variance @xmath9 , @xmath10 the sign of the i@xmath6 trade and @xmath11 an impact parameter .",
    "note that , in order to simplify the presentation , we assume here that the @xmath10 are independent ( in @xcite , the authors allow for short term dependence in the @xmath10 ) .",
    "the idea in @xcite is then to consider that market makers can not guess the surprise of the next trade .",
    "so , they post ( pre trade ) bid and ask prices @xmath12 and @xmath13 given by @xmath14 with @xmath15 an extra compensation claimed by market makers , covering processing costs and the shock component risk .",
    "the above rule ensures no ex post regret for the market makers : if @xmath16 , the traded price is on average the right one .",
    "in particular , the ex post average cost of a market order with respect to the efficient price @xmath17 or @xmath18 is equal to @xmath0 .",
    "the madhavan _",
    "_ model allows to compute several relevant quantities . in this approach",
    ", we obtain that for approximation . ]",
    "* the spread @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 . * neglecting the contribution of the news component , see for example @xcite for details , the variance per trade of the efficient price @xmath21 satisfies @xmath22=\\theta^2+v^2\\sim \\theta^2.\\ ] ] * therefore : @xmath23    this last relation , which gives a very precise link between the spread and the volatility per trade , will be one of the cornerstones of our study .",
    "we recall now the wyart _ et al .",
    "_ approach , see @xcite , which is another way to derive the proportionality between the spread and the volatility per trade . here again , the idea is to use the dichotomy between market makers and market takers .",
    "market makers are patient traders who prefer to send limit orders and wait to be executed , thus avoiding to cross the spread but taking on volatility risk .",
    "market takers are impatient traders who prefer to send market orders and get immediate execution , thus avoiding volatility risk but crossing the spread in the process .",
    "_ consider a generic market making strategy on an asset and show that its average profit and loss per trade per unit of volume can be well approximated by the formula @xmath24 where @xmath19 denotes the average spread and @xmath25 is a constant depending on the asset , but which is systematically between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this profit and loss should correspond to the average cost of a market order .",
    "then wyart _ et al .",
    "_ argue that on electronic market , any agent can chose between market orders and limit orders .",
    "consequently the market should stabilize so that both types of orders have the same average ( ex post ) cost , that is zero .",
    "indeed , because of the competition between liquidity providers , the spread is the smallest admissible value such that the profit of the market makers is non negative ( otherwise another market maker would come with a tighter spread ) .",
    "thus , if the tick size allows for it , the spread is so that market makers do not make profit",
    ". therefore , in this case : @xmath28 moreover , in @xcite , wyart _ et al .",
    "_ show that this relationship is very well satisfied on market data .",
    "the goal of this work is to provide a framework linking microstructural properties of the asset to the tick value of the exchange . because the microstructure manifests itself through the statistics of the high frequency returns and durations ,",
    "our approach is to find a formula connecting the tick value to these statistics . as a consequence of that , we are able to predict these statistics whenever a change in the tick value is scheduled .",
    "furthermore , we can determine beforehand what should the value of the tick be if the market designer has a certain set of high frequency statistics he wants to achieve .    in order to reach that goal",
    ", we bring to light a quantity , referred to as _ implicit spread _ , playing the role of spread for large tick assets , for which the effective spread is almost always equal to one tick .",
    "in particular , it enables us to quantify the tick sizes of this type of asset and to define a notion of _ optimal tick size_. the implicit spread is introduced thanks to a statistical model described in section [ uz ] . in order to validate the fact that our new quantity can be seen as a spread for large tick assets , we show in section [ num ] the striking validity of the relationship between spread and volatility per trade mentioned above on various electronically traded large tick assets , provided the spread",
    "is replaced by the implicit spread .",
    "we also explain this relationship from a theoretical point of view through a very simple equilibrium model in section [ theo ] .",
    "finally , in section [ change ] , we show that these results enable us to forecast the behavior of relevant market quantities after a change in the tick value and to give a way to modify it in order to reach an optimal tick size .",
    "the implicit spread can be naturally explained in the framework of the model with uncertainty zones developed in @xcite .",
    "note that we could introduce this notion without referring to this model .",
    "however , using it is very convenient in order to give simple intuitions .",
    "the model with uncertainty zones is a model for transaction prices and durations ( more precisely , only transactions leading to a price change are modeled ) .",
    "it is a _ statistical model _ , which means it has been designed in order to reproduce the stylized facts observed on the market and to be useful for practitioners .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that this model indeed reproduces ( almost ) all the main stylized facts of prices and durations at any frequency ( from low frequency data to ultra high frequency data ) . in practice , this model is particularly convenient in order to estimate relevant parameters such as the volatility or the covariation at the ultra high frequency level , see @xcite , or when one wants to hedge a derivative in an intraday manner , see @xcite .    a priori ,",
    "such a model is not firmly rooted on individual behaviors of the agents .",
    "however since it reproduces what is seen on the market , the way market participants act has to be consistent with the model .",
    "therefore , as explained in the rest of this section and in section [ theo ] , ex post , an agent based interpretation of such a statistical model can still be given .",
    "the heuristic of the model is very simple . when the bid - ask is given , market takers know the price for which they can buy and the price for which they can sell . however , they have their own opinion about the  fair \" price of the asset , inferred from all available market data and their personal views . in the latter ,",
    "we assume that there exists an efficient price , representing this opinion . of course this efficient price",
    "should not be seen as an `` economic price '' of the asset , but rather as a market consensus at a given time about the asset value .",
    "the idea of the model with uncertainty zones is that for large tick assets , at a given time , the difference between the efficient price and the best accessible price on the market for buying ( resp .",
    "selling ) is sometimes too large so that a buy ( resp . sell )",
    "market order can occur .",
    "we propose here a simplified version of the model with uncertainty zones , see @xcite for a more general version .",
    "the first assumption on the model is the following :    * _ there is a latent efficient price with value @xmath29 at time @xmath30 , which is a continuous semi - martingale of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a @xmath33-brownian motion , with @xmath34 a filtration for which @xmath35 is progressively measurable and locally bounded and @xmath36 is an adapted right continuous left limited process . _    following in particular the works by at - sahalia _ et al .",
    "_ , see @xcite , using such kind of efficient price process when building a microstructure model has become very popular in the recent financial econometrics literature .",
    "indeed , it enables to easily retrieve standard brownian type dynamics in the low frequencies , which is in agreement with both the behavior of the data and the classical mathematical finance theory .",
    "also , our assumptions on the efficient price process are very weak , allowing in particular for any kind of time varying or stochastic volatility .",
    "of course this efficient price is not directly observed by market participants .",
    "however , they may have their own opinion about its value .",
    "let @xmath37 be the tick value of the asset .",
    "we define the uncertainty zones as bands around the mid tick values with width @xmath38 , with @xmath39 a given parameter .",
    "the dynamics of the last traded price , denoted by @xmath40 , is obtained as a functional of the efficient price and the uncertainty zones .",
    "indeed , in order to change the transaction price , we consider that market takers have to be `` convinced '' that it is reasonable , meaning that the efficient price must be close enough to a new potential transaction price .",
    "this is translated in assumption h@xmath27 .",
    "* _ let @xmath41 be any given time and @xmath42 the associated last traded price value .",
    "let @xmath43 be the first time after @xmath41 where @xmath29 upcrosses the uncertainty zone above @xmath42 , that is hits the value @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 be the first time after @xmath41 where @xmath29 downcrosses the uncertainty zone below @xmath42 , that is hits the value @xmath46 .",
    "then , one can not have a transaction at some time @xmath47 at a price strictly higher ( resp .",
    "smaller ) than @xmath42 before @xmath43 ( resp .",
    "@xmath45 ) . moreover , if @xmath48 ( resp .",
    "@xmath49 ) one does have a transaction at the new price @xmath50 ( resp .",
    "@xmath51 ) at time @xmath43 ( resp .",
    "@xmath45 ) .",
    "_    in fact , when associating it to assumption h@xmath52 , we will see that assumption h@xmath27 can be understood as follows : at any given time , a buy ( resp .",
    "sell ) market order can not occur if the current value of the efficient price is too far from the best ask ( resp .",
    "bid ) .    remark",
    "that assumption h@xmath27 implies that the transaction price only jumps by one tick , which is fairly reasonable for large tick assets .",
    "however , imposing jumps of only one tick and that a transaction occurs exactly at the times the efficient price exits an uncertainty zone is done only for technical convenience .",
    "indeed , it can be easily relaxed in the setting of the model with uncertainty zones , see @xcite .",
    "a sample path of the last traded price in the model with uncertainty zones is given in figure [ fig : le_graphenodelay2 ] .    .",
    "the red dotted lines are the limits of the uncertainty zones of width @xmath38 .",
    "finally the last traded price is the black stepwise curve .",
    "the circles indicate a change in the price when the efficient price crosses an uncertainty zone.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]      in this work , we focus on large tick assets . by this",
    "we mean assets whose bid - ask spread is essentially constant and equal to one tick",
    ". therefore we make the following assumption in the model .",
    "* _ the bid - ask spread is constant , equal to the tick value @xmath37 .",
    "_    in practice , the preceding assumption means that if at some given time the spread is not equal to one tick , limit orders immediately fill the gap .",
    "remark that we do not impose the efficient price to lie inside the bid - ask quotes .",
    "however , the dynamics of the bid - ask quotes still need to be compatible with assumption h@xmath27 .    within bid - ask quotes of the form",
    "@xmath53 $ ] , the width of the uncertainty zone represents the range of values for @xmath29 where transactions at the best bid and the best ask can both occur .",
    "the size of this range is @xmath38 .",

    "it is particularly interesting to remark that the optimal tick values suggested for the bobl are almost the same before and after the change in the tick value on 2009 , june 15 .",
    "a crucial point in our approach is that when changing the tick value of a large tick asset , the spread remains equal to one tick as long as market makers make profit with such a spread .",
    "so the spread ( in ticks ) is invariant when the tick value is modified .",
    "for a small tick asset , when enlarging the tick value , both the spread and the number of trades adjust so that the spread and the volatility per trade have of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the way these two variables are jointly modified is intricate and this is why our method can not , a priori , be used for small tick assets .",
    "however , let us stress the fact that it is still possible for the exchange to use a two step procedures in the case of a small tick asset :    * step 1 : enlarge sufficiently the tick value so that the asset becomes a large tick asset .",

    "<S> this implicit spread allows us to quantify the tick sizes of large tick assets and to define a notion of _ optimal tick size_. moreover , our results open the possibility of forecasting the behavior of relevant market quantities after a change in the tick value and to give a way to modify it in order to reach an optimal tick size .    * key words : *  microstructure of financial markets , high frequency data , large tick assets , implicit spread , market making , limit orders , market orders , optimal tick size . </S>"
