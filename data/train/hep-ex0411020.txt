    "the tevatron run ii at fermilab started to deliver @xmath1 collisions at @xmath8 tev in april 2002 .",
    "the @xmath9 production cross section at this center of mass energy is very large ( @xmath10b ) when compared to the typical @xmath11 cross sections at the @xmath12 1 nb ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 7 nb ) resonances .",
    "the @xmath9 production rate at the current record luminosity at the tevatron of @xmath14 10@xmath15 cm@xmath5 sec@xmath5 is 10 khz . at hadron colliders",
    "there is also the advantage of producing all b - flavored species from the light @xmath17 and @xmath18 mesons to the heavier @xmath19 and @xmath20 meson as well as @xmath21 baryons such as @xmath22 . on the other hand ,",
    "the problem of the hadronic environment is the high level of background due a large inelastic @xmath1 cross section of @xmath23(50 mb ) and the track multiplicity to up to 50 tracks / events due to the fragmentation of the hard intersection products plus that due to the underlying event or pile up of multiple events .",
    "the purely leptonic decay @xmath24 is a flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process@xcite . in the standard model ( sm ) , this decay is forbidden at the tree level and proceeds at a very low rate through higher order diagrams .",
    "the sm leptonic branching fraction ( @xmath25 ) were calculated including qcd corrections@xcite .",
    "the latest sm predictions@xcite is , @xmath26 , where the error is dominated by non - perturbative hadronic uncertainties .",
    "the corresponding leptonic branching fraction for the @xmath27 is suppressed by an additional factor of @xmath28 leading to a sm branching ratio of @xmath29 .",
    "cdf reported in run i the experimental bound for the branching fraction of @xmath30 @xmath31 of @xmath32 at the 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the decay amplitude of @xmath33 can be significantly enhanced in some extensions of the sm .",
    "for instance , in the type - ii two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , all contributions from the neutral higgs sector cancel out and the branching fraction depends only on the charged higgs mass @xmath34 and @xmath35 which defines the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the higgs field .",
    "the amplitude grows as @xmath36  @xcite . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "however , @xmath37 , leading to an enhancement of up to three orders of magnitude  @xcite@xmath38@xcite compared to the sm , even if mssm with minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) is considered , i.e. , the ckm matrix is the only source of flavor violation .",
    "for normalization cdf used the @xmath21 cross section as measured by the experiment in run i ; therefore , the preselection criteria were driven by the measurement of the cross section with @xmath39  6  gev and @xmath40 for events selected by dimuon triggers .",
    "in addition a set of standard track , muon ( @xmath41  gev/@xmath42 , @xmath43 ) and vertex quality cuts were applied . after restricting the invariant mass region of the dimuon pair to 4.669 to 5.696  gev/@xmath44 , 2940 events survive in a total integrated luminosity @xmath45 of 171 pb@xmath5 .",
    "d  used data collected by dimuon tiggers with two muons of opposite charge that form a common secondary 3d - vertex with an invariant mass between 4.5 and 7.0 gev/@xmath44 . each muon candidate had to have @xmath46gev/@xmath42 , @xmath47 and a sufficient number of hits in the central tracking station . to ensure a similar @xmath48 dependence of the @xmath49 system in the signal and in the normalization channel",
    ", @xmath50 had to be greater than 5  gev/@xmath42 .",
    "after the preselection , 38,167 events survive in a integrated luminosity of 240 pb@xmath5 .",
    "both experiments have chosen a set of similar discriminating variables to best exploit the properties of the decay .",
    "the long lifetime of the @xmath51 meson has been used to cut against random combinatoric background due to short lived particles . while cdf uses a minimum proper lifetime @xmath52 of the @xmath53 candidate , d   is using decay length significance @xmath54 .",
    "the fragmentation characteristics of the @xmath21 quark are such that most of its momentum is carried by the @xmath21 hadron .",
    "the number of extra tracks near the b candidate therefore tends to be small .",
    "the second discriminant was therefore an isolation variable , @xmath55 , of the muon pair , defined as : @xmath56 here , @xmath57 is the scalar sum over all tracks excluding the muon pair within a cone of @xmath58 around the momentum vector @xmath59 of the muon pair where @xmath60 .",
    "the cdf definition differs by using the transverse momentum of the tracks instead of the momentum .    as a third variable the angle ( @xmath61 ) between the momentum vector of the muon pair and the vector from the primary to the secondary vertex has been used",
    "this requirement ensures consistency between the direction of the decay vertex and the momentum vector of the @xmath62 candidate .",
    "* cdf * + for a given number of observed events , @xmath63 , consistent with the background estimate , @xmath64 , the upper limit on the branching ratio is determined using : @xmath65 where n(@xmath66 ) is the number of candidate decays at 90% c.l .",
    ", estimated using a bayesian approach@xcite and incorporating the uncertainties into the limit .",
    "the integrated luminosity is @xmath45 , the @xmath53 production cross section is @xmath67@xcite with @xmath68@xcite ) and @xmath69 is the total acceptance times efficiency , obtained from data and monte carlo .",
    "the factor of two is necessary , since the analysis is sensitive to the charge conjugate @xmath21 hadron .",
    "the optimization was done with approximately 100 combinations of the discriminating variables and maximized the _ a priori _ expected limit which is given by the sum over all possible observations , @xmath63 , weighted by the corresponding possion probability of the expected @xmath64 .",
    "the optimization of the discriminating variables ( c@xmath70 , @xmath71 rad , @xmath72 ) predicted 1.05@xmath730.30 background events in 171 pb@xmath5 .",
    "+   + a random grid search and an optimization procedure@xcite was used to find the optimal cut values of the discriminating variables by maximizing the variable @xmath74 . here , @xmath75 is the reconstruction efficiency of the signal events relative to the preselection ( estimated using mc ) , and @xmath76 is the expected number of background events interpolated from the sidebands .",
    "the constant @xmath77 is the number of standard deviations corresponding to the confidence level at which the signal hypothesis is tested .",
    "this constant @xmath77 was set to 2.0 , corresponding to about the 95% c.l .",
    "the result ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 rad , @xmath80 ) of the optimization leads to a background prediction of 3.7@xmath731.1 events in 240pb @xmath5 .    in the absence of an apparent signal a limit on the branching fraction @xmath81",
    "can then be computed by normalizing the upper limit of number of events in the @xmath82 signal region to the number of reconstructed @xmath83 events : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the upper limit on the number of signal decays estimated from the number of observed events and expected background events including systematic uncertainties using the feldman and cousins ordering scheme for the mc integration@xcite .",
    "the number of observed @xmath86 events is @xmath87 , @xmath88/@xmath89 is the efficiency ratio of the signal and normalization channels , obtained from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations",
    ". the fragmentation ratio of a @xmath21 or @xmath90 quark producing a @xmath30 and a @xmath91 or @xmath92 is @xmath93  @xcite and @xmath94 and @xmath95  @xcite are the measured branching ratios of the normalization channel .",
    "both experiments have used a blind analysis technique , hiding the signal region until the analysis was completed .",
    "the invariant mass spectra after unblinding are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_mass ] .",
    "no excess of a signal has been seen in either of the two experiments .",
    "cdf observed one event with an invariant mass of @xmath96 gev/@xmath44 , thus falling into both the @xmath30 and @xmath27 mass window . since this is consistent with the expected background of 1.1@xmath730.3 events in each of the mass windows ( @xmath7380 mev around the corresponding pdg mass ) , 95%(90% ) cl limits@xcite of @xmath97 and @xmath98",
    "are found .",
    "+ d  found four candidate events in the invariant mass region of @xmath73180 mev of the expected@xcite @xmath30 mass , which is also consistent with the expectation of 3.7@xmath731.1 background events .",
    "this gives a resulting limit@xcite on the branching fraction at 95% ( 90% ) cl of @xmath99 .",
    "this limit assumes that there are no contributions from @xmath100 decays in the search region .",
    "any non - negligible contribution due to @xmath27 decays would make the obtained limit on the branching fraction smaller .",
    "the limit presented for @xmath101 is therefore conservative and is even more stringent to constrain models of new physics beyond the sm .",
