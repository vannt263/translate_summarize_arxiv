    "in 1961 , skyrme proposed an idea that the baryon can be described as a classical soliton in non - linear meson field theories , called `` skyrmion ''  @xcite .",

    ", the importance of ( axial ) vector mesons for the skyrmion is naturally expected .",
    "one of convenient approaches for meson phenomenologies is the `` hidden local symmetry ( hls ) ''  @xcite , where @xmath1 meson is introduced as the dynamical gauge boson of the hidden local symmetry in the non - linear sigma model with @xmath10 .",
    "skyrmions with @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath11 mesons are discussed in hls and its extended models  @xcite .",

    "is known to reproduce many phenomenological aspects in hadron physics _",
    "semi - quantitatively _ , from dual classical supergravity calculations .",
    "however , important aspects in the _ difference _ between flat space phenomenologies and holographic approach have not been so much investigated .    in this paper , we compare the skyrmion in hls and that in holographic qcd , and find that they have significantly different soliton solutions , particularly in the vector - meson profiles , due to the existence of the extra - dimension and its nontrivial curvature . as a result",

[ hls_sche1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , by increasing the coupling strength @xmath31 , pion field @xmath52 is pulled up to outside of baryon , while @xmath1 meson field @xmath53 is pulled down to inside .",

    "however , the repulsive effect of @xmath1 meson was found to be canceled by @xmath2 meson in hls@xmath59 , giving the catastrophic instability of skyrmions .",

    "second , the relation @xmath83 does _ not _ hold .",

    "this implies that the kinetic term of the @xmath1 meson differs from yang - mills - type , i.e. , the @xmath1-meson field does _ not _ appear as a massive yang - mills field in four - dimensions due to the curved @xmath64-dimension , which should be compared with the case of hls with @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ l_hls_kine ] ) .",
    "in fact , the masses @xmath89 of ( axial ) vector mesons ( e.g. , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , etc . ) are given by the eigenvalues @xmath94 of the meson wave function @xmath95 in @xmath64-dimension as @xmath96  @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the existence of the curvature @xmath97 in @xmath64-dimension is essential to give the _",

    "one should note that @xmath1 meson field appears as a regular configuration with @xmath102 , not as the broad singular one with @xmath54 in sec .",
    "[ sec_hls ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath1-meson field appearing in the core region of the baryon will pull down the pion field to inside of the baryon , giving the _ weak attraction _ for the baryon with a slight shrinkage of its total size  @xcite ( see a schematic plot in fig .  [ hol_sche1 ] ) .",

    "here we note several expected features .",
    "even if @xmath2 meson is included for the skyrmion analysis in holographic qcd , there is _ no _ catastrophic instability as in the case of hls@xmath59 in sec .",
    "[ sec_hls ] by the following reasons : first , the skyrme term naturally appears from the dbi action of d8 brane as a stabilizer of the skyrmion .",
    "second , because of the relation @xmath113 in holographic qcd , @xmath1 meson has weak attraction , not strong repulsion for the baryon .",
    "therefore , even if the @xmath1-meson contributions could be canceled by @xmath2 meson , there is no catastrophic instability of skyrmion into zero size in the presense of the skyrme term .",
    "recently , the baryon is also discussed as the holonomy of an _ instanton _ in the five - dimensional gauge theory on d8 branes with d4 supergravity background  @xcite .",
    "since the instanton is introduced before the mode expansions of five - dimensional gauge field @xmath65 , one would expect that it is composed by pion and infinite tower of ( axial ) vector mesons @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116@xmath117 .",
    "actually , the dbi action of d8 brane is known to lead the instability of instanton into zero size , so that the inclusion of the chern - simons ( cs ) action is claimed as the stabilizer  @xcite , though the cs sector is , in the thooft coupling expansion , higher order contribution relative to the dbi sector .",
    "then , one might relate the instability of instanton with the instability of skyrmion with @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons as in the case of hls@xmath59 in sec .",
    "[ sec_hls ] .",
    "however , we can argue that skyrmion with @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons have _ no _ catastrophic instability in holographic qcd due to the curved extra - dimension .",
    "once the stability is established , additional inclusion of the cs sector , corresponding to the effects of the @xmath11 meson  @xcite , does not affect the present discussions of the stability with the @xmath2 meson in holographic qcd .    here",
    ", it is noted that holographic qcd has the ultraviolet cutoff scale @xmath4gev .",
    "in fact , there exist infinite number of non - qcd kaluza - klein modes in the @xmath118-compactification of d4 branes .",
    "therefore , the d4/d8/@xmath0 multi - d brane system can be regarded as qcd below the @xmath79 scale .",
    "indeed , the appearance of @xmath79 is essential to reproduce the non - susy nature in qcd , which breaks the conformal invariance to give color confinement and chiral - symmetry breaking .",
    "now , in the formation of the instanton in the five - dimensional space - time , the infinite number of non - qcd modes above @xmath79 are also included .",
    "therefore , one should be careful to their possible artifacts , which may cause the instability of the instanton . in our study",
    ", we truncate the meson resonances at the @xmath79 scale to include only the relevant qcd modes at the level of the classical supergravity .",
    "if one would like to see a fine structure of the baryon and also its excitations , a larger @xmath79 is to be taken .",
    "in such a case , heavier meson resonances are also systematically treated in a way consistent with the cutoff scale .",
    "in fact , the upper bound of @xmath79 comes from the local approximation of the fundamental strings on the d4 branes , which is compactified with a radius @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , if one can , e.g. , include the effect of finite string length in the action ( [ 5ym ] ) , @xmath79 might be taken sufficiently large with fixed @xmath120  @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the instability of the instanton into zero size might imply a need of more consistent treatment with quantum corrections and string length at short distance .",
    "such a situation may resemble that of the strong - coupling expansion in qcd with the plaquette lattice gauge action  @xcite . for a strong - coupling with large @xmath121",
    ", the expansion in powers of @xmath122 gives a basic picture of quark confinement  @xcite and chiral - symmetry breaking  @xcite , providing also an analytical method to calculate hadron properties  @xcite .",
    "the strong - coupling qcd , however , corresponds to a large lattice spacing @xmath31 , and has a limitation on its spatial resolution .",
    "then , if one includes higher - order terms of @xmath122 in the cluster expansion  @xcite , a finer structure of the theory becomes gradually visible .",
    "now , for a larger @xmath79 , the relation @xmath123 still holds due to the curvature in the extra - dimensions , and the skyrme term generally exists as a stabilizer of the skyrmion in dual of qcd , which is manifest in the classical limit as in the action ( [ 5ym ] ) . with these considerations",
    ", we can expect the stability of the skyrmion in the present study even for the larger @xmath79 , which will be more rigorously discussed elsewhere in near future .",
    "we have studied baryons as the skyrmions in hidden local symmetry ( hls ) and also in holographic qcd .",
    "we conclude that the relation @xmath113 due to the extra - dimension and its nontrivial curvature can drastically change the roles of ( axial ) vector mesons for the baryons in four - dimensions .",
    "in fact , the effective action density of yang - mills shape as @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) on the probe d8 brane can be inevitably distorted through the projection into the flat four - dimensional space - time , giving the relation @xmath113 .",
    "then , we also discuss the features of our truncated - resonance analysis for baryons with @xmath3 and @xmath1 mesons below @xmath4gev in holographic qcd .",
    "our results are not limited in the case of holographic model with d4/d8/@xmath0 multi - d brane configurations as the sakai - sugimoto model . even if one starts from any muti - d brane configurations with gauge theory on their surface , and also",
    "if one rely on the gauge / gravity duality , there is no reason for the ( axial ) vector mesons to appear as the yang - mills field with the constraint @xmath126 , because of the curved extra - dimension .",
    "note here that , in the holographic framework , the curvature in the extra - dimension is needed to give the discrete mass spectra of hadrons in the projected four - dimensional theory as qcd .",
    "furthermore , also from the phenomenological point of view in four dimensions , the constants @xmath127 and @xmath76 can be easily shifted at the quantum level , spoiling the condition @xmath126 . as a whole , our results in sec .",
    "[ sec_hol ] should be more general relative to the case of hls in sec .",
    "[ sec_hls ] .    of course",
    ", hls has an interesting physical meaning . actually ,",
    "dividing the chiral field ( [ chiral1 ] ) into a sequence of products as @xmath128 , one can introduce gauge field @xmath129@xmath130 for each gauge symmetry acting at each cutting point .",
    "if one takes the limit @xmath131 to include infinite tower of ( axial ) vector mesons , one can naturally introduce the five - dimensional gauge field @xmath132 by shifting the discrete index @xmath133 into continuous variable @xmath64 .",

    "<S> we study baryons as skyrmions in holographic qcd with d4/d8/@xmath0 multi - d brane system in type iia superstring theory , and also in the non - linear sigma model with hidden local symmetry ( hls ) . comparing these two models , we find that the extra - dimension and its nontrivial curvature can largely change the role of ( axial ) vector mesons for baryons in four - dimensional space - time . in the hls approach , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-meson field as a massive yang - mills field has a singular configuration in skyrmion , which gives a strong repulsion for the baryon as a stabilizer . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath2 meson is added in this approach , the stability of skyrmion is lost by the cancellation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 contributions . on the contrary , in holographic qcd </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath1-meson field does not appear as a massive yang - mills field due to the extra - dimension and its nontrivial curvature . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the @xmath1-meson field has a regular configuration in skyrmion , which gives a weak attraction for the baryon in holographic qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that skyrmion with @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons become stable due to the curved extra - dimension and also the presence of the skyrme term in holographic qcd . from this result </S>",
    "<S> , we also discuss the features of our truncated - resonance analysis on baryon properties with @xmath3 and @xmath1 mesons below the cutoff scale @xmath4gev in holographic qcd , which is compared with other 5d instanton analysis . </S>"
