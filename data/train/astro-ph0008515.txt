    "in previous papers ( osherovich & titarchuk 1999 ; titarchuk , osherovich 1999 , hereafter to99 ; titarchuk , osherovich & kuznetsov 1999 ) , we have suggested a new two - oscillator ( to ) model which have lead to the classification of quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpo ) in frequency range from @xmath2 hz to @xmath3 kilohertz .",
    "all oscillations in the to model are related to the local conditions in the disk .",
    "the classification offered by the to model does not include the persistent low frequency oscillations ( @xmath4 hz ) which have been observed in many neutron star and black hole candidates systems ( see reviews by van der klis 1995 and 2000 ) .",
    "we suggest in this _",
    "letter _ that these persistent low frequency oscillations are related to the global disk oscillation under the influence of the gravitational force of the central object  in contrast to the variable frequencies which are characteristic of the local properties of the disk and the magnetosphere .",
    "below we show that these persistent frequencies carry information about the system as a whole , namely , information about the size of a disk and a mass of the central object .",
    "persistent low frequency quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) with @xmath2 hz frequencies were discovered in neutron star binaries : 4u 1323 - 62 by jonker , van der klis & wijnands ( 1999 ) , exo 0748 - 676 by homan et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter h99 ) and 4u 1746 - 31 by jonker et al .",
    "recently boroson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have found a significant qpo feature with @xmath1 hz in the power density spectrum ( pds ) of uv flux from hz her / her x-1 system .",
    "similar persistent qpo features with @xmath0 hz frequencies have been found in the transient source xte j1118 + 480 in the far - ultraviolet and optical ( haswell et al .",
    "2000 ) wavelengths .",
    "the qpo feature with @xmath5 hz in xte j1118 + 480 has been also detected in the proportional counter array on rossi x - ray timing explorer ( pca / rxte ) data ( revnivtsev , sunyaev & borozdin 2000 ; wood et al .",
    "ebisawa , mitsuda , & inoue ( 1989 ) have also found a narrow 0.08 hz qpo peak in the lmc x-1 power density spectrum in the 1 - 16 kev range .",
    "it has been emphasized by h99 that several properties of the low frequency qpo , particularly its frequency and its relatively unchanged persistence during bursts and dips are remarkably similar among different stars .",
    "we suggest these qpos are caused by vertical oscillations of disk which we call the global disk mode ( gdm ) oscillations . in section 2",
    "we derive of the gdm frequency .",
    "we compare the calculations of the gdm with the qpo observations in bh sources and present a new method of the black hole mass determination using the derived gdm oscillation frequency in section 3 .",
    "comparisons with the observations in ns sources are made in section 4 .",
    "conclusions follow in section 5 .",
    "we consider the oscillations of the disk as the whole body under the influence of gravity of the central compact object shown as a black circle in figure 1 .",
    "we approximate the surface density distribution in the geometrically thin shakura - sunyaev disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) by the formula @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the innermost radius of the disk , @xmath9 is an adjustment radius in the disk and @xmath10 is the outer radius of the disk .",
    "titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov ( 1998 ; see also titarchuk & osherovich 2000 , hereafter to00 ) calculated the size of the transition disk region between the keplerian disk and the inner disk edge and they found that the typical radius of the adjustment radius depending on the effective reynold s number is within @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the disk as a whole is perturbed and it deviates from equatorial plane by a small distance @xmath12 . in figure 1",
    "we have enlarged that distance for the purpose of illustration .",
    "the restoring force @xmath13 caused by gravitational attraction of the central object is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mass of the central object and @xmath16 is the gravitational constant . after integration using the density distribution ( 1 - 2 ) with assumptions that @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "we get @xmath19.\\ ] ] the mass of the disk @xmath20 from @xmath8 to @xmath10 is @xmath21 the vertical oscillations of the disk as a whole can be described by the following equation of motion @xmath22 which can be written in the form @xmath23 using eqs .",
    "( 4 - 5 , 7 ) we present the gmd frequency as @xmath24}\\over{r_{\\rm adj}^{\\gamma } r_{\\rm out}^{2-\\gamma}}}\\right\\}^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "according to the shakura - sunyaev disk model ( 1973 ) the index @xmath30 of the surface density can be either @xmath31 or @xmath32 . for @xmath33 , and for typical parameter values of the disk model around neutron stars",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 formula ( 8) reads @xmath38 hz .",
    "for @xmath39 the value of @xmath40 is also close to 2 hz .",
    "the size of the disk @xmath10 can be estimated using the size of the roche lobe @xmath41 .",
    "following de jong , paradijs & augusteijn ( 1996 ) , we assume that the relative size of the accretion disk f=@xmath42 is approximately 0.5 .",
    "de jong et al . adopted this empirical size from eclipse - mapping observations on cataclysmic variables ( rutten et al .",
    "having in mind that according to paczynski ( 1967 ) @xmath43 and using the third kepler law relating the distance @xmath44 between the optical and x - ray counterparts of the binary , the masses ( @xmath15 and @xmath45 ) and the rotational period of the binary @xmath46 @xmath47^{1/3}\\ ] ] we find @xmath48 for periods of the binary @xmath49 measured in units of three hours and masses of the x - ray source @xmath50 measured in the solar units , we have the following size of the disk @xmath51 and @xmath52    but in fact , fitting the uv data obtained from iue , howarth & wilson ( 1983 hereafter hw83 ) found that the size of the disk in hz her / her x-1 is approximately 1.5 times larger than that given by formula ( 12 ) .",
    "they gave @xmath53 cm instead of @xmath54 cm obtained from formula ( 12 ) for p=1.7 d and m=1.4 .",
    "thus an uncertainty of a factor 1.5 exists in the estimate of the disk size by formula ( 12 ) .    using ( 13 ) for the value of @xmath55 and @xmath33",
    ", we get the gdm frequency @xmath40 from ( 8) as @xmath56",
    "given the success of the bulk motion comptonization model [ titarchuk , mastichiadis & kylafis 1997 ; titarchuk & zannias 1998 ; shrader & titarchuk 1998 ; laurent & titarchuk 1999 ; borozdin et al .",
    "1999 ; hereafter bor99 ) in reproducing the high - soft state continuum , shrader & titarchuk ( 1999 , hereafter sht99 ) have investigated the potential predictive power of this model . from the spectral shape and normalization",
    ", one can calculate an effective disk radius and the mass - to - distance ratio @xmath57 .",
    "other quantities such as a black hole mass and mass - accretion rate can be determined if the distance or mass are known independently .",
    "this is dependent upon an additional factor , @xmath58 , the so called `` hardening factor '' which represents the ratio of color - to - effective temperature .",
    "if one can identify several `` calibrators '' , i.e. , sources for which distance and mass are well determined , the model can be applied to derive @xmath58 over the available dynamic range in luminosity .",
    "three such sources are 1 ) gro  j1655 - 40 , for which extensive analysis was presented in previous papers ( bor99 and sht99 ) , 2 ) lmc  x-1 for which the distance is well constrained , and 3 ) nova muscae 1991 , for which the binary parameters are reasonably constrained . in the latter",
    "two cases , the hardening factor , @xmath59 , was used which was previously derived from analysis of gro  j1655 - 40 ( bor99 ) . the temperature - flux curve presented in bor99 and",
    "sht99 provide a self - consistency test of this assumption .",
    "thus , using the energy spectra of the high - soft state only , one can get strong constraints on the bh masses . here",
    "we have verified this energy spectrum method using the global oscillation frequency model for lmc x-1 and gro j1655 sources and then we determine the bh mass for xte j1118 + 480 using the persistent qpo frequency @xmath0 hz discovered by independent groups in the different energy bands .",
    "_ lmc x-1 _    shrader & titarchuk ( 1999 ) have estimated the bh mass in lmc x-1 as @xmath60^{1/2}$ ] and they inferred that @xmath61 . using the mass @xmath62 , the period @xmath63 d found by hutchings et al .",
    "( 1983 ) and the estimate of @xmath35 and @xmath64 ( for high mass accretion rate ) , we find from formula ( 14 ) that @xmath65 hz .",
    "this value of @xmath40 is very close to the narrow @xmath66 hz qpo peak found by ebisawa et al .",
    "( 1989 ) with a harmonic seen in the 1 - 16 kev range .",
    "the agreement of @xmath40 with the observed frequency may be viewed as a confirmation of the correct mass estimate given by sht99 for this source .    _",
    "gro j1655 - 40 _",
    "remillard et al . ( 1999 ) have found the relatively stable frequency near 0.1 hz which appears in the high - soft state .",
    "the mass @xmath67 and the period @xmath68 d for this source is known from the observations by orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) . using these values in formula ( 14 ) and @xmath35 ( bor99 ) and @xmath64",
    "we find that @xmath69 hz which is comparable with the observable value of @xmath70 hz .",
    "_ xte j1118 + 480 _    the source xte j1118 + 480 is presumably a black hole candidate ( revnivtsev , sunyaev & borozdin 2000 ) .",
    "the source is observed in the low hard state during the rising phase of the 2000 april outburst ( hynes et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this source ,",
    "almost three identical qpo frequencies were detected in optical ( 0.1 hz ) , ultraviolet ( 0.08 hz ) by hst ( haswell et al . 2000 ) and in x - ray energy ranges ( 0.08 hz ) by rxte ( revnivtsev et al . 2000 ) and ( 0.11 hz ) by asca ( yamaoka , ueda & dotani 2000 ) .",
    "the stability and independence of this frequency on the photon energy is a necessary feature of the gmd when the disk oscillates as a whole body .",
    "we do not exclude that these oscillations of outer part of disk may be amplified by the resonance effect due to reprocessing of x - ray flux oscillating with the same frequency .",
    "in fact , a preliminary analysis by haswell et al .",
    "( 2000 ) indicates that ultraviolet variability lags are behind x - ray by 1 - 2 s. this is likely due to the x - ray reprocessing in the disk .",
    "the energy spectrum of xte j1118 + 480 is a typical thermal comptonization spectrum ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) with the best - fit parameters optical depth @xmath71 and @xmath72 kev .",
    "recently wood et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have demonstrated from extensive observations of xte j1118 + 480 using the unconventional stellar aspect ( usa ) experiment and rxte that the qpo shows an upward drift from 0.07 hz to 0.15 hz while the source intensity slowly rises and then decreases .",
    "we can interpret this behaviour behavior of the qpo frequency by a significant change of the disk size @xmath73 during the spectral evolution of the source .",
    "the spectral evolution is related to the change of the mass accretion rate in the disk ( chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 ) which in turn causes the change of the disk size .",
    "soria ( 2000 , private communication ) argues that such a change is seen in gro j1655 - 40 . in other words ,",
    "when the disk mass accretion rate drops the spectrum gets harder and the qpo frequency increases ( see eq .",
    "8) because the size of the disk ( @xmath73 ) decreases .",
    "if our interpretation is correct we expect _ that the qpo frequency correlates with the spectral hardness _ but not with the source flux .",
    "following sht99 we suggest that in the low - hard state the inner disk edge retreats approximately at 17 shwarszchild radii due to evaporation of the innermost part . from formula",
    "( 16 ) we infer the bh mass in xte j1118 + 480 to be 20 solar masses with an accuracy 10% taking observed 0.1 hz as the gdm frequency , @xmath74 ( sht99 ) , @xmath75 h ( uemura et al . 2000 ) and @xmath76 .",
    "this mass is comparable that sht99 have found in lmc x-1 and nova muscae .",
    "_ her x-1 _    averintsev , titarchuk & sheffer ( 1992 ) made a numerical simulation of the process of occultation of the x - ray emission region on the neutron star surface and compared their results with the observed x - ray emission of her x-1 .",
    "they demonstrated constraints for a number of geometrical parameters of the hz her / her x-1 system ; in particular , they found the position of the inner edge of accretion disk at @xmath77 . taking @xmath78 , @xmath79 cm ( hw83 ) , @xmath80 d ( deeter et al . 1991 ) , @xmath81 and @xmath36 we find from ( 14 ) that @xmath82 hz which is close to the qpo frequency @xmath83 hz obtained by boroson et al.(2000 ) by analyzing the power density spectrum of hst uv data .",
    "the low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) sources 4u 1323 - 62 , exo 0748 - 676 and 4u 1746 - 37 exhibit qpos frequencies of about 1 hz ( see references in introduction ) .",
    "it was noted by jonker , van der klis & wijnands ( 1999 ) that a medium modulating the radiation from a central source is a promising explanation .",
    "here we put forward the idea that the oscillations of x - ray radiation with the low frequency can be a result of the gdm modulation of the x - ray radiation from a central source .",
    "the frequency of gdm is expected to be very stable because it mostly depends on the intrinsic characteristics of the system such as a mass and a rotation period ( or the disk size ) .",
    "these characteristics are comparable for the three aforementioned ns sources .",
    "the periods are 2.93 , 3.82 , 5.7 hours for 4u 1323 - 62 , exo 0748 - 676 and 4u 1746 - 37 respectively ( van paradijs 1995 ) .",
    "to estimate @xmath40 we take @xmath35 ( to99 ) and @xmath81 which is a typical value of the ns mass .",
    "the dependence of @xmath40 on the period according to formula ( 14 ) is not strong , @xmath84 , which means almost the same value of @xmath40 for each of the sources within uncertainties caused by assumptions regarding the disk size and the adjustment radius .",
    "the stability of @xmath40 can exist until the inner part of the disk is disrupted or just moved to the larger radii . in principle magnetic force and radiation pressure can modify the restoring force of the gdm .",
    "the related effects are amendable and they will be taken into account at later time .      in this _",
    "letter _ we have presented a model of the global disk oscillation mode . our analysis shows that the frequencies of this mode of 0.01 - 1 hz are closely related to the large ratio of sizes ( @xmath85 ) of the disk and its inner portion .",
    "this ratio reduces the characteristic khz keplerian frequency of the inner part of the disk by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude . _",
    "the gdm is a vertical mode and thus it should be often seen from the systems with the high inclination angle_. however due to x - ray reprocessing in the outer part of the disk and twisting of the disk there is also a chance of detecting these qpos from systems with small inclination angles .",
    "the gdm frequency is expected to be also _ independent of the photon energy and should be seen in all energy bands _ that the disk emits .",
    "the particular part of the viscous disk is presumably seen in the specific energy range because the effective temperature of disk @xmath86 is a function of radius @xmath87 , namely @xmath88 . this _ letter _ offers a new method of bh mass determination based on the persistent low qpo frequency measurement ; it supplements the x - ray energy spectrum method and the dynamical optical method of mass function determination .",
    "this new approach in our view is very promising and it allows an independent verification of bh mass obtained by other methods ."
