    "galactic cosmic rays ( crs ) have an energy spectrum showing characteristic features @xcite .",
    "in particular their astroparticle nature ( electrical charge , mass or the ratio of them ) has been pointed out as one of the key issues when trying to understand the souces where they may originate @xcite and the emission processes itself . additionally , this nature must determine , in turn , the mechanisms and feasibility to be accelerated to the high energies reported @xmath0 ev . in this line",
    "there are some puzzling experimental measurements that are not yet fully understood .",
    "for example , several experiments have reported strong anisotropy measurements in the arrival direction distributions of galactic crs in the tev to pev energy range ( super - kamiokande , tibet iii , milagro , argo - ybj , and icecube @xcite ) .",
    "the data reveal the presence of large scale anisotropies of amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "smaller scale anisotropies of size @xmath2 are also detected with amplitude a factor of a few lower .",
    "milagro has reported the detection at significance @xmath3 of two _ hotspots _ ( regions with enhanced cr intensity ) with amplitude @xmath4 , at a median energy of @xmath5tev .",
    "argo - ybj report similar excesses .",
    "icecube observes localized regions of angular scale @xmath6 of excess and deficit in cr flux with significance @xmath7 around a median energy of 20tev  @xcite .",
    "the large scale anisotropy could be naturally explained by the diffusive transport of crs within the galactic magnetic fields @xcite . due to",
    "the charged nature of crs at energies in tev - pev range their propagation is described by a gyroradius ( larmor radius ) given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the charge of the particle in units of the electron charge @xmath10 and the magnetic field strength of the galaxy is assumed to be @xmath11 g ( see @xcite for a review ) . for particles with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the coherence length of the galactic magnetic field ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the propagation will be totally diffusive over a distance @xmath14 .",
    "a number of previous works @xcite have attempted to explain these phenomena invoking several mechanisms , however the situation remains largely uncertain .    in this contribution based in @xcite",
    "we develop the possibility that the measured hotspots in the skymap are a manifestation of the peculiar nature of crs .",
    "we propose that quark matter lumps , so - called _ strangelets _ or _ nuclearites _ , could be produced in the mass ejection process taking place in the nuclear deconfinement transition of a regular neutron star ( ns ) to a quark star ( qs ) .",
    "this possibility has been proposed long ago @xcite @xcite and revisited in later works @xcite @xcite .",
    "recently , new ideas concerning the triggering due to presence of a internal energy release from a dark matter component in a sort of _ trojan horse mechanism _ have been considered @xcite@xcite .",
    "additional sources for these droplets may arise from high - density environments of merger events @xcite @xcite .",
    "these slightly positively charged lumps of quark matter may suffer a diffusive trajectory and if molecular clouds ( mc ) are near the sources this may drive the anisotropy .",
    "possible processes in the cloud include electron capture , decay or even spallation @xcite . in this way ,",
    "for example , a change in the droplet incident state of charge , as a consequence of the interaction with the mc may neutralize the lump or it could decay with some fragments likely to be neutralized in the cloud .",
    "these lumps would be formed after the metastable @xmath15 matter decays by weak interaction , @xmath16 , to form more stable @xmath17 matter @xcite @xcite .",
    "they are expected to be highly bound @xmath18 .",
    "typical values of strangelet binding energy are currently uncertain but supposed to be @xmath19 energies . either on earth ( accelerators ) or on the iss ( with the ams-02 spectrometer )",
    "direct searches are being conducted to experimentally detect this ( so far ) elusive type of astroparticles .",
    "the lowest energy state in a strangelet is not subject to the constraint of being neutral , and therefore it is energetically allowed to have stable @xmath20 , @xmath21 massive strangelets @xcite , where @xmath22 is the baryonic number .",
    "there is , however , a constraint on the minimum value of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "several models of strangelets exist that lead to various @xmath24 dependencies .",
    "for example , for ordinary strangelets , @xmath25 , while for cfl ( color - flavour - locked ) strangelets @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "even smaller charge - to - mass ratios are allowed @xmath27 .",
    "regarding charge , experiments such as cream and ams-02 will have the ability to perform a direct measurement , and infer estimates of @xmath24 @xcite with the rich instrument .",
    "if strangelets were responsible for the observed hotspots , they should produce detectable air - showers .",
    "there is a general belief that these should manifest as slowly moving droplets providing an enhanced photon production as they cross the water based telescopes @xcite . in turn",
    ", this is possible if the kinetic energy per nucleon content , @xmath28 , satisfies @xmath29gev .",
    "measurements indicate a total kinetic energy of particles in hotspots , @xmath30tev - pev , which implies @xmath31 .",
    "[ fig : rl ] represents the droplet larmor radius as a function of the baryonic number @xmath22 for strangelets with @xmath32 and kinetic energy contours @xmath33 ev .",
    "typically a diffusive behaviour is expected , since it is required that @xmath34 .",
    "if , instead , charge could be fractionary then quasi - rectilinear regimes would be possible .",
    "neutron stars have been suggested as possible sources of injection of strangelets @xcite .",
    "strangelets could be produced for instance in the course of a ns to qs transition @xcite . in such events",
    ", a fraction @xmath35 of the gravitational energy released can be injected into the expelled outer crust , leading to total kinetic energies @xmath36 erg for standard ns mass and radius .",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath37 of the ejected mass can be of order @xmath38 for ns mass @xmath39 , radius @xmath40 , and ejected mass @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "particles of mass number @xmath22 could then gain energies of order @xmath42 , the typical energy observed in hotspots .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that typical ejection fractions depend on the characteristics of the transition and , in particular , this may generate a multi - wavelength signal to help discriminate this catastrophic astrophysical event . a short hard @xmath43 kev spike in gamma rays",
    "is predicted to appear .     in a ns transition versus ejected outer crust",

    "time and peak energy , isotropic equivalent gamma - ray energy observability limits are shown in magenta , green and black respectively .",
    "astrophysical radii constraints are depicted in red .",
    "accelerated strangelets may experience energy losses by interacting with the radiation field close to the ns , and with the baryonic and radiative backgrounds of the supernova ( sn ) envelope .",
    "@xcite concluded that there is room for the escape of accelerated particles .",
    "besides , if the ejection happens when there are no sn envelope ( since the ns may have traveled far after the initial birth ) in a transition of a ns to a qs then ejection may be more efficient .",
    "charged strangelets will have a diffusive trajectory due to the magnetized interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "typical timescales are @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the rectilinear distance to the source and the diffusion coefficient is @xmath54^{1/3}$]@xmath55s@xmath56 , with @xmath57 the height of the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "the ionization and the spallation timescales in the ism ( of average density @xmath58 ) read respectively @xmath59yr , and @xmath60yr @xcite , implying that spallation should affect particles only mildly during their flight from sources located within 1kpc .",
    "let us consider that in our proposed model @xcite @xcite ns transitions are more likely to happen in old objects where dark matter accretion may have sufficient time to drive the conversion .    in the mc",
    "the typical radius in the galaxy is @xmath61pc , and their average density @xmath62 .",
    "cores are the inner more dense regions @xmath63 pc where @xmath64 and fields @xmath65 . in mc",
    "the spallation fraction can exceed unity , reaching @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 , with @xmath68 the diffusion time of strangelets in the cloud .",
    "the electron capture rate for strangelets in clouds with free electron density @xmath69 ( with @xmath70 ) is of order @xmath71 .",
    "as strangelets are predicted to be more bound than standard nuclei , these estimates can be viewed as upper limits for spallation .",
    "let us note that for a large @xmath24 lump of quark matter z may be large and the amount of ionization may not be negligible causing scintillation effects @xcite .",
    "additionally , for electron capture , it is possible that the large size of strangelets dominates the effects of the charge , implying a scaling in @xmath72 , and the rates quoted here can be viewed as a lower limit .",
    "one could expect that a fraction of strangelets undergoing electron capture ( similar to that quoted for regular ions @xcite ) or even spallation may generate charge _",
    "neutral _ secondaries .",
    "although most of the strangeness carrying lumps of quark matter is charged the work of @xcite suggests that a tiny parameter space exists where spallation could lead to bound neutral strangelets .",
    "neutral strangelets could then propagate rectilinearly to the earth and produce a _ hotspot _ in the sky of the angular size of the mc , @xmath73 , with @xmath74 the distance of the mc to the observer .",
    "note that this corresponds roughly to the size of the observed hotspots .",
    "the excess signal in a solid angle @xmath75 around one source can be defined as the following signal - to - noise ratio : @xmath76 , where @xmath77 indicates the number of events expected in a solid angle @xmath75 from a source and @xmath78 the corresponding number of events expected for an isotropic background . for a mc located at",
    "coordinates @xmath79 , at distance @xmath74 , and separated by @xmath80 from the source , the signal at energy @xmath81 can then be estimated as : @xmath82^{-1}\\frac{e_{\\rm ej}}{\\delta t}\\frac{a(\\alpha ,",
    "\\delta)^{1/2}}{4\\pi d_{\\rm mc}^2\\omega j_{\\rm iso , sr}^{1/2}}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath83 [ in m@xmath84  s  sr ] is the exposure of an experiment in the direction @xmath79 , @xmath85 is the observed cosmic ray flux at energy @xmath81 , per steradian , and @xmath86 is the diffusion time for particles to travel over a distance @xmath87 .",
    "the factor @xmath88 accounts for strangelet production rate at the source , and the neutralization rate in the mc .    for a source located inside the mc ,",
    "the luminosity in neutral strangelets radiated by the mc at @xmath89tev is of order @xmath90 .",
    "cosmic ray measurements indicate @xmath91ev@xmath56  s@xmath56  m@xmath92 sr@xmath56 , and we chose an exposure of @xmath93m@xmath94ssr , roughly corresponding to the milagro exposure at @xmath95tev , over 7 years of operation .",
    "( eq .  [ eq : sigma ] ) , as would be observed by milagro with 7 years of data , at @xmath89tev , as a function of the distance of the mc to the earth , @xmath74 , and the distance between the source and the mc , @xmath80 from @xcite . ]    in our calculation , we consider a production rate @xmath96 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : grbnsqs ] ) while the neutralization must be related to the degree of ionization present in the mc .",
    "typically @xmath97 and since diffusion times in this regime are @xmath98 , then @xmath99 .",
    "this leads to an efficiency factor @xmath100 .",
    "we find that efficiencies in the range of @xmath101 lead to reasonable values in terms of @xmath102 whatever the relative location of the source and the mc , and the distance to the mc . from eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma ] , one can infer the strong dependency of @xmath102 on the distance between the source and the mc : @xmath103 , when the source is at the border of the mc .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] depicts a case for strangelets with @xmath104 , @xmath105 and a mc of radius @xmath106pc and a source of luminosity @xmath107erg / s with an efficiency factor @xmath108 .",
    "the value of @xmath102 is relatively constant as long as the source is at a relatively central position inside the mc .",
    "this range of @xmath109 thus implies that only mc within @xmath110kpc , and only sources _ located inside the mc _ can produce a significant hotspot ( note also that local mcs are found beyond @xmath111pc ) .",
    "most observed hotspots could be produced by mcs in the gould belt ( a star forming region concentrating many mcs , that forms a ring at a distance from the sun of @xmath112kpc ) , at the location where ns - qs transitions may have occurred .",
