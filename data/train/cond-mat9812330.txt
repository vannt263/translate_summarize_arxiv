    "there is a great deal of current interest in quasi one - dimensional quantum spin models , such as spin ladders , spin chains with dimerization and ( or ) frustration , and various generalizations of the above .",
    "the studies of these models have been mostly triggered by the experimental discoveries of several spin - peierls and spin - ladder compounds @xcite .",
    "the theoretical efforts have been focused mainly on the nature of the ground state , the excitation spectrum , as well as thermodynamic properties of these models .",
    "the system of coupled quantum @xmath0 chains ( spin - ladder ) was found to behave differently depending on whether the number of chains is even or odd @xcite .",
    "for an even number , the excitation spectrum is generically gaped and short - range correlations dominate in the ground state . the single @xmath0 quantum spin chain with dimerization exhibits",
    "quite similar properties , since it is known that dimerization produces an energy gap and destroys the quasi long - range order of the integrable uniform chain .    in a recent paper , ref.@xcite , m.a .",
    "martin - delgado , r. shankar , and g. sierra have proposed a model of coupled spin chains with staggered dimerization which possesses a rich phase diagram , quite different from that of the simple spin ladder ( no dimerization ) .",
    "consider the simplest version of the model , containing two coupled @xmath0 heisenberg chains ( fig . 1 . ) :    @xmath1{\\bf s}_{\\alpha , i}\\cdot { \\bf s}_{\\alpha , i+1}\\ ] ]    here @xmath2 is labeling the two chains ( legs of the ladder ) .",
    "the coupling @xmath3 is the inter - chain ( rung ) interaction and @xmath4 are the nearest neighbor interactions along the chains ( all couplings are antiferromagnetic ) .",
    "notice that the dimerization @xmath5 is staggered in both directions ( along and perpendicular to the chains ) , i.e. the dimerization in each chain is in antiphase with its neighbor chain .",
    "the model eq.(1 ) was analyzed in ref.@xcite by mapping onto a non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) . in the nlsm approach the value of the topological angle",
    "@xmath6 determines the nature of the possible phases of the model @xcite . for @xmath7",
    "the model is massive while it is massless for @xmath8 . for the model at hand two",
    "massive ( gaped ) phases were found in the parameter plane @xmath9 with a massless ( critical ) line separating them , determined by the equation :    @xmath10    a symmetric branch with @xmath11 also exists but we will assume @xmath12 from now on .",
    "the two massive phases separated by this line are basically phases where the dominant correlations are along the rungs or the stronger bonds along the legs .",
    "the existence of a critical line is quite unusual since individually both interactions , @xmath13 and @xmath5 are gap producing .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "1 . that there are two points @xmath14 and @xmath15 where the system is a single uniform chain and hence integrable and massless .",
    "the nlsm approach eq.(2 ) does not correctly reproduce the point @xmath16 which is quite natural since it is expected to work in the vicinity of the point @xmath15 only .",
    "it has been conjectured in ref.@xcite essentially from continuity , that a critical line connects the two integrable points .",
    "let us mention that upon introducing an additional spin alternation @xcite and ( or ) considering ladders of spin @xmath17 or higher @xcite the phase diagram of the system will be even more complex .",
    "the basic origin for this complexity however is still the staggered dimerization in the rung direction .",
    "thus , form now on we will consider only the  minimal \" model eq.(1 ) .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to analyze the excitation spectrum and the phase diagram of the model eq.(1 ) at @xmath18 by a combination of numerical and analytical techniques . in sec .",
    "ii we present exact diagonalization results for the energy gap and the spin - spin correlations , confirming the existence of two gaped phases separated by a gapless line . in sec .",
    "iii we develop two kinds of strong - coupling approaches in the phase dominated by strong interchain ( rung ) correlations : ( a ) dimer series expansions , and ( b ) diagrammatic treatment of the effective hamiltonian , written in terms of bond triplet operators .",
    "the spectrum near the critical line is calculated and the relevant interactions , responsible for the closing of the gap are identified .",
    "iv contains our conclusions and discussion of future prospects .",
    "first we present results from finite lattice diagonalizations of the hamiltonian eq.(1 ) , for systems of up to @xmath19 spins .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used throughout . for reasons of symmetry the number of spins must be a multiple of @xmath20 , and most results are obtained from extrapolation of @xmath21 spin systems .",
    "we find empirically that the ground state is a singlet @xmath22 whereas the first excited state is a triplet @xmath23 .",
    "the computed singlet - triplet gaps are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit @xmath24 via the ansatz :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constants .",
    "the last term allows for the logarithmic corrections arising through conformal invariance in spin chains and effectively accounts for the residual curvature observed in direct ratio plots .    in fig .",
    "we show the variation of energy gaps versus the interchain coupling @xmath28 for various @xmath29 , for a fixed value of the dimerization @xmath5 ( in this case @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is clear qualitatively that the variation in @xmath31 is small for both small and large values of @xmath28 whereas the variation is large near @xmath32 where the individual curves have a minimum .",
    "the dashed lines , based on the extrapolated formula ( 3 ) clearly show the gap vanishing at a single point on the @xmath28 axis .",
    "similar results are obtained for other values of @xmath5 although for small @xmath5 the convergence is poorer .",
    "this is consistent with the increasing quantum fluctuations and larger finite size corrections expected near the uniform limit .",
    "this analysis leads to fig .",
    "3 . which shows the estimated critical line in the @xmath33 plane . comparing with eq.(2 ) one can see that the nlsm result can not be trusted numerically , but the existence of a gapless line is correctly predicted .    in fig .",
    "we show various spin correlations versus @xmath28 for @xmath30 .",
    "as intuitively expected the phase with @xmath34 is characterized by strong inter - chain ( rung ) and weak intra - chain correlations .",
    "when @xmath28 decreases and ultimately crosses the critical point , the behavior of the correlation functions is reversed , signaling a transition into a phase , dominated by strong intra - chain correlations on the stronger bonds .",
    "we find that the spin correlations as well as the excitation gap change continuously through the quantum transition point .",
    "in this section we present analysis based on strong - coupling expansions around the limit @xmath35 .",
    "two approaches are used : the dimer series expansion and the bond operator mapping onto an effective interacting bose gas .",
    "the two approaches are similar in spirit and produce quite similar result even though the technical details are different .",
    "we start with results obtained by the linked - cluster dimer series expansion method .",
    "the linked - cluster expansion method has been previously reviewed in several articles@xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "the basic idea is to divide the hamiltonian into two parts : @xmath36 where @xmath37{\\bf s}_{\\alpha , i}\\cdot { \\bf s}_{\\alpha , i+1 } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by fixing values of @xmath5 , we can construct an expansion in @xmath38 by taking @xmath39 as unperturbed hamiltonian and @xmath40 as a perturbation .",
    "the zeroth order @xmath41 approximation corresponds to isolated dimers ( singlets ) on the rungs .",
    "each singlet can be excited into a triplet state and thus the excitation gap is @xmath13 .",
    "finite @xmath42 introduces interactions between the rungs which modifies substantially the spectrum . in order to consider",
    "the physically interesting coupling region @xmath43 the perturbation series has to be developed to high order and then extrapolated to the relevant point .",
    "we have carried out an expansion up to order @xmath44 for the ground state energy , to order @xmath45 for antiferromagnetic susceptibility , and to order @xmath46 for the triplet excitation spectra for several values of @xmath5 .",
    "there are only 12 graphs that contribute to the ground state energy and dispersion , and 14 graphs that contribute to the antiferromagnetic susceptibility .",
    "the series coefficients are not presented here , but are available upon request .",
    "then we have used integrated differential approximants and pad approximants@xcite to extrapolate the series .",
    "it is sometimes useful to compare the present results with the spectrum of a spin ladder without dimerization @xmath47 , which can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig .",
    "4 . ) .    in fig . 5 .",
    "we present the triplet excitation spectrum @xmath48 for @xmath30 , obtained by the dimer series expansions .",
    "the triplet gap @xmath49 decreases with the decrease of @xmath28 , vanishing ( within error bar ) at the critical value @xmath50 . by comparing the spectra of fig .",
    "5 . with the corresponding spectra for @xmath51 ( see fig .",
    "4 . of ref.@xcite for the value @xmath52 )",
    "one can see that the renormalization due to finite @xmath5 is the strongest at @xmath53 while in the vicinity of the point @xmath54 the energy is almost unrenormalized .",
    "this is due to the fact that the first three leading orders in @xmath38 do not change @xmath55 ( see also sec .",
    "iii.b ) .",
    "a more accurate determination of the critical line can be achieved by the dlog pad approximants to the antiferromagnetic susceptibility series , and the results are presented in fig .",
    "the phase boundary obtained within the dimer series approach is in excellent agreement with the exact diagonalization results in the region @xmath56 . for small values of @xmath13",
    "the convergence of the dimer series becomes poorer ( larger error bars ) , as the critical point occurs at much larger @xmath38 . in fig .",
    "several critical spectra , for parameters on the massless line , are plotted .",
    "notice that for @xmath57 when eq.(1 ) reduces to a  snake \" , i.e. one - dimensional heisenberg chain , the dimer series reproduces correctly the spinon dispersion , which is known from the exact bethe ansatz solution of the problem @xcite .",
    "the latter is given by the formula ( for a chain with exchange @xmath42 ) : @xmath58 .",
    "indeed , the lower curve in fig . 6 . practically coincides with this formula .    using the long series for the ground state energy , we were able to obtain the most accurate estimates of the ground state energy , as it was done before for the normal two - chain ladder@xcite .",
    "for example for @xmath59 and @xmath60 which is near the critical line , the ground - state energy per site is estimated to be @xmath61    beside the above inter - chain dimer expansions about the limit @xmath35 , we can also construct another dimer expansion , the intra - chain dimer expansion , by taking the stronger intra - chain bonds ( the bonds couping @xmath62 ) as unperturbed hamiltonian , and the rest of the bonds as perturbation , and carry out dimer series expansions in @xmath63 for fixed values of @xmath64 .",
    "the series have been computed up to order @xmath65^{11}$ ] for the ground state energy , to order @xmath65^{6}$ ] for the antiferromagnetic susceptibility , and to order @xmath65^{7}$ ] for the triplet excitation spectra for several values of @xmath64 . with this expansion , one can study the excitation spectrum and the ground state properties for the parameters located within the intra - chain dimer phase .",
    "the gapless critical line derived from this expansion agrees well with that by inter - chain dimer expansions , but with much less accuracy .",
    "here we will not present any detailed results from this dimer expansion , however the series are available upon request .      in this section",
    "we describe a mapping of the model onto an interacting bose gas , which can be achieved by using the bond operator representation for spins @xcite .",
    "denote by @xmath66 the singlet state formed by two spins on rung @xmath67 .",
    "then , in the strong - coupling limit @xmath68 the excitations are well described by triplets , created by the ( bond ) operators @xmath69 , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 are the three components of the triplet and the usual bosonic commutation relations hold @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian eq.(1 ) expressed in terms of the triplet operators is @xcite :    @xmath72    where we have separated the part due to dimerization : @xmath73 + [ i \\leftrightarrow i+1 ] \\right \\}\\ ] ] and @xmath74 will be defined below . for @xmath51 the hamiltonian ( 7 )",
    "coincides with that of the simple two - leg ladder @xcite . in order for the triplet operators to represent only the physical spin triplet states",
    ", they have to satisfy the on - site hard - core constraint : @xmath75 .",
    "this restriction on the hilbert space can be taken into account by introducing an infinite on - site repulsion between the triplets , as discussed in our previous work @xcite :    @xmath76    our goal is to develop a diagrammatic treatment of the interactions in the hamiltonian ( 7 ) in order to understand which terms are most relevant to the renormalization of the spectrum .",
    "the quadratic part ( first line in eq.(7 ) ) is diagonalized in momentum space by a bogoliubov transformation @xmath77 , which leads to the spectrum @xmath78 , with @xmath79 .",
    "the bogoliubov coefficients are defined as : @xmath80 .",
    "the spectrum of the hamiltonian eq.(7 ) without the dimerization term @xmath81 was investigated diagrammatically in refs.@xcite .",
    "here we only summarize the results .",
    "the on - site repulsion @xmath74 gives the dominant contribution to the spectrum renormalization , while the two - particle inter - site interaction with strength @xmath82 ( first term in the second line of eq.(7 ) ) is a relatively minor effect @xcite . even though the on - site interaction is infinite , the scattering amplitude @xmath83 is finite ( as physically expected ) , which can be seen by resumming the ladder series , shown in fig .",
    "7(a ) and setting @xmath84 .",
    "the scaterring amplitude and the corresponding self - energy ( fig .",
    "7(b ) ) are @xcite :    @xmath85^{-1 } = \\sum_{q}\\frac{1}{-\\omega + \\omega_{q}+ \\omega_{k - q } } \\ , \\",
    "\\sigma_{u}(k,\\omega ) = 4 \\sum_{q } v_{q}^{2 } \\gamma(k + q,\\omega - \\omega_{k}).\\ ] ]    here , and in all future equations we set , for convenience , the number of rungs to unity . as emphasized in ref.@xcite , eq.(10 ) represents the dominant contribution from @xmath74 , provided the density of triplets @xmath86 is small .",
    "thus eq.(10 ) should be viewed as the first term in an expansion in powers of @xmath87 . for the simple ladder ( @xmath51 )",
    "we find ( after solving the corresponding dyson equation , see below ) @xmath88 for @xmath89 , and @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "therefore the dilute gas approximation is expected to work quite well even for @xmath43 .",
    "naturally when @xmath92 the above picture , based on strong rungs , breaks down . instead , the excitations in this regime should be viewed as weakly bound spinons , thus making the local triplets an inadequate staring point .",
    "we have estimated that the bond operator formalism describes well the excitation spectrum for @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "next we turn to the three - particle term @xmath81 which represents the dimerization part of the hamiltonian .",
    "to lowest ( one - loop ) order there are contributions to the normal and anomalous self - energies , drawn in fig .",
    "7(c ) and fig .",
    "7(d ) , respectively .",
    "the corresponding formulas are :    @xmath93^{2}}{\\omega - \\omega_{q+\\pi } -   \\omega_{k - q } } + \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{c } u \\leftrightarrow v \\\\",
    "\\omega \\rightarrow -\\omega \\end{array } \\right\\},\\ ] ]    @xmath94    where the following definitions are used",
    "@xmath95    @xmath96    the function @xmath97 originates from the fourier transform of the three - particle vertex eq.(8 ) .",
    "equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) can be derived by evaluating all possible internal loops in the diagrams in figs .",
    "7(c),(d ) ,",
    "where , as usual , lines with a single arrow stand for the normal green s function @xmath98 and lines with double arrows represent the anomalous green s functions @xmath99 .",
    "finally , the coupled dyson s equations for the normal and anomalous green s functions have to be solved leading to the result ( more details can be found in @xcite ) :    @xmath100 [ \\omega -   a_{k } - \\sigma^{n}(k,\\omega ) ] +   [ b_{k } + \\sigma^{a}(k,\\omega)]^{2}},\\ ] ]    where the total normal and anomalous self - energies are defined as @xmath101    in order to get a feeling for the effect of @xmath81 on the spectrum , it is instructive to examine the second order perturbation theory result .",
    "it can be obtained by noticing that to leading order @xmath102 .",
    "thus in evaluating the leading order correction arising from the dimerization term one can set @xmath103 which means that only the normal self - energy contributes : @xmath104 one can see that to lowest order the renormalization of the spectrum for @xmath53 is the strongest while @xmath54 is not renormalized . for a fixed value of @xmath5 ,",
    "the gap @xmath105 decreases with decreasing @xmath28 and vanishes at a critical ratio , signaling an instability of the rung dimer phase .",
    "we have found the spectrum numerically by solving for the poles of the exact green s function eq.(15 ) , thus resumming the perturbation series to all orders .",
    "the results for @xmath30 are presented in fig .",
    "5 . the diagrammatic results are in good agreement with the dimer series expansions , however with decreasing @xmath28 the disagreement increases .",
    "we would like to point out that even though the two methods have the same starting point ( strong rungs ) and typically agree quite well in the region of strong coupling , for smaller coupling the dimer series expansion performs better .",
    "the reason is that the series expansion takes into account all terms to a particular ( finite ) order , while the diagrammatic approach sums up only the most dominant subclass of diagrams .",
    "the small parameter @xmath87 controlling the diagrammatic expansion grows with decreasing @xmath28 and at @xmath106 ( the critical point , as estimated by the dimer series and exact diagonalization ) has the value @xmath107 .",
    "this relatively large value of the triplet density is related to the considerably decreased magnitude of the spin - spin correlation function on the rungs@xcite ( see the ( 1,2 ) correlations in fig .",
    "therefore the agreement between the diagrammatic analysis and the dimer series is , in fact , even better than expected .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the excitation spectrum and the ground state phase diagram of the quantum spin ladder with staggered dimerization and have found that a transition takes place form a phase dominated by strong rung correlations into a phase , characterized by intrachain dimers .",
    "the two phases are separated by a gapless line .",
    "the location of the boundary , the triplet excitations , as well as the spin - spin correlations in the rung dimer phase were calculated by dimer series expansions , diagrammatic analysis of the effective hard - core bose gas of rung triplets , and exact diagonalizations .",
    "we have identified the three - particle scattering @xmath81 , in terms of the rung triplets , to be responsible for the instability of the rung dimer phase ( closing of the gap ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is indeed the term which , in the continuous field theory formulation , contributes to the topological angle @xmath6 and leads to the transition .",
    "indeed , from the representation of the spin operator on a given rung @xmath67 in terms of the triplets @xcite one can easily see that @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "these are precisely the two vector fields used in the derivation of the non - linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "therefore the terms of the form @xmath110 which appear in our lattice hamiltonian @xmath81 would be precisely the ones which give a non - trivial @xmath6 after the continuum limit is taken .",
    "there are several additional aspects of the problem that can be addressed within the strong - coupling formalism described in this paper .",
    "as suggested in ref.@xcite the spinons become unconfined on the gapless line separating the two phases of the model ( see fig .",
    "3 . ) . since in the two massive phases confinement definitely takes place , we would expect that the triplet spectral weight decreases as the critical line is approached and ultimately goes to zero .",
    "in addition , at the point of deconfinement the same energy is required to create triplet and singlet excitations .",
    "therefore , close to the critical line , a low - energy singlet excitation must appear in the spectrum . within the strong - coupling approach",
    "a singlet can be viewed as a collective bound state of two triplets @xcite .",
    "while in the spin ladder without dimerization the singlet bound state is high in energy ( small binding energy ) , in the present model we expect it to become a truly low - energy state ( strong triplet binding ) .",
    "we leave these issues for a future study @xcite .",
    "while this manuscript was being prepared for publication we became aware of two recent preprints devoted to the same model @xcite .",
    "both of these works have studied the phase diagram numerically via exact diagonalization and their results for the location of the critical line are in agreement with ours .",
    "we would like to thank o.p .",
    "sushkov for numerous stimulating discussions and critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "this work was supported by a grant from the australian research council .",
