    "in @xcite b. ammann and c. br discussed the properties of the riemannian spin geometry of a smooth principal @xmath1-bundle , relating , under suitable hypotheses , the spin structure and the spinor dirac operator on the total space of the bundle to the spin structure and the dirac operator on the base space . a noncommutative generalization of these results was proposed and developed in @xcite by introducing a notion of projectability for @xmath1-equivariant @xcite real spectral triples @xcite over a noncommutative principal @xmath1-bundle and showing how it is possible to twist the dirac operator of a projectable spectral triple using a strong connection . moreover , a notion of compatibility between a connection and the dirac operator on the total space of the bundle was introduced . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "dirac operators on principal bundles with higher dimension structure groups have not been worked out yet . in this work",
    "we extend the study of @xmath1-bundles to the case of principal @xmath0-bundles ( @xmath2 ) , working from the beginning with spectral triples and on the noncommutative level .",
    "in particular we introduce certain twisted dirac operators , finding in this way a class of new dirac operators .",
    "we discuss as a particular case the commutative case , the noncommutative tori ( with the noncommutative 3-torus , seen as a principal @xmath3-bundle over the circle , as an explicit example ) , and theta deformed manifolds .",
    "in noncommutative geometry the algebra of functions ( of certain regularity ) over a topological space is replaced by a suitable noncommutative algebra . in an analogue fashion , a hopf algebra @xmath4",

    "let @xmath4 be a hopf algebra with invertible antipode @xmath5 and counit @xmath6 .",
    "then a right @xmath4-comodule algebra @xmath7 , with multiplication map @xmath8 and coaction @xmath9 , is called a _ principal @xmath4-comodule algebra _ if it admits a linear map @xmath10 such that :    ( i ) : :    @xmath11 , ( ii ) : :    @xmath12 , ( iii ) : :    @xmath13 , ( iv ) : :    @xmath14 ,    where @xmath15 is the switch @xmath16 .    we shall understand a principal @xmath4-comodule algebra @xmath7 as a quantum principal bundle over the coinvariant subalgebra @xmath17 of @xmath7 , and often denote it simply by the inclusion map @xmath18 . in particular one can prove that then @xmath7 is a _ hopf - galois extension _",

    "this is clearly fulfilled in the case at hand by @xmath39 given by the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath36 . in the following sections we shall assume however that all the relevant structures discussed on the algebraic level extend to suitable completions , e.g the coaction of @xmath4 on @xmath7 comes from the strongly continuous unitary action of @xmath40 .",
