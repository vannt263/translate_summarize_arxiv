    "the cell metabolism of microbacteria at extreme temperatures and dry environments is protected by the presence of compatible solutes which are also called osmolytes , co - solvents or extremolytes @xcite .",
    "it has been found that compatible solutes are strongly hygroscopic and prevent denaturation processes of the cell proteins by increasing the melting temperature @xcite .",
    "one important osmolyte which is often used in industrial products is hydroxyectoine @xcite . especially in the last years , several studies have been published to investigate the general function of osmolytes .",
    "most of the theories which aim to describe the stabilization mechanism accurately can be divided into direct and indirect interactions @xcite . in the context of extremolyte protein stabilization",
    ", we will briefly discuss in the following the most common ones .",
    "+ the framework of the preferential exclusion model as an indirect mechanism is established by the consideration of a protein dissolved in aqueous solution that contains compatible solutes @xcite . within this model",
    "it is assumed that the chemical potential of the water at the proteins surface is perturbed by the presence of the co - solute .",
    "the corresponding thermodynamic interactions @xcite lead to deviations from the bulk molar concentration of the co - solvent compared to the local environment around the protein .",
    "these deviations can be related to a preferential binding or a preferential exclusion of the co - solute .",
    "+ the dynamic exchange of extremolytes in the local surrounding of the proteins surface result in free energy differences due to exclusion .",
    "these differences are compensated by a significant increase of the water molecules in the local environment of the protein .",
    "preferential hydration and preferential exclusion are therefore synergetic effects which appear simultaneously . according to the original idea , the stabilizing effect on the protein",
    "is mainly caused by the excess solvent molecules whose interactions restrict the protein to its native state by increasing the melting temperature @xcite .",
    "a varying melting temperature as well as a strong influence on the water structure in presence of ectoine , trimethylamine - n - oxide , amino acids and sugars has been also observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition , the preferential exclusion model has been used to understand the effects of monolayer structure formation @xcite .",
    "+ molecular dynamics simulations have indicated @xcite that the preferential exclusion model is relevant for a specific class of proteins .",
    "it has been found that the co - solvents do not directly interact with the proteins surface in agreement to the theory , but slow down the diffusion of solvent molecules in the local environment of the protein @xcite .",
    "it has been concluded that this restriction is responsible for the change of the melting temperature and therefore the sustainment of the kinetic stability of the protein .",
    "this has been in particular investigated for the chymotrypsin inhibitor ii ( ci2 ) @xcite .",
    "other proteins like met - enkephalin show deviations to this model which result in the authors conclusion , that the preferential exclusion model is only relevant for proteins with well - defined and pronounced hydration shells @xcite .",
    "macromolecules which are less well - hydrated , _ e. g. _ met - enkephalin are only slightly influenced in their unfolding processes such that the melting temperature remains unchanged .",
    "+ a different mechanism in contrast to the preferential exclusion assumption is proposed by the transfer free energy model @xcite which relates the increased stability of the protein to a solvent quality decrease in presence of compatible solutes .",
    "this leads to favorable intra - molecular hydrogen bonds compared to unfavorable solvent - protein interactions . the excess of intramolecular hydrogen bonds results in an increased stability of the native structure which is validated by a shifting of the equilibrium constant to the folded state .",
    "+ in this paper we focus on the properties of ci2 and peo ( polyethylene oxide ) in presence of compatible solutes .",
    "our results indicate that preferential hydration is absent for these molecules although an increased stability of the native state can be observed . we have found that the free energy landscape is significantly changed in presence of hydroxyectoine such that unfolding becomes energetically less favorable .",
    "in addition we present numerical findings which validate that changes of the solvent properties are mainly responsible for the observed stabilization behavior .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in the next sections we introduce the theoretical background and the numerical details .",
    "the results are discussed in the fourth section .",

    "the end - to - end vector is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the position of the @xmath3-th and the first monomer .",
    "the end - to - end radius obeys a scaling behavior which is expressed by @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the excluded - volume parameter @xcite which is dependent on the solvent properties @xcite .",
    "hence a good solvent for the macromolecule results in a swollen conformation whereas a bad solvent leads to a shrinkage .",
    "+ a general way to calculate free energy differences for macromolecular conformations or solvation properties in computer simulations is thermodynamic integration @xcite . the differences can be computed by the coupling of the hamiltonian @xmath6 to a perturbation parameter @xmath7 which corresponds to a well - defined state @xcite .",
    "this parameter regulates the strength of the conservative interactions from fully developed to absence .",
    "the free energy difference between state a and state b is defined by @xmath8 where @xmath7 is in the parameter range from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",

    "at a first glance it can be seen that direct interactions of the co - solvent with the protein are nearly absent . for a more quantitative description",

    "it can be concluded that the results do not agree with the preferential exclusion @xcite due to identical values for the hydrogen bond densities as well as with the standard transfer free energy model @xcite due to the negligible differences in the number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds .",

    "this result is in agreement to a recent publication , which has reported the occurrence of direct binding between hydroxyectoine and lipid headgroups for high molar concentrations @xcite . nevertheless ,",
    "regarding the large number of hydroxyectoine molecules , it can be concluded that preferential binding of hydroxyectoine which has been found as important @xcite for zwitterionic co - solvents is a minor effect for protein stabilization .",
    "this becomes obvious by regarding the correlation coefficient between the end - to - end radius and the number of direct bonds with hydroxyectoine which is given by a negative value of @xmath49 .",
    "hence it can be concluded that the stabilization of a compact state in presence of hydroxyectoine is mainly caused by indirect solvent interactions .          to study the stabilization process in more detail , we have simulated a peo chain in aqueous solution for various hydroxyectoine concentrations .",
    "peo consists of polar and apolar atoms ( @xmath50 ) such that the stabilizing effects of co - solvents can be investigated by a chemically simple peo molecule instead of complex proteins . + we start this investigation by calculating the end - to - end radius @xmath0 for peo in absence of hydroxyectoine and for a concentration of 0.11 mol / l .",

    "values larger than 1 nm are energetically unfavorable in presence of the extremolyte .",

    "the linear dependence is obvious .",
    "direct interactions between the co - solvent and ectoine are absent .",

    "although the effects are small , the linear dependence of the concentration on the relaxation times as well as the averaging effect over all molecules emphasizes the relative influence of hydroxyectoine .",
    "it is obvious that the presence of a high molar concentration of hydroxyectoine is directly related to increased relaxation times .",
    "hence it can be concluded that the structural reorganization of water is diminished in presence of hydroxyectoine which validates the observed excess entropy values shown in fig .",
    "similar effects can be also observed in the context of hydrophobic hydration @xcite and the influence of disaccharides on water dynamics @xcite . +        the decrease in entropy is also supported by the results shown in fig .",

    "we have investigated the influence of compatible solutes on the structural properties of ci2 and peo . it has been found that in presence of hydroxyectoine the protein as well as the polymer show a significant preservation of the compact structure .",
    "energetic stabilization of compact states due to an increase of the free energy barriers has been observed by analyzing the results of metadynamics simulations .",
    "these findings are supported by an increase of the free solvation energy in presence of hydroxyectoine for polar ectoine molecules .",

    "we have indicated a significant increase of the excess free energy in combination with decreased excess entropy values .",
    "the observed entropy deficit can be validated by an increase of relaxational orientation times , increase of water hydrogen bond lifetimes as well as a decreased diffusivity .",
    "the free energy increase can be also related to a lower average number of hydrogen bonds between water molecules .",
    "+ by a combination of these observations , we propose the following mechanism which is responsible for the preservation of a proteins compact configuration .",
    "direct interactions between hydroxyectoine and the macromolecule can be neglected due to the absence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds . due to the increased values for the polar molecules free solvation energy , it can be assumed that a swelling of hydrophilic surface areas is less energetically favorable in presence of a highly concentrated solution of hydroxyectoine compared to a pure water solution .",
    "this becomes also obvious by the values for the hydrophilic / hydrophobic solvent accessible surface area for ci2 shown in tab .",
    "it is remarkable that the size of the hydrophobic area increases in presence of hydroxyectoine whereas the hydrophilic area decreases .",
    "+ as a direct consequence , apolar hydrophobic molecules have decreased energy values for large hydroxyectoine concentrations as it has been validated for ho - ch@xmath74-oh ( data not shown ) . +",
    "this effect is mainly responsible for the stabilization of the proteins compact state .",
    "it is widely accepted that protein folding to the compact state is initiated by a hydrophobic collapse @xcite where hydrophobic residues are shielded in the interior whereas polar residues stay in direct contact with the solvent @xcite .",
    "+ considering the reverse direction , unfolding is correlated with a swelling of the total solvent accessible surface area . in the presence of hydroxyectoine , an increase of the hydrophilic surface area is energetically unfavorable .",
    "compared to a pure solution , the compact native state is stabilized due to an increase of the free energy barriers such that swelling is suppressed . + it has to be noticed that the proposed mechanism is universal for all proteins with well - defined hydrophilic surface areas regardless of the chemical details .",
    "+ the deficits for the free solvation energy in presence of compatible solutes are in good agreement to experimental results @xcite and to the conclusions of the transfer free energy model @xcite which assumes a decrease of solvent quality for large co - solvent concentrations .",
    "hence the interaction of the macromolecules with the solvent becomes less favorable such that a shrinkage process due to solvophobic effects @xcite can be observed .",
    "detailed deviations from the transfer free energy model in our simulation are given by a negligible excess number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds to stabilize the proteins compact structure .",
    "+ our results validate that solvophobic effects are strong enough to stabilize the preservation of the compact native state as it can be also seen by the free energy landscapes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and as it has been proposed in ref .",
    "unfolding is energetically less preferable in presence of hydroxyectoine such that the equilibrium constant even at harsh conditions is shifted towards the native structure .",
    "these results are in good agreement to experimental findings @xcite .",
    "+ finally we are also able to explain the results of a recent publication @xcite , where it has been found that the melting temperature for met - enkephalin remains unchanged in presence of ectoine . by detailed analysis of met - enkephalin , it comes out that the the ratio of the hydrophobic surface area to the total solvent accessible surface area is larger compared to ci2 . due to the discussion above",
    ", we conclude that the stabilizing effects of the co - solvent on the hydrophilic regions are less important for met - enkephalin .",
    "in addition it has been also validated that a well - defined unfolding process for met - enkephalin is hard to observe due to low energy barriers between different conformations @xcite . + summarizing all results",
    ", we propose a simple mechanism in close agreement to the transfer free energy model to explain the stabilizing effect of extremolytes on the native state of proteins .",
    "our results imply that the solvophobic effect is the main driving force to shift the equilibrium constant to the native form in absence of direct intra- and intermolecular interactions .",
    "the strategy of extremolyte production in microbacteriae under environmental stress can be explained by the proposed mechanism which is validated by significant variations of the solvent properties .",
