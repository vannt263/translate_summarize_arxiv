    "galaxy groups are important tracers of the matter distribution in the universe , offering a powerful alternative to individual galaxies .",
    "part of the appeal of galaxy groups lies in the simplicity of their relation to the dark matter .",
    "theoretically , each dark matter halo yields a single group of galaxies .",
    "this is a clear advantage over the use of galaxies to trace mass , as the occupation of haloes by galaxies depends upon halo mass ( e.g. benson et al .",
    "2000 ; berlind et al .",
    "typical groups are less elitist than the richest clusters which only account for a few percent of the mass of the universe ( e.g. jenkins et al . 2001 ) . the measurement of the clustering amplitude of groups as a function of their mass is an important probe of hierarchical clustering ( governato et al .",
    "1999 ; colberg et al .",
    "2000 ; padilla & baugh 2002 ) .",
    "previous attempts to measure the clustering of groups have been hampered by the small size of the samples .",
    "for example , jing & zang ( 1988 ) measured the redshift space correlation function of a sample of 135 groups extracted from the cfa survey by geller & huchra ( 1983 ) . by the end of the 1990s , this situation had only improved slightly with an analysis of @xmath3 groups in the updated zwicky catalogue by merchn , maia & lambas ( 2000 ) . perhaps unsurprisingly , these early studies were inconclusive .",
    "one dispute concerned the relative strength of the auto - correlation function of groups and of galaxies .",
    "kashlinsky ( 1987 ) produced an analytic argument suggesting that a sample of groups corresponding to haloes less massive than a characteristic mass @xmath4 ( see section 2.3 for a definition of @xmath4 ) should display a weaker clustering signal than that of their constituent galaxies .",
    "similar conclusions can be reached from the calculation of the bias of dark matter haloes first carried out by cole & kaiser ( 1989 ) , and subsequently by mo & white ( 1996 ) and sheth , mo & tormen ( 2001 ) .",
    "however , the first results comparing the clustering of groups and galaxies both confirmed ( jing & zang 1988 ; maia & da costa 1990 ) and contradicted ( ramella , geller & huchra 1990 ; girardi , boschin & da costa 2000 ) this theoretical prediction .",
    "an accurate measurement of the clustering of groups is now particularly timely as theoretical models have advanced to the point where detailed predictions can be made for the clustering of galactic systems .",
    "techniques have been developed recently that allow high resolution n - body simulations of hierarchical clustering to be populated with galaxies using semi - analytic models ( kauffmann et al . 1999 ; benson et al . 2000 ; helly et al .",
    "the models make firm predictions for how the luminous baryonic component of the universe is partitioned between dark matter haloes .",
    "a significant advance in statistical studies of group properties was made possible by the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al .",
    "2001 ; 2003 ) .",
    "merchn & zandivarez ( 2002 ) used the 2dfgrs 100k data release to construct a group catalogue , the 2dfggc , consisting of 2198 groups with at least four members .",
    "the correlation function of the 2dfggc in redshift space can be described by a power law with correlation length @xmath5mpc and slope @xmath6 ( zandivarez , merchn & padilla 2003 ) .",
    "the clustering amplitude of 2dfggc groups is significantly higher than that measured for 2dfgrs galaxies , for which @xmath7mpc ( hawkins et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the completion of the 2dfgrs has made it possible to construct a much larger group catalogue , the 2dfgrs percolation inferred galaxy group catalogue ( hereafter the 2pigg catalogue ; eke et al .",
    "the gain is bigger than the simple factor of just over @xmath8 increase in the number of galaxy redshifts ; the improved homogeneity and higher spectroscopic completeness means that group finding is far more efficient in the final 2dfgrs catalogue . to quantify this improvement",
    ", the number of groups with a minimum of four members in the 2pigg catalogue is 7200 , over three times the number of comparable groups detected by merchn & zandivarez ( 2002 ) .",

    "demonstrate that the group finding algorithm can be pushed further still to extract groups containing two or more members , which greatly increases the number of groups .    in this paper",

    "the _ rms _ scatter is the resulting mean scatter .",
    "this procedure gives an _ rms _ scatter that is larger than the formal variance over the ensemble of mocks , since , to some extent , it takes into account the covariance between the correlation function measurements in different bins .",
    "the fractional _ rms _ scatter obtained from the mocks is taken as an estimate of the statistical error and is applied to the measured correlation functions .",
    "one could consider dividing the 2pigg catalogue into either cumulative or differential bins in a property related to group mass .",
    "naively , one might anticipate that a division into differential mass bins would give a cleaner trend of clustering amplitude varying with increasing sample mass , since the clustering signal from cumulative samples might be dominated by the most massive objects . to investigate this prejudice , we use theoretical models of the clustering of dark matter haloes and ascertain which of these two alternatives is the best way to split up the 2pigg catalogue .",
    "the theoretical predictions for halo clustering are based upon the formalism developed by cole & kaiser ( 1989 ) and mo & white ( 1996 ; hereafter mw ) .",

    "following eke et al .",
    "( 2004a ) , we have considered two possibilities : ( i ) a dynamical mass estimate that depends upon the _ rms _ radius of the group and its estimated velocity dispersion .",

    "[ fig : ml ] shows the relation between corrected total group luminosity and the true group mass for the galform mock .",
    "the total group luminosity is obtained by summing the luminosity of the galaxies identified as members of each group , and then applying a correction to account for missing galaxies that are fainter than the apparent magnitude limit of the 2dfgrs .",

    "this is due to the fact that such large groups , because of their rarity , are more likely to be found at higher redshifts , and therefore require a larger correction to be applied to the observed group luminosity to infer the total group luminosity .",

    "we have tuned the algorithm for measuring the clustering of 2pigg groups by requiring a close match between the correlation functions estimated from the mocks and the original results from the simulation cube .",

    "2004a ) .    the difference between the clustering amplitude measured for the full 2pigg and the full 2dfgrs galaxy samples can be readily understood in terms of the hod .",
    "ideally , the groups have a one - to - one correspondence with the underlying dark matter haloes within some mass interval .",
    "the galaxies obviously sample haloes in the same mass range , but with a weight that increases with halo mass , since the most massive haloes host more than one galaxy .",
