    "this means that only the fitness ranks matter and so the exact distribution of a virus fitness will not play a role .",
    "the main result of @xcite is the asymptotic behaviour of the dominating type , whether it is expected to remain the same for long stretches of time or change often .",

    "descriptively @xmath14 is the @xmath16th return from state @xmath15 to the state of one virus type alive , since from @xmath8 the chain has to jump to two types .",
