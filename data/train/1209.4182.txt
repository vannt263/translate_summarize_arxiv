    "the nucleus - nucleus collisions at top rhic energy produce an initial hot and dense matter ( quark - gluon mater , qgm ) .",
    "it has been interpreted as a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) @xcite .",
    "this is nearly a perfect liquid composed of quarks and gluons but is not a free gas - like quark - gluon plasma ( fqgp ) expected by theorists and experimentalists long time ago .",
    "the anti - nuclei production is great importance in the nuclear and particle physics , the astrophysics , and the cosmology .",
    "one believes that the matter and antimatter exist in equal abundance during the initial stage of the universe .",
    "however , a mystery exists : how this symmetry got lost in the evolution of the universe with no significant amount of antimatter being present .",
    "because the initial fireball created in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions is similar to the initial stage of the universe , the study of anti - nuclei production in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions may light this issue .",
    "however , the study of light nuclei ( anti - nuclei ) production is quite hard both experimentally and theoretically because of the low production multiplicity .",
    "the star collaboration has reported their measurements of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in au+au collisions at the top rhic energy @xcite . they have measured ",
    "70@xmath1417 antihypertritons ( @xmath10 ) and 157@xmath15 hypertritons ( @xmath12 ) \" in the 89 million minimum - bias and 22 million central (  head - on \" ) au+au collision events at @xmath1=200 gev .",
    "thus the corresponding yields are estimated to be 6.31@xmath16 and 1.41@xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the alice collaboration has also published their preliminary @xmath18 yield of @xmath19 measured in the pp collisions at @xmath20=7 tev @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the theoretical study of light nuclei ( anti - nuclei ) is usually separated into two steps .",
    "the nucleons and hyperons are first calculated with some selected models , such as the transport models .",
    "then the light nuclei ( anti - nuclei ) are calculated by the phase space coalescence model @xcite and/or the statistical model @xcite etc .",
    "recently , production of light nuclei ( hypernuclei ) in au+au / pb+pb collisions at relativistic energies have been investigated theoretically by the coalescence+blast - wave method @xcite and the urqmd - hydro hybrid model+ thermal model @xcite , respectively .",
    "we have proposed an approach studying the light nuclei ( anti - nuclei ) production in ultra - relativistic pp collisions by dynamically constrained phase - space coalescence model @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the final hadronic state generated by a parton and hadron cascade model paciae @xcite . the calculated light nuclei ( anti - nuclei )",
    "yield in non - single diffractive ( nsd ) pp collisions at @xmath21=7 tev is well comparing with alice data @xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution and rapidity distribution are also predicted for @xmath22 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath23 ( @xmath13 ) in nsd pp collisions at @xmath24=7 and 14 tev . in this paper , we use this method to investigate the light nuclei ( anti - nuclei ) and hypernuclei ( anti - hypernuclei ) productions in the au+au collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the paciae model and the dynamically constrained coalescence model . in sec .",
    "iii , the calculated light nuclei ( anti - nuclei ) and hypernuclei ( anti - hypernuclei ) yields , ratios , as well as the transverse momentum distributions are given and compared with the star data . a short summary is the content of sec .",
    "the pythia model @xcite is devised for the high energy hadron - hadron ( @xmath25 ) collisions . in this model , a hh collision is decomposed into the parton - parton collisions . the hard parton - parton scattering is described by the leading order perturbative qcd ( lo - pqcd ) parton - parton interactions with the modification of parton distribution function in a hadron .",
    "the soft parton - parton collision , a non - perturbative phenomenon , is considered empirically .",
    "the initial- and final - state qcd radiations and the multiparton interactions are also taken into account .",
    "therefore , the consequence of a hh collision is a partonic multijet state composed of di - quarks ( anti - diquarks ) , quarks ( antiquarks ) and gluons , as well as a few hadronic remnants .",
    "this is then followed by the string construction and fragmentation .",
    "a hadronic final state is obtained for a hh collision eventually .",
    "the parton and hadron cascade model paciae @xcite is based on pythia and is devised for the nucleus - nucleus collisions mainly . in the paciae model , first of all the nucleus - nucleus collision is decomposed into the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions according to the collision geometry and nn total cross section .",
    "each nn collision is described by the pythia model with the string fragmentation switches - off and the di - quarks ( anti - diquarks ) randomly breaks into quarks ( anti - quarks ) .",
    "so the consequence of a nn collision is now a partonic initial state composed of quarks , anti - quarks , and gluons .",
    "provided all nn collisions are exhausted , one obtains a partonic initial state for a nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "this partonic initial state is regarded as the quark - gluon matter ( qgm ) formed in the relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "secondary , the parton rescattering proceeds .",
    "the rescattering among partons in qgm is randomly considered by the 2 @xmath26 2 lo - pqcd parton - parton interaction cross sections @xcite .",
    "in addition , a @xmath27 factor is introduced here to include the higher order and the non - perturbative corrections .",
    "thirdly , the hadronization follows after the parton rescattering .",
    "the partonic matter can be hadronized by the lund string fragmentation regime @xcite and/or the phenomenological coalescence model @xcite .",
    "finally , the hadronic matter proceeds rescattering until the hadronic freeze - out ( the exhaustion of the hadron - hadron collision pairs ) . we refer to @xcite for the details .    in quantum statistical mechanics",
    "@xcite one can not precisely define both position @xmath28 and momentum @xmath29 of a particle in the six dimension phase space , because of the uncertainty principle @xmath30 we can only say this particle lies somewhere within a six dimension quantum  box \" or  state \" with volume of @xmath31 .",
    "a particle state occupies a volume of @xmath32 in the six dimension phase space @xcite . therefore one can estimate the yield of a single particle by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the hamiltonian and energy of the particle , respectively .",
    "similarly , the yield of n particle cluster can be estimated by @xmath36    therefore the @xmath13 yield in our dynamically constrained phase space coalescence model , for instance , is assumed to be @xmath37 where @xmath38^{1/2 } , \\label{yield2}\\ ] ] here ( @xmath39 ) and ( @xmath40 ) are the energy and momentum of particles @xmath41 , respectively . in eq .",

    "as the hadron position and momentum distributions from transport model simulation are discrete , the integral over continuous distributions in eq .",
    "( [ yield1 ] ) should be replaced by the sum over discrete distributions . in a single event of the final hadronic state obtained from transport model simulation , the configuration of @xmath13 ( @xmath48+@xmath49+@xmath50 ) system can be expressed as @xmath51 where the subscripts @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 refers to the distance between @xmath48 and the center - of - mass of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 for instance . then the third constraint ( diameter constraint ) in eq .",
    "( [ yield1 ] ) is correspondingly replaced by @xmath56 where @xmath57 refers to the radius of @xmath13 .",
    "each of the above configuration contributes a partial yield of @xmath58 to the @xmath13 .",
    "so the total yield of @xmath13 in a single event is the sum of the above partial yield over the configurations of eq .",
    "( [ conf ] ) and their combinations .",
