    "@xmath7-free ordered set ( see for example @xcite ) . it was proved in @xcite that the number of ( unlabeled ) @xmath7-free ordered sets is    @xmath32    our main result is this .",
    "[ nfreeinterval ] every finite @xmath7-free ordered set which is not totally ordered has a balanced pair .    the proof of theorem [ nfreeinterval ] is similar to the proof of theorem 2 of @xcite stating that the 1/3 - 2/3 conjecture is true for finite ordered sets of width two ( these being the ordered sets covered by two chains ) .",
    "we start this section by stating some useful properties of @xmath7-free ordered sets .",

    "we recall that the decomposition of @xmath3 into _ levels _ is the sequence @xmath39 defined by induction by the formula @xmath40 in particular , @xmath41 .      if @xmath4 has at most one upper cover , then the conclusion of the lemma holds .",
    "so we may assume that @xmath4 has at least two distinct upper covers @xmath45 and @xmath46 belonging to two distinct levels .",

    "we claim that @xmath51 is an @xmath7 in @xmath3 contradicting our assumption that @xmath3 is @xmath7-free .",
    "indeed , since @xmath45 and @xmath46 are upper covers of @xmath4 we infer that they must be incomparable .",
    "moreover , @xmath45 and @xmath52 are incomparable because otherwise @xmath53 ( notice that @xmath54 is not possible since @xmath55 ) which contradicts our assumption that @xmath46 is an upper cover of @xmath4 .",
    "similarly we have that @xmath4 and @xmath52 are incomparable proving our claim .",
    "the proof of the lemma is now complete .",

    "let @xmath58 be such that @xmath59 is the largest with the property that @xmath44 contains two distinct elements with the same set of lower covers .",
    "then for every @xmath60 we have that @xmath61 is a chain .",
    "let @xmath60 be such that @xmath62 and suppose that @xmath63 is not a chain .",
    "there is then an element @xmath64 having at least two distinct upper covers , say @xmath65 . from lemma  [ l2 ]",
    "we deduce that @xmath66 and @xmath67 are in the same level @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "because @xmath3 is @xmath7-free it follows from lemma [ l2 ] that @xmath66 and @xmath67 have the same set of lower covers .",

    "we prove the theorem by contradiction .",
    "we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath90 indeed , if @xmath91 , then the situation is symmetric with respect to @xmath28 and @xmath27 and therefore such an assumption is possible .",
