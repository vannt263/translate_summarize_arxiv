    "the aim of the paper is to study a new notion of two - scale convergence which is very natural and , in our opinion , gives a more straightforward approach to the homogenization process : while removing the bother of the admissibility of test functions @xcite , it nevertheless simplifies the proof of all standard compactness results which made _ classical _ two - scale convergence ( introduced in @xcite ) very worthy of interest .",
    "attempts to overcome the question of admissibility of test functions arising in the definition of two - scale convergence have been the subject of various authors @xcite . among them , the periodic unfolding method is considered one of the most successful .",
    "the idea , as well as its nomenclature , is introduced @xcite where the authors exploit a natural , although purely mathematical , intuition to recover two - scale convergence as a classical functional weak convergence in a suitable larger space .",
    "this recovery process is achieved by introducing the so - called unfolding operator which , roughly speaking , turns a sequence of @xmath3-scale functions into a sequence of @xmath4-scale functions .    on the other hand ,",
    "as it is simple to show by playing with lebesgue differentiation theorem , the recovery process is not univocal , and many alternatives are possible . in guessing the one",
    "presented below , we did not rely on mathematical intuition only , but we found inspiration from the physics of the homogenization process .",
    "that is why we think it is important to dwell on some preliminary considerations before giving definitions , theorems and proofs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : intro.newapproach ] we explain the idea behind the proposed approach which will be formalized in section [ sec:2na ] . in section [ sec:3compact ]",
    "we establish compactness results for the new notion of two - scale convergence which play a central role in the homogenization process . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we test the effectiveness of our notion of convergence on the classical model problem in the theory of homogenization , i.e the one associate to a family of linear second - order elliptic partial differential equation with periodically oscillating coefficients .",
    "section [ sec : correctorh1conv ] is devoted to the so - called first - order corrector results which aim to improve the convergence of the solution gradients by adding corrector term . in section [ sec:6bl ]",
    "we introduce the well - known boundary layer terms which aim to compensate the fast oscillation of the family of solutions near the boundary .",
    "eventually , in section [ sec : homharmonicmaps ] we test the approach on a nonlinear problem : we prove a weak two - scale compactness result for @xmath2-valued stationary harmonic map , and make some remarks which point out some possible weaknesses of this alternative notion of two - scale convergence .",
    "let us focus on the classical model problem in homogenization : a linear second - order partial differential equation with periodically oscillating coefficients .",
    "such an equations models , for example , the stationary heat conduction in a periodic composite medium @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath5 the material domain ( a bounded open set in @xmath6 ) and by @xmath7^n$ ] the unit cell of @xmath6 . denoting by @xmath8 the source term and enforcing a dirichlet boundary condition for the unknown @xmath9 , the model equation reads as @xmath10 where , for any @xmath11",
    ", we have defined @xmath12 by @xmath13 , with @xmath14 ( the so - called _ matrix of diffusion coefficients _ ) an @xmath15 and @xmath16-periodic matrix valued function , which is uniformly coercive , i.e. such that for two positive constants @xmath17 one has ( for a.e .",
    "@xmath18 ) @xmath19 for every @xmath20 .",
    "here we have supposed @xmath14 depending on the periodic variable only although later we will work with the more general case in which @xmath14 depends on the @xmath21 variable too . the weak formulation of problem ( [ eq : model - problem ] ) reads as : @xmath22 and according to lax - milgram theorem for each @xmath11 there exists a unique weak solution @xmath23 of ( [ eq : model - problemwf ] ) .",
    "the family of solutions @xmath24 and the family of _ fluxes _ @xmath25 , constitute bounded subsets respectively of @xmath26 and @xmath27 . thus there",
    "exist subfamilies ( that we still denote by @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) and elements @xmath30 such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 weakly in @xmath27 .",
    "hence , passing to the limit in ( [ eq : model - problemwf ] ) , we get @xmath33 , where the limit flux @xmath34 is the weak limit of the product of the weakly convergent sequences @xmath31 and @xmath35 .",
    "the identification of the limit flux @xmath34 in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath14 is the first aim in the mathematical theory of periodic homogenization .",
    "a procedure for the homogenization of problem ( [ eq : model - problem ] ) appeared in 1989 by the means of the so - called two - scale convergence .",
    "this notion , introduced for the first time by nguetseng in @xcite , was later named two - scale convergence by allaire @xcite who further developed the notion by giving more direct proofs of the main compactness results .",
    "to better understand the idea behind the classical two - scale approach , let us recall the following compactness results @xcite , from which the notion of two - scale convergence originates :    if @xmath28 is a bounded sequence in @xmath37 , there exists @xmath38 , such that , up to a subsequence @xmath39 for any test function spaces that consist of periodic functions . ]",
    "@xmath40 $ ] . moreover , if @xmath28 is a bounded sequence in @xmath41 , then there exist functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 $ ] such that , up to a subsequence @xmath44 for any test function @xmath45^n$ ] .",
    "if we assume that the heterogeneities are evenly distributed inside the media @xmath5 , we can model the material as periodic . as illustrated in the figure , this means that we can think of the material as being immersed in a grid of small identical cubes @xmath46 , the side - length of which is @xmath47 . ]",
    "it is then natural to give the following ( see @xcite )    a sequence of functions @xmath9 in @xmath27 _ two - scale _ converges to a limit @xmath48 if , for any function @xmath49 $ ] we have @xmath50 in that case we write @xmath51 .",
    "we say that the sequence @xmath52 strongly two - scale converges to a limit @xmath53 , if @xmath51 and @xmath54 .",
    "it is now immediate to understand the role played by two - scale convergence in the homogenization process . indeed , by writing ( [ eq : model - problemwf ] ) in the form @xmath55 and choosing the right shape for the test functions @xmath56 , it is possible to interpret the left - hand side of the previous relation as the product of a strongly two - scale convergent sequence ( namely @xmath57 ) with the weakly two - scale convergent sequence @xmath58 , from which weak two - scale convergence of the product , and hence the homogenized equation , easily follows ( cfr .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "unfortunately , for this procedure to be possible it is essential to add a technical hypothesis : the sequence of coefficients @xmath59 must be _ admissible _ in the sense that ( cfr .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath60 it turns out that this is a subtle notion .",
    "indeed , for a given function @xmath61 $ ] there is no reasonable way to give a meaning to the trace function @xmath62 .",
    "the complete space of admissible functions is not known much more precisely .",
    "functions in @xmath63 $ ] as well as @xmath64 $ ] are admissible , but it is unclear how much the regularity of @xmath65 can be weakened : we refer to @xcite for an explicit construction of a non admissible function which belongs to @xmath66 $ ] .      the classical approach to periodic homogenization originates by the modeling assumption that since the heterogeneities are evenly distributed inside the media @xmath5 , we can think of the material as being immersed in a grid of small identical cubes @xmath67 , the side - length of which is @xmath47 ( see figure [ fig : perhom1 ] ) . if we denote by @xmath68 , with @xmath69 , a translated copy of @xmath5 such that @xmath70 , this modeling approach assumes that , at scale @xmath47 , the contribution of the diffusion coefficients at any @xmath71 , is given by @xmath72 both if we focus on the problem @xmath73 in @xmath5 and on the problem @xmath74 @xmath75 in @xmath76 .",
    "although this assumption is mathematically reasonable when @xmath47 tends to be very small , it is nevertheless the reason why the two - scale convergence produces two - variables functions starting from a family of one - variable functions .",
    "more realistic is to think of the material as being immersed in a grid of small identical cubes @xmath46 , up to an unknown translation of size smaller than @xmath47 .",
    "we thus consider all possible translations , which we take into account by the introduction of a new variable . ]    on the other hand , it is clear that a more realistic approach consists in taking into account the effects of the diffusion coefficients @xmath77 via a family of displacement of length at most @xmath47 , i.e. via the family of diffusion coefficients @xmath78 , and hence ( see figure [ fig : perhom2 ] ) via the family of boundary value problems depending on the cell - size parameter @xmath79 and on the translation parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the new homogenized problem then goes through the following two steps : for every @xmath79 find ( in a suitable sense ) a @xmath16-periodic solution @xmath80 of the dirichlet problem @xmath81 then take the average @xmath82 as a more realistic modelization of the solution associated , at scale @xmath47 , to evenly distributed heterogeneities inside the media @xmath5 .    in this framework",
    "the homogenization process demands for the computation of the limiting behaviour , as @xmath83 , of the family of two variable solutions @xmath80 , i.e. for an asymptotic expansion of the form @xmath84 in which @xmath36 is the solution of the homogenized equation and @xmath85 is the so - called _ first order corrector _ ( cfr .",
    "the analogues definitions in @xcite ) .",
    "we are now in position to explain the new approach . to this end , let us introduce the operator @xmath86 \\mapsto u ( x , y - x / \\varepsilon ) \\in l^2_{\\sharp } [ { y } , l^2    ( \\omega ) ] .",

    "<S> the aim of the paper is to introduce an alternative notion of two - scale convergence which gives a more natural modeling approach to the homogenization of partial differential equations with periodically oscillating coefficients : while removing the bother of the admissibility of test functions , it nevertheless simplifies the proof of all the standard compactness results which made classical two - scale convergence very worthy of interest : bounded sequences in @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] are proven to be relatively compact with respect to this new type of convergence . </S>",
    "<S> the strengths of the notion are highlighted on the classical homogenization problem of linear second - order elliptic equations for which first order boundary corrector - type results are also established . eventually , possible weaknesses of the method are pointed out on a nonlinear problem : the weak two - scale compactness result for @xmath2-valued stationary harmonic maps .    </S>",
