    "the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with an external potential @xmath0 ( the so - called gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation ) @xmath1 is used to describe a lot of phenomena in physics . in particular , it describes the evolution of bose - einstein condensates in dilute boson gases at low temperatures .",
    "also this equation appears in studying laser beams in kerr media and focusing nonlinearity ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .    for applications it is desirable to get exact solution of the initial value ( iv ) problem for equation ( [ 1 ] ) , because it is helpful for describing detailed aspects of a particular physical system , when the approximate methods could be inadequate .",
    "but even in one dimension , it is hard to obtain such solutions .",
    "a reduction of ( [ 1 ] ) , related to short - range interactions , consists in replacing @xmath0 by a point singular potential . in the one - dimensional case , @xmath2 . assuming that the initial data @xmath3 is an _ even _ function , the solution is even for all @xmath4 , and the iv problem    @xmath5    can be reduced to the initial - boundary value ( ibv ) problem for the nls equation without the singular term , with the robin _ homogeneous _ boundary condition , see @xcite : @xmath6    in the latter problem , the boundary conditions are called _ linearizable _ , because in this case there exists an adaptation of the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) method , which turns to be as efficient as the ist method for the initial value problem ( on the whole line ) , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ; namely , solving the problem reduces to solving a sequence of _ linear _ problems .",
    "particularly , in @xcite the authors have studied in details the long - time behavior of the solution of ( [ 1.0 ] ) by applying the nonlinear steepest - descent method for riemann  hilbert problems introduced by deift and zhou @xcite .",
    "however , in the general case , when @xmath7 is not assumed to be even , ( [ 1.0 ] ) does not reduce to ( [ 1.1 ] ) and thus the approach of @xcite can not be applied directly .    in solving a nonlinear problem ,",
    "it is natural to solve , first , the associated linearized problem : @xmath8 when trying to reduce ( [ 1.2 ] ) to a problem on a half - line , we arrive , instead of one problem ( [ 1.1 ] ) , at a system of two coupled half - line problems , see ( [ d3 ] ) and ( [ d4 ] ) below . our approach is based on using the fokas unified transform method ( initiated by fokas @xcite ) to this system . for a detailed account of this approach , see @xcite .",
    "since the unified transform method is known as providing effective solutions to both linear and nonlinear integrable equations , the present paper can be viewed as a step in solving the initial value problem for the non - stationary _ nonlinear _ schrdinger equation with a point singular potential .",
    "the unified transform method is based on the so - called _ lax pair _ representation of an equation in question .",
    "recall that the lax pair of a given ( partial differential ) equation is a system of linear ordinary differential equations involving an additional ( spectral ) parameter , such that the given equation is the compatibly condition of this system .",
    "originally , the lax pair representation was introduced for certain nonlinear evolution equations , called integrable ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this representation plays a key role in solving initial value problems for such equations by the inverse scattering transform method , where one ( spatial ) equation from the pair establishes a change of variables , passing from functions of the spatial variable to functions of the spectral parameter , whereas the evolution in time turns out to be , due to the second equation , linear .    according to the approach initiated by fokas for studying initial _",
    "boundary _ value problems for such nonlinear equations , both equations from the lax pair are considered as spectral problems .    while only very special ( although very important ) nonlinear equations have a lax pair representation ( the nls equation in ( [ 1.1 ] ) is one of them ) , the lax pair for linear equations with constant coefficients can be constructed algorithmically .",
    "particularly , the lax pair for the linearized form of the nls equation , @xmath9 , is as follows : @xmath10 indeed , direct calculations show that the compatibly condition of ( [ 2.5 ] ) , which is the equality @xmath11 to be satisfied for all @xmath12 , reads @xmath9 .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate how to obtain an integral representation of the solution of problem ( [ 1.2 ] ) using the ideas of the fokas method .",
    "since this method for both linear and integrable nonlinear equations uses the similar ingredients  the lax pair representation and the analysis of the so - called global relation  we believe that our result can be useful for studying the initial value problem for the non - stationary _ nonlinear _ schrdinger equation with a point singular potential .",
    "in what follows we will consider the iv problem for the linear time - depended schrdinger equation with one - delta potential in the form @xmath13 where @xmath7 is a smooth function decaying as @xmath14 ( below we will specify the meaning of this ) .",
    "first , let us assume that the solution @xmath15 of the problem ( [ d1 ] ) exists , such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 as @xmath18 for all @xmath4 . under this assumptions we will find the exact formula for solution @xmath15 .",
    "then we impose some restrictions on the initial value @xmath19 , which guarantee that the obtained formulas solve the problem ( [ d1 ] ) .",
    "since the delta function @xmath20 introduces the jump @xmath21 , ( [ d1 ] ) is equivalent to the following system @xmath22    let @xmath23    @xmath24    then the jump relations yield @xmath25    since @xmath15 is a continuous function , we can introduce @xmath26 then the initial value problem ( [ d2 ] ) is equivalent to the following coupled initial boundary value problems , with the _ inhomogeneous _ boundary conditions : @xmath27 @xmath28 we emphasize that neither @xmath29 nor @xmath30 are known , but problems ( [ d3 ] ) and ( [ d4 ] ) are coupled by the conditions that these functions are the same in the both problems .    in what follows , we will use the following notations for the direct and inverse fourier transforms : @xmath31 @xmath32    now , let us assume for a moment that the functions @xmath30 and @xmath29 are given . then , using the lax pair for both equations @xmath33 , @xmath34 , we can obtain explicitly the solutions of ( [ d3 ] ) and ( [ d4 ] ) .    let @xmath35 then @xmath36 , @xmath37 can be obtained in terms of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and the fourier transform of @xmath7 as follows : @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath34 .    _",

    ", these equations are called the _ global relations_.    global relations are algebraic relations between the initial and boundary values of a given ibv problem @xcite . in our case , only the spectral functions @xmath67 , @xmath37 , associated with the initial data @xmath7 are given whereas the spectral functions @xmath68 , @xmath37 are unknown .",
