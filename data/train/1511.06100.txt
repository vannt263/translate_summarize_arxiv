    "such a twisted tensor product was first constructed by nest and voigt in the case where @xmath6 is the quantum double or the drinfeld double of some regular locally compact quantum group  @xmath7 or , equivalently , when @xmath2 and @xmath3 are yetter - drinfeld @xmath0-algebras over @xmath7 @xcite*proposition 3.2 . a systematic study of quantum group - twisted tensor products , in the general framework of manageable multiplicative unitaries ,",

    "universal _ or _ maximal _ counterpart to the constructions in @xcite . as in @xcite",
    ", we start with two  @xmath0-quantum groups @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( in the sense of  @xcite ) , a bicharacter @xmath9 and two @xmath0-algebras  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 equipped with coactions of  @xmath6 and  @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "we then consider representations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 on the same @xmath0-algebra that commute in a braided fashion with respect to @xmath10 , and construct a  @xmath0-algebra  @xmath11 with nondegenerate * -homomorphisms  @xmath12 and @xmath13 such that @xmath14 is a universal pair of braided - commuting representations .",
    "for example , this construction subsumes the following special cases .    1 .",
    "if @xmath10 is trivial , it reduces to the maximal tensor product @xmath15 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath16 , so that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are @xmath17-graded @xmath0-algebras , we obtain the universal @xmath0-algebra generated by a copy of @xmath2 and a copy of @xmath3 satisfying @xmath18 for homogeneous elements @xmath19 and @xmath20 of degrees @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath22 and @xmath3 is the universal dual @xmath0-algebra of @xmath6 , we obtain the universal crossed product @xmath23 .",
    "our maximal twisted tensor product shares many of the properties of the minimal twisted tensor product , which we denote by   @xmath24 , established in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we show that it carries a canonical coaction of the generalised drinfeld double @xmath25 ( see @xcite ) , yields a monoidal structure on the category of @xmath6-@xmath0-algebras in the case where @xmath6 is quasi - triangular , and is functorial with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath7 in a natural sense .",
    "we also show that the maximal and the minimal twisted and non - twisted tensor products are related by a commutative diagram of the form @xmath26^{\\cong } \\ar@{->>}[d ] & ( c { \\otimes_{{\\mathrm{max}}}}d ) \\rtimes ( { \\mathbb{g}}\\times { \\mathbb{h } } ) \\ar@{->>}[d ] \\\\      ( c \\boxtimes^{\\chi}_{\\min } d ) \\rtimes { \\mathfrak{d}_{\\chi}({\\mathbb{g}},{\\mathbb{h } } ) }   \\ar[r]^{\\cong } & ( c \\otimes d ) \\rtimes ( { \\mathbb{g}}\\times { \\mathbb{h } } ) ,      } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the lower isomorphism extends @xcite*theorem 6.5 .",
    "the upper isomorphism yields a quick proof of the following result , which extends our list of examples :    1 .",
    "if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are duals of locally compact abelian groups , then @xmath27 is a rieffel deformation of the maximal tensor product @xmath15 in the sense of kasprzak @xcite .    the corresponding assertion for the minimal twisted tensor product is contained in @xcite*theorem 6.2 .",
    "if @xmath2 or @xmath3 are nuclear , then implies that the images of @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the respective crossed products on the left hand side , but not necessarily the algebras themselves , are isomorphic . in particular , the canonical map from the maximal to the minimal twisted tensor product is an isomorphism if ( i ) @xmath2 or @xmath3 is nuclear and additionally ( ii ) the coaction of @xmath25 on @xmath27 is injective .",
    "finally , we consider the case where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are generalized yetter - drinfeld @xmath0-algebras , show that the maximal twisted tensor product is a generalized yetter - drinfeld @xmath0-algebra again , and obtain a bicategory whose objects are @xmath0-quantum groups and 1-morphisms are generalized yetter - drinfeld @xmath0-algebras . here",
    ", we need to work with coactions of universal @xmath0-quantum groups .",
    "a recurring issue that arises here is to verify that certain pairs of representations of the @xmath0-algebras @xmath2 and @xmath3 or of the @xmath0-algebras @xmath29 and @xmath30 underlying the @xmath0-quantum groups @xmath6 and @xmath7 satisfy braided commutation relations , and to check how such relations transform if various representations are put together . instead of case - by - case calculations , we present a categorical approach where braided - commuting representations are interpreted as 2-morphisms in cubical tricategory , and the horizontal and vertical compositions account for all constructions that we need to consider .",
