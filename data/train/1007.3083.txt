    "even though first results for next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to heavy quark production were presented in the late 80 s and early 90 s @xcite the topic of higher order corrections to @xmath2 is still very active and far from complete .",
    "our present level of understanding is very well summarized in experimental and theoretical reviews , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "recent progress in nlo @xcite and next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) @xcite calculations , as well as next - to - next - to - leading - log resummations ( nnll ) @xcite for inclusive @xmath2 hadroproduction is truly astonishing .",
    "the list for the more exclusive channels is just as impressive : nlo qcd corrections have been calculated for the @xmath3 signal @xcite , where the higgs boson has been treated as a stable particle .",
    "most recently the factorisable qcd corrections to this process have been presented @xcite , where higher order corrections to both production and decay of the higgs boson into a @xmath4 pair have been calculated .",
    "moreover , nlo qcd corrections to a variety of @xmath5 backgrounds processes @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite have been obtained .",
    "last but not least , the nlo qcd corrections to the @xmath9 backgrounds processes such as @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite have also recently been completed .    both processes @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent very important background reactions to searches at the lhc , in particular to @xmath3 production , where the higgs boson decays into a @xmath12 pair .",
    "a successful analysis of this particular production channel requires the knowledge of direct @xmath0 and @xmath1 production at nlo in qcd @xcite . in this contribution , a brief report on these computations is given .",
    "nlo qcd corrections have been calculated within the helac - nlo framework .",
    "it consists of helac - phegas @xcite , which has , on its own , already been extensively used and tested in phenomenological studies see _ e.g _ @xcite .",
    "helac - phegas is a multi - purpose , tree - level event generator which is the only existing implementation of the algorithm based on dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "it can be used to efficiently obtain helicity amplitudes and total cross sections for arbitrary multiparticle processes in the standard model .",
    "the program can generate all processes with 10 or more final state particles with full off - shell and finite width effects taking into account naturally both , spin and color correlations .",
    "the integration over the fractions @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the initial partons is done via parni @xcite .",
    "virtual corrections are obtained using the helac-1loop program @xcite , based on the ossola - papadopoulos - pittau ( opp ) reduction technique @xcite and the reduction code cuttools @xcite . moreover ,",
    "oneloop @xcite library has been used for the evaluation of the scalar integrals .",
    "reweighting techniques , and helicity and colour sampling methods are used in order to optimize the performance of our system .",
    "the opp reduction at the integrand level takes advantage of the knowledge that the final answer for one loop amplitudes can be expressed in terms of a basis of known @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18point scalar integrals : boxes , triangles , bubbles and tadpoles : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the so called rational part and @xmath21 are coefficients which have to be derived .",
    "the opp method aims at computing them directly avoiding any computationally intensive integral reduction .",
    "the opp reduction is based on a representation of the numerator of amplitudes , a polynomial in the integration momentum , in a basis of polynomials given by products of the functions in the denominators .",
    "clearly , the cancellation of such terms with the actual denominators will lead to scalar functions with a lower number of denominators . by virtue of the proof provided by the passarino - veltman reduction @xcite",
    ", we will end up with a tower of four - point and lower functions , as mentioned before . the determination of the decomposition in the new basis proceeds recursively , by setting chosen denominators on - shell .",
    "this is where the opp method resembles generalized unitarity @xcite .",
    "for most recent applications see _ e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress , that working around four dimensions , allows to compute the numerator function in four dimensions .",
    "the difference to the complete result is of order @xmath22 , and can therefore be determined a posteriori in a simplified manner @xcite . since the calculation of the coefficients of the reduction requires the evaluation of the numerator function for a given value of the loop momentum , the corresponding diagrams can be thought of as tree level ( all momenta are fixed ) graphs . to complete the analogy , one needs to chose a propagator and consider it as cut . at this point",
    "the original amplitude for an @xmath23 particle process becomes a tree level amplitude for an @xmath24 particle process .",
    "the advantage is that its value can be obtained by a tree level automate such as helac - phegas .",
    "the bookkeeping necessary for a practical implementation is managed by a new software , helac-1loop .",
    "the opp method has already been successfully applied to a large number of processes , apart from already mentioned @xmath0 , @xmath25 and @xmath1 also to the production of three vector bosons , namely @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 final states at the lhc @xcite and to the calculation of one - loop qed corrections to the hard - bremsstrahlung process @xmath30 at @xmath31 colliders @xcite .",
    "recently the opp - approach has been implemented in the another framework called samurai @xcite , together with an extention which accommodate an implementation of the generalized d - dimensional unitarity - cuts technique .",
    "the singularities from soft or collinear parton emission are isolated via dipole subtraction for nlo qcd calculations @xcite using the formulation for massive quarks @xcite and for arbitrary polarizations @xcite . after combining virtual and real corrections ,",
    "singularities connected to collinear configurations in the final state as well as soft divergencies in the initial and final states cancel for infrared - safe observables automatically .",
    "singularities connected to collinear initial - state splittings are removed via factorization by pdf redefinitions .",
    "calculations are performed with the help of the helac - dipoles software @xcite , which is a complete and publicly available automatic implementation of catani - seymour dipole subtraction and consists of phase space integration of subtracted real radiation and integrated dipoles in both massless and massive cases .",
    "the phase space restriction on the contribution of the dipoles as originally proposed in @xcite is also implemented .",
    "two values of the unphysical cutoff are always considered ; @xmath32 , which corresponds to the case when all dipoles are included , and @xmath33 .",
    "the independence of the final result on this cutoff is explicitly checked in all our results , both for the integrated cross section and for the differential distributions .",
    "moreover , also in this part helicity sampling methods are used in order to speed up the calculation .",
    "the cancellation of divergences between the real and virtual corrections is always verified .",
    "in addition , the numerical precision of the latter has been assured by using gauge invariance tests and use of quadruple precision .",
    "let us emphasise that all parts are calculated fully numerically in a completely automatic manner .",
    "finally , the phase - space integration is performed with the multichannel monte carlo generator phegas @xcite and kaleu @xcite .",

    "we have obtained negative corrections of the order of 11% . in both cases a dramatic reduction of the scale uncertainty is observed while going from lo to nlo .",
    "the residual scale uncertainties of the nlo predictions for the irreducible background are at the 33% level , while for the reducible background the error obtained by scale variation is of the order of 11% .",
    "the scale dependence of the corrections for both processes is graphically presented in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : ttjj ] the transverse momentum distributions of the hardest and second hardest jet are shown for the @xmath66 process .",

    "strongly altered shapes are visible at high @xmath67 especially in case of the first hardest jet .",
