    "when a non - magnetic normal metal is in contact with a superconductor it acquires superconducting properties .",
    "this effect , known as the proximity effect @xcite , has extensively been studied for almost @xmath1 years , and is rather well understood in terms of andreev reflections @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the proximity effect between a ferromagnet ( @xmath2 ) and a superconductor ( @xmath3 ) is less understood .",
    "however recent advance in nanofabrication made it possible to produce high quality @xmath2/@xmath3 interfaces @xcite and hence there is much current interest in the study of the interplay between magnetism and superocnductivity in heterostructures involving such surfaces @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that ferromagnetism is destructive for superconductivity .",
    "thus one expects that the proximity effect in a ferromagnet should be very short ranged .",
    "indeed , it has been predicted @xcite that andreev reflections are suppressed due to the fact that impinging electrons and reflected holes occupy bands with different spin orientations .",
    "surprisingly , some of the experiments seem to be in contradiction with the short range nature of the proximity effect . for instance , it was found @xcite that the transition temperature @xmath4 of the @xmath2/@xmath3 multilayers oscillates as a function of the @xmath2 thickness .",
    "this curious behavior has been attributed to the formation of an effective @xmath0-junction @xcite .    in general",
    "a system is in the @xmath0-phase if the @xmath3 order parameter changes its sign across the junction .",
    "the @xmath0-junction behavior has been extensively studied in connection with the high-@xmath4 superconductors @xcite , where @xmath3 order parameter changes its sign under @xmath5 rotation .",
    "this has tremendous consequences as it leads to the zero energy andreev states @xcite , zero bias conductance peaks , paramagnetic meissner effect and spontaneously generated currents .",
    "some other experiments show oscillatory behavior of the @xmath4 , even though a @xmath0-junction can not be realized in the geometry investigated .",
    "the example is a @xmath2/@xmath3/@xmath2 trilayer @xcite , where only one @xmath3 layer is present .",
    "recently oscillations of the density of states with @xmath2 thickness in a @xmath2/@xmath3 bilayer has been also observed @xcite .",
    "evidently a conventional @xmath0-junction is also impossible in this case .",
    "interestingly , such unusual behavior can be explained in terms of a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( @xmath6 ) - like state @xcite , forming in the proximity conditions .",
    "usually , when the exchange field is increased , one would expect that either the field is too weak to break cooper pairs or it leads through first order phase transition to the normal state .",
    "however as it was noted in @xcite , for certain values of the exchange field a new superconducting state can be realized .",
    "this @xmath6 state features a spatially dependent order parameter and the current flow in the ground state .",
    "the total current consists of two contributions : one , which is due to the normal unpaired electrons and the other one , which is a supercurrent .",
    "these two parts cancel each other , so the bloch theorem : no current in the ground state , is satisfied .    similarly in the @xmath2/@xmath3 heterostructures :",
    "the oscillations of the pairing amplitude have been predicted @xcite-@xcite as well as spontaneously generated current in the ground state @xcite .",
    "these features give a strong evidence that the @xmath6 state is really realized in @xmath2/@xmath3 nanostructures .    in the present paper",
    "we attempt to provide further insights into the physics of @xmath6 state in @xmath2/@xmath3 heterostructures .",
    "in particular we investigate the properties of the andreev bound states , pairing amplitude and the spontaneous current when the temperature is varied .",
    "we suggest that temperature measurements of various experimentally accessible quantities can contribute much to the understanding of the superconductivity in @xmath2/@xmath3 bilayers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the section [ sec2 ] we introduce a simple model which can handle the main properties of @xmath2/@xmath3 systems . some technical details concerning numerical implementation can be found in a subsequent paper @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] the nature of the andreev bound states is discussed .",
    "we also show calculated temperature dependences of various quantities characterizing our system .",
    "in particular the density of states , which can be measured experimentally , can unambiguously confirm the current flowing in the ground state .",
    "finally , the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "to study the properties of @xmath2/@xmath3 system we have adopted the @xmath7 hubbard model featuring the exchange splitting in the ferromagnet and an electron - electron attraction in superconductor .",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath8 c^+_{i\\sigma } c_{j\\sigma } +    \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i\\sigma } u_i n_{i\\sigma } n_{i-\\sigma }   \\label{hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the presence of a vector potential @xmath9 , the hopping integral is given by @xmath10 for nearest neighbor lattice sites , whose positions are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and zero otherwise .",
    "the exchange splitting @xmath13 is only non - zero on the @xmath2 side , unlike as @xmath14 ( electron - electron attraction ) being non - zero only in @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath15 is the chemical potential , @xmath16 , ( @xmath17 ) are the usual electron creation ( annihilation ) operators and @xmath18 .    in the following",
    "we shall work within spin - polarized - hartree - fock - gorkov ( @xmath19 ) approximation @xcite assuming periodicity in the direction parallel to the interface while working in a real space in the direction perpendicular .",
    "labelling the layers by integer @xmath20 and @xmath21 at each @xmath22 point of the brillouin zone we shall solve the following @xmath19 equation : @xmath23 where the only non - zero elements are : @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the upper and lower sign respectively , @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 replaced by @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 is corresponding green s function ( @xmath32 ) .    as usual ,",
    "the self - consistency is assured by the relations determining the @xmath2 ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath34 ) order parameters , current ( @xmath35 ) and the vector potential ( @xmath36 ) respectively : @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 the details of the calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "since we have determined the @xmath2 ( [ m ] ) and the @xmath3 ( [ delta ] ) order parameters on both sides of the interface fully self - consistently , we were able to study both @xmath2 and @xmath3 proximity effects .",
    "the @xmath2 order parameter ( spin polarization ) shows the usual meissner - like behavior in the @xmath3 @xcite , while the @xmath3 pairing amplitude oscillates as we increase the thickness of the @xmath2 slab @xcite-@xcite .",
    "similar oscillations are found if we fix the thickness of the @xmath2 sample and change the exchange splitting @xcite .",
    "so this is the first confirmation of the @xmath6 state in @xmath2/@xmath3 heterostructures @xcite .",
    "the interesting physics of such proximity structures is the formation of the andreev bound states @xcite .",
    "they are ` particle in a box ' like states due to the finite thickness of the @xmath2 and have been discussed extensively @xcite . for a normal metal in contact with superconductor these states are symmetrically located with the respect to the fermi energy @xmath41 .",
    "when the normal metal is replaced by ferromagnet the position of these states is shifted due to the exchange splitting in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this gives a possibility to shift such state to the zero energy ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "of course we should talk about andreev bands rather than single states because in the @xmath7 system we are studying , there are the andreev reflections for different angles with respect to the normal to the interface . in such a situation",
    "when the pairing amplitude at the end of the @xmath2 slab ( @xmath2/vacuum interface ) is equal to zero , spontaneous current is generated @xcite .",
    "the current flowing in the system produces a magnetic field , which splits this zero energy state thereby lowering the total energy of the system .",
    "if we follow the position of one particular state , forming an andreev band , as the exchange splitting is increased , there is an additional ( doppler ) shift when the current flows .",
    "the situation is schematically shown in the fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . in @xmath42 or @xmath43",
    "geometry the whole andreev band is split .",
    "the energy of such doppler splitting is determined by the vector potential and in our model is given by @xmath44 , where the layer averaged vector potential is given by @xmath45 for @xmath46 layers .",
    "the splitting of the andreev bands due to the current flowing can be seen if we plot the surface ( @xmath2/vacuum ) density of states at the fermi energy ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this quantity can be directly measured experimentally using planar tunneling spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the example of @xmath47 is shown in the fig .",
    "there is a dramatic difference between solution with or without the current ( in the later case the spontaneous current is constrained to be zero ) . in calculations",
    "it is readily ascertained but experimentally it would be very difficult to judge if there is a current or not .",
    "however a plot of the temperature dependence of the @xmath47 for fixed thickness clearly delineates this difference . at the thicknesses of @xmath2",
    "for which the current flows there is a huge drop in the @xmath47 at characteristic temperature @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are coherence length and penetration depth respectively .",
    "@xmath51 simply indicates the temperature at which magnetic instability , which leads to the generation of the current , takes the place .",
    "such behavior is depicted in the fig .",
    "[ f3 ] and should be observable experimentally .",
    "if there is no current the @xmath52 is due to the andreev band and is almost constant ( we are well below @xmath4 ) , and as soon as the current starts to flow the andreev band splits so we observe a drop in @xmath47 .",
    "the important point is that @xmath51 and @xmath4 are different temperatures .",
    "as we already mentioned , the spontaneous current generates the magnetic field , which can also be measured experimentally by @xmath53 techniques . such spontaneous magnetic flux per unit area in the @xmath54 direction , parallel to the interface ,",
    "is defined by @xmath55 and is shown in the fig .",
    "[ f4 ] as a function of the thickness of the @xmath2 sample .",
    "we see that @xmath56 is larger when @xmath2 thickness is smaller and is of order of @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the flux quantum .",
    "moreover it seems to show an exponential decay with increasing of the number of @xmath2 layers .",
    "similarly , in this case temperature measurement can provide information on the existence of the spontaneous current .",
    "[ f5 ] shows spontaneous magnetic flux for a number of thicknesses of the @xmath2 slab .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the behavior of @xmath56 recalls the temperature dependence of the @xmath3 order parameter in the @xmath59 theory .    before closing the present discussion",
    "the following remark concerning the ferromagnet itself is in order . in general",
    "we should take into account the effect of the magnetic field coming from the localized moments of ferromagnet .",
    "these produce magnetic flux as well as surface currents .",
    "this effect could be important when the magnetization is perpendicular to the interface , as in our case .",
    "however if we deal with the weak ferromagnet or the sample has short lattice constant , the magnetic flux generated by local moments is much smaller than spontaneous one , and we can neglect this effect . in the present calculations we have taken the exchange splitting @xmath60 , so this effect is of minor importance .",
    "in conclusion we have studied properties of the ferromagnet - superconductor bilayer . we have shown that such a structure supports andreev bound states forming andreev bands , the position of which can be tuned by thickness of the @xmath2 sample . when a band crosses the fermi energy , spontaneous current and magnetic flux is generated .",
    "we have found that the state with the current flowing can be experimentally detected measuring the temperature dependence of the density of states or the magnetic flux .",
    "we have argued that such current carrying state is a realization of the @xmath6 state in @xmath2/@xmath3 proximity system .",
