    "collective spin dynamics in dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) is an active field under intense investigations.@xcite this field provides an insight into the origins of carrier - induced ferromagnetism in semiconductors @xcite and an understanding of particular features of the dms @xcite due to the presence of two spin sub - systems that are dynamically coupled via coulomb - exchange interaction : that of the itinerant carrier and that of the localized magnetic impurities . as an example of these features , the transverse spin excitation spectrum has been theoretically found to be composed of three types of excitations .",
    "these are : two collective excitations corresponding to itinerant and localized spins precessing in phase or out of phase to each other , and single - particle ( or stoner - like ) excitations of the itinerant carriers.@xcite the in - phase collective mode is the goldstone - like mode .",
    "the out of phase mode has a dominant contribution from the itinerant carrier subsystem.@xcite experimental evidences of the entire spectrum in ferromagnetic dms like gamnas is not available .",
    "reported so far are features related to the zone - center in phase mode , dominated by the mn spin precession , its dynamics@xcite and its ferromagnetic resonance.@xcite we find no experimental data available for the out of phase mode .",
    "indeed , ferromagnetism in gamnas systems requires a high mn concentration , which destroys the quality of the crystal potential and smooths out all optical resonances .    to gain more insight into the dms spin excitation spectrum , cd@xmath0mn@xmath1te doped quantum wells are a very good alternative as they are clean and efficient to capture the general properties of the collective spin dynamics in dms materials .",
    "the high quality of cd@xmath0mn@xmath1te quantum well structures leads to a high mobility of the itinerant gas ( electrons or holes ) together with well - defined optical resonances,@xcite an important condition for the observation of electronic raman signals from the carrier subsystem .",
    "@xcite the presence of mn impurities interacting with the two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) embedded in the cd@xmath0mn@xmath1te quantum well , thus , provides interest on two levels .",
    "first , the static mean - field _ s - d _ contribution from the mn ions produces a large zeeman splitting : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the overhauser shift due to the mn spin polarization and @xmath4 is the normal zeeman splitting of the conduction band ( here @xmath5 for @xmath6 ) .",
    "this leads to a high spin polarization degree @xmath7 in the 2deg.@xcite it makes it a suitable system to study features of spin - resolved coulomb interaction.@xcite the above approach was followed in our previous work to study spin excitations of the spin - polarized 2deg ( sp2deg).@xcite .",
    "propagative spin flip waves ( sfw ) of electrons were observed @xcite and their appearance was linked to the coulomb interaction between electrons.@xcite on a second level , it provides evidence of the mixing between electrons and mn spin modes in the frequency@xcite and time@xcite domains as predicted in ref.@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a connection between these manifestations needs to be made : in the first approach , _ s - d _ dynamical coupling with the mn was neglected , while in the second , coulomb interaction between electrons did not manifest experimentally and was not taken into account in theories of ref.@xcite .",
    "there is , therefore , a lack of full understanding of the mixed spin - excitations where both coulomb interactions between electrons and the _ s - d _ dynamical coupling with mn spins interplay .",
    "moreover , in the later studies,@xcite only the zone center collective electron - mn modes were probed . from the larmor s",
    "theorem,@xcite it is known that the spin system behaves as if the electrons were not interacting through coulomb .",
    "this explains why theories describing the electron - mn modes , without the coulomb interaction between carriers,@xcite agree well with the experimental data of ref.@xcite . out of zone center",
    ", predictions of ref.@xcite , found the out of phase mode ( so - called stiff mode ) to have a positive dispersion above the stoner continuum .",
    "however , we have shown by angle - resolved raman measurements that the collective electron spin mode ( sfw mode ) , was below the spin - flip single - particle excitations ( sf - spe)@xcite , together with a negative slope dispersion with the raman transferred in plane momentum @xmath8.@xcite it is natural to make the correspondence between the stiff mode of ref.@xcite and the sfw mode of refs.@xcite and @xcite ( stoner - like excitations are obviously the sf - spe )",
    ". therefore , our experimental observations are in contradiction with the theory of ref.@xcite .    in the following",
    "we will use the denomination `` out of phase mode '' or opm to describe a mode which coincides with the stiff mode when the coulomb interaction between carriers is neglected or to the sfw mode when the _ s - d _ dynamical coupling with mn spins is neglected .    in this work ,",
    "we want to resolve this contradiction , by first showing new experimental data that clearly shows the sf - spe continuum and that the opm propagates below it with a negative dispersion .",
    "secondly , we will introduce a new propagator for the electron - mn collective modes that includes the coulomb interaction between spin - polarized carriers .",
    "finally , we justify the experimental features by comparing the _ s - d _ exchange dynamical correction due to the coupling of the electron and mn spin precession with the correction introduced by the coulomb interaction between carriers .",
    "we will demonstrate that the ratio of these two corrections does not depend , at standard conditions , on the mn concentration and that the coulomb correction always dominates over the _ s - d _ dynamical shift except for very large electron densities .",
    "our measurements were made in the back scattering geometry on a cd@xmath0mn@xmath9te single quantum well with electron densities @xmath10 ranging from @xmath11 @xmath12 to @xmath13 @xmath12 and an effective mn@xmath14 concentration @xmath15 ranging from @xmath16 to @xmath17.@xcite the quantum wells were grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a gaas substrate.@xcite these quantum wells and their spin polarizations have been characterized in our previous publication.@xcite here we will consider samples a and b of that reference .",
    "both a and b have a density of @xmath18 @xmath12 and different mn concentrations , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "measurements were taken with the samples immersed in superfluid helium at @xmath21 k inside a superconducting magnetic cryostat .",
    "the essential part of the cryostat is in the rod holding the sample , which allows for control in three directions , including rotation of the sample in the plane of the magnetic field for dispersions while the collection / reflection mirror was kept fixed .",
    "this design aids in an easy study of the raman scattering dispersions with an accuracy of 1 degree ( @xmath22 @xmath23 ) . to determine the in - plane wave vector @xmath8 transferred in the plane of the quantum",

    "a tunable cw ti - sapphire laser , pumped by an ar@xmath27 laser was used as light source .",

    "all spectra are dominated by a sharp - peaked line associated with the collective sfw as already demonstrated in ref.@xcite .",
    "we will show in the following that this mode is exactly the out of phase electron - mn mode ( the stiff mode of ref.@xcite ) of the dms system .",
    "the sfw mode is narrow in width compared to the other excitations in the spectra and is found to be intense at all magnetic fields .",
    "as @xmath8 is increased , the intensity and energy of the sfw decreases and eventually diminishes at a critical wave vector , @xmath36.@xcite the linewidth of the sfw broadens with increasing @xmath8 , damping out due to interactions with the sf - spe continuum.@xcite    at high energies , features of the sf - spe are observed in the spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "these features emerge as the magnetic field is increased , showing a fan - shaped like behavior at large @xmath8 values leading to a continuum .",
    "this continuum corresponds to the joint density of state of electron - hole pairs in the fermi sea which has a characteristic double - peak structure.@xcite in the following , we have labeled the maxima positions of the sf - spe continuum as spe1 and spe2 . in the long wavelength limit ,",
    "spe1 and spe2 peaks are close to @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fermi velocity of the minority spin subband and @xmath39 is the renormalized zeeman energy.@xcite spe1 and spe2 are degenerate at @xmath40 forming a single peaked structure positioned at @xmath39.@xcite at small wavevectors , a clear distinction between spe1 and spe2 is difficult as these features overlap .",
    "spe1 shifts to low energies , decreasing in intensity and eventually vanishing as @xmath8 is increased .",

    "the experimental spectra are neither given by the collective response , nor the single - particle one , but by a mixing of both responses .",
    "this is a consequence of the optical resonance with the incoming raman photon.@xcite    ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "these , respectively , correspond to spin polarization values @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "experimental data are compared with calculations : the dashed domain is the sf - spe continuum , edges of the domain are given for @xmath44 k. the lines inside the domain ( when available ) are the peaks of the single particle response [ see fig .",

    "evidence is given that this experimental mode is the opm ( or stiff mode of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "consequently , our observations are in contradiction to this theory which predicted that the dynamical _ s - d _ exchange interaction between the mn ions and the electrons shifts the opm above the sf - spe continuum with a positive dispersion . to resolve this contradiction ,",

    "the mn precession frequency is determined by the zeeman energy of the mn ( @xmath79 ) , the static mean - field _ s - d _ contribution from electrons ( @xmath76 ) , and the third term is the `` dynamical '' knight shift that originates from the electron precession itself responding ( through the @xmath80 response ) to the mn magnetic field ( proportional to @xmath75 ) . at @xmath40 , @xmath81 , collective modes of eq.([eqcoulomb ] ) develop two modes : @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",

    "`` mn - like '' ) , because it is mainly dominated by the electron ( resp .",
    "mn ) spin precession . in resonance ( @xmath89 ) modes have a complete mixed character .",
    "these zone center modes were observed in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite .",
    "the resonance field depends mainly on the mn concentration and for the experimental situation of fig.[fig : disper ] , it is about 10.7 t. figure [ fig : disper ] compares the dispersion of the opm @xmath90 , calculated using eq.([eqcoulomb ] ) and the parameters of sample a , with the experimental one . undoubtedly , the agreement with the data is excellent without any fitting procedure .",
    "the dispersion of the sfw mode @xmath91 defined as the unique pole of @xmath92 is also plotted .",
    "it appears that the introduction of the _ s - d _ dynamical coupling shifts @xmath90 negligibly from the pure electron mode @xmath93 for that situation .",
    "however , the inclusion of the coulomb interaction in eq.([eqcoulomb ] ) positions the opm below the sf - spe continuum with a negative dispersion , contrary to what was found in ref.@xcite .",

    "thus , for no coulomb interaction between electrons , the pure electron modes are the sf - spe ( poles of the single - particle response ) degenerate to @xmath97 at @xmath40 .",
