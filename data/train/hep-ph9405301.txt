    "we consider the coupling of scalar as well as pseudoscalar higgs bosons to two photons .",

    "we should note that non  perturbative qcd effects are very important for the bound  state formation , but due to the large width of the top quark they are suppressed in the production of a @xmath25 system [ the relative correction being less than 1% ] . in this paper",
    "we take into account the finite width @xmath43 of the top quark and coulomb interaction effects in the threshold region .",
