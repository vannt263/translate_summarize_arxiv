    "there are already many interesting results and open questions about differences between prime numbers ; a seminal and inspirational work about differences between primes is hardy and littlewood s 1923 paper @xcite .",
    "a number @xmath12 is a _ gap _ between prime numbers if it is the difference between consecutive primes ; that is , @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "differences of length @xmath0 or @xmath16 are also gaps ; so open questions like the twin prime conjecture , that there are an infinite number of gaps @xmath17 , can be formulated as questions about differences as well .    a _ constellation among primes _",
    "@xcite is a sequence of consecutive gaps between prime numbers .",
    "let @xmath18 be a sequence of @xmath19 numbers .",
    "then @xmath20 is a constellation among primes if there exists a sequence of @xmath21 consecutive prime numbers @xmath22 such that for each @xmath23 , we have the gap @xmath24 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath20 is a constellation if for some @xmath25 and all @xmath23 , @xmath26 .",
    "we will write the constellations without marking a separation between single - digit gaps .",
    "for example , a constellation of @xmath27 denotes a gap of @xmath17 followed immediately by a gap @xmath28 . for the small primes we will consider explicitly , most of these gaps are single digits , and the separators introduce a lot of visual clutter .",
    "we use commas only to separate double - digit gaps in the cycle .",
    "for example , a constellation of @xmath29 denotes a gap of @xmath0 followed by a gap of @xmath30 , followed by another gap of @xmath0 .",
    "in @xcite we introduced a recursion that works directly on the gaps among the generators in each stage of eratosthenes sieve .",
    "these are the generators of @xmath31 in which @xmath32 is the product of the prime numbers from @xmath0 through @xmath9 , known as the _ primorial _ of @xmath9 . for a constellation @xmath20 ,",
    "this recursion enables us to enumerate exactly how many copies of @xmath20 occur in the @xmath3 stage of the sieve .",
    "we denote this number of copies of @xmath20 as @xmath33 .",
    "for example , after the primes @xmath0 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 and their multiples have been removed , we have the cycle of gaps @xmath36 .",
    "this cycle of @xmath37 gaps sums to @xmath2 . in this cycle , for the constellation @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 . for the constellation @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 .",
    "the cycle of gaps @xmath42 has @xmath43 gaps that sum to @xmath32 .",
    "in @xcite we assumed that copies of a constellation were approximately uniformly distributed within the cycle of gaps @xmath44 , from which we could then estimate the numbers of these constellations that survive to occur as constellations among prime numbers .",
    "for a few select constellations we compared our estimates to actual counts up through @xmath45 .",
    "for these constellations , our estimates in @xcite appear to have the correct asymptotic behavior , but our estimates also seem to have a systematic error correlated with the number of gaps in the constellation .    in this paper , we identify a discrete dynamic system that provides exact counts of a gap and its driving terms , which are constellations that under successive closures produce the gap at later stages of the sieve .",
    "these raw counts grow superexponentially , and so to better understand their behavior we take the ratio of a raw count to the number of gaps @xmath46 at each stage of the sieve .    for a gap @xmath12 that has driving terms of lengths @xmath47",
    ", we form a vector of initial values @xmath48 , whose @xmath49 entry is the ratio of the number of driving terms for @xmath12 of length @xmath50 in @xmath51 to the number of gaps @xmath0 in this cycle of gaps . recasting the discrete dynamic system to work with these ratios",
    ", we have @xmath52 the matrix @xmath53 does not depend on the gap @xmath12 .",
    "it does depend on the prime @xmath4 , and we use the exponential notation @xmath54 to indicate the product of the @xmath55 s over the indicated range of primes .",
    "although the matrix @xmath53 depends on the prime @xmath4 , its eigenvectors do not .",
    "we are therefore able to give a simple exact expression of the dynamic system that reveals its asymptotic behavior .",
    "we show that as @xmath56 , the following ratios describe the relative frequency of occurrence of gaps in eratosthenes sieve :       the values @xmath57 are the actual ratios between the numbers of these gaps at the corresponding stage of eratosthenes sieve .",
    "so these ratios , when computed exactly , represent the exact proportions of the relative occurrences among these gaps .",
    "if there are significant deviations from these ratios among gaps in the cycle compared to the ratios of those that survive to be gaps among primes over this range , what can we understand about the mechanism that would selectively close gaps of certain values ?    this column @xmath58 provides the ratios in @xmath59 , which covers the interval @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "as the recursion continues , many closures will occur within this range .",
    "the final column @xmath62 provides the asymptotic ratios of the occurrences of the indicated gap to the occurrences of the gap @xmath0 .    to understand the convergence to @xmath62 , from the eigenstructure of @xmath54 we can approximate @xmath63 by truncating : @xmath64 note that for @xmath59 the value of @xmath65 , so the convergence to @xmath66 is very gradual .",
    "this work supports the conjecture that @xmath2 eventually is a more common gap among primes than @xmath1 . in the table above , we see that asymptotically there are in the cycles of gaps for eratosthenes sieve twice as many @xmath1 s as @xmath0 s and @xmath67 times as many @xmath2 s as @xmath0 s . however , even at the prime @xmath68 , these ratios are @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "truncating @xmath63 as suggested and using the initial conditions for @xmath71 and @xmath72 in @xmath73 , we see that @xmath2 s will outnumber @xmath1 s in eratosthenes sieve when @xmath74 .",
    "the asymptotic ratios appear to follow the formula : @xmath75{}}q>2 } \\frac{q-1}{q-2}.\\ ] ] it would be interesting to see whether this formula holds up for larger gaps , since it provides supporting evidence for conjecture b in @xcite ; these ratios among gaps hold asymptotically in eratosthenes sieve . from lemma  [ asymlemma ] this means that for a given set of prime factors ( no matter what the powers on these factors ) , any gap with this same set of prime factors has the same total number of driving terms in any stage of eratosthenes sieve that satisfies the conditions of theorem  [ countthm ] .    one more observation about primorial gaps and their driving terms .",
    "since the length of @xmath76 is @xmath37 with sum @xmath2 , in all subsequent cycles of gaps the sum of every constellation of length @xmath37 will be at least @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath77 , there are @xmath78 complete copies of @xmath76 in @xmath73 .",
    "complete copies are only preserved for @xmath76 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "these are preserved since the elementwise products in step r3 of the recursion are large enough to pass completely over one of the copies concatenated in step r2 . starting with @xmath81 ,",
    "the primorial @xmath82 is larger than any of the elementwise products , and no complete copies of these longer cycles are preserved in their entirety ."
