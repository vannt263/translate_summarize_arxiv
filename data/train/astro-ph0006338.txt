    "the continuing spectroscopic study of central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspn ) is motivated by two observational facts which reveal our incomplete understanding of post - agb stellar evolution .",
    "the first concerns the mere existence of hydrogen - deficient objects which comprise the spectroscopic types [ wc ] and pg1159 .",
    "the second concerns the apparent lack of hydrogen - rich cspn at the hot end of the white dwarf cooling sequence , suggesting that during this stage all h - rich objects become h - deficient .",
    "the first problem initialized an almost complete analysis of all known h - deficient post - agb stars , resulting in accurate determinations of the effective temperature ( @xmath0 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath17 ) , as well as the abundance of the main atmospheric constituents ( he , c , o ) and in some cases trace of elements ( h , n , ne ) . the second problem could be solved by the systematic search for white dwarf central stars .",
    "subsequent analyses of the h - rich objects revealed @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and h : he ratio and the results complement the analyses of other h - rich cspn performed in numerous previous analyses ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : references ] ) .",
    "almost no effort has been yet made to analyze metal abundances in the h - rich cspn .",
    "interesting insight into agb evolutionary phases may be gained by such analyses , because obvious abundance anomalies exist among stars with otherwise similar atmospheric parameters @xcite . before embarking on such a project and discussing the abundance patterns it is reasonable to obtain information about the primordial metallicity of these objects by analyzing their iron abundance .",
    "the reason herefore is that iron is not affected by nuclear processes during previous evolutionary phases .",
    "such an analysis requires uv spectroscopy . as a first step it is mandatory to check , if the iue final archive contains useful data .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to exploit that archive exhaustively in order to identify and analyze quantitatively iron lines in hot central stars .",
    ".references in tab .",
    "[ tab : objects ] [ cols=\"^,<,^ , < \" , ]",
    "our sample selection started from a cspn compilation by @xcite and we complemented his list of h - rich objects by several objects dealt with in the more recent literature ( e.g. see tab .  [",
    "tab : references ] ) . for these stars we checked the iue archive for high resolution swp spectra and found data for 27 h - rich cspn . from this sample",
    "those objects were excluded , which have high mass - loss rates , i.e. , those showing of - type optical spectra and those with extraordinarily strong p  cygni resonance line profiles in the uv . thereby the final sample consisted of ten stars , which can be analyzed reliably with our static model atmospheres .",
    "all program stars have @xmath0 70000k .",
    "[ fig : tracks ] shows their position in the @xmath18-diagram and tab .",
    "[ tab : objects ] summarizes their atmospheric parameters .",
    "the swp spectra were extracted from the iue final archive and subject to several reduction steps before comparison with model spectra .",
    "these steps comprise the assembly of single echelle orders in order to obtain a complete spectrum in the 1200  1600  range ; elimination of the strongest interstellar absorption lines by voigt profile fitting ( ly@xmath19 and lines ) ; correction for radial velocity ; normalization of the spectra .",
    "the last step is rather delicate .",
    "firstly the ripple correction for the echelle orders in the archival data is far from being perfect ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : continuum ] ) and has to be corrected .",
    "secondly , fixing the continuum is a rather subjective procedure and thus the major error source for the quantitative analysis , because of the generally high noise level in the spectra . to determine the continuum we smoothed the spectrum with a median filter of 2  width , followed by a convolution with a gaussian profile of 2  fwhm .",
    "this method is inapplicable in regions with p  cygni profiles and the continuum has to be determined manually .",
    "furthermore the determined continuum around deep ism lines is too low and has to be raised manually .",
    "we have calculated a grid of plane - parallel non - lte model atmospheres ( fig .",
    "[ fig : grid ] ) in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the computer code is based on the accelerated lambda iteration method @xcite and it can handle the line blanketing of iron group elements by a statistical approach using superlevels and superlines with an opacity sampling technique @xcite . the latest version of the code and a detailed description of the numerical method can be found in @xcite .",
    "our model atmospheres include the cno elements as well as iron and nickel self - consistently , i.e.  their back - reaction on the atmospheric structure is accounted for .",
    "in essence , they are very similar to the models described in detail by @xcite , so we restrict ourselves here to a summary of the model atoms in tab .",
    "[ tab : atoms ] .",
    "the main extension of that models refers to a detailed model atom for .",
    "this turned out to be essential in order to reliably compute lines , because the relative occupation of both ionization stages sensitively depends on the detailed treatment of their respective level populations via ionization and recombination processes .",
    "as an example , the iron ionization structure in a typical model atmosphere is shown in fig .",

    "lines have been detected in other central stars and sdo stars by @xcite , however , these stars have effective temperatures which are lower than those of our objects .",
    "for three high - gravity objects in the sample the suspected iron deficiency may be the result of gravitational settling .",
    "for the other stars of the sample with low gravity and high luminosity another explanation must be found since mass loss efficiently suppresses gravitational settling @xcite . following suggestions in the literature",
    "@xcite , the iron abundance in these stars might not be primordial , but the result of chemical fractionation through dust formation and subsequent loss due to stellar wind during previous agb phases .",
    "therefore improved spectroscopy either by fuse or hst is necessary to confirm or reject the possibility of a general fe deficiency in these central stars .",
    "furthermore , the determination of the abundance of cno - elements is desirable in order to get a better understanding of the chemical evolution of these stars .",
    "our study suggests that iron is not necessarily a suitable tracer to determine the primordial metallicity .",
    "alternatively one may use the s or zn abundance to obtain reliable information @xcite .",
    "the abundance of both elements is not affected by nuclear processes during previous evolutionary phases and both elements do not tend to dust formation as iron does @xcite . due to the lack of detailed atomic data for zn , one has to concentrate on the s lines in the fuv and uv region .",
