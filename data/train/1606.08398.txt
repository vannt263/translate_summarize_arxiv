    "the local violation @xcite of discrete symmetries in strongly interacting qcd matter is entering a new important phase of its investigation .",
    "it started from chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) @xcite which uses the ( c)p - violating ( electro)magnetic field generated in heavy ion collisions in order to probe the ( c)p - odd effects in qcd matter .",
    "current development is related to counterpart of this effect , chiral vortical effect ( cve)@xcite due to coupling to p - odd medium vorticity leading to the induced electromagnetic and all conserved - charge currents @xcite , in particular the baryonic one .",
    "what became most important now is that p - odd effects might be observable as baryon polarization . a mechanism analogous to cve ( known as axial vortical effect , see @xcite and references therein ) leads to an induced axial current of strange quarks which may be converted to polarization of @xmath0-hyperons @xcite .",
    "another mechanism of this polarization is provided by so - called thermal vorticity in the hydrodynamical approach @xcite .",
    "recently pioneering preliminary results on global polarization of @xmath0 and @xmath2 hyperons in peripheral @xmath1 collisions in the rhic beam energy scan were released @xcite showing a decrease of polarization with increasing energy in qualitative agreement with the prediction of ref.@xcite . here",
    ", we address this issue and explore the relevant details of theoretical description . the decrease with energy",
    "is shown to be related to the suppression of the axial magnetic effect contribution in strongly correlated qcd matter found in lattice simulations .",
    "consequently , accurate measurements of polarization energy dependence may serve as a sensitive probe of strongly correlated qcd matter .",
    "we consider hyperon polarization as the observable related to vorticity and helicity @xcite .",
    "we shall concentrate mostly on @xmath3 hyperons , which are produced in large numbers and their polarization may be easily recovered from the angular distributions of their weak decays products .",
    "these advantages are important in the current star measurements @xcite .",
    "we explore the mechanism of generation of axial current similar to the famous axial anomaly . in the medium described by a chemical potential @xmath4",
    "there is a contribution to the interaction lagrangian @xcite proportional to the appropriate conserved charge density in the medium rest frame @xmath5 : @xmath6 the lorentz covariance allows one to transform this expression using the hydrodynamical four - velocity @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the lorentz factor : @xmath9 here , the velocity @xmath10 and the chemical potential @xmath4 play the role of the gauge field @xmath11 and the corresponding coupling @xmath12 , respectively : @xmath13 this substitution can be applied to any diagram with the lines of external ( classical ) gauge fields leading to various medium effects . in the case of the famous anomalous triangle diagram ( fig.1 ) it leads to the induced ( classical ) axial current .",
    "[ height=0.5 ] fig1a.pdf    this effect is quite similar to the anomalous gluon contribution to the nucleon spin ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the role of the gauge gluon field is played by the velocity field while the longitudinal polarization ( helicity ) of gluons corresponds , as we will see below , to the hydrodynamic helicity .",
    "note that for massive quarks the anomalous contribution is partially compensated by the `` normal '' one ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for a heavy quark axial current @xmath14 the resulting matrix element between momentum eigenstates may be expanded to inverse powers of the quark mass @xmath15 @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 are polarization vectors of these eigenstates and @xmath18 is the number of colors . as far as the @xmath19 wave function of @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "quarks form the spin singlet , we assume that @xmath0 spin is carried predominantly by the strange quark .",
    "the strange quark may be considered as both light ( with respect to the nucleon mass ) and heavy ( with respect to intrinsic higher twist scale ) @xcite .",
    "when the transition to coordinate space is performed , the fourier transform of the corresponding matrix elements ( requiring , generally speaking , the knowledge of the anomaly graph at arbitrary external momenta @xcite ) should contribute to the classical axial current .",
    "we do not expect that these corrections could change the scale of the effect substantially .",
    "let us therefore consider the classical strange axial charge @xcite @xmath22 induced by the anomalous triangle diagram ( fig .",
    ", we keep actually only the first term in the chiral vorticity coefficient @xmath23 since we assume that the chiral chemical potential @xmath24 is much smaller than the strange one @xmath25 . the temperature dependent term in eq . ( [ cv ] ) ,",
    "related to the gravitational anomaly @xcite , can naively be considered to be quite substantial . however , lattice simulations @xcite lead to a zero result in the confined phase and to suppression by one order of magnitude at high temperatures .",
    "as far as for free fermion gas the @xmath26 term is recovered @xcite for large lattice volume at fixed temperature , the above - mentioned suppression should be attributed to the correlation effects .    in order to relate the strange axial charge @xmath27 ( [ q5s ] ) to hydrodynamical quantities one can use the mean - value theorem to evaluate it @xcite : @xmath28 where hydrodynamical helicity @xmath29 is the integrated projection of the velocity @xmath30 to the vorticity @xmath31 .    note that the hydrodynamic helicity is related to the zeroth component ( @xmath32 ) of the four - current @xmath33 coming back to the similarity with the spin crisis , this is the analog of the topological current , related @xcite ( in the axial gauge ) to the gluon polarization .",
    "the space components of ( [ k ] ) for slow enough fields in the non - relativistic approximation are related to the vorticity vector : @xmath34 while the exact relation involves relativistic corrections .",
    "to avoid such complications , here we discuss the complementary approach @xcite relying on the @xmath35 , helicity and axial charge .",
    "to pass from the classical charge ( we are always dealing with ) to the quantum matrix elements we will use the analogy with the conserved current case when the conserved charge @xmath36 appears in the symmetric one - particle matrix elements of the current @xmath37 to calculate the ( quantum ) average charge per particle resulting from the latter equation it is sufficient to divide the total _ classical _",
    "charge by particles number @xmath38 : @xmath39 passing now to the axial charge case , let us note that the symmetric matrix element of quark axial current of the flavor @xmath40 is related to the fraction @xmath41 of a hadron covariant polarization @xmath42 carried by that quark : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a hadron @xmath40 mass . by analogy with ( [ clq][clq1 ] ) , the axial charge should correspond to @xmath45 the average polarization is then @xmath46    in what follows we will consider all @xmath38 particles to be @xmath47 and put @xmath48 assuming ( following the above - mentioned @xmath19 based arguments ) that strange ( anti)quarks carry all the polarization and considering the @xmath0 mass is large enough with respect to its momentum .",
    "the latter assumption is a reasonable approximation at the nica energies ( @xmath49 ) and will provide a lower bound estimate of the polarization .    the helicity shows the phenomenon of separation @xcite so that its sign is changed at the two sides of the reaction plane . as a result , the axial charge and the zeroth component of the hyperon polarization also manifest such a phenomenon of sign change .    as the axial charge is related to the zeroth component of the hyperon polarization in the laboratory frame @xmath50 , the transformation to hyperon rest frame",
    "must be performed @xcite .",
    "taking into account that the polarization pseudovector should be directed along the @xmath51axis transverse to the reaction plane ( as it has to be collinear to the angular momentum pseudovector ) , one gets for the components of the laboratory frame polarization @xmath52 one can use both its time @xmath53 and space @xmath54 components to recover the polarization in the hyperon rest frame . note that for the time component the factor @xmath55 changes sign at two sides of reaction plane compensating the sign change due to helicity separation .",
    "at the same time , that factor is absent for space component .",
    "as we discussed above , this component is related to the vorticity rather than helicity and should not show the sign change .",
    "therefore , the use of either time or space component of @xmath53 should lead to equal polarization at both sides of the reaction plane . leaving the exploration of space component for future work we use the time component and get : @xmath56    the appearance of @xmath55 in the denominator is not dangerous , as the particles with zero transverse momentum",
    "do not have also the time component of polarization .",
    "the average polarization was firstly roughly estimated just by dividing @xmath27 ( [ mean1 ] ) by the number of @xmath0 leading @xcite to a value of about @xmath57 , later confirmed @xcite by more detailed simulations , which are compatible with the current star data @xcite .",
    "the appearance of @xmath58 in eqs .",
    "( [ q5s ] ) and ( [ ratio ] ) , related to the positive c - parity of axial current , immediately leads to the same expressions for axial charge of strange quarks and antiquarks .",
    "as far as there is a smaller number of @xmath2s than of @xmath0s , so that the same axial charge should be distributed among smaller number of antiquarks comparing with the number of quarks , the corresponding factor in the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) is smaller for @xmath59s , which results in an increase of the effect for the latter .",
    "thus , one could expect that the polarization of @xmath2 has to be of the same sign but of a larger magnitude than the polarization of @xmath0 , which is compatible with the quite recent star data @xcite .",
    "this effect might be partly compensated by the fact , that a larger amount of axial charge in the case of strange antiquarks might be carried by more numerous @xmath60-mesons .",
    "as far as the strange chemical potential is rapidly decreasing with energy , this provides a natural explanation of the observed hint @xcite for decrease of polarization with energy .",
    "more accurate measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath2 polarization at rhic , and at nica and fair in future , might allow one to test the suppression of @xmath61 term and , at best , even to check experimentally the magnitude of its theoretically predicted coefficient and search for possible extra @xcite contributions .",
    "the generation of polarization by the anomalous mechanism ( axial vortical effect ) naturally explains several features of the observed data .    * the decrease of chemical potential with energy leads to the decrease of polarization .",
    "an additional source of decrease is provided by the energy dependence of the helicity which was earlier found @xcite to be maximal in the nica energy range . the contribution related to the gravitational anomaly proportional to @xmath61",
    "may be suppressed in strongly correlated matter . moreover",
    ", the accurate measurements of the energy dependence of polarization should allow to separate the gravitational anomaly contribution and test the degree of its suppression in strongly correlated qcd matter . *",
    "the proportionality of the polarization to the square of the chemical potential related to c - even parity of axial current leads to the same sign of polarization of @xmath0 and @xmath2 hyperons .",
    "the smaller number of the latter should result in a larger fraction of the axial charge corresponding to each anti - hyperon and to a larger absolute value of polarization .",
    "detailed numerical simulations may allow to quantify this prediction .",
    "accurate measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath2 polarization should allow to check these predictions and provide an additional check of the gravitational anomaly related contribution .",
