    "the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles  @xcite , defined as a renormalizable field theory , based on the su(3)@xmath1su(2)@xmath1u(1 ) gauge group , and containing three fermionic families  left - handed particles , su(2 ) doublets , right - handed particles , su(2 ) singlets ( no right - handed neutrinos ) and one higgs doublet  has successfully predicted a number of particles and their properties .",
    "however , there is no doubt that the sm is not a final theory .",
    "indeed , over the past several decades it has become increasingly clear that it fails to explain a number of _ observed _ phenomena in particle physics , astrophysics , and cosmology .",
    "these phenomena _ beyond the sm _ ( bsm ) are    neutrino oscillations ( transition between neutrinos of different flavors ) ,    baryon asymmetry ( excess of matter over anti - matter in the universe ) ,    dark matter ( about 80% of all matter in the universe consisting of unknown particles ) ,    inflation ( a period of rapid accelerated expansion in the early universe ) , and    dark energy ( late - time accelerated expansion of the universe )    this list of _ well - established observational _ drawbacks of the sm is considered complete at present .",
    "all the other bsm problems  for , instance , the gauge hierarchy and strong - cp problems  require theoretical fine - tuning .    at what energies should the sm be superseded by some other , more fundamental theory ?",
    "the existence of gravity with the coupling related to the planck scale  @xmath2 gev , where @xmath3 is the newtonian gravitational constant  implies that the cut - off is _ at least _ below the planck scale .",
    "if the cutoff is identified with @xmath4 , the low - energy lagrangian can contain all sorts of higher - dimensional su(3)@xmath1su(2)@xmath1u(1)-invariant operators that are suppressed by the planck scale , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the lagrangian of the sm .",
    "these operators lead to a number of physical effects that can not be described by the sm , such as neutrino masses and mixings , proton decay , etc .",
    "however , as we will discuss below , even the theory shown in eq .",
    "( [ lagr ] ) does not survive when confronted with different experiments and observations .",
    "alternatively , one can place a cut - off @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ lagr ] ) , which would imply that new physics ( and new particles ) appears well below the planck scale at energies @xmath8 . if @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the mass of the weak @xmath11 boson , the resulting theory suffers from the so - called _ gauge hierarchy problem _ , that is , the problem of quantum stability of the mass of the higgs boson against quantum corrections from heavy particles .    most of the research in bsm physics carried out during the past few decades was devoted to solving the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "many different suggestions were proposed concerning how to achieve the `` naturalness '' of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "these propositions are based on supersymmetry , technicolor , and large extra dimensions , among other ideas .",
    "finding a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem , coupled with the need to solve observational and other fine - tuning problems of the sm , is extremely challenging .",
    "most of the approaches postulate the existence of new particles with masses _ above _ the electroweak scale ( ranging from @xmath12  gev to @xmath13@xmath14  gev ) . as a result ,",
    "the proposed theories contain a plethora of ( not yet observed ) new particles and parameters .    in this review , we describe a conceptually different scenario for bsm physics and its consequences for astrophysics and cosmology in an attempt to address the bsm problems named above _ without _ introducing new energy scales ( that is , in addition to the electroweak and the planck scales ) . in such an approach ,",
    "the hierarchy problem is shifted to the planck scale , and there is no reason to believe that the field theoretical logic is still applicable to it .    below we show ( following refs .",
    "@xcite and a number of subsequent works ) that this goal may be achieved with a very simple extension of the sm .",
    "the only new particles , added to the sm lagrangian are three gauge - singlet fermions ( i.e. , _ sterile neutrinos _ ) with masses _ below _ the electroweak scale .",
    "right - handed neutrinos are strongly motivated by the observation of neutrino flavor oscillations . in section",
    "[ sec : neutr - oscill ] we review neutrino oscillations and introduce the corresponding lagrangian .",
    "we summarize the choice of parameters of the neutrino minimal standard model ( @xmath0msm ) in section  [ sec : phenomenology - numsm ] . in section  [ sec : cosm - early - univ ] , we present a @xmath0msmcosmology .",
    "we discuss the restrictions from astrophysics , cosmology , and particle physics experiments , as well as future searches in section  [ sec : testing - numsm ] . in section",
    "[ sec : beyond ] , we conclude with a discussion of possible extensions of the @xmath0msmand potential astrophysical applications of sterile neutrinos .",
    "when the sm was conceived , neutrinos were thought to be massless and different lepton numbers were believed to be conserved ( which would not be the case if right - handed neutrinos were present ) .",
    "this was a reason for _ not introducing right - handed neutrinos _ decades ago .",
    "transitions between neutrinos of different flavors have been observed .",
    "these _ neutrino oscillations _ manifest themselves in experiments with solar , atmospheric , accelerator and reactor neutrinos .",
    "the subject of neutrino oscillations has received a great deal of attention in recent years and many reviews are available ( see e.g. refs .",
    "the observed oscillations determine the mass differences between propagation states  @xcite @xmath15 and @xmath16 importantly , each of these results was confirmed by two different types of experiments : accelerator  @xcite for eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and reactor  @xcite for eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .    the observed pattern of neutrino oscillations can not be explained by the action eq .",
    "( [ lagr ] ) with the planck - scale cutoff .",
    "indeed , the lowest - order five - dimensional operator @xmath17 leads to the majorana neutrino masses of the order @xmath18 ev , where @xmath19 are left - handed leptonic doublets , the index @xmath20 labels generations , @xmath21 is a higgs doublet with @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the sign of charge conjugation , and @xmath24 gev is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "the fact that the @xmath25 following from this lagrangian is so small compared with the lower bound on neutrino mass arising from the observations of neutrino oscillations ( @xmath26  ev ) rules out the conjecture that the theory shown in eq .",
    "( [ lagr ] ) is a viable effective field theory up to the planck scale .",
    "therefore , _ the existence of neutrino oscillations requires adding new particles to the lagrangian of the standard model .",
    "_    let us add @xmath27 right - handed neutrinos @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the most general renormalizable lagrangian has the form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 are new yukawa couplings .",
    "the right - handed neutrinos have zero electric , weak and strong charges ; therefore , they are often termed `` singlet , '' or `` sterile '' fermions .",
    "the majorana masses @xmath32 are consistent with the gauge symmetries of the sm . without loss of generality , the majorana mass matrix in diagonal form can be chosen .    if the dirac masses @xmath33 are much smaller than the majorana masses @xmath32 , _ the type i seesaw formula _",
    "@xcite holds that @xmath34 where @xmath25 is a @xmath35 matrix of active neutrino masses , mixings , and ( possible ) cp - violating phases .",
    "an elementary analysis of eq .",
    "( [ see - saw ] ) shows that the number of right - handed singlet fermions @xmath27 must be _ at least two _ to fit the data of neutrino oscillations .",
    "if there were only one sterile neutrino , then the two active neutrinos would be massless .",
    "if there were two singlet fermions , only one of the active neutrinos would be massless , which does not contradict the results from experiment .",
    "moreover , in this case there are 11 new parameters in the lagrangian  ( [ lagr1 ] )  two majorana masses , two dirac masses , four mixing angles , and three cp - violating phases  which is more than the number of parameters ( 7 ) describing the mass matrix of active neutrinos with one zero eigenvalue . in other words , for @xmath36 the lagrangian  ( [ lagr1 ] ) can describe the pattern of neutrino masses and mixings observed experimentally . of course , the situation is even more relaxed for @xmath37 .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagr1 ] ) with @xmath38 restores the symmetry between quarks and leptons : every left quark and lepton has a right counterpart .    the seesaw formula  ( [ see - saw ] ) allows the mass of singlet neutrinos to be a free parameter : multiplying @xmath39 by any number @xmath40 and @xmath32 by @xmath41 does not change the right - hand side of the formula .",
    "therefore , the choice of @xmath32 is a matter of theoretical prejudice that can not be fixed by active - neutrino experiments alone .    in this review ,",
    "our choice of @xmath32 is roughly of the order of the other mass term in the lagrangian of the sm , the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "this choice does not lead to any intermediate scale between the electroweak and planck scales , but it does require small yukawa couplings @xmath31 .",
    "it allows us to solve , in a unified manner , the observational problems of the sm discussed above .",
    "specifically , the parameters of the model  ( [ lagr1 ] ) can be chosen such that it provides a mechanism to generate baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) and a dark matter candidate in the form of the lightest sterile neutrino .",
    "also , this theory can accommodate inflation , if one considers non - minimal coupling between the higgs boson and gravity  @xcite .",
    "finally , a scale - invariant extension of the model  @xcite that includes unimodular gravity may solve the problem of stability of the higgs mass against radiative corrections , even if the planck scale is included , and could lead to an explanation of dark energy and of the absence of the cosmological constant .    the lagrangian  ( [ lagr1 ] ) with such a choice of parameters , explaining all confirmed bsm phenomena ,  gev  @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "we do not consider them in this review , as for these phenomena standard physics explanations may exist .",
    "note , however , that the sterile neutrinos may play an important role in some of these cases ( see section  [ sec : beyond ] ) . in addition , several anomalies in particle physics experiments ( such as evidence for the neutrinoless double - beta decay  @xcite and the annual modulation of signal , observed by dama / libra  @xcite ) have been reported . however",
    ", none of them has yet been confirmed by other experiments .",
    "] has been termed the @xmath0msm the _ neutrino minimal standard model _  @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss in detail how the parameters of the lagrangian  ( [ lagr1 ] ) should be chosen so as to explain the bsm phenomena without introducing new physics above the electroweak scale .      as discussed above , the lagrangian  ( [ lagr1 ] ) can explain any pattern of active neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "a naturalness argument  @xcite , reproduced below , indicates that the masses @xmath32 should be smaller than @xmath42 gev .",
    "indeed , the stability of the higgs mass against radiative corrections , which arise from @xmath28-exchange in the loops , requires @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the higgs mass .",
    "combining this equation with the seesaw formula ( [ see - saw ] ) leads to @xmath45 any @xmath32 mass below this value is `` natural '' .",
    "also note that setting @xmath32 to zero increases the symmetry of the lagrangian ( introducing lepton number conservation ) and thus this choice is also stable against radiative corrections . in the @xmath0msmapproach",
    ", we set @xmath32 below the electroweak scale , so that these new particles are on the same footing as known quarks and leptons .",
    "the observed existence of two mass splittings ( solar and atmospheric , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1][eq:2 ] ) ) requires at least two sterile neutrinos . to estimate what neutrino data imply for the yukawa couplings , we take the larger of the two mass splittings @xmath46 and find from the seesaw relations  ( [ see - saw ] ) that @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a typical value of yukawa couplings @xmath31 .",
    "the condition @xmath49 implies that @xmath50 . clearly , the theory given in eq .",
    "( [ lagr1 ] ) can describe neutrino oscillation data even if one of the three sterile neutrinos has arbitrarily small yukawa couplings .",
    "another possible choice of parameters of the lagrangian  ( [ lagr1 ] ) , suffering from the hierarchy problem described in reference  @xcite , relates the smallness of the neutrino masses to the largeness of the majorana mass terms @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , if we take the yukawa couplings @xmath51 and the majorana masses in the range @xmath52 , we obtain the neutrino masses , as required by experimental observations .",
    "an attractive feature of this scenario is that this new scale may be associated with the grand unification theory ( gut ) scale",
    ". a model  ( [ lagr1 ] ) with this choice of parameters can also give rise to bau through leptogenesis @xcite and anomalous electroweak number non - conservation at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , we do not discuss this possibility here ; for review of the gut - scale seesaw and the thermal leptogenesis scenario associated with it , see , for instance , reference  @xcite .",
    "ev  @xcite , which we do not discuss here . ]",
    "it has been noticed that a sterile neutrino may make an interesting dark matter candidate  @xcite . in the @xmath0msm , a dark matter",
    "sterile neutrino is simply one of the singlet fermions ( for definiteness , we consider it to be @xmath53 ) .",
    "the interaction strength between the sterile neutrino and the matter is _ superweak _ with the characteristic strength @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the fermi constant and where the _ mixing angle _",
    "@xmath56 is defined as @xmath57 based on the universal tremaine ",
    "gunn bound  @xcite , the masses of sterile neutrinos are restricted to the kev range and above .",
    "specifically , for fermionic dm particles an _ average _ phase - space density in any dark matter - dominated system can not exceed the density given by the pauli exclusion principle . applied to the smallest dark matter - dominated objects [ dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the milky way , ( dsphs ) ] this bound translates into @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "a sterile neutrino is an example of _ decaying _ dm . through its mixing with the ordinary neutrinos ,",
    "@xmath53 can decay ( via @xmath59 boson exchange ) into three ( anti)neutrinos . to be dm , the lifetime of @xmath53 should be greater than the age of the universe , which restricts the mixing angle .",
    "a significantly stronger constraint comes from a subdominant one - loop decay channel into a photon and an active neutrino .",
    "the energy of the produced photon is @xmath60 , and the decay width is given by  @xcite @xmath61 ^ 5\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "the expression for the width of the dominant decay channel has the same parametric form , with the numeric coefficient being @xmath63 times larger .",
    "this radiative decay would produce a narrow line , for instance , in the diffuse x/@xmath64-ray background  @xcite .",
    "this gives a restriction on the mixing angle , @xmath65 meaning that the lifetime of sterile neutrino dm @xmath66 exceeds @xmath67  sec  @xcite  six orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe .",
    "we discuss x - ray constraints in detail in section  [ sec : restr - astro ] .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath53 sterile neutrino to the masses of the active neutrinos is of the order @xmath68 .",
    "the lifetime constraints mean that for @xmath69 the correction @xmath70 is less than the error bar in the solar neutrino mass difference  ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the neutrino @xmath53 can not contribute significantly to the active neutrino mass matrix .",
    "as we show below this conclusion is valid for all admissible masses and mixing angles .",
    "_ thus , at least three sterile neutrinos are required to account for dm and explain neutrino oscillations_. in spite of the very weak coupling of dm sterile neutrino @xmath53 with matter , it could have been produced in sufficient amounts in the early universe ( see section  [ sec : dm - production - numsm ] below ) .",

    "the concentration of dm particles , compared to that of active neutrinos , decreases by a factor of @xmath79 , and therefore the mixing angle , required to produce the same amount of dm particles _ today _ , becomes @xmath79 times bigger for the same dm mass ( compared to the @xmath82 case )  @xcite .",

    "we list below the @xmath0msmpredictions for experiments that are under way or that will be carried out in the near future .",
    "nothing but the higgs boson within the mass interval @xmath277 will be found at the lhc  @xcite ( uncertainties in these numbers are given in  @xcite ) .",
    "one of the active neutrinos in the @xmath0msmmust be very light , @xmath278  ev @xcite , which fixes the masses of the two other active neutrinos at @xmath279 ev and @xmath280 ev for normal hierarchy or @xmath281 ev for the inverted hierarchy . as a result , an effective majorana mass for neutrinoless double - beta decay",
    "can be determined @xcite . for normal ( inverted )",
    "hierarchy the constraints are @xmath282 ( @xmath283 )",
    ".    there will be negative results for the direct and indirect searches for weakly interacting massive particles , proton decay , neutron oscillations , and extra sources of cp - violation in the hadronic sector .",
    "although the experiments listed above can rule out the @xmath0msm , they can not provide its direct confirmation .",
    "we can only obtain confirmation if all three singlet fermions are discovered .",
    "astrophysical searches for the dm sterile neutrino are described at length above .",
    "laboratory searches for this particle would require a challenging , detailed analysis of the kinematics of @xmath284-decays of different isotopes @xcite . a pair of new neutral leptons , creating the baryon asymmetry of the universe , can be searched for @xcite in dedicated experiments that use existing intensive proton beams at cern , fnal , and planned neutrino facilities in japan ( j - parc ) .",
    "alternatively , one can look for a specific missing energy signal in @xmath285 , and @xmath286 decays .",
    "in general , the @xmath0msmparadigm tells us that to uncover new phenomena in particle physics we should utilize high - intensity proton beams with fixed - target experiments or to very high intensity charm or b - factories , rather than high energy accelerators .",
    "sterile neutrinos may play a key role in resolving the bsm problems . for the specific choice of parameters described above",
    ", they can explain the neutrino flavor oscillations and the origin of the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe , and can provide a dm candidate .",
    "sterile neutrino dm can be cold or warm , affecting the formation of structures at sub - mpc scales .",
    "this parameter choice does not contradict existing experimental bounds and it assumes masses below the electroweak scale .",
    "this means that sterile neutrinos can be searched for in existing accelerator and laboratory experiments .",
    "the parameter space of the sterile neutrinos in the @xmath0msmis bounded from all sides , allowing for verification or falsification of this model .",
    "the @xmath0msmis a minimal theory that can address the sm problems in a unified way .",
    "of course , the fact that it is minimal does not mean that it is correct .",
    "even if the low - energy electroweak theory indeed contains three relatively light neutral right - handed leptonic states , the full theory may be much more complicated . extending the @xmath0msmat",
    "low or high energies will change the predictions of this model .",
    "for example , introducing the low - energy supersymmetry would add another dm candidate to the theory , allowing wider variation of the parameters of dm sterile neutrinos .",
    "if gut theories are proven to be true , they would introduce another source of baryon number non - conservation , leading to a different origin of bau .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss two modest modifications of the @xmath0msm . in the first",
    ", one adds to the lagrangian  ( [ lagr1 ] ) the higher - dimensional operators given in eq .",
    "( [ lagr ] ) .",
    "this allows for production of dm sterile neutrinos at reheating after inflation @xcite , provided that they are heavier than @xmath287 kev .",
    "this does not contradict to x - ray constraints because the mixing angle @xmath193 is not essential for this production mechanism .",
    "the sterile neutrino , in this case , can only play the role of cdm candidate .    the second modification of the @xmath0msmrequires the addition of a singlet scalar field @xcite .",
    "this field may give a mass to singlet fermions due to yukawa couplings to these fermions , and it may play the role of the inflaton  @xcite .",
    "the decays of this scalar to dm sterile neutrinos may serve as an efficient mechanism of cold or warm dm production , without conflicting with x - ray constraints  @xcite .",
    "in such models the mass of sterile neutrino dm can be in the mev range or even in the gev range .",
    "the radiative decays of such dm particles can be searched for with _ fermi _  ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , whose large fov requires a new search strategy .      a final word about astrophysical applications of right - handed neutrinos , discussed in this work .",
    "the mean free path of a sterile neutrino inside a collapsing star is much larger than that of an ordinary neutrino .",
    "the escape of sterile neutrinos from the supernova may thus provide an effective cooling mechanism .",
    "for sterile neutrinos with the masses @xmath288  kev the analysis of the data from the supernova 1987a leads to an upper bound on the mixing with electron neutrino @xmath289  @xcite . in the case of sterile neutrinos with the mass @xmath290  kev the analysis shows that the mixing with the electron neutrinos is bounded by @xmath291 for @xmath292  @xcite , while the mixing with @xmath293 is bounded by @xmath294  @xcite ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) where @xmath295 and a typical supernovae core temperatures , @xmath296 , lie in the range @xmath297  @xcite . owing to large uncertainties in the supernova physics",
    ", the constraints on the mixing angle of the sterile neutrino that arise from these considerations happen to be weaker than the x - ray bounds discussed above ( section  [ sec : x - ray - constraints ] )  @xcite .",
    "at the same time , the analysis of  @xcite shows that sterile neutrinos with the masses @xmath298 and with the mixing angle with @xmath299 @xmath300 may enhance lepton number , energy , and entropy transport in supernovae explosions .",
    "the results of  @xcite indicate that sterile neutrinos with the mass @xmath301 and mixing angles @xmath302 or @xmath303 can augment shock energies of core collapse supernovae .",
    "the asymmetric emission of kev sterile neutrinos from a supernova explosion may lead to an explanation of pulsar kick velocities @xcite , see  @xcite for a review .",
    "the x - ray photons from early decays of these particles can influence the formation of molecular hydrogen and can be important for the early star formation and re - ionization @xcite .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the formation of super - massive black holes and degenerate heavy neutrino stars .    finally , if dm consists of many components ( as may occur in extensions of the @xmath0msm ) such that sterile neutrinos constitute only a fraction @xmath304 of it , the x - ray bounds shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sf - window ] become weaker by the same factor .",
    "moreover , the lyman-@xmath62 constraints also become diluted @xcite , if the rest of dm is cold .",
