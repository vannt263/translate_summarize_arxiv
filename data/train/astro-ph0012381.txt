    "hierarchical theories of galaxy formation predict that elliptical galaxies should be surrounded by dark matter halos .",
    "the study of these halos has been difficult , however , because of the lack of suitable and easily interpreted tracers such as the hi rotation curves in spiral galaxies .",
    "recent work in several fields , however , leaves no doubt about the existence of dark matter in ellipticals : x - ray data on their hot gas athmospheres implies that dark halos in ellipticals are ubiquitous and that the mass - to - light ratios are @xmath16 on scales of @xmath17 ( mushotzky @xcite , matsushita @xcite , loewenstein & white @xcite ) .",
    "gravitational lensing studies ( kochanek @xcite , keeton , kochanek & falco @xcite , griffiths @xcite ) show evidence for large @xmath6 in lens elliptical galaxies , and stellar - dynamical studies based on absorption line profile shapes have given strong constraints on the mass distributions to @xmath18 ( rix @xcite , gerhard @xcite , saglia @xcite ) , with a small to moderate dark matter fraction inside @xmath9 .    despite of this progress",
    ", the detailed mass distributions in elliptical galaxies and their variations with luminosity remain largely unknown .",
    "has the luminous matter segregated dissipatively in the halo potential ?",
    "is there a `` conspiracy '' between luminous and dark matter to produce a flat rotation curve , like in spiral galaxies ?",
    "how do the mass  to  light ratio , the slope of the circular velocity curve , or the orbital anisotropy scale with luminosity ? is the tilt of the fundamental plane simply related to a variation of the dynamical @xmath6 with @xmath7 ?",
    "do elliptical galaxies follow a tully - fisher relation ?",
    "how do the scale radii and densities of elliptical galaxy halos compare to those of spiral galaxies ?",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address some of these questions on the basis of a new dynamical study by kronawitter ( @xcite , hereafter k+2000 ) , who analyzed the dynamical structure and mass distribution for a sample of 21 bright elliptical galaxies .",
    "continuing from previous work by our group ( gerhard @xcite , saglia @xcite ) , these authors modelled the line profile shapes of in total 17 e0/e1 and 4 e2 galaxies for which kinematic data including line profile information were available from their own observations or from the literature .",
    "the dynamical structure of these galaxies turned out to be remarkably uniform .",
    "most galaxies require moderate radial anisotropy in their main bodies ( at @xmath19 ) .",
    "their circular velocity curves are all consistent with being flat outside @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath6 ratio profiles begin to rise at around @xmath21 and are consistent with x - ray and other data where available , although from the kinematic data alone constant @xmath6 models can only be ruled out at @xmath22 confidence in a few galaxies .",
    "this sample provides a new and much improved basis for investigating the dynamical family properties of elliptical galaxies , which is the subject of the present study . in section 2",
    ", we analyze the unexpectedly uniform dynamical structure of these elliptical galaxies . in section 3 , we investigate the dependence on luminosity , discussing the faber - jackson , tully - fisher and fundamental plane relations . in section 4 , we relate the dynamical mass - to - light ratios to the stellar population properties . in section 5",
    "we discuss the structure of the dark halos of these ellipticals .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "the elliptical galaxies analyzed by kronawitter ( @xcite , k+2000 ) divide in two subsamples , one with new extended kinematic data , reaching typically to @xmath18 ( ` ek sample ' , the data are from kronawitter and from several other sources referenced there ) , and one with older and less extended kinematic measurements ( ` bsg sample ' ; this is a subsample from bender , saglia & gerhard @xcite ) .",
    "based on these data and mostly published photometry , k+2000 constructed non - parametric spherical models from which circular velocity curves , radial profiles of mass - to - light ratio , and anisotropy profiles for these galaxies were derived , including confidence ranges .",
    "the galaxies were selected to rotate slowly if at all and to be as round as possible on the sky .",
    "they are luminous elliptical galaxies ( @xmath23 ) unless explicitly noted otherwise . ] .",
    "the expected mean intrinsic short - to - long axis ratio for such a sample of luminous ellipticals is @xmath24 .",
    "the mean systematic effects arising from the use of spherical models and the possible presence of small embedded face - on disks are small for the sample as a whole , but may be non - negligible in individual cases ( see k+2000 ,  5.1 ) .",
    "circular velocity curves ( cvcs ) for all galaxies in the sample are shown in figure [ vcall ] , in three bins roughly ordered by luminosity .",
    "cvcs normalized by the respective maximum circular velocity are shown in figure [ vcnorm ] separately for the two subsamples .",
    "the plotted curves correspond to the `` best '' models of k+2000 , which are taken from the central region of their 95% confidence interval for each galaxy , respectively . based on dynamical models near the boundaries of the confidence interval ,",
    "the typical uncertainty in the outermost circular velocity is @xmath25(10 - 15)% .",
    "the expected mean systematic error from flattening along the line - of - sight is smaller ; cf .   5.1 of k+2000 .",
    "the most striking result from these diagrams is that at the @xmath26 level all cvcs are flat outside @xmath27 .",
    "this result is most significant for the galaxies with the extended data , while for many galaxies from the bsg sample the radial extent of the data is insufficient to show clear trends .",
    "however , in cases where x - ray data are available ( ngc 4472 , 4486 , 4636 ) the mass profiles of the `` best '' models approximately match those from the x - ray analysis even for those galaxies ( see k+2000 ) .",
    "this result is illustrated further by figure [ vcerr ] , which shows the derived ratio @xmath28 for all galaxies of the ek - sample . here",
    "@xmath29 is the circular velocity at the radius of the last kinematic data point , and @xmath30 is the maximum circular velocity in the respective `` best '' model . for ngc 315 @xmath31 was used instead of @xmath30 .",
    "the error - bars plotted correspond to the @xmath22 confidence range for @xmath29 , compared to which the uncertainty in @xmath30 can be neglected .",
    "most of these galaxies have @xmath32 with a median at 0.94 , and 95% confidence ranges @xmath33 .",
    "the galaxies in the ek sample appear to show a `` bimodal '' distribution of cvc shapes in figs .",
    "[ vcall ] , [ vcnorm ] : for one group of galaxies the `` best '' model cvc has a peak near @xmath34 and then falls slightly until it becomes flat at @xmath35 ( ngc 1399 , ngc 3379 , ngc 5846 and ngc 6703 , the latter has the largest drop ) . in the other group",
    "the cvc rises rapidly until @xmath20 and reaches a peak at @xmath35 after which it remains nearly flat ( ngc 2434 , ngc 7145 , ngc 7192 , ngc 7507 ) .",
    "ngc 4374 and ngc 7626 may be cases from the first group where the flat part is not yet seen in the data .",

    "[ vcall ] may not be real ; a flat cvc appears also consistent with the kinematic data ( see discussion in k+2000 ) .",
    "the difference between these cvc shapes is about a @xmath37 result when comparing the model confidence bands for ek galaxies of either type , but this estimate does not include possible systematic effects from the use of spherical models .",
    "if the differences in cvc shapes are real , they could reflect small variations in the degree of dissipation and mass segregation of the baryonic component during the formation process . in any case no clear trend with galaxy luminosity is seen .",
    "figure [ bet ] shows the radial profiles of the anisotropy parameter @xmath38 for all galaxies . here",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 are the intrinsic radial and one - dimensional tangential velocity dispersions , and @xmath41 for completely radial , isotropic , and circular orbit distributions , respectively . because it is a deprojected quantity , the anisotropy derived from our models is considerably more uncertain than the total mass @xmath42",
    "; see gerhard ( @xcite ) for further discussion .",
    "the uncertainties are particularly large near the outer boundary of the data , where the range of @xmath43 values in models corresponding to the allowed potentials is usually 0.20.5 . for the inner profiles ,",
    "the allowed range is typically 0.1 - 0.2 , sometimes 0.3 .",
    "nonetheless , figure [ bet ] shows a clear trend in that almost all galaxies are radially anisotropic in the inner ( best - constrained ) regions , with the peak of the anisotropy often near 0.2 @xmath11 with values of @xmath44 .",
    "there are two cases in the ek sample which are exceptional in that they are consistent with isotropy over the whole radial range .",
    "these two are ngc 315 ( thick solid line ) , a cd galaxy , and ngc 7626 ( thick long dashed line ) , which is classified as e pec . despite their less extended and lower s / n data , the galaxies from the bsg sample show a similar trend , again with two exceptions : ngc 4636 , which we do not consider a very reliable case , and ngc 4486b , which is exceptional in almost all respects .    to get a more robust estimate of the anisotropy we have averaged the anisotropy profile between 0.1 @xmath11 and min@xmath45 , where @xmath36 is the radius of the outermost kinematic data point .",
    "these averaged anisotropies are plotted in figure [ betmvc ] versus the maximum circular velocity from fig .",
    "[ vcall ] . in a few cases",
    "this is the circular velocity at the outer boundary of the modelled range .",
    "most galaxies with extended data show a clear maximum of the cvc whereas the bsg galaxies have cvcs which may still rise outwards .",
    "for these the true maximum probably lies outside the range of the kinematic data .",
    "the error - bars plotted for @xmath43 show the standard deviation from the mean over the radial range used in the averaging .",
    "the errors plotted for @xmath46 are equal to @xmath25 one half the separation of the extreme models in the confidence interval , near the radius where the best model has its maximum .",
    "the figure shows again that all galaxies but two ( ngc 4486b and ngc 4636 ) have a mean radial anisotropy in the range from @xmath47 to @xmath48 , and also that there is no dependence on circular velocity ( or luminosity ) .",
    "radial anisotropy has also been inferred from three - integral axisymmetric models for several flattened elliptical galaxies : ngc 1600 ( e3.5 , matthias & gerhard @xcite ) , ngc 2300 ( e2 , kaeppeli @xcite ) , ngc 2320 ( e3.5 , cretton , rix & de zeeuw @xcite , ngc 3379 ( e1 , gebhardt @xcite ) .",
    "this makes it unlikely that our results are severely biased by the use of spherical dynamical models .",
    "as discussed in k+2000 , the mean intrinsic short - to - long axis ratio for our sample of elliptical galaxies is @xmath24 . because these are luminous galaxies , rotation will not contribute substantially to any flattening , so except for the flattest galaxies the bias introduced by face - on circular orbits will be small .",
    "on the other hand , possibly embedded face - on disks are likely to be less than @xmath49 in size on statistical grounds ( mehlert @xcite ) . in three galaxies of our sample ,",
    "such disks are known and extend to 6 , 7 , and 8 arcsec in ngc 4472 , ngc 4494 , ngc 7626 , respectively .",
    "in these very inner regions , these disks might cause the anisotropy to be overestimated by @xmath50 , but they will not affect the globally averaged results significantly .      we have found that both the circular velocity curves and the anisotropy profiles of elliptical galaxies are surprisingly similar . in zeroth order the cvcs can thus be characterized by two scaling constants , the effective radius and a velocity scale . in fig .",
    "[ betmvc ] we have used the maximum circular velocity ; but in fact it should not matter which velocity is used to set the scale . in particular , we would expect that a suitably defined central velocity dispersion could equally be used .",
    "a little care is needed , however , since the measured central velocity dispersion may be influenced by the gravitational field of a central black hole and by the resolution of the kinematic data .",
    "we therefore use an average central velocity dispersion @xmath53 , defined as the square root of the average of all measured @xmath54 inside @xmath55 or 3  , whichever is the larger of the two radii .",
    "this would be the inner luminosity - averaged rms velocity dispersion if the surface brightness profile were exactly proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "figure [ vcsig ] shows a plot of @xmath53 versus the maximum circular velocity for all elliptical galaxies in our sample but ngc 4486b .",
    "the error - bars for @xmath51 are taken from the allowed model range as before .",
    "for the error - bars in the @xmath53 we have taken the larger of @xmath57^{1\\over 2 }          \\over     2 \\sqrt{n-1 } \\sigma^2_{0.1 } } \\ ] ] and a weighted observational error in @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "for some galaxies the actual error of @xmath53 may be smaller than this conservative estimate from the standard deviation of the @xmath60 , but we have used this because several galaxies have velocity dispersion gradients in the central @xmath55 .",
    "[ vcsig ] shows a very good correlation ; the slope is @xmath61 for a reduced @xmath62 , as determined by the routine _ fitexy _ of press ( @xcite ) .",
    "this routine fits a straight line to the datapoints by minimizing a @xmath63 function which involves the errors in both the x- and y - variables .",
    "thus the fitted relation is completely consistent with linear ; explicitly , @xmath64    the lower panel of figure [ vcsig ] shows that the residuals from this relation are correlated with the mean orbital anisotropy defined in  [ secanisotropy ] ( the correlation would be somewhat stronger had we plotted it in terms of the maximum anisotropy ) .",
    "differences in dynamical structure thus cause some scatter in the relation between @xmath53 and @xmath51 but their influence on this and other global correlations is small . in this sense",
    "the dynamical structure of these ellipticals is indeed very uniform .",
    "the well - known relation between the total magnitude and central velocity dispersion for elliptical galaxies ( faber and jackson @xcite ) is shown in the top panel of figure [ tffj ] for the k+2000 sample of ellipticals , with @xmath53 in place of the central dispersion . in this plot and",
    "all subsequent similar plots b@xmath65 is the twice the total integrated b - band absolute magnitude within @xmath11 ( column 7 of table 4 in k+2000 ) . the errors in these b@xmath65 magnitudes are set to 0.3 mag .",
    "this accounts for observational errors and uncertainties in the distances .",
    "the latter are estimated as approximately 0.25 mag from the intrinsic scatter of the dn-@xmath66 relation , the depth of clusters ( in case of group / cluster distances ) , and a comparison of various distance determinations by tonry ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fitted slope of the faber - jackson relation for our ellipticals ( again using the errors in both variables ) is @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "the fit excludes ngc 4486b ; this galaxy is a close companion of m87 and its low luminosity for its high circular velocity suggests that the galaxy may be tidally disturbed .",
    "the uncertainty in the slope is determined with rescaled errors such that the reduced @xmath69 .",
    "the shallow slope is consistent within our errors with the slope determined from the data of faber ( 1989 ) , which give @xmath70 using their r - distances . for comparison ,",
    "the k - band slope is significantly steeper ( pahre @xcite ) .",
    "the relation between the circular velocity and total luminosity , known as tully - fisher ( @xcite , tf ) relation , is observationally well  established for spiral galaxies . from the k+2000 dynamical analysis , we now know circular velocities also for elliptical galaxies , and can thus investigate whether ellipticals also follow a tf relation .",
    "we use the @xmath51 variable and errors from  [ secstructure ] and integrated total b@xmath65 as before , for the 21 galaxies analyzed in k+2000 .",

    "their velocities @xmath87 were used directly as @xmath51 .",
    "the average of the spiral galaxy slopes is somewhat steeper than the elliptical galaxy relation , but given the large scatter in the latter and between the spiral galaxy slopes , this difference is marginal .",
    "federspiel ( @xcite ) applied their calibration to a complete sample of virgo cluster spiral galaxies to derive a mean cluster distance modulus of ( m - m)@xmath88 mag . according to faber ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the virgo cluster center is at a distance of @xmath89 . by using relative distances from faber ( @xcite ) ( the r values of their tables 3 , 4 ) and a hubble constant of @xmath86 to obtain the absolute magnitudes b@xmath65 for our elliptical galaxies",
    ", we have thus implicitly assumed a virgo cluster distance modulus of m - m@xmath90 mag , which is identical to the spiral galaxy mean virgo distance modulus of federspiel ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus the zero points of the cepheid - calibrated tf relations are directly comparable to our elliptical galaxy tf . in fact",
    ", this comparison need not make any assumption about absolute distances ; the only assumption made is that the centroid of the virgo cluster spiral galaxy sample coincides with the virgo cluster ellipticals as given by faber ( @xcite ) ; the relative distances between the ellipticals in our sample are then also fixed . therefore , the offset between elliptical and spiral galaxies in fig .",

    "the offset is indeed @xmath92 mag smaller in r than in b at @xmath93 , but note the different slopes .    in figure [ tfresds ]",
    "we show the residuals from the elliptical galaxy tf relation versus the mean velocity anisotropy @xmath94 and the effective radius .",
    "there is no obvious correlation with @xmath95 .",
    "on the other hand , the plot against @xmath11 does show a correlation , which reflects the existence of the fundamental plane ( see next section ) .    in summary , elliptical galaxies follow a tully - fisher relation , with a b - band slope that is marginally shallower than the slope for spiral galaxies , and zero point such that an @xmath78elliptical has a circular velocity @xmath96 . at given circular velocity ,",
    "elliptical galaxies are about 1 mag fainter in b than spiral galaxies .",
    "since the stellar mass - to - light ratios of elliptical galaxies vary significantly with luminosity ( see  [ seclml ] ) , it may be more revealing to plot luminous mass against circular velocity than luminosity .",

    "thus our result may indicate that giant elliptical galaxies are old , consistent with evidence from the fundamental plane ( van dokkum & franx @xcite , van dokkum @xcite , bender @xcite ) and line - strength indices ( bender , ziegler & bruzual @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , while this argument is plausible , it is not conclusive until the relation between the shallow central halo profiles inferred from observations and the cuspy halos predicted from hierarchical collapse of dark matter ( navarro , frenk & white @xcite ) is understood .",
    "moreover , it would appear to be at odds with the observation of substantial merging in a moderate z=0.83 cluster ( van dokkum @xcite ) , unless the progenitors had unusually high halo densities also , and also with the expectation that some elliptical galaxies should have formed recently from mergers of normal spiral galaxies ( e.g. , schweizer @xcite ) .",
    "the plot of halo core radius against luminosity displays considerably larger scatter for both subsamples than the plot of @xmath11 versus @xmath7 and consequently also the inferred halo density shows considerable scatter at a given luminosity .",
    "what is the origin of this increased scatter ?",
    "first , it is possible that modelling uncertainties contribute to the larger scatter in the derived @xmath173 .",
    "however , we do not think that this can be the whole explanation .",
    "the three galaxies at the upper boundary of the points in the @xmath173-@xmath7-plot which have the best kinematic data for their kind , ngc 1399 , ngc 3379 and ngc 6703 , all have @xmath212 and show evidence for small if any amount of dark matter within the modelled range .",
    "on the other hand , the best - determined galaxies near the lower boundary with the best evidence for additional dark matter , ngc 2434 , 7507 , 7626 , have @xmath213 .",
    "[ vccurves1 ] shows that the two groups have significantly different cvc shapes _ for the visible component only _ :",
    "for the first group the visible cvc is almost coincident with the dynamically inferred total cvc to @xmath101 , whereas for the second group there are significant mass discrepancies already at @xmath101 .",
    "thus elliptical galaxies at fixed @xmath191 appear to have a range of luminous matter cvcs and hence dark matter cvcs , even though the total cv rotation curves are fairly similar .",
    "also , while the most rapidly rotating galaxies in the sample , for which we would expect the largest systematic errors in the modelling , have predominantly positive residuals with respect to the least - square line , the non - rotating galaxies populate the entire distribution of residuals including the extremes .",
    "thus we believe that most of the scatter in the inferred @xmath214 is not due to modelling effects , but reflects physical differences between the sample galaxies .",
    "could the amount of dark mass in the centers of preferentially those galaxies with apparently large @xmath215 have been underestimated with our minimum halo models ?",
    "then we would expect that the derived central @xmath5 values of these galaxies should be systematically high for their luminosity , i.e. , we would expect a correlation of positive residuals from the @xmath216 relation in fig .",
    "[ lmllum ] with positive residuals in @xmath217 .",
    "however , the @xmath5 residuals for galaxies with large and small halo core radii for their luminosities do not show a systematic difference in the present sample .",
    "thus , we believe the most likely explanation for the larger scatter in @xmath215 is that galaxies of similar luminosity have different dark matter core radii and central densitites determined by the particulars of the merging process in which they were made . in this case",
    "the scatter in inferred halo density ( an order of magnitude or more ) should perhaps reflect mainly the halo densities of the progenitors at the time of formation , with the highest ( lowest ) densities corresponding to the earliest ( latest ) mergers .",
    "we have attempted to test this by plotting the minimum halo densities from fig .",
    "[ rclum ] versus the population ages of section  [ secpop ] , but no convincing correlation is seen in the present data .",
    "figure [ accdensml ] finally shows mass - to - light ratios @xmath5 normalized by the central value , as a function of acceleration @xmath218 and mean interior density @xmath219 , for all galaxies in the ek subsample with extended data .",
    "the estimated uncertainty in @xmath220 from that in @xmath46 and distance is of order @xmath221 .",
    "figure [ accdensml ] shows that the `` bending upwards '' which indicates the onset of dark matter takes place at systematically higher accelerations @xmath220 than in spiral galaxies ( mcgaugh @xcite ) , by about one order of magnitude , which is a consequence of the higher halo mass densities in elliptical galaxies .",
    "this suggests that the acceleration scale found in spiral galaxies is not universal as required by the modified gravity theory mond ( milgrom @xcite ) , i.e. , that in elliptical galaxies an additional gradient in @xmath6 would be required besides mond .",
    "based on a uniform dynamical analysis of photometric and line - profile shape data for 21 mostly luminous , slowly rotating , and nearly round ( 17 e0/e1 , 4 e2 ) elliptical galaxies by kronawitter ( @xcite ) , we have investigated the dynamical family relations and dark halo properties of ellipticals .",
    "our main results are as follows :    \\(1 ) the circular velocity curves ( cvcs ) of elliptical galaxies are flat to within @xmath0 for @xmath1 to at least @xmath222 , independent of luminosity .",
    "this argues against strong luminosity segregation in the dark halo potential .",
    "\\(4 ) elliptical galaxies follow a tully - fisher ( tf ) relation with marginally shallower slope than spiral galaxies . at given circular velocity , they are about 1 mag fainter in b and about 0.6 mag in r , and appear to have slightly lower baryonic mass than spirals , even for the maximum @xmath5 allowed by the kinematics .",
    "\\(6 ) the luminosity dependence of @xmath6 indicated by the tilt of the fp corresponds to a real dependence of dynamical @xmath6 on @xmath7 .",
    "the tilt of the fp is therefore not due to deviations from homology or a variation of dynamical anisotropy with @xmath7 , although the slope of @xmath6 versus @xmath7 could still be influenced by photometric non - homology .",
    "the tilt can also not be due to an increasing dark matter fraction with @xmath7 , unless ( i ) the most luminous ellipticals have a factor @xmath224 less baryonic mass than spiral galaxies of the same circular velocity , ( ii ) the range of imf is larger than currently discussed , and ( iii ) the imf or some other population parameter varies systematically along the luminosity sequence such as to undo the increase of @xmath6 expected from simple stellar population models for more metal - rich luminous galaxies .",
    "this seems highly unlikely .",
    "\\(7 ) the tilt of the fp is therefore best explained as a stellar population effect .",
    "population models show that the values and the change with @xmath191 of the maximal dynamical @xmath5s are consistent with the stellar population @xmath5s based on published metallicities and ages within the uncertainties of imf and distance scale .",
    "the main driver is therefore probably metallicity , and a secondary population effect is needed to explain the k - band tilt .",
    "\\(8 ) the population models show that we would have underestimated the luminous masses by as much as a factor @xmath146 only if ( i ) the flattest imfs at low stellar masses discussed for the milky way are applicable to our elliptical galaxies , and simultaneously ( ii ) a short distance scale ( @xmath145 ) turns out to be correct . for lower values of @xmath147 and/or the other imfs investigated in section [ secpop ]",
    "the difference is smaller .",
    "together with ( 4 ) this makes it likely that elliptical galaxies have indeed nearly maximal @xmath5 ratios ( minimal halos ) .",
    "\\(9 ) despite the uniformly flat cvcs , there is a spread in the ratio of the cvcs from luminous and dark matter , i.e. , in the radial variations of cumulative mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the sample includes galaxies with no indication for dark matter within @xmath9 , and others where the best dynamical models result in local @xmath5s of 20 - 30 at @xmath9 . as in spiral galaxies ,",
    "the combined rotation curve of the luminous and dark matter is flatter than those for the individual components ( `` conspiracy '' ) .",
    "\\(10 ) in models with maximum stellar mass , the dark matter contributes @xmath225 of the mass within @xmath11 .",
    "our flat rotation curve models , when extrapolated beyond the range of kinematic data , predict equal interior mass of dark and luminous matter at @xmath12 , consistent with results from the x - ray temperature - velocity relation .",
    "\\(11 ) even in these maximum stellar mass models , the halo core densities and phase - space densities are at least @xmath13 times larger and the halo core radii @xmath14 times smaller than in spiral galaxies of the same circular velocity .",
    "correspondingly , the increase in @xmath6 sets in at @xmath15 times larger acceleration than in spirals .",
    "this could imply that elliptical galaxy halos collapsed at redshifts @xmath226 or that some of the dark matter in ellipticals might be baryonic .",
