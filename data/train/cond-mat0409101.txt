    "pure nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) is a very useful tool for studying electronic properties of materials without the need to apply an external magnetic field .",
    "one famous example is in the study of superconductors where magnetic fields penetrate the sample in a non uniform way or do not penetrate at all .",
    "the nqr is determined by two parameters : a frequency scale @xmath5 and asymmetry parameter @xmath0 each carry important information on the charge distribution in the system under investigation . however , for nuclei with @xmath6 there is only one resonance frequency out of which one can not separate @xmath5 and @xmath0 . in recent years some ingenious experimental methods have been invented to extract these parameters without applying a field .",
    "this include 1d @xcite , and amplitude @xcite and phase modulated @xcite 2d nutation spectroscopy . however , these methods are based on the assumptions that the nqr line is much narrower than the effective nutation frequency ( which is on the order of @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the radio frequency ( rf )  field and @xmath9 is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio ) .",
    "naturally , there are many occasions where these requirements are not met ; superconductors , magnetic materials , and systems with disorder are just a few examples .",
    "in this paper we provide an alternative method , based purely on nqr , of determining @xmath0 ( and therefore @xmath5 ) separately for a spin @xmath10 in systems with broad lines .",
    "in addition , in cases with tetragonal symmetry ( @xmath11 ) , our new method is sensitive to the fluctuations in @xmath0 , thus providing a measure of the system s homogeneity .",
    "however , this method is applicable only to single crystals or oriented powders where all observed nuclei have the same principal axis of the efg .",
    "the main idea of the new method is to measure the signal intensity as a function of the angle between the rf field @xmath12 and the principal axes of the efg , hence it is named angle depended nqr ( adnqr ) . in the experiment the sample is rotated with respect to the symmetry axis of the coil .    [ ptb ]    crystal.eps",
    "a full theory of the signal intensity as a function of rf field direction was given by pratt @xcite . however , his focus was mainly on the line shape moments in the case of dipolar coupling , and not on the extraction of @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore re - derive the same calculation from our viewpoint .",

    ". in general , such broadening could stamp from crystal defects , impurities , or grain boundaries . in the cuprate superconductors ( which will be examined here )",
    "the broadening might be due to charge segregation @xcite . in these cases of broad lines ,",
    "a potential use of adnqr is to scan @xmath15 point by point , determine @xmath0 at each point by adnqr , and extract @xmath5 at each point from eq .",

    "an important limit which could be further analyzed is @xmath65 .",
    "since there is no difference between the two planes we denote the efficiency factor at @xmath63 by @xmath70 .",
    "this result was first obtained by das and hahn @xcite . in this case the optimum pulse length is given by @xmath71 at which the signal amplitude is @xmath72 when keeping the pulse length constant and transmitting in any other direction the relative signal intensity will be @xmath73 in particular , when transmitting along the @xmath66 direction @xmath74 , and @xmath75 this result is important for cases where @xmath0 fluctuates due to crystal inhomogeneity . to appreciate such fluctuations",
    "one can determine the averaged @xmath0 by standard methods and the fourth moment of the @xmath0 distribution by adnqr .",
    "thus measurements of @xmath76 could provide information on the quality of the crystal .",
    "next we discuss the situation of oriented powders where the @xmath66 direction is well defined but the @xmath77 directions are interchangeable .",
    "one example is high temperature superconductors .",
    "the samples are usually made from grains of single crystal oriented in a magnetic field so that their @xmath66 direction aligns with the field direction .",

    "[ powder ] ( solid lines ) do not fit the experimental results exactly .",
    "there could be three possible reasons for this .",
    "one is that the rf field inside the coil is not uniform enough , the second is that yba@xmath2cu@xmath86o@xmath4 is not perfectly oriented , and the third is that , while the average @xmath0 in yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 is zero , fluctuation are important due to charge inhomogeneity .",
