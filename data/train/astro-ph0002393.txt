    "although radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have been studied for several decades , still not much is known about their birth and subsequent evolution .",
    "the recent identification of a class of very young radio sources can be considered as a major breakthrough in this respect , since it has opened many unique opportunities for radio source evolution studies .",
    "unfortunately , the nomenclature and use of acronyms in this field of research is rather confusing .",
    "this is mainly caused by the different ways in which young radio sources are selected .",
    "selection of young sources is made in two ways , the first based on their broadband radio spectra , and the second based on their compact morphology .",
    "a convex shaped spectrum , peaking at about 1 ghz distinguishes young radio sources from other classes of compact radio sources . in this case",
    "they are called gigahertz peaked spectrum ( * gps * ) radio sources ( eg . odea etal .",
    "1991 , odea 1998 ) .",
    "similar objects , which are typically an order of magnitude larger in size , have their spectral turnovers shifted to the @xmath6 mhz regime , causing them to be dominated at cm wavelengths by the optically thin parts of their spectra .",
    "these are called compact steep spectrum ( * css * ) radio sources to distinguish them from the general population of extended steep spectrum sources ( eg .",
    "fanti et al .",
    "1991 ) .    on the other hand , young radio sources are found in multi - frequency vlbi surveys , in which they can be recognised by compact jet / lobe - like structures on both sides of their central core .",
    "they are called compact symmetric objects ( * cso * , wilkinson et al .",
    "their double sided structures clearly distinguish them from the large majority of compact sources showing one - sided core - jet morphologies .",
    "this implies that the luminosities of cso are unlikely to be substantially enhanced by doppler boosting .",
    "larger versions of csos are subsequently called medium symmetric objects ( * mso * ) and large symmetric objects ( * lso * ) .",
    "the overlap between the classes of cso and gps galaxies is large and we believe that they can be considered to be identical objects .",
    "however , note that a substantial fraction of gps sources are optically identified with high redshift quasars , which in general show core - jet structures ( stanghellini et al .",
    "the relationship between gps quasars and gps galaxies / cso is not clear and under debate ( snellen et al .",
    "we therefore believe it is wise to restrict evolution studies to gps galaxies and csos .      although it was always speculated that gps sources were young objects , only recently has strong evidence been found to support this hypothesis .",
    "monitoring several gps sources over a decade or more using vlbi , allowed owsianik & conway ( 1998 ) and owsianik , conway & polatidis ( 1998 ) to measure the hotspot advance speeds of several prototype gps sources to be @xmath7 .",
    "these imply dynamical ages of typically @xmath8 years .",
    "additional proof for youth comes from analysis of the overall radio spectra of the somewhat larger css sources .",
    "murgia et al ( 1999 ) show that their spectra can be fitted with synchrotron aging models , implying ages of typically @xmath9 years .",
    "the work of these authors shows that gps / cso sources are very young and most likely the progenitors of large , extended radio sources .",
    "this makes them key objects for radio source evolution studies .",
    "several authors have used number count statistics and linear size distributions to constrain the luminosity evolution of radio sources ( fanti et al .",
    "1995 ; readhead et al .",
    "1996 , odea & baum 1997 ) .",
    "all these studies find an excess of young objects in relation to the number of old , extended radio sources .",
    "this over - abundance of gps and css sources has generally been explained by assuming that a radio source significantly decreases in luminosity over its lifetime . in this way , sources are more likely to contribute to flux density limited samples at young than at old age , causing the apparent excess .",
    "however , in addition to their over - abundance , gps galaxies are found to be significantly more biased towards high redshift than large extended radio galaxies ( snellen & schilizzi , 2000 ) .",
    "this is puzzling since classes of sources representing similar objects at different stages of their evolution are expected to have similar birth functions and redshift distributions .",
    "furthermore , it suggests that the interpretation of their number count statistics , which are averaged over a large redshift range , is not so straightforward .",
    "we have postulated a simple evolution scenario which can resolve these puzzles .",
    "we argue that the luminosity evolution of a radio - loud agn during its first @xmath10 years is qualitatively very different from that during the rest of its lifetime .",
    "this may be caused by a turnover in the density profile of the interstellar / intergalactic medium at the core - radius of the host galaxy , resulting in an increase in luminosity for young , and a decrease in luminosity for old radio - loud agn with time .",
    "such a luminosity evolution results in a flatter collective luminosity function for the young objects , causing their bias towards higher redshifts , and their over - abundance at bright flux density levels ( snellen et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "an alternative explanation is that gps sources are indeed young agn , but mainly short - lived objects , which will never evolve into extended radio sources ( readhead et al .",
    "1994 ) . in that case",
    ", the two populations are not directly connected , and no similar cosmological evolution or redshift distribution is necessary .",
    "in general , the angular resolution of vlbi observations at a certain observing frequency is limited by the size of the earth .",
    "the combination of ground vlbi stations with the japanese satellite halca ( part of the vlbi space observatory programme vsop ) , achieves a resolution typically 3 times higher than this ( @xmath11 mas and @xmath12 mas at 1.6 and 5 ghz respectively ) . in particular , the study of gps sources benefits from vsop , since observing at a higher frequency to achieve a similar resolution is often not an option , because of their steep fall - off in flux density towards high frequency .",
    "furthermore , their physical properties are most interesting around their spectral turnover , where differences in spectral indices within the source are more prominent than at high frequency .",
    "we have been awarded vsop observing time for 11 and 8 of the brightest and most compact gps sources at 5.0 and 1.6 ghz respectively .",
    "details and status of the observations are listed in table [ table1 ] . at the time of writing ,",
    "all targets at 5 ghz , and 6 of the 8 sources at 1.6 ghz have been observed .",
    ".status of vsop observations .",
    "[ table1 ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^ \" , ]      a large fraction of the sources have now been imaged .",
    "some examples are shown in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "additional observations have been taken at 15 ghz with the vlba to match the 5 ghz vsop data in resolution , which will allow detailed spectral decompositions of the objects .",
    "in particular , this may sched new light on the nature of the gps quasars and the role of doppler boosting in these sources .",
    "one of the first results of these observations are the high brightness temperatures observed of typically @xmath0 kelvin .",
    "this indicates that these objects must be near their synchrotron self absorption ( ssa ) turnover at the observed frequency , making it very likely that indeed ssa is the cause of their spectral peaks .",
    "this is in agreement with the statistical arguments of snellen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who found that among samples of gps and css sources , the ratio of component size , as derived from the spectral peak assuming ssa , and overall angular size , are constant and very similar to those found for large extended radio sources .",
    "this not only implies self - similar evolution , but also provides strong evidence for ssa .",
    "note however , that several authors argue that free - free absorption can not be ruled out for the smallest gps galaxies ( kameno et al .",
    ", this volume ; marr et al .",
    ", this volume )    a valuable spin - off from these high angular resolution vsop observations come from their comparison with ground - based vlbi images taken at an earlier epoch . following the method of owsianik & conway ( 1998 )",
    ", we use these to derive dynamical ages for gps sources . in this way",
    ", we find that the two dominant components at 5 ghz of 2021 + 614 ( fig [ fig2 ] ) , have a larger separation at the epoch of the vsop observations , compared to data from conway et al .",
    "( 1994 ) taken in 1982 and 1987 .",
    "the increase in separation indicates a hotspot advance speed of @xmath13c , which implies an age of @xmath14 years for these components ( tschager et al .",
    "preliminary analysis of 0108 + 388 ( fig [ fig1 ] ) shows an advance speed of 15 @xmath15/yr , consistent with what is found by owsianik , conway & polatidis ( 1998 ; 9 @xmath16 ) .",
    "these observations confirm the young ages of a few hundred years for the most compact gps galaxies .",
    "gps galaxies and cso are now identified as classes of young radio sources .",
    "they form a key element in the investigation of the evolution of radio - loud agn .",
    "we report on vsop observations of 11 and 8 bright gps sources at 5.0 and 1.6 ghz frequency respectively .",
    "first analysis indicates high brightness temperatures consistent with synchrotron self absorption as the cause of their spectral turnover .",
    "comparison with ground - based vlbi datasets taken at earlier epochs confirm the very young ages for the most compact gps galaxies of a few hundred years .",
