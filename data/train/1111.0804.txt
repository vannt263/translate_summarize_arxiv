    "practically , any textbook on general relativity contains information concerning possible geodesic circular orbits of a spinless test particle in a schwarzschild background as an important point of description of the black hole properties .",
    "the known result is that by the geodesic equations these orbits are allowed only for @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the schwarzschild radial coordinate and @xmath5 is the horizon radius ) and the highly relativistic circular orbits exist only for @xmath0 , where @xmath6 [ 1,2,4 ] . on the contrary , information on possible circular orbits of a spinning test particle in schwarzschild s background can be found in the book sources very rarely .",
    "probably it is a result that the mathisson - papapetrou ( mp ) equations [ 5 , 6 ] , which describe motions of a classical ( non - quantum ) spinning particle in general relativity , were significantly less known than the geodesic equations . in this context",
    "we note that even the encyclopedic book on general relativity [ 2 ] devotes to the mp equations only one page and the seminal work of m. mathisson is not pointed out in the bibliography of [ 2 ] .",
    "( the interesting history of the mp equations is elucidated in the special issue of the journal cited in ref . [ 3 ] . )",
    "however , because the real physical processes of the gravitational collapse are connected with behavior of the particles with spin , as protons and electrons , the analysis of this phenomena and of the physics of black holes can not be restricted on the geodesic equations . even if one can motivate that the role of spin is negligible , this fact must be clearly pointed out and in this context it is necessary to recall the mp equations .    among other types of motions the circular highly relativistic orbits are of importance for investigations of possible synchrotron radiation , both electromagnetic and gravitational , of protons and electrons in the gravitational field of a black hole [ 712 ] .",
    "the circular orbits of a spinning particle according to the mp equations in the schwarzschild , kerr and other backgrounds were considered in many papers [ 1326 ] in different context . in particular , the stability of the corresponding orbits was under investigation in [ 13 , 1517 , 26 ] ; the clock effect was studied in [ 18 , 19 ] ; and the precession of spin was considered in [ 22 , 23 ] . in some papers",
    "the corresponding effects are calculated by different conditions [ 16 , 1820 ] . most often the supplementary conditions of mathisson - pirani [ 5 , 27 ] or tulczyjew - dixon [ 28 , 29 ] are used .    without any supplementary condition ,",
    "the mp equations are suitable for describing the wide range of the _ representative points _ which can be in different connection with a rotating particle . however ,",
    "if we need to describe , in the proper sense , just the _ inner rotation _ of the particle , it is necessary to fix the concrete corresponding representative point . in newtonian mechanics , the inner angular momentum of a rotating body",
    "is defined relative to its center of mass and just the motion of this center represents the propagation of the body in the space .",
    "naturally , one can expect the similar approach in relativity .",
    "however , as pointed out by c. mller [ 30 , 31 ] , in relativity the position of the center of mass of a rotating body depends on the frame and , therefore , the mathisson - pirani supplementary condition , which follows from the usual definition of the center of mass position , and is common for the so - called proper and nonproper centers of mass .",
    "( here we use the terminology when the proper frame for a spinning body is determined as a frame where the axis of the body rotation is at rest .",
    "correspondingly , the proper center of mass is calculated in the proper frame . ) according to mller s interpretation , the usual solutions of the mp equations at the mathisson - pirani condition in the minkowski spacetime describe the motion of the proper center of mass of a spinning body , whereas the helical solutions describe the motions of the family of the nonproper centers of mass .",
    "some properties of different centers of mass were discussed in [ 32 ] and the more detailed analysis is presented in [ 33 ] .",
    "it is shown that mathisson s helical motions for a spinning particle are fully physical in the context of mller s kinematical interpretation , in contrast to some assertions in the literature , and the physical validity of the mathisson - pirani condition is proved [ 33 ] .",
    "we note that the pointed out helical solutions of the mp equations are often called _",
    "weyssenhoff s _ solutions , taking into account the paper [ 34 ] .",
    "it is of importance that the mathisson - pirani condition _",
    "`` ... arises in a natural fashion in the course of the derivation '' _ , [ 35 ] . a simple and clear derivation of this condition is presented , for example , in [ 36 ] . in this context",
    "it is useful to recall a simple visual situation which follows from this derivation as a partial case .",
    "namely , following [ 32 ] , sec .",
    "5 , let us consider a sphere of uniform mass density at rest .",
    "the center of mass of this sphere coincides with its geometrical center .",
    "now let the sphere rotate about a proper axis .",
    "because of the axial symmetry , the proper center of mass of this rotation sphere remains in the geometrical center .",
    "then if this center is chosen as the representative point for this sphere to describe its motion in the gravitational field by the mp equations , just the mathisson - pirani condition must be satisfied .",
    "naturally , other supplementary conditions can be used for the description of other representative points .",
    "in contrast to the mathisson - pirani condition , the tulczyjew - dixon one picks out a unique ( nonhelical ) worldline of a spinning particle in the gravitational field .",
    "just to avoid the helical solutions the tulczyjew - dixon condition was used in many papers .",
    "especially highly relativistic circular orbits of a spinning particle in the schwarzschild and kerr fields were investigated in [ 12 , 37 ] .",
    "it was shown that in the schwarzschild field these orbits exist in the small neighborhood of the value @xmath7 , both for @xmath2 and @xmath8 , in contrast to the geodesic highly relativistic circular orbits [ 12 ] .",
    "we stress that in [ 12 , 37 ] only the mathisson - pirani condition was used .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the results of more detailed analysis of highly relativistic circular orbits in schwarzschild s field which follow from the mp equations both under the mathisson - pirani and tulczyjew - dixon conditions .",
    "besides , some noncircular highly relativistic orbits are considered as well .    in sec .",
    "2 the mp equations , mathisson - pirani and tulczyjew - dixon supplementary conditions , and other general relationships , which are valid for any metric , are presented . in sec .",

    "4 to describe the region of existence of the highly relativistic circular orbits of a spinning particle in the schwarzschild field and to determine the dependence of the particle s orbital velocity on its spin and radial coordinate .",
    "the similar problem is under investigation in sec . 5 at the mathisson - pirani supplementary condition .",
    "section 6 is devoted to some numerical examples of the noncircular highly relativistic motions of a spinning particle in the schwarzschild background according to the exact mp equations at the mathisson - pirani condition .",
