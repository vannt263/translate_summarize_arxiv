    "recently , simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) has drawn an upsurge of interests @xcite-@xcite . by swipt ,",
    "mobile users are provided with both wireless data and energy accesses at the same time , which brings great convenience .",
    "however , there is one crucial issue for realizing swipt systems in practice , i.e. , existing receiver circuits can not decode information and harvest energy from the same received signal independently . as a result ,",
    "the receiver architecture design plays a significant role in determining the trade - offs between the end - to - end information versus energy transfer .",
    "two practical receiver designs have been proposed for swipt , namely , time switching ( ts ) and power splitting ( ps ) @xcite . with ts ,",
    "the receiver switches over time between decoding information and harvesting energy , while with ps , the receiver splits the received signal into two streams of different power for decoding information and harvesting energy separately . based on the ps scheme , a novel integrated receiver architecture for swipt",
    "was proposed in @xcite , where the circuit for radio frequency ( rf ) to baseband conversion in the conventional information receiver is integrated to the front end of energy receiver via a rectifier , thus achieving a small form factor as well as energy saving .",
    "the ts and ps schemes have also been investigated for swipt over fading channels to exploit opportunistic information and energy transmissions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that theoretically , ts can be regarded as a special form of ps with only binary split power ratios , and thus in general ps achieves better rate - energy transmission trade - offs than ts @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , in practice ps is implemented differently from ts since the former requires an rf signal splitter @xcite while the latter only needs a simpler switcher .",
    "another key concern for swipt is drastically decaying power transfer efficiency with the increasing transmission distance due to propogation pass loss . to tackle this problem , mimo ( multiple - input multiple - output ) techniques by employing multiple antennas at the transmitter and/or receiver",
    "have been proposed in @xcite to significantly improve the power transfer efficiency while still achieving high spectral efficiency for information transmission .",
    "moreover , @xcite extended @xcite to the case with imperfect channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter",
    ". in @xcite , a miso ( multiple - input single - output ) multicast swipt system with no csi at the transmitter was studied , where random beamforming was proposed to improve the performance of opportunistic energy and information multicasting over quasi - static fading channels . since in practice information and energy receivers",
    "have very different power sensitivity ( e.g. , @xmath0dbm for the information receiver versus @xmath1dbm for the energy receiver ) @xcite , @xcite , a `` near - far '' or receiver - location based scheduling for a miso swipt system was proposed in @xcite , where receivers that are close to the transmitter are scheduled for energy transmission , while others that are more distant away from the transmitter are scheduled for information transmission , to resolve the receiver issue . in @xcite ,",
    "the receiver - location based scheduling is extended to a miso swipt system with the additional secrecy information transmission constraint .",
    "furthermore , multi - antenna swipt systems have also been recently studied under the interference channel ( ic ) setup .",
    "a two - user mimo ic was studied in @xcite for swipt , where the achievable information and energy transmission trade - offs by different combinations of transmission modes at the two transmitters are characterized .",
    "the swipt system was also studied in the @xmath2-user miso ic in @xcite and @xcite based on ps and ts receivers , respectively .        in this paper",
    ", we further study the multi - antenna and ps enabled swipt system by considering a miso broadcast channel consisting of one multi - antenna base station ( bs ) and a set of @xmath3 single - antenna mobile stations ( mss ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "we focus our study on ps receivers instead of ts receivers in @xcite , @xcite , such that each ms can receive both information and energy from the bs continuously at all time .",
    "each ms is assumed to have its own required signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) for information decoding as well as harvested power amount for energy harvesting . under the above two types of constraints at the same time , we study the joint design of transmit beamforming at bs and receive ps ratios at mss to minimize the total transmission power .",
    "first , we derive the sufficient and necessary condition for the feasibility of our formulated problem .",
    "interestingly , it is shown that the feasibility of this problem only depends on the sinr constraints but not on the harvested power constraints .",
    "next , we apply the technique of sdr @xcite to solve this non - convex problem , due to the coupled design variables of both beamforming vectors and ps ratios .",
    "we prove that sdr is indeed tight for our problem and thus it yields optimal beamforming solution .",
    "furthermore , we present two suboptimal designs of lower complexity , in which the transmit beamforming vectors are first designed based on the zero - forcing ( zf ) and the sinr - optimal criteria , respectively , and then the receive ps ratios are optimized to minimize the transmission power . finally , we compare the performance of our proposed optimal and suboptimal solutions by simulations .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the miso swipt system model and the formulation of our joint beamforming and ps design problem .",
    "section iii provides the feasibility condition for the formulated problem .",
    "section iv presents the optimal solution based on sdr and proves its optimality .",

    "we first derive the sufficient and necessary condition for the feasibility of the jbps problem in , and then propose both optimal and suboptimal solutions to this problem . .",

    "problem is a well - known sinr feasibility problem and its feasibility region over @xmath40 s has been characterized in the literature .",
