    "despite many experimental and theoretical studies , the spin - half kagome lattice heisenberg model remains incompletely understood and a subject of intense ongoing research.@xcite the kagome lattice is a two - dimensional lattice of corner sharing triangles , where classical antiferromagnetic models lead to exponential ground state degeneracy . whether quantum fluctuations lift this degeneracy and lead to an ordered state , or select a valence - bond order , or lead to a resonating valence - bond quantum spin - liquid possibly with topological order and fractional excitations remains a topic of great interest .",
    "numerical evidence shows that many distinct singlet states are very close to each other in energy.@xcite    the hyperkagome lattice is a three - dimensional lattice of corner sharing triangles , where similar ground state degeneracy at the classical level and possible competing phases with nearly the same energy in presence of strong quantum fluctuations remains valid .",
    "experimental discovery@xcite of the material na@xmath6ir@xmath7o@xmath8 , where the @xmath10 ions form a hyperkagome lattice , with strong signatures of a gapless quantum spin - liquid phase has led to much excitement .",
    "theoretical proposals for this system also include various quantum spin - liquids as well as valence bond order.@xcite    in this paper , we develop high temperature series expansions for @xmath0 and the uniform structure factor of the spin - half hyperkagome lattice heisenberg model to order @xmath1 .",
    "these series expansions are used to calculate the uniform susceptibility , the entropy and the heat capacity of the model .",

    "these results are reminiscent of similar results on the kagome lattice.@xcite    although the susceptibility data can be well fit by a curie - weiss law over a wide temperature range , the effective curie - weiss constant keeps changing with the region of fit.@xcite comparison with the experimental susceptibility data shows that the material is described by a @xmath15 value of approximately @xmath16.@xcite this @xmath15 value is consistent with more recent high - field measurements.@xcite there are also clear deviations below @xmath17 , where the series extrapolation are still well convergent .",
    "these presumably arise from smaller exchange terms induced by spin - orbit couplings , such as the dzyaloshinski - moria interactions , which are not included in our theoretical studies.@xcite similar anisotropy terms are also known to be present in the kagome antiferromagnets.@xcite    experimental determination of the magnetic heat capacity requires subtraction of non - magnetic contributions , which becomes increasingly uncertain with increasing temperature .",
    "our study can not shed light on the low temperature power - laws observed in the material . at temperatures above @xmath18 which translates to @xmath19 for the material , where our results are well converged",

    "the susceptibility can be fit to a curie - weiss law , whose asymptotic value for our model is @xmath33 .",

    "it can be defined around a temperature @xmath34 as @xmath35 a plot of this effective curie - weiss constant as a function of @xmath36 is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we see that even at temperatures of @xmath37 the effective curie - weiss constant is @xmath38 percent off its asymptotic value . at temperatures around and below @xmath15",
    "the effective curie - weiss constant is larger than @xmath39 .",
    "this means that the exchange constant must be a factor of 2 or more smaller than determined by okamoto et al.@xcite indeed , @xmath40 and @xmath41 leads to an excellent fit of the experimental data above @xmath42 .",

    "if we use an [ n+2/n ] pade to represent the heat capcity , it ensures a @xmath48 dependence .",
    "all such extrapolations are close to the [ 6/4 ] approximant shown .",
    "however , they can not be right .",
    "the integration of the heat capacity implies a large missing entropy of order @xmath11 percent .",
    "a similar problem was observed in extrapolating the high temperature series for the kagome lattice heisenberg model.@xcite if instead we use d - log pad approximants to extrapolate the series , we find that the majority of the approximants show a second rise in the heat capacity at a temperature below @xmath49 . however , once again the convergence breaks down as the second peak arises .",
    "the method developed by misguich and bernu@xcite may be helpful in this regard . however , their method is based on taking advantage of our knowledge of the ground state and the low temperature properties in the extrapolation of the high temperature expansions . since we know",
    "even less about the ground state properties of the hyperkagome lattice than we do about the kagome lattice , it is unclear how useful it would be at this stage .     the molar heat capacity for the hyperkagome lattice heisenberg model with @xmath40 .",

    "we clearly can not address the low temperature power - laws , which occur at temperatures well below our range of convergence .",
    "the discrepancy at higher temperatures can possibly be attributed to an incomplete subtraction .",
    "experimental determination of the magnetic specific heat requires subtraction of phonon and other contributions .",
    "when the @xmath15 values are comparable to room temperature , this becomes difficult as the phonon contributions are not simply power - laws .",
    "for this material , the non - magnetic na@xmath6sn@xmath7o@xmath8 was used to subtract the phonons .",
    "but such a subtraction need not be accurate above some temperature .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig .  5 ,",
    "the entropy obtained from the experimental data exceeds the theoretical curves above 70 k and exceeds @xmath53 before @xmath54 k. in our calculations , the entropy is well converged down to about @xmath55 k. it is also much less sensitive upto these temperatures to extrapolation methods , and to addition of other smaller exchange constants .",
    "we believe , there can be two reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "first , the subtraction is incomplete .",
    "indeed , if we further subtract harmonic oscillator modes with a density of states of about @xmath51 moles at a single frequency of @xmath52 that can bring the data into good agreement with experiments , as shown in fig .  4 .",
    "a second possibility is that the materials have additional entropy associated with itinerant degrees of freedom because they are not too far from a metal insulator transition .",
    "this issue can presumably be addressed by further experiments .",
    "in this paper , we have developed high temperature series expansions for various thermodynamic properties of the heisenberg model on the hyperkagome lattice .",
    "these expansions enable us to compute various thermodynamic properties , such as the uniform susceptibility , the heat capacity and the entropy down to a temperature of @xmath5 .",
    "comparison with the experimental data for na@xmath6ir@xmath7o@xmath8 suggests that the heisenberg model is a good starting model for the material with an exchange constant @xmath9 .",
    "however , we find that there must be additional terms also present in the material .",
    "the observed low temperature power - laws can not be addressed by our calculations . we have suggested possible resolutions to discrepancies in higher temperature heat capacity and entropy data for the material .",
