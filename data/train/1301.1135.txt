    "market impact modeling ( i.e , the influence of market orders on forthcoming prices ) is a longstanding problem in market microstructure literature and is obviously of great interest for practitioners ( see e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "even if there are various ways to define and estimate the impact associated with an order or a meta - order , a large number of empirical results have been obtained recently .",
    "the theory of market price formation and the relationship between the order flow and price changes has made significant progress during the last decade @xcite .",
    "many empirical studies have provided evidence that the price impact has , to many respects , some universal properties and is the main source of price variations .",
    "this corroborates the picture of an `` endogenous '' nature of price fluctuations that contrasts with the classical scenario according to which an `` exogenous '' flow of information leads the prices towards a `` true '' fondamental value @xcite .",
    "we will not review in details all these results but simply recall the point of view of bouchaud et al @xcite .",
    "these authors propose a model of price fluctuations by generalizing kyle s pioneering approach @xcite according to which the price is written ( up to a noise term ) as the result of the impact of all trades .",
    "if @xmath0 stands for the trading time , bouchaud et al .",
    "model is written as follows @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a white noise while @xmath3 with @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "@xmath5 ) if a trade occurs at the best ask ( resp . at best bid ) and @xmath6 describes the volume dependence of a single trade impact .",
    "the function @xmath7 accounts for the temporal dependence of a market order impact .",
    "even if models like represent a real breakthrough in the understanding of price dynamics they have many drawbacks .",
    "first , the nature and the status of the noise @xmath2 is not well defined .",
    "more importantly , these models involve discrete events ( through the trading or event time ) only defined at a microstructural level though they intend to represent some coarse version of prices ( indeed , the price @xmath8 in the previous equation can take arbitrary continuous values , moreover , calibrating its volatility at any scale involves some additional parameter , ... ) .",
    "moreover , these models can not account for real time ( i.e `` physical time '' ) dynamics or real time aggregation properties of price fluctuations . in that respect",
    ", they are not that easy to be used in real high frequency applications such as optimized execution . to make it short , though being defined at finest time scales , they can not account for the main microstructure properties of price variations related to their discrete nature : prices live on tick grids and jump at discrete random times .",
    "our aim in this paper is mainly to define _ continuous time _ version of the market impact price model discussed previously . for that purpose",
    ", point processes @xcite provide a natural framework .",
    "let us not that point processes have been involved in many studies in high frequency finance from the famous ` zero - intelligence' order - book models @xcite to models for trade @xcite or book events @xcite irregular arrivals . in a recent series of papers @xcite , we have shown that self - excited point ( hawkes ) processes can be pertinent to model the microstructure of the price and in particular to reproduce the shape of the signature plot and the epps effect .",
    "our goal is to extend this framework in order to account for the market impact of market orders . in that respect , the main ideas proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite can be reconsidered within the more realistic framework of point processes where correlations and impact are interpreted as cross and self excitations mechanisms acting on the conditional intensities of poisson processes .",
    "this allows us to make a step towards the definition of a faithful model of price microstructure that accounts for most recent empirical findings on the liquidity dynamical properties and to uncover new features .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : defmodel ] we show how market order impact can be naturally accounted within the class of multivariate hawkes processes . our main model for price microstructure and market impact is presented and its stability is studied .",
    "numerical simulations of the model are presented . in section [ covmatrix ] ,",
    "the microstructure of price and market order flows are studied through the covariance matrix of the process .",
    "our results are illustrated on numerical simulations .",
    "an extension of the model that accounts for labeled agents is defined in section [ m11 ] and results on market impact are presented in section [ sec : mi ] including an explanation on how the newly defined framework allows one to estimate the market impact profile from non labeled data .",
    "section [ sec : estimation ] shows how kernels defining the dynamics of trade occurrences and price variations can be nonparametrically estimated .",
    "all the theoretical results obtained in the previous sections are illustrated in section [ sec : empirical ] when applied on various high frequency future data .",
    "it allows one to reveal the different dynamics involved in price movements , market order flows and market impact .",
    "intraday seasonalities are shown to be taken care in a particularly simple way .",
    "we also discuss , on a semi - qualitative ground , how the market efficiency can be compatible with the observed long - range correlation in supply and demand without any parameter adjustment .",
    "conclusion and prospects are reported in section [ conclusion ] while technical computations are provided in appendices .",
    "as recalled in the introduction , in order to define a realistic microstructure price model while accounting for the impact of market orders , the framework of multivariate self - excited point processes is well suited .",
    "a natural approach is to associate a point process to each set of events one wants to describe .",
    "we choose to consider all market order events and all mid - price change events .",
    "let us point out that we will not take into account the volumes associated to each market orders . though this can be basically done within the framework of _ marked _ the point processes , it would necessitate cumbersome notations and make the estimation much more difficult .",
    "this issue be discussed briefly in section [ conclusion ] and addressed in a forthcoming work .",
    "the arrivals of the market orders are represented by a two dimensional counting process @xmath9 representing cumulated number of market orders arrived before time @xmath10 at the best ask ( @xmath11 ) and at the best bid ( @xmath12 ) . each time there is a market order , either @xmath13 or @xmath14 jumps up by 1 .",
    "we suppose that the trade process will be referred indifferently to as the market order arrival process or the trade arrival process . ]",
    "@xmath15 is a counting process that is fully defined by    * @xmath16 the conditional intensity vector of the process @xmath17 at @xmath10 .",
    "the price is represented in the same way .",
    "let @xmath18 represents a proxy of the price at high - frequency ( e.g. , mid - price ) .",
    "as in refs .",
    "@xcite we write @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( resp .",
    "@xmath21 ) represents the number of upward ( resp .",
    "downward ) price jumps at time @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath22 ) for any upward ( reps .",
    "downward ) jumps ] thus , each time the price goes up ( resp .",
    "down ) , @xmath23 ( resp .",
    "@xmath24 ) jumps up by 1 .",
    "we set @xmath25 as for the trade process , @xmath26 is fully defined by    * @xmath27 the conditional intensity vector of the process @xmath26 at @xmath10 .",
    "the 4 dimensional counting process is then naturally defined as @xmath28 as well as its associated conditional intensity vector @xmath29      basically , the model consists in considering that the 4-dimensional counting process @xmath30 is a hawkes process @xcite .",
    "the structure of a hawkes process allows one to take into account the influence of any component in @xmath30 on any component of @xmath31 . in its general form the model is represented by the following equation will introduce a generalization of this model including labeled trades . ]",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 is a @xmath34 matrix whose elements are _ causal _ positive functions ( by _ causal _ we mean functions supported by @xmath35 ) .",
    "moreover , we used the  matrix convolution \" notation , @xmath36 where @xmath37 refers to the regular matrix product .",
    "@xmath38 accounts for the exogenous intensity of the trades , it has the form @xmath39 since , by symmetry we assume that the exogenous intensity of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are equal while mid - price jumps are only caused by the endogenous dynamics .",
    "the matrix @xmath40 or any of its sub - matrices ( or element ) are often referred to as hawkes kernels .",
    "each element describes the influence of a component over another component .",
    "thus , it is natural to decompose the @xmath41 kernel @xmath33 in four @xmath42 matrices in the following way @xmath43 where    * @xmath44 ( influence of @xmath15 on @xmath45 ) : accounts for the trade correlations ( e.g. , splitting , herding ,  ) . *",
    "@xmath46 ( influence of @xmath15 on @xmath47 ) : accounts for the impact of a single trade on the price * @xmath48 ( influence of @xmath49 on @xmath47 ) : accounts for the influence of past changes in price on future changes in price ( due to cancel and limit orders only , since changes in price due to market orders are explicitly taken into account by @xmath46 ) * @xmath50 ( influence of @xmath49 on @xmath45 ) : accounts for _ feedback _ influence of the price moves on the trades .",
    "if we account for the obvious symmetries between bid - ask sides for trades and up - down directions for price jumps these matrices are naturally written as : @xmath51 and @xmath52 where all @xmath53 are causal functions and the upperscripts @xmath54 and @xmath55 stand for `` self '' and `` cross '' influences of the poisson rates ( we use the same convention which was initially introduced in @xcite for @xmath56 ) .",
    "thus , for instance , on the one hand , @xmath57 accounts for the influence of the past buying ( resp . selling ) market orders on the intensity of the future upward ( reps .",
    "downward ) price jumps . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath58 quantifies the influence of the past buying ( resp . selling ) market orders on the intensity of the future downward ( resp .",
    "upward ) price jumps .",
    ".2 cm * remark 1 :* all these @xmath42 matrices commute since they diagonalize in the same basis ( independently of @xmath10 ) .",
    "their eigenvalues are the sum ( resp .",
    "the difference ) of the self term with the cross term .",
    "this property will be used all along the paper .",
    "most of the computations will be made after diagonalizing all the matrices .",
    "it is important to point out that a buying market order that eats up the whole volume sitting at best ask results in an  instantaneous \" change in the mid - price . from our model point of view , it would mean that @xmath15 and @xmath49 have simultaneous jumps with a non zero probability .",
    "it is clearly not allowed as is by the model . however , from a numerical point of view , this can be simulated by just considering that the jump in the price takes place within a very small time interval ( e.g. , of width 1ms which is the resolution level of our data ) after the market order has arrived .",
    "there is no ambiguity in the  direction \" of the causality : it is a market order that makes the price change and not the other way around .",
    "this would result in an impact kernel @xmath57 which is  impulsive \" , i.e. , localized around 0 , actually close to a dirac distribution @xmath59 .    from a practical numerical point of view , choosing @xmath57 to be a dirac distribution is fairly easy .",
    "it basically amounts to considering that it is a positive function of given @xmath60 norm @xmath61 and with a support @xmath62 of the order of a few milliseconds .",
    "let us point out that it means that , the price increment between the moment of the trade and @xmath62 milliseconds afterwards , follows a poisson law whose parameter is @xmath61 .",
    "this actually allows price jumps ( spread over a few milliseconds ) of several ticks ( greater than @xmath63 ) .",
    "of course , from a mathematical point of view , this is not that simple .",
    "the limit @xmath64 has to be defined properly .",
    "this will be rigorously defined and extensively discussed in a future work and is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "the `` practical '' approach described above and the fact that we can formally replace , in all the computations , @xmath57 by a @xmath65 is far enough for our purpose .",
    "it is clear that we expect to find an impulsive component in @xmath57 when estimating on real data .",
    "though , a priori , we do expect also a non singular component that could have a large support ( e.g. , when the marker order eats up only a part of the volume sitting at best ask ) , we will see in estimations that most of the energy of @xmath57 is localized around 0 .",
    "moreover , we will find that @xmath58 is close to 0 .",
    "all these remarks will lead us to study a particularly interesting case of the previously defined model for which    * @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "consequently    * @xmath68 , where @xmath69 refers to the identity matrix .",
    "this model will be referred in the following as the impulsive impact kernel model .    before moving on and study the conditions for our model to be well defined , we need to introduce some notations that will be used all along the paper .",
    "let us introduce the following notations :    if @xmath70 is a function @xmath71 refers to the laplace transform of this function , i.e. , @xmath72 @xmath59 refers to the dirac distribution , consequently @xmath73 moreover , we will use the convenient convention ( which holds in the laplace domain )  :  @xmath74 .",
    "+ the @xmath60 norm of @xmath75 is referred to as : @xmath76 thus @xmath77 we extend these notations to matrix of functions .",

    "the process @xmath30 defined in section [ m1 ] is well defined as long as the matrix @xmath33 is locally integrable on @xmath35 .",
    "hawkes , in his original papers @xcite , has formalized the necessary and sufficient condition for the previously introduced model to be stable : the matrix made of the @xmath60 norm of the elements of @xmath40 should have eigenvalues whose modulus are strictly smaller than 1 .",
    "this condition can be expressed in terms of conditions on the @xmath60 norm of the different kernels :    * ( stability condition ) * [ prop : stability ] the hawkes process @xmath30 is stable if and only if the following condition holds :    * the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath99 have a modulus strictly smaller than 1 .    in that case",

    "moreover ( h ) holds if and only if @xmath100 where    * @xmath101 , * @xmath102 and * @xmath103 .",
    "moreover implies that @xmath104 where we used notations [ not : delta ]    the proof is in section [ proofstab ] .",
    ".2 cm let us point out that in the case there is no feedback of the price jumps on the trades , i.e. , @xmath105 ( or @xmath106 ) , then the stability condition is equivalent to @xmath107 and @xmath108 , i.e. , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    ".4 cm the mean intensity vector is given by the following proposition .",
    "* ( mean intensity ) * [ prop : lambda ] we suppose that ( h ) holds ( i.e. , ) .",

    "we chose to use a thinning algorithm ( as proposed , e.g. , in @xcite ) that consists in generating on @xmath126 $ ] an homogeneous poisson process with an intensity @xmath127 } ( \\lambda^{t\\pm}_t,\\lambda^{n^\\pm}_t)$ ] .",
    "a thinning procedure is then applied , each jump being accepted or rejected according to the actual value of @xmath128 or @xmath129 . in order to illustrate the 4-dimensional process we chose to display only the price path @xmath130 and the _ cumulated trade process",

    "the model we introduced above can be seen as a generalization of the price microstructure model previously introduced in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the 2-dimensional model defined in @xcite can somewhat be seen as the `` projection '' on the price components @xmath26 of the model defined in section [ m1 ] .",
    "thus , it easy to show that it will account for all the price microstructure stylized facts already accounted for by the model in @xcite .",
    "this includes the characteristic decreasing shape of the _ mean signature plot _",
    "@xmath139 ( which explains why estimating the diffusing variance using high frequency quadratic variations leads to a systematic positive bias ) .",
    "as explained in @xcite , this effect is due to the high frequency strong mean reversion observed in real prices and can easily be modeled by choosing kernels such that @xmath140 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for all the discussions concerning the signature plot , the problem of variance estimation using high frequency data and the link with mean reversion of price time - series .",
    "thus , in this section , we shall mainly focus one price correlations and market order correlations and how they relate one to the other .",
    "following @xcite , we define the covariance matrix of the normalized process at scale @xmath141 and lag @xmath142 by @xmath143 where we normalized by @xmath141 in order to avoid a trivial scale dependence .",
    "let us note that , since the increments of @xmath30 are stationary ( we suppose that is satisfied ) , the previous definition does not depend on @xmath10 .",
    "thus , it can be rewritten as @xmath144 in @xcite , it is proven that the the laplace transform of @xmath145 can be expressed as a function of the laplace transform of @xmath146 ( where @xmath147 ) and of @xmath148 : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the diagonal matrix @xmath151 from this result , one can easily deduce an analytical formula for the price auto - covariance function .    * ( price auto - covariance ) * let @xmath152 be the normalized auto - covariance of the price increment : @xmath153 then @xmath154    before proving this proposition , we first need the following lemma , which is a direct consequence of and .

    "the trade arrival process @xmath15 models _ anonymous _ trades sent by _ anonymous agents _  : this corresponds to the typical trade information sent by most exchanges ( i.e. , the trades are _ unlabeled _ , there is no way to know whether two different trades involves the same agent or not ) .",
    "however , there are many situations where one has access to some _ labeled _ data corresponding to some specific _ labeled agents_. in this case , it could be very interesting to be able to analyze the impact of these labeled trades within the same framework .",
    "it is naturally the case of brokers who have labels for all their clients ( though some clients may have several brokers , consequently a given broker might not be able to identify _ all _ the trades of a given client ) . in general ,",

    "the estimation procedure of the kernels can follow the exact same procedure described in section [ sec : estimation ] .",
