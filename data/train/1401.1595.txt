    "the past decade has witnessed the discovery of many charmed and charmed - strange states such as @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite/@xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite/@xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite/@xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite/@xmath16 @xcite , and @xmath17 @xcite , which have not only enriched the family of the charmed and charmed - strange states , but also stimulated extensive discussions of their properties ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a mini review of the research status of these newly observed charmed and charmed - strange states ) .",
    "the present situation of the experimental exploration of bottom and bottom - strange states is strikingly similar to that of charmed and charmed - strange states in 2003 ; i.e. , some candidates for the p - wave bottom and bottom - strange meson were announced @xcite while the radially excited states seem whitin reach @xcite . very recently , the cdf collaboration studied the orbitally excited @xmath1 mesons , and reported that the new @xmath18 state could be the radially excited state in the bottom meson family @xcite",
    ". there are several theoretical studies of the bottom and bottom - strange mesons before @xcite and after @xcite the experimental observation of these states .",
    "now is a good time to carry out a comprehensive theoretical study on higher bottom and bottom - strange mesons . in this work",
    ", we will calculate the mass spectrum of higher bottom and bottom - strange mesons and the corresponding two - body strong decay behavior .",
    "we hope the present investigation may not only shed light on the properties of the observed bottom and bottom - strange states , but also provide valuable clues to further experimental exploration of the radially and orbitally excited bottom and bottom - strange states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the introduction , we present the analysis of the mass spectrum of the bottom and bottom - strange meson family in comparison with the available experimental data and other theoretical results . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we discuss the two - body strong decay behavior of the higher bottom and bottom - strange mesons . the last section is devoted to the discussion and conclusion .",
    "we first calculate the mass spectrum of the higher bottom and bottom - strange mesons in the framework of the relativistic quark model @xcite , where the total hamiltonian @xmath19 describes the interaction between quark and anti - quark in the meson @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the confinement term and @xmath22 is the spin - orbit term which can be decomposed into the symmetric part @xmath23 and the antisymmetric part @xmath24}^{\\text{so } } $ ] . in addition , @xmath25 is the sum of the tensor and contact terms , i.e. , @xmath26 the concrete forms of these terms can be found in appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the bases @xmath27 , the antisymmetric part of the spin - orbit term @xmath24}^{\\text{so } }",
    "$ ] and the tensor term @xmath28 have nonvanishing off - diagonal elements , which result in the mixing of the states with quantum numbers @xmath29 and @xmath30 or with @xmath29 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the total hamiltonian @xmath19 can be divided into two parts in this bases , which include the diagonal part @xmath32 and off - diagonal part @xmath33 with the form @xmath34}^{\\text{so}}+\\left(\\tilde{h}^{\\text{tensor}}_{12}\\right)_{\\text{off}},\\ ] ] where @xmath35 denotes the off - diagonal parts of @xmath36 . in the following , we first diagonalize @xmath32 in the simple harmonic oscillator bases and obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors corresponding to the wave function of the meson .",
    "one also needs to diagonalize the off - diagonal part @xmath33 in the bases @xmath27 , which is treated as the perturbative term .",
    "we neglect the perturbative term @xmath37 in the present calculation .",
    "the free parameters of the adopted relativistic quark model are listed in table ii of ref .",
    "@xcite , which include the quark masses and the coefficients in the effective potential . here",
    ", we list the quark masses @xmath38 which are also applied in the following two - body strong decay calculation .    with the above preparation",
    ", we obtain the mass spectra of the bottom and bottom - strange meson families as shown in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] , where the masses of the @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 states are given .",
    "calculated the mass spectrum of some of the bottom and bottom - strange mesons long ago @xcite .",
    "we also notice that there exist predictions of the mass spectra of the bottom and bottom - strange mesons using other theoretical models .",
    "for example , ebert _ et al .",
    "_ adopted the relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach @xcite while the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used the relativistic quark model with the dirac hamiltonian potential , where the correction of @xmath47 in the potential is also included .",
    "in addition , in refs .",
    "@xcite the masses of the radial excitations of @xmath48/@xmath49/@xmath1/@xmath2 were predicted , which are comparable with the corresponding results listed in table [ spectrum ] .    in fig .",
    "[ mass ] and table [ spectrum ] , we list our results of the mass spectra of the bottom and bottom - strange meson families , the results from other groups , and compare them with the experimental data .    c    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "inspired by the recent experimental observation of the orbital excitation @xmath0 for the first time by cdf collaboration @xcite , we have carried out a systematic study of the higher @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "we have calculated both the masses of the higher @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons and their ozi - allowed two - body strong decay patterns .    at present , the status of studying @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons is very similar to that of the @xmath48 and @xmath49 mesons in 2003 . in the past several years , cdf , d0 , and lhcb collaborations have played a very important role in the study of the radial and orbital excitations of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 meson families .",
    "the higher radial and orbital excitations of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons begin to emerge in experiment . in the coming years",
    ", lhcb has the potential to discover more and more excited @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "hopefully our present investigation will be helpful to future experimental searchs for these interesting heavy mesons .",
