    "one of the problems of the nucleon spin structure is the origin of the orbital angular momentum of the gluon field . in this paper , we offer the following model of the orbital angular momentum in a quantum bag .",
    "the su(3 ) gauge potential @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) can be decomposed on @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the non - perturbative interaction between quantum components @xmath10 and @xmath11 leads to the appearance of a pure quantum bag @xcite . we will show that in this bag one can place color electric and magnetic fields ( arising from @xmath1 ) in such a way that an orbital angular momentum appears which is confined in the bag .",
    "the idea presented here that the gluonic field @xmath12 with different @xmath13 may have a different behaviour is not a new idea .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the similar idea is stated on the language of `` valence gluon field @xmath14 and background field @xmath15 '' and as a result the behaviour of field correlators @xmath16 and @xmath17 is obtained at small and large distances for perturbative and non - perturbative parts .    recently @xcite-@xcite it is shown that the condensate @xmath18 may play very important role in qcd . in the present paper",
    "we will show that this condensate is absolutely necessary to describe the quantum bag , in which some almost - classical color field is confined .",
    "in this section the decomposition of @xmath20 gauge field to the subgroup @xmath21 is defined . starting with the @xmath20 gauge group with generators",
    "@xmath22 , we define the @xmath20 gauge fields @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be a subgroup of su(3 ) and @xmath25 is a coset",
    ". then the gauge field @xmath26 can be decomposed as follows : @xmath27 where the indices @xmath28 are su(3 ) indices ; @xmath29 belongs to the subgroup su(2 ) and @xmath30 belongs to the coset @xmath25 . on this basis",
    ", the field strength can be decomposed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 where @xmath33 are structure constants of su(3 ) , @xmath34 are structure constants of su(2 ) and @xmath35 is the coupling constant .    for the non - perturbative quantization we will apply a modification of the heisenberg quantization technique to the su(3 ) yang - mills equations . in quantizing these classical system via heisenberg",
    "s method @xcite one first replaces classical fields by field operators @xmath36 .",
    "this yields non - linear , coupled , differential equations for the field operators .",
    "one then uses these equations to determine expectation values for the field operators @xmath37 ( _ e.g. _ @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is some quantum state ) .",
    "one can also use these equations to determine the expectation values of operators that are built up from the fundamental operators @xmath37 .",
    "for example , the `` electric '' field operator @xmath41 giving the expectation @xmath42 .",
    "the simple gauge field expectation values , @xmath43 , are obtained by taking the expectation of the operator version of yang - mills equations with respect to some quantum state @xmath40 .",
    "one problem in using these equations to obtain expectation values like @xmath44 , is that these equations involve not only powers or derivatives of @xmath44 ( _ i.e. _ terms like @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) but also contain terms like @xmath47 .",
    "starting with the operator version of yang - mills equations one can generate an operator differential equation for the product @xmath48 thus allowing the determination of the green s function @xmath49 .",
    "however this equation will in turn contain other , higher - order green s functions .",
    "repeating these steps leads to an infinite set of equations connecting green s functions of ever increasing order .",
    "this procedure is very similar to the field correlators approach in qcd ( for a review , see @xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite a set of self coupled equations for such field correlators is given .",
    "this construction , leading to an infinite set of coupled , differential equations , does not have an exact analytical solution and so must be handled using some approximation .",
    "it is evident that a full and exact quantization is impossible in this case .",
    "thus we have to look for some simplification in order to obtain equations which can be analyzed .",
    "our basic aim is to cut off the infinite equations set using some simplifying assumptions .",
    "our quantization procedure will derive from the heisenberg method in which we will take the expectation of the lagrangian rather than for the equations of motions .",
    "thus we will obtain an effective lagrangian rather than approximate equations of motion .",
    "for this purpose we have to have ansatz for the following 2 and 4-points green s functions : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 the field @xmath53 remains to be almost classical field .",

    "mathematically this means that @xmath56 the subscript means that this is a classical field .",

    "@xcite , similar idea on the decomposition of initial degrees of freedom to almost - classical and quantum degrees of freedom is applied to provide calculation of the @xmath57 condensate . there",
