    "the second moment maps show that the line width dramatically increases downstream at the ends of the molecular outflow particularly in the hcn ( 43 ) emission .",

    "( 2009 ) did not detect molecular outflows associated with in the and observations .",
    "this is likely due to the limited sensitivity and the beam dilution .",

    "with the sub - arcsec resolution ( ) , we detect the very compact outflow ( @xmath02@xmath16 ) with the mass sensitivity limit of ( 3@xmath19 mass sensitivity derived from hcn ) .",
    "outflow parameters were calculated from the detected co ( 32 ) and hcn ( 43 ) emissions .",
    "note that , as we described in section 2 , the maximum detectable size with our sma observations is larger than the outflow lobe size ( @xmath18 ) , so that our observations are not significantly affected by missing flux .",

    "we use a simple analytical outflow model as described in @xcite .",
    "the comparison with these models shows that the inclination angle of 45@xmath14 as denoted by the black curves in figure 2b , can delineate the mms 6 outflow velocity structure .",
    "therefore , the outflow inclination angle of 45@xmath14 is adopted in the following discussion .    in order to compare the mms 6-main outflow properties with those derived from the other omc-2/3 outflows reported in paper i ,",

    "the estimated parameters using hcn ( 43 ) and co ( 32 ) are listed in table 1 , with / without inclination angle corrections .",
    "in the mms 6-main outflow case , hcn ( 43 ) is a better tracer of the morphology and velocity structure of the collimated molecular outflow as compared with co ( 32 ) .",
    "this may be because the central part of the mms 6-main envelope ( @xmath211500 au ) is extremely dense ( @xmath33 @xmath34 ; paper ii ) and hence , the ejected gas is better traced by the higher critical density of hcn ( 43 ) , and also because the co may suffer from self - absorption effects .",
    "hereafter , we use the outflow properties as estimated from the hcn ( 43 ) emission . nevertheless , estimated outflow parameters from hcn ( 43 ) and co ( 32 ) do not show significant differences .",
    "the high - velocity gas detected in hcn emission clearly shows the bipolar collimated structure centered at mms 6-main with a projected lobe size of 1700au ( 0.0085 pc ) for the blueshifted component and 1200 au ( 0.006 pc ) for the redshifted component with an inclination angle of 45@xmath14 .",

    "( the dynamical time becomes a factor of 1.52.3 shorter when the intensity weighted mean outflow sizes and mean gas velocities are adopted . ) the derived outflow mass and outflow size are approximately 24 orders and 13 orders of magnitude smaller than those derived for other molecular outflows previously detected in the omc-2/3 region ( * ? ? ?",

    "the molecular outflow detected in mms 6-main is the smallest and least massive bipolar outflow that has ever been observed for the intermediate - mass protostars .",

    "the projected outflow lobe size ( @xmath01000 au ) is even smaller than the outflows found in the protostellar cores in taurus ( 6000 au/18000 au for the median / mean values ; from hogerheijde 1998 ) .",
    "the smallest outflow ever reported in the previous studies is an outflow associated with a very low - luminosity object ( vellos ) , l 1014l , which has a lobe size of @xmath10500 au and outflow mass of @xmath3910@xmath4 m@xmath5 .",
    "this source is a proto - brown dwarf candidate @xcite .",
    "detected molecular outflow in mms 6-main is a factor of three larger than this outflow .",
    "however , the estimated outflow force in mms 6-main is more than two orders of magnitude larger than that estimated in l 1014l . furthermore , similarly compact molecular outflows are reported in young brown dwarf stars ; iso - oph 102 and mho5 @xcite .",
    "they have outflow lobe sizes of @xmath101000 au and outflow masses of @xmath1010@xmath4 m@xmath5 , which are similar to the outflow in mms 6-main .",
    "however , their estimated outflow forces are on the order of 10@xmath40 m@xmath5 km s@xmath3 yr@xmath3 , which is four orders of magnitude smaller than those estimated in mms 6-main .",
    "as summarized in figure 3 , the molecular outflow detected in mms 6-main is similarly compact and less massive as compared to those associated with young brown dwarfs , while the outflow force is much higher in mms 6-main .",
    "if we consider that the outflow force is correlated with the mass accretion rate as suggested in , this result indicates that mms 6-main has a much higher accretion rate than for ( proto ) brown dwarf cases .",
    "the observed outflows are usually characterized by the jet - driven bow - shock models and wind - driven shell models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the jet - driven bow shock model shows that molecular outflows consist of the ambient gas interacting with the bow - shock of the jet head , while the wind - driven model shows that molecular outflows consist of swept - up gas entrained by the wide - angle outflow .",
    "the velocity structures observed in hcn ( 43 ) emission show the immediate velocity increment at the jet head up to 25 km s @xmath3 .",
    "this clearly suggests the signature of the jet - driven bow - shock type outflow .",
    "similar velocity structures are reported in low - mass protostellar outflows in the class 0 phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the primary jets from young stars are likely launched from accretion disks around protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "magnetocentrifugal forces can produce winds with large opening - angles , while the magnetic pressure gradients ( hoop stress induced by the generated toroidal magnetic field ) eventually dominate beyond the region around the alfven radius , which provides the collimation @xcite .",
    "x - wind models can also explain both wide and collimated winds as an effect due to the density contrast within the winds @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent 3d - mhd simulations predict two distinct outflows associated with the early evolutionary stages @xcite .",
    "first case is the outflow from the first adiabatic core .",
    "these outflows have a strong magnetic field and are driven mainly by the magneto centrifugal mechanism and are guided by the hour glass - like field lines .",
    "these outflows show a wide opening - angle low - velocity outflow ( @xmath105 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "second case is the outflow from the protostar .",
    "these outflows have a weak magnetic field .",
    "they are driven by the magnetic pressure gradient force and guided by straight field lines .",
    "they have a collimated high - velocity outflow ( @xmath930 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "our observations do not have enough angular resolution to resolve the outflow launching point .",
    "hence , this experiment can not distinguish between the different launching mechanisms as proposed by theoretical models .",
    "nevertheless , the nature of the observed outflow in mms 6-main shares similarities with the outflows from protostellar cores , such as collimation , bipolarity , high - velocity gas , and bow - shocks .",
    "negative detection of the wide opening - angle low - velocity outflow as predicted in the first adiabatic core , is possibly due to the observational limits on the mass sensitivity ( section 3 ) and the detectable size ( section 2 ) .",
    "the extremely compact and less massive nature of mms 6-main suggests that it may be at the earliest evolutionary phase of the protostar , shortly after its formation .",
    "paper ii suggests that the observed density of the submillimeter source , mms 6-main , is explained by the combination of a central heating source and the surrounding warm envelope , supporting the presence of a protostellar core .",
    "an extremely compact molecular outflow was discovered toward an intermediate - mass protostellar core , mms 6-main in the omc-3 region .",
    "the velocity broadening at outflow tips , ( @xmath41 km s@xmath3 ) , indicates the bow - shock type of velocity structure . the estimated outflow lobe size ( @xmath01500 au ) , mass(@xmath010@xmath4 m@xmath5 ) , and dynamical time ( @xmath21100 yr ) ,",
    "clearly suggest that the outflow is compact , less massive , and young , while the estimated outflow force ( @xmath010@xmath4 m@xmath5 km s@xmath3 yr@xmath3 ) is similar to those derived in other omc-2/3 outflows .",
    "these results most likely suggest that the outflow is originated from a protostar ( 2nd core ) , shortly after its formation .",
    "these results are consistent with our recent sma continuum observations at 850 @xmath8 , which imply that mms 6-main is an intermediate mass protostellar core .",

    "<S> we have successfully imaged a compact molecular outflow lobe ( @xmath01500 au ) associated with mms6-main , which is also the smallest molecular outflow ever found in the intermediate - mass protostellar cores . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical time scale of this outflow is estimated to be @xmath1100 yr . </S>",
    "<S> the line width dramatically increases downstream at the end of the molecular outflow ( @xmath225 km s@xmath3 ) , and clearly shows the bow - shock type velocity structure . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated outflow mass ( @xmath010@xmath4 m@xmath5 ) and outflow size are approximately 24 orders and 13 orders of magnitude smaller , while the outflow force ( @xmath010@xmath4 m@xmath5 km s@xmath3 yr@xmath3 ) is similar , as compared to the other molecular outflows studied in omc-2/3 . </S>",
    "<S> these results show that mms 6-main is a protostellar core at the earliest evolutionary stage , most likely shortly after the 2nd core formation . </S>"
