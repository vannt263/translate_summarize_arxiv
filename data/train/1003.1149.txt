    "experiments at the frontiers of quantum mechanics and gravity are rare .",
    "i would like to explore in this essay in honor of danny greenberger and helmut rauch , situations which could lead to such experiments .",
    "the key is to understand the phenomenon of quantum incompressibility  of macroscopically coherent quantum matter in the presence of inhomogeneous , tidal gravitational fields , such as the earth s .",
    "see figure 1 .     with respect to the vertical plumb line equidistant between them .",
    "according to a distant inertial observer , the radial convergence of these objects trajectories towards the center of the earth causes them to undergo small horizontal components of acceleration @xmath0 of the radial acceleration @xmath1 .",
    "these components are equivalent to a tidal gravitational force that , in a newtonian picture , causes the two objects to converge toward one another.,width=384 ]    as an example of quantum incompressibility  during free fall of an extended quantum object ,  let us first consider the single electron of a circular rydberg atom @xcite ( ignoring electron spin ) , which is prepared in the state @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the principal quantum number , which is large , i.e. , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the maximum possible orbital angular momentum quantum number for a given @xmath3 , and @xmath6 is the maximum possible azimuthal quantum number for a given @xmath7 , i.e. , the stretch  state .",
    "the @xmath8 axis has been chosen to be the local vertical axis located at the center of mass of the atom .",
    "then the wavefunction of this electron in polar coordinates @xmath9 of the hydrogenic atom in this state is given by @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a normalization constant .",
    "the probability density associated with this wavefunction has the form of a strongly peaked distribution which lies on the horizontal @xmath12 plane , in the shape of a ring of radius @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the bohr radius .",
    "thus one recovers the bohr model of the hydrogen atom in the correspondence - principle limit of large @xmath3 .",
    "this ring - like probability distribution is illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "has a strongly peaked , ring - like probability distribution , i.e. , an electron cloud , indicated by the heavy black loop .",
    "currents in this state lead to a magnetic field @xmath15 , indicated by the directional loops .",
    "the @xmath8 axis is the local vertical axis.,width=384 ]    the question i would like to address here is this : how does the size of this atom change with time as it undergoes free fall in earth s inhomogeneous , tidal gravitational field ?",
    "the magnetic moment of the rydberg atom in the state ( [ ring - like wf ] ) is quantized , and is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the bohr magneton and @xmath3 is an integer .",
    "the electron current density in the ring - like structure of a circular rydberg atom in figure 2 is similar to that of a persistent supercurrent of cooper pairs in a superconducting ring with a quantized flux given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the flux quantum and @xmath3 is an integer .",
    "the quantum incompressibility of the ring - like structure of a circular rydberg atom , and the quantum incompressibility of the cooper pairs of electrons in a superconducting ring , both arise from the same quantum mechanical principle , namely , the single - valuedness of the wavefunction after one round trip around the ring , which follows from the condition @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the phase of the wavefunction , and @xmath22 is an integer corresponding to the state under consideration .",
    "another necessary condition for quantum incompressibility is the existence of a substantial energy gap separating the @xmath22th state from adjacent states of the system .",
    "the analogy between the rydberg atom and the superconducting ring is not a perfect one , since the selection rules for allowed transitions between adjacent states will be different in the two cases .",
    "the transitions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are electric - dipole allowed for the rydberg atom , whereas the transitions @xmath25 and @xmath26 between adjacent flux - trapping states of the superconducting ring are highly forbidden .",
    "this is because a macroscopic number of identical cooper pairs of electrons must all simultaneously jump from a state with @xmath27 units to a state with @xmath28 units or with @xmath29 units of angular momentum per electron pair .",
    "hence the persistent current of a superconducting ring is highly metastable , and does not change with time , unless a macroscopic quantum jump  occurs .",
    "if the characteristic frequency of an external perturbation , such as that of the tidal gravitational fields acting on the system during free fall in earth s gravity , is much less than the smallest energy gap of an allowed transition divided by planck s constant , then the system can not make a transition ( i.e. , a quantum jump ) out of its initial state .",
    "thus it must stay rigidly in its initial state .",
    "( for a rydberg atom with @xmath30 , this transition frequency lies in the gigahertz range , so that this assumption is well satisfied . )",
    "the size of the circular rydberg atom and the size of the persistent currents of the superconducting ring will therefore remain constant in time during perturbations arising from earth s tidal fields during free fall , apart from a sequence of possible quantum jumps  in a quantum staircase .",
    "let us show that quantum incompressibility is predicted to occur in a circular rydberg atom , starting from dewitt s minimal coupling rule .",
    "the dewitt hamiltonian for a freely falling hydrogenic atom , such as a circular rydberg atom in presence of weak electromagnetic and gravitational fields , is given in si units by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the electromagnetic vector potential , and @xmath33  is dewitt s gravitational vector potential @xcite .",
    "let us first briefly review the simpler case when a dc magnetic field is turned on without any accompanying gravitational field , i.e. , when @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian for the @xmath36 term ( the landau diamagnetism term ) is given by  @xcite @xmath37 in the symmetric gauge , where @xmath38 , for @xmath39 , and where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the unit vectors along the @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath8 axes , respectively , this yields @xmath44the energy shift in first - order perturbation theory resulting from the presence of the @xmath32 field is given by@xmath45 recalling that the wavefunction for the circular rydberg state is given by ( [ ring - like wf ] ) , the expectation value in ( [ energy a ] ) becomes @xmath46 for large values of the principal quantum number @xmath3 , where @xmath47 .",
    "it follows that the first - order energy shift of the atom in the presence of a magnetic field is @xmath48 this result implies that , in first - order perturbation theory , the size of the atom does not change in the presence of the applied dc magnetic field , in the sense that the root - mean - square transverse size of the atom , which is given by @xmath49 does not change with time during the application of the dc magnetic field .",
    "moreover , all the moments of the atomic probability distribution do not change , since the wavefunction @xmath50 remains unaltered in first - order perturbation theory in the presence of a weak applied field .",
    "furthermore , this is still true for applied magnetic fields which vary sufficiently slowly in time , so that no transitions ( i.e. , quantum jumps ) can occur out of the initial state of the system @xmath50 .",
    "the concept of the quantum incompressibility  of a rydberg atom thus is a valid concept during the application of sufficiently weak , and sufficiently slowly varying , magnetic fields .",
    "the energy shift given by ( [ a.a_energy_shift ] ) causes the atom to become a _ low - field seeker _ in inhomogeneous magnetic fields through the relationship @xmath51where @xmath52 is the force on the atom in the ring - like state ( [ ring - like wf ] ) in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "next , let us consider the more interesting case of when weak tidal gravitational fields are present without any accompanying electromagnetic fields , i.e. , when @xmath53 and @xmath54 . as before , the atom is initially prepared in the state given by ( ring - like wf ) before it is released into free fall in the earth s inhomogeneous gravitational field .",
    "the @xmath8 axis , which goes through the center of mass of the atom , is chosen to be the local vertical axis of the earth s field .",
    "the horizontal tidal gravitational fields of the earth experienced during free fall by the atom , as observed in the coordinate system of a distant inertial observer , where the @xmath12 plane is the local horizontal plane , will be given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the velocity of a freely falling , point - like test particle located at @xmath12 and observed at time @xmath57 by the distant inertial observer @xcite , @xmath0 is the horizontal component of earth s gravitational acceleration arising from the radial convergence of free - fall trajectories towards the center of the earth as seen by this observer ( see figure 1 ) , @xmath58 is the radius of the earth , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are respectively the unit vectors pointing along the @xmath42 and the @xmath43 axes , in this observer s coordinate system . in ( [ tidal h field ] ) we have assumed that the horizontal excursions of the electron in @xmath42 and @xmath43 are very small compared to the earth s radius .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian for the @xmath61 term in ( [ dewitt hamiltonian for rydberg atom ] ) is given by @xmath62 therefore , the shift in energy of the atom in the circular rydberg state , due to the earth s tidal fields given by ( [ tidal h field ] ) , is given in first - order perturbation theory by @xmath63 for large values of @xmath3 , where @xmath47 . once again , since the expectation value in ( [ energy shift for h ] ) is the mean - square transverse size of the atom , this implies that the size of the atom does not change during free fall , according to first - order perturbation theory . in other words ,",
    "the atom is quantum incompressible  in the presence of the inhomogeneous , tidal fields of the earth , just like in the case of the atom in the presence of an applied dc magnetic field , as long as transitions ( i.e. , quantum jumps ) out of the initial quantum state @xmath50  can not occur .",
    "this conclusion is valid assuming that the characteristic frequency of the applied tidal fields is much less than the gap frequency ( i.e. , the energy gap divided by planck s constant , which is typically on the order of gigahertz for @xmath64 ) corresponding to a quantum transition from the @xmath3 th state to the nearest adjacent allowed states , and assuming that the tidal gravitational field of the earth is sufficiently weak .    in the gravitational case , just as in the magnetic case ,",
    "the energy - level shift caused by the tidal perturbations arising from the earth s inhomogeneous gravitational field , leads to a force on the atom .",
    "this force causes the atom to become a _ low - field seeker _ in the inhomogeneous gravitational _ _  _ _ field of the earth through the relationship @xmath65 thus a hydrogen atom in a circular rydberg state , which is an _ extended _ quantum object , will fall slightly more slowly than a point - like classical test particle which is simultaneously released into free fall along with the atom near the center of mass of the atom in earth s inhomogeneous field .",
    "the gravitational , landau - like energy shifts of the atom given by ( energy shift for h ) are much too small to be measured directly in earth - bound experiments using current technology , but in principle they can be measured spectroscopically by monitoring the frequencies of transitions between adjacent rydberg states , for example , in a satellite laboratory which is in a highly elliptical orbit around the earth .",
    "it is therefore a genuine physical effect .",
    "one might be tempted , as a result of the force given by ( [ f_h.h ] ) , to question the universal applicability of the equivalence principle , i.e. , the _ universality _ of free fall .",
    "but it must be kept in mind that the equivalence principle applies strictly only to _ point - like _ objects , inside of which tidal effects can be neglected .",
    "this is manifestly not the case for the _ extended _ quantum systems being considered here .",
    "the analogy between the rydberg atom and superconducting ring suggests a simple experiment to test the idea of quantum incompressibility  during free fall , which can be performed in an ordinary laboratory . consider a horizontal system consisting of two superconducting cubes joined by two parallel superconducting wires to form a superconducting circuit , which is _ topologically _ equivalent to the circular rydberg atom .",
    "see figure 3 .",
    "field inside this superconducting circuit , much like in the circular rydberg atom .",
    "all dimensions of the cubes and the length of the wire are given by the same distance @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath8 axis denotes the local vertical axis passing through c.m ..",
    ",width=384 ]    when a coherent quantum connection between the two cubes is not present ( due , say , to the effect of heating coils wrapped around the midsections of both wires which drive them normal by heating them above their transition temperature , so that the coherent quantum connection between the cubes is thereby destroyed ) , the centers of masses of the two spatially separated cubes , which will have decohered with respect to each other , will follow the converging free - fall trajectories shown in figure 1 , which are inclined at a slight angle @xmath67 with respect to the vertical plumb line passing through the midpoint c.m .",
    ", with @xmath68 where @xmath66 is separation of the two cubes , which is also their dimensions ( thus chosen for simplicity ) , and @xmath58 is the radius of the earth . it should be noted that the _ decoherence _ , and therefore the _ spatially separability _ , of entangled states arising from perturbations due to the environment @xcite , is a necessary precondition for the applicability of the equivalence principle @xcite , so that here the universality of free fall can be applied to the free - fall trajectories of the _ disconnected _ superconducting cubes @xcite .    when a coherent connection _ is _ present between the two cubes , they will become a single , macroscopic quantum object like the freely - falling rydberg atom .",
    "the cooper pairs of electrons of the system will then remain motionless with respect to the midpoint c.m .",
    ", since their macroscopic wavefunction corresponds to a zero - momentum eigenstate relative to this c.m . , and therefore , by the uncertainty principle , the electrons are completely nonlocalizable within the entire , coherently connected two - cube system .",
    "the cooper pairs of electrons , like the electron in rydberg atom , will then exhibit quantum incompressibility  during free fall .",
    "this follows from the fact that the wavefunction remains unaltered by the perturbation , and that therefore all moments of the probability distribution , and hence the mean - squared size of the coherent electrons of the _ entire _ superconducting system , remains unchanged in response to the tidal gravitational fields of the earth , according to first - order perturbation theory .",
    "however , the ions , which have undergone decoherence due to the environment @xcite@xcite , are completely _ localizable _ , and therefore , by the equivalence principle , will want to follow the free - fall trajectories that converge onto the center of the earth shown in figure 1 . by contrast , the cooper pairs of electrons will remain _ coherent _ during free fall , since they are protected from decoherence by the bcs energy gap @xcite , and will therefore remain completely _ nonlocalizable _ , since they will remain in a zero - momentum eigenstate .",
    "this difference in the motion of the ions and of the cooper pairs of electrons will then lead to the charge - separation effect indicated in figure 3 , in which the ions will be extruded through the innermost faces of the cubes , because of the convergence of their radial trajectories that point towards the center of the earth , and in which the cooper pairs of electrons , which resist this convergence , will be extruded through the outermost faces of the cubes .",
    "therefore the cooper pairs of electrons in the zero - momentum eigenstate , which remain at rest rigidly with respect to the _ global _ c.m .  of the entire , coherent two - cube system , will be displaced away from the ions by a distance @xmath69 on left face of the left cube , and also on the right face of the right cube .",
    "the resulting charge configuration can be approximated by a ball - and - stick model of two charged dumbbells shown in figure 4 .     and @xmath70 are attached to rigid rods with lengths @xmath66 to form two dumbbells , which model the configuration of charges in figure 3 .",
    "the two innermost charges , both of which are @xmath70 , are separated by a distance @xmath66 .",
    "these two innermost charges dominate the coulomb force between the two dumbbells , so that the net force is a repulsive one.,width=384 ]    on the one hand , the net coulomb force between the two dumbbells in figure 4 is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a pure number on the order of unity ( this follows from dimensional considerations , since @xmath66 is the only distance scale in the problem ) .",
    "on the other hand , the tidal gravitational force between the cubes in figure 3 is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the mass of the cube ( which is mainly due to the ions ) , and @xmath75 is the horizontal component of the acceleration due to earth s gravity acting on the centers of the cubes , which is directed towards the midpoint c.m .  of the two cubes .",
    "thus , in equilibrium , @xmath76    the voltage difference between the two ends of a given dumbbell ( which is a model of the voltage difference between the opposite faces of a given cube ) is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is another pure number of the order of unity ( again , this follows from dimensional considerations , since @xmath66 is only distance scale in the problem ) .",
    "substituting the squared quantity @xmath79 obtained from ( [ beta ] ) into ( [ alpha ] ) , one gets @xmath80 solving for the voltage difference @xmath81 , one obtains @xmath82 where the characteristic free - fall voltage scale @xmath83 for characteristic experimental parameters ( @xmath84 cm , @xmath85 kg / m@xmath86 ) is given by @xmath87 which is experimentally interesting , given the reasonably large capacitances of the two - cube system .",
    "( for the geometry of the dumbbells indicated in figure 4 , the numerical values of @xmath88 and @xmath89 are , as indicated earlier , on the order of unity . )",
    "the order - of - magnitude estimate given above indicates that experiments are feasible .",

    "michael scheibner , my graduate students , steve minter , luis martinez , and bong - soo kang , an undergraduate student , phil jensen , my colleague at boston university , prof .",
    "kirk wegter - mcnelly , and i , are presently performing a cavendish - like  experiment , in which we are producing a slowly time - varying , inhomogeneous , tidal gravitational field by means of two piles of lead bricks placed diametrically opposite each other on a slowly rotating , circular platform , as the sources of the field .",
    "the two piles of bricks , which weigh approximately a ton , will orbit slowly and symmetrically around a superconducting circuit similar to the one shown in figure 3 , which is mounted inside a stationary dilution refrigerator that is suspended above the center of the rotating platform .",
    "we expect to be able to see ( using synchronous detection ) the charge separation induced by these gravitational fields in a superconducting circuit , which consists of two well - separated superconducting bodies , both of which are suspended by means of pairs of superconducting wires inside the same refrigerator , so that the two bodies form the superconducting plumb bobs of two pendula .",
    "these two bodies are then _ coherently _ connected to each other by means of a pair of parallel superconducting wires , as indicated in figure 3 , to form a single superconducting circuit , i.e. , a single quantum entity .",
    "the charge separation effect can then be measured inductively by means of a sensitive electrometer ( we should be able to see the charge induced by the extruded cooper pairs , which should be on the order of picocoulombs , with a high signal - to - noise ratio ) . if we should observe a nonzero charge - separation signal in this experiment , then this observation would establish the existence of a novel coupling between gravity and electricity mediated by means of macroscopic quantum matter .",
    "normally , i.e. , for plumb bobs made out of non - superconducting materials , the gravitational fields due to the ton of bricks should cause small angular deflections on the order of nanoradians of the two pendula .",
    "these small deflections should occur relative to the local vertical axis which is located at the midpoint in between them ( see figure 1 , in which the two freely - falling objects are replaced by the two plumb bobs of the two pendula )",
    ". we would normally expect to see such deflections if these two pendula consisted of normal , classical matter , or if they consist of two superconducting plumb bobs which have had their superconducting connection between them destroyed due to decoherence .",
    "such deflections could be measured with high signal - to - noise ratios using laser interferometry .",
    "if we were to monitor both the deflections of the pendula and the charge separation effect in the same experiment , there would be four logical possibilities as to the possible outcomes :            based on the arguments presented above , we would expect ( i ) to be the outcome , if the cooper pairs were to be able to drag the ions of the lattice into co - motion with these superconducting electrons during free fall . in the tug - of - war between",
    "the uncertainty principle and the equivalence principle , the uncertainty principle wins in ( i ) .",
    "by contrast , if there is nothing special about this superconducting system over any other material system , i.e. , if the universality of free fall were to apply to the cooper pairs inside the superconducting circuit so that they would undergo free fall along with the ions , and that therefore the superconducting system would remain electrically neutral and unpolarized during free fall , then we would expect ( ii ) to be the outcome .",
    "the equivalence principle wins in ( ii ) .",
    "if , however , there does exist a charge - separation effect , but the ions of the lattice were to drag the cooper pairs into co - motion with the ionic lattice during free fall , then we would expect ( iii ) to be the outcome .",
    "finally , there exists the remote possibility of outcome ( iv ) , which would indicate that newtonian gravity would somehow have failed to produce any deflection at all of the pendula in the presence of the ton of bricks .",
    "results from this cavendish - likeexperiment will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in addition to the @xmath36 and the @xmath90 terms , there are also @xmath91 and @xmath92 terms in the perturbation hamiltonian . however , these latter terms lead to energy shifts which vanish in the limit that @xmath93 in comparison with the former . for details , see r.y .",

    "minter , and k. wegter - mcnelly ( in preparation ) .",
    "the general relativistic concept of a geodesic  is fundamentally that of a classical trajectory .  as bohr has taught us , however , the very concept of a classical trajectoryloses all physical meaning under circumstances in which the uncertainty principle destroys all such classical trajectories",
    "this is the case here for the free - fall trajectories of cooper pairs inside the superconducting system , since these electron pairs will remain in a _",
