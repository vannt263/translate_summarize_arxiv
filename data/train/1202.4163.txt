    "in particular , y. hatsugai reveals the relationship between chern number and edge states in the iqhe,@xcite which provides another way from the edge state to understand the topological order in finite systems.@xcite moreover , the successful synthesis of nano and novel materials , such as the triangular organic material @xmath4,@xcite the kagome lattice herbertsmithite@xcite and the three - dimensional hyperkagome lattice magnet @xmath5,@xcite provide many opportunities to examine theoretically and experimentally some novel physical properties , including the topological properties,@xcite fractionalized excitation@xcite , singlet valence - bond solid states,@xcite , and edge states .",
    "theoretically , these materials can be mapped to novel geometric lattices , such as the star lattice which is also called the triangle - honeycomb lattice@xcite , fisher lattice or decorated honeycomb lattice.@xcite these geometric lattice models provide a new view to understand the geometric effect and spin frustration.@xcite in particular , the spin models on the star and honeycomb lattices have shown many novel phases including the abelian and non - abelian anyons , chiral spin - liquid phases , topological orders , @xcite , magnetic orders@xcite , and topological insulator.@xcite    the iqhe reveals some novel transport properties of electrons in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems , in which the edge states play a key role and the hall conductance can be expressed in terms of chern number.@xcite interestingly , the bulk - edge correspondence discovered by y. hatsugai @xcite becomes an efficient method to explore the edge states in various 2d systems , such as the honeycomb lattice ( graphene)@xcite and spin - chiral ferromagnetic kagome lattice.@xcite however , the star lattice consists of a special lattice geometry , which can be mapped to a class of materials and cold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "the mean field study of heisenberg model demonstrates the existence of several spin liquid phases , which depend on the flux configurations of two triangles and one dodecagon in the unit cell.@xcite a natural question arises : what is the relationship between the spin liquid phases and edge states on the star lattice with boundaries ?     and @xmath6 .",

    "we begin with a 2d tight - binding model with the hund s rule coupling .",
    "it can be mapped to an effective tight - binding spinless model.@xcite the mean field approach predicts that there exists several spin liquid phases in the ground states with the local time reversal symmetry breaking.@xcite we use the bulk - edge correspondence method to analyze the edge states and their topological orders on the star lattice with boundaries .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the tight - binding model with boundaries and map it to a spinless tight - binding model . in sec .",
    "iii , we give the bulk - edge correspondence for the star lattice .",

    "the magnetic flux configurations are labeled by @xmath10 $ ] following ref .",
    "in order to understand the relationship between the lattice geometry , edge states , and their topological properties , we consider the star lattice with boundaries , in which the conducting electrons move in a local spin background and couple with them by the hund s rule to form a double - exchange system . the corresponding tight - binding hamiltonian can be written as , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hopping amplitude between two nearest neighboring sites @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator on site i with spin @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is the local spin on site i , which couples with the conducting electron spins with the effective coupling constant @xmath17 .",
    "we consider that the local spins are approximately classical and the coupling @xmath17 is strong enough to have the hoping electrons to align them to the local spin @xmath18 on each site with the spinon function , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are the spinon parameters . in this spinon representation , the hamiltonian eq.([eq : originalhamilton ] ) can be mapped to an effective tight - binding hamiltonian , @xmath21 where the effective hopping amplitude@xcite @xmath22e^{ia_{ij}}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & t(\\theta_{ij},\\phi_{ij})e^{ia_{ij}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the phase @xmath23 is the vector potential generated by spin and corresponds to the berry phase felt by the hopping electron .",
    "it is noted that the unit cell of the star lattice contains two triangular plaquettes and one 12-site dodecagon plaquette .",
    "the mean field study of heisenberg model on the star lattice has revealed the existence of several spin liquid phases.@xcite the spin liquid phases depend on the flux figuration of the unit cell , which is labeled by the notation @xmath10$].@xcite in terms of the original spin variable , the fluxes on the triangular plaquettes correspond to the scalar spin chiralities @xmath24 , while @xmath25 is related to the 12 spins around the dodecagon loop . in the uniform spin liquid phase , @xmath26 $ ] , @xmath27 .",

    "however in the mean field approximation , @xmath30 should be independent on the angles,@xmath32 for the spin liquid phases because the fluxes through plaquettes are periodic in the whole lattice.@xcite thus the hopping parameters @xmath33 can be classified into two independent variables on the star lattice .",
