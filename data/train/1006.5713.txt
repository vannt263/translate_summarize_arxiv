    "we show the values obtained both from using only systems with optical depths less than one at the lyman edge ( dashed line ) and from using all the systems regardless of their optical depths ( solid line ) .",
    "the monte carlo simulations also allow us to estimate the uncertainty introduced by the finite number of systems we are observing . for the case where we used all the systems regardless of their optical depth , we also show with dotted lines the range of corrections that we found in 20 computations using only 60 lines of sight ( which is roughly equal to the number of lines of sight in the present sample ; we have 53 systems at @xmath8 and 63 at @xmath9 ) . at the shorter wavelengths this corresponds to about a 10% uncertainty in the correction .",
    "the large range is a consequence of the small number of systems which contribute to the opacity at @xmath81 .",
    "the uncertainty in the correction for the @xmath82 systems only is much smaller ( about 3% or less ) .",
    "this is because there is a much larger number of low column density systems , and hence the correction is better averaged even in a small number of lines of sight .",
    "we have applied the correction in two ways . in the first we excluded the small number of quasars with measured llss in their spectra using the list in songaila & cowie ( 2010 ) .",
    "we corrected for the missing light from these agns by proportionally reducing the observed area .",

    "the advantage of this method is that it minimizes the correction and also avoids the statistical uncertainties in the @xmath81 correction .",
    "however , we may fail to identify llss in the fainter and noisier spectra .",
    "we have therefore also computed the vem from the full quasar sample ( i.e. , not excluding systems with llss ) . in this case",
    "we apply the full correction , including the opacity from the @xmath81 systems . in figure",
