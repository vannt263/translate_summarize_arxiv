    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) geometrically frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnets ( afms ) are potential candiadates in the search of spin liquids ( spin - disordered states ) from both theoretical and experimental considerations . the first suggested candidate for spin",
    "liquid is the triangular lattice with nearest - neighbor ( nn ) couplings , but unfortunately it was finally revealed to exhibit @xmath4 spin long - range order by extensive studies @xcite .",
    "people began to resort to interactions beyond the nn coupling to realize the spin - disordered state .",
    "another potential candidate is the kagom afm @xcite .",
    "it has been already known that there are two possible ordered states in this system , the so - called @xmath0 state and @xmath2 state @xcite ( fig .",
    "1 ) , while numerical studies do not support any long range orders for the spin-1/2 system zeng , chalker .",
    "this debate is still going on since numerical studies are usually limited to finite lattices .",
    "it was also investigated extensively whether the excitation spectra are gapless or not even if the system is disordered",
    ". numerical study with up to @xmath5 spins gives an estimation of the energy gap smaller than @xmath6 of the exchange interaction @xcite . in a scenario of valence bond crystal with translational symmetry breaking , the gap of the system is found to be very small @xcite .",
    "experimentally , several kagom - like systems have been found broholm .",
    "one of the most intriguing experimental results is the large @xmath7 coefficient of the specific heat of spin-@xmath8 srcr@xmath9ga@xmath10o@xmath11 @xcite , which suggests that a large linear term exists in the density of states ( dos ) , @xmath12 .",
    "a numerical study of the spin-@xmath13 system suggests that the @xmath14 law of the specific heat can be inferred from the heisenberg hamiltonian with the nn couplings at very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "a contractor renormalization calculation finds a columnar dimer order and re - produces the @xmath14 specific heat for the spin-@xmath13 system , but it still can not tell whether it is gapless or not @xcite .",
    "a very recent projected wavefunction study suggests that the gapless mode may be missed due to the limitation of finite lattice sites , and the gapless u(@xmath15)-dirac state produces the @xmath14 specific heat @xcite .",
    "so far many aspects of the ground state remain to be mysteries .    in the theoretical aspect",
    ", it was known that the schwinger - boson mean - field theory ( sbmft ) may provide a reliable description for both quantum ordered and disordered antiferromagnets based on the picture of the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state @xcite . as a merit",
    ", it does not prescribe any long - range order for the ground state in advance , which should emerge naturally if the schwinger bosons condense at low temperatures .",
    "it was supposed that such a mean - field theory should be reliable for large spins where quantum fluctuation is believed to be weak . the theory has successfully captured the long - range order ( lro ) of the heisenberg antiferromagnets on the square @xcite and triangular @xcite lattices at zero temperature , and is in excellent agreement with the mermin - wagner theorem even for small spins . of course , it also has shortcomings , such as it predicts wrongly an energy gap for a one - dimensional half - integer spin chains @xcite . in previous works ,",
    "sbmft had been already applied to the kagom system .",
    "_ gave a schwinger - boson approach to the @xmath0 state and @xmath2 state by including a third neighbour interaction @xcite .",
    "in a recent work by wang , a new quantum disordered state is proposed for the systems with physical spin values if ring exchange interactions are introduced @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we employ sbmft to study the heisenberg antiferromagnet with physical spin values on the kagom lattice in a different approach and discover some features of the system quantities .",
    "the gauge freedom due to the geometry gives two solutions corresponding to two different types of the states sachdev .",
    "the first solution gives the @xmath0 ordered state while the second solution gives a mixed state with @xmath0 order and @xmath16 order for @xmath17 , and a state with a very small gap for @xmath18 .",
    "it was shown that the strong quantum fluctuation of quantum spin 1/2 may destroy the order states of higher spin and drive the system to be disordered .",
    "the coexistence of two orders in a quantum state is one of the key results in this paper .",
    "this result is revealed by the detailed analysis of the static spin structure factors .",
    "for the ordered states in both solutions , we show that the low - energy spectra for the quasi - particles are linear in the momentum @xmath19 at the gapless point @xmath20 . as a result , the density of state is linear in energy , the specific heat obeys the @xmath14 law , and the uniform magnetic susceptibility is finite at zero temperature .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "the general formalism of the schwinger - boson mean field theory is presented in sec .",
    "we introduce two types of mean field parameters , and expect to capture the key features of quantum spin state on the kagome lattice .",
    "a set of mean field equation is established by means of the matsubara green function techniques . in sec .",
    "iii , the numerical solutions of the mean field equations are given .",
    "we focus on the ground state properties for the system and show that the ground state of spin 1/2 has a finite energy gap to the excited states and is spin disordered while for larger spin the ground state is spin ordered .",
    "finally , a brief discussion is presented in sec .",
    "we start with the heisenberg hamiltonian on the kagom lattice,@xmath21where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are indices of the periodic bravis lattice , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are sublattice indices , @xmath26or @xmath27 as indicated in fig",

    "note that the lattice constant is double of the triangle parameter @xmath30 and we set @xmath31 for simplicity . we choose the primitive cell and the first brillouin zone as in fig .",
    "2 . in the framework of schwinger boson theory @xcite , a pair of hard - core bosons",
    "is introduced to represent one quantum spin @xmath32 at each site , @xmath33with the constraint , @xmath34 in this representation , the hamiltonian can be expressed as@xmath35where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the number of primitive cells ( i.e. the total number of lattice sites is @xmath38 ) .",
    "the lagrange multipliers @xmath39 is introduced to realize the constraints of the number of schwinger bosons at each site . due to translational symmetry",
    ", we will set @xmath40 to simplify the problem .",
    "in the mean field approach , one can introduce the mean - field parameter @xmath41 , and decompose @xmath42 into @xmath43 where @xmath44 represents the thermodynamic average of the physical quantity .",
    "this procedure can also be formulated equivalently as the hubbard - stratanovich transformation @xcite . in a suitable gauge",
    ", the bond parameter @xmath41 can be taken to be real @xcite .",
    "notice there are two different solutions that can be obtained by the relation of the mean fields on the two adjacent triangles ( labeled as @xmath45 and @xmath46 in fig .",

    "they produce two physically distinct states that can not be transformed into each other by gauge transformations .    in both schemes",
    "the effective hamiltonian is decomposed into the quadratic form of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and the mean - field theories for the two schemes have almost the same formalism . in the following deduction",
    ", we shall point out their differences where it is appropriate .",

    "then physical quantities concerning the average of two operators can be readily expressed by the matrix elements , e.g. @xmath69 . and",
    "the physcial quantities concerning the average of four operators , such as the correlation functions , can be decomposed into the averages of two operators through the wick theorem .",
    "we shall use these facts to establish the mean - field equations and the static spin structure factors later .",

    "then the mean - field equations become ,    @xmath94    with the definitions of two integrals    [ inte ] @xmath95    first , we solve the equations at zero temperature . for the scheme ( i ) , we found the first integral is bounded from above by the value @xmath96 at @xmath97 .",
