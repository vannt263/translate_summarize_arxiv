    "the study of the properties of atoms and molecules at low temperatures has been greatly advanced by the development of particle traps , with applications in many fields of physics and chemistry @xcite .",
    "radiofrequency ( rf ) ion traps in particular have proven to be a useful tool for experiments in quantum information and the study of fundamental chemical processes due to their ability to confine a wide range of atomic and molecular ions prepared at a low temperature by laser or sympathetic cooling @xcite .",
    "the fluorescence generated during laser cooling can be captured with a ccd camera allowing the ions to be imaged .",
    "the resulting image can be compared to the results of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of the trajectories of the trapped ions allowing the number and the temperature of the trapped ions to be inferred @xcite . in reaction experiments ,",
    "this procedure is often adopted to probe the variation of the composition of the ion ensemble as a function of reaction time in order to determine reaction rate constants@xcite .",
    "two significant approximations are typically made in md simulations in order to minimize the computation time which scales quadratically with the number of trapped ions due to the pairwise coulomb force .",
    "the first of these is to implement the effects of laser cooling as a friction force neglecting the process of stimulated emission and the saturation of the force with respect to intensity and ion velocity @xcite .",
    "the second is the replacement of the various heating processes acting on the ions with a single effective heating force and fitting the strength of this force to experimental data @xcite .",
    "this approach neglects the underlying physical details of the heating sources and , in particular , replaces rare events which lead to strong heating with a continuous , weaker heating process .",
    "this converts the system from one which samples a broad range of temperatures into one in which the ions remain at an essentially fixed temperature after reaching equilibrium with only small displacements from the mean .",
    "alternative descriptions of laser cooling have previously been used ranging from stochastic photon scattering @xcite , to modeling the radiative dynamics of each particle explicitly as a two - level system in a laser beam @xcite , to tracking the quantum state of each particle throughout the simulation including multiple hyperfine levels @xcite .",
    "all of these methods have the advantage of directly introducing the heating of the particles caused by photon recoil and fluctuations in the scattering rate , whereas these must be included in an effective heating term if a frictional force is used .",
    "building on this work , we show that these two approximations can be problematic simplifications which lead to pronounced misrepresentations of the dynamics and thermal properties of the trapped ions .",
    "we introduce an md implementation of a realistic force model for trapping , laser cooling and the salient heating mechanisms which is directly based on experimental parameters without relying on the above two approximations .",
    "we show the effects of the breakdown of the friction model of laser cooling at ion velocities of relevance to experiments .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that collisions of only a single ion of the ensemble with a background gas molecule can lead to significant deviations of the secular velocities of all trapped ions from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "we compare the present theoretical results to experimental data finding excellent agreement and invoke superstatistics to provide a simple explanation for the appearance of the non - maxwellian behavior .",
    "finally , we discuss the relevance of our results to the determination of reaction rate constants and put them into context with other recent theoretical work on the collisional dynamics of trapped ions @xcite .",
    "the trapping of ions through electric fields requires a time - varying component , since the laplace equation of electrostatics forbids the formation of a three - dimensional trap using only static fields @xcite . in a quadrupole rf ion trap",
    ", confinement is achieved through combining rf and static electric fields in such a way that charged particles can be trapped in all three dimensions simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a single ion in a quadrupole rf trap are governed by the mathieu equations of motion ,    @xmath0    where @xmath1 are the ion coordinates , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are dimensionless parameters depending on the trap geometry and operating conditions , and @xmath4 is the rf frequency @xcite .",
    "when @xmath2 and @xmath3 are both much smaller than 1 , the motion of the ion can be decomposed into two components : a slow `` secular '' low frequency motion and a fast oscillating `` micromotion '' at the driving rf frequency @xcite .",

    "cooling of the ions is implemented through the scattering of photons from a laser beam slightly red detuned from an atomic resonance ( doppler laser - cooling ) @xcite . unlike in the optical - molasses cooling technique for neutral atoms",
    ", there is often only one cooling laser present in ion - cooling experiments .",
    "the motional degrees of freedom of all ions are strongly coupled through the coulomb interaction and so cooling one degree of freedom is sufficient to cool the entire ensemble .",
    "the rate @xmath12 of photons scattered by an ion through interaction with a near - resonant laser beam of detuning @xmath13 and intensity @xmath14 on a transition with natural linewidth @xmath15 and saturation intensity @xmath16 is given by @xcite :    @xmath17    the corresponding scattering force @xmath18 can be expanded in a taylor series around @xmath19 which is terminated after the linear term yielding a radiation pressure term @xmath20 and a friction force @xmath21 @xcite .",

    "the randomly - directed spontaneous emission of excited ions and random fluctuations in the number of photons absorbed per unit time both lead to a random walk of the ion velocity @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to a heating of the ions with a rate @xmath23    in the case of an rf ion trap , the laser cooling acts to reduce the secular temperature . at sufficiently low secular temperatures",
    ", the ion ensemble undergoes a phase transition to an ordered state called a coulomb crystal @xcite .",
    "the micromotion , on the other hand , is driven by the applied rf field and so can not be cooled completely , but can be reduced by careful control of shape and location of the coulomb crystal @xcite .",
    "a realistic md simulation of ions in a rf trap must take into account the range of forces experienced by the ions .",
    "these include the trapping force and coulomb repulsion between the ions as well as the laser cooling responsible for lowering their temperature .",
    "in addition to these , a number of heating processes counteract the effect of cooling such that an ion cloud reaches a finite temperature , typically in the range 10 - 100 mk @xcite .",
    "these processes can be broadly divided into four types : heating due to interaction with the laser , heating due to collisions of ions with residual background gas , heating due to ion - ion collisions , and heating due to experimental imperfections ( e.g. , machining imperfections , electronic noise and patch potentials ) .    here ,",
    "the force acting on an ion @xmath24 was represented as follows :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the time - dependent trapping potential and @xmath27 is the sum of pairwise coulomb forces acting between the ions .",
    "these two terms also implicitly account for heating by ion - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 is a term representing elastic collisions with the background gas , and @xmath29 is the force arising from interaction of the ions with near - resonant light .",

    "additionally , the probability of stimulated emission from the excited state or absorption in the ground state are given by @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the continuous rate equations for an ensemble of atoms can be converted to a probabilistic model for individual atoms .",

    "the probability of the ion changing to the other state is calculated , and this value is compared to a random number generated in the interval [ 0,1 ) to determine if a transition between the two states takes place during the timestep . when a transition occurs , the state variable of the ion is updated , and a momentum kick of magnitude @xmath46 is applied to the ion in the appropriate direction for absorption and stimulated emission and in a random direction for spontaneous emission .",
