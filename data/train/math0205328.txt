    "surgery ( or cut - and - paste topology ) is a method of modifying a manifold to another one .",
    "surgery was successfully used in the sixties to geometrically realize algebraic invariants of manifolds and leads , for example , to a classification of high dimensional manifolds of a fixed homotopy type .",
    "surgery has also been fruitfully applied to the case of embedding questions , most notably to codimension 2 embeddings , i.e. , knot theory . for an excellent survey ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this was pioneered by levine , who used surgery to geometrically realize known knot ( and link ) invariants , such as the alexander polynomial , the alexander module , and well - known concordance invariants of knots , @xcite .",
    "rolfsen used surgery for similar reasons in his reader - friendly introduction to knot theory , @xcite . the key idea behind this is the fact that knots ( or rather , knot projections ) can be unknotted via a sequence of crossing changes , and that a crossing change can be achieved by surgery on a @xmath1-framed unknot as follows :    @xmath2    thus , every knot @xmath3 in @xmath0 can be obtained by surgery on a framed link @xmath4 in the complement @xmath5 of an unknot @xmath6 .",
    "we will call such a link @xmath4 , an _ untying link _ for @xmath3 . observe that untying links are framed , and null homotopic in @xmath5 , the interior of a solid torus .",
    "further , their linking matrix is invertible over @xmath7 , since surgery on them gives rise to a .    in the above mentioned applications of surgery theory to knot theory ,",
    "one starts with a knot invariant ( such as the alexander polynomial ) with a known behavior under surgery . using this information",
    ", one can realize all values of the invariant by choosing suitable untying links on @xmath5 and performing surgery on them .",
    "this is exactly what levine , rolfsen and others did .",
    "there is one point , though , that the above literature does not usually discuss : a knot can be untied by many different links in @xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the fact that surgery is related to handlebodies that have different descriptions . if two framed links are related by a @xmath8 ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) move , then surgery on them gives rise to diffeomorphic manifolds . here",
    ", @xmath11 corresponds to adding a parallel of a link component to another , and @xmath10 corresponds to adding / removing a unit - framed unlink away from a link .",
    "the above discussion applies in the case of knots @xmath3 in _ s _ @xmath12 ( that is , closed 3-manifolds with the same @xmath7-homology as @xmath0 ) , and leads to the following _ surgery map _ :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the set of knots in homology spheres , and @xmath15 denotes the set of null homotopic links @xmath4 with @xmath7-invertible linking matrix in the complement of a standard unknot @xmath6 in @xmath0",
    ". the next theorem explains what we mean by the _ surgery view of knots_.    the surgery map is 1 - 1 and onto .",
    "the technique of proving this theorem is well - known in the seventies ; in a sense it is a relative version of kirby s theorem for manifolds with boundary .",
    "the reader may ask why did the classical literature not state the above result , and why is it of any use nowadays ?",
    "as we mentioned already , if one is interested in _ realizing _ values of known knot invariants , one needs to know that the surgery map is onto .",
    "if one is interested in _ constructing _ a knot invariant , starting from an invariant of null homotopic links in the complement of an unknot , then one needs to know the kernel of the surgery map .",
    "this is precisely the situation that we are interested in . in forthcoming work",
    "@xcite we will use the above theorem in order to construct a new knot invariant , namely a rational version @xmath16 of the kontsevich integral of a knot .",
    "this work motivated us to formulate theorem [ thm.surgeryk ] .    in a sense ,",
    "theorem [ thm.surgeryk ] defines knot theory in terms of link theory in a solid torus .",
    "one might think that this is a step in the wrong direction . however , this view of knots is closely related to the _ homology surgery _ view of knots of cappell - shaneson , @xcite .",
    "cappell and shaneson study the closed 3-manifold obtained by @xmath17 surgery on a knot .",
    "this manifold has the homology of a circle but not the @xmath7-equivariant homology of a circle .    in @xcite",
    ", we actually construct a rational invariant of @xmath18-links .",
    "boundary links ( @xmath19-links ) , and their cousins , @xmath18-links are a generalization of knots which we now explain .",
    "recall first that every knot @xmath3 in a homology sphere @xmath12 gives rise to a map @xmath20 which maps a meridian to a generator of @xmath7 .",
    "an @xmath18-_link _ is a triple @xmath21 of a link @xmath22 in a homology sphere @xmath12 , where @xmath23 is a map that sends meridians of @xmath22 to generators of the free group @xmath18 .",
    "here , @xmath18 denotes the free group in generators @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of components of @xmath22 .",
    "an @xmath18-link gives rise to a map @xmath26 and the preimage of generic points on each circle gives rise to a disjoint union of surfaces @xmath27 with boundary the @xmath28th component @xmath29 of @xmath22 .",
    "thus , @xmath30 is a _",
    "boundary link_.    it turns out that every boundary link has an @xmath18-structure , however not a canonical one . for a discussion of this ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "generalizing theorem [ thm.surgeryk ] , let @xmath6 denote a standard unlink of @xmath25 components in @xmath0 , with a canonical isomorphism @xmath31 . if @xmath4 is a null homotopic link in @xmath32 with @xmath7 invertible linking matrix , then after surgery it gives rise to an @xmath18-link @xmath21 .",
    "the next theorem describes the _ surgery view of @xmath18-links_.    the surgery map gives a 1 - 1 onto correspondence @xmath33    as we mentioned above , we will use this theorem in @xcite in order to construct a rational version of the kontsevich integral . at present",
    ", we will use the above theorem to define a noncommutative version of the alexander polynomial of an @xmath18-link , as well as a matrix - valued invariant of @xmath18-links which is essentially equivalent to the blanchfield pairing of their free cover .    consider a link @xmath34 . since @xmath35 is null homotopic , it lifts to a link @xmath36 in the free @xmath18-cover @xmath37 of @xmath38 . since @xmath37 is contractible , it follows that we can define linking numbers between the components of @xmath36 , and thus we can define the _ equivariant linking matrix _ @xmath39 of @xmath4 by : @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes a lift of a component @xmath42 of @xmath4 .",
    "the above sums are finite and @xmath39 is a matrix over the group - ring @xmath43 $ ] of @xmath18 .",
    "the size of the matrix is the number of components of @xmath4 .",
    "the equivariant linking matrix of @xmath4 is a _ hermitian matrix _ ( that is , a matrix @xmath44 over @xmath45 is that satisfies @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the transpose of @xmath44 followed by the natural involution @xmath48 ) , defined up to a minor indeterminacy that depends on the choice of lifts @xmath41 of the components of @xmath4 .",
    "a different choice of lifts replaces the linking matrix @xmath39 by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a diagonal matrix with elements of @xmath51 in the diagonal .    taking into account the kirby moves",
    ", we can define a map @xmath52 where @xmath53 and where @xmath54 denotes the set of _ simple stable congruence classes of hermitian matrices over @xmath45 , invertible over @xmath7 _",

    "unfortunately , @xmath70 does not descend to a @xmath59-valued invariant on the set @xmath71 , but it does descend to a @xmath72-valued invariant , where @xmath72 is the abelian group quotient of the abelian group @xmath59 modulo the subgroup @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath72 can be described as the free abelian group generated by cyclic words in @xmath63 variables .",
    "our next result shows that the @xmath70 invariant is a noncommutative analogue of the alexander polynomial of an @xmath18-link . as a motivation ,",
    "recall that the alexander polynomial of a knot measures the order of the first homology of the free abelian cover of its complement .",
    "given an @xmath18-link @xmath21 , we can consider the free cover @xmath75 of its complement @xmath76 , and its homology @xmath77 , which is a module over the group - ring @xmath45 .",
    "since the ring @xmath45 is not commutative ( when @xmath22 is not a knot ) , the notion of a torsion module does not make sense .",
    "however , in @xcite , levine and the first author defined an invariant @xmath78 of @xmath18-links with values in @xmath79 , the abelian group of formal power series ( with rational coefficients ) in noncommutative variables , modulo cyclic permutation .",
    "the invariant @xmath78 is a reformulation of an invariant defined earlier by farber , @xcite , and in the case of knots equals , up to a multiple , to the logarithm of the alexander polynomial .",
    "thus , @xmath78 can be thought as a _ noncommutative torsion _",
    "invariant of @xmath18-links .",
    "the next result gives an independent definition of the noncommutative torsion of an @xmath18-link , and of its blanchfield form .",
    "there exist an invariant @xmath66 of @xmath18-links with values in @xmath54 .",
