    "many of high energy theories of fundamental physics are formulated in higher dimensional spacetimes and it is commonly assumed that the extra dimensions are compactified . in particular , the idea of compactified dimensions has been extensively used in supergravity and superstring theories . from an inflationary point of view universes with compact spatial dimensions , under certain conditions , should be considered a rule rather than an exception @xcite .",
    "these models may play an important role by providing proper initial conditions for inflation ( for physical motivations of considering compact universes see also @xcite ) . as it was argued in @xcite , there are many reasons to expect that in string theory the most natural topology for the universe is that of a flat compact three - manifold .",
    "the quantum creation of the universe having toroidal spatial topology is discussed in @xcite and in references @xcite within the framework of various supergravity theories .",
    "in addition to the theoretical work , there has been a large activity to search for signatures of non - trivial topology by identifying ghost images of galaxies , clusters or quasars .",
    "recent progress in observations of the cosmic microwave background provides an alternative way to observe the topology of the universe @xcite .",
    "if the scale of periodicity is close to the particle horizon scale then the changed appearance of the microwave background sky pattern offers a sensitive probe of the topology .",
    "the compactification of spatial dimensions leads to a number of interesting quantum effects which include instabilities in interacting field theories @xcite , topological mass generation @xcite and symmetry breaking @xcite . in the case of non - trivial topology",
    "the boundary conditions imposed on fields give rise to the modification of the spectrum for vacuum fluctuations and , as a result , to the casimir - type contributions in the vacuum expectation values of physical observables ( for the topological casimir effect and its role in cosmology see @xcite ) .",
    "a characteristic feature of models with compactified dimensions is the presence of moduli fields which parametrize the size and the shape of the extra dimensions and the casimir effect has been used for the generation of the effective potential for these moduli .",
    "the casimir energy can also serve as a model for dark energy needed for the explanation of the present accelerated expansion of the universe ( see milt03,eliz06,gree07 and references therein ) .",
    "quantum field theory in de sitter ( ds ) spacetime has been extensively studied during the past two decades .",
    "much of early interest was motivated by the questions related to the quantization of fields on curved backgrounds .",
    "ds spacetime has a high degree of symmetry and numerous physical problems are exactly solvable on this background .",
    "the importance of this theoretical work increased by the appearance of  the inflationary cosmology scenario @xcite . in most inflationary models an approximately ds spacetime is employed to solve a number of problems in standard cosmology . during an inflationary epoch quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field introduce inhomogeneities and may affect the transition toward the true vacuum .",
    "these fluctuations play a central role in the generation of cosmic structures from inflation .",
    "more recently astronomical observations of high redshift supernovae , galaxy clusters and cosmic microwave background @xcite indicate that at the present epoch the universe is accelerating and can be well approximated by a world with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "if the universe would accelerate indefinitely , the standard cosmology would lead to an asymptotic ds universe .",
    "hence , the investigation of physical effects in ds spacetime is important for understanding both the early universe and its future .",
    "one - loop quantum effects for various spin fields on the background of ds spacetime have been discussed by several authors ( see , for instance , cher68-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the effects of the toroidal compactification of spatial dimensions in ds spacetime on the properties of quantum vacuum for a scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter are investigated in @xcite ( the quantum effects in braneworld models with ds spaces and in higher - dimensional brane models with compact internal spaces were discussed in @xcite ) . in the present talk , based on @xcite we present the results on the casimir effect for a fermionic field on background of ds spacetime with spatial topology @xmath0 .",

    "we consider a quantum fermionic field @xmath3 on background of @xmath1-dimensional de sitter spacetime , @xmath4 , described by the line element@xmath5where the parameter @xmath6 in the expression for the scale factor is related to the corresponding cosmological constant @xmath7 by the formula @xmath8 .",

    "in the discussion below we will denote the position vectors along the uncompactified and compactified dimensions by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "one of the characteristic features of the field theory on backgrounds with non - trivial topology is the appearance of inequivalent types of fields with the same spin @xcite .",
    "for fermion fields the boundary conditions along the compactified dimensions can be either periodic ( untwisted field ) or antiperiodic ( twisted field ) .",

    "we are interested in the effects of non - trivial topology on the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the energy - momentum tensor of the fermionic field assuming that the field is prepared in the bunch - davies vacuum state ( also called euclidean vacuum ) . in order to evaluate this vev",
