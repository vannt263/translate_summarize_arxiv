    "in theories with spontaneously broken global symmetry , the infrared ( ir ) physics is described by the nambu - goldstone particle(s ) and their interactions are restricted by the broken ( and unbroken ) symmetries .",
    "those restrictions are generically called the low - energy theorems and apply to any models of symmetry breaking .",
    "there is a less model - independent but powerful non - perturbative result called the weinberg sum rules  @xcite .",

    "in the case of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd , by using the charge - current algebra , weinberg has derived two sum rules .",

    "the simplest possibility is to promote the non - linear sigma model to a linear - sigma one by introducing a scalar field ( which is usually called the sigma meson ) .",

    "in view of such situation , the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) model  @xcite is proposed , in which the rho meson is introduced as a massive vector boson of a hidden local su(2 ) symmetry .    in susy breaking case , the low - energy effective lagrangian is formulated by volkov and akulov in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the nambu - goldstone fermion , the goldstino , is introduced as non - linearly transforming field under susy .",
    "the simplest possibility for the next lightest mode is the superpartner of the goldstino , formulating the low - energy effective model with a chiral supermultiplet .",
    "this is analogous to the linear sigma model realization of the chiral symmetry case . as in qcd",
    ", it is worth considering an alternative realization , namely the susy breaking model equivalent of the hls realization .",
    "such a realization is achieved by introducing the massive spin-2 field , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another realization of the massive higher spin states in susy gauge theories is related to the gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "for example , in the holographic qcd model @xcite , the hls naturally emerges and the rho meson appears as a `` kaluza - klein ( kk ) '' excitation mode of the five - dimensional gauge field in the holographic dual . in the context of the gauge / gravity duality ,",
    "the possibility of the dynamical susy breaking has been discussed  @xcite . if the gravity dual of the dynamical susy breaking model is successfully constructed , the goldstino should be identified with a normalizable zero mode of the kk modes of the bulk gravitino @xcite .",
    "furthermore , massive spin-3/2 and massive spin-2 modes also appear from gravitino and graviton in the dual supergravity . in this sense",
