    "their properties have been characterized by the concept of `` cluster emission '' @xcite .    the simple idea that hadrons are produced in clusters , rather than individually ,",
    "has had great success in describing many features of particle production @xcite . in this scenario , hadronization proceeds via `` clusters '' , high mass states ( e.g. resonances but not necessarily with all well - defined quantum numbers ) which decay isotropically in their rest frame into the final - state hadrons . an independent cluster emission model ( icm )",
    "has been widely applied to the study of two - particle correlations @xcite , where clusters are formed before the final - state hadrons and are independently emitted according to a dynamically generated distribution in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the clusters subsequently decay isotropically in their own rest frame into the observed final - state hadrons . the observed correlation strength and extent in phase space",
    "can be parameterized in terms of the cluster multiplicity , or `` size '' ( the average number of particles in a cluster ) and the decay `` width '' ( which characterizes the separation of the particles in pseudorapidity ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that independent cluster emission is only a phenomenological approach which provides no insight as to the mechanisms by which clusters are formed .",
    "further modeling is required to connect these studies to the underlying qcd dynamics .",

    "the phobos octagon detector , covering pseudorapidity -3 @xmath16 3 over almost the full azimuth , is well suited to measure the correlations between particles emitted from clusters .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2-d ) correlation functions in cu+cu and au+au collisions , as well as the extracted effective cluster size and width from one - dimensional ( 1-d ) @xmath17 correlation functions , are presented as a function of system size . by separating particle pairs into `` near - side '' ( @xmath18 ) and `` away - side '' ( @xmath19 ) , more detailed information on the properties of the clusters",

    "the data presented here for cu+cu and au+au collisions at @xmath20 200  gev were collected during rhic run 4 ( 2004 ) and run 5 ( 2005 ) using the large - acceptance phobos octagon silicon array covering pseudorapidity @xmath21 over almost the full azimuth .",
    "a full description of the phobos detector can be found in ref .",
    "the primary event trigger used the time difference between signals in two sets of 10 cerenkov counters located at 4.4 @xmath22 4.9 , to select collisions that were close to the nominal vertex position @xmath23 along the beam - axis .",
    "about 4 million events each of cu+cu and au+au collisions at @xmath13 = 200  gev were selected for further analysis by requiring that the primary collision vertex falls within @xmath24 6  cm .",
    "the angular coordinates ( @xmath25 ) of charged particles are measured using the location of the energy deposited in the silicon pads of the octagon .",
    "the granularity of the octagon is determined by the sizes of the readout pads which are about @xmath26 ( @xmath27 0.2 radians ) in @xmath1 and range from 0.006 to 0.05 in @xmath0 .",
    "noise and background hits are rejected by placing a lower threshold on the deposited energy corrected for the path length through the silicon after hit merging , assuming that the charged particle originated from the primary vertex .",
    "depending on @xmath0 , merged hits with less than 50 - 60% of the energy loss expected for a minimum ionizing particle are rejected .",
    "more details of the hit reconstruction procedure can be found in ref .",
    "the detailed analysis procedure is described in ref .",
    "the inclusive two - particle correlation function in ( @xmath28 ) space is defined as follows :    @xmath29    the first line of eq .",

    "it is then weighted by a factor , @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the total number of hits in each event , while generator level tracks are used in mc ) , and averaged over all the events .",
    "the event multiplicity normalization factor , @xmath31 , is introduced to compensate for the trivial dilution effects from uncorrelated particles since the number of uncorrelated pairs grows quadratically with @xmath32 , while the number of correlated pairs grows only linearly .",
    "therefore , @xmath33 is defined in such a way that if a heavy ion collision is simply a superposition of individual p+p collisions , the same correlation function will be observed in both a+a and p+p collisions .    the mixed - event background distribution @xmath34 ( also normalized to unit integral )",
    "is constructed by randomly selecting two particles from two different events with similar vertex ( with a bin width of 0.2  cm ) and centrality ( in bins of 5% of the total inelastic cross section ) , representing a product of two single particle distributions . since the background is found to be roughly multiplicity independent within a centrality bin , the inclusive @xmath34 is used in our calculations of eq .",
    "[ 2pcorr_incl ] for each centrality class .",
    "thus it can be either inside or outside the event average as shown in the two lines of eq .",

    "corrections for secondary effects and incomplete acceptance have been applied in a similar way to those in p+p collisions resulting in corrections with comparable magnitudes  @xcite .",
    "since the phobos octagon is a single - layer silicon detector , there is no @xmath36 , charge or mass information available for the particles .",
    "all charged particles above a low-@xmath36 cutoff of about 7  mev / c at @xmath0=3 , and 35  mev / c at @xmath0=0 ( which is the threshold below which a charged particle is stopped by the beryllium beam pipe ) are included on equal footing .",
    "thus secondary effects , such as @xmath37-electrons , @xmath38 conversions and weak decays , can not be all rejected directly .",
    "the incomplete azimuthal acceptance in some pseudorapidity regions naturally suppresses the overall correlation strength , but mc simulations show that it does not change the shape of the correlation function @xmath39 . to correct for these detector effects in the data ,",
    "correlation functions are calculated for mc events ( pythia for p+p collisions and hijing for a+a collisions ) at @xmath10 = 200  gev both at the generator level for true primary charged hadrons , @xmath40 , and with the full geant detector simulation and reconstruction procedure , @xmath41 .",
    "the whole correction procedure can be summarized by the following equation :    @xmath42.\\ ] ]    where the function ,    @xmath43    represents the correction for secondary effects which mainly contribute to a large , narrow spike in @xmath39 around @xmath2=0 , @xmath3=0 ( for more details , see ref .",
    "the acceptance correction factor , @xmath44 , is estimated to be around 1.3 with little dependence on vertex and centrality .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty for these corrections is typically about 5% of the final value of @xmath33 .",
    "in addition to these corrections , the high occupancies measured in a+a collisions ( which are in the range from 50 - 60% at midrapidity for the most central 3% of 200  gev au+au collisions ) require us to account for the high probability of multiple particles hitting a single pad .",
    "the @xmath45 distribution of hits in a very low multiplicity environment ( e.g. 55 - 60% peripheral cu+cu which has an occupancy of about 4% at midrapidity ) has been measured first in a narrow @xmath0 bin of 0.3 unit ( same bin size as for @xmath33 ) , to approximate the @xmath45 distribution for a single particle hitting a single silicon pad , @xmath46 . by convoluting @xmath46 @xmath47 times , the @xmath45 distribution of @xmath47 particles hitting a single pad can be predicted , @xmath48 ( i=1 , 2 , 3 .... ) .",
    "then , the @xmath45 distribution in more central data events , @xmath49 , is fitted by a sum of @xmath48 with weighting factor @xmath50 such that the relative contribution of different number of particles hitting on a single pad can be estimated , as illustrated in fig .",

    "<S> we present results on two - particle angular correlations in cu+cu and au+au collisions at a center of mass energy per nucleon pair of 200  gev over a broad range of pseudorapidity ( @xmath0 ) and azimuthal angle ( @xmath1 ) as a function of collision centrality . </S>",
    "<S> the phobos detector at rhic has a uniquely - large angular coverage for inclusive charged particles , which allows for the study of correlations on both long- and short - range scales . </S>",
    "<S> a complex two - dimensional correlation structure in @xmath2 and @xmath3 emerges , which is interpreted in the context of a cluster model . the effective cluster size and decay width </S>",
    "<S> are extracted from the two - particle pseudorapidity correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> the effective cluster size found in semi - central cu+cu and au+au collisions is comparable to that found in proton - proton collisions but a non - trivial decrease of the size with increasing centrality is observed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a comparison between results from cu+cu and au+au collisions shows an interesting scaling of the effective cluster size with the measured fraction of total cross section ( which is related to the ratio of the impact parameter to the nuclear radius , @xmath4 ) , suggesting a geometric origin . </S>",
    "<S> further analysis for pairs from restricted azimuthal regions shows that the effective cluster size at @xmath5 drops more rapidly toward central collisions than the size at @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of limited @xmath0 acceptance on the cluster parameters is also addressed , and a correction is applied to present cluster parameters for full @xmath0 coverage , leading to much larger effective cluster sizes and widths than previously noted in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> these results should provide insight into the hot and dense medium created in heavy ion collisions .    </S>",
