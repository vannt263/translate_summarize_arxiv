    "[ fig : toy_rel ] , we illustrate the extraction of @xmath179 from @xmath167 and @xmath182 by means of the first relation in ( [ extractphiw ] ) .",
    "finally , combining all the observables , i.e.  @xmath39 , @xmath176 and @xmath145 with their cp conjugates , improves the sensitivity to @xmath183 , as illustrated in the left panel of fig .",

    "[ fig : toy_angle][fig : toy_cpobs ] , the precision on the measurement of @xmath179 is expected to increase to about @xmath184 using 18k(130k ) @xmath30 events , which could finally be collected by the current ( upgraded ) lhcb experiment , assuming unchanged trigger and tagging performance .",
    "the sensitivity quoted here is different , but compatible with the projected sensitivity quoted by the lhcb collaboration  @xcite , where more sophisticated estimates are made for the trigger performance in the coming running periods .",
    "the different experimental errors for the determination of @xmath1 , @xmath47 and @xmath67 from the @xmath185 decays are collected in table  [ tab : toy2 ] .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath186 can be further constrained through the @xmath10 flavour symmetry , i.e.through ( [ xs - br - det ] ) or by means of ( [ eq : xsxd ] ) with ( [ eq : xdsquared ] ) .",
    "however , we find that this input , which would introduce the @xmath10 flavour symmetry into a theoretically clean strategy , does not significantly improve the precision for @xmath179 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if also decays of the type @xmath187 can be reconstructed , the precision could be further enhanced in a theoretically clean way .",
    "these channels require the reconstruction of a radiative photon in the decay @xmath188 and as such are experimentally more challenging . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a gain in statistics of 28% is deemed possible , leading to an improvement of 13% on the determination of @xmath189 .",
    "the decays @xmath0 offer an interesting playground for the lhcb experiment in this decade .",
    "we have performed a detailed analysis of the observables of these channels , addressing in particular the impact of the sizable @xmath6 decay width difference @xmath7 , which has recently been established .",
    "this quantity leads to a subtle difference between the experimental and theoretical branching ratios of the @xmath0 decays , which can be resolved experimentally through time information on the corresponding untagged data samples , such as measurements of the effective decay lifetimes .",
    "we derived a lower bound for the ratio of the experimental @xmath8 and @xmath63 branching ratios given in ( [ lhcb - cdf - br ] ) , and observe that the central value for the lhcb result is too small by about two standard deviations .",
    "the width difference @xmath7 offers the untagged observables @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the final states @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively , which can nicely be combined with the corresponding mixing - induced cp asymmetries @xmath146 and @xmath174 to determine @xmath1 in an unambiguous way .",
    "we have illustrated this strategy and have obtained predictions for the @xmath0 observables from an @xmath10 analysis of the @xmath11-factory data for @xmath12 , @xmath192 decays .",
    "moreover , making experimental simulations , we have shown that the interplay between the untagged observables @xmath39 , @xmath40 and the tagged cp asymmetries @xmath146 , @xmath174 is actually the key feature for being able to measure @xmath1 through the @xmath0 decays at lhcb . in this sense ,",
