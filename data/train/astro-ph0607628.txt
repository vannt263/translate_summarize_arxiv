    "after the cmb photons decoupled at redshift about @xmath0 , the intergalactic medium ( igm ) remained neutral until the first generation of luminous sources produced ionizing photons .",
    "recent measurements of the spectra of high redshift quasars in the sloan digital sky survey ( @xcite ) and of polarization anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) _ ( @xcite ) indicate that the igm was reionized during redshifts @xmath1 .",
    "the history of cosmic reionization contains abundant information about the formation of the first cosmic structures , and can be probed in various future observations , such as redshifted 21 cm signatures ( @xcite ) , the kinetic sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich effect ( @xcite ) , improved measurements of the large  angle cmb polarization fluctuations ( @xcite ) , the thermal state of the intergalactic medium ( @xcite ) , and lyman @xmath2 galaxy populations ( @xcite ) .",
    "being directly related to many observables , the distribution of the hi / hii regions during reionization has been studied extensively using both semi - analytic models and hydrodynamic simulations ( see , e.g. , the recent review by choudhury & ferrara ( 2006 ) , and references therein ) .",
    "if the spectrum of the first ionizing sources is soft ( such as a normal stellar spectrum ) , then the distribution of the ionized regions can be described by discrete hii bubbles around high density regions ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the source spectrum is hard and extends to x  ray energies ( such as for miniquasars ) , the photons can more readily escape into the igm , and may ionize the low  density regions first ( @xcite ) .",
    "the reionization topology in the above two limiting cases are often referred to as `` inside  out '' and `` outside  in '' respectively .",
    "we will adopt this distinctive terminology here , and we will use it to describe the ionization topology on arbitrarily large scales .",
    "existing analytic / semi - analytic models have generally described either one or the other of these two limiting scenarios ( i.e. by following the filling factor of ionized bubbles , or by assuming a uniformly rising ionizing background ) .",
    "the previous methods used to implement such models can not be easily generalized to derive statistics of the ionization topology , as a continuous function of the hardness of the source spectra . _",
    "the goal of the present paper is to construct a model of inhomogeneous reionization in which we can quantify properties of the ionization topology for sources with different spectral hardness and clustering properties .",
    "the hope is to derive from first principles , rather than assume , the large scale ionization topology and statistics . _",
    "more generally , the nature  the spectrum , spatial clustering , and evolution  of the ionizing source population is poorly known at present , and future observations ( as mentioned above ) promise to shed much light on these quantities .",
    "parameterized models , such as the one presented here , will be useful for interpreting these future observations .    in principle ,",
    "hydrodynamic simulations offer an alternative and more reliable way of studying the topology of reionization .",
    "however , it is difficult for the state - of - art simulations to cover large scales ( @xmath3mpc ) while resolving the sources and the gas distribution on small scales .",
    "recently , several groups have attempted to study the large scale properties of reionization using large scale simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "kohler et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for instance adopt a hybrid approach which combines small scale and large scale simulations . as will become clear below",
    ", our analytic treatment is in some sense similar : we use linear perturbation theory to address large scale questions while taking into account the effects of small scale clumping in the background evolution . even if in the future simulations that simultaneously resolve the necessary small scale structure and span over large scales were to become available",
    ", we would still need an analytic framework to better understand the physics of reionization .",
    "furthermore , the ionizing sources have to be inserted into the simulations , and their properties specified , essentially by hand . in practice , it is likely that the intepretation of future data on the ionization topology will require an exploration of various parameters of the sources that can not be computed ab ",
    "this , in turn , will require a semi  analytic , computationally less expensive model .    in a hierarchical universe such as our own ,",
    "one expects linear perturbation theory to work on sufficiently large scales .",
    "the spatial fluctuations in the ionized / neutral hydrogen and in the ionizing radiation can be related to the dark matter distribution via bias factors which are scale dependent in general . for a given source distribution ,",
    "these bias factors are determined by the radiative transfer equations and the equation of the photo - ionization balance .",
    "the approach followed in this paper is to solve the linearized versions of these equations in fourier space .",
    "given the source distributions and spectra , this approach allows us to calculate the linear biases of the ionized / neutral hydrogen and of the ionizing radiation , and to follow their evolution .",
    "the price paid is that our predictions for the spatial fluctuations are invalid on small scales .",
    "our calculation takes into account all of the relevant physical processes , including photo - ionization , recombination , the diffusion of photons , the peculiar velocity of the baryons , and the redshifting of photons due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "it is worth noting that in the existing semi - analytic models , typically only photo - ionization and recombination are treated in an exact manner .",
    "most of the other processes are either missing or treated approximately .",
    "our formalism accounts for all the relevant processes ( albeit in a perturbative manner ) and allows a comprehensive study of the dynamical evolution of the hi / hii regions and the radiation field with a general source spectra .",
    "it is our hope that the approach taken here can be developed further in future work , and will ultimately make it possible to constrain the high redshift source properties using future 21 cm and cmb observations .",
    "our approach is also useful for addressing the question of what robust cosmological information one can obtain from future 21 cm and cmb observations ( for instance , to what extent are the various linear biases scale independent ) .",

    "[ discussion ] below .    to illustrate the results , we choose three types of source spectra : @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "we show the evolution of the spatially averaged ionization fraction @xmath53 in fig .",
    "[ fefig ] , the hii bias ( @xmath158 ) at @xmath159 in fig .",
    "[ dfefig ] , and the hii bias as a function of the scale @xmath106 at redshift @xmath160 in fig .",
    "[ dfe_kfig ] . from fig .",
    "[ dfefig ] , we see that in the case of a soft source spectrum ( @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) , the bias of the hii regions remains at a high value during most time of reionization , and quickly drops to one when the hii regions percolate the igm .",
    "this can be understood in the usual bubble picture , in which the hii regions are confined within the hii bubbles due to the short mean free path of the photons .",
    "therefore , the hii regions do not merge on large scales until the mean ionization fraction of the igm reaches a very high level .",
    "in contrast , for a harder source spectrum , the bias of the hii regions decreases in a more continuous fashion .",
    "interestingly , this is not only because hard photons have a much longer mean free path , but also due to the fact that secondary ionizations are more intense in less ionized regions .",
    "the hii bias is intimately related to the issue of inside - out versus outside - in ionization .",
    "a reasonable definition of inside - out ionization is that @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the fluctuation in the ionized fraction .",
    "a positive correlation means higher density regions exhibit a higher ionized fraction .",
    "conversely , a negative correlation can be taken as the definition of outside - in ionization . to the lowest order , @xmath163",
    "therefore , the sign of @xmath164 is determined by whether the hii bias is greater or less than unity .",
    "it is worth noting that whether reionization is inside - out or outside - in can be a scale dependent question : the sign of @xmath165 could depend on the scale of interest ( think of @xmath57 and @xmath162 as quantities smoothed on some scale , or think of their fourier counterparts ) .    an important feature we learn from fig . [ dfefig ]",
    "is that the large scale bias of the hii regions is larger than unity in all three cases , which therefore means the high density regions tend to be more ionized than the low density regions .",
    "this fact shows that at least on large scales , the topology of the hii regions is inside - out , even for a hard source spectrum .",
    "this seems to hold on all scales that we have examined ( see fig .",
    "[ dfe_kfig ] ) , although one must note that our perturbative approach is expected to break down on sufficiently small scales .    by choosing @xmath166 ( @xmath167ev )",
    ", we find that eq.[[homofe_approx ] ] and eq.[[flinearfe2 ] ] are good approximations for @xmath53 and @xmath168 on large scales ( @xmath169 ) during most of the reionization process for the @xmath148 and @xmath149 cases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fefig ] and fig .",
    "[ dfefig ] .",
    "the reason for choosing this value of @xmath94 is not only that it provides a good fit for both @xmath53 and @xmath168 , but also because @xmath170 corresponds to a critical energy threshold , below which photons are significantly absorbed by neutral hydrogen , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fgama_mu ] is in logarithmic scale .",
    "we do not show labels on the y - axis because they are not important for our purpose . ] .",
    "in other words , eq . [ [ smallmu ] ] works well for photons with energies below @xmath170 during the early stages of reionization . for smaller scales , the agreement becomes worse because the photon propagation suppresses the small scale fluctuations , thus reducing the amplitude of the ( hii to dark matter / baryon ) bias .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ dfe_kfig ] .",
    "a useful way to see why the bias of hii decays faster for a harder source spectrum is to calculate the mean free path of the ionizing photons . for a specific frequency parameter @xmath20 ,",
    "the comoving mean free path is simply @xmath171 $ ] .",
    "the average mean free path can be defined as : @xmath172^{-1}\\ ] ] using eq.[[smallmu ] ] for three different source spectral indices , we find : @xmath173 these numbers basically answer the question of why in fig .",
    "[ dfefig ] the hii bias in the @xmath148 or @xmath149 case does not drop until the ionization fraction is very close to one .",
    "this is because in both cases the wave length of @xmath159 is larger than the average photon mean free path during most time of reionization .",
    "radiative transfer is unable to suppress perturbations on scales larger than the mean free path , and the hii bias more or less tracks the source bias .",
    "in contrast , hii perturbations on smaller scales are more easily suppressed by the radiation , which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ dfe_kfig ] as the suppression in @xmath174 for @xmath175 .",
    "however , we caution that our linear theory becomes inaccurate on small scales .",
    "we also find that other ways of estimating the average photon mean free path only change the results by a factor of a few , meaning that eq.[[meanfreepath ] ] provides a robust order of magnitude estimate .",
    "for example , if secondary ionization is included in eq.[[meanfreepath ] ] , the average mean free path in all thre cases is increased by no more than a factor of two .    in fig .",
    "[ dhifig ] , we show the redshift dependence of the fluctuation of the neutral fraction with respect to the dark matter ( @xmath176 ) at @xmath159 , which is proportional to the 21 cm signal from the neutral hydrogen ( see @xcite ) . at the early epoch of reionization",
    ", this quantity is close to unity since most of the igm is still neutral .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior at lower redshifts may suggest a best window for detecting the 21 cm emission .",
    "such a feature is more pronounced when the source spectrum is soft .",
    "the bias of the radiation monopole ( @xmath177 , which is simply called @xmath178 in the figures ) on scales of @xmath159 and @xmath179 is shown in fig .",
    "[ dfgama_mu ] as a function of the photon energy for different redshifts , and in fig .",
    "[ dfgama_time ] as a function of redshift for different photon energies .",
    "again , one can see a clear difference between the soft and the hard photons , which are divided by the critical line at @xmath167ev .",
    "the bias of the soft photons remains high until the hii percolation , following closely the bias of hii itself , at least during the early stages of reionization . on the other hand ,",
    "the high energy photons diffuse relatively freely into the space , leading to an ever decreasing bias .",
    "an interesting feature in fig .",
    "[ dfgama_time ] deserves a brief discussion : the bias of the radiation field ( especially for soft photons ) shoots up quickly right before percolation . in fig .",
    "[ dfefig ] , we notice that for a soft source spectrum , the bias of hii also rises before the time of percolation ( but less dramatically ) .",
    "this appears counter - intuitive : naively , one expects that both the hii abundance and the radiation roughly trace the ionizing sources , whose bias in our version of the extended press - schechter model always decays with time ( shown in fig .",
    "[ bias_source ] ) .",
    "while this intuition is correct in the early stages of reionization , the situation starts to change when the mean ionization fraction becomes significant .",
    "this is because a high density region generates more photons than it can consume ( by ionization when the ionized fraction is already high ) , and this leads to run - away , causing the abrupt rise of the bias of the radiation field ( with a corresponding , but less dramatic , rise of the hii bias ) .",
    "after percolation , the radiation bias of course drops precipitously because the photons are free to diffuse to large distances .",
    "this effect is less pronounced for hard photons because percolation for hard photons is a more gradual process to begin with .",
    "another interesting feature in fig .",
    "[ dfgama_time ] is that the bias of the soft photons exhibits damped oscillations after reionization is complete .",
    "this behavior can be traced back to the oscillatory kernel eq.[[angleavefgama ] ] . in the case of @xmath180 , the bias of the soft photons",
    "right before the percolation of hii bubbles rises up to a high value , meaning that high density regions contain many more photons than low density regions .",
    "such a difference between the high and the low density regions quickly decays away when the hii bubbles merge , when the soft photons are `` released '' and can freely travel to the neighbouring low density regions .",
    "the relaxation of this process leads directly to the oscillations we see in fig .",
    "[ dfgama_time ] .",
    "the oscillations are most pronounced when the wavelength is small ( high @xmath106 ) and when the post - percolation drop in bias is most abrupt ( i.e. when the photons are soft ) .",
    "note that these oscillations can be washed out by the stochastic bias of the ionizing sources , which is not considered in this paper .    finally , we find that the biases of both hii / hi and the radiation field remain scale invariant on large scales ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "this is not only because the source bias is scale invariant in our model , but also due to the fact that the diffusion of photons is negligible when the scale of interest is much larger than the mean free path .",
    "using eq.[[angleavefgama ] ] again , we can see that at small @xmath106 the oscillatory kernel remains constant , therefore the @xmath106 dependence is essentially removed .",
    "the scale invariant nature of the large scale hii / hi bias can be very useful , because it makes it possible to measure the shape of the primordial mass power spectrum using the hi power spectrum .",
    "the evolution of the hi fluctuation shown in fig .",
    "[ dhifig ] may be useful for this purpose in future 21 cm observations .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss several interesting issues related to our results above .",
    "first , recall that the clumping factors @xmath182 and @xmath72 are set by hand in our calculations . in particular",
    ", we have neglected their dependence on redshift and frequency ( the latter is relevant for @xmath182 ) .",
    "the precise dependence is uncertain , and is only partially addressed by the most recent simulations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , as emphasized before , the clumping factors appear explicitly only in the evolution equations for the spatially averaged quantities ( eq . [ [ homofe ] ] & [ [ homofgama ] ] ) , and not in the equations for the first order perturbations ( eq . [ [ flinearfe ] ] & [ [ flinearfgama ] ] ) . the clumping factors only influence the first order perturbations indirectly through their influence on the background quantities @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "while quantitative details regarding the perturbations do depend on the precise values of the clumping factors , the overall qualitative behavior , such as the evolution of the various biases , remain quite robust .",
    "another issue concerns the topology of the hii distribution .",
    "it is interesting to ask if the topology is still inside - out if the source spectrum is made up of only hard photons .",
    "this , for example , is relevant to the scenario proposed by ricotti & ostriker ( 2004 ) , in which reionization at high redshift is caused by highly obscured miniquasars . to answer this question",
    ", we consider three cases , in which we remove the soft photons by mutilating the @xmath151 spectrum and erasing all photons below @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , respectively ( the emissivity factor @xmath140 is raised to @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 , respectively to yield the same optical depth ) . in fig .",
    "[ fe_x_ray ] , we see that the bias of hii always exceeds unity , meaning the topology is not outside - in , but the hii bias does decrease with increasing hardness of the ionizing photons .",
    "one can also try to reduce the hii bias by lowering the source bias . in fig .",
    "[ fe_sourcebias_one ] , we repeat the calculation for the case of ( @xmath189 ) except that the source bias is artificially set to unity , which is probably the lowest value one can expect , in any scenario in which the ionizing sources populate collapsed halos .",
    "we find that the bias of hii is again always larger than one is due to the run - away effect introduced in  [ results ] . ] . for @xmath149 or",
    "@xmath151 , the evolution of the hii bias becomes more featureless and very close to unity at all redshifts and a source bias of unity , the hii bias right before the end of reionization does go slightly below unity .",
    "this means that the ionization topology is marginally outside - in . ] .",
    "therefore , our conclusion about the topology of the hii distribution is robust . )",
    "( see , , @xcite ) . whether or not the non - linear terms can affect the large scale ionization topology is still an open question ( although the arguments in appendix b suggest that the high order effects can be neglected on sufficiently large scales ) . ]    at the end of reionization , our conclusion about the ionization topology may seem counter - intuitive , especially for x - ray reionizations . assuming a homogeneous radiation background ( which is the limiting case for very hard spectra of the x - ray reionization scenarios considered here )",
    ", one finds that in the limit of a low neutral fraction , @xmath190 , ionization equilibrium implies @xmath191 , i.e. more overdense regions are less ionized .",
    "therefore , the ionization topology should be `` outside - in '' rather than inside - out , in the limit of late times and a very hard spectrum .",
    "our calculations above do not reveal this limiting case , however , for the following reasons : ( i ) our sources do not have arbitrarily hard spectra , ( ii ) we include a clustering of the ionizing sources , which , together with the rapid evolution of the emissivity , causes the background radiation to be persistently non  uniform .",
    "we have , however , checked that our code can reproduce the outside - in limiting case when we set the source bias to be zero ( i.e. at late times , our code yields the expected behavior @xmath192 , which follows from @xmath191 in the limit of a small mean neutral fraction @xmath193 and small fluctuations ) .",
    "we have made at least two important simplifications in our calculations .",
    "one is ignoring helium .",
    "the other is to assume the source bias is deterministic .",
    "it is in principle straightforward to relax these assumptions / restrictions .",
    "we hope to do so in a future paper .    in practice , we still know little about the source properties at redshift above six . this work can serve as a link between the high redshift sources and the large scale distributions of the hii regions and the radiation fields .",
    "for example , as we have shown , the bias of the source distributions is similar to that of the hii regions during the early period of reionization ; the evolution history of the bias of the hii regions can be used to constrain the hardness of the source spectrum .",
    "it allows us to constrain the source properties with the upcoming 21 cm observations and the kinetic sz effect from the cmb .",
    "furthermore , as we have found in our calculation that the distribution of hii traces the dark matter s on large scales with a scale independent bias , these observations may also be used to measure the shape of the linear matter power spectrum .",
    "a more careful discussion of these issues will appear in another paper .",
    "we have developed a perturbation theory of cosmic reionization by solving the linearized radiative transfer equation and the equation of ionization balance in fourier space .",
    "the formalism can be used to predict the large scale fluctuations of the hii regions and the radiation fields for a given spatial distribution and spectrum of the ionizing sources .",
    "the numerical solutions are straightforward to obtain . in the case of uv dominated source spectra ,",
    "we have found an approximate analytic solution which works accurately in the early stages of reionization .    to illustrate our formalism",
    ", we use the extended press - schechter theory to model the source clustering and adopt three different power - law type source spectra .",
    "we find that for uv dominated source spectra , the biases of the hii regions and the uv photons remain high during most of the reionization process . for hard source spectra ,",
    "the hii regions tend to be ionized in a more homogeneous manner .",
    "the hii bias decays faster with time due to a longer photon mean free path and due to secondary ionization .",
    "the topology of the hii distribution is always inside - out , with overdense regions more highly ionized , at least on large scales .",
    "our findings suggest that clustering measurements from future 21 cm and cmb observations can be used to put constraints on properties ( both clustering and spectra ) of the ionizing sources .",
    "furthermore , on sufficiently large scales , both hii and hi have a scale independent bias with respect to dark matter  this means the same observations might be used to measure the shape of the matter power spectrum .    a direct comparison of our results with 3d simulations ( such as those by kohler et al .",
    "2005 , iliev et al .",
    "2005 , and zahn et al .",
    "2006 ) would be valuable and interesting .",
    "an accurate comparison requires detailed information on the source properties and the clumping factors from the simulations , and we hope to perform such a comparison in a future paper .",

    "in this appendix , we address the following question : is linear perturbation theory justified on large scales even when highly nonlinear structures exist on small scales ? this is a deep question that arises both in the present context of reionization and in the more familiar context of large scale structure formation theory .",
    "we will make no attempt to provide a rigorous justification here .",
    "intead , we will make some plausibility arguments , which are borrowed from the field of large scale structure ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "ultimately , numerical simulations are needed to rigorously justify the use of perturbation theory on large scales .",
    "setting the last term of eq.[[linearnonlinear ] ] to be zero , we have @xmath208_{\\rm linear } e^{i \\vec{k } \\cdot \\vec{x}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced a mask @xmath209 which vanishes in the nonlinear regions , and equals unity in the linear regions , and we have linearized the ionization and recombination terms .    ultimately , we are interested in the power spectrum of fluctuations in @xmath13 for instance .",
    "eq.([linear2 ] ) tells us that its evolution can be regarded as linear as long as we are studying scales @xmath106 on which the mask @xmath210 , or its fourier transform , has a negligible effect on the power spectrum .",
    "generally , the linear approximations will be valid only on scales much larger than the size of the nonlinear regions , and likely even larger than the clustering scale of the nonlinear regions .",
    "for instance , in the early stages of reionization , we expect perturbation theory to work only on scales that encompass many hii bubbles .",

    "most of the photons are consumed within the galaxy , but inevitably there will be some that escape .",
    "one usually quantifies this by the escape fraction . here , we can account for this effect by renormalizing the source : @xmath212 e^{i \\vec{k } \\cdot \\vec{x}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the mask @xmath210 is the same as before , and the sink term can be linearized .",
