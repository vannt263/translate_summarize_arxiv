    "the timing solution for the crab pulsar is built using the data collected from the nanay and jodrell radiotelescopes , that are involved in the lat pulsar timing campaign  @xcite .",
    "the crab ephemeris has been built with the tempo2  @xcite package , using a set of @xmath9 observations at @xmath10 and @xmath11 observations at @xmath12 , collected between august 2008 and april 2009  @xcite .",
    "for this analysis  @xcite we have considered a data sample covering the period from august 2 , 2008 to april 7 , 2009 . in particular , we have used only `` diffuse '' class  @xcite photon events , that ensure the most effective background rejection .",
    "events with zenith angles larger than @xmath13 have been excluded from the analysis , in order to avoid contaminations from the earth albedo gamma - rays .",

    "the two terms at the right hand side of eq .",

    "the crab nebula spectrum has been reconstructed without assuming any spectral model and without performing any fit .",
    "this analysis technique also allows to take into account the energy dispersion introduced by the detector response , that is not considered in the maximum likelihood approach .",
    "the observed count spectrum of the nebula , used as input for the unfolding analysis , is built selecting the photons in the off - pulse window , and subtracting the background counts , evaluated using the background model obtained from the `` gtlike '' fit .",

    "the observed count spectrum of the pulsar is built selecting photons in the on - pulse phase window , and subtracting the background counts in the off - pulse window , properly rescaled for the on / off phase ratio ( i.e. @xmath39 according to the definition in section  [ sec : evsel ] ) .",
    "as for the nebula , the unfolded spectrum of the pulsar is consistent with the one evaluated from the maximum likelihood analysis .",

    "the spectra reconstructed with these two analysis techniques are in good agreement , thus confirming the reliability of our measurement .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat has allowed a precise measurement of the spectra of both the crab pulsar and nebula that has been made possible by the wider energy range and by the better energy sensitivity with respect to its predecessors .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges support from a number of agencies and institutes for both development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
