    "the main aims of the sxds are to make an accurate measurement of the global properties of the universe without being affected by cosmic variance and to reveal the evolution of the large scale structure .",
    "the sxds consists of a wealth of multi - wavelength data taken by the most modern observing facilities ; x - ray imaging / spectroscopic data in the 0.210 kev band taken by the european photon imaging camera ( epic ; @xcite ) onboard _ xmm - newton _",

    "the overall survey design and details of each survey are summarized in @xcite .",
    "the data of _ xmm - newton _  constitute a major component of the sxds project .",
    "x - ray surveys are a powerful tool to trace the cosmological evolution of active phenomena in the universe , including active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and clusters / groups of galaxies . the main constituents of x - ray sources that make up the x - ray background ( xrb ) are agns ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "their dominant populations are `` obscured '' agns @xcite , where the central engine is blocked by dust and/or gas in the line of sight .",
    "in particular , surveys by hard x - rays above 2 kev are the most efficient approach to detect these obscured agn populations of various luminosity classes with least bias , thanks to their strong penetrating power against the photo - electric absorption of matter and small contamination from stars .",
    "in fact , the surface density of agns detected in the most sensitive x - ray surveys @xcite far exceeds that detected in the optical bands ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , thus providing us with the most complete and clean samples for agn studies including heavily obscured , low luminosity ones that dominate the whole agn populations by number .    the tight correlation between the mass of a super massive black hole ( smbh ) in the galactic center and that of the galactic bulge @xcite indicates strong links between the growth of smbhs and star formation in the past .",
    "since agns are phenomena that mark the process of growth of smbhs in galactic centers , to elucidate the evolution of agns is a fundamental issue for understanding the history of the universe .",
    "combination of ultra - deep pencil beam surveys and large area surveys have revealed the cosmological evolution of the x - ray luminosity function of agns @xcite .",
    "the global accretion history of the universe is similar to that of star formation ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an important finding is that the number density of more luminous agns have a peak at higher redshifts compared with less luminous ones .",
    "this behavior is called `` down - sizing '' or `` anti - hierarchical '' evolution , which is opposite to a naive expectation from the standard structure formation theory of the universe .",
    "similar trends were also obtained in the star formation history ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these facts imply two modes of `` co - evolution '' of galaxies and smbhs for different masses .",
    "it could be explained by the feedback from supernova and agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "deep multi - wavelength surveys enable us to observe various populations in different evolutionary stage , giving the best opportunities to investigate how galaxies and smbhs co - evolved with cosmic time .    despite this major progress on agn evolution in recent years",
    ", there are several critical issues to be resolved by current and future x - ray surveys , even if we limit the scope only to x - ray detected agns .",
    "immediate objectives include ( 1 ) whether or how the fraction of obscured agns evolves with redshift , ( 2 ) the number density of compton thick agns ( those whose line - of - sight absorption exceeds @xmath18 @xmath5 ) , ( 3 ) the evolution of the agn luminosity function at high redshifts ( @xmath19 ) to be compared with the results from optical qso surveys , and ( 4 ) the evolution of clustering properties of agns as a function of luminosity and type .",
    "the sxds x - ray survey , one of the few `` wide '' and `` deep '' surveys , will give important steps to answer these questions and to establish the average properties of the agn populations .",
    "population synthesis models of the xrb utilize the results from deep surveys in a limited area at the faintest flux levels @xcite , which would be subject to cosmic variance when we discuss the xrb spectrum with @xmath2010% accuracy .",
    "this is crucial when we discuss a relatively minor contribution of some x - ray sources , such as compton thick agns . to constrain the statistical properties of rare objects , such as high redshift qsos ,",
    "much larger cosmic volume is necessary than in the currently available deep surveys . by surveying a continuous area with a large depth , we can also study the evolution of the large scale structure probed by agns .",
    "it helps us to understand the physical conditions that triggers agn activity for different luminosity class , type ( 1 or 2 ) , and redshift . at the flux limits of the sxds",
    ", we can detect the most dominant populations of x - ray sources that contribute to the xrb . in all of these studies , high completeness of identification ( redshift determination ) is crucial .",
    "the multi - wavelength data are particularly useful in identifying x - ray sources even if optical spectroscopy is difficult for a population of `` optically faint '' agns @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the x - ray data of the sxds based on the _ xmm - newton_survey performed in 2000 and 2003 .",

    "we produce source lists separately from different pointings ( sds-1 through 7 ) .",
    "later , these are merged into one list by excluding overlapping regions to define a statistically independent sample from the whole data (   3.3 ) .",
    "the overall flow of the source detection is similar to the one adopted in the ssc pps used to produce the 2xmm catalog ( watson et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , although several improvements are employed here .",
    "the main differences are as follows ; ( 1 ) we perform source detection to the summed image of pn , mos1 , and mos2 , not to individual ones .",
    "( 2 ) we optimize several parameters of the spline interpolation in making background maps .",
    "( 3 ) special care is paid to separate neighboring sources .      for each observation , energy band , and detector ,",
    "we create a background map from the image by spline interpolation with the sas program _ esplinemap _  after excluding sources found with _",
    "eboxdetect _ , which perform simple source detection based on a cell detection algorithm .",
    "after optimization of parameters , we verify that the obtained models well represent the profiles of the background ( i.e. , the unresolved xrb plus non x - ray background ) over the whole fov without large deviation from the data .",
    "we sum up the pn , mos1 , mos2 images and background maps for each energy band and each `` pointing '' , which means also combining those of multiple observations for sds-1 , 3 and 4 .",
    "this enables us to achieve the best sensitivity from the whole available data in the simplest manner . at the same time",
    ", we can avoid technical problems in the position and flux determination that would be caused by image gaps between ccd chips in a single detector .    to obtain exposure maps",
    ", we first calculated them for each instrument in narrow energy bands of every 0.5 kev , using the sas task _",
    "eexpmap_. then , we took their count - rate weighted average , normalized to the pn count rate in a given survey band .",
    "the count rate distribution is calculated through the energy response of each instrument assuming a power law photon index of 1.5 above 2 kev and 2.0 below 2 kev .",
    "the dependence on assumed photon indices is negligibly small in the analysis .",
    "the cross - calibration of effective area between the pn and mos cameras is known to be accurate within 5% level , and its uncertainty does not affect the results .    with this procedure , we are able to treat the summed images and exposure maps as if they were created from a single pn detector regardless of the detected position . in the following analysis",
    ", we present the flux of a source in terms of a `` pn - equivalent '' count rate . strictly speaking",
    ", this treatment may not be perfectly accurate in the image fitting process described below , because the positions of the optical axis in the combined image are not common for different detectors and observations , which could affect a precise modeling of the combined point spread function ( psf ) of the mirrors . to estimate _",
    "systematic errors caused by this effect , we make the same analysis by changing the position of the optical axis to that of a mos camera .",
    "we find that the fluxes of sources obtained in the two analyses match each other by 1.3% level , confirming that this approximation is justified at this accuracy .",
    "figure  1 shows the pseudo three - colored x - ray image of the sxds field combined from the 7 pointings .",
    "this image is made by the _ export _ command in the iraf package .",
    "as the inputs , we use the exposure - corrected , background subtracted pn+mos1+mos2 images in the 0.52 , 24.5 , and 4.510 kev bands , corresponding to red , green , and blue colors , respectively .",
    "they are smoothed by a gaussian profile with a 1@xmath27 width of 4 arcsec over the entire field .",
    "larger color fluctuation is apparently seen in outer regions compared with the central region due to the shorter exposure .",
    "the source list from each pointing is obtained by the maximum likelihood fit applied to the detector co - added images in the four energy bands by using the sas task _",
    "emldetect_. the _ emldetect_program reads images , background maps , and exposure maps in a single or multiple energy bands , and makes a simultaneous fit to the images with a model consisting of psfs over the background map , based on the input list of source candidates .",
    "it returns the fitted position , vignetting - corrected count rate , and detection likelihood ( hereafter called `` ml '' standing for maximum likelihood ) of each source .",
    "the obtained count rate corresponds to the total flux in the entire psf .    to make the list complete ,",
    "this process is iterated twice in the following manner .",
    "we first perform cell detection by _ eboxdetect _  with a cell size of 20@xmath12@xmath28 20@xmath12  to obtain a list of source candidates with minimum likelihood of 3.2 , which is used as an input to the first run of _ emldetect_. in both programs we allow the flux and position of a source to be free parameters . we find that in some cases the above cell size is too large to completely detect sources in a high density region .",
    "to supplement this , we also perform cell - detection with a 12@xmath12@xmath28 12@xmath12cell size , and add new source candidates detected with high significance into the source list obtained above . in this stage , by human inspection , we pay attention not to include obviously fake sources such as a part of a psf tail from nearby bright sources , diffuse emission , and false detection close to gaps between ccd chips .",
    "the merged list is again input to _ emldetect _ , producing a final source list .    through the fitting process",
    ", we find that there are sources that are likely to be confused by the psf of neighboring ones in crowded regions . to measure the fluxes of these sources with the best accuracy , we perform an image fit in each region by allowing the positions and fluxes of the multiple sources ( up to three ) to vary simultaneously in order to solve the coupling of the fluxes self - consistently .",
    "their angular separation is typically 12@xmath12 24@xmath12 .",
    "their fluxes are replaced with the new values obtained here , and the ml values are calculated for each source at the fixed position .",
    "the number of pairs of such possibly confused sources are about 10 per pointing , and are marked by flag `` c '' in the last column of the source catalog ( table  2 ) .",
    "the statistic that _ emldetect _  uses to fit the source parameters is the @xmath29 statistic defined by @xcite . for a poissonian probability distribution , appropriate to the measurement of x - ray events by _ xmm - newton _",
    ", cash s statistic takes the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the expected number of x - ray events in the @xmath32th pixel and @xmath33th energy band , @xmath34 is the detected number of events in that pixel / band , and the sum is over the @xmath8 pixels within the detection region and the @xmath35 energy bands used ( here = 4 as stated ) .",
    "the value of @xmath31 is obtained by adding the value of the source model at that pixel / band to the expected contribution from the background ; @xmath31 is thus a function of the source model parameters .    after arriving at those values of the source parameters which minimize @xmath29 , the detection likelihood ( formally , the probability of the null hypothesis ) for those optimum values is then calculated .",
    "cash s prescription for this is to form the difference @xmath36 where @xmath37 is @xmath29 calculated by setting the amplitude of the source model to zero and @xmath38 is the minimum result returned by the fitting routine .",
    "according to cash s theory , @xmath39 is distributed approximately as @xmath40 for @xmath41 degrees of freedom , where @xmath41 is the number of fitted parameters .",
    "the probability @xmath42 of obtaining the calculated value of @xmath39 or greater by chance fluctuations of the detected background can therefore be obtained in terms of the complementary incomplete gamma function @xmath43 as follows : @xmath44 the value of ml is set within _",
    "emldetect _  to equal @xmath45 .",
    "note that the statistics must be treated with caution when the total number of photon counts used for the fit are very small ( @xmath46 9 ) , which is not the case in our analysis .",
    "the ml value as calculated in the above way is viewed as more sensitive than the simple box - detection statistic used by _",
    "eboxdetect _ , because it uses information about the source psf to help reject random fluctuations of the detected background .",
    "offsetting this is a possible bias introduced by the fact that _ emldetect _  is not given free rein over the whole field , but is applied only to a small number of restricted areas of the field , at locations of candidate sources already found by _",
    "eboxdetect_. if the detection threshold of _ eboxdetect _  is set to too high a value , there is a risk that a real source with a good shape , but not many counts , will be missed by the combined detection process . in order to avoid this bias ,",
    "one ought therefore to run the preceding _ eboxdetect _  with a detection threshold set deliberately low . on the other hand , since _ emldetect _  must go though the computationally - intensive fitting process with each of its candidates , it will be impractical to provide it with too long a list of candidates .",
    "the respective values of 3.2 and 7 adopted here for the _ eboxdetect _  and _ emldetect _  likelihood cutoffs were chosen with this necessary compromise in mind .    an additional advantage of using _ emldetect _",
    "to determine the final source parameters is its ability to add the models of already fitted sources to an internal background map .",
    "since the sources are processed in the order of their brightness , it is possible to take into account the background introduced by bright sources when fitting the fainter sources .      up to this stage",
    ", all sources are assumed to be point like . to constrain the spatial extent of the detected sources , we perform an image fit by allowing the source extent to be a free parameter assuming a gaussian profile .",
    "the source positions are fixed at the input ones .",
    "this procedure yields a list of extended source candidates from the sxds field ( table  3 ) . for these sources , the fluxes listed in table  2",
    "correspond to those obtained in this process with consideration of the source extent .",
    "however , as our procedure is essentially dedicated to detection of point like sources in the earlier stage , this list must be regarded to be incomplete . a more extensive approach to search for extended sources",
    "will be presented elsewhere ( finoguenov et al .",

    "we keep all sources whose summed ml from the four bands is equal to or exceeds 5 , which will be further screened in the following way .    to make scientific research in comparison with previous studies , it is quite useful to define a sample selected in standard bands such as 0.54.5 kev ( hereafter `` xid band '' ) and 210 kev band ( `` hard band '' ) .",
    "although the combined flux and ml can be calculated from those in the two individual bands ( i.e. , 0.52 and 24.5 kev for the xid band , and 24.5 and 4.510 kev for the hard band ) , its statistical treatment would become quite complex ; for instance , the sensitivity limit can not be uniquely determined as a function of ml at a given position , depending on the source spectrum .",
    "hence , to obtain a well defined sample selected in the xid or hard band in the same way as in the four narrow bands , we calculate their ml values by repeating the likelihood fit using the 0.54.5 or 210 kev image with the background map summed from the two narrow bands . in the fit ,",
