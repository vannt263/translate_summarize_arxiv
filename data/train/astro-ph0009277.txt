    "the detection of the large - angle temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the _ cobe _",
    "dmr experiment  @xcite provided important evidence of large - scale spacetime inhomogenities .",
    "since then , many cmb measurements have reported detections or upper limits of the cmb anisotropy power spectrum over a wide range of scales  @xcite .",
    "recently , boomerang  @xcite and maxima  @xcite data have revealed the structure of the first doppler peak which arises from acoustic oscillations of the baryon - photon plasma on the last scattering surface . future ground - based and balloon - borne experiments , and upcoming nasa map satellite will unveil detailed features of the cmb anisotropy , thus allowing one to determine to a high precision a number of cosmological parameters  @xcite .",
    "the cmb is linearly polarized when the anisotropic radiation is scattered with free electrons near the last scattering surface  @xcite .",
    "the degree of polarization is about one - tenth of the temperature anisotropy at sub - degree scales  @xcite .",
    "the cmb polarization contains a wealth of information about the early universe as well .",
    "it provides a sensitive test of the reionization history as well as the presence of non - scalar metric perturbations , and improves the accuracy in determining the cosmological parameters  @xcite .",
    "so far , the current upper limit on the cmb linear polarization is @xmath0  @xcite . a handful of new experiments , adopting low - noise receivers as well as long integration time per pixel , are underway or being planned  @xcite .",
    "cmb experiments are commonly single - dish chopping instruments , whose scanning strategy and data analysis procedure are well developed . in the last decade , interferometers were introduced to study the microwave sky .",
    "recent advancement in low - noise , broadband , ghz amplifiers , in addition to mature synthesis imaging techniques , has made interferometry a particularly attractive technique for detecting cmb anisotropies .",
    "an interferometric array is intrinsically a high - resolution instrument well - suited for observing small - scale intensity fluctuations , while being flexible in coverage of a wide range of angular scales with the resolution and sensitivity determined by the aperture of each element of the array and the baselines formed by the array elements .",
    "a desirable feature of the interferometer for cmb observation is that it directly measures the power spectrum of the sky .",
    "in addition , many systematic problems that are inherent in single - dish experiments , such as ground and near field atmospheric pickup , and spurious polarization signal , can be reduced or avoided in interferometry .",
    "a brief account of the interferometic cmb observations can be found in ref .",
    "currently , several new interferometers including the very small array ( vsa )  @xcite , degree angular scale interferometer ( dasi )  @xcite , cosmic background imager ( cbi )  @xcite , array for microwave background anisotropy ( amiba )  @xcite are being built , with sensitivity about a few @xmath1 per beam .",
    "as for the polarization capability , the amiba will have full polarizations , whereas the vsa , dasi , and cbi will not be polarization sensitive initially .",
    "the output of an interferometer is the visibility that is the fourier transform of the intensity fluctuations on the sky . in this paper",
    ", we will study the cmb anisotropies in the visibility space .",
    "there are several papers dealing with cmb anisotropy data from interferometers  @xcite , and making explicit contact of the visibility with the angular power spectrum in @xmath2-space that is frequently used in single - dish experiments  @xcite .",
    "all of them have treated the cmb sky as flat due to the fact that typically a small field on the sky is viewed by the interferometer .",
    "this turns the analysis into a familiar two - dimensional fourier transform problem . here rather than assuming the flat - sky approximation , we will perform a full - sky analysis of the visibility .",
    "although we then have to give up the relatively simple fourier - transform formalism , the bonus is that the angular power spectrum can be directly transferred to the visibility space .",
    "hence , the statistics of the cmb visibilities is straightforward induced by the gaussian variables in @xmath2-space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ cmb ] , a brief account of the building block of cmb anisotropies is given .",

    "[ int ] , and present the calculations of the cmb visibilities in sec .",

    "[ noise ] , and the cmb polarization is treated in sec .",
    "estimation of signal to noise ratios for interferometric cmb measurements are made in sec .",
    "[ con ] is our conclusions and discussions .",
    "before we study the interferometric observation of cmb anisotropies , let us review the basic ingredients that are based upon the multipole expansion of the gaussian random fields and commonly used in analyzing single - dish experiments    polarized emission is conventionally described in terms of the four stokes parameters @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the intensity , @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the linear polarization , and @xmath7 describes the circular polarization . since circular polarization can not be generated by thomson scattering alone , the parameter @xmath7 decouples from the other components and will not be considered .",
    "let us define @xmath8 be the temperature fluctuation about the mean , then the cmb anisotropies are completely described by @xmath9 , where each parameter is a function of the pointing direction @xmath10 on the celestial sphere .",
    "considering the cmb as gaussian random fields , we can expand the stokes parameters as  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are gaussian random variables , and @xmath14 are spin-2 spherical harmonics .",
    "details of the spin - weighted spherical harmonics and their properties can be found in appendix  a.    isotropy in the mean guarantees the following ensemble averages : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are respectively the anisotropy , e - polarization , b - polarization , and t - e cross correlation angular power spectra .",

    "the details about the evaluation of the power spectra can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in realistic cmb observations , due to the finite beam size of the antenna and the beam switching mechanism ,",
    "a measurement is actually a convolution of the antenna response and the stokes parameters .",
    "this can be accounted by a mapping of the spherical harmonics in eq .",
    "( [ expand ] ) , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the window function .",
    "for a simple single - dish experiment with gaussian beamwidth @xmath28 , it was found that  @xcite @xmath29 . \\label{swinf}\\ ] ]",
    "in contrast to single - dish experiments that measure or differentiate the signals in individual dishes , an interferometer measures correlation of the signals from different pairs of the array elements .",
    "let us consider a two - element instrument and a monochromatic electromagnetic source .",
    "the output , called the _",
    "complex visbility _ , of the interferometer is the time - averaged correlation of the electric field @xmath30 measured by two antennae pointing in the same direction to the sky but at two different locations  @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the separation vector ( baseline ) of the two antennae measured in units of the observation wavelength , @xmath33 denotes the primary beam with the phase tracking center pointing along the unit vector @xmath34 , and @xmath4 is the intensity of the source .",
    "note that @xmath32 is generally a three - dimensional vector , and that @xmath35 since @xmath33 and @xmath4 are real functions .    in the following , we consider a primary antenna with gaussian beamwidth @xmath28 given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the polar angles with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "antenna theory  @xcite states that @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the observation wavelength , @xmath40 is the field of view , and the effective area is the aperature efficiency times the physical area of the antenna : @xmath41 let us assume a circular dish with diameter @xmath42 , then we have @xmath43    in typical interferometric measurements , we have @xmath44 , dictating a small @xmath40 .",
    "thus , for a single pointing , it is very good to make the flat - sky approximation by decomposing @xmath45 meaning that @xmath46 is a two - dimensional vector lying in the plane of the sky .",
    "hence , the complex visibilty is reduced to the two - dimensional fourier transform of the sky intensity multiplied by the primary beam : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the two - dimensional projection vector of @xmath32 in the @xmath46-plane .    in a single - dish experiment ,",
    "the resolution of the image is limited by the finite primary beamwidth .",
    "in contrast , the interferometric imaging has resolution of the synthesized beamwidth which is determined by the sampling of the visibility plane ( @xmath48-plane ) , where the minimum spacing is the physical size of the dish while the maximum spacing is limited by the size of the platform which resides the dishes .",
    "the sampling can be described by a sampling function @xmath49 , which is zero where no data have been taken .",
    "one can then perform the inverse fourier transform to form the so - called dirty image , @xmath50 using the convolution theorem , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the synthesized beam that is the fourier transform of @xmath49 .",
    "so , in the flat - sky approximation the calculation is simplified into a two - dimensional fourier transform problem . however , the cmb is a large source .",
    "although it is valid to treat the sky as flat due to the small field of view of the primary beam in a single pointing , a larger scale cmb image requires multiple pointings on the sky .",
    "in addition , after replacing locally the sphere by a plane , the global property of the cmb field is obscured although there is a direct link between the angular power spectrum and the power spectrum in the plane .",
    "therefore , in the following we will begin with the general form for the complex visibility in eq .",
    "( [ fullv ] ) .",
    "the cmb brightness fluctuation is related to the temperature fluctuation by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the planck function of the photon frequency @xmath55 , and @xmath56 we write @xmath57 and then do the anisotropy angular power spectrum expansion  ( [ expand ] ) .",
    "let us concentrate on the power spectrum and neglect the effect of the primary beam by taking for now the infinite resolution limit that @xmath58 , then from eq .",
    "( [ fullv ] ) the complex visibilty of the cmb anisotropy is written as @xmath59 also expanding the phase factor in terms of spherical waves , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the spherical bessel junction and @xmath62 , we obtain @xmath63 for a fixed length of the baseline , eq .",
    "( [ vtl ] ) is analogous to a measurement of the temperature anisotropy @xmath64 in real space with a window function .",
    "so , the statistics of @xmath65 on a sphere of radius @xmath66 in the visibility space is completely described by the @xmath12 and the positively definite function @xmath67 we will call this function the _ interference function_. estimation of the @xmath16 s can be made from the visibility data in the same way as one does for an anisotropy sky map , with the sample variances determined by the coverage of the visibility sphere .    using eq .",
    "( [ cmbaa ] ) , the two - point correlation function is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the legendre polynomial and @xmath70 .",
    "hence , the rms temperature anisotropy in a given visibility is @xmath71 on the other hand , based on the flat - sky approximation , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite have obtained a similar autocorrelation function but with a different interference function , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the bessel function . a comparison between these two interference functions is made in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with @xmath74 .",
    "both interference functions have a high peak at @xmath75 and drop rapidly as @xmath76 . while @xmath77 is positively definite , @xmath78 is oscillatory about the zero and has a lower peak .",
    "as such the latter would underestimate the rms fluctuation in a given visibility .",
    "for instance , assuming a flat anisotropy power spectrum , we find that the flat - sky rms visibility is about one - fourth of that in eq .",
    "( [ power ] ) .      in practice ,",
    "the instrument is limited by a finite primary beamwidth given by the aperture function . inserting the aperture function with tracking direction @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ vt ] ) , we have @xmath79 doing the expansions  ( [ expand ] ) and ( [ expon ] ) , assuming a gaussian beam  ( [ beam ] ) , and using eq .  ( [ add2 ] ) , eq .  ( [ vtb ] ) becomes @xmath80 where the square root of the window function is @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the spin-@xmath83 spherical harmonics ( see appendix  a ) .",
    "( [ vtw ] ) is the general result for the complex visibility of the cmb observed by an interferometer with two identical gaussian primary beams separated by a baseline @xmath32 .",
    "however , it is difficult to get any useful information from its present form . in the following ,",
    "we will pursue two configurations for which eq .",
    "( [ vtw ] ) can be boiled down to useful forms .",
    "the first one is the `` close - packed '' configuration with the dishes almost in touching , i.e. , @xmath84 .",
    "this configuration is commonly adopted in cmb observations in order to maximize the size of the dish to obtain optimal sensitivity for signal detection .",
    "the second is the `` widespread '' configuration in which the length of the baseline is much longer than the diameter of the dish , i.e. , @xmath85 .",
    "this configuration is needed when one wants to resolve the fine structure of an image .",
    "let us start by analyzing the interference function , which is composed of the spherical bessel function @xmath86 .",
    "typically , the baseline @xmath87 . for large argument",
    ", @xmath61 has a sharp peak at @xmath88 .",
    "the asymptotic expansion in the peaked region is given by  @xcite @xmath89 and ai(@xmath90 ) is the airy function .",
    "thus , for a fixed @xmath66 , the location and width of the peak are approximately given by @xmath91 in addition , the height of the peak is given by @xmath92 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we have used the asymptotic expansion  ( [ asymj ] ) to reproduce the interference function in eq .",
    "( [ intf ] ) .",
    "it shows that the asymptote is a fairly good approximation .    in the close - packed configuration",
    ", we denotes the minimum spacing @xmath93 , where from eq .",
    "( [ bw ] ) @xmath94 because the dominant contribution in the @xmath95-summation in eq .",

    "the latter enables us to retain only @xmath102 in the @xmath101-summation in eq .",
    "( [ vtw ] ) , which then becomes @xmath103 in the close - packed configuration , we usually have the condition that @xmath104 . as such ,",
    "as compared to the window function , the interference function can be treated as a delta function at @xmath105 , where @xmath106 . for @xmath107",
    ", we have @xmath108 .",
    "hence , we approximate @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ cpv1 ] ) , which then turns into the final form , @xmath110 where the window function is @xmath111 the result  ( [ cpv2 ] ) shows that the baseline vector appears only in the irrelevant phase factor , and thus that the close - packed interferometric beam is similar to a single - beam antenna undergoing chopping and wobbling . in fact , this similarity has been pointed out in an early cmb interferometric measurement  @xcite .",
    "so , when we attempt to construct the two - point correlation function similar to eq .",
    "( [ cf ] ) with @xmath112 , we obtain a pure phase function which does not contain any useful information .",
    "the reason is simply that the correlation over the domain in the @xmath32-space spanned by @xmath113 and @xmath114 , whose size is still comparable to the size of the dish , is almost a constant . in light of this , in eq .",
    "( [ cpv2 ] ) we have replaced @xmath115 by @xmath116 to reflect that it is more legitimate to deal with the visibility in @xmath10-space than in @xmath32-space .",

    "then , using the asymptotic formula @xmath122 we can further approximate the window function as @xmath123 which is independent of @xmath101 in the asymptotic limit . furthermore , when the condition @xmath124 is satisfied , the window function can be treated as a delta function , @xmath125 plugging eqs .",
    "( [ wsdf ] ) and ( [ yy ] ) in eq .  ( [ vtw ] )",
    ", we finally obtain @xmath126 which does not depend on the tracking direction .",
    "the structure of this equation is similar to eq .",
    "( [ vtl ] ) , and thus the discussions following eq .",
    "( [ vtl ] ) in sec .",
    "[ inf ] are equally applied to eq .",
    "( [ vtl2 ] ) .",
    "although the visibility  ( [ vtl2 ] ) is reduced by the finite beam size , it enables us to make independent measurements of the visibility by pointing the telescope to different uncorrelated patches of the sky .",
    "then , we can extract the @xmath16 s from the visibility data on the u - sphere for each pointing .",
    "so , if we have @xmath127 uncorrelated pointings and a full u - sphere coverage for each pointing , the cosmic variance of the estimation of @xmath16 s will be reduced by a factor of @xmath128 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the inevitable cosmic variance in single - dish experiments due to the existence of a single universe can be in principle circumvented in the interferometry .",
    "however , the widespread condition requires @xmath129 , meaning a very high resolution scale at which the primary cmb anisotropies have very low power .",
    "we have learned in the previous section that the resolution which we have in @xmath2-space for a single pointing of the close - packed interferometer is equal to the size of the primary beam .",
    "however , we can increase the @xmath2-resolution by combining several contiguous pointings of the telescope .",
    "this is analogous to the fraunhofer diffraction in optics , in which narrower interference fringes are obtained by using many apertures . in ref .",
    "@xcite , they have demonstrated a case in which the resulting aperture in the @xmath66-plane can be made much narrower by considering @xmath130 pointings on a regular grid .",
    "here we can show the increase of @xmath2-resolution by combining various pointings of @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( [ vtw ] ) .",
    "the simplest case is to sum over all pointing directions , @xmath131 where we have used the orthonormality condition  ( [ ortho ] ) to evaluate the integration .",
    "this shows that the @xmath2-resolution is now determined by the interference function rather than the window function .",
    "it means that the resolution in @xmath2 is increased from @xmath132 to @xmath133 . since eq .",
    "( [ resol ] ) is a general result , it can be applied to the widespread configuration in sec .",
    "[ wsp ] as well , where the @xmath2-resolution is already given by @xmath133 .",
    "thus we conclude that in interferometry the @xmath2-resolution can be increased by combining telescope pointings up to a limit set by the intrinsic interference function .",
    "in the single - dish cmb experiment , a pixelized map of the cmb smoothed with a gaussian beam is created . in each pixel",
    ", the signal has a contribution from the cmb and from the instrumental noise . a convenient way of describing the amount of instrumental noise is to specify the rms noise per pixel @xmath134 , which depends on the detector sensitivity @xmath83 and the time spent observing each pixel @xmath135 : @xmath136 . the noise in each pixel is uncorrelated with that in any other pixel , and is uncorrelated with the cmb component .",

    "we have presented a full - sky analysis of the monochromatic cmb complex visibilities .",

    "it has an advantage over the flat - sky approximation for the interference function being positively definite , whereas the flat - sky interference function is rapidly oscillating about the zero . in the latter ,",
    "care must be taken in summing over @xmath2 for a flat spectrum due to significant cancellations  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have found that the flat - sky approximation generally underestimates the power spectrum .    a full - sky expression in eq .",
    "( [ vtw ] ) for the cmb complex visibility is our main result .",
    "it serves as the basis for analyzing the @xmath2-resolution in a given visibility , especially when a large sky scanning is needed in order to obtain a high resolution in @xmath2-space .",
    "we have shown in eq .",
    "( [ resol ] ) that the full - sky scanning can increase the @xmath2-resolution from maximal @xmath208 to @xmath209 .",
    "one should further check whether the resolution increases linearly with the sky coverage .",
    "we have worked out two limiting cases of the visibility equation  ( [ vtw ] ) in which the statistics of the visibility becomes transparent .",
    "firstly , we have shown that the close - packed interferometer is functioning like a single - dish switching experiment .",
    "therefore , on the issue of obtaining hign @xmath2-resolution , it is important to study and compare the efficiency of the the usual method of synthesis imaging of the sky against that of the aforementioned sky scanning method .",
    "secondly , we have suggested for the widespread configuration that one should analyse the visibility data on the u - sphere .",
    "we have also pointed out that the interferometry can in principle avoid the cosmic variance by obtaining different u - spheres via multiple pointings of the telescope to uncorrelated patches of the cmb sky .",
    "it is interesting to study how to implement this concept in practical situations .    in this paper , we have performed the calculations assuming a monochromatic electromagnetic source , and allowing a nonvanishing geometrical delay @xmath210 , which measures the elapsed time for the wavefront reaching one antenna and then the other .",
    "however , when observing with a finite bandwidth @xmath146 , one usually correlates signals at two separate points on the same wavefront in order to obtain full fringe .",
    "this can be done by including within the interferometric system a computer - controlled phase delay to compensate for @xmath211  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the interferometer response is @xmath212 this is a fourier transform with conjugate variables @xmath55 and @xmath211 , and can be inverted to extract the desired @xmath213 .",
    "finally , we remark that cmb interferometric observations are radically different from traditional radio interferometry .",
