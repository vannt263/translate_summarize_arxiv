    "optical systems such as cameras , spectrometers , and microscopes are conventionally made by assembling discrete bulk optical components like lenses , gratings and filters .",
    "the optical components are manufactured separately using cutting , polishing and grinding , and have to be assembled with tight alignment tolerances , a process that is becoming more challenging as the optical systems shrink in size .",
    "furthermore , the continuous progress of mobile , wearable , and portable consumer electronics and medical devices has rapidly increased the demand for high - performance and low - cost miniature optical systems .",
    "optical metasurfaces offer an alternative approach for realization of optical components  @xcite .",
    "recent advances have increased their efficiency and functionalities , thus allowing metasurface diffractive optical components with comparable or superior performance than conventional optical components  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of metasurfaces stems from the capability to make sophisticated planar optical systems composed of lithographically stacked electronic and metasurface layers .",
    "the resulting optical system is aligned lithographically , thus eliminating the need for post - fabrication alignments .",
    "the development of the optoelectronic image sensor has been a significant step towards the on - chip integration of cameras  @xcite ; however , the camera lenses are yet to be fully integrated with the image sensor .",
    "the freedom in controlling the metasurface phase profiles has enabled implementation of spherical - aberration - free flat lenses that focus normally incident light to diffraction limited spots  @xcite .",
    "such lenses have been used in applications requiring focusing of an optical beam or collimating emission from an optical fibre  @xcite or a semiconductor laser  @xcite .",
    "however , the metasurface lenses suffer from other monochromatic aberrations ( i.e. coma and astigmatism ) , which reduce their field of view and hinder their adoption in imaging applications where having a large field of view is an essential requirement .",
    "a metasurface lens can be corrected for coma if it is patterned on the surface of a sphere  @xcite , but direct patterning of nano - structures on curved surfaces is challenging . although conformal metasurfaces might provide a solution  @xcite , the resulting device would not be flat . as we show here , another approach for correcting monochromatic aberrations of a metasurface lens is through cascading and forming a metasurface doublet lens .    here",
    ", we show a doublet lens formed by cascading two metasurfaces can be corrected over a wide range of incident angles .",

    "the aberrations of two cascaded phase plates surrounded by vacuum have been studied previously in the context of holographic lenses , and it has been shown that such a combination can realize a fisheye lens with significantly reduced monochromatic aberrations  @xcite .",

    "2a  @xcite .",
    "the metasurfaces are composed of hexagonal arrays of amorphous silicon nano - posts with different diameters which rest on a fused silica substrate and are covered by the su-8 polymer .",
    "the nano - posts behave as truncated waveguides with circular cross sections supporting fabry - prot resonances  @xcite .",
    "the high refractive index between the nano - posts and their surroundings leads to weak optical coupling among the nano - posts and allows for the implementation of any phase profile with subwavelength resolution by spatially varying the diameters of the nano - posts .",
    "simulated intensity transmission and phase of the transmission coefficient for different nano - post diameters are presented in fig .",
    "2b , showing that 2@xmath4 phase coverage is achieved with an average transmission over 96% ( see methods for details ) .",
    "* device fabrication*. we fabricated the metasurfaces on both sides of a fused silica substrate by depositing amorphous silicon and defining the nano - post pattern using e - beam lithography and dry etching ( see methods for the details ) .",
    "first , the correcting metasurfaces were patterned on the top side of the substrate , and then the focusing metasurfaces were aligned and patterned on the substrate s bottom side ( as schematically shown in fig .",
    "2c ) . to protect the metasurfaces",
    "while processing the other side of the substrate , the metasurfaces were cladded by a layer of cured su-8 polymer .",

    "3a ) , and measuring its focal spot and focusing efficiency . for comparison , a spherical - aberration - free singlet metasurface lens with the same aperture diameter and focal length as the doublet lens ( phase profile @xmath5 , @xmath6 : radial coordinate , @xmath7=717 @xmath3 m : focal length , @xmath8=800 @xmath3 m : aperture diameter )",
    "was also fabricated and characterized .",
    "the focal spots of the metasurface doublet and singlet lenses were measured with two different polarizations of incident light and are shown along with the corresponding simulation results in fig . 3b and 3c , respectively ( see methods for details ) .",
    "the doublet lens has a nearly diffraction limited focal spot for incident angles up to more than 25@xmath1 ( with the criterion of strehl ratio of larger than 0.9 , see supplementary fig .",
    "1 ) while the singlet exhibits significant aberrations even at incident angles of a few degrees .",
    "as figs 3b and 3c show , simulated and measured spot shapes agree well .",
    "for the doublet lens , a small asymmetry in the 0@xmath1 spot shape and slightly larger aberrations are observed in the measured spots compared to the simulation results , which we attribute to a misalignment ( estimated @xmath92 @xmath3 m along both @xmath10 and @xmath11 directions ) between the top and bottom side patterns ( see supplementary fig .",
    "2 ) .    the focusing efficiency ( ratio of the focused power to the incident power ) for the metasurface doublet lens is shown in fig .",
    "3d , and is @xmath970% for normally incident light .",
    "the focusing efficiency is polarization dependent , and its value for unpolarized light drops at the rate of @xmath91% per degree as the incident angle increases .",
    "the measured focusing efficiency at normal incidence is lower than the average of the transmission shown in fig .",
    "2b because of the large numerical aperture ( na ) of the focusing metasurface  @xcite , undesired scattering due to the sidewall roughness of the nano - posts , residual reflection at the air / su-8 interfaces , and measurement artefacts ( see methods for details ) .",
    "the metasurfaces are polarization insensitive at normal incidence , but their diffraction efficiency depends on the polarization of incident light for non - zero incident angles . the focusing efficiency is lower for the transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarized light compared with the transverse electric ( te ) polarized light because of the excitation of some resonances of the nano - posts with the axial component of the electric field of the incident light  @xcite .",
    "this also causes the slight difference between the te and tm spot shapes for the 30@xmath1 incident light shown in fig .",
    "we measured a focusing efficiency of @xmath975% for the singlet , and did not observe a detectable difference between the focal spots measured with te and tm polarizations .",
    "the measured relative location of the doublet lens focal spot as a function of incident angle is shown in fig .",
    "3e along with the @xmath12 curve .",
    "the good agreement between the measured data and the curve indicates that the metasurface doublet lens can be used as an orthographic fisheye lens or a wide angle fourier transform lens  @xcite . also , the specific @xmath12 fisheye distortion of the image leads to a uniform brightness over the image plane  @xcite .",
    "* imaging performance*. we characterized the imaging performance of the metasurface doublet lens using the experimental setup shown in fig .",
    "a pattern printed on a letter - size paper was used as an object .",
    "the object was placed @xmath925 cm away from the metasurface doublet lens and was illuminated by an led ( centre wavelength : 850 nm , bandwidth : 40 nm , spectrum shown in supplementary fig .",
    "the image formed by the doublet lens was magnified by @xmath910@xmath13 using an objective and a tube lens and captured by a camera . a bandpass filter with 10 nm bandwidth ( see supplementary fig . 3 for the spectrum )",
    "was used to spectrally filter the image and reduce the effect of chromatic aberration on the image quality .",
    "figure 4b shows the image captured by the camera , and its insets depict the zoomed - in views of the image at 0@xmath1 , 15@xmath1 and 30@xmath1 view angles . for comparison ,",
    "an image captured using the same setup but with the metasurface singlet lens is shown in fig .",
    "4c . the objective lens used for magnifying the images has a smaller na than the metasurface lenses and limits the resolution of the captured images ( see supplementary fig . 4 for an image taken with a higher na objective ) .",
    "any imaging system can be considered as low pass spatial filter whose transfer function varies across the field of view . for incoherent imaging systems , the transfer function for each point in the field of view can be obtained by computing the fourier transform of the focal spot intensity .",
    "the modulus of this transfer function is referred to as the modulation transfer function ( mtf ) and represents the relative contrast of the image versus the spatial details of the object .",
    "the mtfs for the metasurface doublet and singlet lenses were computed using the measured focal spots ( figs 3b and 3c ) and are shown in figs 4d and 4e , respectively .",
    "both the images and the mtfs shown in figs 4b - d demonstrate the effectiveness of correction achieved by cascading two metasurfaces , and the diffraction limited performance of the metasurface doublet lens over a wide field of view .",
    "* miniature metasurface camera*. to further demonstrate the use of this technology in imaging applications , we realized a miniature planar camera by using a metasurface doublet lens and a cmos image sensor as schematically shown in fig .",
    "4f . to compensate for the light propagating through the cover glass protecting the image sensor ,",
    "another doublet lens was optimized ( see metasurface doublet lens ii in supplementary fig .",
    "the total dimensions of the camera ( including the image sensor ) are 1.6 mm@xmath131.6 mm @xmath131.7 mm .",
    "the miniature camera was characterized using the setup shown in fig .",
    "4 g and by imaging the object shown in fig .",
    "4a which was illuminated by a filtered led ( centre wavelength : 850 nm , bandwidth : 10 nm , see supplementary fig . 3 for the spectrum ) .",
    "the image captured by the image sensor is also shown in fig .",
    "4 g which shows a wide field - of - view .",
    "the camera s image quality is reduced by the nonuniform sensitivity of the image sensor pixels to the 850 nm light due to the colour filters , and by its larger - than - optimal pixel size .",
    "therefore , the image quality can be improved by using a monochromatic image sensor with a smaller pixel size ( the optimum pixel size for the miniature camera is @xmath90.4 @xmath3 m based on the mtfs shown in fig .",
    "thus , the miniature camera benefits from the current technological trend in pixel size reduction .",
    "the intensity of the image formed by a camera only depends on the na of its lens ( it is proportional to 1/_f_-number@xmath14=4na@xmath14  @xcite ) ; therefore , the metasurface miniature camera collects a small optical power but forms a high brightness image .",
    "furthermore , the metasurface doublet lens is telecentric in the image space , and light is incident on the image sensor with the uniform angular distribution ( see supplementary fig .",
    "5 ) , and thus removing the need for the variable incident angle correction in the image sensor .    *",
    "correcting chromatic abberations*. the metasurface doublet lens suffers from chromatic aberrations that reduce the image quality of the miniature camera as the illumination bandwidth increases .",
    "simulated focal spots of the metasurface doublet lens for different illumination bandwidths and the corresponding mtfs are shown in figs 5a and 5b , respectively .",
    "see supplementary fig . 6 for the off - axis mtfs .",
    "as it can be seen from the mtfs , the imaging resolution decreases as the illumination bandwidth increases .",
    "this effect can be seen as reduced contrast and lower resolution in the image shown in fig .",
    "5c ( 40 nm bandwidth illumination ) compared with the image shown in fig .",
    "5d ( 10 nm bandwidth illuminations ) . for the imaging purpose ,",
    "the fractional bandwidth of a metasurface lens is proportional to @xmath15 ( see supplementary note 1 ) and can be increased by reducing the na of the metasurface lens and its focal length . also , since the mtfs of the metasurface doublet lens shown in fig .",
    "5b have significant high frequency components , the unfavourable effect of chromatic aberration can to some extent be corrected using wiener deconvolution  @xcite .",
    "figure 5e shows the deconvolution results of the image shown in fig .",
    "5c that is taken with a 40-nm - bandwidth illumination ( see methods for the details ) .",
    "as expected , the deconvolved image appears sharper and has a higher contrast than the original image ; however , deconvolution also amplifies the noise , limiting its applicability for correcting the chromatic aberrations over a significantly wider bandwidth .",
    "the metasurface doublet lens and camera can be further miniaturized by reducing the thickness of the substrate , the diameters of the metasurface lenses , the focal length of the lens , and the distance to the image sensor by the same scale factor , while using the same nano - post metasurface design presented in fig .",
    "2 . for example , a 10@xmath13 smaller camera ( 160 @xmath3m@xmath13160 @xmath3m@xmath13170 @xmath3 m ) can be designed and fabricated using a similar procedure on a 100-@xmath3m - thick fused silica substrate .",
    "such a camera would have 10@xmath13 larger bandwidth compared to the miniature camera presented here , the same image plane intensity , but with 10@xmath13 smaller image and 100@xmath13 lower number of distinguishable pixels ( 94@xmath1394 pixels instead of 940@xmath13940 ) . compared to other miniature lenses",
    "reported previously  @xcite and awaiba naneye camera ( ` http://www.awaiba.com ` ) , the metasurface doublet offers significantly smaller _ f_-number and better correction for monochromatic aberrations which lead to brighter images with higher resolution ; however , they have larger chromatic aberration ( i.e. narrower bandwidth ) .    the miniature metasurface camera concept can be extended for colour and hyperspectral imaging by using a set of metasurfaces that are designed for different centre wavelengths and fabricated side by side on the same chip .",
    "each of the metasurface doublet lenses forms an image on a portion of a single monochromatic image sensor .",
    "high quality thin - film colour filters with different centre wavelengths can be directly deposited on the correcting metasurface of each doublet lens , and the colour filter efficiency issues associated with small size colour filters will be avoided  @xcite . also , multiwavelength metasurface lenses which work at multiple discrete wavelengths have been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "however , the multiwavelength metasurfaces exhibit the same chromatic dispersion ( i.e. @xmath16 ) and thus similar chromatic aberrations as the single wavelength metasurface lenses .",
    "the amorphous silicon metasurfaces have negligible absorption loss for wavelengths above 650 nm . for shorter wavelength , materials with lower absorption loss such as polycrystalline silicon",
    ", gallium phosphide , titanium dioxide  @xcite , or silicon nitride  @xcite can be used .",
    "the metasurface - enabled camera we reported here has a flat and thin form factor , small _",
    "f_-number , exhibits nearly diffraction limited performance over a large field of view . from a manufacturing standpoint ,",
    "the metasurface doublets have several advantages over conventional lens modules .",
    "conventional lens modules are composed of multiple lenses which are separately manufactured and later aligned and assembled together to form the module . on the other hand ,",
    "the metasurface doublets are batch manufactured with simultaneous fabrication of tens of thousands of doublets on each wafer , and with the metasurfaces aligned to each other using lithographic steps during fabrication .",
    "furthermore , the assembly of the conventional lens modules with the image sensors has to be done in a back - end step , but the metasurface doublet can be monolithically stacked on top of image sensors . more generally , this work demonstrates a vertical on - chip integration architecture for designing and manufacturing optical systems , which is enabled through high performance metasurfaces .",
    "this architecture will enable low - cost realization of conventional optical systems ( e.g. spectrometers , 3d scanners , projectors , microscopes , etc . ) , and systems with novel functionalities in a thin and planar form factor with immediate applications in medical imaging and diagnostics , surveillance , and consumer electronics .",
    "* simulation and design . * the phase profiles of the two metasurfaces composing the doublet lenses were obtained through the ray tracing technique using a commercial optical design software ( zemax opticstudio , zemax llc ) .",
    "the phase profiles were defined as even order polynomials of the radial coordinate @xmath6 as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the radius of the metasurface , and the coefficients @xmath19 were optimized for minimizing the focal spot size ( root mean square spot size ) at incident angles up to 30@xmath1 .",
    "two different metasurface doublet lenses were designed . the first doublet lens ( metasurface doublet lens i ) is optimized for focusing incident light in air , and was used in measurements shown in figs 3 and 4b , d .",

    "the simulation results shown in figs 1b , d , figs 2b , c , and supplementary fig . 2 were computed assuming the metasurfaces operate as ideal phase masks ( i.e. their phase profile is independent of the incident angle ) .",
