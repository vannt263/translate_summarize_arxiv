    "after the discovery of a higgs boson at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , we have completed to find all the elementary particles predicted in the standard model ( sm ) , and the mechanism for the mass generation of the weak gauge bosons  @xcite have also been confirmed .",
    "however , there are puzzles in the mechanism for the generation of fermion masses in the sm .",
    "first , neutrino masses are exactly predicted to be zero , although the establishment of existence of the neutrino oscillation suggests that neutrinos have tiny but non - zero masses typically of order 0.1 ev .",
    "that is one of strong reasons that we need to consider physics beyond the sm .",
    "next , all the masses of charged fermions are given through the yukawa interaction . because only the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs doublet field is the dimension full parameter in the sm , the magnitude of the measured fermion masses are accommodated by tuning the yukawa coupling constants .",
    "that causes an unnatural situation especially for the charged - lepton sector .",
    "for instance , the electron mass is about 0.5 mev which is obtained by taking the electron yukawa coupling to be order of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the questions are then following ; ( i ) why lepton masses are quite small compared to the electroweak scale , i.e. , @xmath4 gev , ( ii ) why there is a large hierarchy between masses for neutrinos and those for charged - leptons . for instance",
    ", there is a difference of 6 orders between neutrino masses and the electron mass .",
    "one of the attractive scenarios to explain the smallness of neutrino masses are known as so - called radiative seesaw models  @xcite in which neutrino masses are generated through quantum levels . in ref .",
    "@xcite , another type of the radiative seesaw model has been proposed , in which the masses for the first and second generation quarks and charged - leptons are generated at the one - loop level .",
    "however , the above scenarios can not explain the smallness of the masses for both charged - leptons and neutrinos simultaneously , and those hierarchy .    in this paper , we propose a new radiative seesaw model .",
    "the dirac masses for charged - leptons and majorana masses for neutrinos are respectively generated from the one - loop induced dimension five operators as @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the left ( right ) handed lepton field , and @xmath8 is the isospin doublet scalar field . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the isospin triplet scalar fields with the hypercharge @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "typical mass scales are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the mass hierarchy between charged - leptons and neutrinos can be explained by the vevs of triplet scalar fields which have to be much smaller than the doublet vev because of the constraint from the electroweak rho parameter .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we define our model , and we give the lagrangian relevant to the generation of the lepton masses . in sec .",
    "iii , several observables in the lepton sector are calculated , e.g. , masses for the charged - leptons and neutrinos , the muon @xmath2 , and lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes .",
    "iv is devoted to disucss the collider phenomenology in our model .",
    "conclusions and discussions are given in sec .",
    "v.    .the particle contents and their charge assignments under @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the global lepton number symmetry .",
    "the index @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) for @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) runs over the first , second and third ( first and second ) generation .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have constructed the new type of the radiative seesaw model which provides masses for charged - leptons and neutrinos at the one - loop level in a tev scale physics . in our model , the mass hierarchy between charged - leptons and neutrinos is naturally explained due to the smallness of the vevs of triplet higgs fields and the lepton number violating yukawa coupling constant . in table",
    "[ tab:2 ] , we summarize the typical values of the parameters giving correct orders of the masses of charged - leptons and neutrinos under the assumptions in eq .",
    "( [ assump ] ) . we have found that the deviation in the measured muon @xmath2 from the sm prediction can be explained in the parameter sets given in table  [ tab:2 ] by the loop effects of the vector - like leptons @xmath19 and extra neutral @xmath0-odd scalar bosons .",
    "the decay rate of @xmath20 can be neglected in this case due to the diagonal structure of the @xmath21 matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ dela2 ] ) .",
    "we then have discussed the collider phenomenology focusing on two pairs of doubly - charged scalar bosons .",
    "our model has several bosonic dark matter candidates ; namely , the lightest neutral @xmath0-odd scalar boson @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 or @xmath25 . in the case of @xmath26 doublet - like scalar boson ( @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) , it has been already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the dark matter mass is in favor of at around the half of the observed higgs boson mass , i.e. , about 63 gev , from the constraint of wmap and the direct detection search in xenon100 . in the case of @xmath26 singlet - like boson ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) , it could explain the fermi - lat 130 gev @xmath27-ray excess  @xcite based on the model in ref .",
    "@xcite if the mixing angles @xmath28 and @xmath29 are tiny enough to satisfy the current upper bound reported by xenon lux  @xcite .",
    "such a situation can be achieved in our framework .",
