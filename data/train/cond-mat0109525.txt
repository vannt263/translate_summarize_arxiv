    "the @xmath0 hubbard model at half filling is not elementary , even in the innocent - looking case of finite @xmath3 and small repulsion @xmath29 . indeed ,",
    "weak - coupling expansions have long been known to be highly informative @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the reason is that the trivial @xmath30 case is @xmath31 times degenerate , and so even for relatively small lattices one has to solve a big secular problem to see how the interaction resolves the degeneracy in first - order . to deal with this problem , recently@xcite@xcite we have proposed a _",
    "formalism , based on diagonalizing the occupation number operators in the degenerate eigenstates of the kinetic energy @xmath28 .",
    "we came out with an analytic singlet wave function @xmath1}_{af}\\ket$ ] which solves the secular problem and belongs to the ground eigenvalue of @xmath16 . under a lattice step translation",
    "it just flips spins ( _ antiferromagnetic property _ ) .",
    "further we proved that it has vanishing momentum and its point symmetry is the same as the ground state symmetry established by moreo and dagotto@xcite .",
    "we believe that @xmath1}_{af}\\ket$ ] clearly deserves further study : although it is an eigenstate only at the first order in @xmath29 , it must represent a good deal of the properties of the full ground state . here",
    "we wish to show that the same _ local _ formalism that allows one to build @xmath1}_{af}\\ket$ ] , is also suitable to bring out some physics .",
    "it is clear that the importance of analytic results is actually enhanced in the age of computers , since they can benchmark the numerical approximations .",

    "studies@xcite of correlation functions in the three - band hubbard model have been aimed to the characterization of possible pairing mechanisms short after the discovery of high-@xmath36 superconductivity@xcite .",
    "much of the early work dealt with the one - band model at strong coupling .",
    "let us mention the exact diagonalization study by kaxiras and manousakis@xcite on the @xmath37 lattice , showing the antiferromagnetic order at half filling ; the diagrammatic approach by gebhard and vollhardt@xcite used the gutzwiller ansatz , mainly for the 1@xmath38 chain .",
    "correlation functions on larger lattices of the one - band @xcite , and , more recently , of the three - band hubbard model@xcite@xcite have been obtained by quantum - monte - carlo methods .",
    "they have also been used to benchmark the self - consistent theory by vilk et al.@xcite , which is basically a generalized random - phase approximation .    after summarizing the local formalism and the ground state solution in section [ ground ]",
    ", we go over in section [ parth ] to a new picture by a particle - hole canonical transformation which is convenient to calculate the correlation functions .",
    "we derive the spin correlation function in section [ spin ] and the charge one in section [ charge ] .",
    "the results are discussed and compared with available data in section [ comp ] .",
    "in order to estabilish some notations we need to review the ground state formalism@xcite , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath39 denote the set ( or shell ) of the @xmath40 wave vectors such that @xmath41 . at half filling ( @xmath42 particles ) for @xmath30 the @xmath39 shell is half occupied , while all @xmath43 orbitals such that @xmath44 are filled .",
    "the @xmath40 vectors of @xmath39 lie on the square having vertices @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; one readily realizes that the dimension of the set @xmath39 , is @xmath47 .",
    "since @xmath3 is even and @xmath16 commutes with the total spin operators , @xmath48 at half filling every ground state of @xmath28 is represented in the @xmath49 subspace .",
    "thus , @xmath28 has @xmath31 degenerate unperturbed ground state configurations with @xmath49",
    ".    it can be shown@xcite that the structure of the first - order wave functions is gained by diagonalizing @xmath50 in the _ truncated hilbert space @xmath51 _ spanned by the _ states of @xmath52 holes of each spin in @xmath39_. in other terms , one solves a @xmath53-particle problem in the truncated hilbert space @xmath51 and then , understanding the particles in the filled shells , obtains the first - order eigenfunctions of @xmath16 in the full @xmath42-particle problem .",
    "we emphasize that the matrix of @xmath28 in @xmath51 is null , since by construction @xmath51 is contained in the kernel of @xmath28 .",
    "the large set @xmath39 breaks into small pieces if we take full advantage of the @xmath54 symmetry .",
    "any plane - wave state @xmath40 belongs to a one - dimensional irrep of @xmath55 ; moreover , it also belongs to a _ star _ of @xmath40 vectors connected by operations of @xmath15 , and one member of the star has @xmath56 .",
    "we recall that any @xmath57 lies on a square with vertices on the axes at the brillouin zone boundaries .",
    "choosing an arbitrary @xmath57 with @xmath56 , hence @xmath58 , the set of vectors @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , is a basis for an irrep of @xmath54 .",
    "the high symmetry vectors @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the basis of the only two - dimensional irrep of @xmath54 , which exists for any @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath63 is even , one also finds the high symmetry wavevectors @xmath64 which mix among themselves under @xmath15 operations and yield a four - dimensional irrep . in general , when @xmath40 is not in a special symmetry direction , the vectors @xmath65 are all different , so all the other irreps of @xmath54 have dimension 8 , the number of operations of the point group @xmath15 .",
    "below , we shall need the number of these irreps . since 8 times the number of eight - dimensional irreps + 4 times that of four - dimensional ones + 2 for the only two - dimensional irrep must yield @xmath47",
    ", one finds that @xmath39 contains @xmath66 irreps of dimension 8 if @xmath63 is even and @xmath67 irreps of dimension 8 if @xmath63 is odd .    in this way",
    ", @xmath39 is seen to be the union of disjoint bases of irreps of the space group .",
    "this break - up of @xmath68 enables us to define a _",
    "real _ symmetry adapted one - body _ local _ basis which allows to carry on the analysis for any @xmath3 .",
    "the one - body _ local _ basis is obtained by projecting onto the irreps of @xmath15 the @xmath43 states of @xmath39 that belong to a given irrep of @xmath54 .",
    "as already noted , @xmath69 and @xmath70 belong to @xmath39 and are the basis of a two - dimensional irrep of @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath71 and carry symmetry labels ; actually the symmetries are @xmath72 and @xmath73 because the two - dimensional irrep of @xmath54 breaks into @xmath74 in @xmath75 .",
    "in @xmath54 these two functions merge into one irrep because the @xmath40 states pick up phase factors from the translations .    for even @xmath63",
    ", @xmath39 also comprises the basis wave vectors @xmath76 of the 4-dimensional irrep of @xmath54 .",
    "this irrep breaks into @xmath77 in @xmath75 . letting @xmath78 for the irreps @xmath79 respectively ,",
    "we can write down four more real local states @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the @xmath82 unitary matrix which performs the projections , namely , @xmath83.\\ ] ] for @xmath84 , @xmath39 also contains @xmath40 vectors that are away from special symmetry directions .",
    "these form eight - dimensional irreps of @xmath85 since @xmath65 are all different for all @xmath86 .",
    "in other terms , any eight - dimensional irrep of @xmath85 is the regular representation of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , by the burnside theorem , it breaks into @xmath87 , with the two - dimensional irrep occurring twice ; these are the symmetry labels of the local orbitals we are looking for .",

    "finally we emphasize that in @xmath122}_{af}\\ket$ ] only @xmath126 particles are antiferromagnetically correlated while in the strong coupling limit all the @xmath42 particles show antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "@xmath122}_{af}\\ket$ ] is an exact ground state of @xmath16 for @xmath127 .",
    "does this mean that it is the @xmath127 limit of the unique interacting ground state ?",
    "we know that this is the case for the @xmath82 and @xmath128 square lattices , where we have numerical evidence that @xmath122}_{af}\\ket$ ] is the only singlet eigenstate in @xmath51 with vanishing eigenvalue .",
    "the correlation functions that we find below behave quite reasonably also for @xmath129 and this strongly suggests that @xmath122}_{af}\\ket$ ] continues to be a good approximation to the true ground state at weak coupling .",
    "a proof of the uniqueness of the vanishing eigenvalue of @xmath50 in the singlet subspace of @xmath51 would be sufficient ( although not necessary ) to prove that . in the next section we find further evidence to support this proposal : we write @xmath122}_{af}\\ket$ ] in the particle - hole transformed picture and show that the corresponding lieb matrix is positive semidefinite , as it should be for a genuine ground state@xcite .",
    "the unitary particle - hole transformation on a square @xmath6 lattice and even @xmath3 reads @xmath130 this transformation maps the repulsive hubbard model described in eq.([hamil ] ) onto the attractive one @xmath131 with @xmath132 and @xmath133 . letting @xmath134 be an orthonormal real basis of @xmath135-particle states ( that is , each @xmath136 must be an homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath135 in the @xmath137 with real coefficients acting on the vacuum ) , we remind that the ground state at half filling @xmath138}\\ket=\\sum_{\\g_{1}\\g_{2}}l_{\\g_{1}\\g_{2}}|\\q_{\\g_{1}\\ua}\\ket \\otimes|\\q_{\\g_{2}\\da}\\ket\\ ] ] is such that the lieb matrix @xmath139 is positive ( or negative ) semidefinite .    in this section",
    "we will perform the unitary particle - hole transformation in eq.([upht ] ) on the ground state of eqs.([detaf])([detafodd ] ) .",
    "we will show that the corresponding lieb matrix is indeed positive semidefinite ; besides , it is already diagonal in the local basis . as a consequence ,",
    "the ground state in the untransformed ( @xmath10 ) picture is a pseudospin ( as well as spin ) singlet .",
    "let @xmath140 , @xmath141 , be the operators which create a particle in the @xmath142-th local state contained in @xmath116 , eqs.([detaf])([detafodd ] ) .",

    "let us consider for example the @xmath305-th term of the sum in the second row of eq.([aotofa ] ) ; it contains states where @xmath305 of the last @xmath52 local states have spin down and @xmath305 of the first @xmath52 local states have spin up .",

    "in particular this implies that the terms where the first and the last @xmath52 local states have all the spins aligned do not contribute to the scalar product .",
    "hence @xmath377 let us consider the term in the second row .",
    "for a given choice of @xmath378 one finds @xmath379 where the missed terms do not contribute to the scalar product . since the @xmath362 annihilation operator commutes with all the raising spin operators coming from the sum over @xmath380 , @xmath381 is constrained to be 1 for all non vanishing contributions . still for @xmath382 fixed",

    "the possible results for a given choice of @xmath382 and @xmath380 are 0 or 1 .",
