    "collisions of heavy nuclei at the relativistic heavy ion collider have created matter with energy densities exceeding the predicted threshold for deconfinement of color charge into a hot dense plasma  @xcite . in this quark gluon plasma(qgp ) , quarks and gluons are not bound within hadronic states and the matter behaves collectively .",
    "comparisons with hydrodynamic simulations indicate rapid thermalization of the colliding system into a hot dense nuclear medium .",
    "the produced medium affords an opportunity to study the properties of a new phase of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in an extreme environment .",
    "hard scattering with large momentum exchange between partons in the incoming nuclei is well - described by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "the scattered partons emerge back - to - back in azimuth in the plane transverse to the beam direction , and fragment into a pair of correlated cones of high momentum particles , referred to as jets .",
    "the study of jets and their hadronic fragments in heavy - ion collisions provides insight into the properties of hot dense nuclear matter .",
    "measurements of single high transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) particles  @xcite and correlations between high-@xmath3 particles  @xcite have demonstrated that the fast partons embedded in the produced medium dissipate a large amount of their initial kinetic energy .    in this paper , we present angular correlations of hadron pairs with both hadrons in the midrapidity range @xmath4 . fragments from the same jet form a peak at small relative azimuthal angle ( @xmath5 ) , i.e. the near - side peak .",
    "pairs composed of one fragment from each jet will appear in an away - side peak at @xmath6 .",
    "past measurements  @xcite for hadrons @xmath7 5 gev/@xmath1 have shown that the away - side correlations peak is suppressed relative to baseline measurements in @xmath8+@xmath8 collisions .",
    "the suppression of the away - side jet is a signature of parton energy loss inside the medium .",
    "the same measurements show that near - side jet fragments at large momentum are not suppressed .",
    "this feature of the data is understood to result from the requirement of a large momentum particle in the final state , which creates a bias towards small energy loss either by the preferential selection of hard scatterings near the medium surface  @xcite or due to fluctuations in energy loss  @xcite .",
    "the detailed mechanism by which partons lose energy when passing through a deconfined medium are not yet fully understood . in pqcd descriptions of the parton - medium interaction",
    "the predicted parton energy loss should scale as the path length squared  @xcite . in competing anti - de - sitter space / conformal field theory descriptions characterizing a strongly coupled medium , the energy loss scales as the path length cubed  @xcite .",
    "the variation in azimuthal angle of the away - side jet suppression with respect to the reaction plane ( @xmath9 ) is sensitive to the total amount of energy lost by the away - side parton along long paths ( out - of - plane ) or short paths ( in - plane ) through the medium .",
    "the degree to which the away - side jet suppression varies will be determined in part by the path - length scale of energy loss .",
    "single particle observables at high @xmath0 , such as the nuclear suppression with respect to the reaction plane ( @xmath10 ) or the azimuthal anisotropy ( i.e. @xmath11 )  @xcite , are also sensitive to this path - length variation of energy loss .",
    "current pqcd calculations predict a lower @xmath11 than is found in the data and may imply a larger than path length squared dependence to energy loss  @xcite .",
    "the reaction - plane dependence of the back - to - back jets provides an additional test on the path length dependence in that the two particle observable selects a different distribution of hard - scattering locations and should probe longer paths through the medium than single particle observables .",
    "the path - length dependence of both single and two particle observables have already been studied through selection of the collision centrality  @xcite .",
    "however , centrality selection varies not only the path length , but also other important properties of the medium ( e.g. the overall energy density ) .",
    "selection with respect to the reaction plane more directly varies the path lengths , while leaving the other medium properties unchanged .",
    "in addition to the uncertainties associated with the energy loss mechanisms , many of the details within hydrodynamic simulations of heavy - ion collisions have not been fully constrained and tested by experiment . for instance , one such uncertainty is the geometrical description of the energy deposited by the colliding nuclei which could contribute to the degree of away - side suppression variation with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "two competing descriptions , the glauber model  @xcite and the color glass condensate  @xcite , predict different azimuthal distributions of matter with respect to the reaction plane . thus the two descriptions give different in - plane and out - of - plane path lengths through the medium .",
    "these descriptions are also used as different starting points to the hydrodynamic evolution of the medium .",
    "other model uncertainties include , but are not limited to , the extent of geometry fluctuations , the time required for thermalization into a hydrodynamic medium , the characteristics of the phase transition to confined hadrons , and the conditions under which those hadrons become free - streaming particles into the vacuum .",
    "these ambiguities in the proper modeling of heavy - ion collisions can result in significant uncertainty in the extracted properties of the medium , such as the shear viscosity  @xcite .",
    "in midcentral collisions ( the middle 2060% of the total cross section ) the variation of the away - side suppression is expected to be largest as the collision zone is the most anisotropic .",
    "in contrast , central collisions are much more isotropic and so provide a sample of events with small anisotropy expected in the away - side suppression .",
    "for instance , in the glauber model , midcentral events will have a root - mean - square thickness through the medium of 3.2 fm in the in - plane direction versus 4.8 fm in the out - of - plane direction , which is a 50% variation in path length .",
    "however , for central 020% collisions , the path length through the medium varies from 5.0 fm in the in - plane direction to 5.8 fm in the out - of - plane direction , which is a much smaller 16% variation .",
    "it is notable that the thickness through the medium in midcentral collisions changes more with respect to the reaction plane than it does between central and midcentral collisions where the away - side suppression at large momentum is already known to vary  @xcite . also worth noting",
    "is that the largest thickness in midcentral collisions is comparable to the shortest thickness in central collisions .",
    "any prediction for the away - side suppression with respect to the reaction plane will be a convolution of the energy loss and a description of the space - time evolution of the medium . in the limit where the medium is never fully opaque to fast partons and",
    "the energy lost by the typical parton is some fraction of its initial energy , the away - side suppression will increase with angle with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "this results because the average path length through the medium of the recoil parton is longer when out of the reaction plane .",
    "it is possible , in the extreme limit of a medium with a large opaque core and thin transparent corona , the away - side suppression could instead weaken as the trigger particle orientation varies from the in - plane to out - of - plane directions .",
    "the weakening in the thin corona scenario results from two effects ; a larger relative number of scattering centers producing a pair of back - to - back final - state particles in the out - of - plane direction , but also the variation of the trigger particle multiplicity by angle with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "however , it is worth noting that a large core and thin corona is an extreme configuration .",
    "variations within more realistic models of the away - side suppression will be intermediate between these extreme scenarios .    in this paper , we present azimuthal correlation measurements between pairs of neutral pion trigger particles ( @xmath12 ) within @xmath13 47 gev/@xmath1 and charged hadron associated partner particles ( @xmath14 ) within @xmath15 34 , 45 , and 57 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "these combinations of final - state particle momentum ranges have previously been shown to be dominated by jet fragmentation as they are above medium - induced two - particle correlations which contribute significantly at lower momenta  @xcite .",
    "the low momentum structures ( the `` ridge '' and `` shoulder '' ) may be the result of parton - medium interactions ( e.g.  @xcite ) or global correlations from fluctuating initial conditions  @xcite . these fluctuations have substantially less impact at large pair momentum where the background contribution becomes small . in this study , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phisdef ] , using only particles at large pair momentum , the away - side ( @xmath16 ) suppression by trigger particle orientation with respect to the reaction plane ( @xmath17 ) is presented as a probe of both the mechanism of parton energy loss and the space - time evolution of matter created by the collisions of large nuclei .",

    "the new results presented in our paper have sufficient statistics to specify a trend in the away - side suppression in midcentral collisions at larger momentum where subtraction uncertainties are negligible .",
    "the results presented here are based on 3.4 billion minimum - bias au+au events recorded by the phenix detector in 2007 .",

    "collision centrality was determined by division into percentile of the integrated charge collected by beam - beam counters ( bbc )  @xcite located at @xmath24 between 3.0 and 3.9 .",
    "the timing between the arrival of charged particles in the north and south bbc was used to reconstruct the event position along the collision axis ( @xmath25-vertex ) , and to restrict the event sample to @xmath26 cm of the nominal interaction point of the two beams .",

    "neutral pion trigger particles are reconstructed from photon clusters measured by either lead - glass or lead - scintillator electromagnetic calorimeters ( emcal ) in the two central arms of phenix , in total covering @xmath42 and @xmath43 in azimuth  @xcite .",
    "clusters are subject to cuts based on the known response of the emcal , including noisy and low - response towers , as well as shower shape cuts .",
    "neutral pions are identified through the 2@xmath44 decay channel by pairing all photons within an event .",
    "incorrect pairings between photons create a broad combinatorial background under the @xmath45 mass peak .",
    "this background is minimized by requiring the reconstructed mass to lie near the @xmath45 mass peak .",
    "this requirement was 0.1250.160 mev/@xmath46 for central events , but was relaxed to 0.1200.165 mev/@xmath46 in midcentral events where the combinatorial background is lower .",
    "since combinatorial pairs are more often made with the abundant photons found at low energy , the energy asymmetry of the decay ( @xmath47 ) was restricted to be less than 0.5 for 05% central events .",
    "this was also relaxed slowly for more peripheral events until all pairs with asymmetries less than 0.7 were accepted .",
    "the tightness of the cuts was used to control the rate of combinatorial pairings such that @xmath45 trigger particles have a signal - to - background ratio averaged over the mass window of 4:1 in central collisions and 10:1 in midcentral collisions .",

    "the suppression of away - side jet fragments in the out - of - plane direction is larger than in the in - plane direction , the out - of - plane away - side jet peak having only @xmath109 of the yield of the in - plane direction .",
    "thus the large variation by angle with respect to the reaction plane is significant .",
    "assuming the modulation to be flow - like ( dominated by the second - order variation ) , the suppression pattern implies @xmath110 .",
