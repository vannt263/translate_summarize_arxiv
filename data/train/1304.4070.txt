    "although many of the interesting transport phenomena related to quantum dots ( qds ) including the coulomb blockade,@xmath0 kondo effect,@xmath1 fano resonance,@xmath2 pauli spin blockade,@xmath3 photon ( phonon ) assisted tunneling process@xmath4 and negative differential conductance,@xmath5 have already been extensively studied , there has been little reported on the effects of electron plasmon interactions ( epis ) on the tunneling current of qds .",
    "recently , epis have received considerable attention for their applications in nanophotonics , biology , and the harvesting of solar energy.@xmath6 much effort has been focused on the effects of epis on the optical properties of nanostructures.@xmath7 experiments can observe the strong effect of epis on the exciton spectrum of individual semiconductor qds arising from adjunctive metallic nanostructures@xmath8 .",
    "in the application of qd - based biosensor , the metal core / semiconductor shell qds play an crucial role.@xmath9 because this type qds can be readily coupled to detected proteins through electrostatic interactions . despite the measurement of optical spectra can resolve molecules,@xmath10 tunneling current spectra provide a high efficient means to identify molecules and address electrically a single nano - object.@xmath11 this inspires us to study the tunneling current through individual metal core / semiconductor shell qds for the application of nanoscale biosensor .",
    "however , it is difficult to avoid the proximity effect between such type qds since qds are randomly distributed.@xmath12 therefore , we consider a metal core / semiconductor shell qd molecule ( qdm ) embedded in a matrix connected to metallic electrodes shown in fig . 1 to clarify how the epis to influence the proximity effect resulting from interdot electron coulomb interactions , electron hopping process , and plasmon hopping between two qds in the absence of detected proteins .",
    "here , we consider nanoscale semiconductor qds , the energy levels separation of each qd is much larger than their on - site coulomb interactions and thermal energies .",
    "one energy level for each quantum dot is considered in this study .",
    "the two - level anderson model including epis is employed to simulate the qdm junction system as shown in fig .",
    "the hamiltonian of the qdm junction is given by @xmath13    @xmath14    where the first two terms describe the free electron gas at the left and right metallic electrodes .",

    "and @xmath35 is the coupling strength of epis .",
    "the last term involving @xmath36 describes the plasmon hopping between two metallic nanostructures .",
    "when metal nanostructures are close enough , the plasmonic modes on one nanostructure can couple with that on other nanostructures so that hopping of plasmons from one metallic nanostructure to other nanostructure becomes possible .",

    "in addition , @xmath47 has an extra term @xmath48 resulting from the plasmon hopping between the metal nanostructures , which vanishes under free plasmon average introduced later . under canonical transformation",
    ", we note that the narrowing of qd energy level broadening appears and qd energy levels , electron coulomb interactions , and electron interdot hopping strengths become renormalized as well .",
    "the proximity effect between qds resulting from @xmath49 and @xmath50 is influenced by the epis .",
    "it is possible to observe an effective negative interdot coulomb interactions if we have strong epis and a large hopping matrix element of plasmon ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "for simplicity , this study is restricted in the case of @xmath51 and identical qds ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "to decuple the epis of @xmath47 , we take the mean - field average to remove the plasmon field arising from @xmath54 , that is @xmath55 .",
    "based on such a mean - field average , we see a reduction of @xmath56 and interdot hopping strength @xmath57 .",
    "this approximation is valid when the tunneling rate arising from the coupling between the qds and the electrodes is smaller than the epis,@xmath58 which is our condition of interest .",

    "in addition , the limitation of @xmath123 should be satisfied .",
    "bulk metals have very large plasmon frequencies , which can be ten times larger than the on - site coulomb interactions of qds .",
    "therefore , the effects of epis on the tunneling current were ignored in the previous studies.@xmath31 the plasmon frequency of metallic nanostructures is the same order of magnitude as the on - site coulomb interactions and the epis is strong.@xmath124 one can expect to observe the plasmon assisted tunneling processes in the tunneling current spectra . to reveal the effects of epis on the tunneling current spectra of qdms , we initially consider the case without epis .",
    "the tunneling current and differential conductance are plotted in fig .",
    "2 with @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 . there is a large voltage across the junction , therefore the shift of energy level @xmath26 arising from the applied bias is considered by @xmath128 .",
    "we have adopted @xmath129 based on the assumption that qds are located in the central position between two electrodes .",
    "the black lines show the typical staircase structure of the tunneling current and an oscillatory differential conductance with respect to the applied bias arising from the intradot coulomb interactions .",
    "these structures will be washed out with increasing temperature .",
    "we will focus on the transport behavior throughout at the low temperature of @xmath130 . in the presence of interdot coulomb interactions ( red lines ) ,",
    "new staircase structures appear in the tunneling current .",
    "five peaks in differential conductance labeled from @xmath131 to @xmath132 result from electrons of the left electrode through the resonant channels of @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 . in the presence of @xmath60 ( see the blue lines ) , each peaks ( @xmath138 and @xmath132 ) split into the bonding ( bd ) and antiboding ( abd ) states .",
    "such structures can be depicted by using a single molecule with @xmath139 and @xmath140 states filled with one , two , three and four electrons .",
    "the electron filling of such a qdm satisfies hund s rule .",
    "in addition , peaks @xmath141 and @xmath142 have extra peaks , which correspond to the spin singlet states ( two electrons and three electrons ) .",
    "for instance the two electron singlet state has a resonant pole @xmath143 resulting from the @xmath144 in eq .",
    "( 9 ) , which is different from the two electron triplet state with pole @xmath145 from the @xmath146 of eq .",
    "the differential conductance structure resulting from three electrons can also be analyzed from the @xmath147 and @xmath148 of eq .",
    "( 9 ) . on the basis of results in fig .",
    "2 , we find that the interdot coulomb interactions play an important role in distinguishing between the configurations of one electron , two electrons , three electrons and four electrons .",
    "many theoretical works have been devoted to investigate the tunneling current through parallel qds for the applications of quantum computing.@xmath149 nevertheless , there still lacks a comprehensive theory to reveal the spin states of parallel qds . the retarded green function of eq .",
    "( 9 ) provides a closed form expression to distinguish eight configurations in the parallel qds .",
    "figure 3 shows the tunneling current ( j ) and differential conductance ( dg ) for different strengths of epis at @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath117 , @xmath152 . with increasing the strength of epis",
    ", the energy levels of the qds , intradot coulomb interactions , and interdot coulomb interactions are renormalized by epis such as @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 .",
    "the current spectra and differential conductance change considerably .",
    "five peaks of dg labeled from @xmath131 to @xmath132 at g=0 are shifted to the low bias regime .",
    "the magnitude and width of these peaks become smaller and narrower with increasing @xmath156 .",
    "this is attributed to the current reduction factor of @xmath157 [ see eq .",
    "( 6 ) ] and reduction of the tunneling rates @xmath158 .",
    "in addition to these five peaks , there is a satellite peak labeled n=1 , which arises from one plasmon assisted tunneling process . for the blue line ,",
    "we see two one - plasmon assisted tunneling peaks corresponding to @xmath159 , and @xmath160 . as a consequence of the very low temperatures , the structures arising from @xmath161 , and @xmath162 , which are contributed from the first term of eq .",
    "( 5 ) , correspond to electrons of the qdm with energy levels @xmath163 and @xmath164 to have one plasmon emission process to escape out the qdm .",
    "this processes are obviously suppressed in the small bias regime resulting from small electron population of the qdm .    since we consider @xmath117 , the spin degree of freedom can not be resolved in fig . 3.@xmath5 to further understand the epis on the current spectra of qdms with finite @xmath60 , we plot the tunneling current ( j ) and differential conductance ( dg ) as a function of the applied bias for the case of @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 in fig .",
    "the first two peaks indicated by the black line for dg correspond to the bd and abd states .",
    "the following three peaks are similar to those indicated by the blue line in fig.2 .",
    "they result from the spin singlet and triplet states . for @xmath168 , these spin - dependent spectra of dg",
    "just shift to the low bias regimes , whereas the separation between the bd and abd peaks in the triplet state is not changed .",
    "the exchange energy of the singlet state @xmath169 is also invariant . for @xmath170 ,",
    "the tunneling currents are enhanced resulting from the absence of the interdot coulomb blockade .",
    "the spectra from the two particle states merge into that of one particle at @xmath170 . consequently",
    ", the spin - dependent spectra of dg is suppressed .",
    "in addition , we observe multiple plasmon assisted tunneling processes ( n=2 ) .",
    "in this study we analyzed the effects of homogenous epis on the tunneling current spectra of qdms in the absence of detected proteins . as a result of the renormalization of the energy levels of qds , intradot and interdot coulomb interactions , and the tunneling rates",
    ", there is a significant change in the tunneling current spectra for strong epis coupling . because of",
    "the hopping of plasmons between two metal nanostructures , the indirect interdot plasmon mediated electron electron coulomb interactions appear .",
    "we predict that the multiple plasmon assisted tunneling processes can be observed in the tunneling current spectra of metal core / shell semiconductor qds for strong epis . in the presence of detected proteins , which will glue to the qdms",
