    "the data have also been used widely to put constraints on different parametric forms of primordial spectrum , mostly motivated by inflation  @xcite . however , despite the strong theoretical appeal and simplicity of a featureless primordial spectrum , it is important to determine the shape of the primordial power spectrum directly from observations with minimal theoretical bias .",
    "many model independent searches have been made to look for features in the cmb primordial power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "accurate measurements of the angular power spectrum over a wide range of multipoles by wmap has opened up the possibility of deconvolving the primordial power spectrum for a given set of cosmological parameters  @xcite .",

    "the error - sensitive richardson - lucy ( rl ) method of deconvolution was shown to be a promising and effective method to recover the power spectrum of primordial perturbations from the cmb angular power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "we have improved the deconvolution method by factoring out the normalization factors from the iteratively recovered primordial spectrum , @xmath3 , in the algorithm to remove the artifacts that were present at the two ends of the recovered spectrum in our previous work(corrected by template subtraction ) . for a given set of cosmological parameters",
    ", this method obtains the primordial power spectrum that ` maximizes ' the likelihood to data .    in this paper",
    "we apply the method to the cmb anisotropy spectrum given by wmap 3 year data .",
    "we employ discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) for smoothing the raw recovered spectrum from the binned data . in this work we first present detailed results of an automated computation of the primordial power spectrum for @xmath6 distinct points in the cosmological parameter space for flat @xmath0cdm models using wmap 3 year data .",
    "each of these @xmath6 points in the parameter space has specific characteristics of interest .",
    "we also present the preliminary results of the cosmological parameter estimation optimized over the form of the primordial spectrum in a coarsely sampled volume of the parameter space . in this case , instead of simply computing the likelihood for a given model of initial power spectrum , one obtains the initial power spectrum that maximizes the likelihood at a point and assigns that likelihood to that point in the space of cosmological parameters .",
    "however our results for the cosmological parameter estimation , have a coarse resolution in spacing of the parameters and is also limited in volume of the parameter space covered . in principle",

    "the kernel @xmath4 is completely fixed by the cosmological parameters of the _ ` base ' _ cosmological model .",

    "[ rlerr ] the idea is to employ a ` convergence ' function to progressively weigh down the contribution to the correction @xmath28 from a multipole bin when @xmath29 iterate to a value close to @xmath26 within the error bar @xmath27 .",
    "this innovation significantly improves the wmap likelihood of the deconvolved spectrum .",
    "further improvement of the likelihood to the full @xmath2 data is obtained by a subsequent step of wavelet based smoothing described in the next section . in this paper",
    "we have also improved the irl method that we used in our previous paper to directly remove the artifacts at the two tails of the spectrum . compared to our earlier implementation",
    ", we have eliminated the need to subtract a known model from the recovered spectrum to remove the artifacts at the two ends of the spectrum .",
    "we have achieved this by a slight change in the normalization procedure in the method , that corrects for the effect of very low amplitude of @xmath4 at very small and very large @xmath11 . in the previous paper , the normalization factor @xmath30 ,",
    "was hidden in the finally deconvolved @xmath3 and it was factored out at the end of the process . as we are dealing with an iterative process , every small artifact will affect the higher iterations more strongly . to avoid this",
    ", we separate the normalization factor @xmath30 from the @xmath3 from the beginning .",
    "this small modification gives rise to a big improvement in the method where the final form of the recovered spectrum is free from the artifacts at the two ends .",
    "thus we do not need to use any template to remove these artifacts ( as in our previous paper  @xcite ) .",

    "wavelet transforms provide a powerful tool for the analysis of transient and non - stationary data and is particularly useful in picking out characteristic variations at different resolutions or scales .",
    "this linear transform separates a data set in the form of low - pass or average coefficients , which reflect the average behavior of the data , and wavelet or high - pass coefficients at different levels , which capture the variations at corresponding scales . as compared to fourier or window fourier transform ,",
    "wavelets allow optimal `` time - frequency '' localization in the real , as well as , fourier domain .",
    "the vocabulary of dwt stems from applications in one dimensional time - stream signal trains , but has found wide application in signal in other domains and dimensions . specifically in our case , the ` signal ' being transformed is the power spectrum , @xmath3 , a one dimensional function of wavenumber , @xmath11 .",
    "wavelets are an orthonormal basis of small waves , with their variations primarily concentrated in a finite region , which make them ideal for analyzing localized ` transient ' signals .",
    "wavelets can be continuous or discrete . in the latter case ,",
    "the basis elements are strictly finite in size , enabling them to achieve localization , while disentangling characteristic variations at different frequencies @xcite .",
    "this is the preliminary reason for us to employ discrete wavelets for our analysis . for more details about dwt and its theoretical basis ,",
    "see @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use dwt to smooth the raw recovered spectrum obtained from the deconvolution using binned cmb spectrum data .",
    "the raw deconvolved spectrum has spurious oscillations and features arising largely due to the @xmath11 space sampling and binning in @xmath12 space .",
    "the main goal is to reconstruct the primordial spectrum which lead to an angular power spectrum with a high likelihood to the entire @xmath2 data at each multipole including the covariance between them .",
    "the wmap likelihood of the @xmath2 suffers owing to the spurious oscillations in the spectra on scales smaller than @xmath31 multipole space bins .",
    "the wmap likelihood improves as the spectra , @xmath3 is smoothed .",
    "we use dwt to smooth the recovered spectrum so that wmap likelihood of the corresponding theoretical @xmath5 is maximized . strictly speaking ,",
    "the best likelihood obtained in our method is a lower bound leaving open a mathematical possibility of obtaining a superior likelihood at the given point of the cosmological parameter space with a different primordial power spectrum .",
    "although it is difficult to establish that the final result is the unique solution with maximum likelihood , but numerous variations we have explored does suggest that it is perhaps very close to the best possible result .",
    "so we can claim that the improved reconstructed likelihoods which we drove for different points in the parameter space by assuming a broken scale invariant form of the primordial spectrum , put an upper limits for the best possible results .    for our smoothing purpose ,",
    "we use dwt in a systematic way to separate the features of the raw recovered spectrum .",
    "we map the raw recovered spectrum which has 1400 discrete points to an array of @xmath32 points by padding at the two ends . by applying the discrete wavelet transform to the input file",
    ", we get corresponding @xmath32 wavelet coefficients .",
    "if we apply the inverse wavelet transform to whole set of derived wavelet coefficients , the orthonormality of the wavelet basis will lead back to the raw recovered spectrum .",
    "but if we exclude wavelet coefficients above a given level of resolution , then the inverse wavelet transform , leads to a smoothed power spectrum compared to raw deconvolved spectrum essentially filtering out spurious high resolution structures arising due to numerical effects   angular power spectrum , implying a finite resolution in multipole ( 2d wavenumber ) space .",
    "hence is clear from information theoretic / physical intuition that all structures in the ( 3-d ) power spectrum on scales smaller than the corresponding size of the wavenumber bin are bound to be spurious . ] .    at the first step , we use the original raw recovered spectrum to calculate the likelihood to the wmap-3 data .",
    "it is in fact the inverse wavelet transform of the whole wavelet coefficients which has @xmath33 coefficients .",
    "we call it the recovered spectrum at level 11 . in the next step",
    ", we cut half of the coefficients and we use only the first @xmath34 coefficients . the derived results ( recovered spectrum at level 10 )",
    "would be smoother than the original spectrum .",
    "we continue the procedure for all different levels ( n=2 to 11 ) , and at each level we calculate the likelihood of the recovered results .",
    "the recovered result at a level which gives the best likelihood would be our final result .",
    "using discrete wavelet transforms has this important advantage of being a well defined smoothing procedure that also retains identify localized features in p(k ) that contribute a significant improvement to the likelihood .",

    "recently few new methods of parameter estimation have been proposed which are claimed to be much faster than the usual methods of monte carlo markov chain or grid sampling .",
    "these new methods may be suitable for our purpose but they are still applicable for a one dimensional space and they need to be modified to be applied in our problem@xcite . though it is still difficult and beyond our abilities to do the cosmological parameter estimation in the whole parameter space and with a high resolution , still we can do it for a reasonably large contiguous volume of the parameter space . in this part",
    ", we present the results for the cosmological parameter estimation by fixing the value of @xmath116 ( which we have chosen throughout the paper ) and varying the values of @xmath117 , @xmath106 and @xmath118 in a large volume of the parameter space . in our analysis",
    "we use the following priors : @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "any of the given priors for @xmath117 , @xmath106 and @xmath118 has been divided by eight equally - spaced points whose combinations will generate our assumed initial sampling in the parameter space .",
    "@xmath56 is derived from the other parameters assuming a flat universe . our motivation to choose these wide priors are from the strong limits from other astronomical and cosmological observations .",
    "in figure [ fig_param ] we see the resultant @xmath123 ( in z axis and also in color indicated by the tool bar in the upper panel ) versus different values of hubble parameter ( x axis in both upper and lower panel ) and @xmath124 ( y axis in both upper and lower panel ) .",
    "the lower panel shows the relative values of the @xmath56 in our parameter space ( indicated by color in the lower panel ) .",
    "the best likelihood has been derived for @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 with @xmath129 with respect to the reference likelihood of model g. another point in the parameter space with @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , which is more compatible with the other cosmological observations , also has a very good optimized likelihood with @xmath134 with respect to the reference likelihood of model g , which is very close to our best result .    results also show that for a very wide range of @xmath56 , even when its density is close to zero , we can have a very good fit to the wmap 3 year data which is expected , as cmb data alone are not very much sensitive to the @xmath0 density .    due to computational limitations , we could not do a fine resolution cosmological parameter estimation .",
    "work is still in progress and results will be published as soon as we accomplish the computations with the wmap 5 year data .",
    "is shown ( in z axis and also in color indicated by the tool bar in the upper panel ) versus different values of hubble parameter ( x axis in both upper and lower panel ) and @xmath124 ( y axis in both upper and lower panel ) .",
    "the lower panel shows the relative values of the @xmath56 in our parameter space ( indicated by color in the lower panel ) .",
    "we have assumed here @xmath116 . ]",
    "we hope that this would provide a completely different perspective to cosmological parameter estimation unbiased by prejudices of the early universe .",
    "we present the reconstruction of an optimal primordial power spectrum for flat @xmath0cdm cosmological models for different sample points in the parameter space .    in section iv we have chosen these sample of points to be consistent with different independent cosmological observations , or consistent with special theoretical models .",
    "almost in all cases the recovered spectrums improves the resultant effective likelihood significantly in comparison with the best fit power law form of the primordial spectrum in the whole parameter space . in section",
    "v we generalized our study to a much bigger sample of points where we performed the cosmological parameter estimation in a large volume of the parameter space .",
    "there are some important conclusions that can be drawn from our results .",
    "though the published results from wmap team after release of wmap 3 year data suggests the lower value of matter density in comparison with the other cosmological observations like large scale structure observations from sdss , supernovae and detection of baryon acoustic peak oscillations , our analysis shows that by assuming a free form of the primordial spectrum , cmb data can be well fitted to the models with the higher value of matter density compatible with the other cosmological observations . our preliminary studies in the parameter space , show some evidence that by assuming the free form of the primordial spectrum models with higher value of matter density are better fitted to the wmap 3 year data than models with low value of matter density .",
    "another important result is that a standard cdm model of the universe , can also be very well fitted to the wmap 3 year data by assuming the free form of the primordial spectrum .",
    "in fact for a scdm model , we could get one of our best recovered results by improving the likelihood around @xmath135 with respect to the best result for the power law form of the spectrum in the whole parameter space(reference likelihood of model g ) .",
    "the features of the recovered results for all these points in the parameter space have something in common .",
    "they all show a sharp cut of around the horizon and some significant features after the horizon scale .",
    "it has been shown before by @xcite that the effect of these features around the horizon are very important in improving the likelihood .",
    "these results are in agreement with the results from our previous paper where we studied the wmap 1 data .    assuming a free form of the primordial spectrum , we derived the best likelihood for a @xmath0cdm model at @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 within the explored region with @xmath129 with respect to the reference likelihood of model g. another point in the parameter space with @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , which is more compatible with the other cosmological observations , also has a very good optimized likelihood with @xmath134 with respect to the reference likelihood of model g.    the differences between our results in parameter estimation and the results from wmap team assuming a power law form of the primordial spectrum motivates us to work towards precise cosmological parameter estimation allowing full freedom to the form of the primordial spectrum , with a higher resolution in the spacing of the parameters and also considering the whole parameter space .    in this work",
    ", we use the modestly determined quality of cmb polarization spectra from wmap ( te and ee ) simply as a consistency check .",
    "however , cmb polarization ( ee ) spectra from planck surveyor is expected to be good enough to allow us to extend our deconvolution method simultaneously to cmb temperature and polarization .",
