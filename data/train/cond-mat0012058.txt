    "omori discovered scaling in earthquakes in the frequency distribution of aftershocks over one hundred years ago when he proposed a formula to represent the decay of aftershock activity with time [ _ omori , _ 1894 ] .",
    "now , one hundred years later , it remains as one of the few well established empirical laws in seismology . as noted by _",
    "utsu _ [ 1995 ] , ` any theory for the origin of aftershocks must explain this law , which is unique for its power law dependence on time ' . the omori law ( as modified by _ utsu _ , 1961",
    ") ,    @xmath6    says that the number of aftershocks @xmath1 , measured at time @xmath2 after the time of the main shock , declines following a power law with an exponent @xmath3 around one ( @xmath7 , with a median of about 1.1 , [ _ utsu , _ 1995 ] ) , and @xmath8 being a proportionality constant . to avoid divergence at @xmath9 ,",
    "the omori law is usually written in the form    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is an additional ` small ' positive constant with dimensions of time ( between 0.01 and 1 days , with a median of 0.3 days , [ _ utsu , _ 1995 ] ) .",
    "the power law , scale - free behavior is maintained for @xmath12 , with a transition to @xmath13 for @xmath14 that accounts for incompleteness in the detection of low - magnitude aftershocks during the few hours after the mainshock ( e.g. [ _ utsu , _ 1995 , fig 2 ; _ gross and kisslinger _ 1994 ] . from eq.([eq4002 ] ) , the cumulative number of aftershocks , @xmath15 , occurred until time @xmath2 after the main shock , defined as @xmath16 , is @xmath17    the omori law has also been verified in laboratory - scale experiments in brittle rock deformation by measuring acoustic emission [ _ scholz , _ 1968a , b ; _ lockner and byerlee _ , 1977 ; _ hirata ,",
    "_ 1987 ; _ sammonds et al . , _ 1992 ; _ lockner , _ 1993 ] and in mine - induced seismicity [ _ talabi , _ 1997 ] , which represents an intermediate scale between lab experiments and natural aftershocks .",
    "the fulfilment of the omori law at the microscale ( @xmath18 m ) , mesoscale ( @xmath19 m ) and macroscale ( @xmath20 m ) , suggests that a universal process is behind the inelastic strain responsible for acoustic emission in the laboratory [ _ hirata , _ 1987 ] , induced microseismicity in mines [ _ gibowicz , _ 1997 ] and aftershock sequences in active tectonic faults [ _ utsu , _ 1995 ; _ gross and kisslinger _ 1994 ] .",
    "but , what is this mechanism ?",
    "static fatigue , also known as stress- , creep- , or delayed fracture is the basic way of time - dependent failure under a constant load of a broad variety of materials , including textile fibers [ _ coleman , _ 1957 ] , fiber composites [ _ phoenix , _ 1977 ] , wood [ _ garcimartn et al . , _ 1997 ] , microcrystals [ _ pauchard and meunier , _ 1993 ] , gels [ _ bonn et al . , _ 1998 ] , policrystalline ceramics [ _ jacobs and chen , _",
    "1994 ] , metals [ _ schleinkofer et al . , _ 1996 ] ,",
    "silicate glasses [ _ charles , _ 1958 ] , minerals [ _ scholz , _ 1968a ; _ barnett and kerrich , _ 1980 ] , and rocks [ _ atkinson , _ 1984 ] . in all these cases ,",
    "the signature of static fatigue is the observation of a failure strength that is a function of the load history of the material . for brittle materials , and from the point of view of fracture mechanics , time - dependent strength",
    "is commonly associated with _ kinetic fracture _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , with the propagation of cracks under a crack tip stress intensity factor below the modulus of cohesion of the material [ _ kostrov et al . ,",
    "this propagation is stable and quasi - static , and is referred to as subcritical crack growth , where ` quasi - static ' means at velocities much less than the sonic velocity of the medium [ _ das and scholz , _ 1991 ] .",
    "the presence of a chemically active fluid environment saturating the pore and crack space enhances this subcritical crack growth , a mechanism known as _ stress corrosion _ [ _ charles , _ 1958 ; _ wiederhorn , _ 1967 ] .",
    "there is ample evidence that geological materials under brittle conditions owe their time - dependent strength to the mechanism of subcritical crack growth assisted by stress corrosion [ _ atkinson , _ 1984 ; _ atkinson and meredith , _ 1987 ] .",
    "_ benioff _ [ 1951 ] presented the first detailed theory offering an explanation of the causes and characteristics of aftershock sequences in terms of identifiable mechanical properties . according to his theory ,",
    "aftershocks occur when there is a _ time - dependent _ recovery of stress following the main shock .",
    "the stress recovery was ascribed by benioff to a static fatigue of the rocks in the immediate area of the fault .    since this seminal paper , many laboratory and numerical experiments",
    "have confirmed the hypothesis that aftershocks are a process of relaxing stress concentrations produced by the dynamic rupture of the main shock , and that they are , therefore , an intrinsic time - dependent rheological effect . in this context , _ scholz _",
    "[ 1968b ] formulated the first time - dependent strength model of aftershocks .",
    "he suggested that a time - dependent strength of the rocks in the area of the main shock could be the cause of the aftershock sequences and invoked static fatigue due to local overloads to stresses much higher than their long - term strength as the main mechanism of aftershocks .",
    "based on _ scholz _ s [ 1968a ] laboratory experiments on static fatigue of quartz , _ das and scholz _ [ 1981 ] formulated a general model of aftershocks using elastic fracture mechanics and the concept of subcritical crack growth .",
    "they showed that this model is consistent with the decay rate of aftershocks as expressed by the omori law , and that it is able to reproduce many other characteristics of real aftershock sequences .",
    "more recent works and papers that stress the role of time - dependent strength in aftershock dynamics are : _ yamashita and knopoff _ [ 1987 ] , who assume that stress corrosion is the physical mechanism for the delayed fracture in aftershocks ; _ marcellini _ [ 1995 , 1997 ] , advocating static fatigue , together with stress inhomogeneities , as the cause of omori - law aftershock sequences ; and _ lee _ [ 1999 ] and _ lee and sornette _ [ 1999 ] , who constructed a fuse network model of aftershocks incorporating a time dependent strength compatible with the mechanism of subcritical crack growth .",
    "all these models of aftershocks also obey the omori law .    as mentioned above , the omori - law decay rate of aftershocks following a main shock is an almost universal characteristic of seismicity ( as compared to the more irregular patterns of premonitory activity as foreshocks or quiescence ) . but despite this universality , many real aftershock sequences display anomalies in the decay rate that depart from the simple omori - law behavior . among these anomalies we can cite [ _ utsu , _ 1995 ] : ( i ) cases in which seismic activity following the main shock can not be represented by a simple power law due to the mixing of different series of activity [ _ gross and kisslinger _ 1994 ] ; and ( ii ) cases where aftershocks decay , as a whole , according to the omori law , but depart temporarily from the formula due to abrupt changes in activity ( accelerations and/or quiescence ) .",
    "in this paper we are interested in aftershock series that do not rigorously follow the omori law and , in particular , in this second type of anomalies where sudden accelerations in the rate of aftershock activity are not directly linked to aftershocks of larger magnitude .",
    "this last case is the so - called epidemic - type aftershock sequence , etas , where each aftershock has its own sequence of aftershocks [ _ ogata , _ 1988 ] , and can be thought of as a fractal version of the simple omori relaxation formula .",
    "there are , however , some aftershock sequences where the changes in decay rate are _ independent _ of the magnitude of the aftershocks that provoke these changes in activity , and that can not be ascribed to the etas model .",
    "one of these aftershock sequences took place in the eastern pyrenees on february 18 , 1996 [ _ correig et al . , _ 1997 ] and in this paper we propose a simple stochastic model _  la _ dynamic fiber bundle model as a framework to interpret this class of aftershock sequences .",
    "on february 18 , 1996 , a local magnitude @xmath21 earthquake occurred in the eastern pyrenees , with epicentral location n42@xmath2247.71 , e2@xmath2232.30 and focal depth of 8 km [ _ rigo et al .",
    ", _ 1997 ; _ pauchet et al . , _ 1999 ] .",
    "the series of aftershocks that followed this event was recorded at the three - component continuous broadband seismic station at the tunel del cad , located at about 80 km sw of the epicentral area .",
    "altogether , the series consists of 337 events ( complete for a threshold magnitude of 1.9 ) , spanning 1846 hours ( 77 days ) from the time of the main shock , and with magnitudes ranging from 1.9 to 3.8 .",
    "figure [ fig : acum]a shows the cumulative series of aftershocks , along with the magnitude of the events .",
    "the sudden change in slope at about 300 hours is not due to incompleteness of the series , and from the point of view of the magnitude of the aftershocks , there is no specific characteristic , nor any relevant event , that justifies this sudden change in the event rate .",
    "because of this different behavior , we will restrict our attention to the series defined by the first 300 hours , with a total of 308 events , as displayed in figure [ fig : acum]b .",
    "the most striking feature of this series is the change in concavity of the cumulative curve not correlated to any significant event ( as would be the case from the point of view of an etas model ) , suggesting an increase in the rate of aftershocks production apparently not related to any relaxation process.if we try to fit by the maximum likelihood method the aftershock data in fig .",
    "[ fig : acum]b to eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we immediately appreciate that a unique fit to the whole range ( 0 - 300 hours ) is graphically worse than two independent fits to the ranges 0 - 100 hours and 140 - 300 hours .",
    "unfortunately , the parameter estimation for the 140 - 300 hours is not unique , in the sense that more than one set of parameter values return the same value of the likelihood function after maximization . after fixing the values of @xmath8 and @xmath11 ( to the values @xmath23 and @xmath24 obtained for the fit to the 0 - 100 hours interval ) , the 140 - 300 hours fit returns a unique value for the parameter @xmath25 , which is statistically different to the value @xmath26 obtained for the 0 - 100 hours interval .",
    "the error in both estimates is one standard deviation assuming a normal distribution for the variance .",
    "these values of @xmath3 are abnormally low ( 0.75 for the 0 - 100 hours interval , and 0.65 for the 140 - 300 hours interval ) .",
    "the fit and the value of @xmath3 do not improve if the magnitude threshold is increased [ _ correig et al . , _ 1997 ] .",
    "the interpretation of the omori law as a relaxation process suggests a way of separating the aftershocks in the series into two classes : class a for the events that follow a relaxation law and class b for those events that do not .",
    "the criterion to assign the events to classes a or b is the following : if the interval of time @xmath27 between events @xmath28 and @xmath29 is strictly larger than the interval of time @xmath30 between events @xmath29 and @xmath31 , the event @xmath28 belongs to class a ; otherwise it belongs to class b. events belonging to class a are termed _ leading aftershocks _ , and those belonging to class b , _ cascades_. figure [ fig : acum]c shows the aftershock sequence classified as leading events ( solid circles ) and cascades ( dots ) .",
    "note that a cascade is initiated by a leading aftershock and that this leading aftershock has no significative different magnitude .",
    "the fit of eq .",
    "( 3 ) to the series formed by the leading aftershocks is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cascades]a .",
    "the fit has improved significantly from the initial fit to the whole sequence , and the value obtained for the exponent is now @xmath32 , much more in agreement with the standard values for worldwide aftershock sequences .",
    "figure [ fig : cascades]b depicts the series of cascades , in which the first term of each cascade is a leading aftershock .",
    "two important features are readily visible from the figure : ( @xmath28 ) the cascades are in general well approximated by straight lines ; and ( @xmath33 ) their corresponding slopes decrease with time .",
    "a plot of the slope @xmath34 of the cascades against time @xmath2 ( figure [ fig : slopes ] ) shows the remarkable fact that there exists a power - law relationship of the form @xmath35 between them , with @xmath36 .",
    "the properties summarized in figs .  [ fig : acum ] through [ fig : slopes ] for the aftershock sequence of the eastern pyrenees can be described at first order with the modified omori law , eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . but",
    "at second order there are important non - random fluctuations about this law ( represented by the cascades ) that can not be fitted in detail with , nor accounted for , the omori law and its relaxation origin . in the next section",
    "we will construct a model to account for this second order deviations from the omori law , and for the omori law itself , of course .",
    "we want to stress here that the characteristics of the series of aftershocks from the february 18 , 1996 , pyrenees mainshock are by no means ` exceptional ' . on the contrary",
    ", they seem to be a rather general feature of aftershock series .",
    "the authors are currently analyzing various aftershock sequences ( greece , kobe , landers , northridge ) and have found a behavior very similar to that of the pyrenees aftershock sequence .",
    "results will be reported elsewhere .",
    "fiber - bundle models ( fbms ) are simple discrete stochastic fracture models amenable to either close analytical or fast numerical solution .",
    "these models arose in intimate connection with the strength of bundles of textile fibers [ _ daniels , _ 1945 ; _ coleman , _ 1957 ] .",
    "since daniels and coleman s seminal works there has been a long tradition in the use of these simple models to analyze failure of heterogeneous materials [ _ vazquez - prada et al .",
    "_ , 1999 and references therein ] .",
    "the dynamic version of the fbm simulates the failure of materials because of static fatigue or delayed rupture . in this version ,",
    "one considers : ( @xmath28 ) a discrete set of @xmath37 elements located on the sites of a @xmath38-dimensional lattice ; ( @xmath33 ) a probability distribution for the nominal lifetimes of individual elements ; and ( @xmath39 ) a load - transfer rule which determines how the load carried by a failed element is to be distributed among the surviving elements in the set .    as stated in ( @xmath33 ) , the nominal lifetimes ,",
    "@xmath40 of the individual elements supporting an initial stress @xmath41 , equal for all @xmath42 , are taken from a probability distribution of the type @xmath43 where @xmath44 are random numbers ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 is the so called hazard rate or breaking rule .",
    "the most accepted hazard rate is of the form @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 represent a hazard rate of reference and a stress of reference respectively , and @xmath50 is an exponent in the range @xmath51 .",
    "this function has been used to fit experimental results of time - to - failure on various materials [ _ coleman , _ 1957 ; _ phoenix , _ 1977 ] .",
    "besides , _ phoenix and tierney _ [ 1983 ] derived it from a kinetic theory of thermally activated atomic bond rupture [ _ zhurkov , _ 1965 ] , and showed that in many circumstances it is a better approximation than the exponential breaking rule , @xmath52 , also used in modeling time dependent fracture [ _ coleman , _ 1957 ] .",
    "equation  ( [ eq4015 ] ) has the same form as charles power - law to describe stress corrosion induced subcritical crack growth in geological materials [ _ atkinson , _ 1984 ] : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the crack velocity , @xmath55 the activation energy , @xmath56 the gas constant , @xmath57 the absolute temperature , @xmath58 the stress intensity factor for mode i fracture , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are constants .",
    "sometimes , @xmath60 is known as the stress corrosion index",
    ". nominal values at room temperature and in wet rock are [ _ atkinson and meredith , _ 1987 ] : 15 - 40 for quartz and quartz rocks ; 10 - 30 for calcite rocks ; 30 - 70 for granitic rocks ; and 25 - 50 for gabbro and basalt .",
    "if we assume constant temperature , eq .",
    "( [ eq40112 ] ) can be simplified to @xmath61 which is identical to eq .",

    "( [ eq4015 ] ) with the crack opening velocity expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq40113 ] ) .    in dynamic fbms ,",
    "once elements begin to fail because of fatigue and their stress is transferred according to the assumed rule , the stresses among the surviving elements are no longer equal and the stress history of an individual element becomes complicated by the successive step - like transfers coming from failing elements .",
    "the effect of the increase in stress for a particular element @xmath42 is the reduction of its lifetime from the initially assigned @xmath63 to a @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 notice that in the case of independent elements ( i.e. , no stress transfer ) , @xmath66 @xmath67 and hence the bundle would break as a succession of individual failures at the times @xmath63 assigned at the beginning .",
    "when , on the contrary , stress redistribution between elements is assumed , the temporal series of individual failures actually occurs at the times @xmath64 dictated by eq .",
    "( [ eq406 ] ) .",
    "note , that in these models , the total stress acting on the system is conserved until the failure of the last element ; and for the reasons explained above , the last element , i.e. , that with the longest @xmath64 , does not coincide , in general , with that with the longest @xmath63 .",
    "a detailed explanation of how to perform a monte carlo simulation using this model can be found in [ _ newman et al . , _",
    "1995 ] where the reader is referred to for details .",
    "the dynamic fbm can also be calculated using a probabilistic approach .",
    "this approach was introduced by us in _ gmez et al . , _ [ 1998 ] . from this perspective , one starts with @xmath37 elements loaded with an initial common stress equal to @xmath41 .",
    "the mean time interval , @xmath68 , for one element to break by fatigue is @xmath69 supposing that @xmath70 and @xmath71 in eq .",

    "this will change with time because of stress transfers . at any instant of the process of breaking , @xmath68 of eq .",
    "( [ eq4010 ] ) represents the mean time for the next individual failure .",
    "the identification of which element breaks after one @xmath68 is calculated by deciding that the probability that precisely element @xmath75 be the affected one is given by @xmath76    the reader will note that , from the probabilistic perspective , one does not consider weak elements and strong elements : here all elements are equal but , in general , with a different @xmath77 .",
    "the succession of individual breakings proceeds by chance with the probabilities dictated by eq .",
    "( [ eq4011 ] ) until the total collapse of the system . in _",
    "gmez et al .",
    ", _ [ 1998 ] it was shown that the probabilistic approach represents a way of partially smoothing the fluctuations inherent to these stochastic models of fracture .",
    "the model used in this paper to describe aftershock sequences is based on the same physical mechanism as the model recently introduced by _ lee _ [ 1999 ] and _ lee and sornette _ [ 1999 ] , although the ingredients of the cellular automaton , the way of running the model and the type of results are different .",
    "our model is inspired by dynamic fbms , but with several substantive differences .",
    "as stated above , in dynamic fbms @xmath37 uniformly loaded elements break by fatigue one after one , in a total stress conserving process until the last individual failure .",
    "the sequence always occurs in a finite - time accelerated process .    trying to describe a sequence of aftershocks , which is a clearly decelerated process of relaxation",
    ", we will modify three things : ( @xmath28 ) stress is lost in the breaking process in two ways , one is by stress transfers out of the system through the borders , and the other way is by considering a dissipative effect during each transfer .",
    "when an element fails bearing a stress @xmath62 , the fraction @xmath78 is removed from the system .",
    "thus , the constant @xmath79 will represent the degree of conservation .",
    "( @xmath33 ) in fbms , when an element fails , it transfers its load and then remains inactive . in this model , on the contrary , when an element fails , it transfers its load ( except the dissipated fraction ) to its nearest neighbors but then it is automatically regenerated and able to receive stress again and actively participate in the time evolution of the set .",
    "after its regeneration , an element has zero load before receiving any load .",
    "this assumption is justified because time intervals between individual failures are much longer than the time of actual breaking of an asperity , and hence in an interevent interval a just failed asperity has enough time to reheal .    the third difference ( @xmath39 ) with fbms",
    "is related to the initial stress distribution in the system .",
    "whilst in fbms it is usually assumed that the initial load per element is a constant @xmath41 , here , trying to simulate the disordered state existing in the fault after a main shock , we will take the initial @xmath77 from a uniform probability distribution ( @xmath80 ) . in the actual",
    "running of the model we will adhere to the probabilistic approach explained above for the fbm , and so we will deal with the @xmath68s as defined in eq.([eq4010 ] ) and the probabilities of eq .",
    "( [ eq4011 ] ) .    besides the three general modifications ( @xmath28 ) , ( @xmath33 ) , and ( @xmath39 ) introduced with respect to fbms , in order to reinforce the appearance of sudden accelerations , which constitute the genuine phenomenology of the complex aftershocks sequences , we will add two more rules for running our model .",
    "when a breaking is going to occur in a context such that all the elements have @xmath81 , we say that this is a _",
    "normal _ event , the @xmath68 is calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq4010 ] ) and the broken element is pointed out by using eq .",
    "( [ eq4011 ] ) . on the contrary",
    "if a breaking is going to occur with one or several elements with @xmath82 , we call it an _ avalanche _ step . for each avalanche step , _ a ) _ the @xmath68 is calculated using , as usual , eq .",
    "( [ eq4010 ] ) but the element that breaks is that one whose @xmath77 surpasses @xmath83 .",

    "these two additional rules _ a ) _ and _ b ) _ are introduced in order to increase the local stress accumulations .",
    "the high stress concentrations occurring in avalanche events lead to very short @xmath68s and in very short @xmath68s it is reasonable to assume that there is not enough time for the healing process .    as a rsum of the last paragraphs",
    ", we will recall that in the process of evolution of the system there are normal events and avalanche events .",
    "the former ( normal ) refers to the failure of one element when no element in the system has @xmath86 .",
    "the latter ( avalanche steps ) corresponds to the failure of one element with @xmath86 .",
    "( [ eq4010 ] ) is always used for the calculation of the time intervals .",
    "the @xmath68s of the avalanche steps are much shorter because of the large stress concentrations induced by rules _ a ) _ and _ b ) _ , and the magnitude of the exponent @xmath50 . with these rules , it is obvious that the avalanches become extinct with time because as the total stress in the system declines , it is more difficult to locally accumulate load to surpass unity .",
    "the model of _ lee _ [ 1999 ] and _ lee and sornette _ [ 1999 ] can not describe complex aftershock sequences because in their model the avalanches are instantaneous in time , so that the decay rate would have singularities at the time of an avalanche . on the contrary ,",
    "our avalanches are not instantaneous since they are formed by several steps with their corresponding @xmath68s , that is , they occur in a finite time interval .",
    "we have performed our simulations in a two dimensional square lattice with @xmath87 sites with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "each site represents the emplacement of one element or asperity .",
    "the load - transfer rule assumed is a local load - sharing ( lls ) rule : a failing element transfers its load to its nearest four neighbors located in the north , south , east and west .",
    "if the element is located at the borders of the square lattice this isotropic transfer provokes the corresponding stress leakage .    in fbms ,",
    "in which broken elements remain inactive , an lls rule can lead to an uncertain situation when a failing element lacks active neighbors able to receive the stress transfer . in this model , though , this does not occur because any element , at any time , is active to receive stress . the only possible exceptional situation could come from the application of rule _",
    "b ) _ in avalanches . then",
    ", the load of the failing element is transferred only to the existing active nearest neighbors . in this extremely rare case",
    "( we have not met such a situation in our simulations ) of having the four nearest neighbors already broken , the load is removed from the lattice .",
    "this is just one possibility among various choices .",
    "_ lomnitz - adler et al . _ [ 1992 ] explored in detail three of these possibilities for a cellular automaton with rules similar to those of the lls static fiber - bundle model , and the reader is referred to this paper for details . in our model",
    "deciding among one of the three alternative scenarios is not important due to the extreme rarity of such events .",
    "the running of the program proceeds as follows . at @xmath9",
    "all the elements on the lattice are initialized by loading them with a random initial stress @xmath77 taken from a uniform probability distribution @xmath90 .",
    "then , we calculate the @xmath68 corresponding to the first failure by using eq.([eq4010 ] ) .",
    "the choice of the element that actually breaks is done by using eq .",

    "now , we analyze the distribution of stress in the board ; if all the @xmath41 are lower than one , the process of calculating the next failure is identical to the first . if , on the contrary , one ( or several ) @xmath92 then we calculate the corresponding value of @xmath68 from eq.([eq4010 ] ) and the failure is assigned to the element with the biggest @xmath93 . during the period of an avalanche ,",
    "b ) _ is applied to favor the stress concentration .",
    "thus , the series of breakings and transfers , involving normal events or avalanches , proceeds until a prescribed minimum value for the total stress on the system is reached , otherwise there will be an infinite number of aftershocks .    in our model , due to the dissipation , the total stress in the system , @xmath94 , systematically decreases . if the value @xmath95 were considered , then from eq .",
    "( [ eq4010 ] ) , the successive @xmath68s would necessarily be longer and longer .",
    "but @xmath50 is bigger than one , and this is the reason why one can have a step down in @xmath96 and find a shorter value of @xmath68 .",
    "this is the key point to understand our model and other models based on subcritical crack growth . in the general trend of @xmath96 reduction and hence temporal deceleration , the stress transfers in the system",

    "these accelerations are embedded in the general trend of dynamical relaxation .",
    "we have carried out numerical simulations which show the fulfillment of omori s law and reproduce the features already commented on , that is , a cumulative plot with sudden variations in the number of events ( accelerations ) .",
    "we show here the results for a two - dimensional system of @xmath97 elements located on a square lattice , with @xmath50 equal to @xmath98 and a conservation level of @xmath89 .",
    "other simulations have also been performed varying the size of the system , the value of @xmath50 and the conservation level , @xmath79 .",
    "we have also explored a variant of rule @xmath99 in which , in avalanches , all the elements with @xmath82 break simultaneously in the same @xmath68 .",
    "we have found that the results are indeed very close to those exposed here with equal qualitative behavior . nevertheless , it should be noted that although the results are robust over a large range of parameters , different characteristics arise for extreme values of @xmath50 and @xmath79 .",
    "figure [ fig : mrate ] shows the rate of aftershocks @xmath100 as a function of time .",
    "time is represented in dimensionless units and it is the sum of the successive @xmath68s .",
    "the straight line has a slope of @xmath101 for comparison .",
    "thus , the @xmath102 decay is confirmed and is in full agreement with omori s law for real aftershock sequences .",
    "the power law depicted is very robust over a wide range of the parameters that characterize the model .",
    "the most critical parameter is the conservation level since for values of @xmath79 close to unity , the system does not dissipate enough to avoid its complete failure .",
    "besides , for large dissipation @xmath103 , the power law extends only to a few decades , and the number of decades decreases as @xmath79 decreases .",
    "anyhow , in all cases the exponent of the power law decay is very close to unity .",
    "the major vertical spikes of fig .",
    "[ fig : mrate ] correspond to avalanche - type events that disappear with time .",
    "the smaller fluctuations for large times reflect the intrinsic probabilistic nature of the model and are not related at all to the appearance of avalanches .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : macum ] where we have plotted the cumulative number of aftershocks versus time instead of the differential plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : mrate ] . as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : macum ] , sudden accelerations appear in the first stages of rupture .",
    "this behavior closely resembles that previously reported in sec . 2 for the eastern pyrenees aftershock sequence ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : acum ] ) .",
    "the omori s law maximum likelihood fit to the model results is also included in fig .  [",
    "fig : macum ] .",
    "the estimated parameter values are : @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .    in our model ,",
    "the changes in aftershock rate are related to the readjustments of local stresses when events take place . with time",
    ", local concentrations of stress appear in the system and there is a high probability of finding a region in which the load supported by the elements is close to the threshold value @xmath107 .",
    "that is , there is a large heterogeneous stress state in which one failure will trigger an avalanche . during the evolution of the avalanche the local accumulation of load increases .",
    "this fact together with the high value of @xmath50 , provokes the @xmath68s corresponding to these steps of rupture to be considerably reduced . as a result",
    ", we observe the step - like change in the cumulative number of events ( contrast fig.5 with fig.6 ) . for large times",
    "the avalanches eventually disappear since in a non - conservative model the total load in the system systematically decreases and hence it would be unlikely to accumulate stress in local regions as to surpass the value @xmath107 .    of interest",
    "is the further investigation of the acceleration events in order to get an additional insight about the observed aftershock sequences .",
    "one simple way to do that was explained in sec .",
    "it consists of decomposing the original series of aftershocks in leading events and cascades depending on whether a relaxation law is accomplished or not .",
    "we have followed the same procedure with the synthetic data .",
    "the series of cascades obtained in such a way is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcascades ] .",
    "part ( a ) shows the series after removing all the cascades , i.e. , leaving only leading aftershocks , and in fig .  [",
    "fig : mcascades]b we plot the cascades , in which the first event of each cascade is a leading aftershock .",
    "the decomposition obtained from the model is indeed indistinguishable from that corresponding to the real series of events ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cascades ] ) .",
    "two characteristics of the series of cascades are again relevant : one , the elapsed time between successive leading events is larger than the preceding one in complete agreement with the supposition of a relaxation process , and second , the series of cascades can be well approximated by almost straight segments whose slopes decrease as time passes .",
    "this later characteristic could be used to quantify the observed jumps in the cumulative plot of aftershocks and to explain why they are present mainly in the first stages of rupture .",
    "the larger jumps are related to the occurrence of avalanches , which are caused by local accumulations of stress ; so it is expected that when avalanches damp out due to dissipation , changes in the rate of occurrence are more spaced in time and cascades consist of fewer events .",
    "of course , there will be fluctuations about the power law trend even in the case where avalanches have deceased .",
    "thus , we expect slope values gradually closer to zero as time tends to infinity .",
    "this is clearly appreciated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mslopes ] , where we have represented in a log - log plot the slopes of the cascades versus the occurrence time of the leading event that initiate each cascade .",
    "plot ( a ) shows only the first part of the time sequence to facilitate comparison with fig .  [",
    "fig : slopes ] . as for the observed series of aftershocks ,",
    "the slopes fit a power law with an exponent of about @xmath108 for the fist part of the time series and @xmath109 for the long - tail end ( plot ( b ) ) .",
    "actually , the long - tail exponent @xmath110 ranges between @xmath111 and @xmath112 depending on the conservation level @xmath79 and the value of @xmath50 .",
    "this appears to be a smooth dependence .",
    "thus , the qualitative behavior is again captured . the discrepancy between the slopes ( @xmath113 for the pyrenees sequence )",
    "is not surprising due to the simplicity of the model as compared with the inherent complexity of the real phenomenon we want to simulate .",
    "the reason for this particular behavior , that is , why the slopes follow a power law and no other law , is unclear to us up to now .",
    "future efforts will be devoted to the understanding of other dynamical characteristics of the model and their fine dependence on @xmath50 and @xmath79 by studying another complex series of aftershocks .",
    "we also plan to perform a detailed analysis of the spatial structure of the sequence of events coming from our model .",
