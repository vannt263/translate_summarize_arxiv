    "if neutrinos carry magnetic or electric dipole or transition moments , they can spin - precess into other spin and/or flavour states in the presence of external magnetic fields .",
    "for example , if neutrinos were dirac particles with a magnetic dipole moment @xmath1 , the active left - handed states could spin - precess into the otherwise sterile right - handed ones .",
    "it has been speculated that this effect can explain the deficiency of the measured solar neutrino fluxes , and it certainly can be important for supernova physics where large magnetic fields are known to exist @xcite .",
    "further , it has been recognized for a long time that primordial magnetic fields of sufficient strength would couple right - handed dirac neutrinos to the cosmic thermal heat bath and thus cause these `` wrong - helicity '' states to be thermally populated @xcite .",
    "this effect would enhance the expansion rate of the universe at the epoch of nucleosynthesis and thus modify the standard scenario of the formation of the light elements , in potential disagreement with the observationally inferred abundances .",
    "the original discussions of this cosmological effect @xcite did not take into account neutrino dispersion , which at that time had received only marginal attention . later on , it became clear that even though the neutrino dispersion relations in vacuum and in media are very close to that of massless particles , any deviation from the latter may cause significant modifications of spin or flavour - oscillation processes . a first assessment of medium - induced dispersion effects for early - universe magnetic spin oscillations was provided in ref .",
    "in addition , however , one has to worry about neutrino collisions during the oscillation process . a formalism for the simultaneous treatment of oscillations and collisions",
    "was pioneered in refs .",
    "@xcite , and was refined in terms of quantum - kinetic equations in refs .",
    "a quantum - kinetic treatment of the early - universe magnetic oscillation problem was provided in a recent series of papers @xcite .",
    "because even fine points of the neutrino dispersion relation are important for oscillation phenomena , one naturally wonders if the assumed presence of a strong magnetic field may cause a spin polarization of the electrons and positron in the medium , which in turn may act as a new contribution to the dispersion relation .",
    "semikoz and valle @xcite claim that this is the case even for zero chemical potential , and that this effect dominates the neutrino dispersion relation for the physical conditions relevant in the early universe . upon closer inspection , however , we find that this dispersion relation is based on an unfortunate sign error . in a charge - symmetric plasma",
    ", the magnetization part of the local self - energy terms cancels between electrons and positrons rather than adding , as claimed by semikoz and valle @xcite . while the correct sign can be understood by a simple physical argument ( sect .",

    "[ sss : cpt ] ) , we take this opportunity to provide the neutrino dispersion relation in a magnetized medium for arbitrary electron chemical potential and magnetic field strength .",
    "the correct sign is then a consequence of our completely general and formal derivation , which leaves no room for ambiguities .",
    "our general expressions may also be of interest in the context of neutrino spin oscillations in supernovae , where strong fields and very degenerate electrons occur .",
    "surprisingly , we find that even for arbitrary field strengths our expressions are very similar to those derived by dolivo , nieves , and pal @xcite in the weak - field limit .",
    "neutrino dispersion in a magnetized medium may be viewed from a somewhat different perspective where one considers an effective neutrino electromagnetic form factor , or vertex function , induced by the presence of the medium @xcite .",
    "various components of this vertex function , which is a lorentz tensor , may be interpreted as certain effective neutrino electromagnetic multipole moments . in this language ,",
    "neutrino dispersion in a magnetized medium is represented by a medium - induced effective neutrino magnetic dipole moment , which naturally leads to an energy shift in the presence of a magnetic field .-",

    "in order to derive a general expression for the neutrino dispersion relation in a magnetized medium we observe that , to lowest order , the self - energy is given by the tadpole and bubble diagrams shown in fig .",

    "we use the notation @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "further , @xmath12 is the @xmath13-boson propagator while @xmath14 is the coordinate - space propagator for the background fermion . for a charged dirac spin-@xmath15 particle in the presence of an external magnetic field",

    "our prime example is electrons for which the weak coupling constants are @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the bubble diagram contributes only for a background of charged leptons from the same family as the test neutrino . in our specific case of a test @xmath19 in the presence of an @xmath20 plasma , we find [ sigbub ] -i_bubble= ( ) ^2 r^is(p ) id^w_(k - p)^l  . for a neutrino background from the same family as the test neutrino",
    ", there is a similar diagram with a @xmath13@xmath21-loop that can be obtained by replacing @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the tadpole diagram provides only a local contribution , i.e.  the gauge - boson propagator is taken at the energy - momentum transfer @xmath24 so that we could have used an effective low - energy four - fermion interaction .",
    "the bubble diagram , however , involves the gauge - boson propagator at a non - vanishing @xmath25 so that there is a non - local term in the self - energy . even in extreme astrophysical sites , such as neutron stars ,",
    "the relevant energies are so low , and the chemical potential so high relative to the temperature , that the bubble diagram is dominated by the local term . however , the local term vanishes identically in a charge - symmetric plasma .",
    "therefore , in the early universe the neutrino self - energy is dominated by the non - local part of the bubble diagram @xcite .        in order to derive the electron - neutrino dispersion relation in a magnetized medium explicitly , we begin with the local contributions . to this end",
    "we expand the gauge - boson propagators in powers of the energy - momentum transfer @xmath25 , [ gbprop ] d^w , z_()=+ + o",
    "( )  . the first term , which is the only one contributing to the tadpole , gives the local part of the self - energy .    using the charged - fermion propagator in an external magnetic field ( see appendix  [ a : loop ] for more details ) , the tadpole yields for a plasma consisting of electrons , neutrinos , and nucleons : [ tadfin ] _ tadpole&=&\\ { _ 0 & & 21em + n^0_e-|e}l  , where @xmath26 is a unit vector in the external @xmath27-field direction .",
    "further , @xmath28 denotes the net number density of fermions @xmath29 , i.e.  the total number density of fermions @xmath29 minus that of antifermions @xmath30 . for neutrinos ,",
    "only the number density of left - handed states ( superscript @xmath31 ) is counted , which is identical to the total number density unless the right - handed degrees of freedom have been populated by , say , magnetically induced spin oscillations .",
    "usually , the standard electron and proton terms cancel against each other in a charge - neutral plasma where @xmath32 .    in the magnetic tadpole term",
    ", @xmath33 is the net number density of electrons in the lowest landau level .",
    "of course , the exact cancellation of all higher landau levels applies only to dirac fermions which do not carry anomalous magnetic dipole moments .",
    "this approximation is not justified for nucleons , which carry large anomalous magnetic moments so that their polarization does not cancel between the higher landau levels which are not degenerate . however , unless the field is extremely strong or the temperature much higher than the nucleon masses , the nucleon magnetization is suppressed by their heavier masses relative to electrons . because in the present paper we are primarily interested in early - universe physics between the qcd phase transition and big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , nucleons can certainly be ignored with regard to neutrino dispersion effects .",
    "in addition we need to consider the bubble diagram , which yields a local contribution from electrons and electron neutrinos of [ locbubfin ] _",
    "bubble=2l  .",
    "nucleons never contribute to this term .    in the weak - field limit our results agree with those found in ref .",
    "@xcite , except for the overall sign which is related to the convention in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath34 for electrons .",
    "the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite was strictly perturbative in that a plane - wave basis for the fermions was used instead of landau levels .",
    "we stress that exact expressions for quantities such as the magnetization or the magnetic susceptibility do not in general admit a power - series expansion in @xmath27 , forcing one to use landau levels as external states @xcite . however , when a quantity does admit a power series expansion , it is not too surprising that the linear term of the exact result agrees with a perturbative calculation based on plane - wave states .",
    "our magnetic neutrino self - energy terms apply for @xmath35 , but @xmath27 may well be large compared with other scales in the problem , such as the electron mass or the temperature . even for such large fields",
    "the linear term actually gives the complete result .",
    "this surprising finding is traced to the fact that only the lowest landau level contributes and that @xmath33 is strictly linear in @xmath27 .",
    "it must be noted , however , that the presence of the field affects the phase - space distribution of the charged fermions and thus the relationship between chemical potential and density .",
    "therefore , one must specify if the charged - particle densities or their chemical potentials are held fixed in order to specify the functional dependence of the neutrino dispersion relation on @xmath27 .",
    "the dispersion relation for left - handed electron neutrinos in a magnetized plasma is obtained by taking the determinant of @xmath36 .",
    "we find [ dr ] e_=k_0=a+|-|  , where @xmath37 refers to @xmath19 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "further , [ aandb ] & = & -n_n-|n+ _ i = e , , n^l__i-|_i + n^l__e-|_e + n_e-|e & & -(-2 ^ 2_w)(n_e-|e - n_p-|p )  , & = & n^0_e-|e  .",
    "it is the medium- and field - induced breaking of lorentz invariance that generates a non - trivial dispersion relation , or refractive index , for neutrino propagation . in a charge - neutral plasma the term proportional to @xmath39 vanishes .",
    "again , there is a small nucleon contribution to @xmath40 which we have neglected .",
    "we stress that it is a slight abuse of language to call @xmath40 magnetization because only the spin part of the magnetization enters , not the orbital part .",
    "note further that the spin is not a conserved quantity and only the lowest landau level is a spin eigenstate .",
    "because the local magnetization contribution to the refractive index is controversial in the literature , it is useful to provide a more physical derivation where the absolute sign , and the relative sign between the electron and positron terms , become more directly apparent . to this end",
    "we may start directly from the four - fermion neutrino vertex with a charged lepton @xmath41 : [ hamiltonian ] h_int = g_f _ _ l _ _ ^(g_v - g_a_5 ) _  . here , the effective weak neutral - current coupling constants @xmath42 are identical with @xmath43 unless @xmath41 is from the same family as the neutrino , in which case @xmath44 because the fierz - transformed charged - current mimics a neutral - current interaction .",
    "the neutrino self - energy is found by calculating the expectation value @xmath45 in a background bath of fermions @xmath41 . in an unpolarized , isotropic medium",
    "only the zeroth component of the vector current contributes and yields the standard result .",
    "a magnetically induced polarization of the charged background fermions , however , causes the axial current to obtain a non - vanishing expectation value .    for ultrarelativistic charged fermions the expectation value of the chirality operator @xmath46 is identical with that of @xmath47 , an observation that establishes a simple relation between chirality and the magnetic quantum number @xmath48 of the landau levels .",
    "it implies that the axial - vector contributions cancel between charged fermions with the same momentum but opposite @xmath48 .",
    "the landau - level energies @xmath49 , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , are degenerate between the levels @xmath52 and @xmath53 except for the lowest level @xmath54 , which is not matched by a lower level with opposite magnetic quantum number .",
    "therefore , only the lowest landau level contributes to the expectation value of the axial - vector current .    a negatively charged ultrarelativistic @xmath41 in the lowest landau level , moving along the @xmath27-field , has its magnetic moment parallel to @xmath55 , a spin opposite to @xmath55 , and therefore negative chirality .",
    "hence for such a state [ expectationvalue ] _ ( g_v - g_a_5 ) _",
    "= _ _ ( g_v+g_a ) = ( g_v+g_a )  .",
    "if @xmath41 moves in the opposite direction we get @xmath56 so that the vector part averages to zero for each momentum mode separately if the phase - space distribution is reflection - symmetric along @xmath55 .",
    "an anti-@xmath41 ( @xmath57 ) moving along the @xmath27-field has its magnetic moment also pointing parallel to @xmath55 , but its spin in the opposite direction relative to an @xmath41 with the same momentum along the field , since the charge is opposite .",
    "therefore , the helicity of @xmath57 is opposite to that of @xmath41 and thus their chiralities are equal .",
    "the expectation value corresponding to is then @xmath58 .",
    "similarly we get @xmath59 for an @xmath57 moving in the opposite direction . multiplying with the net number density of @xmath41 s and @xmath57 s in the lowest landau level",
    "we obtain [ snu ] _ = -g_a g_f n^0_-|l  , where the final minus sign comes from the contraction of space - like indices in .",
    "while our simple derivation was based on the notion of ultrarelativistic charged leptons , this result holds true even for non - relativistic ones as follows from the formal derivation in the previous section .",
    "the absolute sign of the energy shift , which differs from the one found in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be checked by comparing with .",
    "if the leptons are of a family opther than the neutrinos , @xmath60 , and one must compare with the tadpole term alone .",
    "for leptons of the same family , @xmath44 , and the sum of the bubble and the tadpole diagram should be compared to .",
    "the relative sign between the electron and positron terms also follows directly from this simple derivation without ambiguity .    in the early universe ,",
    "the numbers of particles and antiparticles are believed to be identical to within about @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the plasma was effectively charge - symmetric .",
    "our general results , , reveal that , to leading order in @xmath62 , there is no magnetization contribution to the neutrino refractive index in such an environment , contrary to what has been claimed by semikoz and valle @xcite who found that the fermion and antifermion terms in add rather than subtract .",
    "it is correct as in eq .",

    "( 3.3 ) to ( 3.6 ) semikoz and valle have unfortunately picked up an incorrect minus sign .",
    "therefore , at epochs before nucleosynthesis the non - local neutrino refractive terms remain more significant than the local ones @xcite , even in the presence of strong magnetic fields .",
    "the vanishing of the local contribution to the neutrino self - energy in a cp - symmetric plasma can also be deduced from a direct symmetry argument .",
    "to this end we assume that the background plasma is cp symmetric , and in addition we assume that it is in a stationary state so that it is also symmetric under the time - reversal operation t. since cpt is strictly conserved in our theory , and the magnetic field is cpt invariant , it follows that neutrinos and antineutrinos of a given momentum must experience the same medium - induced energy shift , i.e.  their self - energy in the medium must be the same .",
    "put another way , the expectation value of @xmath64 must be the same for neutrino and antineutrino states of equal momenta .    at one - loop level ,",

    "however , the four - vectors @xmath67 and @xmath78 are invariant under cpt .",
    "it is important to observe here that @xmath67 is not an operator for @xmath79 since it is just fixing the new reference frame . from it",
    "is clear that the local contribution to @xmath65 is independent of @xmath66 so that the coefficient @xmath69 must be zero while @xmath70 and @xmath71 must be constants .",
    "however , because @xmath80 and @xmath81 are even under cpt while @xmath82 is odd , and because @xmath83 is required to be even , we find that @xmath70 and @xmath71 must be zero .",
    "the coefficient @xmath71 is related to a medium - induced effective neutrino magnetic dipole moment . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was already shown on the basis of the same argument that such a dipole moment must vanish .",
    "thanks to this argument no contributions to @xmath84 can arise from strong - field corrections to the @xmath85 propagator in a cpt symmetric plasma .",
    "non - local terms which are odd functions of scalars that are odd under cpt , namely @xmath86 and @xmath74 , are not required to vanish .      in a charge - symmetric plasma ,",
    "all of the local self - energy terms given in vanish so that the second term in the expansion of the gauge - boson propagator in dominates .",
    "we shall concentrate on the case where @xmath87 and @xmath0 . in the early universe ,",
