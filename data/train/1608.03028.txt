    "the @xmath2 light hybrid mesons have attracted particular attention in hadronic physics .",
    "the reason is not only such a state can be distinguished from ordinary @xmath7 mesons for its beyond - quark - model exotic quantum number but also it is expected to be one of the lowest - lying hybrid states . to date",
    ", accumulated experimental data have shown the existence of @xmath2 isovector states , i.e. @xmath8 , identified in @xmath9 and @xmath10 channels and @xmath11 seen to decay into @xmath1 , @xmath12 and @xmath10 decay mode : ves and compass have not claimed the existence of the @xmath0 decay while some people have argued that the phase motion results observed by e852 can be resulted from the leakage of @xmath13 @xcite . ]",
    "moreover , there is another @xmath2 state , @xmath14 , quoted in the extended version of pdg @xcite , which is only observed by e852 in @xmath12 and @xmath1 final states and needs further confirmation .",
    "computations on the light hybrid spectrum have been conducted with lattice qcd and different phenomenological models ( for a review , see @xcite ) . in the bag model ,",
    "the predicted mass of the low lying @xmath2 hybrid nonet is around 1.5gev @xcite .",
    "the earliest quenched lattice calculations predicted the @xmath2 light hybrid mass lies in the region 1.82.1gev @xcite , while the more recent dynamical calculations predicted the mass is around 2.2gev @xcite .",
    "isgur and paton estimated in the flux tube model the @xmath2 light hybrid mass to be 1.9gev @xcite while in the constituent gluon models , the exotic light hybrid mass are found to lie in the region 1.82.2gev @xcite .    in the framework of qcd sum rules",
    "@xcite , the earliest leading - order results obtained by different authors show the @xmath2 light hybrid mass lies in the range 1.62.1gev @xcite . over the past 15 years",
    ", different groups extended and improved the sum rule calculation .",
    "the radiative corrections were calculated in @xcite and @xcite for the perturbative terms and in @xcite for the ope . the short distance tachyonic gluon mass effects were also included in @xcite , and narison gave a systematical re - examination of the @xmath2 mass with inclusion of all the previous calculated effects and estimated the mass to be 1.81gev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the authors of this paper further complemented the sum rule analysis of the @xmath2 mass : instanton effects were studied in zhang s phd thesis @xcite , and a monte - carlo based uncertainty analysis was performed in @xcite . both of these efforts show little change in the mass prediction .",
    "moreover , recently we included the higher power corrections of ope with consideration of operator renormalization @xcite .",
    "we considered violation of factorization of higher dimensional condensates and updated the qcd input parameters .",
    "we obtained a quite conservative range of the @xmath2 light hybrid mass , i.e. 1.722.60gev , which only covers @xmath14 and does not support @xmath15 as a pure hybrid . given that the analysis in @xcite has involved all effects that seem to have considerable influence in the sum rule mass extraction",
    ", the mass range can be considered as a general conclusion from qcd sum rules .    from the theoretical mass predictions",
    "we can see that @xmath16 is not supported to be a hybrid by various theoretical schemes .",
    "even the mass of @xmath15 is lower than many of the theoretical predictions , although this resonance has long been considered as a good hybrid candidate .",
    "some people have argued that @xmath15 can involve a four - quark state , and a mixing of molecular state and four - quark state has been proposed in @xcite based on the discussions in @xcite and @xcite about @xmath2 tetraquark and molecular states .",
    "the unconfirmed @xmath14 has been suggested in @xcite and @xcite to be a good hybrid candidate . to shed further light on the nature of these states",
    "needs both theoretical and experimental study of the @xmath2 decay modes .",
    "the ukqcd collaboration examined the decay of @xmath2 hybrid with two dynamical quarks in the lattice simulation , and obtained the partial decay widths @xmath17mev and @xmath18mev @xcite .",
    "later in @xcite , burns and close found these results agree quite well with the predictions near threshold in the flux tube model , thus they reduced the partial widths to @xmath19mev and @xmath20mev , whereas the results in ikp model @xcite and pss model @xcite are @xmath21mev , @xmath22mev and @xmath23mev , @xmath24mev respectively .",
    "the decay modes of the @xmath2 light hybrid state have also been studied within the framework of qcd sum rules .",
    "the earliest three - point function sum rule studies can be seen in @xcite and @xcite , while a recent study can be seen in @xcite where the pion mass terms in the denominator were ignored and only the @xmath25 terms divergent in the limit @xmath26 were kept .",
    "the authors in @xcite also studied the @xmath2 decay @xcite using the light - cone qcd sum rules ( lcsr ) @xcite , of which the basic idea is to expand the correlation function near the light cone .",
    "however , the predicted partial decay width of @xmath27 is somewhat confusing .",
    "the suggestion of very tiny decay width of @xmath1 implies both @xmath15 and @xmath14 may not have much of a hybrid constituent , and also does nt agree with the predictions from various models mentioned above .",
    "considering the important role of @xmath1 decay mode in identifying the @xmath2 hybrid state , it s worthwhile to re - examine this decay mode within the same theoretical framework .    in this work ,",
    "we study the @xmath1 decay mode using the @xmath28 derivative current @xmath4 instead of the current @xmath29 adopted in @xcite .",
    "we also use the tensor current @xmath3 , which not only couples to @xmath28 but also the @xmath30 @xmath31 meson , thus an analysis of the @xmath0 decay mode can be provided simultaneously .",
    "usually , the @xmath31 meson is studied using the simpler vector interpolating current @xmath32 , as was done in @xcite for the mass and in @xcite for the decay constant .",
    "in addition , attempts to study the @xmath31 meson using the tensor current have also been made previously in both sum rule @xcite and lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "studies using the tensor current can provide a useful re - examine of the results obtained by using the vector current .",
    "previous sum rule studies using the vector current @xmath32 predict large partial decay width of @xmath0 channel @xcite while this channel is forbidden in the original flux tube model @xcite and the partial decay width is still small in its modified versions @xcite , therefore , it is also worth re - examining this channel by using the tensor current .",
    "we arrange the article as follows : in sec .",
    "[ lcqsr ] we illustrate the formalism of the light - cone qcd sum rules for deriving the coupling constants in the @xmath2 decay amplitudes . in sec .",
    "[ lcexpansion ] we present our results of the light - cone expansion of the correlation function of both the tensor current @xmath3 and the derivative current @xmath4 . in sec .",
    "[ integral ] we illustrate the method of calculating the integrals of the spectral densities , from which the contribution from excited states and continuum can be subtracted . in sec .  [ numerical ] , we present the numerical analysis of @xmath1 and @xmath0 decay modes with both currents . in sec .",
    "[ summary ] we present the summary and conclusions .",
    "we begin with the following correlation function to study the decay modes @xmath27 and @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the momentum for @xmath38 , @xmath28 or @xmath31 and @xmath39 , which satisfy the four - momentum conservation @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 couples to the @xmath2 light hybrid , @xmath42 couples to @xmath28 and @xmath31 , and @xmath43 also couples to @xmath28 .",
    "in the practical calculation , we use @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 to study the partial decay widths of decay modes @xmath47 and @xmath48 , of which the results also hold for @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we define the decay constants through the following formulas : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are polarization vectors , and the decay amplitudes can be written as : @xmath54    the correlation function can be expanded in the light - cone distribution amplitudes which play the similar role as the condensates of local operators in the svz operator product expansion .",
    "the light - cone expansions can be compared to the phenomenological expressions of the correlation function so as to estimate the coupling constants in and then to obtain the partial decay widths .",
    "after interpolating the intermediate hadronic states into and using the definitions in and , we arrive at the phenomenological sides : @xmath55+\\cdots,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath56 @xmath57+\\cdots,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the ellipses denote the contribution from excited states and continuum .    on the qcd side , the correlation function can be expanded near the light - cone @xmath58 in terms of meson distribution amplitudes of different twists . after picking out characteristic tensor structures we get invariant parts of correlation functions corresponding to different coupling constants in .",
    "sometimes this process involves some technical complications as different tensor structures entangle with each other at first sight .",
    "we will discuss these details in the next section .    in order to subtract the contribution from excited states and continuum in the invariants of correlation functions ,",
    "the double dispersion relation can be used : @xmath59 where the subtractions eliminate the infinities from the dispersion integral . after taking borel transformation , which is defined as @xmath60 = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{(-k^2)^{n+1}}{n!}\\left(\\frac{d}{dk^2}\\right)^nf(k^2)\\left|_{k^2=-nm^2}\\right.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the subtraction terms can be removed and then we get @xmath61 from which we can subtract continuum by cutting the integral at continuum thresholds @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the spectral density @xmath64 can be obtained by taking another double borel transformations on : @xmath65 after invoking the double borel transformations to the phenomenological representations , and , and compare them with the qcd side using , we get the master equations of light - cone qcd sum rules : @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 where contributions from excited states and continuum have been subtracted from both phenomenological and qcd sides .",
    "we expand the correlation function near the light - cone in distribution amplitudes calculated in @xcite .",
    "contributions of different decay modes mix in the final results . depending on the certain current used in the correlation function ,",
    "it is sometimes not quite straightforward to pick out the particular tensor structures corresponding to certain decay modes , which in our case holds for the tensor current . before presenting our results of light - cone expansion ,",
    "we show how to separate the tensor structures in the light - cone expansion of correlation functions .    for the tensor current correlation function ,",
    "the tensors that appear in the final results involve levi - civita tensors .",
    "generally we can form six tensor structures with a levi - civita tensor and two independent momentums with three independent lorentz indices @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 are anti - symmetric ) .",
    "they are @xmath74 actually , only four of the above tensors are independent",
    ". one can prove the formula below : @xmath75 by exchanging @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we get @xmath76 by using and , @xmath77 and @xmath78 that appear in the final results of the light - cone expansion can be expressed in terms of @xmath79@xmath80 . on the phenomenological side of correlation function of the tensor current , tensor structures corresponding to different decay modes are as below : @xmath81    from we can see that @xmath79 , @xmath82 and @xmath80 are the characteristic tensors for @xmath1 and @xmath0 decay modes , of which the corresponding terms on the qcd side can be extracted to compare with the phenomenological side . after doing this , we obtain the qcd side of the tensor current correlation function with light - cone expansion .",
    "the tensor structure for the correlation function of the derivative current are much simpler , we can see from that @xmath83 and @xmath84 can be the characteristic tensors ( the @xmath85 decay mode has a tensor structure parallel to @xmath86 due to @xmath87 )",

    "this discrepancy is mainly due to our addition of the das ( distribution amplitudes ) contribution from the covariant derivative of the current @xmath4 .",

    "we use both the tensor current @xmath3 and the derivative current @xmath4 as interpolating currents in our calculation .    for the @xmath1 decay mode , we find consistent numerical results ( within the errors ) of the coupling constants from the sum rules with different interpolating currents .",

    "these results support the hybrid explanations for @xmath15 and @xmath14 , both of which have been observed in the @xmath1 channels .    for the @xmath0 decay mode",
    ", we have obtained tiny values of the decay widths , which is quite different from the sum rules obtained by using the vector current @xmath32 .",
    "a similar situation also occurs in the sum rules for @xmath31 mass @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite attribute this difference to two possible reasons : violation of factorization in estimate of four - quark condensate or weak coupling of the tensor current to the @xmath31 meson . since the value of the @xmath31 meson decay constant for tensor current obtained from lattice calculation @xcite is in a reasonable region , we are inclined towards the first reason .",
    "our results go in line with the predictions obtained from the flux tube model @xcite . since the existence of the @xmath0 decay mode is also uncertain for both @xmath15 and @xmath14 in the experiments @xcite , follow - up studies of this decay mode will be of great help for understanding the nature of these exotic states .",
    "as shown from our calculation , higher twist ( in our case , twist-5 ) das contributions may play an important role in stabilizing the sum rules .",
