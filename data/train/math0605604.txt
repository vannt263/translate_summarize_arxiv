    "in this paper , we shall investigate the global behaviour of flat surfaces with singularities in euclidean 3-space @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , for the study of global properties of flat surfaces , considering only immersions is too restrictive , as is already clear from the classical fact ( fact 0.1 ) below .",

    "a point @xmath9 is called _ regular _ if @xmath1 is an immersion on a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath10 , and is called _ singular _ if it is not regular .",
    "if @xmath1 is an immersion and has zero gaussian curvature , it is called a ( regular ) flat surface .",
    "it is classically known that regular flat surfaces have open dense subsets which consist of a cylinder , cone , or tangential developable of space curves . moreover ,",
    "the following result is also well - known :    [ fact : i ] a complete regular flat surface is a plane or a cylinder .    the first proof of this fact came as a corollary of hartman and nirenberg @xcite .",
    "after that stoker @xcite and massey @xcite gave elementary proofs .",
    "to extend flat surfaces to a larger class that allows singularities , we shall now give the following definitions : a @xmath8-map @xmath7 is called a _ frontal _ if there exists a smooth unit vector field @xmath2 along @xmath1 such that @xmath2 is perpendicular to @xmath11 .",
    "by parallel displacement , @xmath2 can be considered as a map into the unit sphere @xmath12 . in this case , @xmath2 is called the _ gauss map _ of the frontal @xmath1 . moreover ,",

    "wave front_. using the canonical inner product , we identify the unit tangent bundle @xmath14 with the unit cotangent bundle @xmath15 , which has the canonical contact structure .",
    "when @xmath1 is a front , @xmath16 gives a legendrian immersion .",

    "a p - frontal is called _ co - orientable _ if it is a front ( that is , @xmath2 is globally defined on @xmath5 ) .",
    "the class of flat p - fronts is a canonical generalization of that of regular flat surfaces .",
    "in fact , the existence of a real analytic flat mbius strip is known ( @xcite ) , which is an example of a flat p - front without singular points",
    ".    we will now give two definitions for the completeness of flat fronts .",
    "[ def : complete ] a flat p - front @xmath7 with first fundamental form @xmath26 is called _ complete _ ( cf .",
    "* p150 ) ) if there exists a symmetric covariant tensor @xmath27 on @xmath5 with compact support such that @xmath28 gives a complete metric on @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath1 is complete and the singular set is non - empty , then the singular set must be compact , by definition .",
    "moreover , this new definition of completeness for flat fronts is a generalization of the classical one , namely , if @xmath1 is complete and has no singular points , then completeness coincides with the classical notion of completeness in riemannian geometry .    on the other hand , @xmath1 is called _ weakly complete _ if the sum of the first fundamental form and the third fundamental form ( called the _ lift metric _ of the p - front @xmath1 ) @xmath29 gives a complete riemannian metric on @xmath5 , which is the pull - back of the canonical metric on @xmath30 by @xmath31 .    obviously , _",
    "completeness implies weak completeness .",
    "_ completeness is convenient to describe the asymptotic behaviour of ends , but is not preserved when lifting to the universal cover . on the other hand ,",
    "the universal cover of a weakly complete flat front is also weakly complete .",
    "anyhow , using these definitions , we will prove our deepest result ( theorem a below ) :    * theorem a. * _ let @xmath5 be a connected 2-manifold , and @xmath7 a complete flat p - front whose singular set is non - empty @xmath22namely , the singular set of @xmath1 is compact and all ends of @xmath1 are immersed and complete@xmath23 .",
    "then it has no umbilic points and is a front .",
    "moreover , @xmath5 is diffeomorphic to a circular cylinder . _",
    "in particular , if a complete flat p - front admits an umbilic point , it must be a cylinder .",
    "we remark that theorem  a has two surprising consequences :    * a complete flat p - front is a front .",
    "in particular , it never contains a mbius strip as a subset .",
    "* singular points and umbilics never appear on the same complete flat front .",
    "moreover , as a consequence of theorem  a , we get the following representation formula for complete flat fronts :    * theorem b. * _ let @xmath32 be a regular curve without inflection points , and @xmath33 a 1-form on @xmath34 satisfying the period condition @xmath35 where @xmath36 is considered as a @xmath37-periodic @xmath0-valued 1-form on @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath39 gives a complete flat front whose image of the singular set coincides with that of @xmath40 .",
    "conversely , any complete flat fronts with non - empty singular set are given in this manner .",
    "_    a somewhat similar representation theorem for ( regular ) flat tori in the 3-sphere has been given by kitagawa @xcite , that is , a pair of two closed regular spherical curves satisfying a certain compatibility condition correspond to a flat torus in @xmath41 .",
    "as a consequence of theorem  b , outside of a ball of sufficiently large radius centered at the origin , the image of a complete flat front splits into two components , called the _ ends _ of the front .",
    "we shall prove the following :    * theorem c. * _ an end of a complete flat front @xmath1 with a singular point is properly embedded if and only if the other end is as well .",
    "moreover , the ends of @xmath1 are properly embedded if and only if the image of the gauss map of @xmath1 is a convex curve . _",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a given complete flat front in hyperbolic 3-space @xmath42 has embedded ends if and only if the sum of the topological degrees of the two hyperbolic gauss maps of the surface coincides with the number of ends .",
    "( in contrast to our case , there are complete flat fronts in @xmath42 with arbitrary genus and with many ends . )",
    "the above theorem is an analogue for @xmath0 , though our method is quite different from that of @xcite . as an application of theorem  b , theorem  c and the technique of disconjugate operators ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) , we prove in this paper the following    * theorem d. * _ let @xmath7 be a complete flat front with non - empty singular set .",
    "suppose that all ends of @xmath1 are embedded .",
    "then there exist at least four singular points of @xmath1 on @xmath5 which are not cuspidal edges .",
    "_    the proof of theorem  d is an analogue of that of the classical four vertex theorem for convex plane curves .",
    "the embeddedness of ends is truly required in the above statement .",
    "in fact , there exists a complete flat front in @xmath0 which admits only cuspidal edges .",
    "( see example [ ex : twist ] . )",
    "we show in section 4 ( see corollary  [ cor : sing ] ) that complete flat fronts which admit only cuspidal edges and swallowtails are generic .",
    "for such a generic front with embedded ends , theorem  d implies the existence of at least four swallowtails .    in section 1 ,",
    "we give fundamental properties of flat fronts . in section 2 , we define admissibility of developable frontal and give a representation formula for admissible developable frontals . in section 3 , we extend the representation formula to p - fronts . as an application , we show the existence of umbilic points on a developable mbius strip .",
    "in section 4 , theorem  a and theorem  b are proved . in section 5 , we shall prove theorem  c and theorem  d.    finally , we mention several related works : @xcite for flat fronts in @xmath41 ; @xcite , @xcite for behaviour of the gaussian curvature near cuspidal edges , swallowtails , and cuspidal cross caps ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite for singularity of spacelike maximal surfaces in @xmath43 and cmc-1 surfaces in de sitter 3-space ; @xcite for improper affine spheres with singularities ; @xcite for generic singularities of fronts of constant gaussian curvature in @xmath0 .",

    "when @xmath46 is of rank zero , then the gauss map @xmath2 of @xmath1 is an immersion at @xmath10 , and the parallel surface @xmath47 is an immersion at @xmath10 for all @xmath48 .",
    "so it is sufficient to consider the case that @xmath46 has a 1-dimensional kernel .",
    "then , we can take a local coordinate @xmath49 such that @xmath50 vanishes at @xmath10 , where @xmath51 are partial derivatives of the @xmath0-valued function @xmath1 with respect to the parameters @xmath52 . since @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 where @xmath55  denotes the canonical inner product on euclidean 3-space @xmath0 . since @xmath1 is a front and @xmath46",
