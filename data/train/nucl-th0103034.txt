    "interaction between nucleons in a nucleus may give rise to preferred orientations of the single - particle orbitals leading to deformed intrinsic shapes of the nuclei . with thermal excitations , they undergo a phase transition to spherical shapes .",
    "this has been studied in the experiments on the shapes of giant dipole resonances ( gdr ) built on excited states @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the mean field shape evolution with temperature has been attempted in a macroscopic approach @xcite generally referred to as the landau theory of phase transitions .",
    "they have also been studied in microscopic framework like finite - temperature non - relativistic hartree - fock @xcite and hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approaches @xcite with the pairing - plus - quadrupole ( p@xmath1q ) interaction .",
    "the shape transition temperature is found to be in the domain of @xmath2 to @xmath3 mev for the rare - earth nuclei .",
    "here the model hamiltonian is simplistic , the model space is small , an inert core is assumed and moreover , the role of the coulomb field is taken into consideration in an effective manner .",
    "recently , we have studied @xcite this same phenomenon in the framework of relativistic mean field theory ( rmf ) .",
    "here the model space is sufficiently large , all the nucleons are treated on equal footing and the coulomb interaction is properly accounted for .",
    "it is then found that the shape transition temperature is noticeably higher . except for some calculations in the s - d shell nuclei @xcite",
    ", nearly all the calculations have been done for nuclei in the rare - earth region ; it is found that the deformation undergoes a sudden collapse at the shape transition temperature .",
    "grossly , one understands the dissolution of the deformation with temperature in these nuclei from the following : shell structure leads to the population of the deformation - driving states , the so - called intruder states producing the static ground state deformation ; their depopulation with gradual heating restores the spherical symmetry .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to analyse in more microscopic details the collapse of the deformation with temperature . in doing so",
    ", we also explore whether the sudden collapse observed in the rare - earth nuclei is universal or system - specific .",
    "the stability towards the deformed ground state for the axially symmetric nuclei that we consider is given by the arrangement of the single - particle orbitals of good projection quantum number ; the evolution of the energies of these single - particle orbitals with temperature , particularly those near the fermi surface and also their occupancy evolution lead to a self - consistent rearrangement of the orbitals and thus can reveal in detail why the deformed nuclei undergo a shape transition .",
    "the non - linear @xmath0coupling term in the effective lagrangian has been introduced @xcite to reproduce properly the finite size effect , particularly the surface properties of nuclei .",
    "since the spin - orbit coupling term is sensitive to the fall of the density at the nuclear surface , the structure of the fermi surface is expected to depend on the non - linear term and thus might affect the ground state deformation and its thermal evolution .",
    "these aspects are also investigated using a parameter set ( hs ) where the non - linear @xmath4-coupling term is absent .    a brief discussion of the theoretical framework we employ is given in section ii .",
    "the results and discussions are presented in section iii .",
    "the concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "the details of the formalism are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "for the sake of completeness , however , we write down the effective lagrangian density describing the nucleon - meson many body system followed by a very brief discussion . the lagrangian density is given by @xmath5 the mesons included in the description are scalar - isoscalar @xmath4 , vector - isoscalar @xmath6 and vector - isovector @xmath7 mesons .",
    "the arrows in eq.([lag ] ) indicate isovector quantities .",
    "the scalar self - interaction term @xmath8 of the @xmath4 meson is taken to be non - linear @xmath9 the nucleon mass is @xmath10 ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the meson masses , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the coupling constants for the mesons and @xmath17 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the field tensors for @xmath6 and @xmath7 are given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; for the electromagnetic field , it is @xmath20 .",
    "recourse to the variational principle followed by the mean field approximation treating the field as @xmath21numbers results in the dirac equation for the nucleon and klein - gordon type equations for the mesons and the photon . for the static case , along with the time - reversal invariance and charge conservation ,",
    "the equations get simplified .",
    "the resulting equations , known as the relativistic hartree equations or rmf equations alongwith the bcs approximation for inclusion of pairing are solved to yield the fields and the single - particle energies .",
    "the self - consistent solutions are obtained using the basis expansion method @xcite ; this yields the quadrupole deformation @xmath22 and also the single - particle states as a function of temperature .",
    "for the values of the coupling constants and the masses of the mesons and the nucleons occuring in the lagrangian density given by eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) , we choose the nl3 parameter set .",
    "this parameter set reproduces the ground state properties of finite nuclei very well ; it yields also the compressional properties satisfactorily @xcite .",
    "the single - particle states are calculated using spherical oscillator basis with twelve shells .",
    "the values of the chemical potential and the pairing gap at a given temperature are determined using all the single - particle states upto @xmath23 above the fermi surface without assuming any core . in order to check the convergence of the calculation , we have enlarged the basis space from twelve to twenty shells and have extended the model space to include single - particle states upto @xmath24 above the fermi surface . for this extended model space , the pairing strength",
    "is adjusted to reproduce the ground state pairing gap .",
    "the change in the values of the observables are found to be insignificant due to this extension of the basis and the model space even at the highest temperature we consider .",
    "continuum corrections are neglected as their effects are found to be negligible @xcite in the temperature domain of relevance ( less than @xmath25 mev ) ; the shape transition temperatures for the systems considered are within this range .    in the rare - earth region",
    ", we have studied the thermal evolution of the shapes of even - even isotopes of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ; for neutron number 86 and 88 , their quadrupole deformation @xmath22 as a function of temperature is presented in fig .",
    "1 . the following aspects are apparent from the figure : ( i ) for the isotopes differing by two neutrons , the difference in the ground state deformation @xmath29 is significant , ( ii ) addition of two protons does not increase @xmath29 significantly ( compare @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , ( iii ) there is a close correlation between @xmath29 and the critical tempeature @xmath32 @xcite and that ( iv ) @xmath22 remains nearly constant with temperature and then there is a sudden collapse of the deformation near @xmath32 in a temperature window of @xmath33 mev . to elucidate these phenomena more clearly in microscopic terms",
    ", we present results for the thermal evolution of the single - particle levels and their occupancies in the next couple of figures for @xmath30 and @xmath34 .",
    "these representative cases guide one to draw inference about the shape evolution of the other nuclei . in figs . 2 - 5 ,",
    "the single particle levels near the fermi surface for the protons and the neutrons in @xmath30 and @xmath34 are displayed as a function of temperature .",
    "the fermi energies are shown by the dashed lines ; in the range of the temperature concerned , they are nearly constant .",
    "the ground state is axially symmetric and the levels are degenerate in @xmath35 , @xmath36 being the projection quantum number .",
    "the level structures remain practically unaltered upto @xmath37 mev for @xmath30 and upto @xmath38 mev for @xmath34 beyond which the different @xmath39levels pertaining to a definite ( @xmath40)-orbit start to converge . at the temperature @xmath32 ( 1.15 mev for @xmath30 and 1.6 mev for @xmath34 ) they become degenerate signifying transition to spherical symmetry .",
    "it may be mentioned that in the simplistic ( p+q ) model , the phase transition to a spherical shape occurs relatively earlier ; in a recent hfb calculation in an extended model space with the realistic gogny force @xcite , it has however been found that the transition temperature is in keeping with that found in our calculations in the rmf framework @xcite .",
    "examination of the single - particle spectra is helpful in understanding why the two neutron addition to @xmath30 increases the ground state deformation whereas the two proton addition does not alter it significantly .",
    "because of pairing , the occupancies of the states near the fermi surface is partial for a nucleus in its ground state . from figs",
    ". 3 and 5 one sees that the two neutron addition increases maximally the population of the @xmath41 state ( for the orbitals , we have used the notation @xmath42 ) ; the populations of the states @xmath43 and @xmath44 are also significantly enhanced .",
    "all these orbitals are intrinsically highly prolate which explains the increase in the ground state deformation of @xmath34 .",
    "( because of axially symmetry in the even - even nuclei we study , the projection @xmath36 is a good quantum number and is degenerate with ( @xmath45 ) because of time reversal invariance .",
    "the states @xmath42 just mentioned are the ones that have the largest amplitude for the orbital with projection @xmath36 ) . from figs . 2 and 4 we also note that the deep lying @xmath46 proton orbital in @xmath30 which is intrinsically oblate moves up closer to the fermi surface in @xmath34 and thus is less populated .",
    "this also contributes to the increase in the prolate deformation for @xmath34 .",
    "examination of the single - particle spectra for @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( not shown here ) shows that the addition of two protons does not practially affect the neutron occupancies near the fermi surface ; for protons only the @xmath47 orbitals get noticeably more populated thus slightly enhancing the deformation in the ground state for the @xmath31 nucleus compared to @xmath30 as shown in fig .",
    "1 . the ground state deformation properties of @xmath28 isotopes can be explained in a similar fashion .",
    "the suddenness of the transition from a prolate to the spherical shape at the temperature @xmath32 can be understood as follows : as the temperature rises , the states above the fermi surface get increasingly more populated at the expense of the states below .",
    "this causes a self - consistent reorganization of the single - particle field because of which the single - particle states evolve with temperature as depicted in figs . 2 - 5 .",
    "with increase in temperature for @xmath48 above @xmath49 0.5 mev , one finds from fig.6 for the proton orbitals in @xmath30 a tendency for equalisation of the single - particle occupancies for different @xmath39states emanating from the same @xmath50orbital . around @xmath32 , one could readily see the sharp drop in the occupancies of the prolate orbitals with an accompanied enhancement of the same for the oblate orbitals resulting in the rapid collapse of the deformation .",
    "the neutron orbitals ( not shown here ) have also the similar features .",
    "all these arguments apply also for the other rare - earth nuclei considered .    to examine whether the sudden collapse of the deformation as observed in the rare - earth nuclei is a generic feature or system - specific , one needs to consider the shape evolution of some other nuclei in a different mass region . for this purpose , we study two isotopes of zinc nuclei , namely @xmath51 and @xmath52 . as all the features related to shape evolution in these isotopes are found to be very similar , we discuss only the nucleus @xmath51 . in fig . 7 , we display the thermal evolution of the deformation @xmath22 for this nucleus . to draw a comparison of the shape evolution with the rare - earth systems",
    ", we also display in the same figure the temperature dependent deformation for the nucleus @xmath34 .",
    "it is seen that the fall - off of the deformation with temperature of @xmath51 is somewhat slower .",
    "this is magnified in fig.8 where the heat capacity per particle for the two systems @xmath34 and @xmath51 are displayed . for each curve ,",
    "the twin peaks at lower temperature correspond to the neutron and proton pairing transitions . for the ligher nucleus",
    ", this transition is relatively more prominent and is at a little higher temperature as expected .",
    "the peaks at higher temperatures ( @xmath53 mev for @xmath26 and @xmath54 mev for @xmath55 ) refer to the shape transition ; whereas it is very prominent for the rare - earth system , it is rather weak and looks more like a plateau for the @xmath51 nucleus signalling a relatively smoother shape transition to the spherical configuration .",
    "it is further that though the ground state deformations of these two nuclei are nearly the same , the transition temperature for @xmath51 is significantly higher .",
    "comparison of the thermal evolution of the level structures of @xmath51 ( shown in fig.9 ) with those of @xmath34 displayed in figs.4 and 5 may help in understanding the delayed shape transition in @xmath51 . for @xmath34 , in the vicinity of the transition temperature ,",
    "the single - particle orbitals of opposite intrinsic deformations cross each other near the fermi surface hastening ite approach towards a spherical configuration .",
    "the higher @xmath32 in @xmath51 may be partially attributed to the absence of these level crossings .",
    "it has been mentioned that the non - linear @xmath0coupling term is necessary to explain the surface properties of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "though in the absence of this term , the nuclear matter binding energy and the saturation density are reproduced , the binding energies of finite nuclei can not be obtained properly @xcite .",
    "the fall - off of the nucleon density profile at the surface is found to be stiffer without the non - linear term .",
    "since the spin - orbit splitting is proportional to the density gradient , this splitting is then likely to be larger without the non - linear @xmath0term .",
    "this may affect the single - particle level structure to which the shape evolution is expected to be sensitive . in order to study this effect on the ground state deformation and the thermal shape evolution of nuclei ,",
    "calculations have been performed with a parameter set that does not contain the non - linear @xmath0coupling term . the hs parameter set @xcite",
    "is chosen for this purpose . in fig .",
    "10 , the results for the temperature evolution of deformation @xmath22 are shown for two representative cases , namely , @xmath30 and @xmath34 .",
    "for comparison , @xmath22 with the nl3 parameter set for @xmath34 is also displayed in this figure .",
    "it is observed that with the hs set the ground state deformation is larger , the transition temperature smaller and that the collapse of the deformation is somewhat faster .",
    "the sharper deformation collapse is corroborated in the thermal evolution of the specific heat with and without the non - linear @xmath0term in the representative case of @xmath34 as shown in fig .",
    "11 ( upper panel ) .",
    "this is amplified further in the case of @xmath51 as shown in the bottom panel of the figure .",
    "the change in the ground state deformation obtained with the hs parameter set can be understood from the examination of the single - particle spectra near the fermi surface .",
    "for example , as shown in fig . 12 for the proton single - particle spectra for @xmath34 , the strong prolate deformation - producing @xmath56 and @xmath47 orbitals are significantly deeper down the fermi surface as compared to those displayed in fig . 4 for the nl3 parameter set .",
    "this is mostly responsible for the larger ground state deformation for @xmath34 .",
    "the somewhat sharper dissolution of the deformation with the hs parameter set is again traced back to the self - consistent occupancy evolution with temperature leading to the spherical configuration .",
    "comparison of fig . 12 with fig .",
    "4 shows that the spin - orbit splitting is significantly larger ( typically @xmath57 ) in case of hs parameter set as envisaged earlier .",
    "in this paper , we have attempted to understand in microscopic detail the shape evolutions of deformed nuclei with temperature in the rmf framework . for the rare - earth nuclei",
    "we have studied , namely , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 with 86 and 88 neutrons , it is seen that the ground state deformation increases with addition of neutrons appreciably whereas it is not that sensitive to proton addition .",
    "similar inference on the sensitivity of the shape transition temperature can be drawn to neutron and proton addition .",
    "it has been found that these transition temperatures are noticeably larger compared to those obtained in the schematic model with pairing - plus - quadrupole interaction but agree reasonably well with those calculated @xcite using a realistic force like the gogny force . from microscopic viewpoint",
    "the ground state deformation can be understood in terms of the single - particle level structure near the fermi surface .",
    "the sudden drop of the deformation can also be understood from the temperature - driven fast equalisation of the occupancies of different @xmath39states originating from the same @xmath50orbital near the fermi surface close to the transition temperature .",
    "we have also investigated the role of the non - linear self - coupling of the @xmath4 mesons on the shape evolution of the nuclei . in absence of the non - linear term ,",
    "the spin - orbit splitting is enhanced which affects the single - particle level structure near the fermi surface leading to a sharper shape transition at a lower temperature .",
