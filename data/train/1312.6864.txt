    "in a one - dimensional system strong electron - electron interactions cause non - fermi - liquid physics , which is described by the luttinger liquid theory  @xcite . nowadays quantum wires with rashba spin - orbit coupling in the external magnetic field attract a great deal of attention due to their special charge and spin transport , as well as spectral properties @xcite .",
    "the presence of spin - orbit coupling leads to a relative shift of the electronic dispersions for both spin species .",
    "furthermore , a magnetic field applied to the system lifts the spin degeneracy and causes the opening of a zeeman gap in the spectrum .",
    "if the chemical potential lies inside the gap , the system is equivalent to a spinful luttinger liquid with a spiral magnetic field .",
    "this peculiar state was abbreviated as a spiral luttinger liquid ( sll ) . in the presence of a bulk @xmath0-wave superconducting order , the wire becomes a topological superconductor and hosts majorana zero energy modes  @xcite .",
    "compelling evidence for the latter has been recently reported in experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is obviously of great interest to investigate the fate of superconducting correlations when embedded into the environment of the strongly interacting luttinger liquid .",
    "previous works considered the phase diagram for this system in the presence of bulk superconductivity  @xcite . here",
    "we develop a theory for the spatially and energy resolved tunneling spectroscopy of a spiral luttinger liquid which is brought into the proximity to a superconductor ( sc ) at its boundary .",
    "this proposal provides a way to disentangle the interplay between the complexity of the superconducting effects and the nontrivial electron liquid properties .",
    "it is very well known from the context of mesoscopic conductors that if the normal wire is placed between two superconductors , thus forming a superconductor - normal - superconductor junction , its spectral properties are strongly affected by the proximity effect  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the leakage of cooper pairs into the wire induces a nonvanishing superconducting pair amplitude which opens a gap in the spectrum of the wire . for wires with a length exceeding the superconducting coherence length , the gap is small , of the order of thouless energy @xmath1 , which evolves into the complete superconducting gap @xmath2 in the opposite limit of short wires .",
    "if the normal wire is replaced by the luttinger liquid conductor , then even without superconducting perturbations the density of states already has a striking feature .",
    "this is the famous zero - bias anomaly  the density of states vanishing as a power law near the fermi energy .",
    "@xcite one may naively expect that proximitizing the luttinger liquid with a superconductor would further facilitate depletion of the states near the fermi energy towards opening a gap .",
    "surprisingly , one discovers an entirely different scenario , an enhancement of the anomaly  the zero - bias peak  which physically can be rooted to the coherent backscattering from the interface of the subgap excitations that lead to the pileup of states near the zero energy  @xcite .",
    "the latter has interesting consequences for the josephson effect in the luttinger liquid constriction between superconducting leads  @xcite .",
    "a similar enhancement mechanism for tunneling has been also discussed for a luttinger liquid with impurity  @xcite . here",
    "we study this physics in the context of spiral luttinger liquids .",
    "the behavior of the tunneling density of states ( tdos ) is sensitive to the properties of the boundary between the luttinger liquid and a superconductor .",
    "competition between normal and andreev reflection for this system has been discussed recently in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we consider a perfect sc - sll interface that is dominated by an andreev boundary condition  @xcite . by performing a canonical transformation to separate a gapless field from a gapped field , and using a mode expansion",
    ", we obtain the low - energy asymptote for the tunneling density of states analytically .",
    "we conclude that although zeeman splitting and a rashba interaction destroy the tdos enhancement for the case when the chemical potential @xmath3 is detuned from the zeeman gap , an enhancement survives in the sll limit , namely , when @xmath3 lies within the gap .",
    "the power exponent of this anomaly is different as compared to that in the conventional case of a spinful luttinger liquid without spin - orbit coupling .",
    "an enhancement manifests only for distances close to the sc - sll interface in the wire , but disappears far away from the contact where strong correlations inherent to sll restore conventional power law suppression of tdos with additional oscillations .",
    "the latter contribution is reminiscent of friedel oscillations with the period renormalized by interactions  @xcite .",
    "we also compute the tunneling density of states numerically by using a self - consistent harmonic approximation and find the result to be consistent with the analytical calculations .     for two different cases :",

    "we consider an interacting one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum wire with rashba spin - orbit coupling in the @xmath6 direction and a magnetic field in parallel with the wire .",
    "both sides of the wire are in perfect contact with an @xmath0-wave superconductor .",

    "therefore , the magnetic field can be neglected in the low - energy limit from eq .  , and",
    "the model becomes the sc - spinful ll wire system with , however , an extra term , @xmath34 $ ] , due to the pair hopping processes  @xcite .",

    "( 2 ) , the cosine is only slowly oscillating and such a spatial modulation that is due to @xmath35 can be dropped out if @xmath36 . in that limit ,",
    "the magnetic field @xmath33 is relevant and will grow as energy decreases if @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "note that the pair hopping processes are strongly suppressed due to the zeeman gap .",
    "we will mostly focus on case ( 2 ) in this paper .",
    "we assume that the rashba wire - superconductor interfaces are very clean such that the andreev reflection is the dominant process at both boundaries . to treat the interfaces in the deep subgap limit , @xmath38 with sc gap @xmath2 , we apply the following fermion fields matching the condition  @xcite @xmath39 , where @xmath0 stands for spin - up and spin - down channels , respectively , and @xmath40 are the phases of the sc order for the left ( near @xmath41 ) and right ( near @xmath42 ) superconductors .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the spin - dependent gauge transformation used above to transform the hamiltonian leaves invariant both the cooper pairing term in the @xmath0-wave sc and the andreev boundary condition . to proceed ,",
