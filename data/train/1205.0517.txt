    "the aim of this paper is to find numerical solutions of mountain pass type for the problem @xmath0 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this is the equation of standing waves of the quasi - linear schrdinger equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 stands for the imaginary unit and the unknown @xmath5 is a complex valued function .",
    "various physically relevant situations are described by this quasi - linear equation .",
    "for example , it is used in plasma physics and fluid mechanics , in the theory of heisenberg ferromagnets and magnons and in condensed matter theory , see e.g.  the bibliography of  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the mountain pass solutions of the semi - linear equation @xmath6 , corresponding to ground states for the schrdinger equation @xmath7 have been extensively studied in the last decades , both analytically @xcite and numerically . on the numerical side ,",
    "the typical tool is the so - called mountain pass algorithm , originally implemented by choi and mckenna @xcite ( see also @xcite for a different approach ) .",
    "this works nicely under the assumption that the functional associated with the problem is of class @xmath8 on a hilbert space and it satisfies suitable geometrical assumptions .",
    "now , we observe that the functional @xmath9 naturally but only formally associated with is @xmath10 in fact , taking @xmath11 as @xmath12 with @xmath13 , then the functional is not even well defined , as it might be the case that it assumes the value @xmath14 in the range @xmath15 . in two dimensions , with @xmath16 , it is well defined from @xmath11 to @xmath17 but it is merely lower semi - continuous .",
    "if , instead , @xmath11 stands for the set of @xmath18 such that @xmath19 , then it follows that is well defined from @xmath11 to @xmath20 , for every choice @xmath21 . from the physical viewpoint defining @xmath11 in this way makes it a natural choice for the energy space . on the other hand , for initial data in this space @xmath11 , currently there is no well - posedness result for problem   ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath11 is not even a vector space , although @xmath22 can be regarded as a complete metric space endowed with distance the @xmath23 and it turns out that is continuous over @xmath22 suggesting that a possible approach to the study of problem could be to exploit the ( metric ) critical point theory developed in  @xcite . nevertheless , this continuity property is not enough to establish the convergence of a traditional mountain pass algorithm . actually , it is not even clear what a satisfying gradient for @xmath24 is .",
    "let us emphasize that we are interested in the convergence of the algorithm in infinite dimensional spaces which ensures the convergence of the discretized problem at a rate which does not blow - up when the mesh used for approximation becomes finer .",
    "hence , in conclusion , neither the mountain pass algorithm can be directly applied for the numerical computation of some solution of nor , to our knowledge , the current literature ( see e.g.  @xcite and the references therein ) contains suitable generalization of the mountain pass algorithm to the case of non - smooth functionals , except the case of locally lipschitz functional , which unfortunately are incompatible with the regularity available for our framework .",
    "on the other hand in @xcite , in order to find the existence and qualitative properties of the solutions to , a change of variable procedure was performed to relate the solutions @xmath25 to with the solutions @xmath26 to an associated semi - linear problem @xmath27 where the function @xmath28 is the unique solution to the cauchy problem @xmath29 more precisely , @xmath30 is a smooth solution ( say @xmath31 ) to if and only if @xmath32 is a smooth solution to , that is a critical point of the @xmath8-functional @xmath33 defined by @xmath34 in addition , as we shall see , the mountain pass values and the least energy values of these functionals correspond through the function @xmath35 .",
    "now , by applying the mountain pass algorithm to @xmath36 , we can find a mountain pass solution @xmath37 of .",
    "then @xmath38 will be a mountain pass solution of the original problem with a reasonable control on numerical errors .",
    "we mention that , at least in the case of large constant potentials @xmath39 and for a general class of quasi - linear problems , there are some uniqueness results for the solutions , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we will establish the equivalence between ground state solutions for @xmath24 and those for @xmath40 .",
    "section  [ sec : conv - mp ] will recall the mountain pass algorithm and discuss assumptions under which its convergence is guaranteed for our problem . in section  [ num ] , we will present our numerical investigations .",

    "we will call a ( nonlinear ) _ projector _ any function that is idempotent i.e. , any function @xmath49 such that @xmath50 for all @xmath51 .",

    "hence , numerically computing a mountain pass solution @xmath37 up to a certain error , yields a mountain pass solution @xmath56 to the original problem   up to a certain error ( involving also the error due to the numerical calculation of the solution @xmath35 to the cauchy problem in ) . in order to prove this , notice that @xmath33 defined by   reads @xmath57 where we have set @xmath58 with @xmath49 defined by  .",

    "second , if we consider a family of solutions @xmath190 on @xmath185 which is bounded and stays away from @xmath130 and we extend @xmath191 by @xmath130 on @xmath192 , we will now sketch an argument showing that @xmath190 converges up to a subsequence to a non - trivial solution on @xmath188 ( see also  @xcite where authors prove that , for some semilinear elliptic equations @xmath193 , ground state solutions on large domains weakly converge to a solution on @xmath188 ) .",

    "of course , if @xmath203 is bounded in @xmath188 then @xmath204 weakly converges to a translation of @xmath165 for any bounded family @xmath205 .",

    "@xmath207 in @xmath208 up to a subsequence .    as the moving plane method can be applied to the autonomous case ( see  @xcite ) , the positive solutions @xmath201 are even w.r.t.each hyperplane @xmath209 and are decreasing in each direction @xmath210 from @xmath211 to @xmath212 .",
    "as @xmath190 is bounded away from @xmath130 , the mass of @xmath201 is located around  @xmath130 .",
