    "an _ interval graph _ is the intersection graph of a set of intervals on a line .",
    "the set of intervals constitutes an _ interval model _ of the graph .",
    "figure  [ fig : intvalgraph ] gives an example .",
    "interval graphs play an important role in many problems , see @xcite .        the problem of recognizing whether a graph is an interval graph played a key role in the 1950 s in establishing the linear topology the fine - scale organization of genetic information in dna  @xcite .",
    "the linear topology of a dna molecule had been known since 1953 , when it was described by watson and crick .",
    "in addition , it was known that the collection of genes had a linear arrangement along the chromosome , since this arrangement could be inferred from recombination frequencies of alleles .",
    "this was not enough to establish what we now know , which is that the genetic information in a chromosome is written in its entirety onto a single dna molecule ( actually , two identical dna molecules called sister chromatids ) .",
    "what was known at that time did not exclude the possibility that the fine structure of the chromosome was organized around multiple independent dna molecules or one with small branches , giving it a tree - like topology that only appeared to be linear on a large scale .    to test the hypothesis that the fine structure was linear , seymour benzer isolated 145 mutant strains of a bacteria - infecting virus , t4  @xcite .",
    "he further hypothesized that each mutation occupied a contiguous region of the genome , which would be an interval of the genome if the topology was indeed linear .",
    "the test of these hypotheses consisted of finding a method for determining which pairs of mutations occupied intersecting regions of the genome , and then testing whether the derived intersection graph was an interval graph .    by themselves ,",
    "the strains are not viable . when bacteria are infected with two of the strains , however",
    ", the viruses can recombine their genomes to assemble the original viral genome , giving rise to viable viruses , provided that the regions occupied by their two mutations do not intersect . by infecting bacteria with a pair of strains and determining",
    "whether viable viruses arose , he was able to deduce the presence or absence of an edge in the intersection graph with high accuracy .",
    "he found an interval graph on 144 of the 145 strains that was consistent with thousands of tests .",
    "the anomalous strain had to be excluded when it was found to have two mutations that were not contiguous .",
    "the fraction of all graphs that are interval graphs on 144 vertices is minuscule , so this was a strong test of the hypothesis .",
    "the interval model he found for the graph gave one possible linear arrangement of the intervals occupied by the mutations , but this was not uniquely constrained by the graph , hence by the data .",
    "his paper gives the first characterization of interval graphs , based on combinatorial properties of their adjacency matrices , together with a heuristic for recognizing whether a graph is an interval graph .",
    "according to an acknowledgment at the end of the the paper , the characterization of interval graphs and the heuristic he used for recognizing them was due to the prominent biochemist leslie orgel of cambridge , who suggested it to him in a personal communication .",
    "as far as we know , the original characterization has not previously been attributed to orgel in the graph theory literature .",
    "this ignited considerable interest in the combinatorial study of interval graphs .",
    "lekkerkerker and boland gave a characterization in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs in 1962  @xcite .",
    "it also sparked a search for efficient algorithms for determining whether a graph is an interval graph  @xcite and producing an interval model if it is .",
    "booth and lueker gave the first linear - time algorithm for the problem in the 1970 s  @xcite .",
    "their algorithm determines whether the graph uniquely constrains the linear arrangement of the intervals .",
    "a _ ( partitioned ) probe interval graph _",
    "@xcite ( also called interval probe graph ) is a graph in which the vertex set is partitioned into _ probes _ and _ non - probes_. it is a generalization of intersection graph of an interval model , such that the graph has an edge between two vertices if their intervals intersect _ and at least one of them is a probe_. information about intersections of non - probe intervals is missing .",
    "such a model is a _ probe interval model _ of the graph .",
    "there has been quite a bit of work on topological and combinatorial properties of these graphs ; see  @xcite for a survey .",
    "the motivation that initially gave rise to interest in the class was for physical mapping of genomes  @xcite . rather than using mutations to deduce intersections , small fragments of single - stranded dna from a region of a genome",
    "were cloned and embedded in a filter , and then tested against probes taken from the complementary strands to see which probes hybridized ( bonded ) with them .",
    "hybridization indicates that the strands share a section that encodes for the same sequence of base pairs .",
    "if this sequence is long enough , it occurs on a unique interval of the genome , and therefore indicates that the strands come from intersecting intervals .",
    "only a subset of the fragments were used as probes .",
    "the intersections inferred by the procedure were represented by a probe interval graph , since no direct information about hybridization between non - probes was available in the experimental data .",
    "the possibility of deducing a probe interval model from the graph , especially if it was uniquely constrained , provided a possible way to infer the linear arrangement of the fragments .    at the time ,",
    "no efficient algorithm for deducing a probe interval model was known .",
    "the possibility that one might not exist was recognized as an obstacle to the approach  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "a heuristic based on breadth - first search was instead applied to the probe interval graph in the hopes of finding a chordless path in the probe interval graph that consisted of intervals that spanned the region of interest .",
    "an efficient algorithm for constructing probe interval models , had it been available , could have solved this problem reliably .",
    "a polynomial algorithm for the recognition and construction of probe interval models was first given by johnson and spinrad  @xcite , who gave an @xmath0 bound . using a different approach ,",
    "mcconnell and spinrad gave an @xmath1 algorithm  @xcite .",
    "uehara claimed an @xmath2 algorithm  @xcite that checks whether the model is unique , though some of the details have not been fully described .    in this paper , we give the first linear - time algorithm for the problem .",
    "that is , the input is a graph @xmath3 , where the @xmath4 is a partition of the vertices into probes and non - probes .",
    "the algorithm determines whether there exists a probe interval model of @xmath5 consistent with this partition of the vertices into probes and non - probes .",
    "if there is , the algorithm returns such a model .",
    "the algorithm also determines whether the layout of the model is unique , according to a slight generalization of a definition of uniqueness that is well - known in the case of interval graphs , and suitable for deducing the arrangement of intervals in a genome .",
    "this work appeared in preliminary form in  @xcite .",
    "all of the above algorithms take as input a graph whose vertex set is partitioned into probes and non - probes .",
    "chang et al .",
    "@xcite consider the problem of recognizing this graph class when this partition is not given .",
    "the original motivating application to biology has been superseded by more reliable and economical techniques .",
    "however , hybridizing pairs continue to be of interest for inferring whether intervals occupied by dna fragments intersect  @xcite , giving rise to intersection graphs .    in some cases",
    ", the intersection graphs continue to be modeled by probe interval graphs , rather than full interval graphs . for example , in _ contig scaffolding _ , there are two kinds of segments of the genome , _ contigs _ and intervals with _ paired - end tags _  @xcite . the sequence represented by a contig",
    "only small sequences at the extreme ends of a tagged intervals are known , however ; these are the paired - end tags .",
    "the intersections of contigs with each other and with paired - end tag intervals can be deduced .",
    "the tags are small compared to the lengths of their intervals . therefore , when two of these intervals intersect , their end tags are unlikely to intersect , and the intersection of their intervals can not be inferred directly . the graph given by the hybridization data",
    "is therefore modeled by a probe interval graph , where the contigs are the probes and the paired - end tag intervals are the non - probes .",
    "our algorithm would probably have been more useful for benzer than booth and lueker s , had these algorithms been available at the time , because he did not have the resources to perform all @xmath6 experiments needed to construct the full interval graph on @xmath7 mutations .",
    "an obstacle to the usefulness of efficient algorithms for construction of interval models from hybridization data is that , at the time of this writing , hybridization data are prone to many false positives and false negatives .",
    "this corrupts the experimentally derived graph by adding or removing edges in the true intersection graph , and with high probability , this will give rise to a graph that is no longer an interval graph or probe interval graph .",
    "this is one reason that the proposed method of  @xcite never become competitive with alternative sequencing techniques .",
    "advances in in the accuracy of detecting intersections , either by hybridization or by some unforeseen method , before our algorithm for constructing probe interval models , or booth and lueker s algorithm for constructing interval models , are very useful in physical mapping or sequencing .",
    "benzer s methods , however , illustrate that it may be difficult to foresee clever future laboratory methods that could give rise to highly accurate intersection data in the future .    despite impracticality of applying it to noisy biological data",
    ", the algorithm of booth and lueker continues to be studied by people working with hybridization data , because of the structural insights it gives about the graph class .",
    "the concepts it uses , such as the _ consecutive - ones property _ and _ pq trees _",
    "( discussed below ) have given rise to methods that are more tolerant of errors in the data  @xcite .",
    "one contribution of our paper is to give analogous structural insights into the class of probe interval graphs .",
    "a _ circular - arc graph _ is the intersection graph of arcs on a circle .",
    "circular - arc graphs are a generalization of interval graphs ; interval graphs are those circular - arc graphs that have a model where the arcs do not cover the entire circle .",
    "this generalization , which reflects constraints in cyclic scheduling problems , for example , is much less structured than interval graphs .",
    "for example , in interval graphs , the number of maximal cliques is bounded by the number of vertices , while in circular - arc graphs , it can be exponential in the size of the graph  @xcite .",
    "interval graphs are a subclass of the class of perfect graphs , while circular - arc graphs are not .",
    "when booth and lueker developed their linear - time algorithm for recognizing interval graphs and producing interval models , booth conjectured that the corresponding problems for circular - arc graphs would turn out to be np - complete  @xcite .",
    "the conjecture was later disproved  @xcite , and the first linear - time algorithm was given in  @xcite .",
    "the ability to find a probe interval model for a probe interval graph was an essential step in the result of  @xcite .",
    "the class of probe interval graphs was described independently in an early draft of that paper , before it was pointed out that it had previously been described in connection with a biological application .",
    "the paper used an algorithm for recognizing probe interval graphs and finding a probe interval models that is described in  @xcite . even though the algorithm of  @xcite is not linear",
    ", it does not violate the linear time bound for the circular - arc graph recognition algorithm , since it operates on a graph whose size is sublinear in the size of @xmath5 .",
    "one interpretation of a probe interval graph is that it is an interval graph where reports of adjacencies by non - probe vertices are missing or distrusted .",
    "adjacencies between the trusted and the untrusted vertices can be obtained from the trusted vertices ; only adjacencies between pairs of untrusted vertices are unknown .",
    "this interpretation is driven by applications that have been identified so far .",
    "another interpretation is that interval graphs are used to represent conflicts and compatibilities in scheduling problems .",
    "their membership in the class of perfect graphs ( see @xcite ) gives rise to efficient algorithms for finding maximum independent sets , maximum cliques , and minimum colorings  @xcite , which correspond to sets of interest for finding efficient schedules .",
    "probe interval graphs , which are also perfect graphs ( see  @xcite ) , introduce a third possibility , which is that a subset of the jobs do not have a conflict even if their intervals intersect . for example , if some of the jobs require a dedicated resource for technical or security reasons , while others can share the resource , then the conflicts are modeled with a probe interval graph , where the jobs that require exclusive access are the probes and those that do not are the non - probes . a linear - time algorithm for finding a maximum clique and minimum coloring , given a probe interval model ,",
    "is given in  @xcite .",
    "a consequence of our result is therefore a linear - time algorithm for minimum coloring and maximum clique , given the partitioned probe interval graph .",
    "an open problem is whether a maximum independent set and minimum clique cover can be found in linear time from the probe interval model .",
    "a _ consecutive - ones ordered matrix _ is a 0 - 1 matrix in which 1 s in each row are consecutive .",
    "a _ consecutive - ones ordering _ of a 0 - 1 matrix is permutation of its columns that gives a consecutive - ones ordered matrix .",
    "a 0 - 1 matrix has the _ consecutive - ones property _ if there exists a consecutive - ones ordering of it .",
    "a family @xmath8 of subsets of a set @xmath9 has the _ consecutive - ones property _ if there exists an ordering of elements of @xmath9 such that each member of @xmath8 is consecutive .",
    "the two concepts are equivalent , since @xmath8 can be represented using one row for each @xmath10 , one column for each element of @xmath9 , and a 1 in row @xmath11 , column @xmath12 if set @xmath11 contains element @xmath13 of @xmath9 , and the resulting matrix has the consecutive - ones property if and only if the set family does . a _",
    "consecutive - ones matrix _ is one that has the consecutive - ones property ; it is not necessarily consecutive - ones ordered .    as part of their algorithm to recognize interval graphs , booth and lueker developed an algorithm to determine whether a matrix is a consecutive - ones matrix , and , if so , to produce a consecutive - ones ordering of it , in time proportional to the number of rows , columns , and 1 s in the matrix , given a sparse representation .",
    "we use this result extensively in this paper .",
    "the _ consecutive - ones sandwich _ problem is an extension of the consecutive - ones problem , where each entry is 0 , 1 or @xmath14 .",
    "an @xmath14 is a `` do nt care '' ; it can stand for either a 0 or a 1 .",
    "the problem is to find an assignment of 0 s and 1 s to the @xmath14 s such that the resulting matrix has the consecutive - ones property .",
    "deciding whether this is possible is np - complete  @xcite .",
    "this fact was recognized as a possible obstacle to efficient construction of probe interval models in  @xcite . the _ consecutive - ones probe matrix _",
    "problem is the special case where we require that the @xmath14 s form a submatrix ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is also a generalization of the consecutive - ones problem .",
    "we give an algorithm that takes time that is linear in the number of rows , columns , and 1 s in @xmath15 to find a solution or determine that none exists .",
    "this requires an efficient representation of @xmath15 that does not represent the @xmath14 s explicitly , and our solution gives an implicit assignment of 0 s and 1 s to @xmath14 s .",
    "the @xmath14 s can be assigned values explicitly , but the number of them might not be linear in the size of the input . in this paper , we develop methods for reducing the problem of constructing probe interval models to that of solving the consecutive - ones probe matrix problem .",
    "when booth and lueker s algorithm determines that a matrix has the consecutive - ones property , it gives an implicit representation of _ all _ consecutive - ones orderings of a matrix , called a _",
    "pq tree_. ( see figure  [ fig : pqexample ] . )    the leaves of the pq tree are the one - element subsets of the set of columns of the matrix .",
    "the pq tree gives all consecutive - ones orderings by constraining the orderings of children of internal nodes , as follows .",
    "some of the internal nodes are labeled _",
    "p nodes_. for such a node every ordering of its children is permitted .",
    "others are labeled _",
    "q nodes_. for such a node , an ordering of its children is given ; the only permissible orderings of its children are the given ordering and its reverse .",
    "for a pq tree @xmath16 , let @xmath17 denote the set of all possible orderings of its leaves , given these constraints .",
    "@xmath16 uniquely determines @xmath17 .",
    "we consider different orderings of the pq tree that are consistent with the constraints to be the same pq tree .",
    "the algorithm of booth and lueker  @xcite either finds the unique pq tree @xmath18 such that @xmath17 is equal to the consecutive - ones orderings of columns of a matrix @xmath15 , or determines that the matrix is not a consecutive - ones matrix .",
    "it is also easy to see that @xmath17 uniquely determines @xmath16 for any pq tree .",
    "one way to see this is an algorithm we give below that , given @xmath16 , constructs a matrix whose consecutive - ones orderings are @xmath17 , which then has a unique pq tree by booth and lueker s result .",
    "a significant part of our paper is devoted to developing general results about pq trees and consecutive - ones ordered matrices that then allow us to derive our algorithm for probe interval graphs .",
    "we develop proof techniques and useful results about the relationships between the pq trees of a matrix and those of its submatrices .",
    "see , for example , section  [ sect : pqtrees ] , and , for examples of applications , sections  [ sect : sufficiency ] and  [ sect : c1pm ] ) .",
    "we give examples of how booth and lueker s algorithm can be exploited as a black box for answering constraint satisfaction questions that do not correspond to ones that it had been originally designed for .",

    "uehara claims a data structure for implicitly representing all possible probe interval models , though some details required to verify it are missing  @xcite .",
    "the time bound he gives for constructing it is @xmath19 .",
    "we develop a structure based on a pair of pq trees that has this capability ( figure  [ fig : probeones ] ) , and we construct it in time that is linear in the size of the graph .",
    "except for some additional definitions , we use standard terminology and conventions from  @xcite .",

    "if @xmath51 is a column of @xmath15 , then we let @xmath52 denote @xmath50[r(m ) \\setminus \\{c\\}]$ ] .",
    "we will often treat the columns of a 0 - 1 matrix as _ sets _ , where each column is the set @xmath53 of rows in which the column has a 1 .",
    "a shortcoming of this convention is that , unlike a dynamic list , a set has no identity independent of its contents .",
    "we want a column to retain its identity when we add or remove a row from the matrix , even though the set it represents may change .",
    "also , if two columns represent the same set , we want them to have separate identities , which they retain even when we permute the column order .",
    "we therefore assume that each column @xmath54 has an identity separate from its current contents , much like a dynamic list . taking a submatrix @xmath49",

    "though this notation is convenient in mathematical expressions , we will sometimes ignore the distinction between a column and the set it represents in english sentences when the meaning is clear .",

    "the size of the representation , as measured on the ram model , is proportional to the number of rows , columns and 1 s and we consider an algorithm to run in linear time if it runs in time proportional to this size . using elementary methods ,",
    "such a representation can be obtained in linear time from a list of the positions of nonzero elements in each row or in each column .",
    "the order of rows and columns can also be permuted arbitrarily in linear time",
    ". a submatrix can be represented with ordered lists of pointers to a subset of rows and columns .",
    "we define the _ cliques _ of a graph to be its _ maximal _ complete subgraphs .",

    "this differs from some papers that refer to _ the _ clique matrix , reflecting the view that the purpose of the matrix is to represent the family of cliques , and the order of columns is unimportant . by our convention ,",

    "a _ chordal graph _ is a graph with no induced cycle of size greater than three . a chordal graph has @xmath66 cliques , and the sum of their cardinalities is @xmath67 , so a sparse representation of a clique matrix takes @xmath67 space .",
    "it takes @xmath67 time to find a sparse representation of a clique matrix of a chordal graph by the algorithm of rose , tarjan and lueker  @xcite .    booth and lueker s algorithm  @xcite for recognizing interval graphs uses the algorithm of rose , tarjan and lueker",
    "either to determine that the graph is not chordal , in which case it is not an interval graph , or else to produce a sparse representation of a clique matrix .",
    "it then uses the fact that a graph is an interval graph if and only if its cliques have the consecutive - ones property .",

    "two vertices of a graph are adjacent if and only if they are members of a common clique , so two of these intervals intersect if and only if their vertices are adjacent .",
