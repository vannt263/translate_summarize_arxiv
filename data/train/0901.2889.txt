    "quantum electrodynamics in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time has wide applications in a number of planar strongly correlated systems , including fractional quantum hall system , heisenberg quantum antiferromagnet , and high-@xmath9 cuprate superconductor . among its numerous variants ,",
    "the massless spinor qed@xmath10 and the @xmath11 model are particularly interesting .",
    "they both exhibit fruitful physics in the context of quantum field theory and have proved to be powerful in understanding some fundamental physics of cuprate superconductors .",
    "it is widely accepted that the @xmath12-@xmath13 model captures the essential physics of cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "however , it is far from clear how to treat this model by satisfactory analytic tools .",
    "one frequently used approach to deal with the @xmath12-@xmath13 model is based on the slave - particle technique @xcite .",
    "for example , the electron operator on @xmath14-lattice @xmath15 can be decomposed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the operator of spin - carrying spinon and @xmath18 represents the charge - carrying holon .",
    "such decomposition has a redundancy since the electron operator is invariant under the transformations @xmath19 which can be considered as an emergent gauge symmetry .",
    "this emergent gauge structure has very important effects on the whole physical picture and has been investigated extensively for twenty years @xcite .",
    "however , such decomposition is not unique and one can alternatively use the so - called slave - fermion approach , in which the spin quantum number is carried by scalar field @xcite and the gauge charge is carried by fermionic matter field @xcite .",
    "recently , a new state of matter , named as algebraic charge liquid , was proposed to describe the low - energy properties of cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "the effective field theory of this state consists of @xmath20-flavor massless dirac fermions , @xmath3-flavor scalar bosons , and a u(1 ) gauge field .",
    "this effective theory can be loosely considered as a combination of massless spinor qed@xmath10 and @xmath21 model @xcite .",
    "it has been used to understand certain quantum phase transitions and various exotic properties near the quantum critical points @xcite .",
    "recently , this model was studied by kaul and sachdev @xcite with emphasis put on the anomalous dimensions and some observable thermodynamic quantities including specific heat and susceptibility near the quantum critical point between higgs and coulomb phases .",
    "when interacting with u(1 ) gauge field , there is an interesting possibility that the massless dirac fermion might undergo a vacuum condensation , which then generates a finite mass for dirac fermion @xcite .",
    "this mass breaks the continuous chiral symmetry possessed by dirac fermions and leads to new phenomena .",
    "another characteristic property of qed@xmath10 is that the strong gauge field can confine the matter fields that carry nonzero gauge charges @xcite . in the absence of scalar field",
    ", it is found that the fermion mass can be generated only for flavor @xmath22 @xcite , and confinement takes place once the mass is generated @xcite .",
    "if the gauge field also couples to the scalar field @xmath23 , then the phenomena related to chiral phase transition and confinement will be modified by the dynamics of scalar bosons .    in this paper",
    ", we study chiral phase transition and confinement of matter fields in the vicinity of the quantum critical point .",
    "the critical fermion flavor @xmath2 depends on two parameters : the scalar boson flavor @xmath3 and the scalar boson mass @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath24 , the system stays in the coulomb phase , while @xmath7 defines the quantum critical point that separates the coulomb phase from the higgs phase . when the chiral symmetry is dynamically broken , the massless fermions become massive and are confined if @xmath6 ; while the dirac fermions and @xmath23 bosons are deconfined at the quantum critical point @xmath7 .",
    "since the confined and deconfined matter fields behave quite differently , the coulomb phase and the critical point have completely different low - energy elementary excitations .",
    "thus it is possible to specify the quantum critical point and to verify whether the chiral symmetry is dynamically broken by measuring observable physical quantities such as specific heat and susceptibility .",
    "we calculate these quantities within the effective gauge theory and discuss their behaviors at low temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we study the dynamical mass generation for dirac fermions in section 2 .",
    "the confinement / deconfinement properties of matter fields is discussed in section 3 .",
    "we then calculate the specific heat and susceptibility at quantum critical point @xmath0 in section 4 and in the coulomb phase with @xmath6 in section 5 .",
    "the last section contains summary and discussion .",
    "the action for the interaction between massless dirac fermion and u(1 ) gauge field is @xmath26 where the fermion has @xmath20 flavor .",
    "the spinor field @xmath27 describes the superconducting quasiparticle that carries physical electric charge . here ,",
    "for generality we keep the kinetic term of gauge field .",
    "following kaul and sachdev @xcite , we consider only _",
    "non_-_compact _ gauge field and omit the instanton excitations , so the above field theoretic model might not precisely match the low - lying theory of cuprate superconductors ( there are theoretical and simulation evidence for the irrelevance of instantons in the presence of massless dirac fermions with sufficiently large flavor @xmath20 @xcite ) . in order to define chiral symmetry ,",
    "we adopt a four - component representation of spinor field @xmath27 and three @xmath28 matrices @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) satisfying the clifford algebra , @xmath31 . since the fermions are massless , the action @xmath32 respects the following continuous chiral symmetry @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 being two @xmath36 matrices that anticommute with @xmath37 .",
    "the action contains no small coupling constant and generally can only be treated using the @xmath38 expansion .",
    "the free propagator for dirac fermion is @xmath39 the interaction with gauge field modifies it into the complete fermion green function @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fermion self - energy function .",
    "generically , the fermion self - energy can be written as @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the wave functional renormalization and @xmath44 the fermion mass function . to calculate the fermion self - energy , we can use either conventional perturbation expansion method or non - perturbative approach . if the usual perturbation theory is used , then the self - energy function is proportional to @xmath45 to the leading order of @xmath38 expansion @xcite , which represents only a correction to the wave function ( field operator ) .",
    "when combined with the free propagator @xmath46 , this self - energy modifies the fermion propagator to a new form @xmath47 which reflects the typical behavior of algebraic charge / spin liquid @xcite .",
    "this result implies that , to the leading order , the gauge fluctuation is only a marginal perturbation and no mass term @xmath44 is generated .",
    "in fact , such mass term can never be generated to any finite order of perturbative expansion .",
    "this can be understood by the symmetry arguments .",
    "both the free action ( [ eq : l_qed3 ] ) and the term @xmath48 are chiral symmetric , but the mass term @xmath44 is not chiral symmetric .",
    "therefore , it is the chiral symmetry of the action that prevents the occurrence of mass term @xmath44 .",
    "however , the perturbation theory can not tell us everything .",
    "although the action is chiral symmetric , it is possible that its ground state does not respect the chiral symmetry and the dirac fermion acquires a finite dynamical mass .",
    "indeed , the generation of nonzero @xmath44 signals the happening of a phase transition and the reconstruction of the ground state , which are surely non - perturbative in nature and can not be analyzed by ordinary perturbation theory .",
    "the standard non - perturbative approach to the problem of dynamical fermion mass generation is to solve the dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equation for the fermion mass function , which was originally proposed by nambu and jona - lasinio in the context of particle physics @xcite .",
    "the ds equation can be written in the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the vertex function and @xmath51 the photon propagator .",
    "after a series of manipulations , the above equation is decomposed into a couple of equations for @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively @xmath52 if the ds equation for @xmath44 has only vanishing solution , the fermions remain massless and are stable against gauge fluctuations . whenever the equation develops a nontrivial solution @xmath44 , the massless fermion acquires a finite mass .",
    "the crucial difference between the perturbative and non - perturbative approaches is that the ds equation is nonlinear which makes it possible for chiral phase transition to happen at the bifurcation point .",
    "the logic presented above is analogous to the gap generation for fermion excitations in the bcs theory of conventional superconductors . in a normal metal ,",
    "when we compute the mean value @xmath53 using ordinary perturbative expansion , only vanishing result can be obtained .",
    "it could be understood that the local gauge symmetry of the system prevents the appearance of nonzero @xmath54 which is not gauge invariant .",
    "however , a finite gap can be obtained by solving the nonlinear gap equation that is constructed by non - perturbative approach .",
    "apparently , the local gauge symmetry does not prevent the gap generation ; on the contrary , this symmetry is spontaneously broken by the finite gap since @xmath55 .",
    "the gap generation signals a phase transition from normal metal to superconductor .",
    "in fact , the idea of dynamical fermion mass generation was motivated by the cooper pairing picture in bcs theory @xcite .",
    "the order parameter for chiral phase transition is just the fermion mass term @xmath56 which is caused by fermion vacuum condensation .    for the spinor qed model ( [ eq : l_qed3 ] )",
    ", the chiral phase transition has been studied for many years .",
    "it is known that there exists a critical fermion flavor @xmath2 which separates the chiral symmetric phase ( @xmath57 ) from the chiral symmetry broken ( @xmath5 ) phase @xcite .",
    "the critical flavor is about @xmath58 to the leading order of @xmath38 expansion @xcite .",
    "we now add the action of complex scalar field . at half - filling ,",
    "the cuprate superconductor is a mott insulator with long - range neel order .",
    "the neel order parameter @xmath59 can be represented by the scalar boson operator @xmath60 by @xmath61 then the neel state can be described by an effective field theory called @xmath21 model , where @xmath3 is the flavor of scalar field @xmath60 .",
    "this model admits an emergent local gauge symmetry , as demonstrated by polyakov @xcite , and has been successfully used to describe the planar heisenberg quantum antiferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "its action is @xcite @xmath62.\\ ] ] the lagrangian multiplier @xmath63 is introduced to impose the constraint @xmath64 .",
    "it takes on a uniform saddle point value that extremizes the action @xmath65 , @xmath66 for @xmath67 , the system stays in the coulomb phase with @xmath68 ; for @xmath69 , the system is in the neel phase where the su(n@xmath70 ) rotational symmetry is broken by @xmath71 . in this paper",
    ", we only consider the phase with @xmath68 . at the @xmath72 limit",
    ", the quantum critical point locates at @xmath0 , where @xmath73 satisfying @xmath74 from these formula , we have @xmath75 from which the mass parameter @xmath76 for finite @xmath3 , the scalar field @xmath23 receives self - energy correction from gauge fluctuations ,",
    "so the critical point is no longer at @xmath0 . even in this case",
    ", one can define a new quantity @xmath77 so that the system goes critical as it vanishes @xcite . here , we simply use the single parameter @xmath4 to denote the boson mass .    the additional coupling between gauge field and scalar field will affect the critical flavor @xmath2 .",
    "the ds equation of fermion self - energy function will be studied within the @xmath38 expansion . in the landau gauge , the gauge boson propagator has the expression @xmath78 } \\big(\\delta_{\\mu\\nu } - \\frac{q_{\\mu}q_{\\nu}}{q^{2}}\\big),\\ ] ] where the polarization function is given by @xmath79 with the fermion contribution @xmath80 ( fig .",

    "fig : pi_z1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : pi_z2 ] ) is @xmath82 inserting the propagator @xmath83 into the mass equation , then the critical fermion flavor @xmath2 becomes a function of @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "we now determine this dependence by solving the mass equation .    to the lowest - order",
    ", the wave function renormalization can be simply taken to be @xmath84 since the next - leading order is suppressed by a factor of @xmath38 . in the landau gauge",
    ", the vertex function reduces to @xmath85 , as required by the ward identity . under these approximations ,",
    "the mass equation is relatively simple . to go beyond this approximation",
    ", one should solve the coupled equations for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "further , once @xmath86 , the vertex function can no longer be taken to be @xmath29 .",
    "it must be chosen properly to be consistent with the ward identity .",
    "as it turns out , the ds equations become much more complicated after including these higher order corrections .",
    "it is also difficult to chose a proper vertex function .",
    "fortunately , there is a very useful technique @xcite which simplifies the calculation . to use this technique ,",
    "we first write the following propagator for gauge boson @xmath78 } \\big(\\delta_{\\mu\\nu } - \\xi(q^{2 } ) \\frac{q_{\\mu}q_{\\nu}}{q^{2}}\\big),\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is a gauge fixing parameter that depends on momentum . taking advantage of the gauge symmetry",
    ", one can choose a so - called non - local gauge @xmath87 so that the wave function renormalization is strictly unity , @xmath88 . then the vertex function becomes @xmath85 .",
    "the gauge parameter is determined by the following expression @xmath89 now we only need to solve a single ds equation for mass function @xmath90 this integral equation is much more easily solved numerically than the coupled equations of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "it reduces to the mass equation in landau gauge when the gauge parameter @xmath91 .",
    "there must be a critical fermion flavor @xmath2 below which a finite fermion mass is generated .",
    "we solved the ds equation @xcite in both the landau gauge and the non - local gauge , with results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : landau ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal ] respectively .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath4 now becomes dimensionless since it is re - scaled by some intrinsic energy scale ( the parameter @xmath92 defined in the paper of appelquist _ et _ _ al . _",
    "the results show that the boson mass @xmath4 increases the critical fermion flavor @xmath2 and that the boson flavor @xmath3 reduces @xmath2 for small mass @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath4 is of the order unity , the effect of scalar boson @xmath60 on @xmath2 drops out and the critical flavor @xmath2 is independent of @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "this is easy to understand because for large @xmath4 the scalar boson contribution to polarization @xmath93 can be neglected compared with the fermion contribution @xmath94 at low momenta . if we believe that the results obtained in the non - local gauge is more reliable than that in landau gauge , then the critical flavor @xmath95 for @xmath96 . when the physical fermion flavor @xmath97 , a finite fermion mass is always generated for @xmath96 .    once the fermion mass is generated , the system is no longer critical even at the quantum critical point @xmath0 .",
    "the nonzero value of @xmath56 corresponds to the formation of charge density wave since the fermion field @xmath27 carries only electric charge . as the result of dynamical breaking of continuous chiral symmetry ,",
    "there appear massless goldstone bosons which are fermion - antifermion pairs .",
    "the finite fermion mass has substantial effects on various observable physical quantities , to which we turn in the next three sections .",
    "when the scalar bosons condense , @xmath71 , the gauge boson becomes massive due to anderson - higgs mechanism .",
    "the effect of gauge boson mass on @xmath2 has been discussed previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that this mass rapidly suppresses the dynamical mass generation for dirac fermions .",
    "we will not repeat such considerations in the present paper .",
    "when applying the effective field theory to realistic cuprate superconductors , the dirac fermions actually have two velocities , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , with @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "although the velocity anisotropy is important in certain physical quantities , it was shown @xcite to be irrelevant near the critical point of chiral phase transition .",
    "indeed , in most publications on spinor qed@xmath10 the velocities are simply set to unity , i.e. , @xmath101 @xcite .",

    "@xmath106 , the form of gauge potential @xmath107 depends only on whether the fermion mass is zero or finite @xcite . for massless fermion , the vacuum polarization is @xmath108 . since @xmath109 , the confining potential is destroyed .",
    "after the fermion mass is generated , the polarization function @xmath110 becomes @xmath111 in the limit @xmath112 , it has a finite value @xmath113 thus in the symmetry breaking phase , the gauge potential is confining and there can not be any asymptotic fermion states @xcite .",
    "note the gauge field considered here is _",
    "non_-_compact _ and there are no topological instanton configurations . the confinement is induced completely by the gauge force between particles with opposite charges .",
    "it is a special feature of gauge field in two spatial dimensions .",
    "however , the gauge potential @xmath107 is modified by the additional scalar boson . depending on the fermion mass @xmath114 and the scalar boson mass @xmath4 ,",
    "there are four possibilities :    1 .",

    "@xmath118 and @xmath122 , @xmath124 is finite .",
    "compared with the case without scalar bosons , there appears a new possibility : at exactly the critical point where @xmath0 , the gauge potential is always deconfined , irrespective of whether the chiral symmetry is broken or not .",
    "this implies that , in the chiral symmetry broken phase , the matter fields carrying internal gauge charges are deconfined at the quantum critical point @xmath0 , but are always confined once the system enters the coulomb phase with @xmath6 .",
    "the deconfined matter fields will make finite contribution to observable physical quantities , such as specific heat and susceptibility , but the confined matter fields make no contributions to them . in the confining phase , only excitations with zero gauge charge can be mobile and make finite contributions to observable quantities . obviously , the quantum critical point and the coulomb phase have rather different low - energy elementary excitations .",
    "it is possible to distinguish the critical point from the coulomb phase by measuring the observable quantities .",
    "these quantities can also be used to judge whether dynamical chiral symmetry breaking happens or not .",
    "we first discuss the quantum critical point , @xmath0 , where the dirac fermions and @xmath23 bosons are deconfined . in this point ,",
    "the low - energy elementary excitations are : massive dirac fermion @xmath27 , massless scalar boson @xmath23 , and composite massless goldstone boson .",
    "the gauge field is strongly interacting with dirac fermions and scalar bosons , so it makes finite contributions to the specific heat and susceptibility .",

    "after numerical computations , the results for specific heat and susceptibility are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : tq_m4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : tq_m5 ] .",
    "apparently , the gauge contributions to specific heat and susceptibility are significantly suppressed by the mass of dirac fermions . here , in order to show the explicit results , we use the absolute value of @xmath197 ( @xmath198 ) instead of @xmath199 ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "although @xmath0 at the critical point , for completeness we also present the results for some magnitudes of finite @xmath4 in fig . [",
    "fig : tq_m5 ] .",
    "if @xmath57 , the fermions remain massless and the matter fields carrying internal gauge charges are not confined at finite @xmath4 . in such state , the mass @xmath4 suppresses the specific heat and susceptibility of @xmath23 bosons .    in summary , at the critical point @xmath0",
    ", both fermionc and gauge field contributions to specific heat and susceptibility are suppressed by the dynamical fermion mass . at low temperature",
    ", the total specific heat receives contributions mainly from three parts : free scalar boson @xmath23 , the composite goldstone boson , and the fluctuation of field @xmath63 . since the @xmath23 and goldstone bosons are both massless , these three contributions to specific heat are all proportional to @xmath201 , with coefficients @xmath202 being temperature independent .",
    "however , the scalar bosons carry nonzero internal gauge charge , while the goldstone bosons are neutral . therefore , the former lead to a @xmath203 susceptibility ( to @xmath130 ) , while the latter does not couple to any magnetic field ( @xmath131 , @xmath130 , or the physical @xmath204 ) and hence make no contribution to susceptibility .",
    "we now consider the coulomb phase with @xmath6 . once the logarithmic gauge potential confines all particles that carry internal gauge charges , the excitations appearing at low energy regime must be neutral with respect to internal gauge charge .",
    "now the massive fermions can combine either with anti - fermions or with massive scalar bosons carrying opposite gauge charges . in the former case ,",
    "the corresponding composite particles are just the massless goldstone bosons . in the later case ,",
    "the separated spin and electric charge degrees of freedom are re - combined by the confining internal gauge potential .",
    "this implies that there are also electron - like quasiparticles that carry both @xmath205-spin and @xmath206 electric charge .",
    "it is a nontrivial task to estimate their mass since this requires a clear understanding about the mechanism of spin - charge recombination .",
    "the issue of spin - charge recombination has been investigated for many years by several authors @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this issue is not at all clear . in the absence of a reliable theory for spin - charge recombination",
    ", here we assume a constant mass @xmath207 .",
    "further , the @xmath23 bosons can combine with the @xmath208 bosons to form composite spin excitations @xcite .",
    "both the electron - like fermionic quasiparticles and the composite spin excitations are gapped , so their contributions to specific heat and susceptibility ( with respect to real magnetic field @xmath204 , rather than @xmath186 ) are suppressed by their mass gaps @xmath207 and @xmath209 .",
    "at very low temperatures , only the composite goldstone bosons contribute to specific heat ( see equation ( 41 ) ) .",
    "however , although having the same @xmath139-dependence at the point @xmath0 , the magnitude of specific heat in the coulomb phase is much smaller than that at @xmath0 since the contributions from massless @xmath23 bosons and the field @xmath63 all disappear at @xmath6 due to confinement .",
    "in summary , we have studied the possible mass generation of initially massless dirac fermions in a continuum u(1 ) gauge field theory in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "it was found that a dynamical mass is generated when the fermion flavor @xmath20 is less than @xmath2 which has quantitatively different values at the quantum critical point @xmath0 and at @xmath6 .",
    "the gauge potential between charged particles leads to logarithmic confinement when @xmath122 , but at the critical point @xmath0 the matter fields carrying nonzero internal gauge charge are deconfined .",
    "the low - energy properties of the system at @xmath0 are quite different from those at @xmath6 .",
    "we discussed some observable physical quantities , including specific heat and susceptibility , of the system at low temperature and argued that they can be used to judge whether the system stays at the quantum critical point @xmath0 and whether the fermions acquire a dynamical mass .",
    "besides specific heat and susceptibility , the happening of dynamical fermion gap generation can also be readily seen from the transport properties of the system . at very low temperature",
    ", the thermal conductivity is mainly determined by the low - lying fermionic excitations .",
    "if the dirac fermions are massless , then they exhibit universal thermal conductivity , @xmath210 , which is independent of impurity scattering rate @xmath211 @xcite .",
    "once the dirac fermions acquire a dynamical mass @xmath114 , then the thermal conductivity at zero temperature becomes @xmath212 , which is no longer universal and is reduced by the fermion mass @xcite .",
    "if the system is in the clean limit so that @xmath213 , then the thermal conductivity vanishes at very low temperature .",
    "when chiral symmetry is dynamically broken ( no matter @xmath0 or @xmath165 ) , there are no gapless fermionic excitations at low temperature .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath213 the thermal conductivity effectively vanishes at zero temperature and does not have a universal linear term that would exist if the system contains gapless dirac fermions .",
    "the ground state of the system corresponds to an interesting state of matter where the specific heat exhibits behavior of gapless ( bosonic ) excitations but the thermal conductivity has no residual linear term . in two recent works , thermodynamic measurements carried out in @xmath214-(bedt - ttf)@xmath215cu@xmath215(cn)@xmath10 found evidence for the presence of gapless excitations @xcite , while thermal transport measurements carried out in the same material found good evidence supporting the absence of gapless fermionic excitations @xcite .",
    "although it is not known whether the ground state of @xmath214-(bedt - ttf)@xmath215cu@xmath215(cn)@xmath10 can be described by a continuum field theory analogous to the combined action @xmath216 , such seemingly contradicting experimental facts are consistently realized by the chiral symmetry breaking phase of action @xmath216 and can be naturally understood by the mechanism discussed in the context .",
    "the analysis presented above can also be applied to the abelian higgs model , which may be considered as the relativistic version of ginzburg - landau model , with higgs field being the superconducting order parameter .",
    "although the @xmath217 model is distinct in physical contents from the abelian higgs model , its low - energy property bears much resemblance to that of the latter .",
