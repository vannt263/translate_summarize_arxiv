    "the harmonic oscillator is , of course , one of the most basic models in physics , and the noisy harmonic oscillator is a touchstone of statistical physics .",
    "the simplest model of a noisy oscillator is that of an oscillator driven by additive , white noise : @xmath0with white noise @xmath1,@xmath2 which , as is well known , leads to a stationary gaussian distribution for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , whose width is proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "it is also possible to add noise , here multiplicative noise , via external modification of one of the system parameters .",
    "one such a model is that of a harmonic oscillator with random damping strength , @xmath6 : @xmath7 with @xmath8 another white noise .",
    "this equation was first used  @xcite to analyze water waves influenced by a turbulent wind field .",
    "it also can be used to describe , upon replacing @xmath3 and @xmath9 by the order parameter and spatial coordinate , respectively , phase transition dynamics in a moving system  @xcite . here",
    "the first derivative term represents advection by some external flow . in this guise",
    ", the equation has been used to study phase transitions under shear  @xcite , open flows of liquids  @xcite , dendritic growth  @xcite , chemical waves  @xcite and motion of vortices  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to randomly modulate the stiffness parameter , @xmath10 , so that @xmath11 there are also many applications of this model in different fields in physics , such as wave propagation in a random medium @xcite , spin precession in a random external field @xcite , turbulent flow on the ocean surface @xcite , and as well as in biology ( population dynamics @xcite ) , in economics ( stock market prices @xcite ) and so on .",
    "recently , one of us  @xcite considered yet another way of introducing multiplicative noise , namely via a fluctuating mass term . here , as opposed to the other two possibilities outlined above",
    ", the mass term must always be positive , so white noise is ruled out .",
    "one possibility is dichotomous noise , where the mass alternates randomly between two values , @xmath12 . so that the equation reads @xmath13 this model",
    "was originally conceived off in the context of a brownian particle undergoing random adsorption and desorption .",
    "many other applications of an oscillator with a random mass have been considered  @xcite , including ion - ion reactions @xcite - gad1 , electrodeposition @xcite , granular flow @xcite-@xcite , cosmology @xcite-@xcite , film deposition @xcite , traffic jams @xcite-@xcite , and the stock market @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most striking phenomenon of these models with multiplicative noise is the existence of transitions , with no steady state for sufficiently large noise .",
    "it has been traditional in these studies of harmonic oscillators subject to multiplicative noise to scale out the mass , setting it to unity .",
    "this is of course possible , and one can write the critical noise amplitude ( which is dimensionless ) in terms of the dimensionless parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the inverse correlation time of the noise .",
    "( we will discuss the parallel situation in the white noise limit below ) .",
    "however , doing so obscures an important aspect of the physics of the problem ; namely , the nontrivial dependence on the mass .",
    "thus , the mass is an important parameter in a way that it is not in the presence of additive noise only",
    ". one major goal of this work is to consider the mass dependence explicitly .",
    "we will see that in some cases the mass dependence is even nonmonotonic .",
    "in addition , we explore some other features of the problem which seem to have escaped notice .",
    "primary among them is the fact that the statistics of the observables , @xmath3 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are anomalous , with power - law tails . as opposed to models with restabilization at a nonlinear fixed point",
    "@xcite , here there is no cutoff of the power - law at long times .",
    "this is related also to the scale invariance of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "thus , even for parameters for which @xmath19 , say , is finite , higher moments of @xmath18 are infinite in the infinite - time limit .",
    "they are finite at finite time due to the presence of a time - dependent cutoff on the power - law distribution , so that the moments grew exponentially in time .",
    "this behavior is also reflected in a single time trace , with the dynamics having a bursty , intermittent character  @xcite .",
    "the exponent governing the tail of the distribution determines which moments have finite infinite - time limits .",
    "thus the power - law nature of the distribution is intimately related to the infinite series of transitions in the model ,  @xcite corresponding to the onset of convergence of higher and higher moments .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first discuss the mass dependence of the well - known transition corresponding to the divergence of the average energy ( equivalently @xmath20 ) .",
    "we first discuss the case of random damping , where most of the general features are already present .",
    "we then move on to treat the cases of random stiffness and random mass in turn . in the second section ,",
    "we discuss the distribution of the energy and their connection to the infinite set of transitions for different moments . in the last section we present our conclusions .",
    "we first discuss the case of random damping .",
    "we work in the framework of symmetric dichotomous noise , recovering the white - noise case by taking the small correlation time , large amplitude limit .",
    "thus the damping @xmath21 switches randomly in a poisson fashion between two values , @xmath22 .",
    "if both @xmath22 are positive , there is of course no instability .",
    "however , a negative @xmath23 by itself is not enough to ensure instability .",
    "the basic starting point of the analysis is the equations of motion of the second moments .",
    "these moment equation can be derived either from the langevin equation or from a fokker - planck formalism .",
    "the former method was presented , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the fokker - planck formalism",
    ", we construct two coupled fokker - planck equations for the probability density @xmath24 , conditioned on the value of @xmath21 .",
    "the equations read @xmath25 here , the diffusion constant @xmath26 is related to the strength of the additive noise and @xmath16 is the decay rate of the correlator of the dichotomous noise , and is inversely proportional to the average switching time , @xmath27 , by @xmath28 .",
    "from these two equations , it is easy to generate a closed set of moment equations for the six conditioned quantities , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the equations read @xmath32 these are , of course , equivalent to the moment equations arising from the langevin equation . setting the time derivatives to zero and",
    "solving yields @xmath33 setting the mass to unity yields the result presented in earlier works .",
    "alternatively , our present result can be reconstructed from the standard , @xmath34 result by the substitutions @xmath35    it is clear that as long as @xmath22 are both positive , @xmath20 is positive , and there is no instability .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite @xmath20 in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , yielding @xmath38    let us first consider the white noise limit : @xmath39 where @xmath20 reduces to @xmath40 here the critical noise amplitude is @xmath41 , beyond which no steady - state exists .",
    "this critical noise amplitude is proportional to the mass , so that low mass systems are more unstable .",
    "turning now to the general dichotomous system , we see that the numerator is positive definite , while the denominator is negative for sufficiently large @xmath42 .",
    "the critical @xmath42 is @xmath43 it can be checked that @xmath44 and increases monotonically with @xmath45 , diverging for large @xmath45 as @xmath46 , in accord with our white noise limit result .",
    "this implies that for any given @xmath47 , the system is unstable for small @xmath45 and is stable for @xmath48 , where the critical @xmath45 , @xmath49 , increases with @xmath36 .",
    "the instability boundary is indicated by the upper curve in fig .",
    "[ gam_bound ] ( the other curves will be discussed below in sec .",
    "we thus see that for the dichotomous noise limit , the mass dependence is quite complicated .",

    "@xcite , an equivalent way to demonstrate the instability is to examine the dynamics of the system without external additive driving @xmath54 .",
    "then , the system eqs .",
    "( [ sys ] ) is a homogenous linear system characterized by a @xmath55 matrix . as usual",
    ", the presence of positive eigenvalues corresponds to existence of an instability , which yields precisely the same stability criterion as given above .",
    "we now turn to the case where the spring stiffness , @xmath10 , varies between two values , @xmath56 .",
    "the fokker - planck equation and the resulting moment equations are directly parallel to the previous case , and the steady - state solution is @xmath57}{(32\\gamma m \\lambda + 64\\gamma^2 ) k_+k_-+(24\\gamma^2m\\lambda^2 + 4\\gamma m^2\\lambda^3 + 32\\gamma^3\\lambda)(k_++k_-)-(k_+-k_-)^2m^2\\lambda^2}\\ ] ] as before , this result can be recovered from the standard @xmath34 version by the substitutions given in eq .",
    "( [ subs ] ) .",
    "the first thing to note is that , as opposed to the previous case , here the denominator can be negative even if @xmath56 are both positive .",
    "this is due to the fact that changing for @xmath58 to @xmath59 increases the energy of the system , and even though the reverse transition decreases the energy , the two do not have to balance . rewriting things in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath36 , with @xmath60 ,",
    "yields @xmath61 in the white noise limit , this reduces to @xmath62 thus in the white noise limit , the system is unstable for @xmath63 _ independent _ of the mass , as opposed to the case of the white noise random damping .    reverting to the general dichotomous case , we find that the critical @xmath64 above which the instability sets in is @xmath65 in general , this function is not monotonic in @xmath45 .",

    "the upshot of this is that for large damping , @xmath70 , the system is stable for @xmath76 , independent of mass , while for larger @xmath42 , the system is stable only above some critical value of @xmath45 which increases with @xmath42 . for smaller",
    "damping , the situation is more complex . for intermediate damping ,",
    "@xmath72 , the system is always stable independent of @xmath45 for @xmath77 . for @xmath78 ,",

    "recently  @xcite , a model in which the mass term randomly fluctuates was studied . in this case , it is clearly important that the fluctuations do not change the sign of the mass term , which rules out the possibility of white noise .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to consider the case of dichotomous noise where the  mass \" fluctuates between two values , @xmath12 .",

    "for example , in the case of a random inductance , the charge and current are conserved at the moment of the fluctuation . for the case of a random moment of inertia",

    "thus , these two cases lead to two different mathematical models , one which reads @xmath94 and the second which reads @xmath95 in the first , continuous velocity , case , which was the case studied in refs .",

    "the same is true for the instability conditions for the higher - order moments .",
    "there is yet a third possible model .",

    "examining the how the distribution of @xmath117 changes with time is very instructive .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ power_m1 ] that the distribution is characterized by a power - law tail which is cut off beyond some value of @xmath18 , a value which increases with time .",
    "given that in the absence of such a cutoff the mean value of @xmath18 would diverge ( the power is smaller than 2 in magnitude ) , the mean is strongly time - dependent , as the moment equations predict .",
    "a similar phenomenon happens for a random walk in a logarithmic potential  @xcite , where the distribution of position also has a time - dependent cutoff ( that in that case grows as the square - root of time ) .",

    "in fact , kubo in his paper introduced two models , one of which is described by the kubo equation @xmath142 where @xmath143 , and @xmath54 is a fluctuating noise term .",
