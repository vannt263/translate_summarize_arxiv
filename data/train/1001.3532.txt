    "fractals @xcite occur ubiquitously in nature and appear to arise in many different ways ; examples from the physical and biological sciences include colloidal flocculation@xcite , percolation phenomena@xcite and the structure of transport networks in organisms@xcite . in the area of structural mechanics",
    ", it has been claimed that the fractal morphology of trabecular bone is responsible in part for its mechanical efficiency @xcite ; while the complex suture patterns of ammonites of the jurassic and cretaceous periods have been conjectured to give greater strength to their shells@xcite .",
    "recent theoretical work on a highly simplified model system consisting of a brittle pressure - bearing plate has also suggested that a fractal structure can be highly efficient when the loading conditions are very gentle and the material very brittle @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to explore other circumstances under which fractal design principles can lead to high mechanical efficiency , in case there is a general theorem underlying the optimal design of elastic structures under gentle compressive loading . to this end , we consider here the buckling behaviour of compression members .",
    "consider first the classical case of an euler strut @xcite in the form of a solid , cylindrical column of radius @xmath7 and length @xmath0 , made from an isotropic , linear elastic material of young modulus @xmath1 and poisson ratio @xmath8 , and subject to a compressive force @xmath3 at the freely hinged ends .",
    "we define two non - dimensional parameters : @xmath9 , which is the compressive force scaled by @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , which is the volume of material used , scaled by @xmath12 .",
    "we are interested in the regime of gentle loading , by which we mean @xmath5 and @xmath13 .",
    "because of euler buckling , the strut can only withstand forces such that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the second moment of the cross sectional area about the neutral axis of the beam @xcite .",
    "therefore the ( non - dimensionalised ) volume of material required to withstand a load represented by @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where we have neglected the material required to make the freely hinged couplings at the ends of the strut .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we call the above solid strut a `` generation @xmath18 '' structure , and this is written as an argument for the volume variable @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ euler ] ) .",
    "we note in passing that the contrast in efficiency between compression members and tension members ( for which @xmath20 ) is a persistent theme in structural engineering .",
    "the scaling of eq .",
    "( [ euler ] ) plus the cost of couplings mean that efficient structures tend to have few compression members and many long tension members ; the paradigmatic example being a tent @xcite .    to define a @xmath21 structure , we choose a hollow cylindrical shell , which is also a classic problem in elasticity theory @xcite .",
    "we choose the length as always to be @xmath0 , and we denote the radius by @xmath22 where the first index refers to the `` generation number '' @xmath21 and the second index will be explained when we describe structures of higher generation number .",
    "this @xmath21 structure consists of one cylinder parallel to the compression direction , and we express this trivial fact by @xmath23 .",
    "the thickness of the sheet of elastic material making up the curved surface of the cylindrical shell is denoted by @xmath24 , which specifically represents the volume of material required to make unit area of the curved surface .",
    "we call this quantity the `` material thickness '' of the curved sheet .",
    "we also introduce an `` effective elastic thickness '' @xmath25 for the curved sheet . for the generation 1 structure ,",
    "the curved sheet is simple in topology and uniform in thickness , and so @xmath26 .",
    "lastly we have an effective young modulus @xmath27 and poisson ratio @xmath28 for the sheet . for a @xmath21 structure @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in all of these expressions",
    ", the first index refers to the generation number , and the second index will take values from @xmath31 up to the generation number of the structure , as will be explained in section [ generation2 ] .    provided that @xmath32 , the column now has a second moment of cross sectional area about the neutral axis given by @xmath33 and the volume of material used to construct it is given by @xmath34 .",
    "the requirement that euler buckling not occur then imposes the constraint @xmath35 or @xmath36    in contrast to the solid column , there is now the possibility of local buckling .",
    "this happens when @xcite @xmath37 which provides a second constraint on the structure required to support a force @xmath3 .    the generation @xmath31 structure with the highest mechanical efficiency ( smallest value of @xmath19 for a given @xmath16 )",

    "( [ v1 ] ) represents a considerable gain in efficiency over the solid column of eq .",
    "( [ euler ] ) , but does not rival the efficiency ( @xmath20 ) which can be obtained for tensile loading .",
    "we note that both here and in all subsequent sections , we have taken a conservative approach in calculating @xmath19 , by assuming that the structure fails when the first buckling bifurcation is encountered .",
    "engineering structures ( especially shells ) will often support considerably higher loads in the post - buckling regime before catastrophic failure @xcite .",
    "although such complexities are certainly of practical importance , we choose to ignore them in this investigation and try , where possible , to obtain estimates which are upper bounds for @xmath19 .",
    "when designing a plate or shell which may buckle , it is standard engineering practice to introduce stiffening plates , longitudinal stringers , bulkheads , or similar devices in order to stiffen the structure and/or suppress buckling modes @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we take a similar approach , but re - design the structure in a systematic and hierarchical manner , which can be iterated in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "we do not presume to do this in the most efficient manner ( we are almost certainly over - engineering the protection against many of the buckling modes we wish to avoid ) but nevertheless the design we describe allows us to systematically change the scaling of @xmath19 with @xmath16 and therefore to approach more closely the scaling which can be achieved for a rod under tension ; achieving ultimately @xmath42 $ ] . in the limit @xmath41 , this is smaller than any scaling of the form @xmath43 with @xmath44 .    to proceed in this direction ,",
    "consider first of all a simple thin , flat plate of uniform thickness @xmath45 , lying in the @xmath46 plane and made out of an isotropic elastic material of young modulus @xmath47 and poisson ratio @xmath48 .",
    "suppose furthermore that this plate may be deformed by applied stresses , leading to stretching or shearing of the middle plane@xcite , and also possibly to out - of - plane deflections which may be large compared to the plate thickness .",
    "an appropriate approximation to describe the behaviour of the plate is due to von karman @xcite . in this theory , the equilibrium behaviour ( given suitable boundary conditions )",
    "can be obtained by minimising an energy functional .",
    "the elastic part of the energy ( as opposed to that from external forces ) can be written as the sum of two terms @xcite : the energy @xmath49 associated with stretching of the middle plane of the plate , and a bending energy @xmath50 .",
    "if the 2-dimensional strain tensor for the middle plane of the plate is given by @xmath51 , then the stretching energy will be given by @xcite @xmath52 ^ 2+(1-\\tilde{\\nu}){\\rm tr}({\\rm e}^2)\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    furthermore , if the plate is bent out - of - plane in the @xmath53-direction , by an amount @xmath54 , then the bending energy stored will be given by @xcite @xmath55 ^ 2 - 2(1-\\tilde{\\nu}){\\rm det}(h)\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the hessian matrix @xmath57     bottom image is part of a composite plate , which is constructed by merging the three substructures shown in the top three images of the figure .",

    "the three sub - structures are identical save for being rotated by @xmath58 radians relative to one another about an axis perpendicular to the plane .",
    "each right circular cylinder has a radius @xmath59 , a wall thickness @xmath60 and is infinitely long.,width=240 ]    now consider the composite plate shown in the bottom part of fig .",
    "[ plate3 ] .",
    "this structure is built from three intersecting sub - structures ( as shown separately in the top three parts of fig .",
    "[ plate3 ] ) , each identical , save for being rotated @xmath58 radians relative to one another . where the sub - structures pass through one another , we imagine them being joined or welded along their curves of intersection .",
    "each sub - structure consists of an infinite set of parallel hollow right circular cylinders , with their axes in the @xmath46 plane , and placed so that each touches two neighbours and is welded to each of its two neighbours along these lines of contact ( which also lie in the @xmath46 plane ) .",
    "we specify all these welds so we can be sure that on deformation at long length scales , the plate behaves as a single entity , rather than separating into its constituent cylinders .",
    "each of the component cylinders has a radius @xmath59 and a wall thickness @xmath60 .",
    "because we have chosen the composite plate to have six - fold rotational symmetry about the @xmath53-axis , then on long enough length scales the composite plate must behave elastically as though it is isotropic under rotations about the @xmath53-axis .",
    "this is because to leading order , the elastic stiffness of the plate under stretching and bending is represented by rank 4 tensors in two dimensions ( which are contracted with two dimensional rank 2 deformation tensors to form the scalar energy ) .",
    "these rank 4 elastic tensors may be invariant under rotation about the @xmath53-axis ( and so be consistent with any rotation group @xmath61 ) , or may have one of the symmetry groups @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "however the composite plate we have described has the symmetry group @xmath64 , which is not consistent with @xmath62 or @xmath63 .    calculating the stretching and bending energies of the composite plate shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ plate3 ] is non - trivial even for the long - wavelength ( much greater than @xmath59 ) deformations in which we are interested .",
    "indeed , obtaining the correct numerical pre - factors would require a finite element calculation for the structure .",
    "instead , and in order to proceed rigorously and in an analytical manner , we make an approximation which under - estimates the stiffness ( over - estimates the compliance ) of the structure , so that we would end up eventually with an upper bound on the minimum value of @xmath19 required for the final columns in the sections to follow .    the approximation we make is a `` ghost approximation '' , in which we imagine that the cylinders composing the composite plate of fig .",

    "( [ uscom ] ) and ( [ ubcom ] ) with those for a uniform plate ( eqs .",
    "( [ us ] ) and ( [ ub ] ) ) then we see that for long wavelength deformations , the plate is at least as stiff as a uniform plate with effective thickness , young modulus and poisson ratio given by @xmath77    furthermore , the composite plate uses an amount of material per unit area given by @xmath78    the results in eqs .",
    "( [ teff ] ) , ( [ yeff ] ) and ( [ nueff ] ) provide us with the information required to calculate lower limits on the stresses required to produce buckling on length scales much larger than @xmath59",
    ". however , a composite plate of this kind can also fail through local buckling by one or more of the constituent cylinders undergoing a local buckling instability .",
    "this can be dealt with analytically for an isolated cylinder , which is the result used above for local buckling of a generation @xmath31 structure ( eq .",
    "( [ koiter ] ) ) .",
    "however , without an extensive finite element study , covering a range of parameters , it is much harder to provide a good lower bound on the in - plane compressional stress required to excite these modes in the composite plate .",
    "this is because the stresses in intersecting cylinders could potentially generate buckling , rather than having no effect ( as in the ghost approximation ) or suppressing these modes .    in what follows",
    ", we will make the simple , but not necessarily accurate approximation that provided the largest compressive principal stress component lies in the direction of the axes of one of the substructures in the composite plate , then we will get local buckling only under the same circumstances as for an isolated cylinder .",
    "this is also a kind of `` ghost '' approximation , in that the role of the other parts of the substructure are ignored , but although it is plausibly a conservative approximation , it no longer provides a strict bound on @xmath19 .",
