    "the simplest model of predator - prey interactions was first developed independently by alfred j. lotka @xcite and vito volterra @xcite .",
    "the classical two - dimensional lotka - volterra equation is given by : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of some predator ( for example , wolves ) , @xmath2 is the number of its prey ( for example , rabbits ) and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are real parameters representing the interaction of the two species .",
    "this system and its extensions have been fully studied before by several researchers @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite introduced the fractional - order lotka - volterra predator - prey system : @xmath6 for some positive real constants @xmath7 , and @xmath8 $ ] , and studied the stability of its equilibrium points ( see section [ sec_back ] for the definition of fractional - order operators ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study a more general form of the fractional - order lotka - volterra equation ( as defined in ( [ lotka1 ] ) ) in which the order of fractional derivatives are assumed to be different in general .",
    "such a model may be used for better modelling and understanding the behavior of more complicated predator - pray systems .    currently , nonlinear fractional - order systems constitute a challenging research area , mainly because some powerful classical tools such as the lyapunov s stability method can not directly be applied to these systems .",
    "it is also a well - understood fact that determining the domain of attraction of stable equilibrium points of nonlinear fractional - order systems is not a straightforward task .",
    "the main reason for this difficulty is that the phase portrait of these systems can not be plotted using the so - called isoclines .",
    "the long - memory principle of the fractional - order operators leads to some strange behaviors which are also discussed in this paper .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "three kinds of definitions are widely used to define fractional - order derivatives : grnwald - letnikov derivative , riemann - liouville derivative and caputo derivative @xcite .",
    "these three definitions are in general not equivalent .",
    "the definition of the fractional derivative given by caputo has the advantage of only requiring initial conditions given in terms of integer - order derivatives .",
