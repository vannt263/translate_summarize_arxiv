    "baryon number violation is a very sensitive probe of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "interactions which violate baryon number ( @xmath8 ) are not present in the renormalizable part of the sm lagrangian , but they can arise as effective higher dimensional operators .",
    "the lowest @xmath8violating operators @xcite have @xmath9 and are suppressed by two powers of an inverse mass scale .",
    "these operators are realized naturally when sm is embedded in a grand unified theory ( gut ) such as @xmath10 and @xmath0 upon integrating out the heavy vector gauge bosons and colored scalar bosons .",
    "they lead to the decay of the nucleon into modes such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "present experimental limits on nucleon lifetime constrain the masses of the mediators ( vector gauge boson or scalar bosons ) to be larger than about @xmath13 gev , which is close to the unification scale determined from the approximate meeting of the three gauge couplings when extrapolated to higher energies .",
    "an interesting feature of the @xmath9 baryon number violating operators is that they conserve baryon number minus lepton number ( @xmath14 ) symmetry , leading to the selection rule @xmath15 for nucleon decay@xcite .",
    "thus , observation of any decays which violate @xmath15 rule would hint at new dynamics different from those responsible for the @xmath9 operators .",
    "decay modes in this category include @xmath3 , @xmath16 etc , which all obey the selection rule @xmath17 .",
    "observation of these decay modes would thus furnish evidence against the simple gut picture with one step breaking to the sm .",
    "in this paper we study the next  to ",
    "leading @xmath18 operators , which obey the selection rule @xmath19 for nucleon decay @xcite , and show that they arise naturally within @xmath0 grand unified theories . in non ",
    "supersymmetric @xmath0 models with an intermediate scale we find the nucleon lifetime for decay modes such as @xmath20 to be within reach of ongoing and proposed experiments .",
    "we also identify susy @xmath0 models where these decays may be within reach , consistent with gauge coupling unification . while we focus mainly on renormalizable @xmath0 models with @xmath4 of higgs bosons employed for rank reduction",
    ", we show that our results also hold for models with @xmath5 used for this purpose .",
    "the second main result of this paper is a mechanism for generating the baryon asymmetry of the universe at the gut epoch .",
    "the way it comes about is as follows .",
    "there are heavy scalar bosons and gauge bosons in @xmath0 theories which generate the @xmath18 operators .",
    "these particles have @xmath1violating two  body decays , which can generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe naturally , as we show here .",
    "this would not be possible in the case of @xmath1preserving decays of gut scale particles such as the ones in @xmath10 .",
    "although grand unified theories were thought to be the natural stage for implementing the sakharov s conditions for baryogenesis @xcite up until the mid-1980 s @xcite , this idea was practically abandoned after the realization that the sphalerons @xcite , which violate @xmath21 symmetry , would erase any baryon asymmetry that obeyed the @xmath22 selection rule .",
    "this is because the effective interactions generated by sphalerons , the non - perturbative configuration of the weak interactions , are in thermal equilibrium for temperatures in the range @xmath23 gev , and violate @xmath24 symmetry .",
    "however , if baryon asymmetry was generated by @xmath1violating decays of gut scale particles , they would be immune to sphaleron destruction .",
    "we show that this mechanism of baryogenesis , which also induces the @xmath18 @xmath8violating operators , is very efficient and occurs quite generically in @xmath0 models . in minimal models",
    "there is a tight connection between the induced baryon asymmetry and the masses of quarks , leptons and the neutrinos .",
    "we also note that the minimal renormalizable versions of these models @xcite have been extremely successful in describing neutrino masses and mixings @xcite , and in particular predicted relatively large value for the neutrino mixing angle @xmath25 , which is consistent with recent results from daya bay , t2k , double - chooz and minos experiments @xcite .",
    "the results of the present paper show that these models can also explain the observed baryon asymmetry in a manner closely connected to the neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we discuss the @xmath18 @xmath8 and @xmath1violating operators . in sec .",
    "3 we show how these operators arise in unified @xmath0 theories , both in the non - supersymmetric version and in the susy version . in sec .",
    "4 we address nucleon decay lifetime for the @xmath1violating modes in @xmath0 models with an intermediate scale .",
    "5 is devoted to gut scale baryogenesis mechanism tied to the @xmath18 operators . here",
    "we show the close connection between baryon asymmetry and fermion masses and mixings . finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "we begin by recalling the leading baryon number violating operators in the standard model which have @xmath9 .",
    "there are five such operators with baryon number @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath27 here we have not shown the color contractions ( which is unique in each term via @xmath28 ) , and we have suppressed the flavor indices .",
    "we have followed the standard notation for fermion fields with all fields being left  handed .",

    "an interesting feature of the @xmath9 baryon number violating operators on eq .",
    "( [ dim6 ] ) is that they all carry lepton number @xmath34 along with @xmath35 .",
    "consequently these operators preserve @xmath1 .",
    "thus nucleon decay mediated by these operators would obey the selection rule @xmath36 .",
    "the decays @xmath37 and @xmath38 would be allowed by this selection rule , while decays such as @xmath39 and @xmath20 , which require @xmath17 would be forbidden .",
    "grand unified theories based on @xmath10 and @xmath0 gauge symmetries generate the operators of eq .",
    "( [ dim6 ] ) suppressed by two inverse powers of gut scale masses . with the gut scale near @xmath13 gev , as suggested by the approximate unification of the three gauge couplings , these operators lead to nucleon lifetimes of order @xmath40 years for @xmath1 conserving modes , which are in the range that is currently being probed by experiments .",
    "discovery of nucleon decay into @xmath17 channels such as @xmath41 would however suggest that the underlying dynamics is quite different from that of the @xmath9 effective operators of eq .",
    "( [ dim6 ] ) .    as already noted in the introduction ,",
    "while gut scale particles can generate a baryon asymmetry in their @xmath8violating decays , it was realized that interactions of the electroweak sphalerons would wash out any such asymmetry that conserves @xmath1 .",
    "gut scale baryogenesis thus went out of fashion after the discovery of sphalerons .",
    "this was also in part due to the leptogenesis mechanism @xcite discovered soon thereafter , which can elegantly explain the observed baryon asymmetry with a connection to the small neutrino masses induced via the seesaw mechanism@xcite .",
    "now we turn to the next  to  leading @xmath8violating operators beyond those of eq . ( [ dim6 ] ) , which are of dimension seven .",
    "these operators are interesting in that they carry @xmath42 @xcite .",

    "we also find that these operators may lead to observable @xmath1 violating nucleon decay .",

    "( [ dim6 ] ) .",
    "however , as we show below , in unified theories based on @xmath0 with an intermediate scale , these decays may be accessible to experiments .",
    "most interestingly , these operators can naturally generate baryon asymmetry of the universe at the gut scale , which is facilitated by the fact that the electroweak sphaleron interactions do not wash out a @xmath1 asymmetry generated at such a scale .    in the supersymmetric version of the standard model , baryon number violation can arise through operators in the superpotential analogous to eq .",
