    "the recent discovery of topological insulators @xcite has realized a long - sought opportunity of implementing exotic quantum phenomenon in practical materials .",
    "@xcite however , existing topological materials are restricted to binary and ternary compositions of heavy elements@xcite , which limits the possibility of combining correlated electronic , magnetic , superconducting and other local order properties with topological phenomenon .",
    "it is highly desirable , therefore , to expand the menu of available materials into the domain of compounds which are relevant for device fabrication with tuning capabilities and accessible crystalline cleavage .",
    "topological insulator order and local order of spontaneous symmetry breaking such as magnetism and superconductivity has recently been classified in different spatial dimensions and with different discrete symmetries .",
    "the band topology in the two - dimensional quantum spin - hall effect or three dimensional non - trivial topological insulators are required to possess a time - reversal invariant number @xmath4 = -1",
    ". materials with strong spin - orbit coupling can host non - trivial topological phases in both two and three spatial dimensions when the time - reversal symmetry remains invariant .",
    "the topological insulating materials realized to date are based on the binary and ternary combinations of mostly heavy metals ranging from hgte,@xcite bi / sb - based binary systems@xcite to tl - based ternary compounds@xcite .",
    "however , the principle allure of topological insulators stems from their potential technological applications , which require the time - reversal - invariant topological ground state to be placed along with the broken symmetry of local orders.@xcite of particular interest are the magnetic atom doped topological insulators for realizing effects of magnetic impurities and ferromagnetism on the topological surface states.@xcite furthermore , the realization of elementary excitations that satisfy non - abelian statistics @xmath5 the so - called majorana fermions , important for topological quantum computers , requires proximity of superconducting and ferromagnetic insulating phases.@xcite therefore , it is important to search for material classes which provide more chemical and structural flexibility to tune the ground state properties using cross - substitution of elements .    here",
    ", we report the theoretical prediction of three dimensional topological insulator in the pristine state of existing materials in quaternary chalcogenide compounds which are made of i@xmath0-ii - iv - vi@xmath1 compositions and in ternary compositions of i@xmath2-v - vi@xmath1 famatinite compounds .",
    "both families are related by cross - substitutions of cations in the underlying tetragonal structure .",
    "quaternary semiconductors , especially , exhibit more flexible properties arising from their enhanced chemical and structural freedom and provide a handle on the surface quantum control through the large possibility of substitution with the magnetic , non - magnetic and other correlated electronic elements . through the ternary - to - quaternary mutation and control of the atomic configuration , one can perform band engineering to tailor the topological quantum phenomenon for transport and quantum information processing application .",
    "we begin the discussion with the ternary composition of i@xmath2-v - vi@xmath1 compounds which are known to crystallize in famanitine structures and are basically of the sphalerite - type .",
    "these materials belong to the space group @xmath6 , in which the group vi atoms are surrounded by three group i and one group v elements . as a result",
    ", they obey the octet rule and form a ( i - vi)@xmath2(v - vi ) superlattice structure , see fig .",
    "1(a ) for cu@xmath2sbse@xmath1 as an example .",
    "in contrast to the high - symmetry zinc - blende sublattice of ternary compounds@xcite , famatinite structure naturally achieves a tetragonal lattice distortion along the @xmath7axis ( @xmath8 ) due to the turning on of the strong interlayer coupling between the two cation planes .",
    "this also results in a mismatch between the cation - anion bond lengths in two zinc - blende formula units of the unit cell which helps lower the total energy of the famatinite ground state phase .",
    "* crystal structure and the property of the topological band - inversion . * ( a ) , the crystal structure of ternary famatinite compounds is given for a representative material cu@xmath9sbse@xmath10 .",

    "band inversion occurs when s - like states drops below the four - fold degenerate @xmath12like states @xmath13 ( blue lines ) .",
    "owing to the lattice distortion , the degeneracy of the @xmath14 states vanishes in the present non - cubic crystal structures.,width=321 ]    famatinite compounds i@xmath2-v - vi@xmath1 evolve to the quaternary chalcogenides i@xmath0-ii - iv - vi@xmath1 , when one of the group - i element of the former compounds is replaced by one group - ii element and the group - v element is changed to group - iv element ; see fig .",
    "1(b ) for example cu@xmath0cdsbse@xmath1 .",
    "high - resolution transmission electron microscopy and x - ray diffraction analysis shows that these materials have tetragonal crystallographic structure which belongs to @xmath15 space group . the structure can be described by a ( i - ii)@xmath0(ii - vi)(iv - vi ) sublattice of the two zinc - blende formula units as before.@xcite the substitution of larger atoms in the tetragonal basis of these systems helps expand the lattice and thus both the tetragonal distortion and the crystal - field splitting increases considerably .",
    "although these changes are relatively small , nevertheless , quaternary chalcogenides have more structural freedom and more complicated electronic and chemical properties than their binary or ternary counterparts .",
    "the typical topological phases can be classified as trivial band insulator , a non - trivial topological semimetal ( zero - bandgap ) and a non - trivial topological insulator(finite - bandgap ) .",
    "the corresponding band symmetries near @xmath3 point are expressed schematically in fig .",
    "1c - e respectively . for a trivial topological phase with the @xmath16 topological order equal to + 1 in a zinc - blende crystal such as cdte",
    ", a bandgap exists at the fermi - level as well as the twofold degenerate @xmath11like states marked by darked - blue dot lies in the conduction band . in a non - trivial topological phase case such as hgte ,",
    "band inversion occurs whereas @xmath11like states drop below the fourfold degenerate @xmath12like states of @xmath14 multiplet , with @xmath16=-1 .",
    "the fourfold degeneracy is due to the cubic symmetry in the zinc - blende structure . to achieve a topological insulating state , the degeneracy is required to be lifted and a band gap is opened ( fig.1(e ) ) .",
    "since the non - cubic famatinites and quaternary chalcogenides are derived from zinc - blende structures , the non - trivial topological insulating phase could be realized in these materials .",
    "indeed , our first - principles calculations predict that 3d non - trivial topological insulating phase exists in the compounds of famatinite and quaternary chalcogenides families .",
    "the crystal structures of ternary famatinite compounds and quaternary chalcogenide compounds are taken from literature @xcite .",
    "first - principles band calculations were performed with the linear augmented - plane - wave ( lapw ) method using the wien2k package @xcite in the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) . the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof @xcite",
    "was used to describe the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "spin orbital coupling ( soc ) was included as a second variational step using a basis of scalar - relativistic eigenfunctions .",
    "the bulk band structures along high symmetry path @xmath17 are shown in fig .  2 for two representative compunds cu@xmath2sbs@xmath1 and cu@xmath2sbse@xmath1 which belong to the famatinite family .",
    "the effect of the zone - folding is clearly evident at the high - symmetry point @xmath3 . in the ground state of these compounds ,",
    "the structural compression along c - axis ( i.e. @xmath8 ) compared to cubic zinc - blende lattice lifts the four - fold degeneracy of the cation @xmath12states at the @xmath18point owing to the crystal - field splitting . in cu@xmath2sbs@xmath1 , an insulating energy gap between the @xmath12states is present at the fermi level throughout the brillouin zone as shown in fig .",
    "however , as the nuclear charge of the anion is increased from s atom to se atom , such substitution causes the conduction band to drop below the fermi level at the x - point , yielding an electron pocket , see fig .",
    "simultaneously , the valence band maximum also gradually moves above the fermi - level making cu@xmath2sbse@xmath1 a metal .",
    "nevertheless , a finite direct gap persists throughout the brillouin zone and thus the @xmath16 topological invariant can still be defined for the valence bands in these two materials and the inverted band order is retained at only @xmath18points .",

    "the gray shadings highlight the low - energy region near @xmath18point where the inverted band - inversion has occurred .",
    ", width=207 ]    the mutation of the crystal structure from the ternary to a quaternary compound is also evident in the electronic structure of these two families of materials as the overall changes in the electronic structure are only subtle near the energy region of present interests . due to the tetragonal symmetry , all the cu - based quaternary materials listed in fig .",
    "3 host a gap in the @xmath12states close to the fermi - level , where the gap magnitude depends on the extra cation cross - substitutions . with increasing atomic mass from zn to cd to hg atom , this gap decreases mainly due to the downshift of the @xmath11like conduction bands at @xmath18point .",
    "the fermi - level goes through the energy gap of the @xmath12states in most materials , harboring a topological insulating state in these compounds .",
    "however , only in two compounds cu@xmath0zngete@xmath1 and cu@xmath0cdgete@xmath1 , the low - energy electronic properties reveal that the conduction band minimum is shifted to the @xmath19 point and drops below the fermi level to form bulk electron pockets .",
    "simultaneously , the concave - upward shaped valence band maximum pops up above the fermi level at @xmath18point , making these systems intrinsically bulk metallic .",
    "we find very similar nature of the band - inversion across these materials in which the split @xmath12states lie in energy above the twofold - degenerate @xmath11 states at a single time - reversal momentum @xmath18point , representing a band - inversion relative to the natural order of @xmath11and @xmath12type orbital derived band structure .",
    "therefore , these materials are intrinsically bulk non - trivial topological insulators or semimetals , except cu@xmath0znges@xmath1 , cu@xmath0znsns@xmath1 , and cu@xmath0hgges@xmath1 which are trivial topological insulators .",

    ", we also pay attention to the lattice constant and the internal displacements of the anion by keeping the same ratio of changes corresponding to the change in @xmath27 of atomic number zs from cu@xmath21znsns@xmath10 to cu@xmath2sbs@xmath1 .",
    "note that variation of the atomic number @xmath22s can also be considered as a doping effect in the virtual crystal approximation while the total nuclear charge is neutral during the whole process .",
