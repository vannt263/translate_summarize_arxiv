    "the evaluation of radiative corrections in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) plays an important role in our understanding of its phenomenological implications .",
    "this is of particular interest , the mssm being , at the moment , the most promising extension of the standard model ( sm ) for the strong and electroweak interactions .",
    "finite corrections to supersymmetric ward identities , such as those associated with higgs boson masses and couplings @xcite , have a direct impact on the model predictions .",
    "the remaining corrections have more subtle phenomenological implications , since they can be largely reabsorbed into redefinition of the many arbitrary parameters of the mssm .",
    "this is no longer true , however , if one embeds the model into a more fundamental theory ( as superguts , supergravities or superstrings ) where some or all of the mssm parameters can be predicted .    in this paper",
    "we compute the one - loop corrections to the masses of the top quark , the stop squarks and the gluino , going beyond the leading - log approximation .",
    "we present explicit analytical formulae , keeping in the feynman rules only the vertices proportional to the strong coupling constant @xmath1 and to the top yukawa coupling @xmath2 .",
    "this approximation should reproduce the main contributions to the one - loop radiative corrections . comparing our full one - loop results with the renormalization - group - improved tree - level masses",
    ", we find that there can be significant differences , also in the case of `` natural '' choices for the renormalization scale .",
    "the corrections can be particularly relevant for the lightest stop eigenstate and for a very light gluino . in the top quark case ,",
    "we find that the extra corrections due to loops of supersymmetric particles can be non - negligible compared to the pure qcd ones .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in this section , we introduce the notation by giving the top , stop and gluino tree - level mass formulae ; in section [ sec : loop ] we introduce the renormalization procedure , we recall the relation between running and pole masses , and we give the main points of our calculations ; in section [ sec : nume ] we discuss the numerical results and their phenomenological implications . the complete results for the one - loop - corrected top , stop and gluino masses are presented in appendix a. the explicit solutions of the one - loop renormalization group equations for all the parameters of relevance to our calculations , in the approximation where the only non - zero dimensionless couplings are @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are reported in appendix b.    the mssm @xcite contains three generations of quark ( @xmath3 ) and lepton ( @xmath4 ) chiral superfields ( @xmath5 ) , and two higgs chiral superfields ( @xmath6 ) , with interactions specified by an @xmath7-parity - invariant superpotential and a collection of soft supersymmetry - breaking terms . as often done in the literature , we shall assume real mass parameters and neglect all yukawa couplings apart from the top quark one .",
    "the tree - level expressions for the different masses and couplings in the mssm are well known : in the following , we shall use the notation and conventions of @xcite , including the reversal of the sign of @xmath8 in the squark sector as specified in the errata @xcite .",

    "our conventional ordering of the eigenvalues ( namely , @xmath20 ) is obtained with the prescription that @xmath17 should have the same sign as the combination @xmath21 .    summarizing , at the tree level the top , stop and gluino masses are functions of the following independent input parameters : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , other parameters will appear via the one - loop corrections .",

    "up to higher - order corrections , the pole masses do not depend on the scale or on the renormalization scheme .",
    "to evaluate the corrections to the pole masses of the stops , we need to study the corrected inverse propagator matrix @xmath28 . in the ( @xmath29 ) basis , where @xmath30 are the tree - level eigenstates ,",
