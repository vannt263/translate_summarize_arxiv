    "<S> the appearance of zero and secondary maximum in @xmath48 at intermediate values of @xmath6 is the direct consequence of the change of sign of the experimental @xmath40 phase shifts at intermediate energies . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to calculate that the model s @xmath49 , which decreases monotonically with @xmath50 and is always positive ( @xmath51 for all @xmath50 ) , immediately leads to monotonically decreasing with @xmath6 values of @xmath48 without any fine structure .    </S>",
    "<S> \\2 . </S>",
    "<S> almost up to the point of zero ( @xmath52 of @xmath48 the total relativistic correction ( trc ) , _ i.e. _ , the difference between @xmath5 calculated relativistically ( 1,2 ) and its nonrelativistic limit , is positive and appears to be not small . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath53 it reaches the value of 25% .    </S>",
    "<S> \\3 . </S>",
    "<S> trc becomes large in the region of the secondary maximum of @xmath48 , increasing the magnitude of the form factor .    </S>",
    "<S> \\4 . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results are consistent with the available data on @xmath5 from mit - bates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> forthcoming data from jefferson lab e94 - 018 @xcite are extremely important to test the proposed relativistic approach in the region of higher transferred momenta , where relativistic corrections appear to be significant .    </S>",
    "<S> = n y    we would like to make the following comments to the obtained results . </S>",
    "<S> first , the dependence of @xmath48 structure on the choice of different sets of experimental @xmath12 phase shifts available from the literature is strong enough . </S>",
    "<S> possible variation of @xmath54 may shift the position of zero in @xmath48 from the indicated point @xmath55 to the point @xmath56 or to the point @xmath57 . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> the secondary maximum is located in the interval @xmath58 , and its height may change by a factor of seven . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that for improving our understanding of @xmath48 it would be desirable to obtain a more definite phase shifts analysis of @xmath12 scattering in triplet channel in intermediate energy region @xmath59 gev . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , let us indicate the dependence of @xmath48 on the possible choice of nucleon em form factors . </S>",
    "<S> since the uncertainties of @xmath60 in the considered range of @xmath6 are very small , the main effect in @xmath48 may be caused only by variation of @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> it seems to be generally accepted that the maximal deviation of @xmath61 from the zero - value approximation @xmath62 is given by known formula @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the neutron anomalous magnetic moment and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the calculations of @xmath48 with this nonzero values of @xmath61 are shown in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the effect is sizable and the contributions of relativistic effects and nonzero @xmath66 have a similar behaviour .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show for comparison in fig.2 the results of calculation of @xmath5 in a relativistic approach , developed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it may be seen that zero of @xmath48 predicted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is shifted to the lower values of @xmath6 and the height of the secondary maximum is approximately the same as in our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> note that in more recent calculations in the similar approach @xcite the predicted position of zero in @xmath48 remains almost unchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> here we restricted ourselves only to the discussion of the deuteron charge form factor @xmath5 . even in this case </S>",
    "<S> we omitted such interesting questions as an analytical representation of relativistic corrections in different orders in @xmath67 , the new representation for realistic deuteron wave functions , the role of relativistic rotation of nucleon spins and orbital momentum @xmath14 in the deuteron , the problem of extraction , using the present approach , of @xmath61 for ultralow values of @xmath6 from experimental data on elastic ed  scattering , and contributions from meson  exchange currents . </S>",
    "<S> it would also be interesting to perform a detailed comparison of the present approach with other relativistic approaches to the description of deuteron structure .    </S>",
    "<S> all these questions , as well as the calculations of the deuteron magnetic and quadrupole form factors will be discussed in forthcoming publications .    </S>",
