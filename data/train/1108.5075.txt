    "macroscopic superpositions are at the heart of quantum information devices as they realize quantum two - level systems ( qubits ) .",
    "qubits can either be of single particle nature ( single atom , single spin ) , or realized using collective degrees of freedom whose low - energy spectrum reduces to two discrete states ( eg collective internal state transitions for rydberg atoms @xcite , and current states in superconducting squids @xcite ) .",
    "collective - mode superpositions are expected to be better protected against some forms of decoherence such as particle losses , since quantum correlations are spread over several single particle modes and the loss of one particle does not imply the destruction of the collective mode , hence allowing the superposition to survive .",
    "on the other hand , multimode superpositions imply the use of several different single particle states , and hence typically have a limited degree of entanglement .",
    "ultracold atomic gases are interesting candidates for the realization of macroscopic superpositions due to their high purity and tunability .",
    "most of the current proposals are based on two - mode bose - josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "experimental advances in the realization of ring traps @xcite make it realistic to consider other macroscopic superpositions , eg the ( collective - mode ) superposition of superflow states carrying different values of angular momentum @xcite , where the coupling between angular - momentum states is provided by a localized barrier which breaks translational invariance ; an artificial gauge field ( or rotation ) @xcite gives rise to tunability equivalent to magnetic flux in a squid . as a consequence of the ring periodicity , the energy levels of the many - particle system as a function of the flux @xmath0 associated with the artificial gauge field are periodic with period @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the atomic mass . in an adiabatic protocol , equally - weighted superposition states can be realized by tuning the flux near a half - integer value of the ratio @xmath3 , in correspondence to an avoided level - crossing  @xcite .    in the case of a quasi-1d",
    "tightly - confining ring trap the possibility of creating macroscopic superpositions has been considered in detail , both for lattice and continuum models @xcite .",
    "with respect to an ideal bose gas , weak repulsive interactions induce small energy - level splittings which are harmful to the superpositions .",
    "quite interestingly , in the strongly - interacting limit of impenetrable bosons ( or tonks - girardeau limit ) this drawback is overcome . due to its fermionized character @xcite , the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas displays the same energy splittings as for noninteracting bosons @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to its impenetrability , two- and three - body losses are suppressed in a tg gas @xcite , thus eliminating one of the main sources of decoherence in ultracold gases .",
    "the tg gas is therefore a very promising candidate for the realization of macroscopic superpositions of current states , as can be obtained , eg , by setting into motion a localized barrier potential . in the tg limit ,",
    "creation of stationary superposition states with velocity @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the ring circumference can be obtained by an adiabatic switching on of the barrier to a velocity @xmath7 corresponding to half a coriolis flux quantum @xcite .",
    "such superpositions have maximal useful correlations for interferometry @xcite , with applications to ultra - precise atomic gyroscopes .",
    "we focus in this work on a sudden switch on of the barrier motion to velocity @xmath8 multiple of @xmath7 .",
    "we find that it gives rise to rabi - like oscillations between states with velocity components @xmath4 and @xmath9 , similarly to what has been observed for a superlattice ring @xcite . at specific times",
    ", we find an equally - weighted macroscopic superposition of two multiparticle states with velocity components @xmath4 and @xmath9 . in view of the multimode aspects of the strongly correlated tg state , several questions are open regarding such a novel superposition , in particular on its nature and on its degree of entanglement .",
    "for example , similarly to a fermi gas , impenetrable bosons can not occupy the same single particle state , hence , different from ref.@xcite , the macroscopic superposition is not expected to be close to the usual `` noon '' state , @xmath10|vac\\rangle$ ] where all the @xmath11 atoms occupy the @xmath12 or the @xmath13 single particle level , @xmath14 being the creation operator of a boson with momentum @xmath15 .",
    "these questions can be addressed by our fully microscopic , analytical solution for the dynamical evolution by mapping onto a fermi gas @xcite .",
    "we obtain the exact expression for the wavefunction of the superposition state , which schematically reads @xmath16|vac\\rangle$ ] , where @xmath17 is the creation operator of a fermion with momentum @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the mapping function from fermions to bosons and @xmath20 is the fermi wavevector of the mapped fermi gas .",
    "such an entangled , correlated many - body superposition is only accessible through an out - of - equilibrium drive .",
    "furthermore , our microscopic approach allows to obtain the time of formation of the superposition , and to set constraints on the excitation process .",
    "finally , it allows to simulate the time - of - flight signal which is the standard probe used in experiments .",
    "we consider @xmath11 impenetrable bosons on a ring of circumference @xmath6 at zero temperature , subjected to the stirring delta - barrier potential @xmath21 .",

    "the barrier is then suddenly set into motion at time @xmath38 .",

    "the inset shows the short - time evolution ( time in units of @xmath55 ) of the integrated particle current ( in units of @xmath56).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "we first consider a velocity close to a special value @xmath57 with integer @xmath58 , which corresponds to half integer values of the coriolis flux ratio @xmath3 , with @xmath59 .",
    "we focus on the small barrier limit @xmath60 . as is seen in fig.[fig1 ]",
    ", this choice of @xmath8 corresponds to several avoided level crossings of single particle states . as a consequence of the sudden quench of the barrier velocity , we find that the tg gas , which initially occupies the zero - momentum fermi sphere of the mapped fermi system , oscillates between two @xmath11-particle fermi spheres , one centered at @xmath61 and the other at @xmath62 , realizing at half oscillation an equally weighted macroscopic superposition of the two fermi spheres .",
    "the derivation reads as follows .",
    "according to the expression for the overlaps @xmath63 , the states excited under the effect of the stirring drive are fixed by quasimomentum conservation @xmath64 for @xmath65 , or @xmath66 for @xmath67 . in detail , taking for simplicity @xmath68 which will turn out to be the most favourable situation , we find that to leading order in @xmath69 only four states @xmath70 are coupled to each single - particle level @xmath71 of the initial - state fermi sphere , with coefficients @xmath72 for @xmath73 $ ] and @xmath74}$ ] , int@xmath75 $ ] denoting the integer part ; with the exception of the lowest state @xmath76 , where @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "for each level @xmath49 we know its momentum ( hence angular momentum ) components from the analysis of the zero - barrier limit , where a true level crossing occurs of two states of well defined angular momentum .",
    "for example , for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the level @xmath76 is coupled by the stirring barrier to the states with @xmath82 and 5 which are both an equal - weight superposition of states with momentum @xmath61 and @xmath83 .",
    "similarly , the levels @xmath84 and 3 yield an equal - weight superposition of states with @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the lowest - energy doublet and of @xmath87 and @xmath88 for the highest - energy doublet . summing up all the contributions",
    ", we find that each momentum state has the same occupation , and the momentum occupation distribution is a superposition of the two fermi spheres @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "a similar reasoning holds for arbitrary barrier velocities and particle numbers ( chosen odd to ensure proper boundary conditions on the mapped bose gas ) , leading to the occupation of two fermi spheres centered at @xmath4 and @xmath91 . from eqs.([psi_manybody ] ) and ( [ eq : orbitals ] ) , the many - body wavefunction of the superposition is finally obtained by mapping onto a fermi gas where each atom occupies a different superposition of a few ( typically four , in the weak barrier limit ) single particle orbitals .",
    "the detailed dynamics of the system is also simply described , according to the values of the overlaps @xmath63 , in terms of the occupation of a few momentum states for each single - particle state @xmath71 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : orbitals ] ) , the time dependence eg of the particle current density @xmath92 is fixed by the time - evolution factors @xmath93 .",
    "the typical time scale is fixed by the energy level splitting associated to the highest two levels occupied through the stirring drive .",
    "the short - time behaviour of the integrated current @xmath94 is illustrated in the inset of fig.[fig1 ] ; the time evolution is not purely sinusoidal due to the multimode nature of the superposition .",
    "consider now the off - resonant case @xmath95 . in this case",
    "a weak barrier does not transfer angular momentum to the gas and the momentum occupation distribution is a single fermi sphere centered at @xmath61 .",
    "this is readily derived by inspecting the overlaps @xmath63 , yielding @xmath96 for @xmath78 , and @xmath77 for @xmath97 with @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "we note that the state of the system found under a sudden switching on of the barrier velocity is very different from the one obtained by an adiabatic turning on , where the lowest @xmath11 single particle energy levels are populated and the momentum occupation distribution is either a single fermi sphere centered at @xmath99 for even @xmath58 , or a superposition of two fermi spheres centered at @xmath100 and @xmath101 for odd @xmath58 .    as a partial summary",
