    "the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) models many phenomena observed in the recently created dilute gas bose - einstein condensates ( becs)@xcite . in this context it is also referred to as the gross - pitaevski equation@xcite .",
    "the nlse is ubiquitous .",
    "it describes wave propagation phenomena in many systems besides the bec , including optical pulses in fibers@xcite , helical excitations of a vortex line@xcite , bose - condensed photons@xcite , and magnetic films  @xcite .",
    "it is one of a few basic equations upon which the modern theory of integrable nonlinear systems has been founded @xcite .",
    "many applications of the nlse to becs have dealt with ground - state properties , but there is growing interest in the possibility of generating topological excitations of a condensate , which may well be described by excited - state solutions of the nlse . in this article",
    "we investigate such solutions , in the case of a one - dimensional nlse for repulsive nonlinearity , subject either to box or periodic boundary conditions on a finite interval .",
    "this corresponds to a bec with repulsive atomic pair interactions , which is the case that has received the most experimental interest ; a companion paper @xcite treats the case of attractive interactions .",
    "the stationary excited states that we study here are related to the well - known soliton solutions of the time - dependent nlse , and when perturbed give rise to soliton - type motions @xcite .",
    "recent experiments show that such motions can be induced in becs by optical engineering of the condensate phase@xcite .",
    "box and periodic boundary conditions are as ubiquitous as the nlse and give physical insight into the solutions to more complicated potentials  @xcite .",
    "they model the potentially quasi - one - dimensional regime of a number of present experiments : the atom waveguide  @xcite ; the prolate harmonic trap in which is formed a cigar - shaped bec  @xcite ; the newly - developed toroidal trap  @xcite ; and finally an oblate harmonic trap with a barrier formed in the middle either by a second spin state of the same atom  @xcite or by a laser  @xcite , in which is formed a pancake - shaped bec with the center removed .",
    "periodic boundary conditions provide a first model for toroidal geometries ; box boundary conditions are a good starting model for cigar - shaped geometries .",
    "the full spectrum of soliton solutions to the nlse on the infinite line was discovered by zakharov and shabat@xcite .",
    "these authors used the inverse scattering transform , a method to which a great deal of mathematical physics literature has been devoted@xcite . to solve the nlse under these new boundary conditions we have chosen instead to use straightforward , elementary methods , accessible to a broad spectrum of physicists and simpler than the inverse scattering transform .",
    "there have been many recent applications of zakharov and shabat s solutions to the bec@xcite .",
    "toroidal@xcite and cylindrical or box - shaped@xcite geometries have been considered .",
    "some authors have solved the parabolic potential numerically@xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge no one to - date has explored , analytically or otherwise , the full spectrum of bounded , _ stationary _ , multiple - soliton solutions to the nlse under periodic and box boundary conditions .",
    "the nonlinear schrdinger equation which describes the bec for @xmath0 is a three - dimensional mean field theory .",
    "we define the bec to be in the quasi - one - dimensional regime when its transverse dimensions are on the order of its healing length and its longitudinal dimension is much longer than its transverse ones . in this case",
    "the 1d limit of the 3d nlse is appropriate , rather than a true 1d mean field theory  @xcite , as would be the case for a transverse dimension on the order of the atomic interaction length .    the quasi-1d limit of the 3d nlse is implicitly used in many places in the literature , a recent example being liu _",
    "et al._@xcite discussions which take into account transverse excitations and various other geometries may be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "we present a brief derivation in which we require that the wavefunction be approximately separable and that its transverse parts be in the ground state . by requiring the transverse dimensions to be on the order of the healing length we ensure both separability of the wavefunction and transverse stability of the solutions , as we have numerically illustrated in other works  @xcite .",

    "@xmath3 is defined to be a three - dimensional rectangular box of length l and small transverse area @xmath10 . in the transverse directions",
    "the wavefunction is required to vanish on the surface of the container ; in the longitudinal direction we require either box or periodic boundary conditions .",
