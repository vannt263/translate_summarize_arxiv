    "let me begin my talk with the electroweak symmetry breaking and the mystery of something in the vacuum .",
    "we all know that the success of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is a success of gauge principle .",
    "we know that the transverse components of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are gauge fields of the electroweak ( ew ) gauge symmetry .",
    "since the gauge symmetry forbids explicit mass terms for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it must be broken by _ something condensed in the vacuum _ which carries ew charges : @xmath3 this `` something '' supplies three longitudinal modes of @xmath1 and @xmath2 : @xmath4 since left- and right - handed matter fermions carry different ew charges , explicit mass terms are also forbidden for matter fermions by the ew gauge symmetry .",
    "their masses have to be generated through their yukawa interactions with some weak - charged vacuum which compensates the ew - charge difference . in the sm",
    ", the same `` something '' mixes the left- and right - handed matter fermions , consequently generating masses and inducing flavor - mixings among generations . in order to form the yukawa interaction terms , we need a complex doublet scalar field .",
    "the sm identifies three real components of the doublet with the goldstone modes that supply the longitudinal modes of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we need one more to form a complex doublet , which is the physical higgs boson .",
    "this sm symmetry breaking sector is the simplest and the most economical , but there is no reason for it .",
    "the symmetry breaking sector ( hear after cooled the higgs sector ) might be more complex .",
    "we do nt know whether the `` something '' is elementary or composite .",
    "we know it s there in the vacuum with a vev of 246gev .",
    "but other than that we did nt know almost anything about the `` something '' until july 4th , 2012 .    since the july 4th",
    ", the world has changed !",
    "the discovery of the 125gev boson ( @xmath5 ) at the lhc could be called a quantum jump @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 decay means @xmath7 is a neutral boson having a spin not equal to 1 ( landau - yang theorem ) .",
    "we know that the 125gev boson decays to @xmath8 and @xmath9 , indicating the existence of @xmath10 couplings , where @xmath11 , gauge bosons .",
    "there is , however , no gauge coupling like @xmath10 .",
    "coupling and its relation to the mass term of @xmath12.,width=377 ]    there are only @xmath13 and @xmath14 , hence @xmath10 is most probably from @xmath13 with one @xmath7 replaced by its vacuum expectation value @xmath15 , namely @xmath16 .",
    "then there must be @xmath17 , a mass term for @xmath12 , meaning that @xmath7 is at least part of the origin of the masses of @xmath11 .",
    "this is a great step forward but we need to know whether @xmath18 saturates the sm vev of 245gev .",
    "the observation of the @xmath19 decay means that @xmath7 can be produced via @xmath20 .",
    "decay and @xmath21 process.,width=321 ]    by the same token , @xmath22 means that @xmath7 can be produced via the @xmath1-fusion process : @xmath23 .",
    "so we now know that the major higgs production processes in @xmath24 collisions are indeed available at the ilc , which can be regarded as a `` no lose theorem '' for the ilc .",
    "the @xmath25gev is the best place for the ilc , where variety of decay modes are accessible .",
    "we need to check this @xmath25gev boson in detail to see if it has indeed all the required properties of the `` something '' in the vacuum .    the properties to measure are the mass , width , @xmath26 , gauge quantum numbers , yukawa couplings to various matter fermions , and its coupling to itself .",
    "the key is to measure _ the mass - coupling relation_. if the 125gev boson is the one to give masses to all the sm particles , coupling should be proportional to mass as shown in fig.[fig : mass - coupling1 ] .",
    "any deviation from the straight line signals physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "the higgs is a window to bsm physics .",
    "our mission is the bottom - up model - independent reconstruction of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector through the coupling measurements .",
    "we need to determine the multiplet structure of the higgs sector by answering questions like : is there an additional singlet or doublet or triplet ? what about the underlying dynamics ?",
    "is it weakly interacting or strongly interacting ?",
    "in other words , is the higgs boson elementary or composite ? we should also try to investigate its possible relation to other questions of particle physics such as dark matter , electroweak baryogenesis , neutrino masses , and inflation .",
    "there are many possibilities to discuss and that s exactly why we are here in this meeting .",
    "the july 4th was the opening of a new era which will last probably twenty years or more , where a 500gev linear collider such as the ilc will and must play the central role .",
    "there are three very well know thresholds .",
    "the first threshold is at around @xmath27gev , where the @xmath28 process will fully open .",
    "we can use this process to measure the higgs mass , width , and @xmath26 . as we will see below ,",
    "this process allows us to measure the @xmath0 coupling in a completely model - independent manner through the recoil mass measurement .",
    "this is very important in extracting branching ratios for various decay modes such as @xmath29 , as well as invisible decays .",
    "the second threshold is at around @xmath30gev , which is the @xmath31 threshold . through the threshold scan ,",
    "we can make a theoretically very clean measurement of the top quark mass , which can be translated into @xmath32 to an accuracy of @xmath33mev .",
    "the precision top mass measurement is , together with the precision higgs mass measurement , very important from the view point of the stability of the electroweak vacuum @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31 threshold also provides an opportunity to indirectly access the top yukawa coupling through the higgs exchange diagram as well as various @xmath31 bound state effects through the measurements of the forward - backward asymmetry and the top momentum , not to mention various form factor measurements to investigate possible anomaly in top - quark related couplings @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that the @xmath34 collider option at this energy allows the double higgs production : @xmath35 , which can be used to study the higgs self - coupling @xcite .",
    "notice also that at @xmath30gev and above , @xmath36 process becomes sizable with which we can measure the @xmath37 coupling and accurately determine the total width , as we will see later .",
    "the third threshold is at around @xmath38gev , where the production cross section for @xmath39 process attains its maximum , which allows us to access the higgs self - coupling . at @xmath38gev , another important process , @xmath40 ,",
    "will also open though the product cross section is much smaller than its maximum that happens at around @xmath41gev .",
    "nevertheless , as we will see , qcd threshold correction enhances the cross section and allows us to measure the top yukawa coupling with a reasonable precision concurrently with the self - coupling .    by covering @xmath42 to @xmath43gev",
    ", we can hence complete the mass - coupling plot .",
    "this is why the first phase of the ilc project is designed to cover the energy up to @xmath38gev .",
    "let us now start with the first threshold at around @xmath27gev .",
    "perhaps the most important measurement at this energy is the recoil mass measurement for the process : @xmath28 followed by @xmath44 decay .",
    "since the initial state 4-momentum is precisely known , we can calculate the invariant mass of the system recoiling against the lepton pair from the @xmath2 decay by just measuring the momenta of the lepton pair : @xmath45 figure [ fig : mrec ] shows the recoil mass distribution for a @xmath46gev higgs boson , with 250fb@xmath47 at @xmath27gev .",
    "followed by @xmath48 decay for @xmath46gev with @xmath49fb@xmath47 at @xmath27gev @xcite.,width=340 ]    you can see a very clean higgs peak with small background . since we do nt need to look at the higgs decay at all , its invisible decay is also detectable .",
    "this way , we can determine the higgs mass to @xmath50mev and the production cross section to @xmath51% , and limit the invisible branching ratio to @xmath52 at the @xmath53 confidence level . this is the flagship measurement of the ilc at 250gev that allows a model - independent absolute measurement of the @xmath0 coupling@xcite .",
    "+ we can also use the @xmath28 process to measure various branching ratios for various higgs decay modes .",
    "this time we include @xmath54 and @xmath55 decays in our analysis to enhance the statistical precision .",
    "notice , however , that what we can actually measure is _ not _ branching ratio ( @xmath56 ) itself but the cross section times branching ratio ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "table [ tab : sigbr250 ] summarizes the expected precisions for the @xmath58 measurements @xcite    .expected relative errors for the @xmath58 measurements at @xmath27gev with @xmath49fb@xmath47 for @xmath46gev . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : gupta ]    these numbers can be understood from the following formulas for the different models in the decoupling limit @xcite : @xmath59 the different models predict different deviation patterns .",
    "the ilc together with the lhc will be able to fingerprint these models or set the lower limit on the energy scale for bsm physics .",
    "the primary goal for the next decades is to uncover the secret of the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this will open up a window to bsm and set the energy scale for the energy frontier machine that will follow the lhc and the ilc 500 .",
    "probably the lhc will hit systematic limits at @xmath60(5 - 10% ) for most of @xmath57 measurements , being insufficient to see the bsm effects if we are in the decoupling regime . to achieve the primary goal",
    "we hence need a 500gev linear collider for self - contained precision higgs studies to complete the mass - coupling plot , where we start from @xmath28 at @xmath27gev , then @xmath31 at around @xmath61gev , and then @xmath62 and @xmath63 at @xmath43gev .",
    "the ilc to cover up to @xmath38gev is an ideal machine to carry out this mission ( regardless of bsm scenarios ) and we can do this with staging starting from @xmath64gev .",
    "we may need more data at this energy depending on the size of the deviation , since the recoil mass measurement eventually limits the coupling precisions .",
    "luminosity upgrade possibility should be always kept in our scope .",
    "if we are lucky , some extra higgs boson or some other new particle might be within reach already at the ilc 500 .",
    "let s hope that the upgraded lhc will make another great discovery in the next run from 2015 . if not , we will most probably need the energy scale information from the precision higgs studies .",
    "guided by the energy scale information , we will go hunt direct bsm signals , if necessary , with a new machine .",
    "eventually we will need to measure @xmath65 scattering to decide if the higgs sector is strongly interacting or not .",
    "in this talk i have been focusing on the case where @xmath5 alone would be the probe for bsm physics , but there is a good chance for the higher energy run of the lhc to bring us more .",
    "it is also very important to stress that the ilc , too , is an energy frontier machine .",
    "it will access the energy region never explored with any lepton collider before .",
    "there can be a zoo of new uncolored particles or new phenomena that are difficult to find at the lhc but can be discovered and studied in detail at the ilc .",
    "for instance , natural susy where the @xmath66 parameter not far above @xmath33gev , we expect relatively light chargino and neutralinos which are higgsino - dominant and hence nearly mass - degenerate ( typically @xmath67 of a few gev or less ) , a very difficult case for the lhc . at the ilc @xmath67 as small as @xmath68mev",
    "can be handled with the isr tagging .",
    "if @xmath69mev or so , we can determine the masses to @xmath70gev and @xmath67 to @xmath71mev .",
    "if this is the case , the ilc will be not only the higgs factory but also a higgsino factory @xcite .",
    "another example is search for possible anomalies in precision studies of properties of @xmath72 and top , or two - fermion processes @xcite .",
    "whatever new physics awaits us , clean environment , polarized beams , and excellent jet energy resolution to reconstruct @xmath73 and @xmath74 in their hadronic decays will enable us to uncover the nature of the new physics through model - independent precision measurements .",
    "the materials presented in this talk were prepared for the ilc tdr physics chapter in collaboration with the members of the ilc physics working group @xcite and the members of the ilc physics panel .",
