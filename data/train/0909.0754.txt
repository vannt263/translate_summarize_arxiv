    "therefore , to a first approximation the initial stress tensor will be locally azimuthally symmetric .",
    "subsequently , if there are no reinteractions the produced matter will free stream to the detector ; the initial geometry will have no influence on the evolution , and the angular distribution of the final observed hadrons will also be azimuthally symmetric . on the other hand , if there are strong interactions which maintain local thermal equilibrium , the pressure gradients in the @xmath4 direction will be larger than in the @xmath5 direction , an anisotropy in the collective flow will develop , and ultimately an anisotropy in the momentum spectrum of the final hadrons will be observed .",
    "the final momentum anisotropy is characterized experimentally by @xmath6 , the second harmonic of the azimuthal distribution of the produced particles with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "experimentalists have measured @xmath6 as a function of transverse momentum @xmath3 , particle type , and impact parameter @xcite .",

    "this being the case , it is imperative to perform a systematic study on the form of the viscous correction as well as its effect on elliptic flow . most of this paper will discuss the form of the viscous correction appearing in weakly - coupled qcd .",
    "although this is not a theory of hadronizing qcd , it is one theory where quantitative first - principle calculations can be performed .",

    "the typical scattering is nearly randomizing , but high energy particles undergo fewer scatterings than low - energy ones .",
    "therefore we find the same functional form as for momentum diffusion but for very different reasons .",
    "this example from scalar field theory , together with the example of momentum diffusion ( see below ) , are the reason that most people assume the quadratic ansatz , @xmath43 should hold .      in this section we will use the boltzmann equation for pure - glue qcd in three approximation schemes to calculate the first viscous correction . first we will consider a leading @xmath76 approximation where the dynamics can be summarized by a fokker - planck equation which describes the momentum diffusion of quasi - particles . in this limit we will find that the viscous correction is quadratic at large momentum , @xmath43 . next we will consider the qcd boltzmann equation but consider only @xmath77 collisions and neglect collinear radiation . in this limit , we will find that the viscous correction at large momentum behaves as @xmath78 .",

    "we will find that collinear radiation controls the relaxation of the high momentum modes and asymptotically we have @xmath79 , where the coefficient of proportionality is set by the rate of transverse momentum broadening , @xmath80 .",

    "each soft collision involves a small momentum transfer of order @xmath82 , but these collisions happen relatively frequently at a rate of @xmath83 ( neglecting logarithms ) .",
    "thus a typical particle with momentum @xmath84 will diffuse in momentum space and equilibrate on a time scale of @xmath85 .",
    "the resulting boltzmann equation linearized around equilibrium can be written as a fokker - planck equation @xcite [ leading_log ] _ t f + v__x f = t ( n_p(1 + n_p ) ) + , where @xmath86 is the drag coefficient of a high momentum gluon in this approximation scheme@xcite [ bthoma_soft ] = - , = t^2 ( ) . the precise form of the gain terms has been given in @xcite , but only involves the @xmath87 spherical harmonic components of @xmath88 , @xmath49 @xmath89 and @xmath90 . in the hydrodynamic limit considered here",

    "these matrix elements must be dynamically screened using hard thermal loops .",
    "a procedure which is consistent at leading order ( where the debye mass is small ) but which makes a reasonable estimate when the debye mass is not small has also been described in @xcite , and we can follow exactly the numerical procedure of that reference to find @xmath95 .",

    "@xmath96 may be considered large , shows that ( p ) .",
    "the constant in front of the log is related to @xmath97 , the rate of collisional energy loss of a gluon with momentum @xmath37 , [ chi_coll ] ( p ) = . in a leading @xmath98 approximation",
    "the loss rate is @xcite [ bthoma ] _",
    "p = t^2 ( ) , as is rederived in .",

    "early calculations of the shear viscosity in pure - glue qcd found @xmath71 , that is , @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "however this is because they were leading - log treatments , which reduced to momentum diffusion discussed above .",

    "this should not be a surprise .",
    "after all , if we think about `` equilibration '' ( energy loss ) in qed , we find that although the leading order mechanism for the energy loss of a high energy electron is ionization ( elastic scattering ) , bremsstrahlung actually dominates the loss rate .",
    "this is the case because in bremsstrahlung the energy lost per scattering can scale with the incident energy , rather than being incident energy independent as is the case with ionization . as a result ,",
    "the penetration depth of an electromagnetic shower scales only logarithmically with the incident energy , _",
    "i.e. _ the relaxation time is constant up to logs , @xmath102 .",
    "if the same behavior occurred in qcd we would expect the linear to hold , @xmath58 .",
    "the current understanding of energy loss in perturbative qcd is that the high energy behavior lies between these extremes .",
    "high - energy particles in a qcd plasma lose energy predominantly by inelastic gluon radiation and the time scale for energy loss is short compared to the time scale for momentum diffusion ( `` jet broadening '' ) . in particular it was shown by baier _",
