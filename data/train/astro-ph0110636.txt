    "our knowledge of the cosmological parameters has increased dramatically with the release of recent cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations ( netterfield et al . 2001 ; lee et al .",
    "2001 ; halverson et al .",
    "recent analyses of these datasets ( de bernardis et al .",
    "2001 ; pryke et al .",
    "2001 ; wang , tegmark & zaldarriaga 2001 ) have reported strong new constraints on various parameters including the curvature of the universe and the amount of baryonic and dark matter .",
    "the precise determination from the cmb of other parameters such as the cosmological constant or the spectral index of primordial fluctuations can be limited by various degeneracies , and such degeneracies are best lifted by combining cmb data with either supernova ( sn ) data ( garnavich et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1997 ) or large scale structure ( lss ) surveys , such as pscz ( saunders et al . 2000 ) , 2df ( percival et al . 2001 ) or lyman-@xmath3 ( croft et al . 2001 ) data . at present , the values obtained from cmb measurements under the assumption of purely adiabatic fluctuations are consistent with the generic predictions of the inflationary scenario , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( linde 1990 ) , and with the standard big - bang nucleosynthesis bound , @xmath6 ( burles et al . 2001 ; esposito et al .",
    "all of these observations converge towards a consistent picture of our universe , providing strong support for the inflationary scenario as the mechanism which generated the initial conditions for structure formation .",
    "the derivation of the cosmological parameters from cmb is , however , an _ indirect _ measurement , relying on the assumptions of a theoretical scenario .",
    "for this reason , recent efforts have been made to study the effects of the removal of some of these assumptions .",
    "for example , a scale - invariant background of gravity waves , generally expected to be small , has been included in the analysis of kinney , melchiorri & riotto ( 2000 ) , wang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and efstathiou et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , with important consequences for parameter estimation .",
    "a scale - dependence of the spectral index has been included in the analysis of griffiths , silk & zaroubi ( 2001 ) , santos et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and hannestad et al .",
    "furthermore , in bucher , moodley & turok ( 2000 ) , trotta , riazuelo & durrer ( 2001 ) and amendola et al . ( 2001 ) , the effects of including isocurvature modes , which naturally arise in the most general inflationary scenarios , have been studied , with the finding that the inclusion of these modes can significantly alter the cmb result .",
    "even more drastic alterations have been proposed in bouchet et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and durrer , kunz & melchiorri ( 2001 ) .",
    "all the above modifications primarily affect the constraints on the curvature , on the physical baryon density parameter , @xmath7 , and the scalar spectral index @xmath8 .",
    "in this paper we study another possible modification to the standard scenario , namely variations in the parameter @xmath0 which describes the energy density of relativistic particles at times near decoupling , @xmath9 .",
    "cmb data analysis with variations in this parameter has been recently undertaken by many authors ( hannestad 2000 ; esposito et al .",
    "2001 ; orito et al . 2001 ; hansen et al . 2001 ; kneller et al . 2001",
    "; hannestad 2001 ; zentner & walker 2001 ) , giving rather crude upper bounds , significantly improved only by including priors on the age of the universe or by including supernovae ( sn ) or large scale structure ( lss ) data .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that there is little difference in the bounds obtained on @xmath10 , the effective number of relativistic species , between old and recent cmb data because of the degeneracy which we will describe in detail below .",
    "we focus here on the effects that the inclusion of this parameter , @xmath0 , has on the constraints of the remaining parameters in the context of purely adiabatic models .",
    "as we will show below ( and as observed previously , see e.g. hu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ) there is a strong degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "this is important , because an accurate determination of @xmath2 from cmb observations ( and of @xmath11 by including the hubble space telescope result @xmath12 ) can be useful for a large number of reasons .",
    "first of all , determining @xmath13 can shed new light on the nature of dark matter .",
    "the thermally averaged product of cross - section and thermal velocity of the dark matter candidate is related to @xmath2 , and this relation can be used to analyze the implications for the mass spectra in versions of the supersymmetric standard model ( see e.g. barger & kao 2001 , djouadi , drees & kneur 2001 , ellis , nanopoulos & olive 2001 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath11 can be determined in an independent way from the mass - to - light ratios of clusters ( turner 2001 ) , and the present value is @xmath14 ( carlberg et al . 1997 ; bahcall et al .",
    "furthermore , a precise measurement of @xmath11 will be a key input for determining the redshift evolution of the equation of state parameter @xmath15 and thus discriminating between different quintessential scenarios ( see e.g. weller and albrecht 2001 ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review various physical mechanisms that can lead to a change in @xmath0 with respect to the standard value . in section 3",
    ", we illustrate how the cmb angular power spectrum depends on this parameter and identify possible degeneracies with other parameters . in section 4",
    ", we present a likelihood analysis from the most recent cmb data and show which of the present constraints on the various parameters are affected by variations in @xmath0 .",
    "section 5 forecasts the precision in the estimation of cosmological parameters for the future space missions map and planck . finally ,",
    "in section 6 , we discuss our results and present our conclusions .",
    "in the standard model @xmath0 includes photons and neutrinos , and it can be expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the energy density in photons and @xmath18 is the energy density in one active neutrino .",
    "measuring @xmath0 thus gives a direct observation on the effective number of neutrinos , @xmath10 .",
    "naturally there are only 3 active neutrinos , and @xmath10 is simply a convenient parametrization for the extra possible relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath19 thus @xmath0 includes energy density from all the relativistic particles : photons , neutrinos , and additional hypothetical relativistic particles such as a light majoron or a sterile neutrino .",
    "such hypothetical particles are strongly constrained from standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , where the allowed extra relativistic degrees of freedom typically are expressed through the effective number of neutrinos , @xmath20 .",
    "bbn bounds are typically about @xmath21 ( burles et al .",
    "1999 ; lisi , sarkar & villante 1999 )",
    ".    one should , however , be careful when comparing the effective number of neutrino degrees of freedom at the times of bbn and cmbr , since they may be related by different physics ( hansen et al .",
    "this is because the energy density in relativistic species may change from the time of bbn ( @xmath22 mev ) to the time of last rescattering ( @xmath22 ev ) .",
    "for instance , if one of the active neutrinos has a mass in the range ev @xmath23 mev and decays into sterile particles such as other neutrinos , majorons etc . with lifetime @xmath24",
    ", then the effective number of neutrinos at cmbr would be substantially different from the number at bbn ( white , gelmini & silk 1995 ) .",
    "such massive active neutrinos , however , do not look too natural any longer in view of the recent experimental results on neutrino oscillations ( fogli et al .",
    "2001 ; gonzalez - garcia et al . 2001 ) , showing that all active neutrinos are likely to have masses smaller than an ev .",
    "one could instead consider sterile neutrinos mixed with active ones which could be produced in the early universe by scattering , and subsequently decay .",
    "the mixing angle must then be large enough to thermalize the sterile neutrinos ( langacker 1989 ) , and this can be expressed through the sterile to active neutrino number density ratio @xmath25 ( dolgov & hansen 2001 ) , where @xmath26 is the mixing angle , and @xmath27 counts the relativistic degrees of freedom . with @xmath28 of order unity we use the decay time , @xmath29 sec , and one finds , @xmath30 , which is much longer than the age of the universe for @xmath31 , so they would certainly not have decayed at @xmath32 .",
    "a sterile neutrino with mass of a few mev would seem to have the right decay time , @xmath33  yr , but this is excluded by standard bbn considerations ( kolb et al .",
    "1991 ; dolgov , hansen & semikoz 1998 ) .",
    "even though the simplest models predict that the relativistic degrees of freedom are the same at bbn and cmb times , one could imagine more inventive models such as quintessence ( albrect & skordis 2000 ; skordis & albrect 2001 ) which effectively could change @xmath34 between bbn and cmb ( bean , hansen & melchiorri 2001 ) .",
    "naturally @xmath34 can be both positive and negative . for bbn",
    ", @xmath34 can be negative if the electron neutrinos have a non - zero chemical potential ( kang & steigman 1992 ; kneller et al .",
    "2001 ) , or more generally with a non - equilibrium electron neutrino distribution function ( see e.g. hansen & villante 2000 ) . to give an explicit ( but highly exotic ) example of a different number of relativistic degrees of freedom between bbn and cmb",
    ", one could consider the following scenario .",
    "imagine another 2 sterile neutrinos , one of which is essentially massless and has a mixing angle with any of the active neutrinos just big enough to bring it into equilibrium in the early universe , and one with a mass of @xmath35 mev and decay time @xmath36 sec , in the decay channel @xmath37 , with @xmath38 a light scalar .",
    "the resulting non - equilibrium electron neutrinos happen to exactly cancel the effect of the massless sterile state , and hence we have @xmath39 .",
    "however , for cmb the picture is much simpler , and we have just the stable sterile state and the majoron , hence @xmath40 . for cmb",
    ", one can imagine a negative @xmath34 from decaying particles , where the decay products are photons or electron / positrons which essentially increases the photon temperature relative to the neutrino temperature ( kaplinghat & turner 2001 ) .",
    "such a scenario naturally also dilutes the baryon density , and the agreement on @xmath41 from bbn and cmb gives a bound on how negative @xmath42 can be .",
    "considering all these possibilities , we will therefore not make the usual assumption , @xmath43 , but instead consider @xmath42 as a completely free parameter in the following analysis .",
    "the standard model value for @xmath10 with 3 active neutrinos is @xmath44 .",
    "this small correction arises from the combination of two effects arising around the temperature @xmath45 .",
    "these effects are the finite temperature qed correction to the energy density of the electromagnetic plasma ( heckler 1994 ) , which gives @xmath46 ( lopez & turner 1999 ; lopez et al .",
    "if there are more relativistic species than active neutrinos , then this effect will be correspondingly higher ( steigman 2001 ) .",
    "the other effect comes from neutrinos sharing in the energy density of the annihilating electrons ( dicus et al . 1982 ) , which gives @xmath47 ( dolgov , hansen & semikoz 1997 , 1999 ; esposito et al .",
    "thus one finds @xmath48 .",
    "it still remains to accurately calculate these two effects simultaneously .",
    "the structure of the @xmath49 spectrum depends essentially on 4 cosmological parameters @xmath50 the physical baryonic density @xmath51 , the energy density in matter @xmath52 , the energy density in radiation @xmath0 and the ` shift ' parameter @xmath53 , which gives the position of the acoustic peaks with respect to a flat , @xmath54 reference model . here",

    "the degeneracy in the acoustic peaks region is now slightly spoiled by the variation of the ratio @xmath85 : the different radiation content at decoupling induces a larger ( for @xmath86 ) early isw effect , which boosts the height of the first peak with respect to the other acoustic peaks .",
    "nevertheless , it is still impossible to distinguish between the different models with present cmb measurements and without external priors .",

    "radiation degeneracy in the cmb data is present only up to the third peak and future space missions like planck will be able to determine separately the amount of matter and radiation in the universe .",
