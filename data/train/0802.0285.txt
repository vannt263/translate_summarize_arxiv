    "nonlinear wave propagation in periodic media is an important phenomena , and it arises in a wide array of physical settings such as photonic - crystal fibers @xcite , photorefractive crystals imprinted with a photonic lattice @xcite , and bose - einstein condensates loaded in an optical lattice @xcite . the interplay between nonlinearity and periodicity results in a lot of new physical effects of the wave propagation .",
    "for instance , in a periodic media , solitons can exist not only under focusing nonlinearity , but also under defocusing nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "a distinctive feature of the periodic media is that it can support a wide variety of solitons residing in different band gaps .",
    "examples include fundamental solitons @xcite , dipole solitons @xcite , vortex solitons @xcite , reduced - symmetry solitons @xcite , higher - band vortex solitons @xcite , embedded - soliton trains @xcite , and so on  many of which have been experimentally observed .",
    "solitons in bessel - ring lattices have been reported too @xcite . in an effort to classify solitons in two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodic media , shi and",
    "yang @xcite studied low - amplitude solitons near bloch - band edges .",
    "these solitons are bloch waves modulated by slowly - varying envelope functions . using asymptotic techniques , they derived envelope equations , based on which they successfully classified all soliton families bifurcating from bloch - band edges .",
    "examples include fundamental solitons , reduced - symmetry solitons , dipole - array solitons , and many others .",
    "however , a peculiar question arose on vortex solitons . according to the envelope equations",
    ", those vortex solitons should also bifurcate from bloch - band edges",
    ". however , numerical results suggest that they disappear before reaching band edges @xcite .",
    "this paradox has not been resolved yet , and it clouds over the vortex - soliton research in periodic media .    in this paper , we comprehensively investigate charge - one vortex solitons residing in various band gaps of a 2d periodic media , and resolve the above paradox on this subject .",
    "for both the kerr ( cubic ) and saturable nonlinearities , we find that there exist infinite families of on - site and off - site vortex solitons in the semi - infinite gap ( for focusing nonlinearity ) and in the first gap ( for defocusing nonlinearity ) .",
    "we further show that all these vortex families do not bifurcate from edges of bloch bands .",
    "rather , before reaching band edges , they turn back and move into band gaps again . within each vortex family , shapes of vortex solitons undergo drastic changes as the propagation constant varies . as a result , vortices with very different topological structures",
    "can actually belong to the same family  a phenomenon which has never been reported before .",
    "these findings significantly deepen our understanding on vortex solitons in general periodic media .",
    "we first consider vortex solitons in 2d periodic media under kerr nonlinearity . the mathematical model for this situation is @xmath0",
    "where @xmath1 is a complex function , @xmath2 takes the value of 1 for focusing nonlinearity and @xmath3 for defocusing nonlinearity , and @xmath4 is a 2d periodic potential .",
    "this equation arises naturally in bose - einstein condensates loaded in an optical lattice @xcite as well as nonlinear light propagation in laser - written waveguides @xcite and photonic crystal fibers with weak transverse index variation . without loss of generality ,",
    "we take the periodic potential @xmath4 as @xmath5 and take @xmath6 in all our calculatioins .",
    "vortex solitons in eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) are sought in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the propagation constant , and @xmath9 is a complex - valued localized function which satisfies the equation @xmath10u+\\sigma|u|^2u=0 .",
    "\\label{eq : three}\\ ] ] we will determine these solutions numerically using the modified squared - operator iteration method and the power - conserving squared - operator method developed in @xcite .",
    "first , we study vortex solitons supported by the focusing kerr nonlinearity , i.e. @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : three ] ) . two types of vortex solitons  on - site and off - site ones , will be sought .",
    "on - site vortices are centered on a lattice site ( lattice peak ) , while off - site vortices are centered between lattice sites ( lattice minimum ) @xcite . for each type of vortices",
    ", various families are found in the semi - infinite gap .",
    "the power diagrams of the first two families of on - site and off - site vortex solitons are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( a , b ) respectively . here",
    "the power is defined by @xmath12 . a distinctive feature about these power curves",
    "is that each curve has a slanted u - shape . at each propagation",
    "constant @xmath8 away from the band edge , one can find two vortex solitons with different powers within each family .",
    "another feature about these curves is that none of them reaches the edge of the ( first ) bloch band .",
    "this means that none of these vortex families bifurcates from bloch bands .",
    "these features are in stark contrast with those for soliton families reported in @xcite , which do bifurcate from bloch bands ( in the low - amplitude limit ) , and each propagation constant only corresponds to a single soliton solution within each family . to find out what types of vortex solitons are contained in each family , we display them at four representative locations of each power curve in fig . 2 ( on - site ) and fig .",
    "3 ( off - site ) .",
    "first we examine the first on - site vortex family whose power curve is the solid ( blue ) one in fig .",
    "at four marked positions ` a - d ' on this curve , the corresponding vortex profiles are displayed in fig .",
    "2(a - d ) respectively .",
    "the phase structures of all these vortices are similar to that of the ring vortex soliton in bulk media and shown in the inset of fig .",
    "winding around the center of the vortex , the phase increases by @xmath13 , thus these vortices have charge one .",
    "the intensity distributions of these vortices , on the other hand , differ significantly at various locations of the power curve . on the lower branch of the power curve , when @xmath8 is far away from the bloch band , the vortex soliton consists of four main humps residing in the four lattice sites closest to the center site and forming a diamond configuration [ see fig . [ figure2 ] ( a ) ] .",
    "hence this is the familiar on - site vortex soliton which has been reported before @xcite .",
    "when @xmath8 increases toward the band edge along the lower branch , the vortex s power as well as its peak intensity decreases , and the vortex starts to develop tails on the outside of its four main humps [ see fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( b ) ] . as @xmath8 further increases beyond a cut - off value @xmath14=4.107 , which is close to but below the band edge @xmath15=4.126 , vortices in this family can not be found anymore .",
    "this phenomenon was first reported by one of the authors in @xcite , and it was puzzling at the time since we did not expect a solution branch terminating abruptly away from edges of bloch bands .",
    "this puzzle is now resolved by fig .",
    "what happens is that when @xmath8 reaches the cut - off value @xmath14 , the power curve turns around and enters the upper branch of the same family [ see fig .",
    "when passing through the turn - around , the vortex undergoes rapid shape changes and evolves into eight main humps in a square configuration surrounding the central lattice site .",
    "tails at the outside of this square are significant too . as @xmath8 moves away from the bloch band along the upper branch , the tails gradually fade away , and the eight main humps intensity totally dominate the vortex",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( d ) ] .",
    "thus , in this first family of on - site vortex solitons , the vortex undergoes dramatic shape changes from a four - humped diamond - like structure into an eight - humped square structure .",
    "this is quite unexpected and was not known before .",
    "+                  +            regarding the second on - site family , vortex solitons at four representative positions ` e - h ' of the power curve are displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( e - h ) .",
    "the phase structures of these vortices are similar to those in the first family [ see inset of fig .",
    "2(e ) ] , i.e. these vortices also have charge one .",
    "but the intensity patterns in this second family are quite different from those in the first family .",
    "specifically , in the lower branch of the second family , away from the bloch band , the vortex contains eight main humps in a larger - diamond configuration [ see fig .",
    "2(e ) ] . as @xmath8 moves continuously from the lower branch to the upper one",
    ", the vortex continuously evolves from this eight - humped diamond configuration to a sixteen - humped configuration resembling the surrounded wall of a castle [ see fig .",
    "2(e - h ) ] .",
    "this dramatic shape change within the same solution family occurs for all vortex families , and it is one of the main findings of this article .    for off - site vortex solitons in the semi - infinite gap ,",
    "various solution families are found as well . in the first off - site family",
    ", representative solution profiles are displayed in fig .",
    "3 ( a - d ) .",
    "these vortices also have a simple @xmath13 phase winding structure around the vortex center , thus having charge one [ see inset in fig .",
    "3(a ) ] . regarding their intensity patterns , when @xmath8 is far away from the bloch band on the lower branch",
    ", the vortex has four main humps occupying four adjacent lattice sites in a compact square configuration .",
    "this is the familiar off - site vortex soliton reported in @xcite .",
    "as @xmath8 moves from the lower branch to the upper one , the vortex changes from the four - humped square configuration to a twelve - humped compact cross configuration [ see fig .",
    "3(a - d ) ] . in the second off - site family ,",
    "lower - branch vortex solitons away from the bloch band have eight main humps arranged in an octagon configuration [ see fig .",
    "as @xmath8 moves to the upper branch , however , the vortex becomes a square with twelve main humps on its perimeter [ see fig .",
    "notice from fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( b ) that the upper branches of these two off - site families have almost the same power for the same propagation constant .",
    "this is because on these two upper branches , vortices of both families have the same number of main humps , and nearby humps are all aligned along the lattice direction and separated by one lattice spacing [ see fig .",
    "3(d , h ) ] .",
    "one may recall that for on - site vortices , the upper branch of the first family and the lower branch of the second family also have the same number of humps [ see fig .",
    "2(d , e ) ] . but",
    "adjacent humps in the latter case are aligned along diagonal directions of the lattice and have larger spatial separations than in the former case .",
    "this caused noticeable power differences between these two branches as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( a ) .    from fig . 1",
    ", we see that both on - site and off - site vortices can exist close to the bloch band [ see points ` c , g ' in fig .",
    "1(a ) for example ] .",
    "we find that such vortices near the bloch band have lower amplitudes .",
    "for instance , the vortex at point ` c ' in fig .",
    "1(a ) has amplitude 0.55 , and the one at point ` g ' has amplitude 0.48 .",
    "comparatively , vortex amplitudes far away from the bloch band are much higher .",
    "additionally , vortices close to the bloch band have long tails , and they resemble the bloch wave of the band edge modulated by a ring - vortex envelope [ see fig .",
    "2(c , g ) for instance ] .",
    "this seems to suggest that vortex solitons near bloch bands can be treated analytically by asymptotic methods .",
    "however , such asymptotic analysis encounters subtle problems for vortex solitons , as we will explain below .",
    "low - amplitude bloch - wave packets in eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "near the band edge @xmath15 in fig . 1 and under focusing nonlinearity , the leading - order asymptotic solution is @xmath16 , @xmath17 . here",
    ", @xmath18 is the bloch wave at the band edge @xmath15 ( with @xmath19-point symmetry ) , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and the envelope function @xmath22 satisfies the equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the second - order dispersion coefficient at the band edge , and @xmath25 is a constant .",
    "the envelope equation ( [ a ] ) admits a ring - vortex solution @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the polar coordinates of the @xmath28 plane . due to some additional constraints on the solution @xmath29 , this ring envelope",
    "can only be centered at certain locations at or between lattice sites @xcite .",
    "centering the ring - vortex envelope at a lattice site , the corresponding solution @xmath9 would then be a low - amplitude on - site vortex soliton which resembles the ones such as fig .",
    "2 ( c , g ) . centering the ring - vortex envelope between a lattice site",
    ", we would get a low - amplitude off - site vortex soliton which resembles the ones in fig .",
    "( c , f ) .",
    "however , a contradiction between this asymptotic analysis and numerical results is that , according to the asymptotic analysis , these vortices should exist continuously as @xmath8 approaches the band edge @xmath15 ( i.e. @xmath30 ) , but the numerical results in fig .",
    "1 indicate that true vortex solitons actually do not approach the band edge for each vortex family . apparently , the asymptotic analysis above is not entirely correct for vortex solitons , and it must be revised in order to explain the true vortex behaviors in figs . 1 - 3 .",
    "how this can be done is still unclear yet .",
    "note that these vortex behaviors are similar to multi - packet solitary waves in the fifth - order korteweg de vries equation @xcite , so the analytical treatment of @xcite might be useful for the present problem .",
    "this remains to be seen .",
    "[ figure1 ] just shows the first two families of on - site and off - site vortex solitons .",
    "we have also found other vortex families in eq .",
    "( [ eq : three ] ) whose power curves have similar slanted u - shapes and are higher than those in fig . [ figure1 ] .",
    "vortices in these higher families contain more intensity humps which are located further away from the center of the vortex , but their phase structures remain similar to those of the first two families ( i.e. they all have charge one ) .",
    "it can be inferred that infinite families of such vortex solitons exist in the semi - infinite gap , and all of them do not bifurcate from the edge of the first bloch band . within each higher family",
    ", vortex shapes also undergo drastic changes as @xmath8 moves from the lower branch to the upper one .",
    "the vortex solitons studied above are symmetric about the vortex center .",
    "asymmetric vortices also exist in a square lattice @xcite .",
    "we find that the power curves of asymmetric vortices also have slanted u - shapes as in fig . 1 , and they do not bifurcate from bloch bands either . we also find that asymmetric vortices reported in @xcite belong to the lower branches of these power curves . as @xmath8 moves to the upper branches , shapes of asymmetric vortices",
    "become very different and more complex .",

    "( [ eq : three ] ) .",
    "these vortices exist as infinite families in the first band gap .",
    "[ figure5 ] shows the power curves of the first on - site and off - site gap - vortex families .",
    "it is seen that these power curves also have a u - shape , but slanted in an opposite direction from the focusing case ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . spatial profiles and phase structures of these gap vortices at the marked points in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] are displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] ( on - site ) and fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] ( off - site ) .",
    "we see that the shapes of these first - family defocusing gap vortices ( @xmath32 ) resemble those of the first - family focusing vortices . specifically , for the first on - site defocusing family , as @xmath8 moves from the lower branch to the upper one , the shape of gap vortices changes from a four - humped diamond configuration to an eight - humped square configuration ( see fig .",

    "the most important difference between defocusing vortices and focusing vortices lies in their phase structures .",
    "the phase fields of focusing vortices have a simple @xmath13-winding structure like in ring vortices of bulk media [ see insets in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 3(a ) ] .",
    "however , phase structures of defocusing gap vortices are much more complex ( see figs .",
    "[ figure6 ] and [ figure7 ] ) . in the central region of gap vortices ,",
    "the phase field has a simple @xmath13-winding structure around the vortex center .",
    "but in the outer region , vortex phases at adjacent lattice sites sometimes have @xmath33 difference [ see figs .",
    "[ figure6](b , c ) and [ figure7](b , c ) ] , but some other times do not [ see figs . [ figure6](d ) and [ figure7](a ) ] .",
    "these complicated phase structures make the concept of topological charges ambiguous and not well defined for gap vortices .",
    "note that gap vortices reported earlier in @xcite correspond to the lower branches of our gap vortices in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] .    from fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , we see that gap vortices can exist quite close to the right edge of the first bloch band . at this band edge ,",
    "the second - order dispersion coefficient @xmath34 is negative . thus according to the envelope equation for this band edge , which is similar to eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) with only the sign of the @xmath35 term reversed , ring - vortex solutions @xmath26 exist under defocusing nonlinearity ( where @xmath36 ) .",
    "hence for @xmath8 close to this band edge , one may construct the analytical gap - vortex solution @xmath37 , where @xmath18 is the bloch wave at this right edge ( with @xmath38-point symmetry ) .",
    "this analytical gap - vortex solution qualitatively reproduces the intensity distribution , and more importantly , the intricate phase structure , of the true solution near the right edge of the first band [ see figs . [ figure6](b ) and [ figure7](b ) for instance ] .",
    "in particular , it explains the simple @xmath13 winding of the phase near the vortex center , and the @xmath33 phase difference between lattice sites in the far field ( due to the @xmath38-point symmetry of the bloch wave at this band edge ) . of course",
    ", this analytical gap - vortex solution can not explain why true gap vortices exist as infinite families , and each family does not continuously reach the band edge  the same difficulty we have seen with the focusing nonlinearity in the previous subsection .",
    "in photorefractive crystals where many lattice - soliton experiments were performed in recent years , the nonlinearity is saturable @xcite .",
    "even though wave phenomena under saturable and kerr nonlinearities have many features in common , significant differences exist as well . in this section ,",
    "we examine vortex solitons under saturable nonlinearity .",

    "all variables have been non - dimensionalized @xcite .",
    "when the soliton amplitude is low ( @xmath43 ) , the saturable nonlinearity becomes the same as the kerr nonlinearity .",
    "therefore , we can expect that near bloch bands , the vortex behavior under saturable nonlinearity should be similar to that under kerr nonlinearity .",

    "an infinite number of such vortex families exist in the semi - infinite gap , and one of them is reported below .",
    "the power curve of this family is displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] .",
    "we see that this curve is quite complicated .",
    "it has a number of turning points ( twists ) , and winds up and down in an unexpected way ( a somewhat similar power curve was reported for 1d lattice soltons under cubic - quintic nonlinearities in @xcite ) .",

    "[ figure9 ] .",
    "it is seen that far from the band edge ( point ` a ' in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] ) , the power is very high , and the vortex has a ring profile [ see fig . [ figure9](a ) ] .",
    "this ring profile can be easily understood since the vortex here has high intensities and dominates over the lattice , thus it effectively becomes a ring vortex in a lattice - free ( bulk ) media . as the power and intensity decrease ( when @xmath8 increases ) , the lattice effect starts to appear , and the vortex reshapes itself by distributing its main power to the lattice sites .",
    "this leads to a four - humped on - site vortex as seen in fig .",
