    "suppression of the inclusive pion spectra in central @xmath0 collisions at rhic relative to the peripheral ( or @xmath8 ) spectra can be understood in terms of non - abelian energy loss  @xcite in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in central nuclear collisions  @xcite .",
    "early phenix data on the nuclear modification factor , @xmath9 explored the transverse momentum range 2 gev / c @xmath10 10 gev / c , where the medium - induced non - abelian relative energy loss was found to be almost constant as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "a factor of @xmath12 suppression was measured  @xcite , and a fractional energy loss , @xmath13 , was extracted  @xcite .",
    "the most recent ( preliminary ) high-@xmath11 data on @xmath3  @xcite in central and mid - central @xmath1 and @xmath0 collisions cover the @xmath11 range up to @xmath14 gev / c , and show a slight increase with @xmath11 .",
    "such a decrease of the strength of the energy loss is expected at very high transverse momenta , even though the emc suppression is also present in this region@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the gyulassy - lvai - vitev ( glv )  @xcite energy loss at high transverse momenta in central @xmath15 collisions at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "we concentrate on the @xmath16 gev / c region , where pqcd results can be trusted . to check the scaling properties , we present @xmath17 as a function of both , @xmath11 and @xmath18 .",
    "we expect the nuclear modifications to scale with @xmath18 and to lose strength at high opacity and large transverse momenta .",
    "the slight increasing trend in the data on @xmath3 in ref  @xcite beyond @xmath19 gev / c both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions should be analyzed based on the high-@xmath11 behavior of nuclear shadowing and energy loss .",
    "the medium - induced non - abelian energy loss , which is expected to be the stronger of the two effects , is described by @xmath20 \\approx \\frac{c_r \\alpha_s}{n(e ) }   \\cdot \\frac{1}{a_{\\perp}}\\frac { { { \\textrm d}}n } { { { \\textrm d}}y } \\cdot \\langle l \\rangle   \\cdot \\log \\left [ \\frac{e}{\\langle \\mu \\rangle } \\right ] \\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where the meaning of the various symbols can be found in the glv reference@xcite .",
    "most important for the present study is the fact that the implied relative energy loss , @xmath21 , has a maximum at around @xmath22 gev / c ( which depends on the parameters weakly ) , and @xmath21 is almost constant in the @xmath23 gev / c @xmath24 gev / c energy region for opacity values @xmath25 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    at higher opacities",
    "the maximum is relatively stable at around @xmath26 gev , and it becomes more well - defined with increasing opacity .",
    "the effect of jet quenching thus becomes very strong around its maximum . at the same time , the energy loss is no longer a constant , but becomes an @xmath27-dependent quantity . due to the @xmath28 tail of the distribution",
    ", the energy loss of highly energetic jets is getting weaker , thus less suppression is expected at high @xmath11 values .",
    "theoretical expectation for @xmath29 give @xmath30 for the most central @xmath0 collisions at rhic@xcite , corresponding to @xmath31 , while @xmath32 is a rough estimate for lhc energies , making @xmath33 up to 12 relevant for calculations at lhc energies  @xcite .    to see the effect of the energy loss clearly , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] the generated nuclear modification with all initial and other final state nuclear effects switched off , using the above values .",
    "the left panel shows @xmath34 , while in the right panel we display @xmath35 .    with opacity @xmath36 , the nuclear modification is naturally @xmath37 .",
    "the strongest suppression is associated with the highest density of the medium , reflected here in @xmath38 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that , due to the different energy densities at rhic and lhc , a larger opacity value at lhc is expected to lead to a suppression similar to the one obtained at rhic with a smaller @xmath33 .",
    "comparing the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we conclude that @xmath18-scaling of @xmath39 from rhic ( dashed lines ) to lhc ( solid lines ) energies is more adequate than @xmath11 scaling .",
    "[ fig:3 ] includes the initial state nuclear effects , using hkn  @xcite shadowing in the pqcd improved parton model  @xcite .",
    "( the notation is similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . )",
    "it can be seen from the left panel that after a minimum , the data on @xmath39 increase toward high @xmath11 , due to the logarithmic tail of the energy loss . at @xmath2 gev / c",
    "the calculated nuclear modification factor exhibits a maximum and then decreases again , reaching the emc region .",
    "as seen on the right panel , the convolution with the shadowing function preserves the @xmath18 scaling of the nuclear modification  @xcite .",
    "based on the scaling , we attribute an approximate opacity parameter @xmath40 to central @xmath5 collisions at @xmath41 @xmath42tev lhc energy .",
    "note , however , that in minimum bias measurements an averaged opacity should be relevant , much smaller than the central maximum value .",
    "it should also be remembered that the suppression has an angular dependence , which needs to be tested by further geometrical studies of jets .",
    "we studied the non - abelian jet energy loss in the first - order glv framework . concentrating on the perturbative , high-@xmath11 region , we pointed out that the maximum of the energy loss becomes sharper , and that the phenomenon loses strength due to the logarithmic tail at high @xmath11 and opacities greater than @xmath43 . at larger opacities",
    "the standard picture of a constant relative energy loss needs to be modified .",
    "thus , energy - loss effects are more complicated than a simple shift of the high-@xmath11 spectra .",
    "this may explain why @xmath13 does not show perfect scaling for different system sizes or centralities  @xcite .",
    "we found that the energy loss scales with @xmath18 ( using appropriately different opacity values ) , and the introduction of initial - state nuclear effects preserves this scaling .",
    "based on fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we extract the opacity parameter @xmath44 for most central @xmath5 collisions at @xmath41 @xmath42tev lhc energy .",
    "the extracted @xmath33 values are high , but should only appear in the most dense region of the collision .",
    "the present description of the jet is incomplete , since the geometrical properties of the jet were not taken into account .",
    "a detailed analysis should investigate the angular size variation of the jet and the angular distribution of the energy loss inside the jet .",
