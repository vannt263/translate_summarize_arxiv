    "since almost a decade , observations from cosmic microwave background ( cmb hereafter ) satellite , balloon - borne and ground based experiments ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , galaxy redshift surveys @xcite and luminosity distance measurements , are fully confirming the theoretical predictions of the standard @xmath14cdm cosmological model .",
    "this not only permits to place stringent constraints on the parameters of the model but can be fruitfully used to constrain non standard physics at the fundamental level , such as classes of elementary particle models predicting a different radiation content in the universe .",
    "one of the major theoretical predictions of the standard scenario is the existence of a relativistic energy component ( see e.g. @xcite ) , beside cmb photons , with a current energy density given by :    @xmath15\\rho{_\\gamma } \\ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is the energy density of the cmb photons background at temperature @xmath17 and @xmath0 is in principle a free parameter , defined as the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom . assuming standard electroweak interactions , three active massless neutrinos and including the ( small ) effect of neutrino flavour oscillations the expected value is @xmath18 with a deviation from @xmath19 that takes into account effects from the non - instantaneous neutrino decoupling from the primordial photon - baryon plasma ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in recent years , thanks to the continuous experimental advancements , the value of @xmath0 has been increasingly constrained from cosmology ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , ruling out @xmath20 at high significance .",
    "however , especially after the new act @xcite and spt @xcite cmb results , the data seem to suggest values higher than the `` standard '' one , with @xmath21 ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) in tension with the expected standard value at about two standard deviations .",
    "the number of relativistic degrees of freedom obviously depends on the decoupling process of the neutrino background from the primordial plasma .",
    "however , a value of @xmath22 is difficult to explain in the three neutrino framework since non - standard neutrino decoupling is expected to maximally increase this value up to @xmath23 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a possible explanation could be the existence of a fourth ( or fifth ) sterile neutrino .",
    "the hypothesis of extra neutrino flavour is interesting since recent results from short - baseline neutrino oscillation data from lsnd @xcite and miniboone @xcite experiments are consistent with a possible fourth ( or fifth ) sterile neutrino specie ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , a larger value for @xmath24 could arise from a completely different physics , related to axions ( see e.g. @xcite ) , gravity waves ( @xcite ) , decaying particles ( see e.g. @xcite ) , extra dimensions @xcite and dark energy ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "any physical mechanism able to produce extra `` dark '' radiation produces the same effects on the background expansion of additional neutrinos , yielding a larger value for @xmath0 from observations .    since there is a large number of models that could enhance @xmath0 it is clearly important to investigate the possible ways to discriminate among them .",
    "if dark radiation is made of relativistic particles as sterile neutrinos it should behave as neutrinos also from the point of view of perturbation theory , i.e. if we consider the set of equations that describes perturbations in massless neutrino ( following the definition presented in @xcite ) :    @xmath25    it should have an effective sound speed @xmath3 and a viscosity speed @xmath4 such that @xmath26 .",
    "free streaming of relativistic neutrino will indeed produce anisotropies in the neutrino background yielding a value of @xmath27 while a smaller value would indicate possible non standard interactions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a value of @xmath4 different from zero , as expected in the standard scenario , has been detected in @xcite and confirmed in subsequent papers @xcite .",
    "more recently , the analysis of @xcite confirmed the presence of anisotropies from current cosmological data but also suggested the presence of a lower value for the effective sound speed with @xmath28 ruled out at more than two standard deviations .",
    "given the current situation and the experimental hints for @xmath29 is therefore timely to perform a new analysis for @xmath0 ( and the perturbation parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) with the most recent cosmological data .",
    "this is the kind of analysis we perform in this paper , organizing our work as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we describe the data and the data analysis method adopted .",
    "we present our results in the first two subsections of sec .",
    "iii , depending on two adopted different parametrizations for the dark radiation . moreover a model independent analysis is also discussed in the last subsection of sec .",
    "finally we conclude in sec . iv .",
    "we perform a cosmomc @xcite analysis combining the following cmb datasets : wmap7 @xcite , acbar @xcite , act @xcite , and spt @xcite , and we analyze datasets using out to @xmath30 .",
    "we also include information on dark matter clustering from the galaxy power spectrum extracted from the sdss - dr7 luminous red galaxy sample @xcite .",
    "finally , we impose a prior on the hubble parameter based on the last hubble space telescope observations @xcite .",
    "the analysis method we adopt is based on the publicly available monte carlo markov chain package ` cosmomc ` @xcite with a convergence diagnostic done through the gelman and rubin statistic .",
    "we sample the following six - dimensional standard set of cosmological parameters , adopting flat priors on them : the baryon and cold dark matter densities @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling @xmath33 , the optical depth to reionization @xmath34 , the scalar spectral index @xmath35 , and the overall normalization of the spectrum @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
    "we consider purely adiabatic initial conditions and we impose spatial flatness .",
    "we vary the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath0 , the effective sound speed @xmath7 , and the viscosity parameter @xmath8 . in some cases , we consider only variations in the _ extra _ dark radiation component @xmath38 , varying the perturbation parameters @xmath4 and @xmath3 only for this extra component and assuming @xmath26 for the standard @xmath10 neutrino component",
    ".    in our analysis we always fix the primordial helium abundance to the observed value @xmath39 .",
    "this procedure is different from the one adopted , for example , in @xcite , where the @xmath40 parameter is varied assuming big bang nucleosynthesis for each values of @xmath0 and @xmath31 in the chain . since the cosmological epoch and the energy scales probed by bbn are dramatically different from the ones probed by cmb and large scale structure we prefer to do not assume standard bbn in our analysis and to leave the primordial helium abundance as fixed to a value consistent with current observations",
    ".    we account for foregrounds contributions including three extra amplitudes : the sz amplitude @xmath41 , the amplitude of clustered point sources @xmath42 , and the amplitude of poisson distributed point sources @xmath43 .",
    "we marginalize the contribution from point sources only for the act and spt data , based on the templates provided by @xcite .",
    "we quote only one joint amplitude parameter for each component ( clustered and poisson distributed ) . instead",
    ", the sz amplitude is obtained fitting the wmap data with the wmap own template , while for spt and act it is calculated using the @xcite sz template at 148 ghz .",
    "again , this is different from the analysis performed in @xcite where no sz contribution was considered for the wmap data .",
    "as stated in the previous section , we perform two different analyses . in the first analysis we vary the amplitude of the whole relativistic contribution changing @xmath0 and the corresponding perturbation parameters @xmath8 and @xmath7 . in the second analysis",
    "we assume the existence of a standard neutrino background and vary only the extra component @xmath38 considering only in this extra component the variations in @xmath8 and @xmath7 .              in table [ standard ]",
    "we report the constraints on the cosmological parameters varying @xmath0 with and without variations in perturbation theory .",
    "we consider two cases : first we run our analysis fixing the perturbation parameters to the standard values , i.e. @xmath26 , then we let those parameters to vary freely .",
    ".mcmc estimation of the cosmological parameters assuming @xmath0 relativistic neutrinos .",
    "upper bounds at @xmath2 c.l . are reported for foregrounds parameters .",
    "we quote the one - dimensional marginalized @xmath44 and @xmath45 c.l . for the neutrino parameters . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     as we can see , when masses in the active neutrinos are considered , there is a slightly stronger evidence for the extra background with @xmath46 .",
    "this is can be explained by the degeneracy present between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , well known in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) and clearly shown in figure  [ sum - nus ] where we report the 2d marginalized contours in the plane @xmath49 .     at 68% and 95% c.l . .",
    "]       for @xmath0 .",
    "the dashed lines represent the @xmath50 and @xmath2 c.l . for a gaussian likelihood ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) respectively . ]",
    "recently , in @xcite , a model - independent analysis for the extra relativistic degrees of freedom in cosmological data has been performed claiming no statistically significant evidence for it .",
    "this simple analysis consists in extracting the maximum likelihood value @xmath53 as a function of @xmath0 over the parameter space sampled in the chains , with a bin width of @xmath54 and constructing a profile likelihood ratio by considering @xmath55 as a function of @xmath0 ; where @xmath56 is the maximum likelihood in the entire chains .",
    "here we perform a similar analysis , using however a smaller bin width of @xmath57 and considering the case where the whole number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath0 is varied while @xmath58 .",
    "the resulting likelihood ratio @xmath59 , plotted in figure [ maxlike ] , clearly indicates a preference for a dark radiation component finding that the best fit model has @xmath60 with a @xmath61 respect to the best fit model with @xmath18 .",
    "we should however point out that the ratio @xmath59 presented in figure [ maxlike ] is rather noisy .",
    "bayesian methods such as mcmc are indeed known to be inaccurate for this purpose ( see for example the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "other methods more appropriate for a frequentist analysis have been presented , for example , in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we performed a new search for dark radiation , parametrizing it with an effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown that the cosmological data we considered are clearly suggesting the presence for an extra dark radiation component with @xmath1 at @xmath2 c.l . .",
    "performing an analysis on its effective sound speed @xmath3 and viscosity @xmath4 parameters , we found @xmath5 and @xmath6 at @xmath2 c.l . ,",
    "consistent with the expectations of a relativistic free streaming component ( @xmath7=@xmath8=@xmath9 ) .",
    "assuming the presence of @xmath10 standard relativistic neutrinos we constrain the extra dark radiation component with @xmath11 and @xmath12 at @xmath2 c.l . while @xmath8 is practically unconstrained .",
    "assuming a mass in the @xmath10 neutrino component we obtain further indications for the dark radiation component with @xmath13 at @xmath2 c.l . .",
    "from these results we conclude that dark radiation currently represents one of the most relevant anomaly for the @xmath14-cdm scenario",
    ".    when comparison is possible , our results are in good agreement with the most recent analysis presented in @xcite that uses a different choice of datasets ( for example , we do nt consider matter fluctuations data from lyman-@xmath62 as in @xcite ) and an independent analysis method .",
    "dark radiation will be severely constrained in the very near future by the planck satellite data , where a precision on @xmath0 of about @xmath63 is expected ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) only from cmb data .",
    "we thank ryan keisler for providing us with the likelihood code for the spt data .",
    "we thank luca pagano for help . this work is supported by prin - inaf , `` astronomy probes fundamental physics '' .",
