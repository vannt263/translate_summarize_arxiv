    "determining the rotation of the milky way s disk is difficult , because our vantage point is corotating with the local stars .",
    "as first pointed out by @xcite and generalized by @xcite , the local rotational frequency and the local change in the circular velocity can be determined from the pattern of line - of - sight velocities and proper motions of nearby stars as a function of galactic longitude @xmath8 .",
    "expanding the milky way s in - plane velocity field to first order in heliocentric distance in an axisymmetric velocity field , the azimuthal shear and vorticity contribute @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and constant terms to the mean proper - motion and line - of - sight velocity , which can be distinguished from the @xmath11 and @xmath12 pattern due to the sun s peculiar motion with respect to nearby stars .",
    "going beyond the axisymmetric approximation , the radial shear and divergence contribute similar @xmath13 , @xmath10 , and constant terms .",
    "the four first - order terms ( azimuthal and radial shear , vorticity , and divergence ) are known as the oort constants .",
    "measurements of these constants provided the first strong evidence that the milky way is rotating differentially with a close - to - flat rotation curve @xcite .",
    "recently , the best measurements of the oort constants have used cepheids to investigate the velocity field on large scales ( @xmath14 ) with a kinematically - cold stellar tracer population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because the relative contribution to the velocity pattern from the sun s peculiar motion to that from galactic rotation diminishes as the inverse of the distance , the intrinsic velocity field can be more easily determined from such large - scale observations .",
    "however , higher - order contributions to the velocity field become important at large distances and the derived values for the oort constants may not reflect their local value , especially because the local velocity distribution appears to be strongly shaped by non - axisymmetric motions @xcite .",
    "local measurements require large stellar samples with good velocity measurements .",
    "@xcite attempted a local measurement using proper motions from the tycho-2 catalog @xcite that was complicated by the unknown distance distribution at different @xmath8 , which produces spurious terms in the velocity pattern that are difficult to distinguish from the effects of galactic rotation .",
    "the _ gaia _ mission @xcite has recently released its first set of data , including parallaxes and proper motions for about 2 million tycho-2 stars as part of the tycho-@xmath15 astrometric solution ( tgas , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this large set of astrometric measurements allow the first truly local precise measurement of the oort constants as discussed in @xmath16  [ sec : method ] .",
    "i describe the data used in this paper in detail in @xmath16  [ sec : data ] and the measurement of the oort constants in @xmath16  [ sec : oort ] .",
    "i discuss the results in @xmath16  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the oort constants are defined based on the velocity field of ( hypothetical ) closed orbits . due to heating by spiral structure and molecular - cloud interactions ,",
    "stellar orbits are not closed and a range of peri- and apogalacticons are present at the solar radius for any stellar population .",
    "therefore , the mean velocity field does not coincide with that for closed orbits and the measured oort constants are different from the true oort constants .",
    "i will refer to the `` oort constants '' throughout this paper , but it should be understood that the data always measure the oort constants for the given stellar population .",
    "corrections to the measured oort constants to bring them closer to the true oort constants are discussed in @xmath16  [ sec : oort ] .",
    "the oort constants may be measured from the longitudinal and latitudinal proper motions of stars near the sun .",
    "to first order in an expansion of the velocity field in distance from the sun , we have that the proper motions of stars with parallaxes @xmath17 depends on @xmath18 as @xmath19 and @xmath20 + \\mathrm{scatter}\\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the sun s motion with respect to the stellar population and @xmath22 are the oort constants . in these expressions",
    ", @xmath23 is the mean rotational and radial velocity , respectively , of the stellar population in galactocentric cylindrical coordinates with the sun at @xmath24 ( see @xcite for an elegant derivation of these relations ) .",
    "in an axisymmetric galaxy , azimuthal derivatives as well as @xmath25 are zero , such that @xmath26 and @xmath4 and @xmath27 provide direct measurements of the angular rotation frequency @xmath28 at the sun and the local slope of the rotation curve @xmath29 .",
    "it is clear from the expressions in equations  ( [ eq : pml ] ) and ( [ eq : pmb ] ) that the oort constants can be measured purely based on astrometric quantities @xmath30 .",
    "all of the astrometric quantities appear in a linear fashion and therefore are well behaved .",
    "for example , it is unnecessary to invert the parallax to obtain a distance for the measurement of the oort constants .",
    "i employ parallaxes and proper motions from the _ gaia _ dr1 tgas catalog , which have typical uncertainties of @xmath31mas and @xmath32masyr@xmath33 .",
    "i only consider the 450,278 tgas sources with relative parallax uncertainties less than @xmath34 and with inverse parallaxes less than 500 pc to select a local sample . in order to separate stellar populations into kinematically colder and warmer populations , i use",
    "matched photometry from apass @xcite for the 355,753 stars with apass photometry to construct the @xmath35 color  magnitude diagram displayed in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "i select main - sequence stars using the cuts shown in this figure , which creates a sample of 315,946 stars .    for this sample ,",
    "i convert the proper motions in equatorial coordinates to galactic coordinates and propagate the proper - motion uncertainty covariance matrix through this transformation as well .",
    "proper motions in masyr@xmath33 are converted to units of @xmath36 by multiplying them by @xmath37 . in what follows ,",
    "i ignore the correlation between the measurements of the parallax and the galactic proper motions , because the scatter in the proper motions is dominated by intrinsic scatter ( the intrinsic scatter is @xmath38 due to the small distance range of the sample versus typical measurement uncertainties @xmath39 ) . decorrelating the parallax and proper motion errors by adding random , uncorrelated noise that is four times larger than the formal uncertainties gives changes in the inferred oort constants below @xmath40 .",
    "i fit the model in equations  ( [ eq : pml ] ) and ( [ eq : pmb ] ) to the data sliced in @xmath41mag bins in @xmath42 using as free parameters @xmath43 and two free parameters describing the gaussian scatter in @xmath44 .",
    "the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 are constrained by both components of the proper motions ; fitting them separately to @xmath47 and @xmath48 gives consistent results for all four of these .",
    "i determine the uncertainty in the best - fit parameters using markov chain monte carlo with flat priors on all parameters .",
    "note that all parameters except for the scatter terms are linear parameters whose probability distribution at fixed scatter could be obtained analytically , but because we need to fit for the non - linear scatter parameters i do not make use of this simplification .    the best - fitting model to four color bins",
    "is compared to the @xmath47 data in figure  [ fig : pml ] .",
    "the observed proper motions in this figure have been corrected for the solar motion @xmath49 using the best - fit parameters  because the solar motion is the dominant effect on @xmath50 that obscures the galactic rotation contribution  as follows @xmath51\\right)\\big/\\cos b\\,,\\ ] ] such that the mean @xmath52 .",
    "the data is binned to display the mean @xmath53 because of the large scatter of individual data points .",
    "because of the @xmath54 correction , i only show stars with @xmath55 in figure  [ fig : pml ] that are most valuable to the inference , even though stars at all @xmath56 are used in the fit .",
    "the proper motion in galactic latitude is much more tenuously related to the parameters of galactic rotation because of the @xmath57 factor in equations  ( [ eq : pmb ] ) .",
    "therefore , i only compare the data and the model in figure  [ fig : pmb ] for the single @xmath42 bin where enough stars at intermediate @xmath56 are present to allow for a straightforward data  model comparison .",
    "similar to figure  [ fig : pml ] , the proper motion in figure  [ fig : pmb ] is corrected for the solar motion as follows @xmath58\\right)\\big/(\\sin b \\cos b)\\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] such that the mean @xmath59 .",
    "the data is again binned to display the mean trend and i restrict the sample to stars with @xmath60 , even though stars at all @xmath56 are used in the fit .",
    "overall the data display good agreement with the simple first - order velocity model in both @xmath50 and @xmath61 .",
    "the posterior probability distribution for the oort and solar - motion parameters displays no correlations among any of the parameters , as expected from the full and close to uniform coverage in @xmath8 of the stars in the tgas sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : ab ] shows the measurements of @xmath4 , @xmath27 , and @xmath62 , which is equal to the rotational frequency @xmath63 if the galaxy were axisymmetric , as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "the different color bins display excellent agreement with each other , except for the very bluest stars , which are likely affect by residual streaming motions from birth .",
    "i combine the four bins blueward of @xmath64 ( except for the bluest bin ) which contain the majority of the stars in the sample ( 304,267 out 315,946 ) to obtain a single value of the oort constants .",
    "the combined measurements are : @xmath65 , @xmath66 as well as @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    because stars are not on closed orbits , their mean velocity and the gradients of their mean velocities are not equal to those for the closed orbits that technically define the true oort constants",
    ". it can be shown that the deviation from the true oort constants is proportional to the asymmetric drift , with a factor of @xmath69 and of @xmath70 for @xmath4 and @xmath27 , respectively , where @xmath71 is the exponential radial scale length of the radial velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "assuming that the solar motion in @xmath72 with respect to a closed orbit is @xmath73 @xcite , the asymmetric drift @xmath74 for all of the main @xmath42 populations that i consider is @xmath75 , such that the correction to @xmath27 is negligible for any reasonable @xmath71 . fitting a linear relation between @xmath4 and the asymmetric drift for the four main @xmath42 bins finds a slope that has the wrong sign compared to the theoretical prediction and a corresponding best estimate of the true @xmath4 of @xmath76 . forcing the correction to be @xmath77 with @xmath78",
    "gives @xmath79 . because we do not see the expected trend between @xmath4 and the asymmetric drift , i therefore assign a systematic uncertainty of @xmath80 to the measurement of @xmath4 .",
    "the measurements of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are displayed in figure  [ fig : ck ] .",
    "like for @xmath4 and @xmath27 , the measurements of @xmath81 and @xmath82 in different color bins agree with each other , although the formal combined uncertainty is again less than half of the scatter between the different measurements and i again use the latter as a conservative uncertainty estimate .",
    "the measurements are : @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the reason that the uncertainty in @xmath82 is larger than that in the other parameters is that it can only be determined from the behavior of @xmath61 .",
    "i also find that @xmath85 .",
    "the best - fitting @xmath81 and @xmath82 are therefore both significantly non - zero , indicating that the local kinematics is non - axisymmetric .",
    "there is no trend in color for either @xmath81 or @xmath82 , in disagreement with the previous measurements from @xcite .",
    "i have measured the oort constants using astrometric measurements for 304,267 local ( typical distance of 230 pc ) main - sequence stars from the _ gaia _ dr1 tgas catalog : @xmath86    these measurements for @xmath4 and @xmath27 are in good agreement with those obtained from modeling the hipparcos proper motions of cepheids : @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "the measurement of @xmath4 is also in good agreement with that measured from the line - of - sight velocities of cepheids : @xmath89 @xcite . unlike these measurements ,",
    "the current measurements are based on a sample of stars within a few 100 pc from the sun and thus truly measure the local velocity field .",
    "the tgas data also allow a confident measurement of @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "there are only a few previous measurements of these constants .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath81 from the tycho-2 proper motions , correcting for the influence of the unknown distance distribution , and found @xmath90 and that @xmath81 is more negative for older , kinematically - warmer populations .",
    "we find that @xmath91 with no dependence on the color or velocity dispersion of the stellar population .",
    "previous measurements of @xmath82 using young stars find that it is negative with typical values in the range @xmath92 to @xmath93 @xcite in agreement with the present measurement .",
    "the measurement of @xmath94 is in good agreement with the measurement of the local mean - radial - velocity gradient from rave @xcite .    that @xmath81 and @xmath82 are both non - zero for all color - selected stellar populations provides strong evidence that the local velocity field is significantly affected by non - axisymmetric forces .",
    "the localized nature of the measurements using the tgas sample makes these measurements straightforward constraints on any large - scale non - axisymmetric model such as the bar or spiral arms , in which the oort constants may simply be evaluated at the position of the sun and compared to these measurements . for example , for no plausible model with a triaxial bulge or halo in which closed orbits are elliptical do @xmath81 and @xmath82 have the same sign @xcite , such that this model on its own is inconsistent with the current measurements . for an axisymmetric disk plus bar model with the bar s outer lindblad resonance near the sun  which can explain the hercules moving group in the local velocity distribution @xcite@xmath81 and @xmath82 are both negative with @xmath95 ( computed using ` galpy ` ; @xcite ) , although kinematically - colder populations in this model respond differently to the bar perturbation and give different @xmath81 @xcite , which is not observed in the tgas data .",
    "more sophisticated modeling is required to better interpret the measurements of the oort constants presented here .",
    "while the measurements presented here only provide information on the local gravitational field , they may still be usefully employed in the modeling of non - axisymmetric perturbations to the local dynamics .",
    "the oort constants @xmath4 and @xmath27 can be used in the sheared sheet approximation to the local dynamics @xcite to efficiently determine the effect of different non - axisymmetric forces ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this may help elucidate the local non - axisymmetric dynamics from the @xmath98 million stars within a few 100 pc from the sun with full velocity measurements in future releases of the _ gaia _ data .",
