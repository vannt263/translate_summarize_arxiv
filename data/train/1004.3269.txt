    "it is believed that the standard model ( sm ) of the electroweak and strong interactions is not the complete theory because it does not explain some theoretical features , for example the family replication .",
    "this motivates the formulation of many theoretical extensions of the sm .",
    "for example , the issue for the family replication problem and for the bound on the weinberg angle is proposed in @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "the sm is in accordance with all available experimental data from lep , sld and tevatron and , apart from the higgs particle , all predicted particles have been discovered .",
    "it is expected , in a near future , that the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will reach a higher energy and luminosity regime opening the possibility to find the responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism and to reveal phenomena related to new physics , such as the existence of new particles .",
    "many alternative models predict the existence of new and exotic particles . among them",
    ", the new neutral gauge boson called @xmath9 appears in the 3 - 3 - 1 models @xcite , little higgs model @xcite , left - right symmetric models @xcite , superstring inspired e@xmath10 model @xcite and models with extra dimensions as kaluza - klein excitations of neutral gauge bosons @xcite .    the search for @xmath9 will play an important part in the proposals of future high - energy colliders .",
    "it is expected that lhc will be able to look for a @xmath9 up to @xmath11 tev , however only the next generation of linear colliders ( ilc ) , dealing with polarized beams and with @xmath12 gev will be able to confirm its existence _ via _ interference effects and to perform more precise measurements .",
    "unfortunately the @xmath9 mass is not predicted in any model but the minimal version of 3 - 3 - 1 model imposes an upper bound around @xmath13 tev for this parameter what makes the model very attractive under the experimental point of view .",
    "the acceptable current lower bound is @xmath14 gev and it is strongly model dependent @xcite .",
    "previous results from interference effects , at lep , and from direct production , at the tevatron , show that @xmath9 is expected to be very heavy , having a small mixing with @xmath15 . some improvements on its mass and mixing",
    "have recently been obtained for some models from electroweak precision data @xcite .    a safe way to search a @xmath9",
    "is to follow the same procedure adopted for discovering @xmath15 gauge boson . in this case",
    ", the searches must cover a range for an invariant dilepton mass higher than @xmath16 .",
    "the signature for its existence is obtained directly from proton - proton and @xmath17 collisions analyzing the distributions of @xmath9 decay products . once discovered the particle",
    ", one has to determine its main properties : mass , natural width , charge and spin .    in order to confirm the @xmath9 existence",
    ", we have to collect a bulk of observable showing its signature .",
    "all these observable must come from the distributions of its decay products . as emphasized by @xcite , the forward - backward asymmetry ( a@xmath18 ) final states distribution can reveal an axial coupling of @xmath9 to fermions , then showing a clear signature .",
    "as it is known the @xmath9 rapidity measurements can tell us about its couplings to quarks and leptons @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are proposing to consider another observable allowing for a @xmath9 identification in proton - proton collisions at center of mass ( c.o.m ) energy @xmath19 tev with an annual luminosity of @xmath20 fb@xmath7 .",
    "in addition , we present our results for a possible first stage of lhc operation , namely @xmath21 tev and @xmath22 fb@xmath7 . in this work",
    "we combine the forward - backward and invariant mass distributions with the transverse momentum distribution of the emerging fermions in the processes @xmath1 using some representative models containing @xmath23 .",
    "the present work is organized in the following way : in section 2 we show the couplings between @xmath9 and quarks and leptons for some models , in the section 3 we give our results and finally we present our conclusions .",
    "in our study , we consider three different approaches to physics beyond the sm .",
    "one consider the gut superstring - inspired @xmath24 and their low energy @xmath25 version , @xmath26 .",
    "another approach implies an extension of the sm like the left - right models that appear in order to explain the left - right parity breaking and is based in the gauge group @xmath27 .",
    "finally , we consider an alternative approach to the sm , represented by the models with symmetry @xmath28 , called 3 - 3 - 1 models for short , that give answer to some open questions as the number of families or the electroweak mixing angle value .",
    "the fermion-@xmath23 couplings are specific for each model .",
    "this characteristic is reflected in the width of the new neutral gauge boson , that define a leptophobic or leptophilic character of @xmath23 .",
    "the general lagrangian for the neutral current involving @xmath15 and @xmath23 contributions for the models studied in this article is : & & l^nc = -_f , where @xmath29 can be leptons and quarks and @xmath30 is the weak coupling constant , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the sm couplings , whereas the new couplings @xmath33 and @xmath34 are presented in the tables i and ii . below the electroweak scale ,",
    "the phenomenology predicted by these models involving the @xmath35 and the z , coincides with the sm one ."
