    "the discovery of a pulsar whose period changes significantly usually indicates that it is a member of a binary system .",
    "it is then important to determine the keplerian orbital parameters of the system in order to investigate the astrophysics of the two stars and to obtain a coherent timing solution for the rotation of the pulsar .",
    "the latter provides precise astrometric information as well as the period derivative which may give information on the magnetic flux density and age of the pulsar or , if it is in a globular cluster , on the gravitational field of the cluster @xcite .",
    "the usual procedure for obtaining orbital parameters involves fitting a keplerian model to a series of period measurements .",
    "such a procedure works well , provided that it is possible to determine the rotational period on several occasions during a single orbit .",
    "however , there are often circumstances where this is not the case , such as where interstellar scintillation permits only sparse positive detections of a pulsar @xcite .",
    "we have therefore sought a way of employing the hitherto unused information contained in the measured orbital accelerations to obtain a full , coherent solution for the keplerian orbital parameters .    in what follows ,",
    "we present a simple procedure for estimating the orbital parameters of a binary that is completely independent of the distribution of the epochs of the individual observations , provided that the period derivatives are known in each observation . in section [ sec : general ] , we present the equations for the period and acceleration of a pulsar in an eccentric binary system as a function of its position in the orbit .",
    "we also provide an analysis of the circular case and show how the orbital parameters can be obtained from a plot of the acceleration of the pulsars against rotational period . in section [ sec : app ] , we demonstrate the application of the procedure to a number of pulsars in the globular cluster 47  tucanae which have known orbital parameters , and then to 47  tuc  s and t , neither of which hitherto had an orbital solution . in section [ sec : refining ] , we show how to improve the estimates of the orbital parameters , and proceed to refine the orbits of 47  tuc  s and t.",
    "( 0,5 ) ( -2.5,0 )    figure [ fig : orbit ] represents the orbit of a binary pulsar ( point p ) around the centre of mass of the system ( o ) projected onto a plane that contains the direction towards the earth ( i.e. , perpendicular to the plane of the sky , @xmath0 ) , and the line of nodes where the orbital plane intersects @xmath0 .",
    "the orbit is an ellipse of eccentricity @xmath1 and projected semi - major axis @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the unknown inclination of the orbit relative to the plane of the sky ) . *",
    "r * is the vector connecting o to p , and @xmath4 is the distance of the pulsar to o , @xmath5 is the projection of this to the line - of - sight .",
    "@xmath6 is the longitude of periastron and @xmath7 is the angle of the pulsar to the periastron measured at o , also called `` true anomaly '' . according to roy ( 1988 ) ,",
    "the equation for @xmath8 as a function of @xmath7 is given by    @xmath9    the time derivative of @xmath8 is the line - of - sight ( or radial ) velocity , @xmath10 . using the results in roy ( 1988 ) ,",
    "we obtain :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the orbital period of the binary .",
    "the apparent rotational period of the pulsar @xmath13 as a function of @xmath7 and the intrinsic rotational period @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 if the total velocity of the pulsar , @xmath16 is small compared to @xmath17 .",
    "differentiating equation [ eq : vl ] in time , we obtain the acceleration along the line of sight @xmath18 as a function of @xmath7 @xmath19    ( 0,5.5 ) ( -3.7,-0.3 )    plotting @xmath20 as a function of @xmath21 , we obtain a parametric curve that does not depend on time , and therefore does not require the solution of kepler s equation .",
    "this curve is illustrated in figure [ fig : accp ] for a binary pulsar of spin period 10 ms and orbital parameters @xmath1 = 0.9 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 = 1 day and @xmath24 .",
    "all known binaries containing `` true '' millisecond pulsars , i.e. , those with periods below 20 ms , have rather circular orbits @xcite . for these",
    ", we can set @xmath25 = 0 in the equations above , so that equations [ eq : p ] and [ eq : accel ] reduce to    @xmath26    and @xmath27    the track followed by such pulsars in the period / acceleration space is thus an ellipse centred on the point ( @xmath28 , 0 ) and having as horizontal and vertical semi - axes the values @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , with the pulsar moving in a clockwise direction .    generally , once an ellipse has been found to fit a set of measurements of barycentric period and acceleration for a given pulsar , we can easily recover the two relevant orbital parameters in a circular orbit :    @xmath31    @xmath32    using these newly determined orbital parameters , we can calculate the angular orbital phase for each @xmath33th data point , i.e.  for each pair of acceleration and period measured ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) :    @xmath36    since the time @xmath37 of each observation is also known , we can determine the time of the nearest ascending node , or simply @xmath38 for each observation :    @xmath39    we can use these values to refine the orbital period ( section [ sec : refining ] ) .",
    "in this section , we first test the procedure described above on a number of known binary systems in the globular cluster 47  tucanae and then apply it to two systems with hitherto unknown orbits .    between august 1997 and august 1999 , the 64-m parkes radio telescope was used to make a total of 108 observations of the pulsars in the globular cluster 47  tucanae ( henceforth 47  tuc ) at a central frequency of 1374mhz ( @xmath40 cm ) .",
    "about half of these observations were of 4.6 hours duration , the remainder were shorter .",
    "these data have been used to make accurate timing measurements of the pulsars in 47  tuc , the long integrations being required in order to detect the very faint pulsars ( freire et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , it can also be used to search for previously undetected pulsars @xcite using an analysis which searches over a range of different accelerations .    in a first search , targeted at binaries with periods as short as 90 minutes ,",
    "each of these 4.6-hour observations was divided into sixteen 17.4-minute segments , and an acceleration search was performed on each segment .",
    "the trial accelerations ranged from @xmath4130 m s@xmath42 to 30 m s@xmath42 , with a step of 0.3 m s@xmath42 .",
    "this search was remarkably successful , with the discovery of nine new millisecond pulsars , all of which are binary @xcite .",
    "this increased the total number of known pulsars in 47  tuc to 20 .",
    "all have periods between 2 and 8 ms , and 13 are members of binary systems .",
    "the reason that new pulsars are still being found in 47  tuc is that the pulsars scintillate strongly at 1374 mhz , with flux density variations over more than one order of magnitude in a few hours .",
    "this occasionally increases the flux density of a weak pulsar above the sensitivity threshold of the parkes radio telescope , making it detectable for perhaps one or two hours in the 17.4-minute sub - integrations .",
    "if a newly discovered binary system has an orbital period comparable to the length of an observation , then it is possible to make a unique determination of the orbital parameters of the pulsar using data from a single observation .",
    "however , some of the newly - discovered binaries ( e.g. 47  tuc  s and t ) have longer orbital periods .",
    "thus far , it has been impossible to determine the orbital parameters of these binaries , because we can not choose when to observe them - that is primarily determined by scintillation , and detections of these pulsars are very rare ( 47  tuc  s was detected on a single observation , and 47  tuc  t on three observations in the 17.4-minute search ) .",
    "more importantly , the extremely sparse successful detections typically occur once every few hundred orbits .",
    "for these two pulsars , the number of detections has been increased to 4 and 7 respectively , by dividing the observations into 4 70-minute segments and conducting acceleration searches on each of these , so increasing the sensitivity by a factor of 2 over the search of camilo et al .",
    "these detections are summarised in table [ tab : detections ] , but unfortunately are still much too sparse to determine a unique orbit from the period determinations alone .    .",
    "measured periods and accelerations for 47  tuc  s and t. s is detected on four different observations of 47  tuc , t is detected on 7 different observations .",
    "this represents a total of 6 and 9 measurements of period and acceleration respectively",
    ". the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) varies due to scintillation . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     with these new , improved @xmath12 and @xmath43 , the orbital parameters can be refined even further , using conventional fitting to period and , after that stage , more precise periods derived from times - of arrival of pulses ( see freire et al . 2000 , section 2 ) . in section 3 of that paper",
    "we present a phase - coherent timing solution for 47  tuc  t ; for 47  tuc  s the best solution is :    @xmath13 = 2.830406030(3 ) ms ,    @xmath12 = 1.20172465(7 ) days ,    @xmath44 = 0.766338(9 ) s ,    @xmath43 = 51000.964588(8 ) ( mjd ) .",
    "no eccentricity has been detected .",
    "the procedure outlined in section [ sec : general ] and appendix a is useful even when the binary s orbit is well - sampled , because it provides automatically a `` first guess '' of the orbital parameters , which can then be used in conventional period analysis .",
    "the quality of this guess obviously depends on phase coverage and the precision of the measurement of accelerations .",
    "the procedure presented in this paper is , however , the only one capable of giving any estimates of the orbital parameters when the data samples the orbital period sparsely . for this purpose ,",
    "the epochs of the individual period / acceleration measurements are completely irrelevant as long as the measurements have reasonable orbital phase coverage ; their values are only needed to make the appropriate period corrections to the barycentre of the solar system .",
    "we thank the skilled and dedicated telescope staff at parkes for their support during this project , and vicky kaspi , froney crawford , ingrid stairs , fernando camilo and jon bell for assistance with observations we also thank n. wex for very stimulating discussions , from which the techniques in appendix a emerged .",

    "fitting an ellipse to a set of points can be quite cumbersome , at least from a computational point of view .",
    "however , eqns .",
    "( [ eq : pcirc ] ) and ( [ eq : acirc ] ) can be combined to derive a simple expression , which is linear in the unknown parameters and hence easy to fit . by squaring each of the equations , multiplying one of the squares by an appropriate constant and summing them , we obtain the simple equation of a parabola , given in the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath13 represent acceleration and period . it is straightforward to model the set of squares of the observed accelerations and the corresponding periods , ( @xmath48 , @xmath35 ) by applying a linear least squares fitting algorithm .",
    "we use the singular value decomposition method , as for instance described by press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , to determine the coefficients @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    ", we use in fact a scaled version of those during the fit to avoid numerical problems , i.e.  we use an expression @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a constant and @xmath54 the mean of all measured @xmath35 s . ] the period and the orbital parameters are then given by          despite the simplicity of the problem , there are large covariances among the fitted parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , making it difficult to obtain reliable error estimates for the derived parameters .",
    "for this reason , we employed a monte - carlo method in our fitting algorithm , which provides not only precise values of the orbital parameters but also reliable and realistic estimates of their uncertainties . to achieve this",
    ", we generate a total of 10000 synthetic data sets , each having the same number of observations as the original set of real observations . for a given synthetic data set , the generated random periods and accelerations",
    "are gaussian distributed while centred on the real observed data points , with dispersions given by the observational uncertainties .",
    "we perform the described fit algorithm for each synthetic data set and obtain probability distributions for the orbital parameters as shown in figure [ fig : distributions ] for the case of 47  tuc  w. we choose the maximum of each probability distribution as our best fit value of a given orbital parameter and calculate its uncertainty from the spread in its distribution .",
    "the reliability of this method is demonstrated in table [ tab : parameters ] where we compare the parameters obtained using this method ( columns 2 to 4 ) with the parameters as determined in the subsequent timing analysis ( columns 5 to 8) .",
    "the timing method provides far more precise values , however the comparison clearly demonstrates that our new method provides accurate values and calculates reasonable error estimates ."
