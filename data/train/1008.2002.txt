    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close interacting binary systems in which a white dwarf ( wd ) accretes material from a roche lobe filling late - type secondary star @xcite . in most non - magnetic cvs ( @xmath3 ) , the material lost from the secondary does not directly fall onto the wd because of its large specific orbital momentum : instead , it settles down in an accretion disc around the wd .",

    "most of the photometric data was acquired in the _ i@xmath8 _  band , which contains contribution from both the m - dwarf  and a cyclotron harmonic from the emission region near the wd .",
    "lower panel : expected fourier transform for a pure sinusoidal variations with a period of 60.11min , obtained by scaling and convolving the fourier transform of the window function with a delta function corresponding to the best - fit period . ]    a fourier transform of the data ( figure [ fig : jointfourier ] ) shows a strong peak at sixty minutes .",
    "we interpret this as a harmonic of the orbital period .",
    "to determine the exact period , we analyze the data as follows . as the object has a short orbital period , we convert all times to heliocentric julian date for analysis .",
    "we fit a sinusoid ( @xmath84/p)$ ] ) to each epoch , allowing @xmath85 and @xmath86 to vary independently for each epoch , but we use the same reference time @xmath80 and period @xmath82 for the entire fit .",
    "the mean magnitude is correlated with the amplitude ( figure [ fig : meanamplitude ] ) .",
    "note that the amplitude measured for the sinusoidal approximation for each epoch is always less than the actual peak - to - peak variations of the source during that epoch , as expected .",
    "the source is in the active state in the first few epochs , and we exclude epochs 15 from the fit , to avoid contamination from the accretion stream and/or the accretion shock .",
    "the best - fit solution is overplotted in blue in figures [ fig : p60phot1 ] & [ fig : lfcphot ] .",
    "since epochs 15 were not included in the fit , a sinusoid is overplotted in dashed green to indicate the expected phase of the variations .",
    "the best - fit period is @xmath87 minutes .",
    "this formally differs from the spectroscopically determined orbital period by @xmath88 .",
    "however , this error estimate includes only statistical errors .",
    "there is some , difficult to determine , systematic error component in addition , so we do not claim any significant inconsistency .    periodic photometric variability for 1rxs  j1730",
    "+ 03  can be explained as a combination of two effects : cyclotron emission from the accretion region and ellipsoidal modulation .",
    "the active state is characterized by a higher mass transfer rate from the donor to the wd , and results in higher cyclotron emission .",
    "this emission is beamed nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field lines , creating an emission fan beam .",
    "for high inclination systems , the observer crosses this fan beam twice , causing two high amplitude peaks per orbit ( figure [ fig : p60photcompare ] ) . in the active state",
    "when the emission is dominated by cyclotron radiation , the minimum leads the superior conjuntion by @xmath89 .    in ellipsoidal modulation , and the photometric minima coincide with the superior conjunction .",
    "it is observed that in quiescence , the photometric minimum leads the superior conjunction of the white dwarf by @xmath90 .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath91mag variation is caused by a combination of ellipsoidal modulation and cyclotron emission from the accretion region .",
    "the semi - amplitude of the m - dwarf radial velocity , k2 , gives a lower limit on the mass of the white dwarf . for a circular orbit",
    ", one can derive from kepler s laws that : @xmath92 tighter constraints can be placed on the individual component masses @xmath93 , @xmath94 by considering the geometry of the system . @xcite expresses the volume radius @xmath95 of the secondary in terms of the mass ratio @xmath96 : @xmath97 where the separation of the components is given by @xmath98^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "thus for a fixed period @xmath82 , @xmath95 depends only on @xmath94 .",
    "the radius of the white dwarf is much smaller than that of the m - dwarf .",
    "hence , the m - dwarf  will eclipse the accretion region if the inclination of the system is @xmath99 .",
    "figures [ fig : p60phot1 ] , [ fig : lfcphot ] show that we do not detect any eclipses in the system .",
    "figure [ fig : inclination ] shows the allowed region for 1rxs  j1730 + 03  in a wd mass  m - dwarf  mass phase space .",
    "the orange dotted region is excluded as the orbital velocity would be greater than the measured projected velocity .",
    "the red hatched region is excluded by non - detection of eclipses .",
    "the allowed mass of the primary ranges from the minimum mass ( @xmath100 ) to the chandrashekhar limit .",
    "the mass of the secondary is bounded above by the zams mass for a m3 dwarf ( @xmath101 ) .        for a given @xmath94 and a known orbital period",
    ", we can determine the radius of the secondary using equation ( [ eq : r2 ] ) , and can calculate the surface gravity ( @xmath37 ) . for @xmath102 , @xmath37 ranges from 5.1 to 4.8 .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath39 for the best fit m - dwarf  spectrum ( section[subsec : mdwarf ] ) .",
    "the donor stars in cvs are expected to co - rotate . for 1rxs  j1730 + 03",
    ", the highest possible rotational velocity @xmath103 is @xmath104 for a @xmath40 , @xmath105 m - dwarf  and a @xmath106 wd ( figure [ fig : inclination ] ) .",
    "@xmath103 will be lower if the wd is heavier or if the m - dwarf  is lighter . to measure rotational broadening in the spectra",
    ", we use a higher resolution ( @xmath107 ) template of the best - fit model from @xcite .",
    "we take a template with zero rotation velocity and broaden it to different rotational velocities using the prescription by @xcite .",
    "then we use our fitting procedure ( section[subsec : mdwarf ] ) to find the best - fit value for @xmath103 . for this measurement ,",
    "we use only the 12 relatively high resolution spectra from the second lris epoch ( ut 2009 june 16 ) .",
    "the weighted @xmath103 from the twelve spectra is @xmath108 , but the measurements show high scatter , with a standard deviation of @xmath109 .",
    "we compared our broadened spectra with rotationally broadened spectra computed by @xcite , and found that our methods systematically underestimate @xmath103 by @xmath110 .",
    "we do not understand the reason for this discrepancy , hence do not feel confident enough to use this value in our analysis . a reliable measurement of @xmath103 will help better constrain the masses of the two components .",
    "we estimate the distance to 1rxs  j1730 + 03  as follows .",
    "our fitting procedure ( section[subsec : mdwarf ] ) corrects for extinction and separates the wd and m - dwarf  components of the spectra .",
    "we correct for varying sky conditions by using a reference star on the slit .",
    "the ratio of measured flux to the flux of the best fit model atmosphere ( @xmath111 ) is , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the distance to the source , and @xmath95 is given by equation ( [ eq : r2 ] ) .    for 1rxs  j1730 + 03",
    ", the maximum mass of the m - dwarf  is @xmath40 , and the corresponding radius is @xmath114 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : distanceratio ] ) then gives @xmath115 .",
    "this calculation assumes the largest possible m - dwarf  radius , hence is an upper limit to distance .",
    "if the m - dwarf  is lighter , say @xmath116 , we get @xmath117 , yielding @xmath118 .",
    "1rxs  j173006.4 + 033813  is a polar cataclysmic variable , similar to known well - studied systems like bl hyi , st lmi and ww hor in terms of the orbital period , magnetic field and variability between active and quiescent states .",
    "this source is notable for the highly symmetric nature and high amplitude of the double  peaked variation in the active state .",
    "this suggests a relatively high angle between the rotation and magnetic axes .",
    "polarimetric observations of the source would help to better constrain the magnetic field geometry of the system .",
    "most polars are discovered due to their highly variable x - ray flux .",
    "however , we mounted a followup campaign for 1rxs  j1730 + 03  due to its unusual optical variability properties .",
    "this suggests that current and future optical synoptic surveys , such as ptf @xcite and lsst can uncover a large sample of polars by cross - correlating opticaly variable objects with the rosat catalog .",
