    "there is much interest in trying to understand the structure of hadrons , both mesons and baryons , in terms of their constituents , the quarks and gluons .",
    "however , this structure is too complicated to be calculated rigorously in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) because perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) methods are not applicable in the confinement regime .",
    "chiral perturbation theory can give valuable insights , but it is limited to small values of the photon virtuality .",
    "hence , in the intermediate  regime one has to resort to models like the constituent quark model or methods employing light - cone ( lc ) dynamics or the bethe - salpeter ( plus dyson - schwinger ) equation , or to other approaches such as the use of dispersion relations or ( qcd or lc ) sum rules .",
    "transitions and ( transition ) form factors are crucial elements for gauging the ideas underlying these qcd - based models .",
    "for example , the constituent quark model gives a fairly good description of the meson and baryon spectrum and some transitions , but quark effective form factors are typically required when describing hadronic form factors in the experimentally accessible  region . in this framework , the study of hadronic form factors can thus be viewed as a study of the transition from constituent to current quark degrees of freedom . as exemplified by the many calculations of it ,",
    "the electric form factor of the pion , , is one of the best observables for the investigation of the transition of qcd effective degrees of freedom in the soft regime , governed by all kinds of quark - gluon correlations at low , to the perturbative ( including next - to - leading order and transverse corrections ) regime at higher .",
    "in contrast to the nucleon , the asymptotic normalization of the pion wave function is known from pion decay .",
    "the hard part of the @xmath3 form factor can be calculated within the framework of pqcd as the sum of logarithms and powers of @xcite    @xmath4 , \\label{eqn : pqcd}\\ ] ]    which in the @xmath5 limit becomes @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 mev is the pion decay constant @xcite .",
    "because the pion s @xmath8 valence structure is relatively simple , the transition from `` soft '' ( non - perturbative ) to `` hard '' ( perturbative ) qcd is expected to occur at significantly lower values of  for  than for the nucleon form factors @xcite .",
    "some estimates @xcite suggest that pqcd contributions to the pion form factor are already significant at @xmath9 . on the other hand",
    ", a recent analysis @xcite indicates that non - perturbative contributions dominate the pion form factor up to relatively large values of , giving more than half of the pion form factor up to = 20 .",
    "thus , there is an ongoing theoretical debate on the interplay of these hard and soft components at intermediate , and high quality experimental data are needed to help guide this discussion .    in this work ,",
    "we concentrate exclusively on the spacelike region of the pion form factor . for recent measurements in the timelike region see ref . @xcite . at low values of , where it is governed by the charge radius of the pion ,",
    "has been determined up to = 0.253  @xcite from the scattering of high - energy pions by atomic electrons . for the determination of the pion form factor at higher values of",
    ", one has to use high - energy electroproduction of pions on a nucleon , i.e. , employ the @xmath0h@xmath1 reaction . for selected kinematic conditions ,",
    "the longitudinal cross section is very sensitive to the pion form factor . in this way",
    ", data for  have been obtained for values of  up to 10  at cornell  @xcite .",
    "however , those data suffer from relatively large statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "more precise data were obtained at the deutsches elektronen - synchrotron ( desy ) @xcite . with the availability of high - intensity electron beams , combined with accurate magnetic spectrometers at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) , it has been possible to determine l / t separated cross sections with high precision .",
    "the measurement of these cross sections in the regime of = 0.60 - 1.60  [ experiment fpi-1 @xcite ] and = 1.60 - 2.45  [ experiment fpi-2 @xcite ] are described in detail in the preceding paper @xcite . in this paper , it is discussed how to determine  from measured longitudinal cross sections , the values determined from the jlab and desy data are presented , and the results of various theoretical calculations are compared with the experimental data .    since the pion in the proton is virtual ( off its mass - shell ) , the extraction of  from the measured electroproduction cross sections requires some model or procedure . in the next section ,",
    "the methods that have been used to determine  from the data are discussed .",
    "section [ sec : fpi_vgl ] presents the adopted extraction method and the values of  thus determined , including a full discussion of the uncertainties resulting from the experimental data and those from the adopted extraction procedure .",
    "various model calculations of  are discussed and compared to the data in section [ sec : models ] . in the final section ,",
    "some conclusions are drawn and an outlook for the future is given .",
    "the measurement of the pion form factor is challenging . as stated in the introduction , at low",
    "can be measured in a model - independent manner via the elastic scattering of @xmath3 from atomic electrons , such as has been done up to = 0.253  at fermilab @xcite and at the cern sps @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to access significantly higher values of  with this technique because of limitations in the energy of the pion beam together with the unfavorable momentum transfer .",
    "therefore , at higher values of  must be determined from pion electroproduction on the proton .",
    "the dependence on  enters the cross section via the @xmath10-channel process , in which the incident electron scatters from a virtual pion , bringing it on - shell .",
    "this process dominates near the pion - pole at @xmath11 , where @xmath10 is the mandelstam variable .",
    "the physical region for @xmath10 in pion electroproduction is negative , so measurements should be performed at the smallest attainable values of @xmath12 . to minimize background contributions , it is also necessary to separate out the longitudinal cross section , via a rosenbluth l / t(/lt / tt ) separation @xcite .",
    "the minimum physical value of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , is non - zero and increases with increasing  and decreasing value of the invariant mass , @xmath14 , of the produced pion - nucleon system .",
    "carlson and milana @xcite have estimated an approximate upper limit for the value of @xmath13 of the data appropriate for the extraction of the pion form factor by studying the competing non - pole qcd processes , which may complicate the extraction of  at higher .",
    "they found that the background ratio @xmath15 rises dramatically once @xmath16 .",
    "their concern stemmed from the large value of @xmath12 in some of the cornell results , which have @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "therefore , reliable  measurements should be performed at smaller @xmath12 and thus higher @xmath14 ( for a fixed ) .",
    "the results presented in this paper respect this @xmath18  upper limit .",
    "it is yet to be determined if reliable  measurements can be made in the future at larger @xmath12 .",
    "the value of @xmath19 can then be determined from the data by trying to extrapolate the measured longitudinal cross sections at small values of @xmath12 to the pole at @xmath20 , or by comparing the measured longitudinal cross section at small values of @xmath12 to the best available model for the @xmath0h@xmath1 reaction , adjusting the value of  in the latter .",
    "the presence of the nucleon and its structure complicates the theoretical model used , and so an unavoidable implication of this method is that the extracted pion form factor values are model dependent .",
    "the differential cross sections  versus @xmath10 over some range of  and @xmath14 are the actual observables measured by the experiment .",
    "it is important to note that in all cases the use of a model to extract  is justified only if the model correctly predicts the @xmath10-dependence and magnitude of the  data as well as the dependence on the invariant mass @xmath14 of the photon - nucleon system .",
    "frazer @xcite originally proposed that  be extracted from via a kinematic extrapolation to the pion - pole , and that this be done in an analytical manner using the so called chew - low extrapolation @xcite .",
    "the used born formula is not gauge invariant @xcite , but in principle should give , nonetheless , when extrapolating to the pole .",
    "the last serious attempt to extract the space - like pion form factor from electroproduction data via the chew - low method was by devenish and lyth @xcite in 1972 .",
    "most of the data used were unseparated cross sections .",
    "the extrapolation failed to produce a reliable result , because different polynomial fits that were equally likely in the physical region gave divergent values of the form factor when extrapolated to the pion - pole at @xmath11 .",
    "since then , the quality of the @xmath3 electroproduction data - set has improved immensely , and separated longitudinal cross sections can now be used , avoiding the complications stemming from the other parts of the cross section .",
    "therefore , it has been suggested to us that it may be appropriate to revisit the chew - low extrapolation method .",
    "however , before trying this method on the new data , it should be tested to see how reliably one can extrapolate to the pole .",
    "we start with high precision  ` pseudodata ' generated as a function of @xmath12 with the vgl regge model .",
    "this model gives a fair to good description of a wide body of pion photo- and electroproduction data ( see section  [ sec : vgl ] ) .",
    "the kinematic conditions for the test are @xmath21  and @xmath22 gev , similar to our fpi-2 data .",
    "the input value of the pion form factor in the model was @xmath23 .",
    "the model  cross sections were then used in a chew - low type extrapolation , with the challenge being to see if the chew - low extrapolation is able to reproduce ( within fitting uncertainties ) the input -value .",
    "the basis of the chew - low method is the born - term model ( btm ) formula for the pion - pole contribution to .",
    "we use the btm of actor , korner and bender @xcite , where pion - pole contribution to  is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which depends on the flux factor used in the definition of @xmath27 , is given in our case by @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "a monopole parameterization of the @xmath29 form factor is typically used to determine its value at @xmath10-values away from the pion - pole @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the experimental value of 13.4 @xcite .",
    "this is also the value used in the vgl calculations .",
    "we use the @xmath32 gev result from the qcd sum rules calculation by t. meissner @xcite , but because of the extrapolation to the pole the final result does not depend significantly upon the value chosen .     to the pole as computed from eqn . .",
    "the boxes are a vgl regge model calculation for  at fixed @xmath22 gev and @xmath21 , calculated with = 0.244 .",
    "the lower limit of the box range is the kinematic endpoint of these , @xmath14 values , while the upper limit is given by the @xmath10-range of our experiment .",
    "the input  value in the model is indicated by the bullet placed at the pion - pole .",
    "[ fig : chewlow],width=321 ]    for the chew - low extrapolation , one plots the value of @xmath33 versus @xmath12 , which for a pure pole cross section gives a straight line passing through the origin , with value @xmath19 at the pole ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "other contributions to the cross section , which have to be present , because the pole contribution alone is not gauge invariant , will change this behavior , but since they do not contain the @xmath34 factor , they will not influence the value of @xmath35 at the pole .",
    "however , it is not a priori given that the behavior as function of @xmath12 is linear , quadratic , or of higher order , thus introducing a ` model ' ( extrapolation ) uncertainty .",
    "values of @xmath35 for the generated pseudodata , together with linear , quadratic and cubic extrapolations to the pole are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chewlow ] . also shown is the input form factor value in the vgl model , plotted at the pion - pole .",
    "quadratic and higher - order extrapolations are almost indistinguishable and give a very good description of the ( pseudo)data , but miss the input value of .",
    "this was true for all cases that were investigated , from @xmath36 to 2.45 , the deviation from the input -value being 6 - 15% , depending on the case and the order of the extrapolation polynomial .",
    "overall , there was no consistent trend for the order of polynomial which was best able to reproduce the input form factor value .",
    "this study indicates that even if  is very well known over a range of physically - accessible @xmath10 , the chew low extrapolation yields inconsistent results .",
    "the extrapolated result depends greatly upon the choice of quadratic cubic , or higher - order function , which all give a very good description of the data in the physical region .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath10-dependence of data in the physical region is insufficient to uniquely constrain the extrapolation through the unphysical region to the pole , even if the data have small relative uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , even though modern data such as the jlab  data are much more precise than those previously available , they still comprise 4 - 6 @xmath10-bins only , each with statistical and systematic uncertainties of 5 - 10% .",
    "therefore , any polynomial extrapolation of such data to the pole will be more unreliable than the pseudodata test case shown here .",

    "the poorer description of the  data by the vgl model at lower  and @xmath14 may be due to contributions from resonances , which are not included explicitly in the regge model .",

    "the vgl model gives a rather good description of both the @xmath10 and the @xmath14 dependence of the jlab data at values of @xmath137 , but especially at @xmath36  the fall - off of the data with @xmath12 is steeper than that of the model . in the cases where the vgl model described well the @xmath10-dependence of the  data ,",
    "the value of  was determined by fitting the model to the data .",
    "otherwise , the value of  was determined by extrapolating the fit of the model to @xmath138 .",
    "an additional ` model uncertainty ' has been estimated by using two different assumptions for an interfering background that could be responsible for this discrepancy between the data and vgl model .",
    "the fact that the discrepancy , and hence the model uncertainty , is very small at higher values of  and @xmath14 suggests that effects from nucleon resonances play a role in the data at lower  and @xmath14 .",
    "it is stressed that the cross sections are the actual observables measured by the experiment , and that the extracted values of  are inherently dependent on the model used to extract them .",
    "the development of additional models for the @xmath0h@xmath1 reaction would allow further exploration of the model dependence of the extraction of  from the same cross section data .",
    "on the experimental front , proposed measurements @xcite after the completion of the jlab upgrade are expected to better establish the validity of any used model by investigating , for example , the @xmath14-dependence of the results .",
    "the results for , extracted from our data and from the desy data with the use of the vgl model , are presented together with their experimental and model uncertainties . above @xmath79 ,",
    "these data are systematically below the monopole parameterization based on the empirical pion charge radius .",
    "the data are also compared to a selection of calculations , including those based on pqcd , lattice qcd , dispersion relations , qcd sum rules , bethe - salpeter equation , local quark - hadron duality , constituent - quark model , and holographic qcd .",
    "there has been tremendous progress in the theory of hadronic structure physics in the past decade , as evident by the many new approaches under development . however at present",
    ", the intermediate  regime remains a significant challenge .",
    "several different approaches concur that up to at least = 2.5 , the  data are far above the estimated ` hard ' ( perturbative ) contribution , and that ` soft ' ( non - perturbative ) contributions likely dominate in this region .",
    "data expected to be taken @xcite after the completion of the jlab upgrade , up to at least @xmath139 , are expected to indicate whether the higher - twist mechanisms dominate  until very large momentum transfer , or not .",
