    "the tully - fisher relation ( tfr ; tully & fisher 1977 ) is a strong correlation between the luminosity and the maximum rotation velocity of spiral galaxies .",
    "although its physical origin is not completely understood in detail , the tfr has proved to be a very useful tool to study the evolution of the fundamental properties of spiral galaxies .",
    "vogt et al .  ( 1996 ) showed that using large telescopes with efficient spectrographs it is possible to study the tfr reaching @xmath0 .",
    "following that work , several groups have carried out similar studies for sizeable samples of disk galaxies over a wide range in redshift and environment .",
    "the optical tfr of field galaxies has been studied using slit spectroscopy obtained at the vlt , subaru and keck telescopes by several groups including vogt et al .",

    "these studies find that at a fixed rotation velocity , spiral galaxies appear to be @xmath1@xmath2mag brighter at @xmath0 than at @xmath3 in rest - frame @xmath4 .",
    "if interpreted as pure luminosity evolution , this brightening implies a factor of @xmath5 increase is star - formation rate between @xmath3 and @xmath0 ( bamford et al .",
    "2006 ; nakamura et al .  2006 ) . however , the sample selection and the exact details of how the comparison is made between samples at different redshifts have very severe effects on the measured evolution ( cf .",
    "vogt 2006 , this symposium ) .",
    "bhm et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found a correlation between the optical tfr residuals and the rotation velocity @xmath6 and argued that the observed luminosity evolution is mass dependent , in the sense that low - mass galaxies seem to exhibit a much stronger rate of evolution than massive ones ( but see weiner et al .",
    "2006 for an opposite view ) .",
    "however , bamford et al .  ( 2006 ) demonstrated that such a correlation may exist purely due to an intrinsic coupling between the @xmath6 scatter and the tfr residuals , acting in combination with the selection effects inherent to magnitude - limited samples .",
    "thus , decoupling real evolution from observational artifacts if far from trivial .",
    "studies at longer wavelengths ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2005 ) find very little or no evolution in the near - infrared ( or stellar mass ) tfr of field spirals up to @xmath0 , suggesting that baryonic mass is accreted by disks along with dark matter at @xmath7 .",
    "kannappan et al .  ( 2002 ) found that the deviations from the tfr of nearby galaxies are strongly correlated with their colours and h@xmath8 equivalent widths , and thus with their star formation properties and history .",
    "correlations with the degree of photometric and kinematic asymmetry were also found , presumably linked with the dynamical interactions and history of the galaxies .",
    "since these effects are environmentally - dependent , it is clear that the tfr and its evolution can be strongly influenced by the environment .",
    "vogt at al .",
    "( 2004a , b , c ) carried out a detailed study of the effect of the cluster environment on the rotation curves and tfr of low redshift galaxies .",
    "one of their results is that cluster and field star - forming spirals follow essentially the same tfr , while non - starforming galaxies seem to be too faint for their rotation velocity .",
    "these spirals could be on their way to becoming s0s ( see  4 ) .",
    "comparisons of the tfrs of cluster and field spirals at redshifts reaching @xmath0 have been published by milvang - jensen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , ziegler et al.(2003 ) , bamford et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , nakamura et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and metevier et al.(2006 ) .",
    "although most of these studies do not find significant differences between the tfrs of field and cluster spirals , milvang - jensen et al .  and",
    "bamford at al .  reported some evidence suggesting that cluster star - forming spirals are brighter , at a fixed @xmath6 , than their field counterparts at the same redshift .",
    "their interpretation is that field spirals falling into rich clusters undergo a ( short ? ) period of enhanced star formation before having their star formation quenched by the cluster environment and transforming , perhaps , into s0s .",
    "nakamura et al .  ( 2006 ) showed that even if such processes are taking place , their effect on the tfr of star - forming cluster galaxies could be quite difficult to detect .",
    "they also demonstrated that the sample selection and the details of how the analysis is actually carried out could have a very strong effect on the conclusions of cluster - field comparisons .",
    "in recent years several groups have extended the study of the tfr to s0 galaxies ( see bedregal et al .  2006a , b and references therein ) .",
    "despite the considerable technical challenges involved in determining the true @xmath9 from absorption line spectra of galaxies with significant non - rotational support ( see mathieu et al .",
    "2002 ) , it seems clear now that s0s are , at a given rotation velocity , fainter than spiral galaxies in the optical and near - infrared .",
    "the measured offset between the so and spiral tfrs seems now to be consistent with the hypothesis that s0s where once spirals that ceased forming stars .",
    "indeed , the amount of fading implied by the offset from the spiral tfr of individual s0 galaxies seems to correlate with how long ago their star formation ceased ( see figure  [ fig : fig1 ] and bedregal et al .",
    "interestingly , a similar conclusion is reached from the properties of the globular cluster systems of s0s and spirals ( aragn - salamanca et al .",
