    "optical lattice system has gradually become a promising platform to simulate and study a lot of quantum phenomena in condensed matter physics because almost all parameters of the system can be well - controlled@xcite .",
    "the recent theoretical and experimental progress in laser - induced - gauge - field @xcite makes it a hot spot to study topological quantum states @xcite in cold atoms system@xcite .",
    "subject to the compounds natural properties @xcite , the famous haldane model @xcite proposed two decades ago has not been confirmed by experiments because the required periodic magnetic field can not be easily implemented in actual material . for topological insulator , an important extension from the haldane model to a time - reversal invariant system @xcite ,",
    "only a few materials are confirmed currently to have such exotic topological properties in the nature @xcite , because the existence of such properties require relatively strong spin - orbit ( so ) coupling .",

    ", the neutral - cold - atom integer and fractional quantum hall effects have been studied @xcite and also the realization of haldane model has been designed by using the laser - induced - gauge - field method in optical lattice @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a scheme to simulate and detect the 2-dimensional ( 2d ) quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulator in a kagom optical lattice with a trimer and a nearest - neighbor so coupling term . with laser - induced - gauge - field method , one can design a variety of lattice so couplings @xcite , which is convenient for us to study the 2d topological insulator in the optical lattice @xcite .",
    "however , the original proposal @xcite of realizing 2d qsh insulator in honeycomb lattice requires the next - nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude .",
    "this requirement causes doing experiments in the optical lattice difficult because high barrier makes the next - nearest - neighbor tunneling very small .",

    "we find that a kagom optical lattice with the trimer and so coupling terms can host the 2d qsh insulator phase with only the nearest - neighbor hopping . since the model only involves the nearest - neighbor hopping , it would be easier to be implemented in cold atomic experiments .",
    "furthermore , compared to the condensed matter systems , we find that detecting qsh insulator has more advantage in optical lattice system . due to the time - reversal symmetry",

    "it is essential that the spatial density profile is uniquely determined by the function @xmath262 in the local density approximation ,  which is typically well satisfied for trapped fermions .",
    "we focus in the point @xmath102=@xmath5 where the dirac mass makes its central effect on the density or chern number .",
    "when the system is in qsh phase , as an example , we take the parameters @xmath263 , specially assuming @xmath264=@xmath265=@xmath266=@xmath267=@xmath268 , then we have @xmath269 .",
    "the spin - atomic density is shown in fig",
    ". 6(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the up - spin - atomic density @xmath249=@xmath270 ( fig .",
    "6(a ) ) and the down - one @xmath250=@xmath271 ( fig .",
    "6(b ) ) . for the normal phase ,",
    "we take @xmath272 and assume @xmath273=@xmath274=@xmath275=@xmath276=@xmath268 , which means @xmath277 .",
    "we obtain @xmath278=@xmath5 ( fig .",
    "6(c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "the spin - atomic density shows the similar relation comparing to the conclusion of spin chern number theroy .",
    "this is not surprising because according to the streda formula and from eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) , it is easy to obtain the relation between the spin chern number and the spin - atomic density as@xmath279 this formula provides us the approach to measure whether the system is in the qsh phase .",
    "firstly ,  we measured the spin - atomic density and denoted it as @xmath280 at @xmath102=@xmath5 in the absence of @xmath243 .",
    "then the optical lattice is rotated to generate the effective uniform magnetic field @xmath243 , and the new density of the cold atoms @xmath281 is measured again . if @xmath282 and @xmath283 ,  the system is in qsh insulator phase . however , if @xmath284=@xmath280 , the system is in the normal insulator phase .",
    "since the density difference is actually quantized in units @xmath260 ,  the above method could be rather robust .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ spin - chern ] ) that the total chern number @xmath4=@xmath0+@xmath2=@xmath5 and thus the direct detection of the qsh phase is a challenge in an electronic system .",
    "however the qsh phase can be directly verified in the atomic systems since the densities @xmath249 and @xmath250 can be separately detected @xcite . to experimentally detect the spin - atomic density , we need first transfer the dressed state @xmath285 to a different hyperfine level @xmath286 which is coupled to the excited state @xmath155 by a laser pulse ( with a rabi frequency @xmath191 ) , as seen in fig",
    "this pulse , together with the original laser beams @xmath171 and @xmath158 , make a raman transition with an effective hamiltonian @xmath287=@xmath288+h.c .",
    "( note that the state @xmath289 is still decoupled because of the phase relation between @xmath171 and @xmath158 ) @xcite .",
    "although the form of the state @xmath290 is spatially varying , the rabi frequency @xmath291 ( and thus also @xmath292 ) is spatially constant .",
    "a complete raman transition with a @xmath133 pulse will transfer all of the atoms being in the dressed state @xmath285 to hyperfine state @xmath286 . after this operation ,",
    "the initial different dressed spin states are mapped to different hyperfine levels , and the populations in different atomic hyperfine levels can be separately imaged with the known experimental techniques .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a model which promises to host the transition from the qsh insulator phase to the normal insulator phase in the 2d kagom optical lattice .",
    "the model includes two kind of periodic perturbations , i.e. , a nearest - neighbor intrinsic so coupling and a trimerized hamiltonian .",
    "the competition between them determines the system s phase .",
    "then we demonstrate that the lattice so coupling can be simulated by the laser - induced - gauge - field method and give the specific laser setting and parameters to realize the intrinsic so coupling .",
    "furthermore , we have established the relation between spin chern number and spin - atomic density and then we can detect the spin chern number through the standard density - profile technique used in atomic system .",
