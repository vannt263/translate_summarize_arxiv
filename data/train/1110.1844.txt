    "the metal insulator transition ( mit ) observed in most of the vanadium oxides compounds belonging to the so - called magnli phase has attracted a lot of interest @xcite . among these compounds",
    "vo@xmath2 is probably the most investigated @xcite . on decreasing the temperature below 340 k",
    ", it shows an abrupt mit , characterized by a huge jump in the conductivity and a simultaneous structural transition from rutile ( @xmath9 ) metallic phase to monoclinic ( @xmath3 ) insulating phase @xcite . in the @xmath9 phase , the v - atoms , each surrounded by an oxygen octahedron , are equally spaced in linear chains along the @xmath7-axis and form a body - centered tetragonal lattice @xcite .",
    "the transition from the high - symmetry @xmath9 phase to the low symmetry @xmath3 phase results mainly in a rearrangement in the v - chains .",
    "structural data show indeed the dimerization of the v - atoms in the chain and the tilting of the v - v pairs with respect to the @xmath7 axis @xcite .",
    "the mit in vo@xmath2 has been a subject of intense study to pin - point the key players driving the transition @xcite .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed , an electron correlation - driven mott transition @xcite , a structure - driven peierls transition @xcite or a cooperation of these two mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the understanding of vo@xmath2 physics is even more complicated due to the presence of two additional insulating monoclinic phases of this material , which appear on applying uniaxial stress @xcite or on doping with small amounts of acceptor ( w or nb ) @xcite or donor ( cr ) @xcite impurities . in particular , on doping vo@xmath2 with small amounts of cr , @xmath10 and m@xmath11 monoclinic phases ( space group @xmath12 ) appear .",
    "these are characterized by different arrangement of the v chains @xcite . in the @xmath10 structure",
    "the v pairing is partially removed , _",
    "i.e. _ one half of the v atoms dimerizes , and the other one forms zig - zag chains of equally spaced atoms .",
    "the @xmath13 phase is an intermediate one in which the v - v pairs of the @xmath10 phase tilt and the zig - zag chains start to pair .",
    "we have recently investigated the effects induced by the application of high pressure ( hp ) on vo@xmath2 based systems using raman and infrared spectroscopy @xcite . differently from the ambient pressure case , where the metallic phase is found only in conjunction with the r structure ,",
    "evidences of a new room temperature metallic monoclinic phase have been found above 10 gpa @xcite .",
    "these findings opened to new experimental / theoretical queries about the hp structural arrangement of the v atoms and its role in driving the mit in the vo@xmath2-systems .",
    "a hp structural study of pure and cr - doped vo@xmath2 is of interest for a deeper understanding of the high pressure delocalization dynamics and for a description of the peierls - type distortion evolution .",
    "here we report on a hp ( 0 - 20 gpa ) synchrotron x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) study carried out on v@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 , where @xmath14=0.0% , @xmath15% and 2.5 % under ambient pressure and temperature are respectively in monoclinic @xmath3 , @xmath13 , and @xmath10 phases .",
    "regardless of the cr content , all the investigated systems are found to be in monoclinic m@xmath16 phase between 4 and 12 gpa .",
    "above 12 gpa the monoclinic @xmath3 phase transforms into an isostructural monoclinic @xmath4 phase ( space group @xmath5 ) .",
    "in addition , our results reveal a significant anisotropy in lattice compression in the high pressure regime .",
    "this behavior can be reconciled invoking the pressure induced charge - delocalization .",

    "preliminary phase purity checks were carried out on several of these obtained micron sized single - crystals through x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) . once the phase purity is assured , the single crystal pieces were crushed in a mortar to obtain the required powdered samples .",
    "these powdered samples were analysed using differential scanning calorimetery ( dsc ) and powder xrd .",

    "[ fig1bis](a ) , it can be clearly observed how the bragg peaks shift towards high angles owing to lattice compression without any modification of the overall peak pattern up to p@xmath23 .",
    "pressure induced structural transitions in the low pressure regime ( p@xmath24 4 gpa ) are instead observed for the two cr - doped samples [ figs .",
    "[ fig1bis ] ( b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "data refinement of the diffraction patterns clearly shows the transition of the two doped samples towards the @xmath3 phase , characteristic of the pure compound , on increasing the pressure : the @xmath25 transition of the 0.7% cr doped sample occurs at 2.7 gpa whereas , the @xmath26 transition of the 2.5% doped at 3.7 gpa [ blue in figs .",
    "[ fig1bis ] ( b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "the evolution of the crystal - structures can be followed looking at the three bragg peaks at around 7.3 , characteristic of the @xmath10 and @xmath13 phases which transform into the doublet of the @xmath3 phase ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1bis ] and [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "similarly , the sequence of peaks located at 11.0@xmath27 and 14.5@xmath27 which merge into single peaks for p@xmath18 4 gpa .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this finding is consistent with the observed pressure dependence of the raman - active phonons reported in ref .",

    "[ fig1 ] at p = 0.3 gpa are apparently broader than those of other samples .",
    "this is quite clear looking at fig .",
    "[ raman ] ( a ) where the peak around 8.90   is shown for the pure and @xmath30 doped samples at p=0.3 gpa .",
    "this broadening is due to the phase coexistence at low pressure - regime between the @xmath13 and @xmath3 phases in the 0.7% sample .",
    "in fact xrd refinements show the bragg peak around 8.90   has contribution from both ( 310 ) of @xmath13 and ( -102 ) of @xmath3 phases .",

    "[ fig3bis ] .",
    "the quality of data allows indeed for a good estimate of the lattice parameters , whereas it is not sufficient to follow the precise evolution of the atomic positions in the high pressure regime . for the sake of completeness , the obtained parameters ( e.g.",
    ", lattice constants and atomic positions ) from the xrd rietveld refinement analysis are given as tables in the supplementary information file .",
    "it is worth to notice that when changing from the @xmath10 or the @xmath13 conventional cell to the @xmath3 cell , the geometrical meaning of cell axes changes according to a non - trivial relation ( see ref . ) . at low pressure ( p@xmath24 4 gpa )",
    "the cr - doped samples exhibit a rather scattered behavior ( mainly the @xmath14 = 0.7% sample ) of all the lattice constants , which highlights an embedded instability of low symmetry structures m@xmath2 and m@xmath11 that evolve towards @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath3 ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath12 ) structures show different arrangements of the unit cells , with respectively 12 and 24 atoms ( doubling of the @xmath3 unit cell with respect to @xmath10(@xmath13 ) @xcite ) per unit - cell . as mentioned above , on changing the space group the geometrical meaning of the lattice parameters",

    "let us now focus on the high pressure regime , p @xmath33 . in this case we basically do not consider differences among the three samples anymore .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] it is evident that although the @xmath34 axis exhibits a regular continuous decrease with pressure , a strong anisotropic compression of the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane ( of the @xmath3 phase ) occurs . as a matter of fact ,",

    "the present results demonstrate that the high pressure metallic phase is apparently a structural phase common to all the compounds studied regardless the different ambient pressure structural symmetries .",
    "the fact that the metallic @xmath4 phase has the same symmetry of the insulating @xmath3 phase implies that the former preserves the v dimers up to the maximum pressure .",
    "the only relevant difference of the metallic @xmath4 phase from the insulating @xmath3 is the remarkably different response of the lattice upon volume compression ( figs . [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "in addition , bearing in mind that the extent of peierls distortion is increasing on going from the @xmath10 to the @xmath13 to the @xmath3 phase indicate that the lattice compression in these systems , surprisingly appears to enforce the peierls distortion .",
    "this peculiar behavior can represent a benchmark for any future theoretical work aimed at addressing the physics of these highly correlated systems .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated structural evolution as a function of pressure of v@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 ( pure , 0.7% and 2.5% cr doped ) compounds . as pressure is raised",

    "the three systems remain in a @xmath3 symmetry , with a monotonic decrease of the unit - cell parameters until a threshold pressure , p@xmath42 gpa . above p@xmath23 ,",
    "all the samples show a remarkable anisotropic compression without any change in crystal symmetry , which remains as m@xmath16 . in this high pressure regime ( p@xmath18p@xmath23 )",
    ", the @xmath6 axis becomes more compressible while the @xmath7 axis hardens indicating a non - trivial rearrangement of charge densities occurring over the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane .",
    "the onset of the anisotropic compression occurs at a pressure quite close to the metallization boundary identified in the high pressure infra - red spectra @xcite .",
    "this behavior can be thus regarded as a structural signature of the metallization transition occurring in vo@xmath2 and in the cr - doped compounds .    at ambient pressure",
    ", the activation of the peierls distortion along the v - v chains is regarded as the major microscopic mechanism for the onset of the low temperature insulating phase , although experimental evidences suggest also the relevance of strong electronic correlations .",
    "on applying the pressure , our present findings together with the optical data reported in refs .",
    "[ ] , reveal the simultaneous coexistence of a peierls distorted monoclinic phase together with an enhancement of the metallicity of the system .",
    "the electronic modifications in the high pressure regime ( p@xmath18p@xmath23 ) occur without a clear , simultaneous symmetrization of the v - v chains and regardless the different extent of the cr - induced distortion .",
    "present results thus demonstrate the possibility of a mit mainly driven by electron - electron correlation and these results represent a severe bench mark for any theoretical modeling aimed at describing the electronic and structural modifications of vo@xmath2 induced by temperature and lattice compression .",
