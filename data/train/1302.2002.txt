    "population i wolf  rayet ( wr ) stars lose mass at prodigious rates ( @xmath1m@xmath2yr@xmath3 ) in dense , fast stellar winds giving the stars their characteristic emission - line spectra : they represent the last stable stage in the evolution of massive stars . their high luminosities and conspicuous spectra facilitate identification in external galaxies , while the stellar winds have a profound influence on the local interstellar medium , enriching it with nuclear - processed material and frequently forming bubbles .",
    "when wr stars are members of binary systems with other luminous stars possessing stellar winds , the collision of the two stellar winds can result in shock - heating of stellar wind material and particle acceleration , observable in x - ray and non - thermal radio emission .",
    "some colliding - wind binaries ( cwbs ) incorporating wc type wr stars also form carbon dust in their winds , observable by its conspicuous infrared ( ir ) emission .",
    "these phenomena often vary periodically , especially if the stars move in an elliptic orbit and their separation varies so that the wind - collision region ( wcr ) moves periodically between denser or rarer regions of the stellar winds .",
    "also , depending on the inclination of the system , our line of sight to the wcr passes through varying amounts of stellar wind as the orbit progresses , causing variations in the free - free and photoionization extinction to the observed radio and x - ray emission .",
    "the prototype is wr140 (= hd  193793 ) , whose ir , radio and x - ray variations were linked to the motion of its wc7 and o5 components in their 7.94-yr orbit by williams et al .",
    "this system has continued to attract observations in all wavelength domains  for a recent summary , see williams ( 2011a )  as a laboratory of particle acceleration ( e.g. pittard & dougherty 2006 ) and led to the identification of other variable dust - making wr cwbs in the galaxy .",
    "the observation of rotating dust ` pinwheels ' around some of the wr systems which show persistent dust emission ( e.g. wr104 , by tuthill et al .",
    "2008 ) associates these with cwbs too .",
    "the persistent dust makers are nearly all wc9 stars and their locations show a strong preference for the metal - rich region of our galaxy , generally towards the galactic centre . on the other hand , the variable and episodic wr dust makers have spectral types ranging from wc5 to wc8 and a less concentrated galactic distribution  but all of them are located within the solar circle .",
    "this suggests a strong influence of environmental metallicity on the phenomenon of dust formation by wr systems .    in the lower metallicity environments of the magellanic clouds , the fractions of wr / o stars and distributions of wr spectral subtypes are very different from those in our galaxy .",
    "in particular , of the 24 wc / wo stars in the lmc , 23 are of type wc4 and one a wo3 ( moffat 2008 ) . the question arises : do any of these make carbon dust",
    "? this can be tackled by a survey of their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) or a search for variability in the ir characteristic of the variable or episodic dust - makers like wr140 . to begin , we examined the @xmath4-band photometry of the lmc wc4 stars measured in the deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ; epchtein et al . 1999 , cioni et al .",
    "2002 ) , two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) including the 6x w / lmc / smc point source working database , and infrared survey facility ( irsf ) magellanic cloud ( kato et al .",
    "2007 ) surveys for evidence of variability . of the 21 lmc wc4 stars with at least three observations ,",
    "the best candidate for variability , after discounting stars with uncertain data or lying in very crowded regions where close companions could be included in the apertures of some but not other surveys , was hd  36402 (= bat9938 , breysacher , azzopardi & testor 1999 )",
    ". it would certainly be worth repeating the search for variability when the vista magellanic clouds survey ( cioni et al .",
    "2011 ) , with its higher resolution and homogeneity , is complete .",
    "the case for hd  36402 being a wr dust maker was strengthened by its mid - ir ( 3.68 @xmath5 m ) photometry in the _ spitzer _ sage lmc survey ( bonanos et al .",
    "2009 ) , where it was identified as the reddest wr star .",
    "a preliminary account of the present study was presented at the 2010 liac ( williams 2011b , paper  i ) , where it was shown that the 28 @xmath5 m sed was characteristic of of wr dust , but that at wavelengths beyond 10  @xmath5 m , the emission from the wr star could not easily be resolved from that by two nearby luminous young stellar objects ( ysos ) discovered by chu et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and that the 70- and 160-@xmath5 m fluxes tentatively ascribed to a ring nebula associated with hd 36402 by bonanos et al . came entirely from the ysos .    independently , boyer et al .",
    "( 2010 ) came to a similar conclusion in their study of the far - ir emission from three dust - making evolved stars in the lmc with _",
    "herschel _ instrumentation .",
    "they presented the seds of hd  36402 and of a strong far - ir source , hd  36402  ir1 immediately to the west of the wr star , having @xmath6 64 and 8  k. they considered the possibility that ir1 could be heated by the stellar flux from hd  36402 but concluded that it was more likely to be the ysos embedded in a molecular cloud .",
    "the field is certainly crowded at longer wavelengths , making interpretation of long - wavelength observations with smaller instruments ( e.g. _ iras _ or _ msx _ ) with their larger beam sizes difficult , but there is no confusion in the irac bands  even at 8 @xmath5 m , hd  36402 is 1.7 mag .",
    "brighter than the closer yso ( yso-2 , 7  arcsec to the w of the wr star ) . at this wavelength , the irac beam ( fazio et al . 2004 ) is smaller than 2 arcsec full width half maximum ( fwhm ) , so we consider yso-2 to be well separated from hd 36402 in all irac bands as the magnitude differences are greater at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the field near hd  36402 at 3.6  @xmath5 m is shown in fig.[fchart ] .",
    "the spectrum and orbit of hd  36402 were studied by moffat , niemela & marraco ( 1990 ) , who derived an orbit from the wr emission lines having a period of 3.03269  d and radial velocity ( rv ) amplitude @xmath7  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the absorption - line rv amplitude was not significantly different from zero ( @xmath8  km  s@xmath3 ) , suggesting that the o8 supergaint did not participate in the 3-d orbit and that hd  36402 was a triple system like @xmath9  mus (= wr48 ) or r  130 in the lmc .",
    "from five high - resolution _ iue _ spectra , konigsberger , moffat & auer ( 2003 ) measured rvs of photospheric absorption lines which fitted a sinusoidal variation in anti - phase with the emission - line spectrum , suggesting formation in the close companion to the wc star , but more probably produced by the superposition of the stationary absorption lines from the o8 supergiant and rotationally broadened absorption lines produced in the close companion . in their study of hd  193793 ( wr140 ) , fitzpatrick , savage & sitko ( 1982 ) compared its _ iue _ spectrum with that of hd  36402 . the @xmath101550 civ profile in hd  36402",
    "showed narrow interstellar lines from both the milky way and the lmc and two sets of circumstellar absorption lines .",
    "the broader set was shifted @xmath11  km  s@xmath3 relative to the lmc interstellar lines and the narrower pair by @xmath12  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the same features , at the same velocities and strengths , were seen in another _ iue _ spectrum taken three months earlier , ruling out their formation in a transient event .",
    "niedzielski & skrzyski ( 2002 ) used the _ iue _ high - resolution spectra to determine a terminal velocity of @xmath13 km  s@xmath3 , comparable to those of other wc4 stars in the lmc and our galaxy .",
    "it seems reasonable to attribute the @xmath12 km  s@xmath3 absorption to the o8i component ; it is in line with the range of terminal velocities ( 9552186 km  s@xmath3 ) measured for o8 supergaints by prinja , barlow & howarth ( 1990 ) .    in this paper , we present new observations of hd  36402 from images taken for the n51d study by chu et al .",
    "and post - cryo observations extracted from the _ spitzer _ heritage archive .",
    "recently , additional mid - ir observations have become available from the _ akari _ lmc ( kato et al .",
    "2012 ) and _ wise _ ( wright et al . 2010 ) surveys .",
    "we use these data to re - examine the ir variability of hd 36402 and derive a period , and consider its status as a dust - making wr cwb .",
    ".near - infrared photometry of hd 36402 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ txray ]    bomans et al .",
    "( 2002 ) drew attention to the high x - ray luminosity ( @xmath14 erg  s@xmath3 of hd 36402 measured with _",
    "xmm - newton _ , but noted also the softness of the spectral index ( @xmath15 ) , which argued against its being caused soley by collision of the stellar winds .",
    "x - ray emission by hd  36402 was also observed using the _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) and high resolution imager ( hri ) with 0.57.0  kev luminosities of @xmath16 erg  s@xmath3 and @xmath17 erg  s@xmath3 respectively ( guerrero & chu 2008 ) .",
    "the individual _ rosat _ observations were recovered and are given in table [ txray ] . to facilitate comparison ,",
    "luminosities were derived from the _ rosat _ count rates using web  pimms and adopting the absorption column @xmath18  @xmath19 and @xmath20  kev derived from the _ xmm - newton _ spectral fit , i.e. folding all the variability into the ` absorbed luminosities ' @xmath21 .",
    "it is apparent that the x - ray flux observed from hd 36402 is variable .",
    "most striking are the non - detections in the 1992 _ rosat _ pscp observations in 1992.19 although the integration times were longer than those before and afterwards , in which hd 36402 was detected .",
    "the 1992.19 observations occurred close to zero ir phase , and perhaps @xmath22 after periastron passage in the 4.7-yr binary believed to be responsible for the variable dust formation .",
    "the non - detection of x - ray emission from hd 36402 followed by its quick recovery invites comparison with the narrow minimum in the x - ray light curves of wr140 , which occurs just after periastron passage ( e.g. pollock et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the x - ray flux observed from a cwb depends on both the intrinscic emission measure and the photoionization extinction through the stellar winds , especially the heavier wind of the wc star .",
    "the source is expected to lie close to the stagnation point between the wc4+o ? and o8i winds and ,",
    "as seen above , much closer to the o8i star .",
    "the circumstellar extinction varies as the orbit progresses and the source moves through the wc4 wind according to the orbital elements  expressions are given by williams et al .",
    "( 1990 )  and is usually greatest near periastron , when the source is most deeply buried in the wr stellar wind , or conjunction , when the source passes behind the wr star .",
    "the non - detection of x - ray emission from hd 36402 at phase 0.99 and relative weakness at phase 0.81 are consistent with this picture but modelling the x - ray variations requires knowlege of the ` outer ' orbit .",
    "the intrinsic emission measure is also expected to vary round the orbit , as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the separation of the stars , for an adiabatic wcr ( stevens , blondin & pollock 1992 ) .",
    "this would make the intrinsic emission measure somewhat greater at periastron , but without more spectroscopy or at least measures of the hardness ratio around the orbit , we can not tell at this stage .    the relatively wide separation of the outer binary implied by its period should allow non - thermal radio emission from the wcr to emerge ( cf .",
    "dougherty & williams 2000 ) , at least away from periastron , but the distance of the lmc would make this a challenging observation with current instrumentation ",
    "e.g. the maximum 6-cm flux density of wr140 shifted to the distance of the lmc would be @xmath25 30  @xmath5jy .",
    "the demonstration that one of the wr systems in the lmc is an episodic dust - maker like those in the galaxy suggests that there are more to be found .",
    "other candidate dust - variables include hd  32125 ( bat999 ) and hd  38448 ( bat99125 ) . in the case of hd  32125 ,",
    "most of dispersion in @xmath4 comes from the denis observation , which has a relatively large uncertainty ( @xmath26 0.22 mag ) , so it would be premature to consider it a episodic dust - maker and both stars need re - examination for variability when photometry from the vmc survey becomes available . if episodic dust formation is possible in the low metallicity environment of the lmc , what about persistent dust formation , like that observed from some wc89 stars observed in the inner regions of the galaxy ?",
    "one candidate amongst the lmc wr systems is bat99121 , which has anomalously red @xmath27@xmath4 colours in both the 2mass and irsf mc surveys .",
    "this star is in a difficult field and will be discussed elsewhere . in any event ,",
    "hd  36402 has posed the question : why has dust formation not been observed from galactic wr systems outside the solar circle , where the overall metallicity is lower ?",
    "a second question is what is the lowest metallicity environment in which wr systems can make and contribute dust to the ism ?",
