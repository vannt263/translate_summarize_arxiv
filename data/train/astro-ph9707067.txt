    "the absolute and relative ages of globular clusters in the galaxy and in the nearest local group galaxies provide unique constraints on cosmology and early epochs of galaxy formation .",
    "however , the ages of globular clusters can not be determined , even in a differential sense , without knowledge to high precision of their chemical composition ( or metallicity ) .",
    "an error of 0.3  dex in the overall heavy element abundance of a cluster  usually denoted by [ fe / h ]  corresponds to an error of about 3  gyr in the age derived from fitting an otherwise absolutely correct isochrone to main - sequence photometry of perfect accuracy . even for some bright , nearby clusters ,",
    "recent careful abundance measurements differ by more than this amount , which reflects the challenges of detailed analyses from stellar spectra . without reliable metallicity determinations for many clusters , and especially for the crucial clusters near the galactic center",
    ", we can not hope to test models of milky way formation in a compelling fashion .    in 1989",
    "we carried out a photometric and spectroscopic program at las campanas observatory that was aimed at developing a highly precise relative ranking of globular cluster abundances from measurements of the  triplet lines in the near infrared spectra of 12 - 15 probable red giant members of each of 52 clusters .",
    "the early work of armandroff and zinn ( 1988 , hereafter az88 ) used the  triplet lines formed in the integrated light of galactic globular clusters , from which it appeared that an internal precision of 0.15  dex per star was possible provided chromospherically active stars were avoided .",
    "moreover , by working in the infrared , sensitivity would be reduced to the high and variable reddening towards many clusters of great interest for the evaluation of formation scenarios for the galaxy . at the time the project began , it was a relatively unexplored empirical approach which had been applied primarily to integrated or composite light , and our goal was to acquire data of such quality on individual giants that we could assess thoroughly and independently the optimum procedures and relative merits of this technique .",
    "since we undertook this project , several others have exploited with great effect the  triplet technique applied to individual giants for estimating abundances of globular clusters , with particular emphasis upon distant and/or sparse objects ( see , e.g. , armandroff and da costa 1991 [ hereafter ad91 ] , olszewski et al .",

    "while these programs have provided numerous results of widespread interest , the original motivation of our program remains . in this paper",
    "we describe how we optimized our reduction of the spectral data (  [ excal ] ) to provide radial velocities (  [ radvel ] ) and equivalent widths (  [ ew ] ) , compare our prescriptions and results with those of other workers (  [ transform ] ) , and present a catalog of the individual stellar results (  [ catalog ] ) . following the ad91 prescription ,",

    "a companion paper discusses the calibration of our cluster  values to  values , and the astrophysical implications of our results .",
    "spectra were obtained at the las campanas observatory s 2.5 m dupont telescope equipped with the modular spectrograph and the canon 85 mm f/1.2 camera .",
    "a gg495 filter was used to block the second and higher spectral orders .",
    "the ti#2 detector ( 800 @xmath1 800 thinned ccd ; readout noise = 11  @xmath2  pix@xmath3 ; gain = 1.35  @xmath2 per adu ; scale = 0.85  @xmath4  pix@xmath3 ) was used with an 831  l  mm@xmath3 ( 8000    blaze ) grating , which produced a dispersion of 2.19    pix@xmath3 and spectral coverage from 72509000   .",
    "the @xmath5 slit provided an instrumental spectral resolution of @xmath04   .",
    "observations were obtained on two 1989 runs : 1 ) april 1320 and 2 ) july 1321 . of the 52 clusters observed , 23 were observed during the first run only , 26 were observed during the second run only , and three were observed during both runs to check the consistency of our results . in each cluster",
    ", spectra were obtained for 10 to 20 stars selected from published color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) to lie on the red giant branch ( rgb ) and , if proper motion data were available , to be likely proper - motion members .",
    "probable asymptotic branch ( agb ) stars were avoided , as were horizontal branch ( hb ) stars , and known variable stars near the rgb tip .",
    "slit positions were chosen to contain at least two stars per spectrograph rotation .    each star was observed two or three times consecutively , with an fe - ar arc taken before and after each sequence for the wavelength calibration . occasionally the same star was observed on different nights , or with a different slit orientation , to check for systematic effects in our results .",
    "exposure times for a single frame ranged from 2 min to 17 min .",
    "the adopted data for the clusters we observed are presented in table  [ clusters ] , where the columns are , respectively : 1 ) the running cluster identification number used in figure  [ veldiff.grp ] ; 2,3,4 ) the ngc , other cluster , and iau names ; 5,6 ) galactic longitude and latitude in degrees ; 7 ) the visual magnitude of the horizontal branch level , ; 8,9 ) the radial velocity and associated uncertainty , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; 10 ) the mean reddening for the cluster ; 11 ) the central velocity dispersion from pryor and meylan ( 1993 , hereafter pm93 ) ; 12,13 ) the metallicity and associated uncertainty of the cluster taken from zinn and west ( 1984 , hereafter zw84 ) ; 14 ) the standard deviation adopted for the  photometry , which is used in  [ reduced_ew ] during the robust line fitting technique to determine the reduced equivalent width , , of the cluster ( this value is estimated from the scatter in the cmds published by the authors from which we adopted the photometry [ see appendix [ notes ] ] , and represents a combination of both the photometric errors and differential reddening within the cluster ) . the data from columns 5 - 10 were taken from a 1994 version of the harris ( 1996 ) electronic mwgc catalog ( hereafter referred to as the mwgc catalog ) , and references can be found in appendix [ notes ] .",
    "since there was not an overscan region on our detector , the bias level of each frame was estimated from the mean level of the bias frames .",
    "this was a satisfactory approach for run one , where the bias level remained constant at @xmath0550  adu .",
    "however , due to a ccd electronics problem , the bias level in run two varied between 540 and 650  adu on timescales of a few hours .",
    "the illumination response along the slit resulted in a @xmath021% reduction in transmission from one end of the slit to the other .",
    "this effect was independent of slit rotation , and was found in both the object and flat field frames . by normalizing the flat field frames along the dispersion axis only ( with the iraf task * response ) , we could use them to remove the illumination response . for run two , where the bias level of each frame was uncertain ,",
    "the illumination response may not have been removed correctly by this procedure . for these data we chose sky windows on both sides of , and immediately adjacent to ,",
    "the stellar spectrum being extracted so that a low - order fit between the windows would account satisfactorily for any residual errors in the illumination response and bias level .",
    "spectra in crowded fields were not extracted from run two data when windows appropriate for accurate sky subtraction could not be identified adjacent to a spectrum .",
    "*    we removed cosmic rays were removed with the iraf task * cosmicrays , while any remaining cosmic rays seen in a visual inspection of the two - dimensional images we removed using iraf s * imedit .",
    "we rectified residual distortion in the images ( manifested by curved night sky lines near the edges of the frames ) with the iraf tasks * fitcoords and * transform . * * * *    several bad columns and pixels were noted before the observations were taken , and stars were placed on the slit to avoid them .",
    "several other unreliable sections of the ccd were mapped and avoided during spectral extractions .",
    "charge skimmed columns , in which the percentage of electrons skimmed varied with time , were also discovered during the reductions ; no stars were extracted which fell on these columns .",
    "spectral extractions were made with iraf s * apextract tasks .",
    "two sky windows , with a minimum of 15 pixels each , were chosen on either side of the star , and a linear fit between the median values in the two windows was used to define the sky level at the position of the stellar spectrum .",
    "the windows were chosen to be as close to the star as possible , while still adhering to the run two constraints mentioned earlier . to facilitate the placement of the sky windows , a maximum of one bad column or charge skimmed column",
    "was permitted to lie in a window and be dealt with by the medianing process .",
    "the arc spectra were extracted with the identical parameters used for the stellar extractions .",
    "the two arc exposures associated with a given star were averaged and the resultant digital spectra were logically connected to the appropriate extracted stellar spectrum . *    we calculated the dispersion solution for each spectrum with a fortran program ( similar to iraf s world coordinate system , which was unavailable at the time of the reductions ) that did not alter the pixel binning or the pixel values , but rather wrote the coefficients of the dispersion solution to the headers of the individual spectra . for each arc ,",
    "the program found every line above a threshold value and separated from all other lines by at least two pixels , and fit each with a moffat function of exponent four to establish an accurate pixel center .",
    "a legendre polynomial with five terms was fit to give the wavelength dispersion solution .",
    "this was done consecutively for all the spectra of a given run , and the mean and @xmath8 of the residual ( @xmath9 ) for each line was calculated .",
    "if the mean residual was greater than 0.5   , then the line was not used for the final dispersion solution .",
    "the remainder of the lines were weighted such that @xmath10 we applied these new weights in the final dispersion solution calculation for each spectrum . in the end ,",
    "16 lines in the wavelength interval 7272  - 8668     were used .    to estimate the  of each spectrum",
    ", we used two wavelength windows : 85808620    and 87008800   .",
    "these windows were chosen such that none of the globular cluster  triplet lines would be velocity shifted into them . in each of these regions",
    "a robust line fitting technique was used to fit a straight line to the pixel values , where the absolute deviation was minimized in the fit rather than the square of the deviation .",
    "let @xmath11 be the pixel value divided by its fitted value , and let the mean and average deviation of all @xmath11 in a window be denoted as @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( after clipping by 3 @xmath1 @xmath13 ) .",
    "the  for each window was then estimated to be @xmath12/@xmath13 , and the  for the spectrum in the relevant  triplet region was taken to be the average  calculated for the two windows .",
    "figure  [ soncomp.grp ] shows a plot of the  triplet region for four of our program spectra having  values ranging from 12 to 125 .",
    "the distribution of  values for all of our program spectra can be found in figure  [ sondist.grp ] .",
    "the @xmath01% of the spectra with  @xmath14 15 were not analyzed further .",
    "radial velocities aid in identifying _ bona fide _ cluster members , particularly for those clusters projected against populous star fields .",
    "while for membership assessment only relative radial velocities are required , experimentation suggested that our data could be used for independent velocity determinations .",
    "the procedures adopted are described below .",
    "we used a fortran program to determine velocities by cross correlation against a template spectrum .",
    "ngc 6809 star 2441 ( ii-4 - 41 ) ,  = 180 , served as our template .",
    "all spectra were continuum normalized and rebinned to a log @xmath15 scale .",
    "the correlation function , @xmath16 between the program spectra ( @xmath17 ) and the template spectrum ( @xmath18 ) was calculated to be the sum of @xmath19 between @xmath20    to @xmath21     ( which corresponds to @xmath228345    to 8745",
    " ) for a large range of @xmath23 values .",
    "these limits were chosen to avoid telluric h@xmath240 features between @xmath081008300   , and @xmath25 8800   .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath26 and the adjoining @xmath273 @xmath23 values were then fit by a parabola whose center provided the initial velocity estimate .",
    "the program spectra were then doppler shifted by the initial velocity estimate and the cross correlation repeated to get an additional velocity shift which ensured that the same wavelength region in each spectrum was being used in the correlation ; this process was repeated until the velocity shift was stable to well within our errors .",
    "the final velocity was used to shift the spectra to the template velocity , so that the band windows used in  [ ew ] to calculate the s were aligned properly .      given a stable cassegrain spectrograph insensitive to rotation angle and changing gravity vector , the uncertainties in our velocities",
    "will be dominated by slit centering errors . in order to achieve maximum throughput as well as reliable relative velocities",
    ", considerable care was spent in the slit rotation process to ensure that the prime pair of stars was well centered on the 1.25@xmath4 wide slit .",
    "this width corresponded to 1.47 pixels on the image plane , or 3.22     @xmath097  at 8500   .",
    "as shown below , our velocities per star appear to be accurate to @xmath28  , after centering and other uncertainties are considered .",
    "our observational procedure ensured a large sample of stars for each run that were observed at least twice consecutively with the same exposure time . from these",
    ", the standard deviation of the velocity measurement could be determined and compared to the mean  of the spectrum .",
    "the results are found in figure  [ sonvel.grp ] . the median standard deviation for run one , 7.7  , and for run two , 8.0  , are indicative of the internal precision and correspond to measuring shifts between the program spectra and the template spectrum at the @xmath00.1 pixel level , which is typical for cross correlation techniques .",
    "several tests enable us to characterize the external accuracy of our data ; these include comparison of observations on different nights within a run , observations on different runs , and observations with different spectrograph rotations .",
    "we generally have three consecutive spectra for every slit position , so comparisons below are made between the median of each group taken under the different conditions . the absolute value of the difference between two observations , each with standard error @xmath8 , has an expectation value of @xmath29 ; this formulae was used below to estimate the standard error where appropriate .",
    "star 3204 in ngc 3201 ( see table  [ stars ] ) was observed consecutively 19 times during run one at positions ranging over the entire length of the slit .",
    "the standard deviation of the velocity was 14.2  , and no significant trend of derived velocity was found as a function of position along the slit .",
    "there were 223 and 37 stars observed on more than one night of runs one and two , respectively ; there were no significant differences found from night to night , and the standard errors derived from the mean absolute value of the star differences were @xmath30(s.d . )  , and @xmath31(s.d . )  ,  respectively .",
    "fourteen and seven stars were observed in runs one and two , respectively , with different spectrograph rotation angles .",
    "the standard errors derived from the mean absolute differences were , respectively , 14@xmath279  ( s.d . )  and 22@xmath2710  ( s.d . )  ; in neither case was a trend observed as a function of rotation angle . from 15 stars observed in common between the two runs , the mean difference between the velocities ( run two@xmath32run one ) was @xmath33 10.1  ( s.d . )  .",
    "an independent estimate of our uncertainties taking into account the internal velocity dispersion of the clusters was made by comparing our velocities with results from  [ vel_results ] .",
    "our calculated dispersion , @xmath34 , for each cluster for which we had 10 or more stars was compared to the internal velocity dispersion , @xmath35 , as given by pryor and meylan ( 1993 ) .",
    "the mean excess in dispersion for 25 such clusters is @xmath365.7  ( s.d . )  .    in summary , while the internal precision of an individual stellar velocity appears to be @xmath08  , the more relevant external uncertainties ( arising from centering errors , flexure , etc . )",
    "are @xmath016  .",
    "the velocity of each star relative to its cluster velocity given in the mwgc catalog is presented in table  [ stars ] .",
    "as noted earlier , star 2441 ( ii-4 - 41 ) of ngc  6809 ( m55 ) was chosen as our template for the cross correlations .",
    "since we did not observe radial velocity standard stars , its ex post facto choice was based upon it being a relatively high  observation of a globular cluster giant from a cluster with a well determined radial velocity and velocity dispersion . to produce velocities on the standard system",
    "we need to assign a velocity to 2441 .",
    "we could have chosen to use the mwgc catalog value ( 174.9@xmath270.4 ) for the cluster , and ignore the possibility that this star might have a detectable offset therefrom .",
    "the latter possibility seems ruled out by the unpublished measurements of pryor and collaborators who used the radial velocity scanner on the canada - france - hawaii telescope , where the velocity of 2441 was found to be 177.6@xmath270.5  relative to the cluster mean velocity ( for a 20 star dataset ) , 176.6@xmath270.9 , and a cluster velocity dispersion of 3.8  .",
    "we chose , however , to set the template velocity zero point by minimizing the difference between our cluster velocity estimates and those given in the mwgc catalog , as we now describe .",
    "our initial cluster velocity estimate was the median velocity after five iterations of 3@xmath8 clipping .",
    "our final cluster velocity estimate also accounted for the central internal velocity dispersion , @xmath35 , of each cluster .",
    "the latter values , listed in table  [ clusters ] , are from pryor and meylan ( 1993 ) .",
    "if the cluster was not listed by pryor and meylan , then a typical value of 5  was used . using our estimate of the external error in the measurement of the velocity of a single observation of a single star , @xmath37  ( see  [ vel_err ] ) for our measurement error , the observed dispersion for",
    "each cluster should be @xmath38 .",
    "the mean of all stars within @xmath39 of our initial velocity estimate form our final cluster velocity estimate , @xmath40 . if these stars are drawn from a normal distribution with @xmath41 , then the variance in @xmath40 can be estimated as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the number of stars entering the mean , and @xmath44 is a constant that is determined below .    to obtain the template velocity zero point , we compared our velocity determinations of 16 clusters for which the mwgc catalog quotes velocity errors @xmath451  , and for which our estimate was based upon @xmath4610 stars .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath40 be the catalog and our values , respectively . for each cluster ,",
    "the difference , @xmath47 , and the variance , @xmath48 , were calculated ( where the value of @xmath44 in @xmath49 was set to 1 in this analysis ) .",
    "the velocity of the template , @xmath50 , was taken to be the weighted mean ( @xmath51 ) of @xmath52 , 172  .",
    "the mean error of unit weight ( @xmath53 ) was calculated as follows :    @xmath54^{\\frac{1}{2 } } = 2.3,\\ ] ]    where the sum is over the 16 clusters used and @xmath55 .",
    "the uncertainty in our template velocity zero point is then taken to be @xmath56 if we accept the cluster velocity errors given in the mwgc catalog , then the @xmath53 value above indicates that @xmath57 , in the definition of @xmath58 , will give a realistic external error estimate for @xmath40 .",
    "it is unclear why @xmath53 is 2.3 rather than 1 ; either the normal error estimate , @xmath59 , is not appropriate for our error distribution , or the errors quoted in the mwgc catalog are underestimated ( e.g. , perhaps the quoted errors are more correct estimates of internal errors , rather than external errors ) .    in summary , we assign a velocity of @xmath60 to star 2441 , and our external uncertainties for the cluster velocities are , @xmath61 , where @xmath43 is the number of stars entering the mean .      our cluster results are presented in table  [ cluster_res ] , where the columns are respectively , 1,2,3 ) as in table  [ clusters ] ; 4,5,6 ) our mean cluster velocity , @xmath40 , external error , @xmath58 , and the number of stars used to estimate the mean velocity , @xmath43 ; 7,8 ) the difference @xmath47 , and @xmath62 , where the @xmath6 values can be found in table  [ clusters ] ; 9,10,11 ) the reduced equivalent width ,  of the cluster , its associated uncertainty , @xmath63 , and the mean error of unit weight , m.e.1 , in the fit of the cluster as described in  [ reduced_ew ] .",
    "the difference between each star s velocity and the cluster velocity given in the mwgc catalog is plotted in figure  [ veldiff.grp ] , and the individual stellar velocities are tabulated in table  [ stars ] in  [ catalog ] , below .    while the goal of this project was not to determine accurate cluster velocities ,",
    "it is reassuring that our cluster velocity estimates generally agree well with the estimates given in the mwgc catalog , with only five clusters having differences greater than 3@xmath8 : ngcs 2298 , 5897 , 6101 , 6553 , and 6981 .",
    "for ngcs 2298 , 5897 and 6101 , g95 recently reported velocities of @xmath64  , @xmath65  and @xmath66  , respectively .",
    "in all three cases the differences between our velocities and theirs are less than @xmath67 .",
    "finally , ngcs  6235 , 6528 and 6681 presented particular challenges when identifying stars to define the initial velocity estimate .",
    "for ngc  6235 , there was no obvious grouping of velocity measures in our sample ; therefore , the catalog velocity was used as the first estimate of this cluster s velocity and only five stars satisfied the iterative clipping procedures to determine our velocity , which differs from the catalog value by @xmath68 .",
    "ngc  6528 , with ( _ l , b ) = ( @xmath69,@xmath70 ) , is projected onto the dense star fields of the galactic center .",
    "however its high radial velocity made it reasonable to reject all the stars with velocities near 0  , which are most likely bulge stars , when determining the initial estimate ; eight stars survived the clipping to enter our final velocity , which differs from the catalog value by 3.4@xmath8 .",
    "however , membership remains something of a concern for any cluster with such contamination problems .",
    "similarly , ngc  6681 is close to the bulge , but has a high radial velocity . since there was a group of stars close to the velocity quoted in the catalog , and a scattering of stars with velocities closer to 0  , the median velocity of the five stars close to the catalog velocity was used as a first estimate of this cluster s velocity , which produced a final cluster velocity estimate that differs from the catalog value by 0.1@xmath8 . due to these problems ,",
    "the cluster velocities we obtain , and our assignment of membership probabilities for stars from these three clusters , are less reliable than those for the other 49 clusters . _      for each cluster , a gaussian probability distribution function ( pdf )",
    "was defined , @xmath71 , which represents the probability that a star with velocity @xmath72 was drawn from the assumed cluster gaussian velocity distribution with mean @xmath40 and @xmath73^{0.5}$ ] as defined in  [ zero ] .",
    "a field star population was defined by selecting all stars which differed from their cluster velocity by more than @xmath74 .",
    "of the 976 stars in our sample , 158 fit this criterion . these presumed field stars form a symmetrical distribution about @xmath75 0  , and are satisfactorily fit by a gaussian with @xmath76 = 75  .",
    "therefore , the field pdf was defined as @xmath77 . to define accurately the probability of a star being a velocity member of a given cluster , it is also necessary to know the relative number density of cluster stars and field stars for each cluster at the radii where we observed . to first order",
    ", this number can be estimated as the total number of cluster stars in our sample over the total number of field stars , as defined above ( i.e. @xmath78 ) .",
    "the probability that a star is a cluster member on the basis of its velocity relative to the cluster mean is , @xmath79 this approach to assigning individual star membership probabilities offers at least two advantages compared to simple @xmath8-clipping .",
    "first , it allows for the greater ease of distinguishing between field and cluster stars when the cluster has a high velocity .",
    "second , a star whose velocity deviates from the cluster mean in the direction of @xmath80  is more likely to be a field star than one that deviates in the opposite direction .",
    "these two effects are reflected in our probability scheme since the field star population is centered on @xmath80  , and the cluster population is centered on @xmath40 .",
    "membership probabilities thus calculated are listed for each star in table  [ stars ] .",
    "measurement of the  of an absorption feature is usually done by defining continuum bandpasses on each side of the feature , and linearly interpolating the average or median intensities in each of the bandpasses to define the continuum at the feature wavelength .",
    "the  is then the integral over the feature bandpass of the difference between the continuum and the feature ( see  [ bandpass ] ) . the feature is defined either directly by the spectral intensities or by some analytical function fitted to them ( see  [ line_fit ] ) . for  triplet work , it is also necessary to combine the three lines in some manner to get a net  index , which we will denote as   ( see  [ ew * ] ) .",
    "table  [ ew_tech ] summarizes the approaches used by previous practicioners of  triplet work , where the columns are , respectively : 1 ) the referenced paper ; 2 ) the method used to combine the three  triplet lines into a single  index for the star , ; 3 ) the method used to define the line feature in the spectrum ; 4 ) the reference for bandpass limits used to define the continuum and feature regions .",
    "table  [ bands ] defines the bandpasses that were adopted by other authors and by ourselves3    for the earlier studies , with values ranging from 2.5    ( olszewski et al .",

    "a technique was then developed to minimize .",

    "three different techniques were tested for measuring equivalent widths : direct numerical integration , fitting the line with a gaussian function , and fitting the line with a moffat function of exponent 2.5 . initially the az88 line bandpasses were used , and for the continuum bandpasses the az88 definition was used for , and the ad91 definition was used for  and  ( see table  [ bands ] ) , which we will refer to as the az88/ad91 continuum bandpasses . between both runs , there was a total of 600 , 764 , and 750 stars used for , , and ,  respectively .",
    "the first six rows of table  [ ew_diag ] show that compared to the numerical method , the gaussian method shows an improvement in  of @xmath010% on average , and compared to the gaussian method , the moffat method shows an improvement of @xmath04% on average .",
    "in addition , when plotting the deviations from the fitted profile for _ all our spectra , it is clear that the moffat fit shows no obvious systematic differences from the observed profile , except for slightly underestimating the wings . on the other hand ,",
    "the gaussian fit underestimates the depth of the line by @xmath05% , overestimates the fwhm by @xmath010% , and grossly underestimates the depth of the wings .",
    "we have therefore adopted the moffat fitting technique for the remainder of our analysis . to quantify the differences between the line fitting techniques",

    "the  values for these line bandpasses represent a 16.5% reduction , on average , from the armandroff line bandpasses .",
    "although smaller line bandpasses significantly decrease the  values , they also dramatically increase sensitivity to changes in the instrumental profile , which in turn , induce systematic errors in our calculated equivalent widths .",

    "since sk96 , and s92 showed that the slope reduces to @xmath00.35 for rgb stars with @xmath129 , we have calculated for each cluster excluding these stars , which represents only @xmath04% of our total sample .",
    "we have also excluded stars which appear to be agb stars , hb stars , have an uncertain i d , or lie significantly off the locus defined by the other stars in the ,  plot .",

    "the inhomogeneous nature of the photometry used to establish the ordinate in figure  [ ewcmd.grp ] seems likely to be the dominant source of scatter .",

    "the @xmath53 value here is calculated as it was for individual clusters , except the sum is over the number of stars in _ all clusters with @xmath155 , and @xmath123 is this number minus 53 ( i.e. , the number of clusters used plus one ) .",
    "this slope is consistent with the slopes that previous authors have found , even though our transformation results (  [ transform ] ) suggest that our slope should be slightly shallower .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that other authors have not allowed for errors in @xmath158 when calculating the slope , which causes the fitting technique to underestimate the true slope ( stetson 1989 ) .",
    "this method of calculating the mean slope is more effective than simply taking the mean of slopes fit independently , since clusters with stars having a small range in , and therefore possessing little slope information , simply add noise to the latter method , whereas they do not affect the former .",
    "the final fit for each cluster is plotted in figure  [ ewcmd.grp ] .",

    "none of the slopes for the metallicity bins differs significantly from the @xmath162 found for the whole sample , nor is there compelling evidence that more metal - rich clusters differ in this regard .",
    "accordingly , we will continue to assume that the slope is constant for all metallicities . with better photometry and membership information , this point would be well worth revisiting in the future .",
    "the results for individual stars are given in table  [ stars ] , where the columns are , respectively : 1 ) the star name ; 2 ) the difference between our calculated velocity of the star ( see  [ radvel ] ) , and the cluster velocity given in the mwgc catalog ; 3 ) the v magnitude of the star above the horizontal branch ; 4 ) the de - reddened  color of the star determined with  from the mwgc catalog ; 5 ) the weighted mean  of the star , calculated according to  [ ew ] ; 6 ) the external error of the weighted mean ; 7 ) the probability of cluster membership from proper motion data ; 8) the probability of cluster membership from our calculated velocities ( see   [ vel_mem ] ) ; 9,10,11 ) the @xmath163 values and final weight , @xmath164 respectively , used in our fitting technique to calculate the reduced equivalent width , , of the cluster ( see  [ reduced_ew ] for technique , and table  [ cluster_res ] for  values ) ; the weight has been scaled in each cluster so that the highest weight star in the cluster has @xmath165 ; 12 ) the number of spectra analyzed for the star ; 13 ) the nights that the star was observed , where the first number indicates the observing run , and the other numbers indicate the specific night of observation .",

    "<S> we have obtained 2640 ccd spectra with resolution @xmath04    in the region 72509000    for 976 stars lying near the red giant branches in color - magnitude diagrams of 52 galactic globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> radial velocities of @xmath016  accuracy per star determined from the spectra are combined with other criteria to assess quantitative membership probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the equivalent widths of the infrared calcium triplet lines yield a relative metal - abundance ranking with a precision that compares favorably to other techniques </S>",
    "<S> . regressions between our system and those of others are derived . </S>",
    "<S> our reduction procedures are discussed in detail , and the resultant catalog of derived velocities and equivalent widths is presented . </S>",
