    "understanding how young stellar objects ( ysos ) assemble themselves and how the accretion process works requires understanding the structure and evolution of the inner disk on size scales @xmath1 0.1 au .",
    "even with the advent of infrared ( ir ) and radio interferometry , imaging of even the nearest ysos to detect structure on these size scales is impractical .",
    "it therefore becomes necessary to infer the spatial structure and composition on these size scales indirectly from , for example , spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , high - resolution spectra , or variability studies .",
    "seds have provided some of the most important insights into the structure and evolution of the inner disks of ysos .",
    "these seds have been used not only to argue for the presence of an inner disk wall , located roughly at the dust sublimation boundary , but also that the upper edge of the wall is in most cases curved ( mcclure et al .",
    "some ysos have both inner and outer optically thick disks separated by an optically thin gap , with the gap likely the result of gravitational sweeping by an embedded giant planet ( quillen et al .",
    "mid - ir spectrophotometric variability seen in a number of ysos suggest that the height of their inner disk wall varies by up to 20% on timescales of days or weeks ( espaillat et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "optical or near - ir photometric variability studies offer another path to understanding inner disk structure and to the physics of the interaction between the inner disk and the parent star .",
    "such studies date back more than half a century ( joy 1945 ) , where variability was used as one of the defining characteristics of the new class of young , forming stars .",
    "herbst et al .  ( 1994 ) summarized the available information on t  tauri star variability , identifying several different classes dominated variously by rotational modulation of cold or hot spots , variable accretion or variable extinction .",
    "variable extinction is particularly attractive as a means to study inner disk structure because in principle it can yield information on very small size scales , if the cadence of the time series photometry is high enough .",
    "bouvier et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that aa tau has broad , periodic flux dips whose amplitude and shape vary from epoch to epoch , which they ascribe to variable extinction resulting from a warp in the star s inner disk and to large variation in the amount of material at the inner disk rim on @xmath2week timescales .",
    "photometric surveys of entire star forming regions ( e.g. , carpenter et al .",
    "2001 ; flaherty et al .  2012 ; findeisen et al .",
    "2013 ) with modern 2-d arrays have also allowed other types of variable extinction events  both periodic and aperiodic  to be identified .",
    "we have recently obtained the highest cadence , highest signal - to - noise ( s / n ) time domain survey of a large population of ysos in a star - forming region during two campaigns in 2008 and 2011 .",
    "we have used those data for ngc  2264 for an initial study of the aa tau - type variables in the cluster ( alencar et al .",
    "2010 ) ; to provide a statistical basis for a new yso light - curve morphology classification scheme ( cody et al .",
    "2014 ) ; and to identify a set of ysos whose light curves are dominated by short duration accretion bursts ( stauffer et al .",
    "2014 ) . in this paper",
    ", we use this dataset to identify a small set of ysos whose light curves exhibit short duration , often near - gaussian shaped , periodic flux dips which must arise from dust structures near the inner disk wall . in a companion paper ( mcginnis et al .",
    "2015 ) , we provide a quantitative analysis of all of the other ysos in our ngc  2264 sample with flux dips due to variable extinction events .",
    "a detailed description of the photometric data we collected in our 2008 and 2011 observing campaigns for the ngc  2264 star - forming region is provided in cody et al .",
    "the subset of the data sources that we use here include several sets of time - series , photometric monitoring data ( the first four items below ) plus additional single - epoch ancillary photometry ( the last two items ) : 0.05truein a 2008 campaign using the _ corot _ ( convection , rotation , and planetary transits ; baglin et al .",

    "the observing cadence was generally every 512 seconds ; however , bright targets and targets of known special interest could be done at 32 second cadence ( and the spacecraft could autonamously switch to 32 second cadence if transit - like events were detected ) .",
    "the passband is set just by the sensitivity curve for the _ corot _ ccd , corresponding to a broad v @xmath3 r filter .",
    "only stars present in an input catalog have _ corot _ light curves .",
    "for each cataloged star , a specific pixel mask was designated to determine which set of pixels was queried to derive the photometry for that star . for the light curves discussed in this paper and illustrated in the figures , typical rms uncertainties in the corot relative photometry range from about 2 mmag at the bright end ( e.g. mon-250 , figure  [ fig : sixctts]a ) to about 6 mmag at the faint end ( mon-6975 , figure  [ fig : sixctts]f ) . 0.05truein a 2011 campaign designated as sra05 within the _ corot _ mission , with data collected from roughly mjd 55897 to 55936 .",
    "the noise level in these light curves is both higher and more spatially variable due to increased ccd radiation damage . in some cases ,",

    "if a clump of circumstellar dust passes through our line of sight to a yso , the light from the star will dim by an amount roughly proportional to the column density of dust , modified according to the size distribution of the grains ( if the clump is optically thin ) , or by an amount proportional to the fractional area of the star that is covered ( if the clump is optically thick but small in angular size relative to the star ) .",
    "if the dust clump is long lived and relatively fixed in location , the flux dips it produces should be periodic at the keplerian rotation period for that clump .",
    "for some stars , a warped inner disk has been invoked ( e.g. , aa tau  bouvier et al .  1999 ;",
    "flaherty & muzerolle 2010 ) to explain deep flux dips that extend over half or more of the star s rotation period .",
    "dust clumps produced by instability processes in the disk , and levitated above the disk plane into our line of sight , could produce flux dips that do not repeat ( turner et al .",
    "2010 ) . other longer timescale variable extinction events could be associated with keplerian rotation in the outer disk bringing dust into our line of sight ( bouvier et al.2013 ) ; with orbital motion of a binary system causing our line of sight to intersect a circumbinary disk ( plavchan et al .",
    "2008a ) ; or with dust entrained in a spatially or temporally variable disk wind ( bans & knigl 2012 ) .",
    "in our 40 + day monitoring of the star - forming region ngc2264 with _ corot _ and _ spitzer _ , we have identified three different morphological light curve signatures which appear to be associated with variable extinction events .",
    "figure  [ fig : sixctts ] shows light curves for ngc  2264 classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) which illustrate each of these different modes .",
    "these three modes are :    * aa tau analogs ( examples illustrated in figure  [ fig : sixctts]a and b. ) light curves of this type have relatively flat continua , punctuated by deep , broad flux dips occurring at the keplerian orbital period for material near the inner disk rim .",
    "the generally accepted physical explanation is that there is a warp in the inner disk , and that a portion of this warp occults our line of sight ( bouvier et al .",
    "1999 ) ; * aperiodic extinctors ( examples illustrated in figure  [ fig : sixctts]c and d. ) light curves of this type have relatively flat continua and deep , narrow and/or broad flux dips but with no obvious periodicity . a possible physical mechanism",
    "is dust levitated relatively high above the disk mid - plane by magneto - resonance instabilities ( mri ) or other instabilities , which then settles back towards the mid - plane , accretes onto the star , or escapes or sublimates on timescales of hours to days .",
    "see mcginnis et al .",
    "( 2015 ) for a discussion of these stars ; * short duration , periodic dippers ( newly identified group - examples illustrated in figure  [ fig : sixctts]e and f ) .",
    "light curves of this type have relatively shallow , relatively narrow flux dips with periods generally in the range 3 - 10 days , and with dip shapes often approximately gaussian . sometimes these dips are superposed on a relatively flat continuum , but sometimes the dips are superposed on sine - wave light variations which we attribute to other physical mechanisms . a physical mechanism for these flux dips must also involve dust structures in or near the inner disk rim that are brought into our line of sight by orbital motion .",
    "we discuss options for the origin of these structures in  7 .",
    "there are other types of variables  primarily eclipsing binaries ( or systems with transiting exoplanets )  which also have narrow flux dips in their light curves , but their light curves are distinctively different from those illustrated throughout this paper .",
    "figure  [ fig : eb_lightcurves ] shows two eclipsing binary ( eb ) light curves from the 2008 ngc  2264 campaign .",
    "figure  [ fig : eb_lightcurves]a is the light curve for mon-256 , a dm - dm binary member of ngc  2264 ( gillen et al .",
    "2014 ) that is a borderline ctts ( broad and structured h@xmath7 profile ; modest ir excess ) ; this is the only eb in ngc  2264 with an ir excess presumably due to circumstellar or circumbinary dust . for well - detached systems , eclipses by stellar - sized bodies yield flux dips that are of much shorter duration ( with a gaussian fit width of @xmath8 = 0.045 days for the eclipses of mon-256 ) than those which we study in this paper . the eclipse depths for mon-256 appear to vary considerably with time primarily due to the varying continuum level  once that is removed , the depths are quite stable , though slightly different at the primary and secondary eclipse since each star has slightly different radius and effective temperature . figure  [ fig : eb_lightcurves]b shows the light curve of a field star projected towards ngc  2264 ; its light curve is that for a near - contact binary ( @xmath9 11 day ) where the continuum variations are primarily due to the ellipsoidal shapes of the stars superposed on which are narrow flux dips from the primary and secondary eclipses .",
    "the gaussian width for the eclipse dip in this case ( @xmath8 = 0.21 days ) is within the range of the widths for the short - duration flux dips we discuss in this paper .",
    "however , the regularity imposed in an eb system yields a very stable light curve which is easily distinguishable from light curves associated with variable circumstellar extinction .",
    "first results from our 2011 - 2012 intensive monitoring of ngc 2264 with _",
    "corot _ and _ spitzer _ have been published in cody et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and stauffer et al .",
    "while working on those papers , we noticed a small set of stars that shared some similarities but did not seem to fit into the primary groupings identified by cody et al . often , the  narrow \" flux dips in these light curves are superposed on other , larger amplitude , types of variability  primarily semi - sinusoidal light curves normally attributed to photospheric spots  making identification of this new light curve signature more difficult .",
    "these narrow flux dips presumably arise because some physical structure transits our line of sight to the stellar photosphere .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , there is already a light curve class ( aa tau analogs ) with periodic , variable extinction events and for which a standard physical model has been developed .",
    "it is possible that this new light curve class can be fit into the same physical model ; however , we believe there are a number of reasons to consider alternate physical models which we will discuss in  7 . to emphasize the primary morphological differences between the  classical \" aa tau analogs and our proposed new class , figure  [ fig : compare_dippers ]",
    "compares the average widths and depths of the flux dips for the new group of stars to those of the aa tau analogs in ngc  2264 identified in the companion paper by mcginnis et al .",
    "while the distribution of points in figure  [ fig : compare_dippers ] could be regarded as simply one population with a range of properties , it could also be viewed as two populations whose properties only slightly overlap .",
    "the goal of this paper is to better characterize the light curves with these narrow flux dips , thereby determining if they should be considered as a new class of event or if they should simply be regarded as an extension of the aa tau class . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the terms  narrow \" and  short - duration \" interchangeably to describe the flux - dips of this set of stars , and  broad \" ( or long - duration ) to describe the flux dips for the classic aa tau light curves , with the dividing line being approximately fwhm / period = 0.25 ( see figure  [ fig : compare_dippers ] ) .    in table",

    "we have ascribed the sinusoidal variations to non - axisymmetrically distributed star spots on the stellar photosphere ",
    "probably cold spots .",
    "could it instead be ascribed to variable extinction due to a warped disk intersecting our line of sight ?",
    "we offer two arguments in favor of our hypothesis and counter to the alternative .",
    "first , we know what the light curves of ysos with typical warped disks look like because there are many of them in ngc  2264 ( see the companion paper to this , mcginnis et al .",
    "those light curves look nothing like the semi - sinusoidal pattern shown in red in figure  [ fig : mon21_modela]b ; the warped disk light curves are much more irregularly shaped and much more time variable .",
    "second , we also know that light curves dominated by non - axisymmetrically distributed , high - latitude spots are common amongst ysos ( herbst 1986 ; bouvier & bertout 1989 ) and their light curves closely resemble the red curve in figure  [ fig : mon21_modela]b .",
    "in fact , we have identified one ctts in ngc  2264  mon-103  whose _ corot _ light curve is nearly identical , except for minor scale factors , to the red curve in figure  [ fig : mon21_modela]b .",
    "we provide a quantitative comparison of the 2008 mon-21 light curve and that for mon-103 in the appendix .",
    "figures  [ fig : mon21_modela]e and f compare a gaussian fit to the observations for the dips that are narrowest and best fit by such a model ( dips b and d - see table  [ tab : quant_information ] ) .",
    "the derived times , gaussian widths and dip depths ( as a percentage of the  continuum \" flux ) are provided in table  [ tab : quant_information ] .",
    "most of the dips are well fit , and most have widths in the narrow range from 0.15 to 0.18 days .    the semi - sinusoidal pattern and the narrow flux dips both have apparent periodicities of about 3.2 days . however , are the dips exactly periodic ? and , are the periods for the semi - sinusoidal waveform and the dips precisely the same ?",
    "the answer to the first question is no , as can be seen from examination of the data in table  [ tab : quant_information ] .",
    "the centroids of each dip can be measured to an accuracy of a few hundredths of a day , yet dip b and c are separated by 3.08 days , while dips c and d are separated by 3.40 days .",
    "applying the period - finding algorithm of plavchan et al.(2008b ) to the light curve for just the flux dips ( figure  [ fig : mon21_modela]c ) yields a period of 3.224 days ; a similar estimate of 3.223 days is obtained by subtracting the measured times for dip e1 and a1 and assuming they are separated by six periods .",
    "the lomb - scargle algorithm yields a period of 3.15 days for the semi - sinusoidal pattern ( represented either just by the red curve in figure  [ fig : mon21_modela]b or by the residual remaining after subtracting the gaussian fits from the original light curve ) .",
    "given the real variations in the timing of the flux dips and the comparative shortness of our _ corot _ campaign , we can not conclude the two periods are significantly different .      by 2011 ,",
    "the _ corot _ light curve for mon-21 changed morphology , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : mon21_corot]a .",
    "the semi - sinusoidal pattern is either essentially absent or much reduced in amplitude .",
    "the flux dips appear somewhat broader and in many cases asymmetric .",
    "one possibility is that we are still seeing a blend of a spotted waveform and narrow flux dips from variable extinction , with the spot being responsible for the weaker feature causing the apparent asymmetry in each observed waveform ; another possibility is that spots no longer contribute in any significant way and the observed waveforms are due to the blend of two narrow dips . in order to document the full light curve shape , we have chosen to simply model the observed features with gaussian fits , usually with two components ; the fits to a number of the dips are shown in figure  [ fig : mon21_corot ] . on average ,",
    "the primary dip at each epoch has a gaussian sigma width of 0.26@xmath100.02 days , about 50% broader than the dips in 2008 .",
    "the weaker secondary dips always precede the deeper dip .",
    "see table  [ tab : quant_information ] for the fit parameters .",
    "the average period inferred from the dip centroids is 3.16@xmath100.02 days , somewhat different from the dip period in 2008 , but essentially equal to the period for the sinusoidal waveform we attribute to spots on the stellar surface .",
    "a ground - based usno @xmath5-band light curve for mon-21 is available that overlaps in time with the _ corot _ light curve . for a star of mon-21 s i magnitude ,",

    "figure  [ fig : mon21_usno]a shows an expanded view of the region of best overlap between the _ corot _ and usno data ; figure  [ fig : mon21_usno]b shows the entire usno light curve .",
    "these data illustrate that the same flux dip structure is detected in the ground - based data , and that it persists for at least twenty days after the end of the _ corot _ campaign . because the ground - observing only provided data for about 5 - 6 hours per night , the window function for detecting the flux dips in the usno data is not very good and it is not possible to deduce whether similar depth flux dips persisted beyond mjd 55960 .",
    "we also obtained a _",
    "spitzer_/irac [ 3.6 ] light curve for mon-21 in 2011 . as shown in cody et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , for a star of mon-21 s brighness , the expected rms uncertainty in the relative irac photometry should be of order 1% .",
    "the most obvious feature of the irac light curve is a gradual flux decrease of 0.25 mag beginning around mjd 55910 . on small timescales , there are possible correspondences between the _ corot _ flux dips and features in the irac data , but there are also places where there is no correspondence . given the shallowness of the dips in the _ corot _ data , and that the disk contributes equal or more light at [ 3.6 ] , the lack of distinct dips in the ir is not unexpected .      in many respects , mon-56 is a near twin to mon-21 .",
    "it also has a published spectral type of k5 ( dahm & simon 2005 ) , h@xmath7emission with an inverse p - cygni profile but quite small equivalent width ( furesz et al .",
    "2006 ) , essentially no uv excess and ir colors placing it near the center of the class  ii population in the irac color - color diagram ( allen et al .",
    "similar to mon-21 , we interpret its _ corot _ light curve in 2011 as also being the superposition of two components with essentially identical periods - a smoothly varying , semi - sinusoidal component , possibly due to star - spots and a system of periodic , shallow , short duration flux dips which are sometimes single and sometimes double . figure  [ fig : mon56_corot]a shows the as - observed _ corot _ light curve .",
    "compared to mon-21 , however , the mon-56 light curve is more difficult to deconvolve because the flux dips are generally stronger and broader and in phase with the flux minima of the sinusoidal waveform , thereby making it harder to construct a high quality model for the spotted light curve ( or to be certain that this component is indeed due to spots as opposed to a warped - disk model ) .",
    "we have therefore resorted to a lower fidelity but simpler model for the smoothly varying component of the light curve  specifically , we adopt a simple sine - wave , whose phase , amplitude and period we set to yield the best fit ( i.e. to yield a residual light curve with a nearly flat continuum level interspersed with narrow dips ) . figure  [ fig : mon56_corot]b shows our final model for the smoothly varying component of the light curve superposed on the observed mon-56 light curve , and figure  [ fig : mon56_corot]c shows the result of subtracting this model from the observations , yielding our best visualization of the short - duration flux dips in this star . the full amplitude of the adopted sinusoid is 0.06 mag ( about 6% ) , and the period is 5.83 days ( the same as determined from ground - based monitoring by lamm et al .",
    "because of the approximate nature of the deconvolution , we attempt to derive flux dip fits only for the three strongest features in figure  [ fig : mon56_corot]c .",
    "those parameters are provided in table  [ tab : quant_information ] and the fits are illustrated for the apparently single flux dips in figure  [ fig : mon56_corot]d and e.    we note that the mon-56 _ corot _ data are interpreted differently in mcginnis et al .",

    "we assume that any physical model to explain the short duration flux dips will have as its starting point that the dips are due to our line of sight being intercepted by structures in or near the inner circumstellar disk that rotate through and occult our line of sight .",

    "the duration of the aa tau flux dips is set by the fraction of the orbital longitude range where the upper edge of the inner wall intersects our line of sight .",
    "even if the height of the upper lip of the disk wall varies smoothly with longitude , there will be certain lines of sight where the longitudinal range which intersects our line of sight is small , resulting in a short - duration , periodic flux dip .",

    "typically , two tongues of gas arise from the inner disk , separated by about 180@xmath25 .",
    "the gas originates from a relatively broad range in longitude and then gathers together into a narrower stream ( it  funnels \" ) .",

    "2005 ; bouvier et al .  2006 ) .",
    "if the gas flow originates from the region near the dust sublimation radius , and that radius is beyond the co - rotation radius , then it will start with a lower angular rotation rate than the star and a trailing spiral pattern will result , as illustrated in figure 1 of romanova & kurosawa ( 2014 ) .",
    "dust could be entrained in this flow and survive briefly as the gas / dust mixture rises above the disk plane ( though the dust will soon sublimate as it flows towards the star ) .",
    "alternatively , bans & knigl ( 2012 ) have advocated that disk winds originating from beyond the dust sublimation radius may levitate sufficient dust to contribute a large fraction of the 3 to 4 micron flux in ysos , and if that wind were significantly non - axisymmetric it could be the source of potentially short - duration flux dips .",
    "we have constructed a toy model of an accretion curtain in order to illustrate constraints that the narrow dip profiles place on such a curtain .",
    "we tune the model to the flux dips in mon-21 .",
    "specifically , the model must produce approximately gaussian shaped flux dips with @xmath39 0.2 days ( fwhm @xmath2 0.45 days ) for a system with @xmath40  = 1.7 @xmath41 , @xmath42 = 3.2 days , and @xmath43 = 9.7 @xmath41 .",
    "we place the curtain at the co - rotation radius . based on the geometrical arguments from  7.1",
    ", we adopt a curtain width of 8 @xmath40 .",
    "we divide the curtain into 8 vertical panels , each of base width 1 @xmath40 ( the left panel of figure  [ fig : toy_funnel ] illustrates the geometry of the toy model ) .",
    "the panels are actually triangles , all meeting at a common apex at height @xmath44 above the midpoint of the curtain . for very large @xmath45 ,",
    "the panel is essentially a vertical wall of width 8 @xmath40 . for @xmath44 = 8 @xmath40 ,",
    "the curtain becomes an equilateral triangle .",
    "we adopt a uniform optical depth of 0.1 for dust within the curtain .",
    "finally , we place the bottom of the curtain so that it is aligned with the bottom of the star as viewed from our vantage point .",
    "we place the edge of the curtain near the leading limb of the star , and let orbital motion ( with the mon-21 period ) carry the curtain in front of the star .    with the above idealized geometry",
    ", we wish to determine if flux dips like that observed can be reproduced - and if so , what range of convergent point heights is allowed ?",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : toy_funnel ] shows the flux dips produced for values of the convergent height from 20 @xmath40 ( bottom ) to 1 @xmath40 ( upper blue curve ) . the model with a convergent height of 1 @xmath40 produces an approximately gaussian shaped profile whose fwhm @xmath2 0.4 days , within the range of dip widths observed for mon-21 .",
    "these results emphasize two things : ( a ) in order to produce a flux dip as broad as observed , an accretion curtain must be quite wide ( several times the stellar diameter ) at its base ; and ( b ) in order to produce the gaussian shape , assuming a uniform dust opacity , the curtain must  funnel \" down to a much smaller region over a very small scale height . the alternative to this would be to assume instead that the curtain has an opacity distribution smoothly varying with longitude , peaking near its midpoint .",
    "what types of limits on opacity variations within the curtain could we detect ?",
    "we constructed one model , for convergent height of 1 @xmath40 , where we set the opacity of one of the panels to half the normal value .",
    "the top model flux dip in figure  [ fig : toy_funnel]b shows this result . for many of the flux dips illustrated in this paper , the observed dip shape is more symmetric than this model and we could exclude an opacity fluctuation of this order . however , some of the flux dips we have shown do have asymmetries which could perhaps be indicative of opacity fluctuations ( rather than as a blend of two gaussian waveforms ) .",
    "one criticism of this model is that it could simply be regarded as a reformulation of the first model .",
    "that is , the tip of a warped disk is the place where one might expect an accretion curtain to form , and whether one labels the dust structure there as part of the disk or the base of the accretion flow is , perhaps , only semantics .",
    "one reason to keep the two ideas separate is that if the line of sight inclinations to mon-21 and especially mon-1131 ( table  [ tab : incl - estim ] ) are confirmed at a value near our current estimates ( @xmath46 40 and 27 degrees , respectively ) , this could not be accomodated within a warped disk model but could be compatible with the accretion curtain model if dust could survive in the accretion flow to heights of several stellar radii above the disk plane . in this case , the duration of the flux dip would be set by the inclination of the accretion flow relative to the orbital axis .",
    "the , on average , later spectral types and dustier disks for the short - duration flux dip stars are not an obvious feature of the model but could possibly be made to fit .",
    "the lower luminosity of the star and the dustier disk could correspond to allowing the base of the accretion column to be located beyond the dust sublimation radius , whereas the higher luminosity , less dusty disks of the classical aa taus might have their accretion columns be dust free . alternatively , the less dusty nature of the aa tau group s disks may simply reflect their higher stellar mass and the expected dependence of disk evolution timescales on stellar mass ( longer timescales for lower mass stars ) .",
    "the short durations and small amplitudes of the flux dips could arise from mountains on the surface of the disk  that is , features standing up above their surroundings .",
    "such features would either be low - relief , sweeping across only the bottom of the star s face but optically thick , or taller , but diffuse and of moderate optical depth .",
    "mountains arising from the disk would naturally cross the star once per local orbit , while varying from one crossing to the next due to the internal turbulence .",
    "the issue is how to lift the mountains above the plains .",
    "one way to produce vertical relief on the disk surface is through vortices driven by rossby wave or baroclinic instabilities .",

    "the resulting v - band photometric amplitude is 1% or less at all viewing angles .",
    "the model vortex thus has too little vertical relief to explain the dips amplitudes .    to account for the possibility that vortices can eventually reach contrasts up to an order of magnitude relative to their surroundings , as suggested by long - duration 2-d hydrodynamical calculations ( regaly et al .",

    "therefore , even this seemingly extreme vortex can not easily explain either the full range of the narrow dip amplitudes or the number of objects in which they occur .",
    "however , vortices concentrate pebble- to boulder - sized rubble ( barge & sommeria 1995 ) , and collisions between the rubble particles could yield fragments that raise the abundance of sub - micron dust even more than by a factor of 10 . determining whether the increase makes vortices a viable explanation for the narrow flux dips will require better models of the dust sources , sinks and transport .      a planet embedded in a disk",

    "hot gas giants can not easily grow in situ , as reviewed by helled et al.(2013 ) .",
    "instead they probably formed outside the snow line and reached their present orbits either by migrating through the disks that gave them birth , or by later dynamical interactions with third bodies ( baruteau et al .",
    "detecting planets interacting with the disks would help separate these possibilities .    to test whether planet - disk interactions could cause the narrow dips , we construct a model using the same 0.5 @xmath47 star and disk as in the vortex picture above .",

    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : spiral ] , where the head of the spiral arm passing in front of the star produces a narrow dip with optical amplitude 2.3% , in the range observed among the stars in ngc  2264 .",
    "a more massive disk or higher dust abundance would likely yield larger amplitudes . also , the spiral arm s star - facing side is hotter than the axisymmetric model used to set up the approximate hydrostatic equilibrium , so that restoring the balance would make the atmosphere expand , increasing the dip amplitude . however whether there is time to reach hydrostatic equilibrium is unclear , since the spiral arm propagates around the disk at the planet s orbital frequency .",
    "a more serious difficulty with this picture is that it yields dips in less than 5% of all randomly - oriented systems , even if every star has a similar hot planet .",
    "the planet - driven bump simply does not extend high enough above the surrounding disk to obscure the star over a wide range of viewing angles .",

    "regardless of the precise physical mechanism for producing the short - duration flux dips , if we are correct in assigning the semi - sinusoidal variations to photospheric spots and the short - duration flux dips to dust in or near the co - rotation radius , then our observations for at least mon-21 ( 2008 ) , mon-378 , and mon-1580 confirm that their stellar rotation rate is locked to the keplerian rotation period at the inner disk .",

    "the stars with isolated , narrow flux dips ( figure  [ fig : singledip_dips ] ) could be systems where dust in an accretion flow has survived to an unusually high distance above the disk plane .",
    "we see only one or two of these dips per 40 day light curve because only rarely does the dust survive long enough to reach a height to intersect our line of sight .",
    "these systems are , therefore , viewed at somewhat smaller inclinations than the other variable extinction stars .",
    "the periodic , narrow flux dip stars are systems viewed at larger inclinations where it is more likely the dust will generally be present in the accretion flows . finally , the classic aa tau analogs are the systems with more evolved ",
    "less dusty  outer disks where we see into the inner disk and where a warped inner disk can then occult our line of sight .",
    "the systems with both broad and narrow flux dips have extinction events produced by dust in both the warped disk and in the accretion funnels .",
    "we offer this scenario primarily as a way to focus future studies .",
    "the main results of this paper are the empirical constraints on the narrow flux - dip light curves and their host stars provided in  6 and  7 , which any model of these events must explain .",
    "a general concern with any model for the variable extinction stars is simply that there seems to be too many of them in ngc  2264 .",
    "there are roughly equal numbers of stars with each of the three light curve types ( aa tau , aperiodic dip , and short - duration dip ) , with about 39 such stars in all , corresponding to about 25% of the total number of ctts for which we have _ corot _ light curves .",

    "if this is also true for the angular momentum vectors of the single stars in ngc  2264 , then we would also detect a higher fraction of variable extinction stars than would be true for a random orientation of axes .",
    "other authors have concluded that the rotational velocities ( @xmath23  and periods ) of stars in open clusters are compatible with a random orientation of axes and incompatible with any strong alignment of axes ( e.g. , kraft 1970 ; jackson & jeffries 2013 ) , so this either argues against such an effect in ngc  2264 or that ngc  2264 is unusual in this respect .",

    "in  4.1.1 , we used the mon-21 light curve itself to generate a model for the portion of the light curve we attribute to spots , and subtracted that model from the data in order to derive an estimate of the light curve structure due to variable extinction . in order to demonstrate that this procedure is adequate to the task , we offer here another means to estimate the flux dip light curve .",
    "all modern studies agree that the dominant physical mechanism which drives the visual appearance of optical light curves for most wtts is the rotational modulation of star - spots that are distributed asymmetrically over the stellar surface .",
    "when these spots are at moderately high - latitude , which is typical , the light curve shapes can be approximately sinusoidal .",
    "dozens of the ngc  2264 _ corot _ light curves fall into this category .",

    "<S> we identify nine young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the ngc  2264 star - forming region with optical _ corot _ light curves exhibiting short - duration , shallow , periodic flux dips . </S>",
    "<S> all of these stars have infrared ( ir ) excesses that are consistent with their having inner disk walls near the keplerian co - rotation radius . </S>",
    "<S> the repeating photometric dips have fwhm generally less than one day , depths almost always less than 15% , and periods ( 3 @xmath0 11 days ) consistent with dust near the keplerian co - rotation period . </S>",
    "<S> the flux dips vary considerably in their depth from epoch to epoch , but usually persist for several weeks and , in two cases , were present in data collected on successive years . for several of these stars </S>",
    "<S> , we also measure the photospheric rotation period and find that the rotation and dip periods are the same , as predicted by standard  disk - locking \" models . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute these flux dips to clumps of material in or near the inner disk wall , passing through our line of sight to the stellar photosphere . in some cases , these dips are also present in simultaneous _ spitzer _ </S>",
    "<S> irac light curves at 3.6 and 4.5 microns . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the properties of these dips , and compare the stars with light curves exhibiting this behavior to other classes of yso in ngc  2264 . </S>",
    "<S> a number of physical mechanisms could locally increase the dust scale height near the inner disk wall , and we discuss several of those mechanisms ; the most plausible mechanisms are either a disk warp due to interaction with the stellar magnetic field or dust entrained in funnel - flow accretion columns arising near the inner disk wall . </S>"
