    "in all the _ fermi _  catalogs there is an important distinction between _ identification _ of low - energy counterparts for the _ fermi _  sources and _ association_. * identification is based on i ) spin or orbital periodicity ( e.g. , pulsars , binary systems ) or on ii ) correlated variability at other wavelengths ( e.g. , blazars , active galaxies ) or on iii ) the consistency between the measured angular sizes in @xmath0-ray and at lower energies ( e.g. , supernova remnants ) .",
    "* on the other hand , the _ association _ designation indeed depends on the results of different procedures adopted in both _",
    "fermi _  catalogs",
    "these procedures are :    1 .   _ the bayesian association method _ : initially applied to associate egret sources with flat - spectrum radio sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this method assesses the probability of association between a @xmath0-ray source and a candidate counterpart taking into account their local densities .",
    "local density is estimated simply by counting candidates in a nearby region of the sky .",
    "2 .   _ the likelihood ratio method _ : used to search for possible counterparts in uniform surveys in the radio and in x - ray bands , this procedure was originally proposed by richter ( 1975 ) and subsequently applied by and modified by de ruiter , willis & arp ( 1977 ) , prestage & peacock ( 1983 ) , wolstencroft et al . ( 1986 ) and by sutherland & saunders ( 1992 ) .",
    "the logn - logs association method _ : this is a modified version of the bayesian method for blazars taking into account their @xmath9-@xmath10 ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "there are several differences between the source associations presented between the 1fgl and the 2fgl catalogs mostly related to the @xmath0-ray analysis and to the improvements achieved in the models of galactic @xmath0-ray diffuse emission as well as in evaluation of the lat response functions .",
    "improving the _ fermi _  source localization not only makes easier the search for low - energy counterparts but allows more accurate estimates of the association probability since they depend on the @xmath0-ray positional uncertainty ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these differences also relate to updates of comparison surveys and catalogs used to search for the low - energy counterparts and on multifrequency observations performed on ugs samples .",
    "the use of catalogs / surveys that were previously not considered for the _ fermi _  catalog preparation , as for example the infrared all - sky survey performed by _ wise _  and the low - frequency radio catalogs , revealing new connections between the low and the high - energy skies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has also decreased the unknown fraction of the @xmath0-ray sky ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this affects the _ fermi _  associations because the methods adopted to assign low - energy counterparts depend on the source densities of the catalogs @xcite .",
    "a better estimate of the counterpart density leads to a better estimate of the false positive associations and of the association probability and this implies that a previously unassociated source could have an assigned counterpart in a new release of the _ fermi _  catalog .    motivated by the changes occurring between the 1fgl and the 2fgl associations here we propose to introduce ,",
    "together with identified and associated sources , the category of _ `` candidate associations''_. these are @xmath0-ray sources that have a potential low - energy counterpart in a specific class of well - known @xmath0-ray emitters lying within the _ fermi _  positional uncertainty region at 95% level of confidence and/or having angular separations between the _ fermi _  and the counterpart position smaller than the maximum one for all the associated sources of the same class .",
    "candidate associations have the potential to be promoted to associations in the future ( see section  [ sec : assoc ] ) .",
    "we considered as counterpart classes for the candidate associations only a few kinds of sources : i ) blazar - like sources , as defined in the following , ii ) known pulsars ( psrs ) , iii ) pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) , supernova remnants ( snrs ) and star forming and hii regions ( hereinafter simply indicated as sfrs ) .",
    "the first two source classes constitute the two largest populations of known @xmath0-ray emitters while the other choices were considered because 15 out of the 44 snrs and 10 out of the 63 psrs and pwne associated in the 1fgl lie within sfrs and a similar situation occurs for the 2fgl .",
    "our choice concerning the sfrs , especially for the most massive cases , is indeed motivated by the possibility that they could host type o and/or b stars , potentially associated with open star clusters , and this being relatively likely to have some members that have progressed to become a psr , pwn , and/or snr , all known classes of @xmath0-ray sources ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , considering sfrs as candidate associations is also motivated by the recent idea , partially supported by the _ fermi _  discovery of @xmath0-ray emission arising from eta carinae @xcite , that shells detected in the radio , infrared , and x - rays could mark termination shocks of stellar winds . these winds interacting with the stars",
    "natal molecular clouds can be considered as plausible sites to accelerate particles that emit @xmath0-rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "bowshocks are associated with many source classes such as psrs , cataclysmic variables , colliding wind binaries , cometary h ii regions and particles accelerated therein can radiate up to the mev - gev energy range ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however we remark that evidence of @xmath0-ray emission from colliding wind binaries associated with wolf - rayet stars was not found by _",
    ", for a selected sample of 7 sources @xcite ; although , as highlighted by the same authors , searching for such @xmath0-ray detections is extremely complicated due to the uncertainties of the diffuse emission in the galactic plane .",
    "some candidate associations lack multifrequency information as well as correct spectroscopic identifications but * exhibit some characteristic * features , typical of known @xmath0-ray emitters , mainly blazars and psrs .",
    "they were not associated in the previous releases of the _ fermi _  catalogs mostly because they were not listed in one of the appropriate comparison catalogs of potential counterparts used to associated _ fermi _  sources .",
    "however once follow up observations * were * performed ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for blazar - like candidates ) , then they could be promoted to associated sources in new releases of the _ fermi _  catalogs .",
    "in addition , within this category we also considered _ fermi _",
    "sources having sfrs within their @xmath0-ray positional uncertainty regions for which multifrequency observations could reveal the presence of unknown psrs , pwne and snrs , already counterparts of @xmath15% of the @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "we emphasize three advantages obtained from introducing the concept of candidate associations :    1 .",
    "designating candidate association category allows us to flag potential counterparts that might be associated or identified in future releases of the _ fermi _  catalogs , as previously occurred to 171 1fgl sources then recognized , classified and associated in the 2fgl .",
    "this also facilitates planning follow up multifrequency observations , in particular spectroscopic ones , necessary to determine and/or confirm their nature .",
    "the category of candidate associations permits us to establish which is the number of _ fermi _  sources not yet having potential counterparts .",
    "the precise knowledge of this number is extremely relevant to set better constraints on dark matter scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "3 .   for all the methods adopted to associate sources in the _ fermi _  catalogs , the resulting associations depend on the comparison catalog / survey used .",
    "the same low - energy counterpart may be associated with a _ fermi _  source using a certain catalog but not with a different survey , even when the positions in the two catalogs are the same .",
    "this occurs because the source density of the comparison catalogs , which is used to determine the probability of false positive associations , affects the association probability . thus observing these candidate associations with",
    "follow up campaigns to determine their natures will permit us to add blazars and pulsars to the correct comparison catalogs and associate them in future releases of the _ fermi _  surveys .    to reiterate the importance of having candidate associations we highlight the recent work of schinzel et al .",
    "( 2014 ) on radio very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of _ fermi _  unassociated sources in the 2fgl ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the final list of high - confidence associations presented in schinzel",
    "et al . ( 2014 ) more than 90% of the sources are also detected in the major radio surveys such * as the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) very large array ( vla ) sky survey catalog ( nvss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . * these counterparts",
    "were not associated using the methods adopted in _",
    "fermi _  catalogs due to the high density of sources at low flux level in the above surveys .",
    "however thanks to the high resolution radio follow up observations , which reveled the presence of radio compact cores , it has been possible to use a different selected sample of potential counterparts to find new associations via the likelihood procedure @xcite .",
    "thus it is extremely important to have targets for follow up observations that , once performed , will allow us to insert the potential counterparts in the correct catalogs used to search @xmath0-ray associations .",
    "identifications , associations and candidate associations of @xmath0-ray sources are labelled in both the refined version of the _ fermi _  catalogs as the _ category of the @xmath0-ray source association_. these are defined as : _ identified _ ( i ) , _ associated _ ( a ) , _ candidate association _ ( c ) in the tables while sources for which no potential counterpart was found are assigned to the ugs category ( u ) .",
    "the 1fgl catalog[multiblock footnote omitted ] contains 1451 sources detected and characterized in the 100 mev to 100 gev energy range . for each _ fermi _  source listed therein , positional uncertainty regions at 68% and 95% level of confidence , results from spectral fits as well as flux measurements in five energy bands are reported @xcite .",
    "firm identification or plausible association with a low - energy counterpart was provided for each 1fgl source on the basis of the comparison with other astronomical catalogs and on the basis of the association procedures previously mentioned ( see section  [ sec : cat ] and abdo et al .",
    "2010a for details ) .",
    "the published 1fgl catalog lists several classes of counterparts : 63 pulsars ( psrs ) , 7 associated plus 56 identified ( 24 of them discovered thanks to the _",

    "the remaining 630 _ fermi _  sources are all ugss .    a detailed comparison between the 1fgl and the 2fgl catalog is reported in nolan et al .",
    "there are 1099 sources included in both _",
    "catalogs with only 381 1fgl sources being listed in the 1fhl @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that 267 out of 1099 sources in common between 1fgl and 2fgl changed classification from 1fgl to 2fgl and among them 172 , previously unassociated in 1fgl , obtained an assigned low - energy counterpart in 2fgl .",
    "this sample of modified associations includes : 16 sources indicated as generic agns that have been classified plus one that became a ugs ; 54 agus that have been recognized as blazars ( either bzbs or bzqs ) and 2 as agns ; then 17 blazars actually changed their classification from 1fgl to 2fgl thanks to new spectroscopic data available and , among them , 6 actually disappeared since they were listed in the 2fgl as unassociated as occurred for other 5 sources of galactic origin ( i.e. , psrs , pwne and snrs ) . on the other hand , there are 172 ugss of the 1fgl that appear to be associated in the 2fgl : 20 associated with psrs , 11 with snrs and 1 with a glc while all the others with various agn classes ( i.e. blazars , radio galaxies , seyfert galaxies etc . ) .",
    "the 1fgl catalog includes 216 sources with @xmath0-ray analysis flags and their detection has to be considered carefully since they could have been artifacts of the analysis @xcite .",
    "in particular , 103 of these 216 1fgl flagged sources have the `` c '' flag following the 1fgl name ; this indicates that the source is found in a region with bright and/or possibly incorrectly modeled diffuse emission . on the other hand any non - zero entry in the flags column indicates inconsistencies found during the analysis ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "however we note that 36 out of 103 `` c''-flagged 1fgl sources are also detected in the 2fgl and only 25 of them were still indicated with a `` c '' flag therein .",
    "thus we decided to keep all the c - flagged sources in our analysis since they could be useful for reference in future releases of _ fermi _  catalogs .      the 2fgl catalog[multiblock footnote omitted ] based on 24 months of _ fermi _  operation lists 1873 @xmath0-ray sources @xcite .",

    "* we also emphasize that the proposed classification depends on the availability of the optical spectroscopic information for the low - energy counterparts .",

    "* ) with a bl lac - like or a quasar - like * optical * spectrum available in literature ; 3 ) radio sources with a blazar - like optical spectrum available in literature ( i.e. , a published spectrum or a description of the features found in the near infrared  optical band ) and with a _ wise _  counterpart .    finally , we labelled as unclassified counterparts ( unc ) those sources satisfying at least one of the following criteria : 1 ) _ wise _  infrared colors similar to those of @xmath0-ray blazars selected according to the association methods developed by dabrusco et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and/or with the kernel density estimator analysis ( * ? ? ?",

    "all the remaining sources are still unidentified ( ugs ) .",
    "the proposed classification scheme has three main advantages .    1 .   to have a homogeneous classification of the blazars listed in our analysis and to avoid misclassifications we adopted the following criterion .",
    "we indicate as blazars only sources that were previously recognized and classified in the roma - bzcat .",
    "there are indeed several counterparts classified as bzb or bzq listed in the 1lac and in the 2lac catalogs that do not have the same classification according to the roma - bzcat   or for which no optical spectra were found in literature to confirm their classification .",
    "2 .   we do not classify a source with a radio and/or x - ray counterpart as an active galaxy of uncertain type ( agu ) since these requirements are not strictly sufficient to claim a source as an agn or as blazar - like and the lack of multifrequency information does not allow us to determine precisely its nature .",
    "consequently , we introduced the bcn and the unc classes .",
    "once optical spectra and multifrequency observations become available a refined classification will be provided .",
    "we introduced the sfr class for cases where _ fermi _  position is consistent with a known massive sfr for three reasons .",
    "first , to highlight the possibility that an unknown snr , pwn and/or psr is embedded therein , for which multifrequency observations are necessary to confirm their presence .",
    "second , because the use of this information could be adopted to refine @xmath0-ray diffuse models in future releases of the _ fermi _  catalogs . in particular ,",
    "the largest fraction of these sfr potential associations were determined using the recent _ wise _  catalog of galactic hii regions[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xcite , which was not available during the preparation of the currently - published _ fermi _  catalogs .",
    "this could also reveal new correspondences between the uncertainties of the diffuse @xmath0-ray background models and regions of interstellar medium in the galactic plane .",
    "third , this could be useful for future investigations of the environments of the galactic @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "finally , we remark that for the sources indicated as candidate associations and classified as sfrs , snrs , pwns and psrs we investigated the radio and infrared images available in the nvss , the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) galactic plane compact 327-mhz source catalog ( wsrtgp ; * ? ? ?",

    "two years after the release of the second _ fermi _  source catalog we present a comprehensive multifrequency investigation of all the @xmath0-ray associations listed in both the 1fgl and the 2fgl catalogs .",
    "first , we introduced a new category of @xmath0-ray source associations in addition to _ identified _ and _ associated _ sources .",
    "we label as _ candidate associations _ those @xmath0-ray sources having a potential low - energy counterpart of few specific classes of well - known @xmath0-ray emitters lying within the _ fermi _  positional uncertainty region and/or with angular separations between the _ fermi _  and the counterpart position smaller than the maximum one for all the associated sources of the same class .",
    "then we provided a new classification scheme for the low - energy counterparts of the _ fermi _  sources based on the multifrequency observations and on the optical spectroscopic information now available .",
    "we also presented here a cross - matching between the _ fermi _  catalogs and several surveys of sfrs ( see section  [ sec : crossmatches ] for details ) to highlight the possibility that an unknown snr , pwn and/or psr is embedded therein , and to provide information that could be used to refine models of diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray for future releases of the _ fermi _  catalogs .    the total number of @xmath0-ray sources considered in our investigation for both the 1fgl and the 2fgl comprises 2219 unique _ fermi _",
    "objects , all listed in table  [ tab : main ] with each assigned counterpart and their main multifrequency properties .",
    "overall , in the refined association list of the _ fermi _  catalogs , we found 174 _ fermi _  sources with a sfr consistent with their @xmath0-ray positions .",
    "in particular , 60 _ fermi _  objects out of these 174 do not have the `` c '' flag in at least one of the _ fermi _",
    "names and include : 13 identified sources , 17 associated , and 30 candidate associations .",
    "their counterparts are also classified as four hmbs ; 17 psrs , among which three lie in a pwn and two in a snr ; three pwne , one with a psr ; one radio galaxy ; thirteen snrs , two with a psr included ; one binary star ; three unclassified sources ; and 19 sfrs .",
    "we found spectroscopic information for 177 extragalactic @xmath0-ray sources not reported in the previous version of the _ fermi _  catalogs .",
    "we included analyses of eight new optical spectroscopic observations performed with the 2.1-meter telescope of the oan in san pedro mrtir and with the oagh to confirm the natures of these blazar - like sources found in our multifrequency investigation .",
    "blazar candidates and counterparts with unknown origin ( i.e. , unc ) were also analyzed with the kde technique to determine the fraction having _ wise _  ir colors similar to known @xmath0-ray blazars .",
    "we compared the refined associations listed in both the _ fermi _  catalogs with the classification proposed on the basis of statistical investigations @xcite and we found a good agreement with our results .",
    "we note that in the combined list of refined associations for 1fgl and 2fgl , among 2219 sources , 394 are still ugss ( i.e. , @xmath118% of the entire sample ) with 191 of them having no @xmath0-ray analysis flags .",
    "this clean sample of 191 ugss appears to have a uniform distribution in the sky with a small excess toward the galactic plane , as shown in figure  [ fig : skydistugs ] .",
    "moreover , we conclude that the fraction of _ fermi _  sources with plausible counterparts , combining identifications , associations and candidate associations , within their @xmath0-ray positional uncertainty regions , is @xmath180% and up to @xmath190% when considering sources with no @xmath0-ray analysis flags .",
    "finally , we remark that within the sample of 191 ugss that do not have any @xmath0-ray analysis flags are 40 sources ( listed in table  [ tab : special ] ) that do not have any nvss and/or sumss radio source within their positional uncertainty regions at 95% level of confidence . their all - sky distribution , separated into those lying in the nvss footprint ( i.e. , declination greater than @xmath1440 ) and the others observable from the southern hemisphere is shown in figure  [ fig : skynomatches ] .",
    "the excess in the subsample of those with declinations less than @xmath1440 , clearly visible in figure  [ fig : skynomatches ] , could be due to shallower coverage by sumss relative to the nvss catalog .",
    "-ray analysis flag .",
    "we show those lying in the nvss footprint ( i.e. , declination greater than @xmath1440 ) as black circles while the others in the southern hemisphere are indicated as orange circles.,width=359,height=257 ]    it is worth mentioning that for these 40 ugss the distributions of the @xmath0-ray spectral index and of the @xmath0-ray fluxes do not show any significant differences from those of bzqs and the bzbs ( see figure  [ fig : comparing ] ) .",
    "however it is intriguing that these ugss tend to be brighter than the bzb population in the gamma - rays .",
    "it is unlikely that this small ugs subsample is constituted by blazars since given their @xmath0-ray fluxes @xmath25 and assuming the typical radio-@xmath0-ray fluxes of the blazar population , the expected radio flux densities should be greater than @xmath1 50 mjy for a large fraction , well above the nvss and the sumss flux thresholds . on the other hand we also conclude that their steep values of @xmath0-ray spectral indices are not compatible with sources emitting via dark matter annihilation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> since their releases , many follow up observations of unidentified gamma - ray sources ( ugss ) were performed and new procedures to associate gamma - ray sources with potential counterparts at other wavelengths were developed . here </S>",
    "<S> we review and characterize all the associations as published in the 1fgl and 2fgl catalog on the basis of multifrequency archival observations . </S>",

    "<S> we introduce a new counterpart category of `` candidate associations '' and propose a refined classification for the candidate low - energy counterparts of the _ fermi _  sources . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the 1fgl - assigned counterparts with those listed in the 2fgl to determine which unassociated sources became associated in later releases of the _ fermi _  catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> we also search for potential counterparts to all the remaining unassociated _ fermi_sources . finally , we prepare a refined and merged list of all the associations of the 1fgl plus 2fgl catalogs that includes 2219 unique _ fermi _  objects . </S>",
    "<S> this is the most comprehensive and systematic study of all the associations collected for the @xmath0-ray sources available to date . </S>",
