    "non - perturbative phenomena related to tunneling are often encountered in quantum field theory .",
    "well known examples are false vacuum decay and instanton - like transitions ( the latter are accompanied by non - conservation of fermion quantum numbers ) .",
    "when these phenomena are governed by a small coupling constant they can generally be studied by semiclassical methods .",
    "this is certainly the case at low energy or in situations which involve large number of quanta in the initial state . at low energy , collision processes",
    "can be well described by a semiclassical approximation relying on the existence of classical euclidean time solutions to the equations of motion interpolating between initial and final states . in the examples mentioned above these",
    "are bounce  @xcite and instanton  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the probability of the process is then proportional to the exponent of the euclidean action of these solutions . as the action is inversely proportional to the ( small ) coupling constant , the processes",
    "are highly suppressed .",
    "the effect of low energy excitations in the initial state ( colliding particles ) gives only a pre - exponential factor and is inessential .",
    "the situation changes at high energy , namely , at energy of the order of the tunneling barrier height which separates initial and final states . in general",
    ", there exists a static unstable solution to the equations of motion that lies on top of the potential barrier  @xcite ( properly speaking , at a saddle point of the potential ) . in field theory",
    "this solution is often referred to as the `` sphaleron '' , a name which we will use throughout this paper .",
    "the minimum height of the barrier is precisely the sphaleron energy @xmath0 .",
    "naively , from the analogy with quantum mechanics of one degree of freedom , one would expect that at energy higher than the sphaleron energy the exponential suppression disappears .",
    "this is indeed what happens at finite temperature  @xcite , finite fermion density  @xcite , or in the presence of heavy fermions in the initial state  @xcite .",
    "but in high energy particle collisions this is not necessarily the case , due to the fact that the characteristic size of the sphaleron configuration is much larger than the wavelength of the incoming particles . at the same time",
    "the application of a semiclassical technique becomes problematic because the initial state no longer involves a large number of quanta .    as was first noted in refs .",
    "@xcite , at relatively low energy the corrections to the collision - induced tunneling rate can be calculated by perturbative expansion in the background of the instanton .",
    "further studies showed that the actual expansion parameter in most models , including electroweak theory , is @xmath1  @xcite and the total cross section of the induced tunneling has an exponential form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the small coupling constant and the function here stands for `` holy grail '' @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath4 is a series in fractional powers of @xmath1 ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "while the perturbation theory in @xmath1 is limited to small @xmath5 , the general exponential form of the total cross section implies that there might exist a semiclassical - type procedure which would allow , at least in principle , to calculate @xmath4 at @xmath6 .",
    "however , since the initial state of two highly energetic particles is not semiclassical , the standard semiclassical procedure does not apply and a suitable generalization is needed , which was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite and further developed in refs .",
    "the corresponding formalism reduces the calculation of the exponential suppression factor to a certain classical boundary value problem , whose analytical solution is not usually possible .",
    "this approach is based on the conjecture that , with exponential accuracy , the two - particle initial state can be substituted by a multiparticle one provided that the number of particles is not parametrically large ( although not proven rigorously , this conjecture was checked in several orders of perturbation theory in @xmath1 in gauge theory  @xcite and explicitly in quantum mechanics with two degrees of freedom  @xcite ) .",
    "the few - particle initial state , in turn , can be considered as a limiting case of a truly multiparticle one with the number of particles @xmath7 , when the parameter @xmath8 is sent to zero . for the multiparticle initial state",
    "the transition rate is explicitly semiclassical and has the form @xmath9 according to the above conjecture , the function @xmath4 , corresponding to the two - particle incoming state , is reproduced in the limit @xmath10 , @xmath11 therefore , albeit indirectly , the function @xmath4 is also calculable semiclassically .    within the semiclassical framework ,",
    "the function @xmath12 is determined by the action evaluated at a particular solution to the classical field equations  @xcite on a certain contour in complex time . in this formulation ,",
    "the problem , at least in principle , is amenable to a computational solution .",
    "namely , one has to solve the corresponding classical boundary value problem numerically and calculate the function @xmath12 , which then can be used to extract information about @xmath4 .",
    "the implementation of this technique is nevertheless highly non - trivial .",
    "the differential equations one encounters are partially of the hyperbolic type ( along the minkowskian parts of the time contour ) and partially of elliptic type ( along the euclidean part ) , which makes their numerical solution particularly challenging . in the electroweak theory ,",
    "additional difficulties arise from the need to deal with the large number of internal degrees of freedom , unphysical modes due to gauge invariance , and time translational symmetry which cause an unwelcome degeneracy in the numerical procedure used to find the semiclassical solutions .",
    "moreover , at high energy ( roughly , at energy higher than the sphaleron energy ) tunneling solutions , interpolating between vicinities of different vacua in finite time , cease to exist .",
    "this subtlety turned out to be a general problem in the description of tunneling in systems with many degrees of freedom , and it has to do with the nontrivial way tunneling occurs at high energy  the system prefers to create a state close to the sphaleron , which then decays into the correct vacuum . to find the corresponding suppression exponent numerically one has to use a properly regularized version of the boundary value problem , developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in a long program of investigations",
    "we have been able to gradually overcome all of these hurdles .",
    "preliminary results for energies below the sphaleron energy were reported in ref .",
    "now we are in a position of presenting what we are confident is the full solution to the numerical problem for a wide range of energy and incoming particle number , including energies above the sphaleron .",
    "the field configurations we analyse in this paper are restricted to be spherically symmetric in space .",
    "hence our results apply , strictly speaking , to s - wave scattering only .    in this paper we will concentrate on obtaining the suppression exponent for collision - induced tunneling in @xmath13 gauge model with the higgs mechanism , corresponding to the electroweak sector of the standard model at zero @xmath14 .",
    "the problem is particularly interesting because of the baryon number violation which accompanies such processes @xcite and the relatively low sphaleron energy @xmath15 .",
    "though computational limitations do not allow to reach literally zero value of the rescaled number of particles @xmath8 , corresponding to particle collisions , we were able to extrapolate the results to zero @xmath8 and get a bound on the suppression exponent ( strictly speaking , for s - wave scattering ) and also provide an estimate for this exponent .",

    "we give the derivation of the semiclassical method for the gauge model .",

    "non - abelian gauge models have an infinite number of topologically distinct vacua , labeled by an integer topological number .",
    "processes changing the topological number are accompanied by violation of fermion ( baryon and lepton ) numbers @xcite , a phenomenon of great interest for cosmology and particle physics .",
    "the topologically distinct vacua are separated by a potential barrier , whose height , in models with the higgs mechanism , is given by the sphaleron energy .",
    "topology changing transition may occur via tunneling at low energies or , at sufficiently high energy and suitable initial state , via classical evolution over the sphaleron .",
    "in this paper we study a four - dimensional model which captures all the important features of the standard model  an @xmath13 gauge theory with the higgs doublet .",
    "this model corresponds to the bosonic sector of the standard model with @xmath16 . to the leading order in the coupling constant",
    ", the effect of fermions on the gauge and higgs fields dynamics can be ignored  @xcite .",
    "the action of the model is @xmath17 where @xmath18 \\\\    { d_\\mu}\\phi     & = ( { \\partial_\\mu}-ia_\\mu)\\phi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "here we have eliminated inessential constants by an appropriate choice of units .",
    "the dimensional parameters can be restored noting that in the normalization , the gauge boson mass is @xmath21 and the higgs boson mass is @xmath22 in most of our calculations the higgs self - coupling @xmath23 was set equal to @xmath24 , which corresponds to @xmath25 .",
    "the dependence on the higgs boson mass is very weak , so this is a reasonable approximation .",
    "also we often omit the omnipresent overall factor @xmath26",
    ".    any vacuum configuration in this model can be obtained from the trivial vacuum @xmath27 , @xmath28 by a certain gauge transformation @xmath29 .",
    "we will be using the temporal gauge @xmath30 , where the vacuum configurations are described by time - independent @xmath31 , corresponding to residual gauge invariance . in this gauge , field values at spatial infinity can not change during the evolution ( otherwise the kinetic term becomes infinite ) and thus one considers only those @xmath31 which have some fixed asymptotics at spatial infinity .",
    "often the asymptotic @xmath32 is used , so any vacuum configuration corresponds to a mapping from space @xmath33 with identified infinity , which is homotopically equivalent to @xmath34 , to the gauge group @xmath35 .",
    "the degree of this mapping is precisely the topological number of the corresponding vacuum .",
    "a gauge choice of this form is convenient for analysis of the excitations about the trivial vacuum . for other purposes it may however be useful to choose an alternative behavior of the gauge function at spatial infinity , like @xmath36 , which maps the @xmath37 of spatial infinity to the equatorial @xmath37 of the @xmath13 .",
    "the two neighboring vacua then map the space @xmath33 either to north or south hemisphere of the @xmath13 .",
    "in this gauge , the sphaleron configuration takes the simplest form , and we will use this gauge everywhere in this paper , except for the analysis of the mode expansion in the initial state .",
    "numerous perturbative attempts were made to find the probability of the collision - induced topology changing transitions in this model ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) , giving reliable results only for relatively low energies . a non - perturbative study of classically allowed over - barrier transitions was presented in ref .",
    "all solutions found in ref .",
    "@xcite are configurations with large numbers of particles in the initial state and thus they do not correspond to realistic collisions .",

    "this method was implemented in ref .",

    "@xcite fails for energy above the sphaleron due to the problems one encounters as the energy approaches the height of the barrier in systems with many degrees of freedom .",
    "these problems were studied in detail in the context of a quantum mechanical model in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a regularization technique was suggested to overcome them .    the basic idea in the proposal of refs .",
    "@xcite is that , instead of a process with exclusive , two - particle initial state , one considers a topology changing process with inclusive initial state characterized by definite energy @xmath5 and incoming particle number @xmath38 .",
    "the transition probability @xmath39 can then be used to provide a bound on the exclusive two - particle cross - section , while the two - particle transition exponent is obtained in the limit @xmath40 .",
    ", for other @xmath41 the singularities generally move to larger @xmath42 . ]",
    "the inclusive probability of tunneling from a state with fixed energy and number of particles is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the @xmath45-matrix , @xmath46 are projectors onto subspaces of fixed energy @xmath5 and fixed number of particles @xmath38 , and the states @xmath47 and @xmath48 are perturbative excitations about topologically distinct vacua .",
    "this matrix element can be written in double path integral representation .",
    "for large @xmath49 and @xmath50 the path integral can be calculated in the semiclassical approximation , and this leads to the problem of solving the equations of motion of the system on a special contour in complex time plane , which detours around singularities , as shown in fig .  [ fig : time_contour ] .",
    "the presence of branch cut singularities can be inferred from the following argument .",
    "one notices that , for energy below the sphaleron energy , if one continues the solution along a line parallel to the real axis , be this via a forward integration of the equation of motion from the ab part of the contour or a backward integration from the cd part of the contour , the field must fall back to the original topological sector .",
    "on the other hand , by construction , on the ab and cd parts of the contour the solution must be in different topological sectors .",
    "thus the solution must also be in different topological sectors on the ab part of the contour and on the negative real axis and , likewise , on the positive real axis and the continuation of the ab segment to positive time .",
    "this may happen only if two branch cut singularities exist on the two sides of the bc part of the contour ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : time_contour ] ) .",
    "eventually the semiclassical approximation produces the following result ( @xmath51 here stands for all physical fields in the model ) , @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the action along the time contour , the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 are legendre conjugate to @xmath5 and @xmath38 ; the parameter @xmath54 is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_contour ] ; we will have to say more about @xmath55 later on . in what follows we will usually drop the tilde over the rescaled energy and incoming particle number , and the overall @xmath26 factor , restoring it only in the final results .",
    "the boundary term @xmath56 is written using frequency components @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the field on the part a of the contour : @xmath59 the field @xmath51 satisfies the field equation    [ final_bvp ] @xmath60 at initial time the frequency components of the solution should satisfy the following equation ( `` @xmath55 boundary condition '' ) @xmath61 for @xmath55 different from zero this equation implies that the field must be continued to complex values . for a complex field , like @xmath62 in  , its real and imaginary parts",
    "must be continued to complex values separately .",
    "on the final part of the contour ( cd ) , the field must satisfy the reality condition @xmath63    ( for complex fields , such as @xmath62 in , this means that both @xmath64 and @xmath65 must be real ) .",
    "equations  specify the boundary value problem corresponding to the induced topological transition .    the equations obtained by variation over the auxiliary parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 are @xmath66 these equations indirectly fix values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 for given energy and number of particles .",
    "alternatively , one can fix @xmath54 and @xmath55 , solve the boundary value problem and obtain the corresponding values of @xmath5 and @xmath38 using and .",
    "this is especially convenient in numerical calculations .",
    "the interpretation of the solutions to the boundary value problem ( [ final_bvp ] ) is as follows . on the part cd of the contour ,",
    "the saddle - point field is real asymptotically ; it describes the evolution of the system after tunneling . on the contrary",
    ", it follows from boundary conditions ( [ bvp_bc2 ] ) that in the initial asymptotic region the saddle - point field is complex whenever @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the initial state which maximizes the probability ( [ sigmafexp ] ) is not described by a real classical field , i.e.this stage of the evolution is essentially quantum even at @xmath68 .",
    "there is a subtle point concerning the boundary condition",
    ". it can be satisfied in two different ways .",
    "either the solution is exactly real on the whole cd part of the contour and is close to vacuum , or it has an exponentially decaying imaginary part and approaches the sphaleron along the complexified unstable direction .",
    "this subtlety is important for the analysis at high energies ( section  [ sec : reg ] ) , @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath38 plane . ]    the solutions to the boundary value problem can be found numerically for different values of @xmath5 and @xmath38 . in this paper",
    "we study solutions that have spherical symmetry in space .",
    "one expects that these are most important for large enough @xmath38 ; perturbative calculations about the instanton suggest that spatial spherical symmetry is relevant at relatively low energies and all @xmath38 .",
    "we do not have a convincing argument in favor of spherical symmetry for few particle collisions at very high energies ; in any case , our results as they stand , are valid for s - wave scattering .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that the @xmath69 plane is divided into several different regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] ) . values of @xmath70 are trivially excluded by kinematics .",
    "for relatively low energies ( region a ) the transitions between the topologically distinct vacua can occur only via tunneling . at the sphaleron energy @xmath0 the situation changes .",
    "a slight excitation of the sphaleron along the unstable direction gives origin to a solution of the classical equations of motion which evolves towards different topological sectors at large negative and positive times .",
    "since the sphaleron has exactly one negative mode , there is only one infinitesimal deformation of this type , and thus the corresponding solution has definite number of particles @xmath71 in the initial state . at higher energies one may add excitations of the positive modes above the sphaleron to obtain over - barrier solutions with different , and ,",
    "in particular , smaller initial particle number .",
    "these solutions belong to the domain of classically allowed transitions ( region b in fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] ) , where the topology changing processes are unsuppressed .",
    "the boundary between region a and region b corresponds to configurations staying for an infinite time close to the sphaleron ( since there are no bound states in the sphaleron background  @xcite , all excitations about the sphaleron fly away at finite time , so the field relaxes to the sphaleron solution ) .    in the classically forbidden region",
    "a there is a special family of solutions , corresponding to @xmath72 in the boundary value problem .",
    "these are represented by the line @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] . in this case , the boundary condition ( [ bvp_bc2 ] ) reduces to the reality condition imposed at @xmath74 .",
    "the solution to the resulting boundary value problem is the periodic instanton of ref .",

    "when analytically continued in the minkowskian direction through the turning points , the periodic instanton is real on the lines @xmath78 and @xmath79 and therefore satisfies the boundary value problem ( [ final_bvp ] ) with @xmath72 . like any other solution linearizing at large negative times at part a of the contour of fig .",
    "[ fig : time_contour ] , the periodic instanton has a certain number of incoming particles , eq .  .",
    "for given energy @xmath5 below the sphaleron , this number is such that the suppression exponent @xmath80 has a minimum , i.e. , the transition occurs at maximum rate .",
    "the classically forbidden region a is further subdivided into two regions .",
    "for low energies ( region a.i ) the system is close to the vacuum on the final part of the evolution , so the boundary condition leads to the exact reality of the fields on the part cd of the time contour . at energies higher than the sphaleron energy ( precisely , on the right of the line @xmath81 ) the system ends up close to the sphaleron ( with extra outgoing waves in the sphaleron background ) . in this case eq .",
    "is truly asymptotic .",
    "so , the system tunnels `` on top '' of the barrier , creating an unstable sphaleron configuration , which then decays with probability of order 1 to any of the two neighboring vacua .",
    "this situation is realized in the region a.ii .",
    "this new qualitative feature of the tunneling at high energies emerges from the existence of the bifurcation of the solutions and is not seen in any order of perturbative expansion around the instanton .",

    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "one introduces small but non - zero @xmath349 at energies below @xmath81 , then obtains solutions with proper topology for any energy .",

    "moreover , at the boundary of the classically allowed region , the solutions to the regularized problem merge smoothly with the classical over - barrier topology changing solutions , because the bifurcation on the boundary of the classically allowed domain is regularized exactly in the same way as the bifurcation at @xmath354 . at the boundary of the classically allowed region @xmath85 by definition , so the regularized version of this functional @xmath355 is proportional to @xmath349 .",
