    "to get a taste of the type of problem considered in ramsey theory , consider an arbitrary gathering of @xmath5 people . one might wonder whether there is a group of @xmath6 people at the party who are all mutual acquaintances , or a group of @xmath7 people who are all mutual strangers .",
    "using ramsey theory @xcite it can be shown that once the party size @xmath5 reaches a threshold size @xmath8 , _ every _ party with @xmath9 people _ must _ contain either @xmath6 mutual acquaintances or @xmath7 mutual strangers .",

    "each party - goer is identified with a vertex , and a red ( blue ) edge is drawn between a pair of vertices when the corresponding people are acquaintances ( strangers ) . since any two people attending will either know each other or not , every pair of vertices is joined by a red or blue edge .",

    "the ramsey theory result for the party problem becomes a theorem in graph theory @xcite : if the order @xmath5 of the complete graph @xmath10 satisfies @xmath9 , then every red / blue coloring of the edges of @xmath10 contains either a red @xmath11 or a blue @xmath12 subgraph .",
    "the classical two - color ramsey numbers @xmath8 are extremely difficult to calculate , with only @xmath13 values currently known @xcite .",
