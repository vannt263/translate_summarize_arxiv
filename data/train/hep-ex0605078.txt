    "besii  @xcite running at bepc and cleoc  @xcite running at cesr are the two detectors operating in the @xmath7-charm energy region .",
    "both experiments have collected large data samples of charmonium decays including 58  m @xmath0 events , 14  m @xmath1 events , and 33  pb@xmath8 data around @xmath2 peak at besii , and 4  m @xmath1 events , and 281  pb@xmath8 @xmath2 events at cleoc . to study the continuum background in",
    "the charmonium decays , special data samples at the center of mass energy lower than the @xmath1 mass were taken both at besii ( @xmath9  gev ) and at cleoc ( @xmath10  gev ) , the luminosities are 6.4  pb@xmath8 and 21  pb@xmath8 respectively .",
    "these data samples are used for the study of the hadron spectroscopy , the @xmath11 decay properties and the ckm matrix , as well as the charmonium decay dynamics .    in this paper , we focus on the the extensive study of the `` @xmath12 puzzle '' in @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays , the relative phase between strong and electromagnetic amplitudes of @xmath1 decays , and the non-@xmath5 decays of @xmath2 . the study of @xmath6 decays are also reviewed .    it should be noted that performance of the cleoc detector is much better than the besii detector , especially in the photon detection , this makes the 4  m @xmath1 events data sample at cleoc produces results with similar precision as from 14  m @xmath1 events from besii .",
    "it has been determined that for many two - body exclusive @xmath0 decays , like vector pseudoscalar ( vp ) , vector vector ( vv ) , and pseudoscalar pseudoscalar ( pp ) meson decays and nucleon anti - nucleon ( n@xmath13 ) decays , the relative phases between the three - gluon and the one - photon annihilation amplitudes are near @xmath14  @xcite . for @xmath1 decays , the available information about the phase is much more limited because there are fewer experimental measurements .",
    "it has been argued that the relative phases in @xmath1 decays should be similar to those in @xmath0 decays  @xcite , but the analysis of @xmath1 to vp decays in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates this phase is likely to be around @xmath15 .",
    "another analysis of this mode though shows the relative phase observed in @xmath0 decays could also fit these decays  @xcite , but it could not rule out the @xmath15 possibility due to the big uncertainties in the experimental data .",
    "bes measured the branching fraction of @xmath16  @xcite to be @xmath17 , together with the known branching fractions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , two possible solutions of the phase are found , which is either @xmath20 or @xmath21 , following the procedure developed in ref .",
    "benefits from the good detector performance , cleo measures all three pseudoscalar meson pair decay modes  @xcite .",
    "the branching fraction of @xmath16 is @xmath22 , that of @xmath19 is @xmath23 ; the signal of @xmath18 is not significant , and the upper limit of the branching fraction is determined to be @xmath24 at 90% c.l .",
    "cleo measures the relative phase to be @xmath25 , assuming there is no interference between continuum amplitude and the resonance decay amplitudes , which is questionable since the two components of the resonance decays has a relative phase around @xmath14 , as measured by both besii and cleoc experiments .",
    "following the same procedure developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , cleo measurements also result in two solutions for the phase , one at around @xmath26 degrees , while another at around @xmath27 degrees , in good agreement with the bes result .",
    "the error is large due to the small statistics of the data samples , and there is no way to determine which solution is the physical one .",
    "from perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , it is expected that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 decaying into light hadrons are dominated by the annihilation of @xmath28 into three gluons or one virtual photon , with a width proportional to the square of the wave function at the origin  @xcite .",
    "this yields the pqcd `` 12% rule '' , @xmath29 a large violation of this rule was first observed in decays to @xmath12 and @xmath30 by mark  ii  @xcite , known as _",
    "the @xmath12 puzzle _ , where only the upper limits on the branching fractions were reported in @xmath1 decays .",
    "since then , many two - body decay modes of the @xmath1 have been measured by the bes collaboration and recently by the cleo collaboration ; some decays obey the rule while others violate it  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 mode of the vector charmonia decays is essential for this study , since this is the first puzzling channel found in @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays .",
    "the new measurements , together with the old information , show us a new picture of the charmonium decay dynamics .",
    "besii measured the @xmath32 branching fraction using its @xmath0 and @xmath33 data samples  @xcite , and babar measured the same branching fraction using @xmath0 events produced by initial state radiative ( isr ) events at @xmath34  gev  @xcite . together with the measurement from mark - ii  @xcite",
    ", we get a weighted average of @xmath35 .    to extract the @xmath36 branching fraction , partial wave analysis ( pwa ) is needed to consider the possible contribution from the excited @xmath37 states , the only available information on the fraction of @xmath12 in @xmath38 was got from mark - iii . using the information given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate @xmath39 , with the error from an educated guess based on the information in the paper since we have no access to the covariant matrix from the fit showed in the paper . from this number and @xmath40 got above , we estimate @xmath41 .",
    "this is substantially larger than the world average listed by pdg  @xcite , which is @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath44 was studied both at besii  @xcite and cleoc  @xcite . after selecting two charged pions and two photons , clear @xmath45 signals",
    "are observed in the two photon invariant mass spectra , the numbers of signals are found to be 229 and 196 from besii and cleoc respectively , and the branching fraction of @xmath46 is measured to be @xmath47 and @xmath48 at besii and cleoc respectively .",
    "the two experiments give results in good agreement with each other .",
    "to extract the branching fraction of @xmath44 , however , besii uses a pwa including the high mass @xmath37 states and the interference between them , while cleoc counts the number of events by applying a @xmath37 mass cut .",
    "the branching fraction from besii is @xmath49 , while that from cleoc is @xmath50 , the difference is large .",
    "although a big difference exists between the besii and cleoc results , it does mean that the @xmath44 signal exists , rather than the signal is completely missing as has been guessed before .",
    "if we take a weighted average neglecting the difference between the two measurements , we get @xmath51 .    comparing @xmath52 with @xmath53 , one gets @xmath54 the suppression compared to the 12% rule is obvious .",
    "there are many more new measurements on @xmath1 decays for the extensive study of the 12% rule  @xcite , among which the vp modes are measured as first priority .",
    "the ratios of the branching fractions are suppressed for almost all these vp modes compared with the 12% rule ; while the pp modes , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , are enhanced compared with the 12% rule .",
    "the multi - hadron modes and the baryon - antibaryon modes are either suppressed , or enhanced , or normal , which are very hard to be categorized simply .",
    "the various models , developed for interpreting specific mode can hardly find solution for all these newly observed modes .",
    "one observation is that many of the attempts to interpret the @xmath4 puzzle are based on the potential models for the charmonium which were developed more than 20 years ago , as the b - factories discovered many new charmonium states  @xcite which are hard to be explained in the potential models , it may indicate even the properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not as expected from the potential models .",
    "the further understanding of the other high mass charmonium states may shed light on the understanding of the low lying ones .",
    "since @xmath2 is above the @xmath5 threshold , it decays predominantly into charmed mesons , however , since the old measurements may indicate big contribution of @xmath2 charmless decays  @xcite , and large fraction of charmless decays of @xmath2 is expected if @xmath2 is a mixture of @xmath57- and @xmath11-wave charmonium states and the mixing is responsible for the 12% rule violation in @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays  @xcite , both besii and cleoc experiments tried to search for the non-@xmath5 decays of @xmath2 in both exclusive modes and inclusive measurement .",
    "it has been pointed out that the continuum amplitude plays an important role in measuring @xmath2 decays into light hadrons  @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are two issues which need to be clarified in @xmath2 decays , that is whether @xmath2 decays into light hadrons really exist , and if it exists , how large is it .",
    "the searches for the non-@xmath5 decays are performed by comparing the cross sections on and off the @xmath2 resonance peak .      by comparing the cross sections of @xmath59 at the @xmath2 resonance peak ( @xmath60  gev ) and at a continuum energy point ( @xmath9  gev at besii and @xmath61  gev at cleoc ) below the @xmath1 peak",
    ", both besii and cleoc found that @xmath62 at continuum is larger than that at @xmath2 resonance peak .",
    "the average of the two experiments  @xcite are @xmath63 @xmath64 the difference , after considering the form factor variation between 3.650 and 3.773  gev , is still significant , and it indicates that there is an amplitude from @xmath2 decays which interferes destructively with the continuum amplitude , and makes the cross section at the @xmath2 peak smaller than the pure contribution of continuum process .    for the @xmath12 mode , besii can only give upper limit of its cross section due to the limited statistics of the data sample , the upper limit at 90% c. l. is found to be 6.0  pb  @xcite at the @xmath2 peak , which is in consistent with the measurement from cleoc using a much larger data sample : @xmath65  @xcite ; while the cross section at the continuum is @xmath66  pb measured by cleoc .    to extract the information on the @xmath67 branching fraction , besii developed a method based on the measured cross sections at @xmath2 resonance peak and at the continuum  @xcite . by neglecting the electromagnetic decay amplitude of @xmath2 ,",
    "there are two amplitudes which contribute to the cross section at the @xmath2 peak , the strong decay amplitude of @xmath2 and the continuum amplitude .",
    "taking the continuum amplitude as a real number , the @xmath2 strong decay amplitude is described as one real number for the magnitude , and one phase between @xmath2 strong and electromagnetic decays to describe the relative phase between the two amplitudes . since",
    "only two measurements are available ( at @xmath2 peak and at continuum ) , one can only extract @xmath2 decay branching fraction as a function of the relative phase .",
    "besii measurement on the upper limit of the @xmath68 cross section at @xmath2 peak , together with the cleoc measurement of the continuum cross section restrict the physics region of the branching fraction and the relative phase as shown in fig .",
    "[ besii_pspp ] . from the figure",
    ", we see that the branching fraction of @xmath67 is restricted within @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and the phase is between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , at 90% c.l .",
    "the observation of the @xmath68 signal at @xmath2 peak and the measurement of the cross section  @xcite at cleoc further make the physical region in the branching ratio and relative phase plane smaller : the cleoc measurement gives a similar outer bound of the physical region as bes gives , while also indicates the central part of the physical region in fig .",
    "[ besii_pspp ] is not allowed by physics . by using a toy monte carlo to simulate the cleoc selection criteria and the interference between the resonance and continuum amplitudes",
    ", we found that the @xmath67 branching fraction could be either @xmath73 or @xmath74 from the cleoc measurements , if the relative phase between @xmath2 strong and electromagnetic decay amplitudes is @xmath75 as observed in @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 decays into light hadrons were searched for in various @xmath2 decay modes , including two - bady and multi - hadron modes  @xcite .",
    "however , only the comparison between the cross sections at continuum and those at @xmath2 resonance peak are given , instead of giving the @xmath2 decay branching fractions . in current circumstances",
    ", it is still not clear whether the @xmath2 decays into light hadrons with large branching fractions , since , as has been shown in the @xmath12 case , there could be two solutions for the branching fraction , and the two values could be very different .",
    "as the luminosity at the @xmath2 peak is large enough , current study is limited by the low statistics at the continuum : at cleoc , the luminosity at continuum is more than an order of magnitude smaller than that at peak , this prevents from a high precision comparison between the cross sections at the two energy points .",
    "one conclusion we can draw from the existing data is that the measurements do not contradict with the assumption that the relative phase between @xmath2 strong and electromagnetic decay amplitudes is around @xmath75 , and the @xmath2 decays into light hadrons could be large .",
    "the inclusive non-@xmath5 decays of @xmath2 is searched for by measuring the @xmath5 cross section and the total hadronic cross section above the @xmath76 continuum contribution at the @xmath2 resonance peak .",
    "bes and cleo measure the @xmath5 cross section  @xcite using both single tag and double tag methods , the results are shown in fig .",
    "good agreement between bes and cleo on the @xmath77 and @xmath78 , as well as the total @xmath5 cross sections are found .",
    "the weighted average of the two experiments is @xmath79  nb for the total @xmath5 cross section .",
    "the total hadronic cross section of @xmath2 decay is obtained by comparing the cross sections at the @xmath2 peak and the data points below the resonance peak .",
    "the contributions of the radiative tails of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are also subtracted . by comparing this cross section and the @xmath5 cross section , bes found a non-@xmath5 decay branching fraction of @xmath80  @xcite , while cleo measured the non-@xmath5 cross section of @xmath81  nb  @xcite , which corresponds to an upper limit of the non-@xmath5 decay branching fraction of 11% at 90% c. l.    although the bes and cleo measurements are not in contradiction considering the large uncertainties , the big difference between the two central values calls for a better understanding of the procedure from which the total inclusive cross section is obtained .",
    "an obvious difference between the two measurements is how to consider the interference between the resonance and the continuum amplitudes .",
    "since each @xmath6 ( @xmath82 ) is produced about 10% of the @xmath1 decays , they are studied at bes to understand the p - wave charmonium decay dynamics , as well as the light hadron spectroscopy .",
    "two modes , @xmath84  @xcite and @xmath85 , were measured recently , while the former is the first observation , the latter improves the precision .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ vv ] , together with the measurement of @xmath86  @xcite .",
    "these results are used to predict the decay branching fractions of @xmath6 to other vector meson pairs , like @xmath87 and @xmath88  @xcite , large double ozi suppressed amplitude is expected .",
    ".branching fractions of @xmath89 vv ( in @xmath90 ) , the results on @xmath85 are bes preliminary . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the above results supply important information on the understanding of the natures of the scalar states  @xcite , as well as the decay dynamics of @xmath6 decays into pair of scalar particles .",
    "there are many new results in charmonium decays from besii and cleoc experiments .",
    "the decay properties of the vector charmonium states have been studied for more than three decades , but they are still far from being understood , one extreme example is the `` @xmath12 puzzle '' in @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays .",
