    "theoretical calculations within fixed - order perturbation theory allow for accurate predictions of inclusive observables like total cross sections .",
    "the analysis and interpretation of experimental signatures at the lhc , however , require theoretical predictions for exclusive final states , i.e.  predictions for differential distributions or cross sections with cuts on kinematic variables .",
    "higher - order calculations for such exclusive final states involve in general large corrections from soft or collinear parton emission , which need to be summed to all orders . an efficient way to achieve such a summation is through a parton shower .",
    "parton showers typically include the leading logarithmic contributions from soft and collinear gluon or quark emission to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "they form a central part of monte carlo event generators and are thus essential to connect theoretical models with realistic experimental signatures . on the other hand , standard parton shower event generators often rely on leading - order expressions for the hard scattering processes and",
    "can therefore not predict inclusive cross sections accurately .",
    "a central goal of recent and current theoretical work in lhc phenomenology is thus the automated calculation of next - to - leading ( nlo ) lhc cross sections including the summation of large corrections from multiple quark and gluon emission through parton showers .",
    "such a calculation should combine the accuracy of nlo predictions for inclusive cross sections with the power of parton shower monte carlo programs to reliably describe differential distributions and cross sections with cuts on kinematic variables .",
    "a naive combination of nlo calculations with parton showers would , however , lead to double counting of higher - order contributions that are included in both the nlo cross section and the parton shower .",
    "these contributions have to be identified and subtracted from the calculation by means of a matching procedure .",
    "much work in recent years has been devoted to the formulation of matching schemes that allow for a consistent combination of parton showers and nlo calculations including loop - corrections  @xcite .",
    "so far , however , only few publicly available computer codes exist that implement such schemes , including in particular mc@nlo  @xcite , powheg  @xcite , sherpa  @xcite and madgraph5_amc@nlo  @xcite . the problem of double counting contributions that are included in both the nlo calculation and the parton shower has been solved in all approaches in a similar way : the parton shower evolution is generically described by a sudakov factor of the form @xmath0 shown here for gluon emission off a quark with virtuality @xmath1 . in the collinear limit @xmath2 the function @xmath3 reduces to the altarelli - parisi splitting function .",
    "the sudakov factor includes short - distance contributions which are also part of the nlo cross section and which can be identified by expanding the exponential in powers of @xmath4 . when combining parton showers with nlo calculations these contributions need to be subtracted to avoid double counting .",
    "early work by many authors has focused on implementing specific processes into the mc@nlo program and within the powheg framework .",
    "while the original mc@nlo code is very successful and now includes a large number of processes , it is tied strongly to the parton shower of herwig ( both herwig6 and herwig++ ) .",
    "this restriction has been lifted recently within madgraph5_amc@nlo , which is not only fully automatic , but also parton shower independent and may be used with various versions of herwig and pythia .",
    "we note that sherpa contains an implementation of mc@nlo as well .",
    "powheg , on the other hand , allowed for matching with a generic parton shower from the beginning and could thus be interfaced with various monte carlo programs . in practice",
    ", the implementation of specific processes has been greatly simplified thanks to the powheg - box tool . in each of the frameworks ,",
    "multiple parton emission is summed at the leading - logarithmic ( ll ) level only ( although leading - color subleading logarithmic effects might be included in parton showers based on nlo subtraction schemes , such as the catani - seymour subtraction ) , and the results can thus not compete with the accuracy of dedicated resummation calculations which are routinely performed at next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy ( nll ) .",
    "the formulation and improvement of parton showers , which are in general based on various assumptions and approximations , has also been addressed by various authors recently  @xcite .",
    "notably , refs.@xcite have proposed a parton shower that includes quantum interference , spin correlations and sub - leading color effects .",
    "interference is treated in standard parton showers only approximately by means of angular ordering , while spin information is generally ignored completely .",
    "spin correlations , on the other hand , are crucial for example to explore new physics models in cascade decays at the lhc . while refs.@xcite describe the theoretical formulation of parton showers with quantum interference , the first implementation  @xcite so far is based on the standard spin - averaged and leading - color treatment of parton splitting only",
    ".    the set - up of the parton shower also has implications for the matching with nlo calculations . if the splitting functions of the parton shower , @xmath5 , and the momentum mapping follow closely the definition of the subtraction terms used to regularize the soft and collinear divergences in the nlo calculation , then the matching is simplified considerably . with that in mind ,",
    "various authors have formulated parton showers that are based on commonly used subtraction schemes  @xcite .    to improve on existing nlo plus parton shower implementations , quantum interference contributions , spin correlations and sub - leading color effects in the parton shower",
    "should be included systematically .",
    "ultimately , one would like to develop a fast and numerically robust code for the automated calculation of multi - parton lhc cross sections at next - to - leading order , including the summation of next - to - leading logarithmic corrections through combination with parton showers . in this contribution",
    "we shall describe recent progress towards this goal .",
    "the article is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : subtraction ] we shall describe the construction of a nlo subtraction scheme as derived from a nll parton shower , and its implementation into the program package helac - nlo . section  [ sec : bbbb ] reports on the application of such a scheme for the automated calculation of nlo - qcd corrections to the production of four bottom quarks at the lhc .",
    "section  [ sec : nll_shower ] finally discusses progress towards developing and implementing a nll parton shower and the matching with helac - nlo .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the following , a new subtraction scheme based on a parton shower introduced by nagy and soper  @xcite is described .",
    "this new subtraction has been implemented in the publicly available helac - dipoles software @xcite and has already been tested in the calculation of the nlo qcd corrections to @xmath6 production at the lhc ( see the next section for more details ) . our main motivation , however , was to provide a framework for a simple matching between a fixed - order calculation and the new parton shower .",
    "however , before addressing this issue , the problem of the integration of subtraction terms over the unresolved phase space needed to be solved .",
    "this is the non - trivial part of any subtraction scheme .",
    "contrary to the usual practice at nlo , we did not perform involved analytic integrations , but rather used a semi - numerical approach . after a suitable parameterization , numerical integrations , inspired by recent nnlo methods @xcite ,",
    "have been performed .",
    "this has allowed us to cover both massless and massive cases with comparable effort .",
    "let us emphasize that our semi - numerical approach distinguishes our work from earlier publications on the subject presented e.g.   in refs.@xcite .",
    "let us start with the inclusive nlo qcd cross section for a generic process involving @xmath7 final - state qcd partons with momenta @xmath8 , which can be written as follows @xmath9 where @xmath10 @xmath11\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 describe the born , one - loop and real - emission matrix elements , respectively . the integration measure for the @xmath15 and the @xmath16parton phase space is denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , whereas @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the jet functions .    for @xmath21 well separated hard jets ,",
    "the born contribution is finite , whereas the virtual and the real - emission terms are individually divergent due to the presence of soft and collinear singularities . for an infrared - safe definition of partonic jets , all soft and collinear divergencies that affect the virtual and real corrections should cancel for the inclusive cross section , except for the singularities arising from the emission of nearly - collinear partons off the initial state , which are absorbed into a re - definition of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "this absorption is achieved by introducing suitable collinear counterterms , @xmath22 .",
    "however , the individual pieces , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , still suffer from soft and collinear divergencies and can not be integrated numerically in four dimensions . to solve this problem , local counterterms , @xmath25 , that are designed to match the singular structure of the integrand in the soft and collinear limits ,",
    "can be introduced : @xmath26 @xmath27\\ ] ] @xmath28 @xmath29 \\ , f_{m } \\,.\\ ] ] they are defined on the @xmath30-parton phase space , denoted @xmath31 and are subtracted from @xmath32 and added back to @xmath33 after integration over the phase space of the unresolved parton .",
    "this procedure , called subtraction method , makes the integrals individually convergent and thus well suited for a monte carlo integration .",
    "the construction of the local counterterms is inspired by the well known property of the universal factorization of qcd amplitudes in the soft and collinear limits .",
    "the singular structure of an @xmath30-parton squared amplitude for two partons @xmath34 and @xmath35 that become collinear can be expressed as follows : @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an amplitude for @xmath21 on - shell external partons , @xmath39 is an operator acting on the spin part of the amplitude and @xmath40 describes the reduced @xmath21-parton kinematics in the limit where partons @xmath34 and @xmath35 become collinear .",
    "the structure of the real - emission contribution can therefore be reduced to the product of a finite born amplitude squared times a divergent , collinear splitting kernel @xmath41 associated with the splitting @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes spin correlations .",
    "when a parton @xmath35 becomes soft , on the other hand , factorization can be written in the following form : @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 are operators acting on the color part of the amplitude and @xmath49 is the soft limit of the kinematical configuration @xmath31 . in the limit where @xmath50 , one can write the real - emission contribution as @xmath51 where the factorization is expressed in terms of @xmath21 soft splitting kernels @xmath52 , one for each external parton , and the symbol @xmath44 denotes color correlations .",
    "factorization properties described so far dictate general rules for constructing local counterterms for a given subtraction method . in the first step , a complete set of transformations , which map the original @xmath7 partons phase space , @xmath31 , into a new one , @xmath53 , that describes @xmath21 on - shell partons , needs to be defined .",
    "subsequently , a set of splitting functions @xmath54 , matching the behavior of the soft and collinear kernels in the singular limits , needs to be worked out .",
    "consequently , the local counterterms take the general form : @xmath55    there is a freedom in defining both mappings and splitting functions away from the singular limits , each choice leading to a different subtraction scheme .",
    "the most widespread version is the so - called catani - seymour scheme ( cs ) @xcite , where the local counterterms take the following form : @xmath56 here , each mapping @xmath57 is labeled by three parton indices . for a large number , @xmath21 , of external partons",
    ", the number of mappings and matrix elements required by the calculation scales cubically : @xmath58 . for our new nagy - soper subtraction scheme ( ns ) , on the other hand , we can write @xmath59 @xmath60 therefore , each mapping is characterized by two labels @xmath61 only , which implies that @xmath62 , i.e.   the number of mappings and subsequent matrix element evaluations is reduced by a factor @xmath21 compared to the catani - seymour case .",
    "our particular choice of the mapping and a form of splitting functions for the nagy - soper subtraction scheme can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us only mention that the latter are based on the original matrix elements for @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "let us also add here that the general structure of the real - emission contribution to @xmath66 in this scheme takes the following form : @xmath67 @xmath68\\ ] ] @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 f_{m } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73/@xmath74 correspond to the integrated subtraction terms .",
    "more precisely @xmath72 encodes the full soft / collinear structure of the matrix element in the form of single and double poles in @xmath75 , with @xmath76 the number of space - time dimensions , together with a finite part .",
    "the @xmath73/@xmath74 operator consists of purely finite pieces coming from the initial - state splitting ( @xmath73 ) as well as from the collinear counterterms ( @xmath74 ) and involves an additional integration over the momentum fraction @xmath77 of an incoming parton after splitting .",
    "an important feature of the nagy - soper mapping , that we would like to emphasize , is a change of all spectator momenta at the same time .",
    "this fact impacts the way the factorization of the phase space is performed .",
    "while in the case of initial - state emission there are no substantial differences with respect to the catani - seymour scheme , the factorization is derived in a slightly different way when the splitting occurs in the final state .",
    "the lorentz invariant phase space for a generic final state with @xmath7 partons is organized in terms of recursive splittings @xmath78 @xmath79",
    "@xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath83 and k is the so - called collective spectator momentum that is built by all spectator momenta @xmath84 moreover @xmath85 the masses of the on - shell final - state partons are denoted by @xmath86 , while @xmath87 is the invariant mass of the collective spectator",
    ". one can observe that @xmath88 which follows from the fact that the mapping @xmath89 is a lorentz transformation , and the phase space is lorentz invariant . in the frame where the total momentum @xmath90 is at rest",
    ", the two - body phase space can be parameterized in terms of angular variables , @xmath91 where @xmath92 represents the solid angle in @xmath76 dimensions and @xmath93 is the standard kllen function , @xmath94 when the total momentum @xmath90 is at rest , the integral @xmath95 for the two phase space elements @xmath96 and @xmath97 is the same .",
    "this implies that the jacobian related to the mapping @xmath98 is given by @xmath99 the phase space for the final - state emission can therefore be written in the fully factorized form @xmath78 @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the measure of the splitting phase space in @xmath76 dimensions .",
    "the parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 are uniquely fixed by setting @xmath104 and are given by @xmath105 therefore , in the singular limit one would simply have @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .    .",
    "here @xmath110 is the spectator parton selected to define the azimuthal variable @xmath111.__,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the phase space of the splitting has three degrees of freedom in @xmath112 dimensions . one possible way of parameterization is to use lorentz - covariant scalar products and splitting variables as proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "this simple choice results in compact formulae of the integrated dipoles for massless partons @xcite . applying the same strategy to the fully massive case , however , the kinematical bounds of the splitting become much more complicated and the resulting expressions turn out to be very cumbersome . to keep the final expressions reasonably compact ,",
    "we have adopted an alternative parameterization .",
    "for example , in the case of the final - state emission , for a set of momenta @xmath113 the splitting @xmath114 and the set of momenta @xmath31 had to be constructed out of three parameters that we have called collinear , soft and azimuthal variables . in the singular limit ,",
    "where @xmath115 , the collinear and the soft variables have to correspond to the relative angle between the nearly - collinear partons , @xmath116 , and the energy of the unresolved parton , @xmath117 . on the other hand , the azimuthal variable , @xmath111 , which is the second angular parameter uniquely fixes the kinematics of the splitting .",
    "our reference frame consists of an orthogonal set of axes @xmath118 , where the @xmath119-axis is identified with the spatial direction of the vector @xmath120 , as shown in figure[fig : angles_fin ] .",
    "the azimuthal variable is then the angle , which separates the unresolved parton @xmath35 from the the @xmath77-@xmath119 plane .",
    "since there is complete freedom in selecting the direction of the @xmath77-axis , we have decided to place it in the plane @xmath120-@xmath110 , where @xmath110 is the momentum of the spectator . in the frame , where the total momentum @xmath90 is at rest , the definition of the soft variable is as follows : @xmath121 it is convenient to divide this soft variable by its kinematically allowed maximum value to get a normalized soft variable @xmath122 : @xmath123 the integration of the splitting phase space in case of the final - state emission runs over the variables @xmath124 \\;,\\ ] ] @xmath125 \\,,\\ ] ] @xmath126 \\;.\\ ] ] the soft and collinear limits correspond to @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively .    for the calculation of the integrated subtraction terms in the nagy - soper scheme , we have adopted the spin - averaged version of the splitting functions as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "our goal is the integration in @xmath129 dimensions over the whole phase space of the splitting .",
    "however , as a consequence of the increased complexity of the mapping , a fully analytic evaluation of the integrals turns out to be demanding .",
    "thus , as an alternative we have used numerical approaches to integrate over the splitting phase space .",
    "more precisely , we have decided to adopt a semi - numerical approach to consider analytic integration when possible , and monte carlo integration otherwise .",
    "since the general dependence of the integrands on the azimuthal variable @xmath130 was simple and all the azimuthal integrals could be classified into three groups , we carried out this part of the integration analytically .",
    "the dependence on the soft and collinear variables was not as simple and led to more complicated expressions that we treated numerically .",
    "further details can be found in the original publication @xcite .",
    "we have incorporated the new subtraction method based on the nagy - soper formalism into the helac - dipoles package , preserving at the same time all the optimizations already available in the code . for a detailed description of the package functionalities ,",
    "we refer to the existing literature @xcite .",
    "all elements of the calculation that do not dependent on a specific subtraction scheme , like the born matrix elements and the color correlators , were already provided by the framework of helac - dipoles .",
    "this fact has dramatically simplified our implementation .",
    "the construction of the nagy - soper subtraction terms is dictated by the form of the splitting functions .",
    "they contain generic spinors and polarization vectors , which enables them to treat simultaneously fixed helicities as well as random polarization states .",
    "we have provided random polarization sampling as a further option available for the nagy - soper scheme .",
    "this is an alternative to the existing random helicity sampling optimization , which uses stratified sampling over the different ( incoherent ) helicity assignments of partons @xcite .",
    "the option for the spin sum treatment can be controlled by the user in the configuration file ` dipoles.conf ` as described in the appendix of ref.@xcite .",
    "besides random polarization sampling , which is an important speedup in every calculation , we have also provided random sampling over color , or color monte carlo , for the subtracted real radiation part . this functionality has provided an important speedup for matrix elements with a large number of colored external states .",

    "we have presented a subtraction scheme based on a parton shower with quantum interference and its implementation into the helac - nlo software .",
    "the new subtraction scheme has been applied to a number of challenging processes , including the production of up to four heavy quarks at the lhc .",
