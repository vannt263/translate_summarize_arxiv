    "the transitions between atomic internal states induced by resonant laser field is always accompanied by momentum transfer from photons to atoms .",
    "many elements of atom optics , e.g. deflectors and splitters , are based on this effect @xcite .",
    "these elements separate the atomic wave function into several components with different momentum @xcite- @xcite .",
    "a common approach for implementing such elements is to apply laser pulses with suitable temporal pulse areas ( e.g. so called @xmath0 or @xmath1 pulses ) .",
    "this technique , however , is not robust because it requires a carefully controlled duration and power of the pulse in order to assure * *  * * the desired area . an important paper by marte , zoller and hall @xcite showed that an atomic - beam deflection by the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) technique @xcite can be implemented via stimulated raman transitions induced by counterpropagating * *  * * laser beams . later on this idea was demonstrated independently by lawall et al .",
    "@xcite and goldner et al . @xcite .",
    "those publications stimulated the recognition of stirap , which was initially developed for efficient excitation of molecules .",
    "later , theuer et al .",
    "@xcite developed a laser controlled variable beam - splitter based on the tripod - stirap scheme @xcite , by varying the spatial overlap of lasers .",
    "for more details concerning current theoretical , experimental developments and applications of stirap , the interested readers are referred to the review articles @xcite . for completeness",
    ", however , we give a brief description of stirap .",
    "the underlying physical mechanism of stirap is the existence of an adiabatically decoupled , or dark state @xcite , which at early times coincides with the initial state  and at late times is aligned with the target state .",
    "when the pump and stokes frequencies together maintain two - photon resonance , then the only conditions to be fulfilled for successful transfer are those of adiabaticity @xcite,@xcite , i.e. large pulse area , and counterintuitive application of the pulses , i.e. stokes before pump .",
    "the schemes suggested in refs . @xcite and @xcite operate in the regime where doppler shifts of atomic transition frequencies due to the photon recoil and the recoil energy are small compared to the rabi * *  * * frequencies and the transit - time broadening . in this limit",
    "the combined system of atom plus fields is equivalent to a lambda or tripod atomic system in which internal states can be labeled by different photon recoil momenta .",
    "the idea of the beam splitters is then very clear : a population transfer between these internal states via stirap @xcite or via tripod - stirap @xcite necessarily means photon - momentum transfer to the particles in the atomic beam .",
    "thus in this regime , because of the darkness of the state , the photon - recoil momentum does not play a role in the evolution of internal atomic states**. * *    it should be noted that standing wave laser beams ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) offer more efficient deflection of atoms than those with traveling wave beams as in refs .",
    "@xcite- @xcite .",
    "our goal , however , will not be to find an efficient way to deflect atoms , rather , we ask a different question , namely whether is it possible to control the dynamics of atomic internal states in a _ robust _  way _ _  _ _ via the velocity - induced doppler shift of the atomic transition frequency ?",
    "to our knowledge , the problem with such formulation within the context of robustness has never been discussed before .",
    "the results of the present article show that due to doppler shifts the landau - zener transition @xcite may occur between the bright and intermediate atomic states . in the bare atomic basis , for the case when laser beams are ordered intuitively i.e. the bright state is populated , this transition corresponds to a robust population transfer from the initial to intermediate atomic state .",
    "let us consider a monoenergetic atomic beam , crossing two laser beams but not necessarily at a right angle . in particular , we consider an atomic system with three levels coupled by two counterpropagating optical fields with the same frequency @xmath2 and wave vectors @xmath3 whose parallel propagation axes are spatially shifted .",

    "the sequence of interaction of atoms with laser beams is controlled by the spatial displacement of their axes .",

    "the motion of atoms causes a doppler shift @xmath7 .",
    "the doppler shift is large for small crossing angles @xmath8 and for large crossing angles @xmath4 close to @xmath1 it tends to zero . as we will see later on , the possibility of controlling the doppler shift could provide a new way for controlling adiabatic evolution processes of internal states of atoms .",
    "the laser fields are detuned from the atomic transition by the single photon detuning @xmath9 . in",
    "what follows , we will consider only the case of exact one - photon resonance , @xmath10 .",
    "the generalization to nonzero detuning is straightforward , and requires one only to replace the recoil energy @xmath11with @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the atom - laser interaction time is much shoter than the spontaneous lifetime of state @xmath13 .",
    "this condition can be fulfilled , for example , for fast atomic beams .",
    "the atoms are described by atomic flip operators @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the atom - field coupling along the @xmath16 axis ( @xmath16 is directed along the propagation direction of the one of lasers ) in rotating wave approximation has the following form @xcite @xmath17@xmath18where @xmath19 is the mass of the atom . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are space - independent , time - delayed rabi frequencies of the pump and stocks fields , respectively . * *  * * we have omitted the transverse part of the kinetic energy since it is a conserved quantity .",

    "we are interested in the evolution of the system  with the hamiltonian ( [ schrodinger22 ] ) when the rabi frequencies @xmath20 and @xmath21 are varied adiabatically in time .      to analyze adiabatic evolution of the system , it is convenient to introduce dark , bright and atomic states by the following orthogonal transformation @xmath37the mixing angle @xmath38 is defined by@xmath39 in the adiabatic limit of slowly changing mixing angle , @xmath40the corresponding hamiltonian transforms into ( for sake of simplicity we omit below the argument @xmath41 ) . @xmath42where@xmath43@xmath44and the new orthogonal basis vectors are the dark @xmath45 and bright @xmath46 states defined in the following way@xmath47and @xmath48the structure of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_dark_bright ] ) tells us that the terms @xmath49 and @xmath50 induce transitions from the dark state to its complement subspace ( bright and atomic states ) and vice versa .",

    ". the transfer efficiency approaches unity for a relative broad range of delays .",
    "the case of stirap was discussed in @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , fig .",
    "[ fig : maximum2 ] shows that for negative delays in contrast to ordinary stirap , the state @xmath31 is substantially populated during the time evolution of the system .",
    "this indicates that the transfer does not occur via adiabatic rotation of the dark state from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .     during the evolution as a function of the time delay between the pulses .",
    "other parameters and units are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : delay ] . ]",
    "the state vector for the initial problem can be found by the inverse gauge transformation ( [ gauge_transformation ] ) which leads to the change of the atomic momentum from @xmath36 to @xmath73 .",
    "hence , if the time scale of the interaction is smaller than the radiative lifetime of state @xmath31 , and the initial momentum of the atoms @xmath36 is much smaller than the recoil momentum , an intuitive pulse sequence also transfers completely the population of the initial state @xmath74 to the state @xmath29 .",
    "hence , an atomic beam deflection can be implemented by spatially shifted laser beams with large pulse areas .",
    "the mechanism of the population transfer for the negative delays ( intuitive sequence of pulses ) can be understood qualitatively as follows : if an intuitive pulse sequence is applied , the system starts its evolution from the bright state @xmath46 , see : eq . ( [ bright_state ] ) . due to the large recoil energy ( @xmath75 ) , which plays the role of a detuning",
    ", the bright state undergoes an adiabatic return process under the condition @xmath76because of the chosen intuitive pulse order , the bright state transforms to the bare atomic state @xmath29 .",

    "the condition ( [ adiabaticreturn ] ) , however , might be questionable for atomic beams , because of the constraint on the radiative lifetime .",
    "indeed , it is important to recall that the duration of the interaction of atoms with lasers should be shorter than the upper state lifetime .",
    "therefore , the condition @xmath77 should be satisfied , where @xmath78 is the lifetime of state @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , the opposite situation occurs in many experiments e.g. with noble atoms @xcite .",

    "[ fig : delay ] . for positive large delays",
    ", the system ends its evolution in state @xmath29 , i.e. the process is stirap - like .",
    "the atom thus receives a momentum kick of @xmath80 . on the other hand , for negative delays ( around @xmath81 )",
    "the population transfer from @xmath28 to @xmath31 occurs and , therefore , the momentum of the atom in the direction of laser beams changes by @xmath82 .",
    "the transfer probability from @xmath74 to @xmath31 is robust for a wide range negative delays . in fig .",
    "[ fig : area ] we show the dependence of the final population in state @xmath31 for @xmath83 and @xmath84  as function of the pulse area @xmath85 .",

    "[ fig : area ] also shows that there is a pronounced threshold area starting at @xmath86 for an efficient population transfer into state @xmath31 .",

    "we examine the dynamics of atomic populations in the case of substantialy delayed laser pulses corresponding to small values of @xmath87 . in this case ,",
    "condition ( [ large_area ] ) is easy to satisfy for small rabi frequencies .",

    "the atoms receive a momentum kick only from the pump photons .",
    "the role of the stokes laser is to assist the landau - zener transition between the bright @xmath93 and @xmath31 states .",
    "it is shown that the doppler shift can play an important role in the population transfer in three - level atoms driven by two counterpropagating spatially shifted laser fields . in particularly , when the atoms interact with intuitively ordered laser pulses , depending on the ratio of the initial atomic and photonic momenta , the final atomic states are different .",
    "namely , for @xmath94  and large recoil energies  @xmath95 the atoms occupy state @xmath29 and receive @xmath65 momentum regardless the order of switching the laser fields , while for the case of fast atoms and an intuitive sequence of pulses , the target state is the intermediate state @xmath31 and the corresponding momentum kick is @xmath66 .",
    "we showed that in the case of slow atoms and intuitive sequence of laser pulses , the bright state , which is a linear combination of the initial @xmath28 and target @xmath29 states , undergoes an adiabatic return process ( due to the large recoil energy ) . in the bare atomic basis",
    ", this process corresponds to the @xmath28 @xmath96 @xmath64 transition .",
    "whereas in the second case ( fast atoms ) , the landau - zener transition occurs between the bright and atomic state @xmath31 and the system transforms from the initial state @xmath28 into state @xmath31 .    for an experimental observation of these effects ,",
    "the interaction time between atoms and laser fields should be short enough @xmath97 .  to fulfill this condition , a fast atom beam is required . for implementing such a situation , a metastable cold helium beam with @xmath98 and @xmath99 transitions could be a possible candidate .",
    "simple calculations show that to avoid the spontaneous emission from the excited state @xmath99 the helium atoms must enter the interaction region with velocity in the range of @xmath100 to @xmath101 m@xmath102s@xmath103 .",
    "this is achievable for metastable cold helium beams as was reported by oberst et al .",
    "another possible system which would be immune to the effects of the spontaneous decay can be an ensemble of atoms with two lower stable levels both coupled to a rydberg state by laser fields @xcite .",
    "atoms in highly excited rydberg states are remarkable stable against spontaneous emission .",
    "the interaction between rydberg atoms , however , could play an important role for the evolution of atomic populations @xcite .",
