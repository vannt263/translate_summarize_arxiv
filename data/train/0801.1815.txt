    "superfluid pairing in a two - component gas of fermions is a well - known problem @xcite lying in the background of extensive studies in condensed matter and nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "recently , this problem was actively investigated in cold gases of fermionic atoms ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "experimental efforts were focused on @xmath9li or @xmath10k atoms in two different internal ( hyperfine ) states , where one can use feshbach resonances for switching the sign and tuning the absolute value of the interspecies interaction ( scattering length @xmath4 ) , which at resonance changes from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . in this respect ,",
    "one encounters the problem of bcs - bec crossover discussed earlier in the context of superconductivity @xcite and for superfluidity of two - dimensional @xmath13he films @xcite . on the negative side of the resonance ( @xmath14 ) , one should have the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid pairing at sufficiently low temperatures , and on the positive side ( @xmath15 ) one expects bose - einstein condensation of diatomic molecules formed by atoms of different components .",
    "remarkable achievements of cold - atom physics in the last years include the observation of superfluid behavior through vortex formation in the strongly interacting regime ( @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the gas density )  @xcite , and the formation and bose - einstein condensation of long - lived weakly bound diatomic molecules at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "ongoing experiments with atomic fermi gases have reached temperatures in the nanokelvin regime , where at achieved densities one has @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being the fermi energy .",
    "for @xmath14 the experiments are now approaching superfluidity in the bcs limit where @xmath20 .",
    "currently , a new generation of experiments is being set up .",
    "in particular , it is dealing with mixtures of different fermionic atoms or mixtures of fermions and bosons .",
    "the main goal is to reveal the influence of the mass difference on superfluid properties and to search for novel types of superfluid pairing .",
    "the first experiments demonstrating a possibility of using feshbach resonances and creating collisionally stable mixtures of @xmath10k with @xmath9li and/or with @xmath21rb , and @xmath9li with @xmath22na have already been performed @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical literature on mixtures of different fermionic atoms contains a discussion of the bcs limit @xcite , the limit of molecular bec @xcite , bcs - bec crossover @xcite , and the strongly interacting regime @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a two - component mixture of fermionic atoms with different masses and attractive intercomponent interaction in the bcs limit .",
    "it is assumed that the densities of the two species are equal which means that there is no mismatch between their fermi surfaces , leading to the usual bcs type of superfluid pairing .",
    "other kinds of pairing that can occur and compete with bcs , especially for unequal densities , will be discussed elsewhere @xcite . here , we generalize the perturbation treatment of the gap equation , introduced by gorkov and melik - barkhudarov @xcite for equal masses of fermions belonging to different components .",
    "this approach takes into account the interaction between the atoms in a cooper pair due to the polarization of the medium and allows one to correctly determine the dependence of the zero - temperature gap @xmath23 and superfluid transition temperature @xmath24 on the masses of heavy ( @xmath0 ) and light ( @xmath1 ) fermionic atoms .",
    "as we shall see below , already the second order of the perturbation , the so - called gorkov - melik - barkhudarov contribution , leads to a very different dependence of the preexponential factor in the expressions for @xmath23 and @xmath24 on the mass ratio @xmath5 , compared to the prediction of the simple bcs theory .    for a large mass ratio @xmath25 ,",
    "we include higher order contributions and show that the actual small parameter of the theory is @xmath26 ( @xmath3 is the fermi momentum ) , not simply latexmath:[$p_{f}%    physical interpretation of this fact and calculate effective masses of heavy and light fermions .",
    "large mass ratios @xmath5 are realized in electron - ion plasmas , where the heavy ion component is usually considered as non - degenerate @xcite .",
    "the electron - proton pairing in the hydrogen plasma , assuming quantum degeneracy for both electrons and protons , was discussed by moulopoulos and ashcroft @xcite .",
    "they found that at low temperatures the coulomb electron - proton attraction leads to the appearance of a ( momentum - dependent ) gap which for sufficiently high densities is comparable with the coulomb interaction at the mean interparticle separation .",
    "note that this problem is quite different from ours where the attractive interaction between heavy and light fermions is short - ranged .    before proceeding with our analysis",
    "we make two important remarks .",
    "first of all , if the masses of heavy and light fermionic atoms are very different from each other and the mass ratio exceeds a critical value , @xmath28 , then two heavy and one light fermion can form @xmath8-body weakly bound states .",
    "the appearance of these states , predicted by efimov @xcite , can be easily understood in the born - oppenheimer picture @xcite .",
    "if we fix the two heavy atoms at a relative distance @xmath29 , a localized state for the light atom appears due to the presence of the heavy pair , which in turn mediates an attractive interaction @xmath30 between the heavy atoms ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . for a large mass ratio , @xmath28 , this mediated attraction overcomes the kinetic energy of the relative motion of the heavy atoms and one has the well - known phenomenon of  fall into center \" @xcite .",
    "the energy of this state is bounded from below only due to short - range repulsion .",
    "the corresponding wave function of the relative motion of heavy atoms acquires a large number of nodes thus showing the presence of many bound states .",
    "this makes the @xmath8-body problem non - universal in the sense that aside from the @xmath31-body scattering length @xmath4 , the description of this problem requires one more parameter - the so - called @xmath8-body parameter coming from short - range physics .",
    "also , the presence of weakly bound efimov states introduces a resonant character to the @xmath8-body scattering problem .",
    "this is especially important for the gorkov - melikh - barkhudarov contribution as it is actually dealing with processes involving @xmath8 particles .",
    "we , however , have found that the @xmath8-body resonances are rather narrow and their contribution is not important .",
    "this makes the gorkov - melikh - barkhudarov approach universal at any mass ratio @xmath5 .",
    "our second remark is related to analogies between bcs pairing of unequal - mass particles in cold - atom and high energy physics .",
    "we wish to emphasize that there are strong physical differences between the pairing of particles of different masses in relativistic and in nonrelativistic systems such as cold atoms .",
    "the problem arises in relativistic systems in the study of hadronic matter @xcite .",
    "it is thought that , at the high densities achieved in neutron stars , quarks become deconfined and the different types of them ( e.g. up , down and strange quarks ) will tend to form cooper pairs with each other .",
    "these different types of quarks have different masses .",
    "this relativistic limit has been investigated by kundu and rajagopal @xcite and is characterized by the fermi momentum being larger than the bare mass : @xmath32 .",
    "linearizing the momentum near the fermi surface @xmath33 , ( @xmath34 ) , we can expand the free particle energy to the lowest nonvanishing order in @xmath35 and @xmath36 : @xmath37 we see that , as far as the kinetic energy is concerned , a change in mass will amount to a shift in the chemical potential of the species which is proportional to @xmath38 and depends inversely on @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , pairing between particles with different masses in the relativistic limit is equivalent to studying the problem of pairing of equal mass particles in the presence of a difference between the chemical potentials of the two species . in the nonrelativistic limit ( @xmath39 ) the situation is different : @xmath40 and so the mass change can not be incorporated into the chemical potential , requiring a very different analysis which we carry out here .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : bcs ] we present general equations , and in sections iii and iv we calculate the critical temperature @xmath24 .",
    "section v is dedicated to the discussion of the small parameter of the theory , and in section vi we discuss the order parameter and excitation spectrum . in sec .",
    "vii we analyze the three - body resonances at a large mass ratio @xmath5 and show that they do not change the result of the gorkov - melik - barkhudarov approach . in sec .",
    "viii we conclude .",
    "we consider a uniform gas composed of heavy and light fermionic atoms with masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "both heavy and light atoms are in a single hyperfine state , and considering low temperatures we omit heavy - heavy and light - light interactions .",
    "the interaction of heavy atoms with light ones is assumed to be attractive and characterized by a negative s - wave scattering length @xmath14 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system has the form:@xmath41   , \\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the field operators of fermionic atoms labeled by indices @xmath44 ( heavy ) and @xmath45 ( light ) , @xmath46 is the corresponding chemical potential , and @xmath47 is the coupling constant , with @xmath48 being the reduced mass . since the densities of the two species are equal , @xmath49 , they have the same fermi momentum @xmath50 , and , hence , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "finally , we require that the system be in the weakly interacting regime , which requires the inequality @xmath53 .",

    ", the conventional perturbation theory does not work for the reasons explained in section v. in order to construct a reliable theory one should at least renormalize the interaction between heavy and light fermions by making an exact resummation of diagrams containing loops of heavy and light fermions .",
