    "decoherence may be defined as the ( partial ) destruction of quantum coherence through the interaction of a quantum mechanical system with its surroundings . in the theoretical analysis decoherence",
    "can be studied with the help of simple microscopic models which describe , for example , the interaction of a quantum mechanical system with a collection of an infinite number of harmonic oscillators , representing the environmental degrees of freedom @xcite . in an open system",
    "s approach to decoherence one derives dynamic equations for the reduced density matrix @xcite which yields the state of the system of interest as it is obtained from an average over the degrees of freedom of the environment and the resulting loss of information on the entangled state of the combined total system . the strong suppression of coherence",
    "can then be explained by showing that the reduced density matrix equation leads to an extremely rapid transitions of a coherent superposition to an incoherent statistical mixture @xcite . for certain superpositions the associated decoherence time scale",
    "is often found to be smaller than the corresponding relaxation or damping time by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this is a signature for the fundamental distinction between the notions of decoherence and of dissipation .",
    "a series of interesting experimental investigations of decoherence have been performed as , for example , experiments on schrdinger cat states of a cavity field mode @xcite and on single trapped ions in a controllable environment @xcite .    if one considers the coherence of charged matter , it is the electromagnetic field which plays the rle of the environment .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study the emergence of decoherence processes in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) from an open system s point of view , that is by an elimination of the degrees of freedom of the radiation field .",
    "an appropriate technique to achieve this goal is the use of functional methods from field theory . in section 2",
    "we combine these methods with a super - operator approach to derive an exact , relativistic representation for the reduced density matrix of the matter degrees of freedom .",
    "this representation involves an influence phase functional that completely describes the influence of the electromagnetic radiation field on the matter dynamics .",
    "the influence phase functional may be viewed as a super - operator representation of the feynman - vernon influence phase @xcite which is usually obtained with the help of path integral techniques .    in section 3",
    "we treat the problem of a single electron in the radiation field within the non - relativistic approximation .",
    "starting from the influence phase functional , we formulate the reduced electron motion in terms of a path integral which involves an effective action functional .",
    "the corresponding classical equations of motion are demonstrated to yield the abraham - lorentz equation describing the radiation damping of the electron motion .",
    "in addition , the influence phase is shown to lead to a decoherence function which provides a measure for the degree of decoherence .",
    "the general theory will be illustrated with the help of two examples , namely a free electron ( section 4 ) and an electron moving in a harmonic potential ( section 5 ) .",
    "for both cases an analytical expression for the decoherence function is found , which describes how the radiation field affects the electron coherence .",
    "we shall use the obtained expressions to investigate in detail the time - evolution of gaussian wave packets .",
    "we study the influence of the radiation field on the interference pattern which results from the collision of two moving wave packets of a coherent superposition .",
    "it turns out that the basic mechanism leading to the decoherence of matter waves is the emission of bremsstrahlung through the moving wave packets . the resultant picture of decoherence is shown to yield expressions for the decoherence time and length scales which differ substantially from the conventional estimates derived from the prominent caldeira - leggett master equation .",
    "in particular , it will be shown that a superposition of two wave packets with zero velocity does not decohere and , thus , the usual picture of decoherence as a decay of the off - diagonal peaks in the corresponding density matrix does not apply to decoherence through bremsstrahlung .",
    "we investigate in section 6 the possibility of the destruction of coherence of the superposition of many - particle states .",
    "it will be argued that , while the decoherence effect is small for single electrons at non - relativistic speed , it is drastically amplified for certain superpositions of many - particle states .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section 7 .",
    "our aim is to eliminate the variables of the electromagnetic radiation field to obtain an exact representation for the reduced density matrix @xmath0 of the matter degrees of freedom .",
    "the starting point will be the following formal equation which relates the density matrix @xmath1 of the matter at some final time @xmath2 to the density matrix @xmath3 of the combined matter - field system at some initial time @xmath4 , @xmath5 \\rho(t_i )       \\right\\}.\\ ] ] the liouville super - operator @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 denotes the hamiltonian density .",

    "setting @xmath13 we shall use here heaviside - lorentz units such that the fine structure constant is given by @xmath14 to be specific we choose the coulomb gauge in the following which means that the hamiltonian density takes the form @xcite @xmath15 here , @xmath16 represents the density of the interaction of the matter current density @xmath17 with the transversal radiation field , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the coulomb energy density such that @xmath20 is the instantaneous coulomb energy . note",

    "we then get @xmath335.\\ ] ] this clearly demonstrates that it is the motion of the wave packets which is responsible for the reduction of of the interference contrast : if one sets into relative motion the two components of the superposition in order to check locally their capability to interfere , a decoherence effect is caused by the creation of a radiation field . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq:130 ] ) the spectrum of the radiation field emitted through the moving charge is proportional to @xmath336 which is a typical signature for the emission of bremsstrahlung .",
    "thus we observe that the physical origin for the loss of coherence described by the decoherence function is the creation of bremsstrahlung .",
    "it is important to recognize that the frequency integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq:130 ] ) converges for @xmath337 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq:134 ] ) .",
    "the decoherence function @xmath222 is thus infrared convergent which is obviously due to the fact that we consider here a process on a finite time scale @xmath2 .",
    "this means that we have a natural infrared cutoff of the order of @xmath338 , in addition to the natural ultraviolet cutoff @xmath275 introduced earlier .",
    "the important conclusion is that the decoherence function is therefore infrared as well as ultraviolet convergent .",
    "it might be instructive , finally , to compare our results with the corresponding expressions which are derived from the famous caldeira - leggett master equation in the high - temperature limit ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . from the latter one",

    "namely , for @xmath342 we have @xmath343 and , therefore , complete coherence in the case of bremsstrahlung and total destruction of coherence in the caldeira - leggett case .",
    "as a further illustration let us investigate briefly the case of an electron in the radiation field moving in a harmonic external potential .",
    "another approach to this problem may be found in @xcite , where the authors arrive , however , at the conclusion that there is no decoherence effect in the vacuum case .",
    "we take @xmath344 and solve the equation of motion ( [ eq:113 ] ) with the help of the ansatz @xmath345 where , for simplicity , we consider the motion to be one - dimensional . substituting this ansatz into ( [ eq:113 ] ) one",

    "for @xmath351 the cubic equation has three roots , one is real and the other two are complex conjugated to each other .",
    "the real root corresponds to the runaway solution and must be discarded .",
    "let us assume that the period of the oscillator is large compared to the radiation time , @xmath352 because of @xmath353s this assumption is well satisfied even in the regime of optical frequencies .",
    "we may thus determine the complex roots to lowest order in @xmath354 , @xmath355 the purely imaginary roots @xmath356 of the undisturbed harmonic oscillator are thus shifted into the negative half plane under the influence of the radiation field .",
    "the negative real part describes the radiative damping .",

    "we then have @xmath362 .",
    "in this case the damping can be neglected and we may use the free solution in order to determine the decoherence function .",

    "we take @xmath274 to be of the order of @xmath375s and @xmath2 of the order of 1s . using a velocity @xmath376 which is already as large as @xmath377 of the speed of light",
    ", one finds that @xmath378 , corresponding to a reduction of the interference contrast of about @xmath379 .",
    "this demonstrates that the electromagnetic field vacuum is quite ineffective in destroying the coherence of single electrons .    for a superposition of many - particle states the above picture can lead , however , to a dramatic increase of the decoherence effect .",
    "consider the superposition latexmath:[\\[\\label{super - n }    spatially separated @xmath214-particle states @xmath381 and @xmath382 .",
    "we have seen that decoherence results from the imaginary part of the influence phase functional @xmath383 $ ] , that is from the last term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:39 ] ) involving the anti - commutator function @xmath384 of the electromagnetic field .",

    "this shows that the decoherence function for @xmath214-electron states scales with the square @xmath386 of the particle number .",
    "thus we conclude that for the case of the superposition ( [ super - n ] ) the decoherence function must be multiplied by a factor of @xmath386 , that is the decoherence factor for @xmath214-particle states takes the form , @xmath387.\\ ] ] this scaling with the particle number obviously leads to a dramatic increase of decoherence for the superposition of @xmath214-particle states . to give an example we take @xmath388 , corresponding to 1 mol , and ask for the maximal velocity @xmath376 leading to a @xmath379 suppression of interference . with the help of ( [ dec - n ] ) we find that @xmath389 m/s",
    "this means that , in order to perform an interference experiment with 1 mol electrons with only @xmath379 decoherence , a velocity of at most @xmath390 m/s may be used . for a distance of 1 m this implies , for example , that the experiment would take @xmath391 years !",
    "in this paper the equations governing a basic decoherence mechanism occurring in qed have been developed , namely the suppression of coherence through the emission of bremsstrahlung .",
    "the latter is created whenever two spatially separated wave packets of a coherent superposition are moved to one place , which is indispensable if one intends to check locally their capability to interfere .",
    "we have seen that the decoherence effect through the electromagnetic radiation field is extremely small for single , non - relativistic electrons .",
    "the decoherence mechanism is thus very ineffective on the compton length scale .",
    "an important conclusion is that decoherence does _ not _ lead to a localization of the particle on arbitrarily small length scales and that no problems with associated uv - divergences arise here .",
    "the decoherence mechanism through bremsstrahlung exhibits a highly non - markovian character . as a result the usual picture of decoherence as a decay of the off - diagonals in the reduced density matrix does not apply .",
    "in fact , consider a superposition of two wave packets with zero velocity .",
    "the expression ( [ eq:163 ] ) for the decoherence function together with the estimate @xmath392 for the vacuum coherence length @xmath393 show that decoherence effects are negligible for times @xmath2 which are large in comparison to the time it takes light to travel the distance between the wave packets .",
    "the off - diagonal terms of the reduced density matrix for the electron do therefore not decay at all , which shows the profound difference between the decoherence mechanism through bremsstrahlung and other decoherence mechanisms ( see , e.  g. @xcite ) .",
    "a result of particular interest from a fundamental point of view is that coherence can already be destroyed by the presence of the electromagnetic field vacuum if superpositions of many - particle states are considered .",
    "an important conclusion which can be drawn from this picture of decoherence in qed refers to various alternative approaches to decoherence and the closely related measurement problem of quantum mechanics : in recent years several attempts have been made to modify the schrdinger equation by the addition of stochastic terms with the aim to explain the non - existence of macroscopic superpositions through some kind of macrorealism .",
    "namely , the random terms in the schrdinger equation lead to a spontaneous destruction of superpositions in such a way that macroscopic objects are practically always in definite localized states .",
    "such approaches obviously require the introduction of previously unknown physical constants . in the stochastic theory of ghirardi , pearle and rimini @xcite , for example",
    ", a single particle microscopic jump rate of about @xmath394 has to be introduced such that decoherence is extremely weak for single particles but acts sufficiently strong for many particle assemblies .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the decoherence effect caused by the presence of the quantum field vacuum yields a similar time scale in a completely natural way without the introduction of new physical parameters .",
    "thus , qed indeed provides a consistent picture of decoherence and it seems unnecessary to propose new ad hoc theories for this purpose .    it must be emphasized that the above picture of decoherence in qed has been derived from the well - established basic postulates of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory .",
    "it therefore does not , of course , constitute a logical disprove of alternative approaches .",
    "however , it does represent an example for a basic decoherence mechanism in a microscopic quantum field theory .",
    "in particular , it provides a unified explanation of decoherence which does not suffer from problems with renormalization ( as they occur , e.g. in alternative theories @xcite ) and which does not exclude a priori the existence of macroscopic quantum coherence . only under certain well - defined conditions regarding time scales , relative velocities and the structure of the state vector , it is true that decoherence becomes important .",
    "thus , decoherence is traced back to a dynamical effect and not to a modification of the basic principles of quantum mechanics .    in this paper",
    "we have discussed in detail only the non - relativistic approximation of the reduced electron dynamics . for a treatment of the full relativistic theory , including a lorentz invariant characterization of the decoherence induced by the vacuum field",
    ", one can start from the formal development given in section 2 .",
