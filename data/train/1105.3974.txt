    "materials featuring magnetic moments situated on corner - shared triangles or tetrahedra provide an exciting domain for the discovery of exotic physics .",
    "recently one class of such _ geometrically frustrated magnets _ ( gfm ) , spin - ice materials , garnered attention due to the possibility of interpreting the excitations from the ground states as effectively deconfined magnetic monopoles @xcite .",
    "several experimental groups have claimed @xcite to have observed these so - called monopoles , and have pointed out that they would likely pass several of the experimental tests for the existence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "of particular interest was that these fractional spin excitations appear to be deconfined or essentially free in three dimensions.@xcite recently we have shown that spin ice physics should also arise on the three - dimensional trillium @xcite and hyperkagome @xcite lattices .    in a second class of gfm , heisenberg spin systems ,",
    "a long sought goal has been the realization of a truly three - dimensional quantum spin liquid .",
    "indeed , the belief in the existence of such a state strongly influenced the original resonating valence bond model of high temperature superconductivity@xcite .",
    "therefore it was with great excitement that the community welcomed the mott insulating na@xmath3ir@xmath4o@xmath5 which features antiferromagnetically correlated spin 1/2 magnetic moments and does not magnetically order to very low temperatures@xcite .",
    "these phenomena are well captured by a simple classical monte carlo treatment of the heisenberg model on the three dimensional corner - shared equilateral triangle hyperkagome lattice@xcite , which additionally predicted the onset of a finite temperature nematic transition .",
    "early quantum treatments of the physics of this material have argued that at least over a finite temperature range one has indeed found a quantum spin liquid@xcite or at least a valence bond crystal.@xcite    it has been considerably more difficult to experimentally realize such exotic physics on the simpler two - dimensional kagome net , perhaps because materials are inherently three - dimensional .",
    "indeed , after decades of searching , the first experimental realization of antiferromagnetic correlations on a structurally perfect spin 1/2 kagome lattice , zncu@xmath4(oh)@xmath6cl@xmath0,@xcite appeared only in 2005 , followed soon after by the related zncu@xmath4(od)@xmath6cl@xmath0 which shows evidence of a valence bond solid state @xcite .",
    "however , even in these materials questions remain about the realization of a purely kagome lattice , given the recently measured non - magnetic site disorder of the order of 6% within the magnetic cu plane@xcite .",
    "interestingly , a large class of magnetic materials including some ( non - superconducting ) iron pnictides and the langasites form in a distorted kagome structure with a nearest neighbour topology equivalent to that of the kagome lattice . among these , nd langasite ( nd@xmath4ga@xmath7sio@xmath8 ) has previously been studied as a spin liquid candidate@xcite , while fecras shows intriguing thermodynamic and transport signatures.@xcite magnetically , fecras has been seen@xcite to exhibit a @xmath9 magnetic ordering with wavevector of @xmath2 below 125k .",
    "while the nature of the spin-@xmath10 quantum heisenberg model on the kagome lattice remains an important open problem@xcite , the classical antiferromagnetic heisenberg model has been shown@xcite to have degenerate so - called @xmath11 and @xmath9 ground states , and exhibit an order by disorder transition to select the latter at @xmath12 , resulting in a local nematic ordering with a diverging correlation length in the limit @xmath12@xcite .",

    "the nearly isotropic resistivity and magnetic susceptibility , and the existence of the phase transition at finite temperatures speak to the possibility that we have a truly three dimensional material , naturally leading us to ask what the effect of a magnetic coupling between frustrated distorted kagome planes would lead to .",
    "curiously , the addition of an interlayer coupling between stacked kagome planes to an antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , and its role in leading to possible magnetic order , appears not to have received much attention .",
    "the spin-@xmath10 quantum antiferromagnetic heisenberg model has been treated on the stacked kagome lattice by d. schmalfu  _ et al._@xcite using a spin - rotation - invariant green s function method ( supported by classical spin - wave calculations ) , finding the system to remain `` short - range ordered independent of the strength and sign of the interlayer coupling . '' for classical spins , m. zelli _",
    "et al._@xcite used a short - time dynamics monte carlo method , scaling analysis and binder cumulants to study the ordering properties of a generalized antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a stacked triangular lattice . a limiting case of this model",

    "however , when the couplings between kagome planes are mediated by other magnetic sites , a dramatically different result can be expected .",
    "fecras is an example of such coupled kagome systems in which both fe and cr are magnetic ions , and the dominant magnetic interaction is believed to be an antiferromagnetic heisenberg coupling between local moments on the cr sites .",
    "the cr sites form stacked distorted kagome planes .",
    "three nearest fe ions form a trimer ( triangle ) , which can be viewed as an effectively single magnetic site .",

    "this can not be physical , however , it is hoped that the higher temperature classical phase transitions may remain relevant . in this sense we see that as we turn on the coupling between the cr atoms ( from @xmath109 ) , the transition temperature decreases monotonically until the point @xmath110 below which two transitions ( see fig .",

    "<S> motivated by recent experimental work on fecras , we study the magnetic properties of classical spin models on the hexagonal fe@xmath0p / zrnial structure ( space group @xmath1 ) </S>",
    "<S> . when both transition metal / rare earth sites carry magnetic moments , one has alternating distorted kagome and triangular lattice layers . </S>",
    "<S> each point of the triangular lattice lies at the centre of a distorted hexagon and actually corresponds to three isolated magnetic atoms : a `` trimer '' . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a simple model consisting of antiferromagnetically correlated heisenberg spins on the frustrated distorted kagome lattice coupling either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically to heisenberg spins at the average position of a trimer , leads to a rich phase diagram , including the possible selection of a @xmath2 magnetic order as may have been seen in fecras . </S>"
