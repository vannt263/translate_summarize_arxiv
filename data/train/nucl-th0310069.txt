    "in a radioactive decay series , the end product is reached not only via the emission of @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles but also directly via heavy nuclei emission , the clusters , like carbon , oxygen , florine , neon , magnesium and silicon .",
    "such a process is known as cluster decay , first proposed theoretically in 1980 by sndulescu , poenaru and greiner @xcite , before its experimental realization in 1984 by rose and jones @xcite . in this decay process a parent nucleus ( a , z ) , with mass number a and charge number z , breaks into two fragments , _ viz .",
    ", _ the emitted cluster ( a@xmath5,z@xmath5 ) and the associated daughter ( a@xmath6,z@xmath6 ) , where a = a@xmath6+a@xmath5 , z = z@xmath6+z@xmath5 .",
    "the light fragment ( a@xmath5,z@xmath5 ) is a cluster , heavier than the @xmath3-particle but lighter than the lightest fission fragment observed so far .",
    "the detection of cluster - decay was hindered mainly due to large pile - up of @xmath3 particles , but with improved facilities these difficulties are removed and a large number of cluster - decays are observed from different radioactive nuclei . in the years that followed , the cluster decay process has been studied extensively using different theoretical models with different realistic nuclear interaction potentials . in general , two kinds of models are used for explaining the observed and/ or for predicting new decay modes . in one kind of these models ,",
    "the @xmath3-particle as well as the heavy cluster(s ) were assumed to be pre - born in a parent nucleus , before they could penetrate the barrier with the available q - value .",
    "these models are called the preformed cluster models @xcite . in such a model ,",
    "the clusters of different sizes ( mass and/ or charge numbers ) are considered to be preformed in the parent nucleus , with different probabilities .",
    "the gamow - like barrier penetration is also taken into account in these models . in the other kind of models , only the gamow s idea of barrier penetration",
    "is used , without considering the cluster(s ) being or not being preformed in the parent nucleus . in other words ,",
    "in this kind of models , called the unified fission models @xcite , the cluster radioactivity is considered as a simple barrier penetration phenomenon , in between the @xmath3-decay and the spontaneous fission . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to give a model - independent , semiempirical formula for studying this above mentioned process of exotic cluster decay .",
    "geiger and nuttal @xcite were the first who proposed a semiempirical law connecting the @xmath3-decay half - life and its q - value .",
    "now , a large number of @xmath3-decays are observed from medium mass to superheavy nuclei , and several attempts have been made to give a universal formula @xcite .",
    "these formulae vary among themselves mainly in the number of parameters .",
    "one such scaling law , proposed recently by horoi _ et al _ @xcite , accounts for both the @xmath3 and cluster decays , and is given as , @xmath7+(a_2\\mu^x+b_2 ) .",
    "\\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] this scaling law involves six parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which were obtained by fitting 119 @xmath3-decays and 11 cluster - decays from various even - even parents . in the following , we propose a new semiempirical formula based on only three parameters that are least squares fitted to the cluster - decay data alone .",
    "so far , no attempt has been made to fit the @xmath3-decay data .",
    "the evolution of our proposed formula is presented in section ii , followed by a brief description of the preformed cluster model ( pcm ) of gupta and collaborators @xcite in section iii .",
    "the pcm is recently used by two of us and collaborators @xcite to calculate the cluster - decay half - lives of some deformed and superdeformed gd and nd parents . some of these results of ref .",
    "@xcite are used here for comparisons with the calculations based on the proposed new semiempirical formula .",
    "the results of our calculation are discussed in section iv , and the summary and conclusions are presented in section v.",
    "we base the new formula for cluster decay half - lives on the following three simple experimental facts : +    \\(i ) it is known from experiments that the cluster decay half - lives increase with the size ( mass and/or charge ) of the clusters .",
    "hence , the empirical formula should contain terms showing direct dependence on the mass number and charge number of the cluster .",
    "\\(ii ) the same cluster is emitted by different parents and hence the formula should contain dependence on the mass and charge asymmetries @xmath14 respectively .",
    "\\(iii ) since the @xmath3-decay and cluster - decay are physically similar processes , the q - dependence is taken to be the same as in geiger - nuttal law for @xmath3-decay , i.e. , @xmath15 .    combining the above three results , we get @xmath16 where the constants @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are obtained by making a least squares fit of the available experimental half - lives for exotic cluster decays alone , with an rms deviation @xmath20=0.89(s ) , defined as @xmath21 ^ 2 $ ] , with @xmath22 denoting the function in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , n the number of measurements and @xmath23 the experimentally observed values .",
    "the @xmath24=@xmath25 , the variance , gives the standard deviation @xmath26 , with @xmath27 giving the arithmetic average of the expermentally measured quantities .",
    "we refer to this formula as the _ az - formula _ ( _ azf _ ) .",
    "note that the dependence on both @xmath28 and @xmath29 must be included in the formula ( [ eq:3 ] ) since these are separately measurable quantities , though the coupling between them is known to be weak @xcite , as is also evident when we consider the @xmath28 and @xmath29 dependence separately .",
    "these special cases of az - formula , i.e. , @xmath30=0 or @xmath31=0 in ( [ eq:3 ] ) , respectively , are expected to give reasonably good results , though poorer than the azf results .",
    "these truncated expressions are referred to as the _ af _ and _ zf _ formulae in the following , whose constants are also obtained directly by the least squares fit to data .",
    "these are : @xmath32 and @xmath33 for af and @xmath34 and @xmath35 for zf , with rms deviations @xmath20=1.652 and 1.112 ( s ) , respectively .",
    "apparently , the rms deviations for truncated expressions are larger , and hence the fits are poorer , compared to the total expression ( [ eq:3 ] )",
    ". this will also be evident when we compare the results of these expressions with experimental data in section iv .",
    "in the prefomed cluster model ( pcm ) of gupta and collaborators @xcite , the decay half - life is given in terms of three factors , the p@xmath36 , p and @xmath37 , as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the preformation probability of the two fragments ( the cluster and daughter nuclei ) in their respective ground states , p the probability to tunnel the confining nuclear interaction barrier and @xmath37 as an assault frequency .",
    "for calculating @xmath40 and p , gupta _ et al .",
    "_ introduced the coupled motion in dynamical collective coordinates of mass asymmetry @xmath28 and relative separation r via a stationary schrdinger equation @xmath41 with the potential in it defined by the sum of experimental binding energies @xcite , the coulomb and the proximity @xcite potentials , as @xmath42 here the charges z@xmath43 are fixed by minimizing the potential ( without v@xmath44 ) in the charge asymmetry co - ordinate @xmath45 .",
    "equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) is solved in the decoupled approximation , which gives @xmath46 @xmath47 only the ground state solution is relevant for the cluster decay to occur in the ground state of the daughter nucleus .",
    "then , for @xmath28-motion , the properly normalized fractional preformation probability for , say , cluster a@xmath5 at a fixed r ( = r@xmath48=c@xmath49=c@xmath6+c@xmath5 , c@xmath43 being the sssmann central radii ) is @xmath50 for r - motion , the potential v(r ) is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) for fixed @xmath28 and , instead of solving the corresponding radial schrdinger equation , the wkb approximation is used for calculating the penetrability p. finally , the assault frequency @xmath37 in pcm is defined by considering that the total kinetic energy , shared between the two fragments , is the positive q - value : @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the spherical radius of the parent nucleus and @xmath53 , the nucleon mass .",
    "figure 1 and table i give our calculated logarithms of decay half - lives by using the _ az - formula _ ( [ eq:3 ] ) for different clusters emitted from various radioactive parents , compared with the experimental data . in fig . 1",
    ", we have also plotted the results of our calucations for _ af _ ( @xmath54 ) and _ zf _ ( @xmath55 ) versions of the _ az - formula_. it is evident that the azf fit to the data is better than the af and zf fits , as expected from our discussion above in section ii .    in table",
    "i , we have also added the experimental data on q - values and the results of another calculation using eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) of horio et al . @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the experiments and formulae ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) are also displayed in fig .",
    "2 for the illustrative cases of @xmath56 and @xmath57 cluster decays ( respectively , the upper and lower panel ) . apparently , our semiempirical _",
    "az - formula _ is much closer to experiments , as compared to the other formula due to horio et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , in order to compare the results of our semiempirical formula with the results of a model - dependent theoretical cluster decay calculation , we use a recent calculation @xcite of two of us ( mb and rkg ) and collaborators based on pcm for the emission of @xmath58 and @xmath56 clusters from @xmath59nd and @xmath60gd parents .",
    "it may be mentioned here that these cluster - decay calculations are of interest only for nuclear structure information since their experimental observation may not be feasible in the near future @xcite .",
    "3(a ) to ( d ) show the results of the pcm calculations , compared with those from the semiempirical _ az - formula _",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) and the scaling law ( [ eq:1 ] ) of horoi _ et al . _ @xcite .",
    "we notice that , in general , the predictions of our semiempirical law lie higher than those of the pcm and horoi _",
    "et al_. this is more so for nd parents than for gd parents where the predictions of the three calculations are nearly similar .",
    "the interesting point is that the three calculations predict an exactly the same structure for @xmath61 vs. a , the parent mass number . for quantitative comparisons",
    ", it may be reminded here that the constants a , b and c of our semiemprical formula are obtained by fitting the data from trans - actinide region , which may or may not be good for this trans - tin region .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a model - independent three parameter formula for calculating the half - lives of cluster decays of nuclei .",
    "the evolution of the formula is based on three simple experimental observations about the characteristics of exotic cluster decays .",
    "the inputs of the formula are simply the mass and charge numbers of the parent and cluster , along with the q - value of decay .",
    "the predictions of the proposed formula are comparable to another model - independent scaling law as well as to the well known preformed cluster model .",
    "the resulting good comparisons suggest that this formula could be used to make predictions for the guide of new experiments , similar to that of poenaru _ et al .",
