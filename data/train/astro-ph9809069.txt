    "extragalactic radio sources have been studied for many years , but it is still unclear how they are formed and evolve .",
    "a crucial element in the study of their evolution is to identify the young counterparts of the `` old '' fri / frii extended objects .",
    "good candidates for young radio sources are those with peaked spectra ( gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources and compact steep spectrum ( css ) sources , fanti et al .",
    "1995 , readhead et al .",
    "1996 , odea and baum 1997 , odea 1998 ) , because they are small in angular size as expected for young sources .",
    "gps sources are characterized by a convex radio spectrum peaking at a frequency of about 1 ghz and are typically 100 pc in size .",
    "css sources have a peak in their spectrum at lower frequencies and have projected linear sizes of @xmath4 kpc . a commonly discussed alternative to them being young ,",
    "is that they are small due to confinement by a particularly dense and clumpy interstellar medium that impedes the outward propagation of the jets ( odea et al 1991 ) .",
    "important information about the nature of gigahertz peaked spectrum gps sources comes from the properties of their optical counterparts .",
    "systematic optical identification programs on gps sources have been performed by odea et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , stanghellini et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and de vries et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and these show that the optical counterparts are a mixture of galaxies and quasars . odea et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and stanghellini et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found that disturbed optical morphologies are a common characteristic of gps galaxies , with many of them having close companions or appearing to lie in a group or cluster .",
    "this may indicate that galaxy - galaxy interactions and/or mergers play an important role in the gps phenomenon .",
    "gps galaxies appear to be a homogeneous class of giant ellipticals with old stellar populations ( snellen et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b , odea et al .",
    "their optical to near - infrared fluxes seem not to be contaminated by light produced by the active nucleus , and they are therefore potentially useful probes of galaxy evolution .    in the light of the orientation unification scheme ( eg .",
    "barthel 1989 ) , it would be expected that the redshift distributions of gps sources identified with galaxies and quasars are more or less the same .",
    "however , the gps quasars tend to be at much higher redshift than the galaxies ( @xmath5 , odea et al .",
    "in addition , the intrinsic peak frequency distributions and radio morphologies seem to be different for gps galaxies and quasars ( stanghellini et al . 1996 ) .",
    "these results are probably influenced by several selection effects , but if true , they may indicate that gps galaxies and quasars are not unified by orientation , but form separate classes of object which happen to have similar radio spectra .    to further address these issues ,",
    "we have started to investigate gps sources at fainter flux density levels ( snellen et al .",
    "1995 , snellen et al .",
    "1998 ) than those in the samples of bright gps sources studied until now ( odea et al .",
    "1991 , de vries et al .",
    "1997 , stanghellini et al .",
    "1998 ) . by comparing the properties of these new faint samples with those of bright samples in the literature",
    ", we shall investigate properties of gps sources as a function of radio luminosity , redshift and rest frame peak frequency .",
    "this paper describes the optical and near - infrared imaging of a sample of faint gps sources selected from the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss rengelink et al .",
    "the selection of the sample has been described in detail in snellen et al .",
    "1998 ( paper i ) .",
    "candidate gps sources selected from the westerbork northern sky survey , are those with an inverted spectrum between 325 mhz and higher frequencies .",
    "the sources are located in two regions of the survey ; one at @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which is called the _ mini - survey _ region ( rengelink et al . 1997 ) , and the other at @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "additional observations at 1.4 , 5 , 8.4 and 15 ghz were carried out with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) and the very large array ( vla ) , yielding a sample of 47 genuine gps sources with peak frequencies ranging from 500 mhz to more than 15 ghz , and peak flux densities ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10 mjy . to determine whether the gps sources have an optical counterpart on the palomar sky survey plates ( poss ) , the automatic plate measuring ( apm ) catalogue ( irwin et al .",
    "1994 ) and the hst guide star catalogue ( russel et al . 1990 ) were used for the sources in the mini - survey region and in the region @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "this information was used for finding charts , to determine the required exposure times for the observations , and for astrometric purposes .",
    "the sample was imaged in the optical in the course of three observing sessions ( see table [ observations ] ) , with the 0.9 m jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) , the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) and the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) , all located at observatorio del roque de los muchachos on la palma , spain .",
    "the sample was also observed in the near - infrared with the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) , and with the not .",
    "the int , not and wht observations were done as part of the international cci observing time awarded to the wenss team in 1995 .    during the different observing sessions , several standard stars from landolt ( 1983 ) were observed for photometric calibration .",
    "a summary of the relevant parameters for the observations is given in table [ observations ] ."

    "<S> this means that the true peak frequency distribution is different for the gps galaxies and quasars , because the sample selection effects are independent of optical identification . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between peak frequency and redshift as has been suggested for bright sources has not been found in this sample ; no correlation exists between @xmath0 magnitude ( and therefore redshift ) and peak frequency for the gps galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore believe that the claimed correlation is actually caused by the dependence of the peak frequency on optical host , because the gps galaxies are in general at lower redshifts than the quasars . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the peak frequency distributions of the gps galaxies and quasars is further evidence against the hypothesis that they form a single class of object . </S>"
