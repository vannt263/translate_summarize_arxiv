    "thus , the fi in fact should be written as @xmath70 , while we adopt the notation @xmath71 for convenience here . in the following , by evaluating the fi we want to find both the optimal initial detector preparation and the smallest temperature value that can be discriminated .",
    "we will work with dimensionless quantities by rescaling time and temperature @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the spontaneous emission rate of the atom . for convenience , we continue to term @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , as @xmath76 and @xmath33 .",

    "this means that the fi displays a robust maximum at the optimal time @xmath62 for all @xmath82 .",
    "we can also obtain the same results from the bottom panel of fig .",
    "it is shown that the fi evolves periodically as a function of the initial state parameter @xmath82 and for any time the maximal fi is always obtained by taking @xmath83 , i.e. , by preparing the detector in the ground state .",

    "thus , we can arrive at the conclusion that the maximum sensitivity in the predictions for the inverse unruh temperature can be obtained by initially preparing the detector in its ground state .",
    "however , if the detector evolves for a long enough time , the maximum sensitivity in the predictions is independent on the initial state in which the detector is prepared .",
    "it is no surprise because the accelerated detector eventually evolves to a thermal state regardless of its initial state @xcite .    in fig .",
    "2 we plot the fi for different fixed temperatures as a function of time @xmath33 .",
    "we can see that the fi approaches its maximum value when the detector evolves for a long enough time .",
    "also its value for different @xmath76 varies over several orders of magnitude , changing from @xmath85 to @xmath86 , which means the fi is very dependent on the temperature itself .",
    "as we demonstrated above , the reason for saturation is that the accelerated detector eventually evolves to a thermal state regardless of its initial state @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in this case , the thermal state only depends on the thermal temperature felt by the detector , i.e. , the acceleration of the detector . on the other hand , the higher the temperature ,",
    "the bigger the fi is , i.e. , the easier it is to achieve a given precision in the estimation of temperature .      in order to assess the performance of the population measurement in the estimation of the unruh temperature we have evaluated the qfi of the family of states @xmath39 in eq .",

    "( [ eigenvalues ] ) and ( [ ab ] ) into ( [ qfih ] ) , it is easy to obtain the qfi .",
    "let us note that the qfi depends on @xmath76 , @xmath33 and @xmath82 , but is independent of the phase @xmath68 of the detector .",
    "thus , to find out the optimal working regimes we have to maximize the value of the qfi over all three relevant parameters .",
    "similar to the analyses of the fi shown above , we first fix the unruh temperature by assuming @xmath79 , and discuss how the effective time @xmath33 ( initial state parameter @xmath82 ) affects the qfi for different initial state parameters @xmath82 ( effective time @xmath33 ) . obviously , from fig .",
    "3 we know that the maximum of the qfi is achieved by initially preparing the detector in the ground state . however , if the effective time is long enough , i.e. , the detector evolves for a long enough time , @xmath62 , no matter what the initial state is prepared in , the qfi always achieves the maximum , which means the optimal sensitivity in estimation of @xmath76 is independent of the initial preparation of the detector if the effective time is long enough .",
    "besides , in fig .",
    "4 we plot the qfi for different fixed temperatures as a function of the effective time @xmath33 .",
    "we find that , if the detector evolves for a long enough time , the qfi we computed above for different unruh temperatures saturates at different values which vary over several orders of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , the higher the temperature , the bigger the qfi is , i.e. , the easier it is to achieve a given precision in the estimation of temperature .",
    "thus , we can arrive at the conclusion that the maximum sensitivity in the predictions for the inverse unruh temperature can be obtained when the detector evolves for a long enough time , and the maximum sensitivity in the predictions is independent on the initial state in which the detector is prepared . in this case",
    "we want to emphasize that this strategy provides optimality in the sense that inequality ( [ qcr ] ) is saturated and the variance var(@xmath76 ) is as small as possible .",
    "we find that for @xmath62 both the fi and qfi take the maximum limit .",
    "interestingly , upon inspecting the temporal evolution of the excited state probability , @xmath87 has a minimum under this condition ( also the quantum state of the detector is thermal discussed in eq .",
    "( [ thermal ] ) ) .",
    "thus , we can give a physical explanation to the fi and qfi behavior . because we want to estimate a tiny quantity that carries information about thermal disorder , of course , only when the external environment is mostly occupied by the unruh thermal particle , and the more the better",
    ", we then could expect to find the maximum sensitivity in the predictions .",
    "this condition corresponds to the probability @xmath87 achieving its minimum .    in the above analysis",
    ", we have shown the behaviors of the fi and qfi , and obtained the conditions that how to achieve the maximum fi and qfi .",
    "it is interesting to note that the behavior of @xmath88 is identical to that of @xmath71 , as is apparent by comparing fig . 1 and 3 .",
    "besides , under the same condition @xmath89 both the fi and qfi obtain the maximum value when @xmath76 is fixed . in order to find out whether the population measurement is optimal during the estimation process of the unruh temperature , we will check whether the maximized fi is equal to the optimal qfi .",
    "thus , we prepare the detector in its ground state , i.e. , @xmath81 , and assume that the detector evolves for a long enough time .",
    "this allows us to easily find that the detector eventually evolves to a thermal state . in this case , the off - diagonal terms of state ( [ matrix for atom ] ) vanish and it is diagonal with two eigenvalues @xmath90 and corresponding eigenvectors @xmath91 and @xmath92 . for this quantum statistic model , we find that the fi is equal to the qfi given by @xmath93 it means that the estimation of @xmath76 via the population measurement is optimal .",
    "( [ fh ] ) is the ultimate bound to precision of estimation of the unruh temperature . because the population measurement is optimal , our results in this regard suggest that the achievement of the ultimate bound to precision of estimation of the unruh temperature allowed by quantum mechanics is in the capability of current technology .",
    "we introduced a detector , i.e. , a two - level atom , which is uniformly accelerated and interacts with a massless scalar field in the minkowski vacuum , and employ it to detect the unruh temperature . by employing local quantum estimation theory",
    "we have studied the estimation of the unruh temperature via quantum - limited measurements performed on the detector . in particular , we have analyzed the precision of estimation as a function of both the detector initial preparations and the interaction parameters , and evaluated the limits of precision posed by quantum mechanics .",
    "it is shown that the fi for the population measurement , which establishes a classical bound on precision , takes the maximum limit when the detector evolves for a long enough time compared with the time scale for atomic transition , @xmath63 , i.e. , when @xmath62 . in this case , the fi for population measurement is independent of any initial preparations of the detector .",
    "furthermore , we find that the same configuration is also corresponding to the maximum of the qfi based on all possible quantum measurements , which establishes the ultimate bound to the precision allowed by quantum mechanics .",
    "interestingly , the maximum fi is equal to the maximum qfi under the same conditions , which means the optimal measurement for the estimation of the unruh temperature corresponds to the population measurement .",
    "thus , during the detection of the unruh temperature , we can achieve the ultimate bound to the precision by performing a population measurement on the detector , and the ultimate bound is given by eq .",
    "( [ fh ] ) . because the population measurement is allowed by the current technology @xcite , our results , in this regard ,",
    "indicate that the ultimate bound to precision of estimation of unruh temperature imposed by quantum mechanics can in principle be achieved under the current technology . on the other hand ,",
    "our results demonstrate that thermalized quantum statistic model , eq .",
    "( [ thermal ] ) , plays an optimal role in the estimation of the unruh temperature .",
    "this occurs because we want to estimate a tiny quantity that carries information about thermal disorder .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect to find the maximum sensitivity in the predictions when the external environment , that is coupled with the detector , is mostly occupied by the unruh thermal particle , and the more the better .",
    "this condition corresponds to when @xmath62 , i.e. , when the detector state is thermalized .",
    "our model avoids two critical technical difficulties in the estimation of the unruh temperature : a physically unfeasible detection of global free mode in the full space @xcite and a non - analytical expression of qfi due to the boundary conditions of the moving cavity @xcite .",
    "recently , the open quantum system approach has been used to understand the hawking effect of black hole @xcite and gibbons - hawking effect of de sitter universe @xcite .",
    "thus , our above analysis can also be applied to discussing the estimation of hawking temperature and gibbons - hawking temperature .",
    "also we could turn to the estimation of other parameters , such as the atomic frequency and phase , analyzing what kind of role that the relativistic effects play in this metrology .",
    "in particular , the simulation of relativistically accelerating atoms in trapped ion systems and superconducting circuits has been studied in ref .",
    "the simulations proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite are precise analogues of the physical setting required here .",
    "our techniques could possibly be implemented during such simulations .",
    "usually , two main steps are contained in estimation process : at first we has to choose a measurement , and then , after collecting a sample of outcomes , we should find an estimator , i.e. , a function to process data and to infer the value of the quantity of interest .",
    "for a given measurement scheme , the mean square error @xmath94 $ ] of any estimator of the parameter , @xmath76 , is bounded by the cramr - rao inequality @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the number of identical measurements repeated and @xmath71 is the fi given by @xmath97 efficient estimators are those saturating the cramr - rao inequality . in order to obtain the ultimate bound to precision , i.e. , the smallest value of the parameter that can be discriminated , the optimization of fi is needed via a suitable choice of all its dependent parameters . from eqs .",
    "( [ elements ] ) and ( [ fi ] ) , the fi obviously depends on the detector initial state parameters and evolving time , and so on . in this regard ,",
    "let us note that the initial states of the detector and evolving time play an important role in this metrology process , which essentially determine the ultimate bound on precision .    on the other hand , we can also maximize the fi over all possible quantum measurements on the quantum system . by introducing the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) satisfying @xmath98 ,",
    "the fi of any quantum measurement is upper bounded by the so - called qfi given by @xmath99 here , it is interesting to note that the qfi does not depend on any measurements carried on the detector , indeed being obtained by maximizing over all possible measurements @xcite .",
    "further studies show that the detailed formula for the qfi is of @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 satisfy @xmath103 . the first term in eq . ( [ qfih ] )",
    "represents the classical fisher information whereas the second term contains the truly quantum contribution .",
    "therefore , it is natural to generalize the cramr - rao inequality ( [ qcr inequlity ] ) to its quantum version @xmath104 which shows the ultimate bound to the precision allowed by quantum mechanics for a given statistical model @xmath105 .    for a given quantum measurement , i.e. , a povm , eq .",

    "( [ qfih ] ) establishes the ultimate bound to the precision allowed by quantum mechanics .",
    "thus optimal quantum measurement for the estimation of @xmath76 corresponds to povm with a fi equal to the qfi , i.e. , those saturating inequality ( [ qcr ] ) . in our paper , we calculate the fi for the population measurement , i.e. , @xmath106 and @xmath107 with outcomes probabilities @xmath108 , tr[\\rho_\\beta|g\\rangle\\langle g|]\\}$ ] , performed on the detector , and maximize it over all the parameters it depends on . then we compare it with the qfi based on all possible quantum measurements to find out whether the population measurement is optimal and determinate the ultimate bound to the precision .",
