    "but for different crystal orientations of the si substrate , the dependence of the combined interface and bulk contributions on azimuthal angle will be different @xcite : for the ( 111 ) face , the second harmonic radiation depends on the angle as @xmath514 and @xmath518 ; for the ( 001 ) face , the dependence is @xmath514 and @xmath519 ; while for the ( 110 ) face , the dependence becomes @xmath514 , @xmath520 , and @xmath519 .",
    "therefore , from the azimuthal dependence of the shg signal it might be possible to distinguish the graphene cshg ( efish ) from the interface contributions , for example by putting graphene on top of different sio@xmath510/si structures , one with the ( 111 ) face of si normal to the interface and one with the ( 001 ) face normal .",
    "because of the same origin of cshg and efish in graphene , they would have the same angle dependence , so such experiments would not help to distinguish between these different contributions from graphene ; but for a heavily doped and high mobility graphene sample our calculations show that the cshg should dominate .",
    "perturbative analyses play a central role in nonlinear optics .",
    "even when the electrons in a material are treated as independent , and relaxation is only described phenomenologically , the calculated response tensors that relate the induced polarization or current to powers of the applied fields indicate the nonlinear optical effects that are allowed , and point to where resonances can lead to an interesting dependence on time and frequency",
    ". often more sophisticated models of the electron dynamics are required , and sometimes the perturbative framework itself is insufficient to address the physics of interest .",
    "but even then these kinds of perturbative treatments provide a starting point for more realistic calculations .    in this paper",
    "we have provided such a treatment of the nonlinear third order optical response of doped graphene , with the main goal of investigating the effects of phenomenological relaxation parameters , finite temperature , and laser pulse width on the induced currents .",
    "we focused on the contributions of optical transitions around the dirac points , where the widely used linear dispersion relation is a good approximation . by solving semiconductor bloch equations perturbatively , an analytic expression for general third order conductivities",
    "was obtained at zero temperature , taking different relaxation parameters for interband and intraband optical transitions .",
    "the nonlinear conductivities at finite temperature were obtained by an appropriate integration over the chemical potential .",
    "the conductivities show a complicated dependence on photon energy , chemical potential , and the relaxation parameters .    even with the inclusion of relaxation we found that the perturbative approach itself is problematic at vanishing chemical potential , as might be expected from a similar result in the semiclassical limit @xcite , except in the special case that either first- or third - order interband and intraband relaxation rates are set equal .",
    "the perturbative approach adopted is unproblematic for doped graphene at zero temperature , but is a concern at finite temperature , since thermal fluctuations always place some electrons or holes near the dirac points . yet",
    "numerical calculations of the full semiconductor bloch equations indicate that the contribution of such electrons to the full optical response is small , so this effect does not afflict our results .",
    "we discussed in detail different nonlinear effects , including third harmonic generation , kerr effects and two - photon absorption , two - color coherent current injection , parametric frequency conversion , and dc - current and -field induced second harmonic generation and difference frequency generation .",
    "the interband relaxation generally broadens and lowers the resonant peaks , while the intraband relaxation plays an important role in some of the effects , including two - color coherent current injection and the dc - current induced second order nonlinearities . at room temperature",
    "most of the resonant structures are smeared out .",
    "we also considered the response of graphene to laser pulses .",
    "the optical response depends in detail on the frequency width of the incident pulse and the frequency structure of the response tensors .",
    "the two natural limits are ( 1 ) when the frequency structure of the response coefficients is rather flat on the scale of the frequency width of the incident pulse , and the induced current follows the injecting pulses , and ( 2 ) when there are divergences in the response coefficients at frequencies close to the real axis , as for two - color coherent control , the a dynamics associated directly with the relaxation processes .",
    "comparison of our results with experiments is difficult , since in many of the reported experiments the graphene samples have not been characterized in the linear regime , and neither the relaxation parameters nor even the chemical potential have been identified .",
    "results for some nonlinear response coefficients , such as that describing the kerr effect , are predicted by our calculations to be so sensitive to these parameters that we can not hazard a comparison of theory to experiment . yet our results for third harmonic generation and parametric frequency conversion are insensitive enough to these parameters that we can conclude our results are about two orders of magnitude smaller than those extracted from experiments @xcite , even with the adoption of reasonable relaxation parameters .",
    "we speculated on the causes of this disagreement ; it is of course early days for both detailed experimental and theoretical studies of such nonlinear effects in graphene . but these disagreements may persist , and a long and difficult journey may be necessary to understand the details of the full nonlinear optical response of graphene . even so we can expect that , as in the study of the nonlinear optical response of other materials , the kind of perturbative calculation we have presented here will provide a useful port of embarkation , paving the way to a better physical insight in the complex nonlinear optical response of graphene .",
