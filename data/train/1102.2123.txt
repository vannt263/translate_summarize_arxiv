    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , will collide heavyions at unprecedented high energies , exceeding by a factor 30 the energy available at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the main objective of alice ( a large ion collider experiment )  @xcite , is to study matter under extreme conditions of energy density to gain a better understanding of the fundamental properties of the strong interaction . in particular",
    ", alice will explore the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , the state of deconfined matter predicted by qcd  @xcite .",
    "the medium formed in heavy - ion collisions can be best probed by hard scattered partons produced in 2@xmath42 qcd processes at the leading order ( lo ) including in the final state a hard direct photon ( compton scattering : q + g @xmath5+q and quark annihilation : q+@xmath6+g ) .",
    "on one hand , the 4-momentum of the scattered parton is modified while traversing the medium , and on the other hand , the scattered photon does not interact , thus providing a reference for the 4-momentum of the partner parton .",
    "hence , from the modification experienced by the hard scattered partons , measured though photon tagged jets , the medium properties can be inferred . in particular , since these hard scattering processes sample the entire collision volume , the final state hadronic observables provide a real tomographic probe of the medium  @xcite .",
    "several algorithms  @xcite have been developed to identify @xmath7-jet events in p ",
    "p and pb  pb collisions , demonstrating the feasibility of such measurements with the alice detectors .",
    "however , the jet identification remains challenging in the heavy - ion environment in particular for the energies @xmath8  gev where @xmath7-jet events are measurable in alice with sufficient statistics .",
    "an equivalent approach is to measure direct - photon  hadrons correlation  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we have first established the intrinsic properties ( @xmath9 ) of @xmath7-jet events expected in pp collisions at lhc energies .",
    "then we discuss the nucleus - nucleus ( aa ) collision case , in particular , we explore the possibility to select @xmath7-jet events as a function of their localization in the medium to validate the tomographic approach .",
    "at leading order perturbative qcd , a pair of hard - scattered partons emerges exactly back - to - back in the center of mass of the partonic system . due to the finite size of the proton",
    ", however , it was found that each of the colliding parton carries initial transverse momentum with respect to the colliding axis , originally described as `` intrinsic @xmath9 '' . beyond the leading order , initial and final state radiations ( isr / fsr ) will generate additional transverse momentum .",
    "therefore , the resulting total transverse momentum of the outgoing parton pair causes an acoplanar and a momentum imbalance , @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "it is measured as the net transverse momentum of the outgoing parton - pair @xmath11 .",
    "it is anticipated that medium effects will generate additional transverse momentum resulting in a broadening of @xmath9 .",
    "this transverse momentum broadening can be directly related to the transport parameter @xmath12 , which describes the transverse momentum transferred from the medium to the traversing parton  @xcite .    using the pythia event generator  @xcite ,",
    "we have established the collision energy dependence of @xmath10 from @xmath7-jet events , by taking available data from different experiments measurements  @xcite and extrapolate to the lhc energies .",
    "the dependence is @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    to study the dependence of @xmath10 with the transverse momentum of the hard scattering , we have generated @xmath7-jet and jet - jet events with pythia generator in different @xmath1 bins with collision energy 14  tev , within @xmath9 setting predicted above and isr / fsr on .",
    "the averaged @xmath16 versus the transverse momentum , shows a weakly linear dependence .",
    "the tomography measurement can be performed by selecting @xmath7-h pairs with different values of the parameter @xmath17 = -@xmath18 .",
    "this criteria can effectively control hadron emission from different regions of the medium and therefore extract the corresponding jet modification parameters  @xcite . to simulate the medium induced energy loss , we used the monte - carlo model qpythia  @xcite , which combines an energy loss mechanism  @xcite and a realistic description of the collision geometry  @xcite .",
    "the hijing  @xcite generator was used to simulate the underlying events of heavy - ion collisions and pythia to simulate pp collisions .",
    "three samples of @xmath7-jet events were generated with photon energy larger than 20  gev .",
    "a first sample of pp collisions at 5.5  tev generated with pythia provides the baseline .",
    "the second sample consists in similar events modified by qpythia merged with central collision events .",
    "the last sample is obtained by merging the pythia events and peripheral collision events .",
    "tagging events with a direct photon well identified  @xcite by the alice calorimeters and measuring the distribution of hadrons emitted oppositely to the photon as a function of @xmath17 , allows us to determinate the jet fragmentation function  @xcite .",
    "the underlying event is subtracted by correlating the isolated photon with charged hadrons emitted on the same side as the photon , in the azimuthal range @xmath19 . to quantify the medium modification , @xmath20",
    "is calculated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : iaa ] ) @xmath21 as the ratio of @xmath7-hadrons correlation distribution measured in aa and pp collisions .",
    "the expected enhancement at low @xmath17 and suppression at high @xmath17 for central collision is observed , whereas , @xmath20 is equal to 1 for peripheral collisions , where quenching effects are absent .        to illustrate the selectivity of the tomographic measurement , the length , l",
    ", the jet travels inside the medium is calculated .",
    "[ fig : qlch ] indicates that most high @xmath1 leading particles are preferentially produced at the surface ( small l ) , while low @xmath1 leading particles are produced inside the whole volume ( large l ) , which demonstrates the l dependence of of the @xmath7 tagged charged hadron production for 2 different @xmath17 regions .",
    "we have then studied the l dependence of the medium modification factor @xmath22 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : iaal ] ) by selecting different @xmath17 regions . for large @xmath17 particles ,",
    "an obvious suppression is observed , and the suppression is stronger with increasing the medium length . for small @xmath17 , the opposite behavior is obtained as an enhancement ( @xmath23  1 ) .",
    "this result implies that @xmath7-hadrons correlation could be used to probe volume versus surface emission by selecting @xmath7-jet events with different @xmath17 values .",
    "however such l dependence will be challenging to measure in the experiments .",
    "@xmath7+jet studies are widely recognized as a powerfull tool to characterize qgp .",
    "the `` @xmath7+jet tomography '' study will enable us to extract jet quenching parameters in different regions of the dense medium via measurement of the nuclear modification factor of @xmath7-hadrons correlation ."
