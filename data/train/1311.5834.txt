    "multiview video provides several views taken from different perspectives , whereby each view consists of a sequence of video frames ( pictures ) .",
    "multiview video with two marginally different views of a given scene can be displayed to give viewers the perception of depth and is therefore commonly referred to as three - dimensional ( 3d ) video or stereoscopic video  @xcite ; for brevity we use the term `` 3d video '' throughout .",
    "providing 3d video services over transport networks requires efficient video compression ( coding ) techniques and transport mechanisms to accommodate the large volume of video data from the two views on bandwidth limited transmission links .",
    "while efficient coding techniques for multiview video have been researched extensively in recent years  @xcite , the network transport of encoded 3d video is largely an open research problem .",
    "previous studies on 3d video transport have primarily focused on the network and transport layer protocols and file formats  @xcite .",
    "for instance ,  @xcite examine the extension of common transport protocols , such as the datagram congestion control protocol ( dccp ) , the stream control transmission protocol ( sctp ) , and the user datagram protocol ( udp ) to 3d streaming , while the use of two separate internet protocol ( ip ) channels for the delivery of multiview video is studied in  @xcite .",
    "another existing line of research has studied prioritization and selective transport mechanisms for multiview video  @xcite .    in this study , we examine the fundamental traffic and statistical multiplexing characteristics of the main existing approaches for representing and encoding 3d video for long ( 54,000 frames ) full hd ( @xmath0 ) 3d videos . more specifically ,",
    "we consider @xmath1 multiview video ( mv ) representation and encoding , which exploits the redundancies between the two views , @xmath2 frame sequential ( fs ) representation , which merges the two views to form a single sequence with twice the frame rate and applies conventional single - view encoding , and @xmath3 side - by - side ( sbs ) representation , which halves the horizontal resolution of the views and combines them to form a single frame sequence for single - view encoding .",
    "we find that the mv representation achieves the most efficient encoding , but generates high traffic variability , which makes statistical multiplexing more challenging . indeed , for small numbers of multiplexed streams ,",
    "the fs representation with conventional single - view coding has the same transmission bandwidth requirements as the mv representation with multiview coding .",
    "only when smoothing the mv traffic or multiplexing many streams can transport systems benefit from the more efficient mv encoding .    in order to support further research on the network transport of 3d video , we make all video traces  @xcite used in this study publicly available in the video trace library ` http://trace.eas.asu.edu ` . in particular ,",
    "video traffic modeling  @xcite requires video traces for model development and validation .",
    "thus , the traffic characteristics of 3d video covered in this study will support the nascent research area of 3d video traffic modeling  @xcite .",
    "similarly , video traffic management mechanisms for a wide range of networks , including wireless and optical networks , are built on the fundamental traffic and multiplexing characteristics of the encoded video traffic  @xcite .",
    "thus , the broad traffic and statistical multiplexing evaluations in this study provide a basis for the emerging research area on 3d video traffic management in transport networks  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we provide a brief overview of the main representation formats for multiview video  @xcite as well as the applicable encoding and streaming approaches .      with the full resolution multiview format , which we refer to as multiview ( mv ) format for brevity , each view @xmath4 ,",
    "is represented with the full resolution of the underlying spatial video format .",
    "for instance , the mv format for the full hd resolution of @xmath5 pixels consists of a sequence of @xmath5 pixel frames for each view @xmath6 .",
    "each view has the same frame rate as the underlying temporal video format .",
    "for example , for a video with a frame rate of @xmath7 frames / s , each view has a frame rate of @xmath7 frames / s .    with the frame sequential ( fs ) representation , the video frames of the @xmath8 views ( at the full spatial resolution ) are temporally multiplexed to form a single sequence of video frames with frame rate @xmath9 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath10 views , the video frames from the left and right views are interleaved in alternating fashion to form a single stream with frame rate @xmath11 .",
    "frame - compatible representation formats have been introduced to utilize the existing infrastructure and equipment for the transmission of stereoscopic two - view video  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 views are spatially sub - sampled and multiplexed to form a single sequence of video frames with the same temporal and spatial resolution as the underlying video format  @xcite . in the side - by - side ( sbs ) format , the left and right views",
    "are spatially sub - sampled in the horizontal direction and are then combined side - by - side . for instance , for the full hd format , the left and right views are sub - sampled to @xmath12 pixels .",
    "thus , when they are combined in the side - by - side format , they still occupy the full hd resolution for every frame",
    ". however , each frame contains the left and right views at only half the original horizontal resolution . in the top - and - bottom format ,",
    "the left and right views are sub - sampled in the vertical direction and combined in top - and - bottom ( above - below ) fashion .",
    "for other formats , we refer to  @xcite .",
    "we consider the side - by - side ( sbs ) representation format in our study , since it is one of the most widely used frame - compatible formats , e.g. , it is currently being deployed in japan to transmit 3d content for tv broadcasting over the bs11 satellite channel  @xcite .",
    "the major drawback of these frame - compatible formats is that the spatial sub - sampling requires interpolation ( and concomitant quality degradation ) to extract the left and right views at their original resolution .",
    "we now proceed to briefly introduce the compression approaches that can be applied to the representation formats outlined in the preceding subsection .",
    "building on the concept of inter - view prediction  @xcite , multiview video coding  @xcite exploits the redundancies across different views of the same scene ( in addition to the temporal and intra - view spatial redundancies exploited in single - view encoding ) .",
    "multiview video coding is applicable only to the multiview ( mv ) representation format since this is the only format to retain distinct sequences of video frames for the views . for the case of 3d video ,",
    "the recent official itu multiview video coding reference software , referred to as jmvc , first encodes the left view , and then predictively encodes the right view with respect to the encoded left view .    the frame sequential ( fs ) and side - by - side ( sbs ) representation formats present a single sequence of video frames to the encoder .",
    "thus , conventional single - view video encoders can be applied to the fs and sbs representations .",
    "we employ the state - of - the - art jsvm reference implementation  @xcite of the scalable video coding ( svc ) extension of the advanced video coding ( avc ) encoder in single - layer encoding mode .    for completeness , we briefly note that each view could also be encoded independently with a single - view encoder , which is referred to as simulcasting .",
    "while simulcasting has the advantage of low complexity , it does not exploit the redundancies between the views , resulting in low encoding efficiency  @xcite . a currently active research direction in multiview video encoding",
    "is asymmetric coding  @xcite , which encodes the left and right views with different properties , e.g. , different quantization scales . for other ongoing research directions in encoding ,",
    "we refer to the overviews in  @xcite .",
    "[ [ sbs - representation ] ] sbs representation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the @xmath10 views are integrated into one frame sequence with the spatial resolution and frame rate @xmath13 of the underlying video . for frame - by - frame transmission of a sequence with @xmath14 frames , frame @xmath15 , of size @xmath16 [ bytes ] is transmitted during one frame period of duration @xmath17 at a bit rate of @xmath18 [ bit / s ] .",
    "[ [ mv - representation ] ] mv representation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    there are a number of streaming options for the mv representation with @xmath8 views .",
    "first , the @xmath8 streams resulting from the multiview video encoding can be streamed individually .",
    "we let @xmath19 , denote the size [ bytes ] of the encoded video frame @xmath20 of view @xmath6 and note that @xmath21 [ bit / s ] is the corresponding bitrate .",
    "the mean frame size of the encoded view @xmath6 is @xmath22 and the corresponding average bit rate is @xmath23 .",
    "the variance of these frame sizes is @xmath24 ^ 2.\\ ] ] the coefficient of variation of the frame sizes of view @xmath6 [ unit free ] is the standard deviation of the frame sizes @xmath25 normalized by the mean frame size @xmath26 and is widely employed as a measure of the variability of the frame sizes , i.e. , the traffic bitrate variability .",
    "plotting the @xmath27 as a function of the quantization scale ( or equivalently , the average psnr video quality ) gives the bitrate variability - distortion ( vd ) curve  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath8 streams can be merged into one multiview stream .",
    "we consider two elementary merging options , namely sequential ( s ) merging and aggregation ( combining ) . with sequential merging",
    ", the @xmath14 frames of the @xmath8 views are temporally multiplexed in round - robin fashion , i.e. , first view 1 of frame 1 , followed by view 2 of frame 1 , @xmath28 , followed by view @xmath8 of frame 1 , followed by view 1 of frame 2 , and so on . from the perspective of the video transport system , each of these @xmath29 video frames ( pictures ) can be interpreted as a video frame to be transmitted . in this perspective , the average frame size of the resulting multiview stream is @xmath30 noting that this multiview stream has @xmath8 frames to be played back in each frame period of duration @xmath17 , the average bit rate of the multiview stream is @xmath31 the variance of the frame sizes of the sequentially ( s ) merged multiview stream is @xmath32 ^ 2\\ ] ] with the corresponding @xmath33 .",
    "with combining ( c ) , the @xmath8 encoded views corresponding to a given frame index @xmath20 are aggregated to form one _ multiview frame _ of size @xmath34 . for 3d",
    "video with @xmath10 , the pair of frames for a given frame index @xmath20 ( which corresponds to a given capture instant of the frame pair ) constitutes the multiview frame @xmath20 .",
    "note that the average size of the multiview frames is @xmath35 with @xmath36 given in ( [ eq : avg1 ] ) .",
    "further , note that these multiview frames have a rate of @xmath13 multiview frames / s ; thus , the average bit rate of the multiview stream resulting from aggregation is the same @xmath37 as given in ( [ barr : eqn ] ) .",
    "however , the variance of the sizes of the ( combined ) multiview frames is different from ( [ eq : stddev1 ] ) ; specifically , @xmath38 ^ 2\\ ] ] and @xmath39 .    [ [ fs - representation ] ] fs representation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    similar to the mv representation , the fs representation can be streamed sequentially ( s ) with the traffic characterizations given by ( [ eq : avg1])([eq : stddev1 ] ) . or , the @xmath8 encoded frames for a given frame index @xmath20 can be combined ( c ) , analogous to the aggregation of the mv representation , resulting in the frame size variance given by ( [ eq : stddev2 ] ) .",
    "[ [ frame - size - smoothing ] ] frame size smoothing + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the aggregate streaming approach combines all encoded video data for one frame period of playback duration @xmath17 [ s ] and transmits this data at a constant bitrate over the @xmath17 period .",
    "compared to the sequential streaming approach , the aggregate streaming approach thus performs smoothing across the @xmath8 views , i.e. , effectively smoothes the encoded video data over the duration of one frame period @xmath17 .",
    "this smoothing concept can be extended to multiple frame periods , such as a group of pictures ( gop ) of the encoder  @xcite . for gop smoothing with a gop length of @xmath40 frames ,",
    "the encoded views from @xmath40 frames are aggregated and streamed at a constant bitrate over the period @xmath41 [ s ] .",
    "in this section , we describe our evaluation set - up , including the employed 3d video sequences , the encoding set - up , and the video traffic and quality metrics .      for a thorough evaluation of the traffic characteristics , especially the traffic variability ,",
    "the publicly available , relatively short 3d video research sequences  @xcite are not well suited .",
    "therefore , we employ long 3d ( @xmath10 ) video sequences of @xmath42 frames each .",
    "that is , we employ 51,200 left - view frames ( pictures ) and 51,200 right - view frames ( pictures ) for each test video .",
    "we have conducted evaluations with _ monsters vs aliens _ and _ clash of the titans _ , which are computer - animated fiction movies , _",
    "alice in wonderland _ , which is a fantasy movie consisting of a mix of animated and real - life content , and",
    "_ imax space station _ , a documentary .",
    "all videos are in the full hd @xmath5 pixels format and have a frame rate of @xmath7 frames / s for each view .",
    "we encoded the multiview representation with the reference software jmvc ( version 8.3.1 ) .",
    "we encoded the fs and sbs representations with the broadly used h.264 svc video coding standard using the h.264 reference software jsvm ( version 9.19.10 )  @xcite in single - layer encoding mode .",
    "we set the gop length to @xmath43 frames for the mv and sbs encodings ; for the fs encodings we set @xmath44 so that all encodings have the same playback duration between intracoded ( i ) frames , i.e. , support the same random access granularity .",
    "we employ two different gop patterns : ( b1 ) with one bi - directionally predicted ( b ) frame between successive intracoded ( i ) and predictive encoded ( p ) frames , and ( b7 ) with seven b frames between successive i and p frames .",
    "we conducted encodings for the quantization parameter settings 24 , 28 , and 34 .",
    "we employ the peak signal to noise ratio ( psnr )  @xcite of the video luminance signal of a video frame @xmath15 , of a view @xmath45 , as the objective quality metric of video frame @xmath20 of view @xmath6 .",
    "we average these video frame psnr values over the @xmath29 video frames of a given video sequence to obtain the average psnr video quality . for the mv and fs representations ,",
    "the psnr evaluation is conducted over the full hd spatial resolution of each view of a given frame .",
    "we note that in the context of asymmetric 3d video coding  @xcite , the psnr values of the two views may be weighed unequally , depending on their relative scaling ( bit rate reduction )  @xcite .",
    "we do not consider asymmetric video coding in this study and weigh the psnr values of both views equally .",
    "for the sbs representation , we report for some encodings the psnr values from the comparison of the uncompressed sbs representation with the encoded ( compressed ) and subsequently decoded sbs representation as sbs without interpolation ( sbs - ni ) .",
    "we also report for all encodings the comparison of the original full hd left and right views with the video signal obtained after sbs representation , encoding , decoding , and subsequent interpolation back to full hd format as sbs with interpolation ( sbs - i ) . unless otherwise noted , the sbs results are for the sbs representation with interpolation .",
    "we employed the jsvm reference down - sampling with a sine - windowed sinc - function and the corresponding normative up - sampling using a set of 4-tap filters  @xcite .",
    "we plot the average psnr video quality [ db ] as a function of the average streaming bitrate @xmath37 [ bit / s ] to obtain the rd curve and the coefficient of variation of the frame sizes @xmath46 as a function of the average psnr video quality to obtain the vd curve .",
    "in this section we present the rd and vd characteristics for the examined 3d video representation formats .",
    "we briefly note that generally the encodings with one b frame between successive i and p frames follow the same trends as observed for the encodings with seven b frames ; the main difference is that the encodings with one b frame have slightly higher bitrates and slightly lower cov values , which are effects of the lower level of predictive encoding .",
    "[ res ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      we consider a single `` bufferless '' statistical multiplexer  @xcite which reveals the fundamental statistical multiplexing behaviors without introducing arbitrary parameters , such as buffer sizes , cross traffic , or multi - hop routing paths .",
    "specifically , we consider a link of transmission bitrate @xmath47 [ bit / s ] , preceded by a buffer of size @xmath48 [ bit ] , i.e. , the buffer holds as many bits as can be transmitted in one frame period of duration @xmath17 .",
    "we let @xmath49 denote the number of 3d video streams fed into the buffer .",
    "each of the @xmath49 streams in a given simulation is derived from the same encoded 3d video sequence ; whereby , each stream has its own starting frame that is drawn independently , uniformly , and randomly from the set @xmath50 $ ] . starting from the selected starting frame ,",
    "each of the @xmath49 videos places one encoded frame of the sbs representation ( multiview frame of the mv - c or fs - c representation ) into the multiplexer buffer in each frame period . if the number of bits placed in the buffer in a frame period exceeds @xmath48 , then there is loss .",
    "we count the number of lost bits to evaluate the information loss probability @xmath51  @xcite as the proportion of the number of lost bits to the number of bits placed in the multiplexer buffer .",
    "we conduct many independent replications of the stream multiplexing , each replication simulates the transmission of @xmath14 frames ( with `` wrap - around '' to the first frame when the end of the video is reached ) for each stream , and each replication has a new independent set of random starting frames for the @xmath49 streams .",
    "we conducted two types of evaluations .",
    "first , we determined the maximum number of streams @xmath52 that can be transmitted over the link with prescribed transmission bit rate @xmath53 , and 40 mb / s such that @xmath51 is less than a prescribed small @xmath54 .",
    "we terminated a simulation when the confidence interval for @xmath51 was less than 10  % of the corresponding sample mean .",
    "second , we estimated the minimum link capacity @xmath55 that accommodates a prescribed number of streams @xmath49 while keeping @xmath56 .",
    "for each @xmath55 estimate , we performed 500 runs , each consisting of 1000 independent video streaming simulations .",
    "we discuss in detail the representative results from this evaluation of @xmath55 for a given number of streams @xmath49 .",
    "the results for the evaluation of @xmath52 given a fixed link capacity @xmath47 indicate the same tendencies .",
    "we observe from figs .",
    "[ cminall](a ) , ( c ) , and ( e ) that for small numbers of multiplexed streams , namely @xmath57 and 16 streams for _ monsters vs aliens _ and _ alice in wonderland _ , as well as @xmath57 streams for _ imax space station _ , the mv and fs representations require essentially the same transmission bitrate .",
    "even though the mv representation and encoding has higher rd efficiency , i.e. , lower average bit rate for a given average psnr video quality , the higher mv traffic variability makes statistical multiplexing more challenging , requiring the same transmission bit rate as the less rd efficient fs representation ( which has lower traffic variability ) .",
    "we further observe from figs .",
    "[ cminall](a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) that increasing the statistical multiplexing effect by multiplexing more streams , reduces the effect of the traffic variability , and , as a result , reduces the required transmission bit rate @xmath55 for mv - c relative to fs - c .",
    "we observe from figs .",
    "[ cminall](b ) , ( d ) , and ( f ) that gop smoothing effectively reduces the mv traffic variability such that already for small numbers of multiplexed streams , i.e. , a weak statistical multiplexing effect , the required transmission bitrate for mv is less than that for fs .",
    "we have compared the traffic characteristics and fundamental statistical multiplexing behaviors of state - of - the - art multiview ( mv ) 3d video representation and encoding with the frame sequential ( fs ) and side - by - side ( sbs ) representations encoded with state - of - the - art single - view video encoding .",
    "we found that the sbs representation , which permits transmission of two - view video with the existing single - view infrastructure , incurs significant psnr quality degradations compared to the mv and fs representations due to the sub - sampling and interpolation involved with the sbs representation .",
    "we found that when transmitting small numbers of streams without traffic smoothing , the higher traffic variability of the mv encoding leads to the same transmission bitrate requirements as the less rd efficient fs representation with single - view coding .",
    "we further found that to reap the benefit of the more rd efficient mv representation and coding for network transport , traffic smoothing or the multiplexing of many streams in large transmission systems is required .",
    "there are many important directions for future research on the traffic characterization and efficient network transport of encoded 3d video , and generally multiview video .",
    "one direction is to develop and evaluate smoothing and scheduling mechanisms that consider a wider set of network and receiver constraints , such as limited receiver buffer or varying wireless link bitrates , or collaborate across several ongoing streams  @xcite .",
    "another avenue is to exploit network and client resources , such as caches or cooperating peer clients for efficient delivery of multiview video services . broadly speaking ,",
    "these effective transmission strategies are especially critical when relatively few video streams are multiplexed as , for instance , in access networks , e.g. ,  @xcite , and metro networks , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the challenges are especially pronounced in networking scenarios in support of applications with tight real - time constraints , such as gaming  @xcite and real - time conferencing and tele - immersion  @xcite .",

    "<S> the network transport of 3d video , which contains two views of a video scene , poses significant challenges due to the increased video data compared to conventional single - view video . addressing these challenges requires a thorough understanding of the traffic and multiplexing characteristics of the different representation formats of 3d video . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the average bitrate - distortion ( rd ) and bitrate variability - distortion ( vd ) characteristics of three main representation formats . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we compare multiview video ( mv ) representation and encoding , frame sequential ( fs ) representation , and side - by - side ( sbs ) representation , whereby conventional single - view encoding is employed for the fs and sbs representations . </S>",
    "<S> our results for long 3d videos in full hd format indicate that the mv representation and encoding achieves the highest rd efficiency , while exhibiting the highest bitrate variabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the impact of these bitrate variabilities on network transport through extensive statistical multiplexing simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when multiplexing a small number of streams , the mv and fs representations require the same bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> however , when multiplexing a large number of streams or smoothing traffic , the mv representation and encoding reduces the bandwidth requirement relative to the fs representation . </S>"
