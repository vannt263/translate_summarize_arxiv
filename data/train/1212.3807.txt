    "ecological and social systems are complex and adaptive , composed of diverse agents that are interconnected and interdependent @xcite .",
    "heterogeneity within these systems often drives the evolution and adaptability of the system components enabling them to withstand and recover from environmental perturbations .",
    "however , it is also heterogeneity that makes the appearance and short - term prosperity of over - consumers possible , which in turn can eventually lead to exhaustion of the common resources ( tragedy of the commons @xcite ) and consequent collapse of the entire population , also known as evolutionary suicide @xcite ) .",
    "elinor ostrom has focused on the question of avoiding the tragedy of the commons from the point of view of collective decision making in small fisheries @xcite .",
    "she observed that the mutually satisfactory and functioning institution of collective action could be developed in small communities where the possible resource over - consumption by each individual was immediately noticeable and punished , such as in water - monitoring systems instituted in spanish huertas , where each user was able to closely watch the other , and where punishment for stealing scarce water was instituted not only in monetary fines but also in public humiliation .",
    "this illustrates a first path to prevent the tragedy of the commons : infliction of punishment / tax for over - consumption , effectively selecting against over - consumers .",
    "for instance , ostrom cites as an example of a successful adaptive governance system rural villages in japan , where about 3 million hectares of forests and mountain meadows were successfully managed even until now in no small part because `` accounts were kept about who contributed to what to make sure no household evaded its responsibilities unnoticed .",
    "only illness , family tragedy , or the absence of able - bodied adults ... were recognized as excuses for getting out of collective labor ... but if there was no acceptable excuse , punishment was in order '' .",
    "another situation , when the tragedy was successfully avoided , is when the community introduces some kind of `` social currency '' , where an individual is rewarded for cooperation with social status @xcite .",
    "this is an example of a second approach to preventing the tragedy of the commons : bestowing reward / subsidy to under - consumers .",
    "the dynamics of trade - offs between personal and population good have been studied through classical game theory @xcite . however , many of the potentially relevant results have been obtained for largely homogeneous populations of players . in this paper",
    "we approach the question of preventing the tragedy of the commons through instituting punishment / reward systems in heterogeneous populations using two recently developed methods for studying evolving heterogeneous populations in equation - based models , namely adaptive dynamics @xcite and the reduction theorem for replicator equations @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first we give a derivation of a previously studied model , modified to incorporate the effects of a punishment / reward system on overall population survival .",
    "next , we describe different approaches for studying the effects of punishment and reward on population composition , namely , adaptive dynamics and the reduction theorem for replicator equations .",
    "then we apply the two techniques to a variety of punishment / reward structures , obtaining both analytical and numerical results for sample populations that differ in their initial composition with respect to over- and under- consumers .",
    "we end the paper with a reformulation of the obtained results in the context of the prisoner s dilemma , as well as with a comparison of the two modeling methods .",
    "in order to answer the questions posed in the introduction , we first turn to a modified version of a mathematical model of ` niche construction ' proposed by krakauer et al.@xcite , where a population of consumers @xmath0 interact with a collectively constructed ` niche ' , represented as a common dynamical carrying capacity @xmath1 . rather than restricting the model to a specific physical resource , we take the ` niche ' to be a generalized abstract ` resource ' , such as available nutrients , energy and other characteristics of the environment that may affect both the individuals survival and fecundity ( in case of financial systems , the resource could be an inter - convertible unit such as money ) that each individual can invest or subtract from the ` common good ' .",
    "different individuals can contribute to the common dynamical carrying capacity , or they can subtract from it at different rates . since sufficient reduction of the common ` carrying capacity ' can indeed lead to population collapse , this model allows to model effectively in a conceptual framework the question of the effects of over - consumption on the survival of the population ,    within the frameworks of the model , each individual is characterized by his or her own intrinsic value of resource consumption , denoted by parameter @xmath2 ; a set of consumers that are characterized by the same value of @xmath2 is referred to as @xmath2-clone .",
    "the total population of all consumers is @xmath3 if @xmath2 takes on discrete values and @xmath4 if @xmath2 is continuous , where @xmath5 denotes the range of possible values of parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the individuals @xmath6 grow according to a logistic growth function , where the carrying capacity is not constant but is a dynamic variable .",
    "each individual invests in resource restoration at a rate proportional to @xmath7 ; an individual is considered to be an over - consumer if @xmath8 . moreover ,",
    "each individual is punished or rewarded according to a general continuous function @xmath9 that directly affects the fitness of each consumer - producer such that each clone is immediately punished for over - consumption if @xmath8 or rewarded for under - consumption when @xmath10 .",
    "the dynamics of the resource is determined by a natural restoration rate @xmath11 and decay / loss rate @xmath12 .",
    "restoration process is accounted for by the term @xmath13 , where @xmath1 is restored both proportionally to each individual s investment , accounted for by parameter @xmath2 , and to the total amount of resource consumed by the entire population , represented by @xmath14 .",
    "this yields the following system of equations : @xmath15    the meaning of all the variables and parameters summarized in table [ tab : parameters meaning ] .",

    "several transitional regimes were identified with increasing parameter @xmath2 , ranging from sustainable coexistence with the common resource with ever decreasing domain of attraction to sustained oscillatory regimes to collapse due to exhaustion of the common resource .",

    "we will also investigate the degree of effectiveness of punishment depending on initial composition of the population with respect to parameter @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we will try to investigate the question of whether punishing those who over - consume or rewarding those who under - consume will yield better results .",
    "these questions will be addressed using two recently developed methods for modeling parametrically heterogeneous populations , namely , adaptive dynamics @xcite and reduction theorem for replicator equations @xcite .",
    "adaptive dynamics is a series of techniques that have been recently developed to address questions of system invasibility by rare ` mutant ' clones .",
    "the main focus of this method is in evaluating a `` mutant s '' ability to proliferate in an environment set by the ` resident ' population @xcite .",
    "we use this method to evaluate different punishment / reward functions and their efficiency in preventing the tragedy of the commons .",
    "it is worth noting that a more general theory of systems with inheritance , which allows studying the problem of ` external stability ' of a population of ` residents ' to invasion by a ` mutant ' population , has been developed in @xcite ; it was later published in english in @xcite .",

    ", the population goes through a series of transitional regimes from sustainable coexistence with the resource to oscillatory regime to eventually committing evolutionary suicide through decreasing the common carrying capacity to a level that can no longer support the population .",
    "we began by identifying analytical conditions leading to the possibility of sustainable coexistence with the common resource for a subset of cases using adaptive dynamics .",
    "this method allows to address the question of whether a mutant ( in our case , an individual with a higher value of @xmath2 ) can invade a homogeneous resident population of resource consumers .",
    "we evaluated the effectiveness of three types of punishment functions : moderate punishment , @xmath43 ; severe punishment , @xmath53 , where the parameter @xmath44 denotes the severity of implementation of punishment on individuals with the corresponding value of parameter @xmath2 , and function of the type @xmath60 , which allows to separate the influence of reward for under - consumption , primarily accounted for with parameter @xmath62 , and punishment for over - consumption , accounted for with parameter @xmath61 .",
    "we demonstrated that while moderate punishment / reward function can be effective in keeping off moderate over - consumers at sufficiently high values of @xmath44 ( see figures [ fig : trexp s1c1 blue graphs ] and [ fig : trexp s1c1 trajectories ] ) , the evolutionarily singular strategy in this case is unstable , and thus eventually the population will be invaded by over - consumers with large enough value of @xmath2 .",
    "the severe punishment / generous reward approach was uniformly effective , almost irrespective of the value of @xmath44 , and allowed invasion of moderate over consumers only in the small region of @xmath187 , when the punishment is not yet severe enough to outweigh the benefits of moderate over - consumption ( see figures [ fig : beta22 c2s1 blue ] and [ fig : beta22 c2s1 trajectories ] ) , and the reward does not yet provide sufficient payoffs in terms of higher growth rates .",
    "the evolutionarily singular strategy in this case is stable , suggesting that punishment is severe enough to prevent the tragedy of the commons .",
    "finally , we investigated a punishment / reward function of the type @xmath60 that allowed separating the influence of punishment for over - consumption ( parameter @xmath61 ) from that of rewarding under - consumption ( parameter @xmath62 ) .",
    "this functional type behaves as a moderate punishment / reward function for @xmath65 , rendering it effective only for moderate over - consumers , and it behaves like the severe punishment / reward function for @xmath66 ; in the critical case @xmath67 the outcome of the interactions between resident and invader populations is determined solely by relative values of growth rate parameter @xmath68 and parameter @xmath62 .",
    "our results suggest that just rewarding under - consumers is not enough to prevent invasion by over consumers and hence one should not expect to be able to prevent the tragedy of the commons through reward alone .",
    "adaptive dynamics techniques do not yet allow answering the question of system invasibility when the mutant is not rare , such as in cases of migration and consequent invasion by a group , or when the resident population is inhomogeneous .",
    "we address these questions using the reduction theorem for replicator equations .",
    "assume that each individual consumer is characterized by his or her own value of the intrinsic parameter @xmath2 ; a group of consumers with this value of @xmath2 is referred to here as @xmath2-clones .",
    "this trait directly affects fitness , and thus the distribution of clones will change over time due to system dynamics .",
    "the clones will experience selective pressures not only from the external environment , competing for the limited resource , but also from each other .",
    "consequently , the mean of the parameter will also change over time , affecting system dynamics .",
    "the mean of the parameter can be computed at each time point from the moment generating function of the initial distribution of clones , which allows to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of punishment / reward functions on population composition by tracking how the distribution of clones changed over time with respect to parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we evaluated the effectiveness of the same three types of punishment / reward functions on system evolution and calculated predicted the outcomes for different initial distributions of clones within the population , which were taken to be truncated exponential with parameter @xmath86 , and beta distribution with parameters @xmath90 and @xmath88 .",
    "the initial distributions were chosen in such a way as to give significantly different shapes of the initial probability density function ; in applications they should be matched to real data , when it is available .",
    "we observed that the intensity of implementation of punishment\\reward has to differ for different initial distributions if one is to successfully stop over - consumption , and so in order to be able to make any reasonable predictions one needs to understand what the initial composition of the affected population is .",
    "we hypothesized that the higher the frequency of over consumers in the initial population , the more severe the punishment for over - consumption would have to be , and the more generous the reward ; specifically , for our examples , we anticipated the prognosis to be the most favorable for initial truncated exponential distribution , followed by beta distribution with parameters @xmath88 and then finally @xmath90 .",
    "this effect additionally implies that the results obtained analytically from adaptive dynamics can only be relevant for a subset of cases , i.e. when the invader is rare .",
    "as anticipated , we observed that severe punishment / generous reward approach was much more effective in preventing the tragedy of the commons than the moderate punishment / reward function , particularly for the cases , when over - consumers were present at higher frequencies ( such as both beta initial distributions ) .",
    "specifically , we observed that the level of implementation , @xmath44 , could be nearly ten times lower for severe punishment / generous reward system as compared to the moderate punishment function ( @xmath188 vs @xmath189 ) in order to obtain the same effect of selecting against the over - consumers , which can be a very important factor in cases when there are large costs associated with implementation of such intervention systems .",
    "this comes not only from the severity of punishment but also from the fact that moderate punishment allows more time for the over - consumers to replicate , and thus by the time the punishment has an appreciable effect , the population composition had changed , and the moderate punishment will no longer be effective .",
    "so , in punishment implementation one needs to take into account not only the severity of punishment but also the time window that moderate punishment may provide , allowing over - consumers to proliferate . within the frameworks of the proposed model , moderate implementation of more severe punishment\\reward system",
    "is more effective than severe implementation of moderate punishment\\reward .",
    "proposed here is just one way to try and modify individuals payoffs in order to prevent resource over - consumption - through inflicting punishment and reward that affects the growth rates of clones directly .",
    "this approach can be modified depending on different situations , inflicting punishment or reward based not just on the intrinsic value of @xmath2 but on total resource currently available .",

    "the method allows to formulate analytical conditions , which can be conveniently visualized using pairwise invasibility plots ( pips ) .",

    "the common thread that runs through many of the available examples is that 1 ) in small groups the effects of over - consumption are immediately noticeable , since within a small population each individual s actions are more visible than in larger populations , and 2 ) punishment is enforced without delay .    in this paper",
    "we are dealing with a particular case of a game of prisoner s dilemma , where punishment / reward functions @xmath84 affect individual payoffs in such a way as to give the possibility to outweigh both the benefits of over - consumption and the deleterious effects of under - consumption ( see figure [ fig : prisoner s dilemma matrix-1 ] ) .",
    "we were able to demonstrate that preventing the tragedy of the commons through solely rewarding under - consumers is unlikely .",
