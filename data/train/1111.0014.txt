    "with the profusion of data provided in recent years by deep , large - area photometric surveys such as the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , a wealth of stellar substructure has been uncovered in the milky way ( mw ) halo .",
    "the finding and subsequent mapping of numerous stellar tidal streams and overdensities ( e.g. , sagittarius  @xcite ; monoceros  @xcite ; other sdss streams  @xcite ) has borne out the idea @xcite that remnants of accreted dwarf galaxies make up much of the stellar halo of the milky way .",
    "the direct confirmation of the accretion of late - infalling subhalos via discovery of ubiquitous long - lived , coherent tidal debris streams has provided strong constraints on models of small - scale hierarchical structure formation under the prevailing @xmath9-cold dark matter ( @xmath9cdm ) cosmology ( e.g. , @xcite ) . furthermore , because the tidal streams retain the kinematical signatures of the orbits of their progenitors ( i.e. , angular momentum and energy ) , stellar debris in the streams can be used as sensitive probes of the underlying galactic gravitational potential ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the best - known and _ only _ widely agreed - upon case of a presently visible dwarf galaxy undergoing tidal disruption in the milky way halo is the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) .",
    "the core of this galaxy was first discovered by @xcite in a kinematical study of the outer galactic bulge , with the first large - scale mapping of the sgr leading and trailing tidal arms done by @xcite using 2mass m - giant stars .",
    "various studies have reported the discovery of stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; a comprehensive summary of the earlier detections appears in @xcite ) or star clusters ( e.g. , pal 12 : @xcite ; whiting 1 : @xcite ; many clusters : @xcite ; a summary of sgr clusters appears in @xcite ) plausibly associated with debris from sgr , either trailing or leading it along its orbit .",
    "line - of - sight velocities ( i.e. , _ radial velocities _ , or rvs ) of sgr members have been determined at a few positions along the stream ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and , along with the spatial distribution of these stars , provide constraints on models of the sgr - milky way interaction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a comprehensive effort at modeling the sgr disruption constrained by all observations available after about a decade of study was done by @xcite , who were able to reproduce most extant data , but were unable to completely reconcile the apparent need for a prolate mw halo potential to produce the leading arm _ radial velocities _ on the one hand , and an oblate halo to match the _ positions _ of leading debris on the other .",
    "this contradiction has apparently been recently resolved by @xcite , who propose that the milky way might have a triaxial halo ; a comprehensive @xmath10-body model based on the best - fitting triaxial halo ( * ? ? ? * hereafter lm10 ) reasonably matches nearly all existing constraints ( spatial _ and _ kinematical ) of sgr tidal debris . the sagittarius dwarf and",
    "its tidal debris are thus proving to be an excellent laboratory for studying both the dynamics of tidally disrupting dwarf galaxies and star stream formation , as well as the shape and strength of the galactic gravitational potential that is the cause of this disruption .",
    "it is this model of to which we shall compare our data throughout this work .      to date",
    ", no systematic survey has addressed the tangential velocities ( derived from proper motions ) of the identified major galactic tidal streams .",
    "only a few studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) have published _ any _ proper motion results for major galactic substructures , and typically not at a level of precision that is useful for constraining dynamical models of tidal stream production and evolution . in an effort to detect and characterize halo substructures ,",
    "we have been working on a project to obtain full phase - space information ( positions and full 3-d space motions ) for individual stars in kapteyn s selected areas ( sas ; see @xcite for an overview of this project ) .",
    "the sky positions of the selected areas were chosen by jacobus @xcite to provide evenly spaced coverage for a systematic exploration of milky way structure .",
    "we have attempted to carry on at least part of this legacy by taking advantage of mt .",
    "wilson 60-inch telescope photographic plate material taken by kapteyn and collaborators @xcite for their survey to make up the first - epoch data of our survey ( in particular , near - equatorial fields at @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) .",
    "the distribution on the sky of those sas that make up our survey is shown in an aitoff projection in figure  [ fig : radec ] .",
    "some of the equatorial sa fields lie along the orbit of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( which is approximated by the blue , solid curve in figure  [ fig : radec ] )  it is a subset of these fields ( in particular , six fields along the trailing tidal tail ; see the right panel of figure  [ fig : radec ] ) that are the focus of the present work .      the positions of tidal debris that have been found over a large stretch of the sagittarius orbit place fairly strong constraints on the three - dimensional motions of the sgr dwarf .",
    "it is , however , important to confirm and refine the models by measuring space velocities of stream stars ( especially proper motions , which are difficult to measure for stars in distant galactic substructures ) . in the case of the sgr trailing tail , however , proper motions measured for debris stars are also rather sensitive to the sun s motion through the galaxy .",
    "this arises because much of the sagittarius trailing tidal tail is positioned at a roughly constant distance below the galactic plane , with the sgr orbital plane nearly coincidental with the galactic @xmath13 plane .",
    "coordinates , we are specifically referring to a right - handed cartesian frame centered on the galactic center , with @xmath14 positive in the direction from the sun to the galactic center , @xmath15 in the direction of the sun s motion through the galaxy , and @xmath16 upward out of the plane . assuming the sun is at @xmath17 kpc from the galactic center , this places the sun at @xmath18=(-8.0,0,0 ) kpc .",
    "the corresponding velocity components will be denoted ( @xmath19 , where the `` gc '' denotes velocities relative to the galactic rest frame . ]",
    "* hereafter  mlpp  ) noted that because of this orientation , longitudinal proper motions of sgr trailing debris located sufficiently far away from the south galactic pole contain virtually no contribution from sagittarius motions , and almost entirely reflect the solar motion .",
    "efforts to measure fundamental dynamical properties of the milky way , such as its rotation curve , @xmath20 , are complicated by our sun s own ( poorly known ) motion within the galaxy .",
    "measurements of @xmath3 , the galactic rotation speed at the solar circle ( the _ local standard of rest _",
    ", `` lsr '' ) , vary by 25% , despite many efforts at its determination . the value adopted by the iau in 1985 of @xmath3 = 220 km s@xmath4 ( see @xcite ) has long represented a reasonable approximation to existing measurements ( note , however , that prior to the 1985 iau adoption of @xmath21 = 220 km s@xmath4 , the 1964 iau general assembly adopted 250 km s@xmath4 ; see a listing of pre-1985 measurements of @xmath3 in @xcite ) .",
    "constraints taking into account the ellipticity of the disk have suggested the lsr velocity could be as low as @xmath2180 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "a similarly low value of @xmath22 km s@xmath4 was found by @xcite , who modified previous methods of determining the oort constants by including radial variations of gas density in their mass modeling of the galactic rotation curve .",
    "proper motions of galactic cepheids from @xmath23 @xcite yield a result of @xmath24 km s@xmath4 ( where @xmath25 is the distance from the sun to the galactic center ; the iau adopted value is @xmath26 kpc ) , in line with the iau standard . using re - reduced @xmath23 data @xcite with improved systematic errors , @xcite found @xmath27 km s@xmath4 based on thin - disk o - b5 stars .",
    "estimates based on absolute pms of galactic bulge stars in the field of view of globular cluster m4 using the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _",
    "yield @xmath28 km s@xmath4 @xcite and @xmath29 km s@xmath4 @xcite ( with both studies using data from the same @xmath30 observations ) .",
    "long - term @xmath31 monitoring of sgr a * , the radio source at the galactic center , led to a proper motion of sgr a * from which @xcite revised the lsr velocity upward to @xmath32 km s@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite combined stellar kinematics near the galactic center with the proper motion of sgr a * to derive @xmath33 km s@xmath4 .",
    "more recently , @xmath3 has been suggested to be even higher , @xmath34 km s@xmath4 , based on trigonometric parallaxes of galactic star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "reanalysis of these same data , including the sgr a * proper motion , by @xcite found a similar @xmath35 km s@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite provided constraints on the mw halo potential by analysing the gd-1 @xcite stellar stream , combining sdss photometry , usno - b+sdss proper motions ( see @xcite ) , and spectroscopy to obtain 6-d phase - space data over a large stretch of the stream , which they used to estimate @xmath36 km s@xmath4 ( though this result is made somewhat more uncertain due to a systematic dependence on the flattening of the disk+halo potential ) . finally , a combined estimate including many of the above results as priors finds a value of @xmath37 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "most of the estimates discussed here rely on the oort constants , and thus are dependent on our incomplete knowledge of @xmath25 . despite numerous attempts at determining the circular velocity at the solar circle ,",
    "this constant remains poorly constrained .",
    "it is clear that independent methods would be valuable to obtain alternative estimates of @xmath3 .",
    "here we use a new , independent method for ascertaining @xmath21 that has the advantage over most of the previously mentioned methods in that the results have virtually complete decoupling from an assumed value of @xmath25 . as discussed in",
    ", the trailing arm of the sagittarius tidal stellar stream is ideally placed to serve as an absolute velocity reference for the lsr . with an orbital pole of @xmath38 ,",
    "sgr is almost on a polar orbit , and the line of nodes of the intersection of the galactic midplane and the sgr debris plane is almost coincident with the galactic @xmath14 axis ( the axis containing the sun and galactic center ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : sgr_xyz ] , which shows the projection of sgr debris from the model onto the galactic @xmath13 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 planes . in the upper left panel ( the @xmath41 plane ) ,",
    "the sgr orbital plane is nearly face - on , while in the other two panels , few sgr debris points are seen more than @xmath42 kpc on either side of the @xmath13 plane ( i.e. , @xmath43 kpc for nearly all sgr debris ) .",
    "the motions of sgr stars _ within _ its ( virtually non - precessing ; @xcite ) debris plane , as observed from the lsr , are therefore almost entirely in the galactic @xmath44 and @xmath45 velocity components ( i.e. , in the @xmath46-@xmath47 plane ) , whereas @xmath48 motions of sgr tidal tail stars almost entirely reflect _ solar motion _",
    " i.e. , @xmath3 ( plus the sun s peculiar motion in @xmath48 , established to be in the range @xmath2 + 5 to + 12 km s@xmath4 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the sgr trailing tail is positioned fairly equidistantly from the galactic disk for a substantial fraction of its stretch across the southern mw hemisphere @xcite .",
    "this band of stars arcing almost directly `` beneath '' us within the @xmath46-@xmath47 plane ( see the upper panel of figure  [ fig : sgr_xyz ] ) provides a remarkable , stationary zero - point reference against which to make direct measurement of the solar motion _",
    "almost completely independent of the sun s distance from the gc .",
    "_    because of the fortuitous orientation of the sgr debris , the majority of @xmath3 motion ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) is seen in the proper motions of these stars , with the reflex solar motion almost entirely contained in the @xmath49b ) component for sgr trailing arm stars ( at least for those stream stars away from the south galactic pole ( sgp ) coordinate  discontinuity \" , where the @xmath49b ) of sgr stream stars switches sign ) . fig .  4 of shows the essence of the proposed experiment via measurement of @xmath49b ) for sgr trailing arm stars , which shows a trend with debris longitude ,",
    "@xmath50 was defined by @xcite as longitude in the sgr debris plane as seen from the sun ; @xmath51 at the present sgr position , and increases along the trailing tail . ] , that reflects the solar motion",
    ". in the region from @xmath52 , @xmath49b ) is nearly constant , because the motion of sgr debris contributes little to the @xmath48-component of velocity .",
    "thus accurate measurement of @xmath49b ) for sgr trailing tail stars along this stretch of the stream will provide a means of estimating @xmath3 with almost no dependence on @xmath25 .",
    "five of the kapteyn fields for which we have precise ( @xmath21 mas yr@xmath4 ) proper motions lie squarely on the sgr trailing arm in this @xmath50 range , and one other ( sa 92 ) is on the periphery of the stream . in section  [ nbodyresults.sec ] , we will use the mean sgr debris proper motions derived in four of these six fields to derive constraints on @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite presented one of the first studies of high - resolution spectroscopic metallicities derived for sgr debris .",
    "their work showed that m - giants along the sagittarius leading stream exhibit a significant metallicity gradient ( which had previously been suggested to be present over smaller separations from the sgr core based on photometric techniques ; e.g. , @xcite ) , decreasing from a mean [ fe / h ] = -0.4 in the core to @xmath53 between @xmath54 from the core ( i.e. , between @xmath55 ) , and to @xmath56 at @xmath57 from the main sgr body .",
    "such a population gradient along the stream likely arose due a strong metallicity gradient being present in the dsph before its tidal disruption ; thus the outer , more metal - poor populations were preferentially lost as tidal stripping progressed at earlier times relative to the more intermediate - age ( and higher metallicity ) populations remaining in the core ( a mechanism for this process has been demonstrated in the context of an @xmath58body model by ) .",
    "in addition , apparently some younger populations were formed even after sgr began disrupting .",
    "the existence of a population gradient has also been seen by @xcite , who found that the relative numbers of blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars to red clump ( rc , or red horizontal branch ) stars are much higher in a leading stream field than in the sgr core . since bhb stars arise in older , more metal - poor populations than the rc stars",
    ", this must indicate that the stripped population was made up of predominantly older , less - enriched stars than remain in the core today .",
    "@xcite extended the search for chemical evolutionary signatures to the trailing tail of sgr , observing a handful of stars selected from the 2mass m - giant catalogs of @xcite at high resolution in each of two fields at distances of @xmath59 and @xmath60 from the core .",
    "keller et al . combined the mean metallicities in these two fields with the [ fe / h ] = -0.4 result for the sgr core from @xcite , and derived a metallicity fit as a function of @xmath61 of @xmath62[fe / h ] = ( -2.4@xmath630.3 ) @xmath64 dex degree@xmath4 .",
    "this trend ( seen in their figure 4 ) also passes through the mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath65 -0.6 derived by @xcite in a narrow region centered at @xmath66 .    for consistency ,",
    "all of the data included in the @xcite study ( including those from @xcite and @xcite ) were derived from m giants , which are , however , biased toward metal - rich , and therefore relatively younger , stars . in the current study",
    ", we explore the metallicity in fields between @xmath67 from the sgr core along the trailing tail using predominantly main sequence stars .",
    "such stars near the main sequence turnoff are much less prone to metallicity biases than m giants , because msto stars are present in all stellar populations .",
    "an additional advantage of focusing on msto stars is that the number density of turnoff stars is much higher than both young , m giant tracers and older horizontal - branch stars ; this provides us a much larger sample with which to characterize the sgr trailing tail metallicity .",
    "older trailing debris populations have recently been studied by @xcite , who used sdss stripe 82 data to develop a new technique for estimating metallicity from photometric data where both rr lyrae variables and main - sequence stars from the same structure can be identified .",
    "their work found a constant [ fe / h ] = -1.20@xmath630.1 for sgr debris along much of the same region of the trailing tail we are studying . in section  5 we explore the sgr trailing tail metallicity based on our samples of predominantly msto stars .",
    "an important diagnostic of the star - formation timescale in a system is the @xmath68-element abundance ; the @xmath68 elements ( e.g. , mg , ca , ti ) are produced mainly in type ii supernovae ( sne ) , which are the evolutionary endpoints of massive stars that dominate the chemical evolution at early times . once type ia sne begin to occur , the [ @xmath68/fe ] ratio will decrease , because @xmath68-elements are less effectively produced by these supernova progenitors , while the overall metallicity , [ fe / h ] , will continue to increase .",
    "this produces a `` knee '' in the [ @xmath68/fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] diagram , which acts essentially as a chronometer for a given system , since the [ fe / h ] of the knee indicates the transition from snii - dominated evolution to snia contributions .",
    "this phenomenon has been seen in a number of dsph systems , which typically show lower [ @xmath68/fe ] at a given [ fe / h ] than galactic populations because of a slower enrichment ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also a recent review by @xcite ) .",
    "however , at the lowest metallicities , the [ @xmath68/fe ] of dsphs more closely resemble those of the mw halo .",
    "studies by @xcite and @xcite found the same underabundance of @xmath68-elements relative to the milky way for the core of the sagittarius dsph .",
    "this finding has been extended into the sgr trailing stream by @xcite , and into the leading arm by @xcite , with both studies using m - giants from the catalog of @xcite .",
    "however , m giants are biased to higher metallicity and more recently star - forming population(s ) of sgr , so a natural next step in understanding the evolution of the original , pre - disruption sgr dsph is to derive detailed abundances ( especially for s - process and @xmath68-elements ) for a significant sample of the more metal - poor , older stars populating the core or , more accessibly , in sgr s more nearby streams . in section  5",
    "we present relative mg abundances derived from our spectra .",
    "we show that the majority of confirmed old , metal - poor sgr stream members appear to have distinct mg abundances from those of the milky way stellar populations along the lines of sight probed .      here , we present data in six of the kapteyn s selected areas from our deep proper - motion survey @xcite . in these six fields intersecting the trailing tidal tail of the sgr system , we have augmented our proper - motion catalogs with follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "sgr debris has been identified from among the stars with measured radial velocities , and these sgr candidates are used to derive the mean three - dimensional kinematics and chemistry of the sgr trailing stream .    in section  [ photom_pm.sec ]",
    ", we briefly introduce the proper motion survey ( a more detailed discussion of the survey appears in @xcite ) , and discuss in depth the spectroscopic observations with the wiyn+hydra and mmt+hectospec multifiber instruments that yielded a total of @xmath69 radial velocities among proper motion - selected stars within the six fields of view .",
    "section  [ rv_meas.sec ] will detail the final selection of candidate sgr debris in each of our fields based on rv , proper motion , and color - magnitude selection .",
    "section  [ sgr_kinematics.sec ] presents maximum - likelihood estimates of the most precise proper motions ( @xmath70 mas yr@xmath4 per star , or @xmath71 mas yr@xmath4 mean for each field ) yet measured for sagittarius debris .",
    "these measured kinematics are compared to the models of @xcite , and found to agree rather well with the predictions for sgr debris motions .",
    "however , we follow in section  [ mw_constraints.sec ] with an analysis of the residual _ disagreement _ between our measurements and the models , or more accurately , we use the discrepancy to reassess the magnitude of the solar reflex motion , which is the dominant contributor to the proper motions in the direction of galactic longitude . we show that our proper motion data ( specifically , @xmath72b ) are inconsistent with the standard iau value of 220 km s@xmath4 for the local standard of rest motion at the @xmath73 level and favor a significantly higher value , consistent with several of the most recent @xmath21 studies using radio techniques . in section  [ sgr_abund.sec ]",
    "we apply a software pipeline designed to derive stellar abundances from low - resolution spectra to the numerous spectra we have obtained for this project . while the metallicities show a hint of a gradient among the metal - poor stars in our study consistent with previous work , we can not rule out a constant [ fe / h ] over the range of stream longitude covered .",
    "we also examine the relative magnesium and iron index strengths for information on @xmath68-abundance patterns of sgr debris .",
    "we find mg abundances of sgr members are typically lower at a given [ fe / h ] than field stars , consistent with the behavior seen in most mw dsphs .",
    "finally , section  [ summary.sec ] concludes with a brief summary of our work , and future avenues these data can be used to explore .",
    "the data discussed here are part of our ongoing deep proper - motion survey in a subset of kapteyn s selected areas ( @xcite ; @xcite ) at declinations of @xmath74 and @xmath75 . the survey as designed by @xcite consists of @xmath76 fields evenly spaced at @xmath77 intervals along strips of constant declination",
    "( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "a handful of our near - equatorial survey fields ( see the left panel of figure  [ fig : radec ] ) fall on or near the location of sgr trailing tidal debris as mapped by @xcite using m - giants from 2mass .",
    "the location of our fields relative to the models ( constrained by the majewski et al .",
    "data , among others ) of @xcite can be seen in the right panel of figure  [ fig : radec ] , which suggests that we can expect a significant contribution from sgr debris to the stellar populations along these lines of sight . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "we showed that faint ( @xmath48 or @xmath78 ) , blue ( @xmath79 or @xmath80 ) overdensities ( at colors and magnitudes consistent with the expected sgr main sequence turnoff ) in the color - magnitude diagrams of those sa fields intersecting the sgr orbital path also show clumping in the distributions of their proper motions ; these excesses and their clumping in proper motion space suggest that a distant , common - motion population , likely to be sgr tidal debris , is present in these fields . in this work",

    "in this study , we are discussing fields that are @xmath81 from the core of the sgr dsph , along its trailing stream .",
    "the positions of the sas in this study in the galactic cartesian @xmath13 plane are shown in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : sgr_xyz ] , overlaid atop simulated sgr debris from the model .",
    "of course , to place points on this figure for the sas requires an estimate of heliocentric distance . where needed throughout this work ,",
    "we use mean distances to sgr debris in each sa field estimated from the model debris along corresponding lines of sight .",
    "we have chosen to do this rather than measure sgr debris distances because ( a ) our data in most fields do nt reach much fainter than the main sequence turnoff of sgr , and ( b ) the expected line - of - sight depth of the sgr stream in this portion of the trailing tail is @xmath82 kpc , which `` smears '' the main sequence out by as much as @xmath7 magnitudes .",
    "both of these factors make isochrone fitting to derive distances rather unconstrained , so for all analysis requiring a distance estimate we adopt the mean model debris distances from at each position , with the line - of - sight depth of the stream in each field defining the uncertainty in the distance .",

    "the remaining photometric data for this survey ( for sas 71 and 117 ) are photographic and derived from the late epoch ( du pont 2.5-m telescope ) plates from which the proper motions were measured .",
    "calibration of the photographic magnitudes in the blue ( iiia - j+gg385 ) and visual ( iiia - f+gg495 ) passbands onto the standard johnson - cousins system was achieved using ccd photometry taken in 1997 - 1998 with the swope 1-m at las campanas observatory . however , that ubv ccd photometry only covers a small portion ( @xmath83 ) of each field , and is shallower than the magnitude limit of the photographic plates by 1 - 1.5 magnitudes for red stars , and @xmath84 magnitudes for blue stars , yielding poor photometric calibration ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , for sas 71 and 117 , those aspects of our analysis that rely on the photometry ( e.g. , spectroscopic target selection , photometric parallax distance estimates , and calibration of color - dependent systematics in the proper motions ) are subject to the uncertainties in calibration of the photographic photometry propagated by up to 0.05 magnitudes in the @xmath85 and @xmath48 photometry .",
    "details of the proper motion reductions appear in @xcite , so here we provide only an overview .",
    "for all of the near - equatorial ( @xmath86 ) selected areas in our study , proper motions are derived from plates taken with the mt .",
    "wilson 60-inch between 1909 - 1912 , combined with deliberately matched plates ( in approximate area and plate scale ) taken by s. majewski with the 2.5-m las campanas du pont telescope between 1996 - 1998 .",
    "all plates were digitized with the yale pds microdensitometer .",
    "most background qsos and galaxies are near the limiting magnitude of the proper motion catalogs derived from solely the mt .",
    "wilson and du pont plates ; therefore if we used only these data , the correction to an absolute proper motion frame would be determined by only a handful of poorly - measured faint objects . to extend the proper motion limiting magnitude beyond the limit imposed by the mt .",
    "wilson plates , we augmented the kapteyn survey data with measurements of plates from the first palomar observatory sky survey ( poss - i ) , which were taken in the early 1950s . these plates ,",
    "while of much coarser plate scale ( @xmath87 mm@xmath4 ; compare to @xmath88 mm@xmath4 for the du pont , and @xmath89 mm@xmath4 for the 60  ) , are deeper than the 60  plates , and provide a @xmath90-year baseline with both the mt .",
    "wilson plates _ and _ the du pont plates , allowing us to extend the limiting magnitude of the survey ( at least for the poss - i / du pont proper motion baseline ) to @xmath91 .",
    "in addition , for two of the sa fields in this study ( sas 71 and 94 ) we have included plates from the kitt peak national observatory mayall 4-meter telescope , taken at prime focus in the mid-1970s by a. sandage and in the mid-1990s by s. majewski .",

    "it was these apparent overdensities that guided our target selection for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "we began with spectroscopy from the hydra multifiber spectrograph on the wiyn 3.5-m telescope ; in most of the shallower fields of this survey , moderate - resolution spectra can be obtained with this instrument in a reasonable amount of observing time . for the deep fields ( and some of the shallower fields as well ) , we used another multi - object spectrograph , the hectospec instrument on the mmt 6.5-m , which allowed us to observe @xmath96 sgr stream candidates simultaneously per setup down to faint ( @xmath97 or @xmath98 ) magnitudes .",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction for each instrument separately below .",
    "targets for spectroscopic follow - up were selected to lie within the locus of the suspected sgr main sequence turnoff ( msto ) at faint ( @xmath97 or @xmath99 ) magnitudes and blue ( @xmath100 or @xmath101 ) colors .",
    "@xcite showed that the proper motions of these sgr msto candidates clump more tightly than those of the predominantly nearby m - dwarfs at red colors .",
    "the tight clumping in the proper motion vector point diagram ( vpd ) of stars in the msto feature was used to define a selection box in proper motion space which should contain any sgr debris that is present in each field , and eliminate a good fraction of unrelated stars of similar color and magnitude .",
    "care was taken not to be too stringent with either the proper motion or photometric criteria , to preserve as many potential sgr stars in the wings of the distributions as possible . because the quality and depth of the photometry and proper motions varies between fields , different candidate selection criteria were adopted for each field .    for wiyn+hydra observations , only stars brighter than 20th magnitude ( either @xmath48 or @xmath97 ,",
    "depending on whether a given field had sdss photometry ) were included in the multifiber setups , because fainter stars than this require rather long exposures with a 3.5-meter telescope to achieve adequate signal - to - noise for radial velocity measurement .",
    "after all available fibers were filled with msto candidates the remaining fibers were assigned to targets at relatively bright magnitudes ( @xmath102 ) that also reside within the vpd selection criteria ( i.e. , potential sgr rgb stars ) .",
    "stars fainter than 20th magnitude were targeted with the 6.5-meter mmt telescope , which easily reaches sgr msto candidates in these fields .",
    "spectroscopic data were obtained during a total of eight observing runs with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope between december 2002 and november 2008 .",

    "this spectral region was selected to include the h@xmath108 , mg triplet , na d , and h@xmath68 spectral features .",
    "typically 60 - 70 targets were placed on hydra fibers , with the remaining 15 - 20 fibers placed on blank sky regions to allow for accurate sky subtraction .",

    "we targeted a few bright radial velocity standards covering spectral types from f through early k ( both dwarfs and giants ) , each through multiple fibers , to yield multiple individual cross - correlation template spectra .",

    "the uncertainty depends on @xmath109 ( essentially magnitude ) for all stars from a single hydra pointing ; however , the varying exposure times between hydra setups and changing observing conditions mean that @xmath113 is not strictly a function of magnitude in our final catalogs .      to obtain spectra of fainter sgr msto candidates , we were granted three nights of queue - scheduled noao observing time on the mmt 6.5-m .",
    "a total of six observing configurations were observed with the 300-fiber hectospec multifiber spectrograph @xcite mounted at the f/5 focus of the mmt .",
    "targets were selected from among the apparent stellar overdensities of blue msto canidates at magnitudes too faint ( @xmath78 ) to be reasonably observed with wiyn+hydra , but using the same proper motion criteria used to choose hydra targets . in each of these configurations ,",
    "a few targets previously observed with hydra were included for a radial velocity consistency check , and any fibers unable to be filled with faint stars were assigned to brighter ( @xmath114 ) sgr rgb candidates .",
    "we used the 270 gpm grating , centered at @xmath26400  , to give a working wavelength range of 3700 - 9150    at a dispersion of @xmath21.21 @xmath103pix@xmath4 ( 4.85   resolution ) .",
    "this low resolution allows us to obtain adequate signal - to - noise ( @xmath115 per  ) spectra of stars as faint as @xmath116 to measure radial velocities in 3 - 4 hours of total exposure time .",
    "we observed two multifiber setups each in sas 71 and 94 , the two fields in this study that have 4-meter plates ( and thus deeper proper - motion catalogs ) .",
    "the rest of the time was devoted to one configuration each in sas 93 and 117 .",
    "each configuration had 200 - 230 targets assigned ( essentially as many as the fiber assignment software would allow ) , with the remainder designated as sky fibers .",
    "the sky fibers were chosen in areas with the nearest @xmath117 star at least 15@xmath118 away , distributed throughout the field so that a number of them would fall within each of the two ccd chips of the hectospec system . the number of exposures in each field , each exposure time , the number of stars with measured radial velocities , and the limiting magnitude of each spectroscopic field are given in table  [ tab : sgr_obs_tab ] .",
    "the hectospec data were reduced using an external version of the sao `` specroad '' reduction pipeline @xcite written by juan cabanela and called especroad .",
    "the pipeline automates many reduction steps , including bias - correction , flat - fielding , cosmic - ray rejection , fiber - to - fiber throughput adjustments , and sky subtraction .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed manually using sets of three combined henear calibration lamp exposures from each night of observing .",
    "we derived rvs using the iraf task fxcor to cross - correlate object spectra against fourteen template rv standard spectra of nine different stars ranging in spectral type from f through k. we first correlated the standard spectra against each other , and found that our measurements agree with published rvs to within 4.9 km s@xmath4 for all of these stars , with zero mean offset , and @xmath119 km s@xmath4 . to minimize the effects of noise for spectra with lower @xmath109 , the cross - correlation was restricted to the regions around the h@xmath68 , mg triplet , and h@xmath108 lines .",
    "each of the object spectra was cross - correlated against all 14 standards , and the mean rv from each of these 14 measurements was adopted as the final result . for the queue - scheduled hectospec observations , we relied on the queue to provide radial velocity standards .",
    "we were thus unable to obtain repeated exposures of the same rv standard stars to allow us to use the `` vogt method '' ( as described in section  [ wiyn_obs.sec ] ) to determine rv errors .",
    "instead , uncertainties were estimated as the standard deviation of the 14 independent rv measurements thus derived , and vary ( essentially as a function of @xmath109 ) from @xmath120 km s@xmath4 at @xmath12118.0 to @xmath215 km s@xmath4 at @xmath122 21.5 - 22 .    from repeat measures of a handful of stars , including multiple hydra or hectospec observations as well as",
    "many observed with both systems , we found mean systematic offsets of @xmath123 km s@xmath4 between observing runs ( including both hydra and hectospec data ) .",
    "these offsets were applied to all rvs from a given run to place all measurements on the same system as the dec .",
    "2007 wiyn+hydra velocities .",
    "we also note that because we selected most hectospec targets to be faint , blue objects with miniscule proper motions , a large number of obvious qsos and agn spectra appeared in our data .",
    "these were added to the samples of qsos and galaxies that provided the fixed absolute proper motion frame in each field , improving the zero points in these fields .",
    "we supplemented our database of radial velocities by matching our proper motion catalogs to the sdss spectroscopic database .",
    "the number of additional rvs contributed by sdss in each field is noted in table  [ tab : sgr_obs_tab ] .",
    "the majority of sdss stars are red , nearby m - dwarfs , so very few additional sagittarius candidates were contributed by the addition of these spectroscopic data .",
    "however , the handful of sgr stars that are present , as well as any other stars in common with our observations , were used for a consistency check . from the stars in common between sdss and our observations in sas 94 and 93",
    ", we find mean offsets of @xmath124 5 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the accuracies of sdss radial velocities are @xmath125 km s@xmath4 at @xmath126 , decreasing to @xmath127 km s@xmath4 at @xmath128 @xcite , so we choose not to offset the rvs .",
    "figure  [ fig : rvhist ] shows all measured velocities in each of the six survey fields ( the total number of stellar radial velocities in each field is given in table  [ tab : sgr_obs_tab ] ) in the galactocentric ( @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the measured heliocentric radial velocity .",
    "this calculation assumes a circular velocity of 220 km s@xmath4 at the solar circle , and solar peculiar motion of @xmath131 km s@xmath4 . ] ) frame . these consist of all rvs from wiyn+hydra , mmt+hectospec , and where available , sdss . where multiple measurements exist , the final catalog reflects the error - weighted mean radial velocity . in each of these fields ,",
    "a broad peak is seen at @xmath132 km s@xmath4 which is made up primarily of milky way stellar populations in these high - latitude fields .",
    "an additional velocity peak is evident in sas 71 , 94 , 93 , and 117 , well separated ( in all fields except sa 117 ) from the galactic distribution in each of these fields ; it is this additional peak we shall show to consist of mainly sagittarius trailing tidal debris .",
    "there is no readily apparent peak at lower @xmath129 values in sas 92 and 116  this arises for different reasons in the two cases .",
    "sa 116 is the field in which we have the fewest measured radial velocities , and even the stars for which we do have data are not optimally selected to find sgr debris . because of limitations on exposure times due to weather , the observed stars were all at relatively bright magnitudes ( @xmath133 ) , where only very few sgr red giants should be found .",
    "more spectra of stars at faint ( @xmath134 ) magnitudes and blue colors will be necessary to identify sgr debris among the sa 116 data . in sa 92 ,",
    "on the other hand , nearly twice as many spectra are available than in sa 116 , and mostly at relatively faint magnitudes .",
    "the paucity of obvious sgr debris in this field is because of the location of sa 92 on the periphery of the stream , where sgr stellar densities are rather low .",
    "there are a handful of stars at low ( @xmath135 km s@xmath4 ) velocities , but hardly enough candidates to assert that a clear sgr presence is indicated in sa 92 .",
    "to assess whether these apparent velocity overdensities are expected among galactic populations in each line of sight , we compared the radial velocity distributions to those from the besanon galaxy model @xcite . in each sa field , the model query was run five times to smooth out the finite sampling statistics in each individual model run .",
    "the five catalogs were concatenated , then for each kapteyn field the measured velocities were compared to the expected radial velocities of smooth galactic populations by scaling the summed besanon model to match the total number of stars in the broad peak in each rv histogram .",
    "this was done separately for `` bright '' and `` faint '' samples in each field , since stars in different magnitude ranges preferentially sample different galactic populations with different velocity distributions ( e.g. , `` faint '' blue galactic stars in the region of the cmd where sgr msto stars reside will be predominantly halo stars , and thus have a much higher velocity dispersion than stars of similar color , but much brighter magnitude , where thin / thick disk msto stars predominate ) .",
    "the resulting scaled model distributions are shown as grey filled histograms in figure  [ fig : sa7194_vhelhist ] for sas 71 and 94 , with the measured heliocentric radial velocities given as solid - lined histograms .",
    "the broad peak is reproduced well by the model populations , suggesting that ( a ) there are no large global velocity offsets present in our data , and ( b ) the prominent peaks are indeed due to foreground / background milky way stars .",
    "the additional peaks at @xmath136 km s@xmath4 ( sa 71 ) and @xmath137 km s@xmath4 ( sa 94 ) are clearly not due to any expected galactic populations along these lines of sight .",
    "similar histograms are shown for sas 93 and 117 in figure  [ fig : sa93117_vhelhist ] , which again clearly show that the broad , prominent peak in each field is made up of galactic populations , and the peaks at @xmath138 km s@xmath4 ( sa 93 ) and @xmath139 km s@xmath4 ( sa 117 ) are inconsistent with expected milky way velocities .",
    "note that the peak in sa 117 overlaps the wings of the galactic distribution , making it slightly more difficult to isolate bona fide sgr members in this field on the basis of radial velocities alone .",
    "finally , we performed the same examination in sas 92 and 116 , with the results shown in figure  [ fig : sa92116_vhelhist ] .",
    "nearly all of the velocities shown in sa 92 are from the sdss database , and are predominantly very red m - dwarfs .",
    "for this reason , the long tail of the rv distribution at negative velocities , which is due to thick disk and halo msto stars , is not well reproduced by our data set .",
    "there are a small number of stars at sgr - like velocities in figure  [ fig : sa92116_vhelhist ] , but these fall within the expected locus of mw stars , so we can not definitively say that sgr members are present among our sa 92 sample . in sa 116 ,",
    "no excess peak of measured rvs relative to the model predictions is apparent .",
    "this is not surprising given ( a ) the caveats in the first paragraph of this section regarding the data in sa 116 , and ( b ) the fact that the @xcite model predicts sgr debris in this field to have rvs of @xmath140 km s@xmath4 , overlapping the wings of the galactic distribution in this field",
    ". a handful of sgr members may thus be present among our velocities , but they are difficult to distinguish from the milky way halo stars by their rvs .    with rvs in hand , a next culling for sgr stream candidates was obtained by simply taking all stars within a generously defined range around the evident associated radial velocity peak .",
    "such a selection will include a few milky way interlopers , so we examined the samples thus selected to remove non - sgr stars .",
    "we first removed all stars with proper motions @xmath141 mas yr@xmath4 in either dimension ; such stars , if actually at the distance of the sgr trailing tail in this region of sky ( @xmath225 - 40 kpc ) , would have unreasonably large ( @xmath142 km s@xmath4 ) tangential velocities ( @xmath143 km s@xmath4 , where d is the distance in kpc and @xmath144 the proper motion in mas yr@xmath4 ) .",
    "faint , blue stars with proper motions of this magnitude must therefore be nearby ( foreground ) mw white dwarfs or metal - poor subdwarfs . after removing these stars ,",
    "we then examine the positions of all selected candidates in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "we reject faint stars that are well redward of the readily apparent sgr main sequence , and at brighter magnitudes , we remove only stars at positions obviously inconsistent with being sgr red giants or horizontal branch stars . in sa 93 ,",
    "a clear offset was visible between mean proper motions of bright ( @xmath145 ) sgr candidates and fainter ones , so we chose to keep only candidates at @xmath146 , on the assumption that the density of stream stars should be much greater at fainter magnitudes near the lower rgb and msto than along the upper rgb .",
    "this yields fewer total sgr candidates , but the ones that remain have much higher probability of being sgr members than do the brighter candidates .",
    "we now discuss how we pared down the samples of sgr candidates from the initial broad rv and proper motion selections in each field to the final , more securely - identified samples used for analysis . for brevity , we will show detailed examples for only two of the six fields in the study .",
    "the first of these is sa 94 , which is the `` best - case '' field in our study , because it has deep proper motions due to the availability of 4-meter plates in its data set . for comparison ,",
    "we follow the sa 94 discussion with details of sa 93 , which has a much shallower proper motion catalog than sa 94 , but also has high - quality sdss photometry .",
    "these two fields were chosen simply to give the reader an idea of the type and quality of the data included in this study , and the process we followed to select sgr candidates .",
    "figure  [ fig : sa94_cmd ] shows the sdss @xmath147 vs. @xmath97 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for sa 94 .",
    "the left panel shows all stars for which we have measured proper motions , with sdss - classified galaxies removed from the sample .",
    "on the right - hand side , open squares depict all stars observed spectroscopically to illustrate the candidate selection .",
    "the majority of spectroscopic targets in this deep proper - motion field were selected from the sgr msto feature of faint , blue stars , and observed with the large - aperture mmt 6.5-m telescope .",
    "the remaining targets are either ( a ) bright stars observed with wiyn+hydra , or ( b ) targets chosen to fill unused fibers after all possible msto candidates had been assigned .",
    "the final culled sample of sgr candidates ( based initially on rv selection , with further interactive proper - motion and cmd selection performed as discussed below ) is shown by the large , filled black squares .",
    "as expected , these concentrate at the sgr msto locus , with a handful of brighter stars having properties consistent with sgr membership as rgb or red clump stars .",
    "we have overlaid an isochrone from @xcite for an old ( 10 gyr ) , metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = -1.3 ) population at the expected distance ( d = 29.5 kpc ; @xcite ) of sgr debris in sa 94 ; the age and metallicity of this isochrone is chosen to match the sgr metal - poor population identified by @xcite , which should be the dominant contributor to debris in this portion of the trailing tail .",
    "the final set of sgr candidates in this field concentrate near this ridgeline ; most of the scatter about the isochrone is likely due to the @xmath635 kpc line - of - sight depth of the sgr stream as well as the intrinsic population dispersion in sgr .",
    "the proper motion vector point diagram ( vpd ) is displayed as figure  [ fig : sa94_vpd ] , with panels and symbols the same as in figure  [ fig : sa94_cmd ] .",
    "sgr candidates clump more tightly in the vpd than the overall population of spectroscopic targets , which is consistent with the notion that we are indeed measuring a distant , common - motion grouping of stars .    to further cull the sample",
    ", we turn to the reduced proper motion diagram ( rpmd ) .",
    "reduced proper motion , defined as @xmath148 log @xmath149 , where @xmath97 is the apparent magnitude and @xmath144 is the total proper motion in arcsec yr@xmath4 , compresses stars with common tangential velocity into coherent features in the rpmd .",
    "thus , a common - motion population should form a sequence in the rpmd , even if the population has a significant line - of - sight depth ( see @xcite , especially figure 4 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : sa94_rpmd ] we show such a diagram for sa 94 , with the same isochrone as in figure  [ fig : sa94_cmd ] , shifted to the measured tangential velocity of sa 94 sgr debris ( to be discussed in section  [ pm_meas.sec ] ) .",
    "after an initial calculation of the mean motion , candidates that were obviously inconsistent with a broadly - defined region ( @xmath1500.3 magnitudes in @xmath151 and/or @xmath100 ) about the ridgeline were manually removed from the sample .",
    "sa 94 is one of only two fields ( with sa 71 ) of the six in this study that have kpno 4-m plates , and thus have 1 - 1.5 magnitude deeper proper motions .",
    "furthermore , of those two , sa 94 has higher - quality photometry ( from sdss ) than the photographic magnitudes used for sa 71 .",
    "thus sa 94 is our best field in terms of overall data quality . to illustrate how a more typical field compares to the highest - quality sa 94 data , we show in figures  [ fig : sa93_cmd ] , [ fig : sa93_vpd ] , and [ fig : sa93_rpmd ] the same type of plots as in figures  [ fig : sa94_cmd ] , [ fig : sa94_vpd ] , and [ fig : sa94_rpmd ] , but for sa 93",
    "this field is located in a high stellar density region of the stream , as is sa 94 , but has shallower proper motion data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gr_cmd_vpd ] ) , providing far fewer sgr msto candidates for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "because the available proper - motion data do not sample the msto as robustly as in sa 94 , this field was given lower priority for spectroscopy , with only one relatively short mmt+hectospec configuration observed ( see table  [ tab : sgr_obs_tab ] ) .",
    "however , in this one hectospec setup , nearly all available @xmath152 sgr candidates satisfying the ( somewhat relaxed relative to sa 94 ) target selection criteria were observed .",
    "the overlaid @xcite isochrone for an old ( 10 gyr ) , metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = -1.3 ) population at the expected distance ( @xmath153 = 28 kpc ) of sgr debris in sa 93 ( blue curve in figure  [ fig : sa93_cmd ] ) is seemingly consistent with all but the brightest of the identified candidates .",
    "we have also overplotted ( dashed gray curve ) an older ( @xmath215.8 gyr ) , more metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = -1.7 ) isochrone with the same distance as the blue curve ; this curve passes through the positions of the bright , blue stars , suggesting that they may also be sgr members of an old horizontal - branch / asymptotic giant branch population .",
    "however , the msto of such an old population is beyond the magnitude limit of our proper - motion survey .",
    "the rpmd ( figure  [ fig : sa93_rpmd ] ) for sa 93 shows the same ridgeline as in the cmd , shifted by the final measured tangential velocity for the sgr candidates . because the uncertainty in the mean proper motion",
    "is much larger in this field than in sa 94 ( on the order of @xmath2100 km s@xmath4 in tangential velocity for sa 93 , compared to @xmath250 km s@xmath4 in sa 94 ) , it is difficult to conclude much from the rpmd .",
    "the benefits of the additional 4-meter plates in sas 94 and 71 are clearly illustrated by the relatively fewer identified sgr stream members in the shallower sa 93 field compared to the deeper data sets .",
    "zoomed - in versions of the vpds for sas 94 and 93 are given in figure  [ fig : sa9493_vpd_members ] , with error bars shown on all points to illustrate the quality of the proper - motion data ( note that the error bars on individual stars in each of the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : sa9493_vpd_members ] are of comparable size , in spite of the higher - quality proper motion data in sa 94 than in sa 93 , because the majority of sgr candidates in sa 94 are faint [ @xmath154 msto candidates , while sa 93 candidates are mostly @xmath155 magnitude brighter than this ) .",
    "as previously mentioned , a proper motion offset was seen between faint ( @xmath146 ) stars in sa 93 and brighter candidates ; we included only the faint ( @xmath146 ) stars in our proper motion measurement , because these are more likely to be true sgr members .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimate of the absolute proper motion of sgr debris in each field is represented by the large red asterisks , which have @xmath156 uncertainty smaller than the size of the point .      in summary ,",
    "the basic sgr candidate selection in each selected area began with a broad rv selection centered on the apparent sgr velocity peak ( e.g. , @xmath157 km s@xmath4 in sas 94 and 93 ) .",
    "this was followed by removing high proper motion stars ( @xmath158 mas yr@xmath4 in either dimension ) , which would have tangential velocities much greater than the milky way escape velocity if those stars were at the 25 - 40 kpc distances of sgr debris along the sa lines of sight .",
    "we then used our knowledge of the distance and metallicity expected for sgr debris in these fields to remove stars at faint magnitudes that are more than @xmath84 magnitudes from the expected color - magnitude and rpmd loci in each field ( note that in some cases we did not apply this at bright magnitudes , since there is considerable uncertainty about the exact cmd locus for sgr debris above the turnoff ) .",
    "we calculated mean proper motions from the selected stars , then iteratively removed outliers ( @xmath159 ) in proper motion .",
    "finally , we manually inspected the remaining candidates to remove any stars that were @xmath73 outliers from the identified sgr locus in _ all observables _ (",
    "i.e. , rv , @xmath100 color , magnitude , _ and _ proper motion ) .",
    "once sgr candidates were selected using color , magnitude , rv , proper motion , and rpmd criteria , the kinematical properties of sgr debris in each sa field were estimated using a maximum likelihood method ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the final measured radial velocities and velocity dispersions , along with uncertainties in these values , are given in table  [ tab : sgr_kinematics ] in both the heliocentric and galactocentric ( gsr ) frames .",
    "the estimates of the mean radial velocity ( in the gsr frame ) of sgr debris can be seen in the top panels of figure  [ fig : lambda_3dkinematics ] , which overlays our measurements atop the best - fitting debris model of @xcite .",
    "the colors in the figure were chosen to match those used by @xcite , who color - coded points along the stream according to the orbital passage on which they became unbound .",
    "gold points correspond to debris stripped during the two most recent perigalactic passages , and magenta during the previous two passages .",
    "this portion of the trailing tail has a well - constrained radial velocity trend , which was measured by @xcite and @xcite , and was one of the constraints on the @xcite models .",
    "sgr model trailing tail debris within @xmath160 of the position of each kapteyn line of sight is shown in the right - hand panels of figure  [ fig : lambda_3dkinematics ] as small open squares .",
    "this illustrates that not only do our measured radial velocities agree quite well with the model , but that the dispersion in each field appears to match the distribution of model points .",
    "however , we caution that the velocity dispersions we find ( see table  [ tab : sgr_kinematics ] ) are higher than those derived by @xcite and @xcite for the trailing tail .",
    "it is unclear whether the dispersion is truly intrinsically higher for sgr trailing tail msto populations we sampled than for the m giants previously studied , or whether our derived dispersions are inflated by the large measurement uncertainties for our rvs , velocity zero - point offsets between the many data sets we have combined , or milky way foreground / background contamination in our sgr candidate samples .",

    "iteratively @xmath229-clipped mean proper motions of these resampled sgr candidates were measured , and the mean proper motions used in an identical @xmath191 fitting routine to that described above .",
    "assuming that the contaminants in each sample are somewhat uniformly distributed in their kinematical quantities , this method should yield a statistically robust result for @xmath3 and its uncertainty ( due to both the intrinsic measurement errors and the mw contamination ) .",

    "we ran the @xmath191 fitting again , but this time including all three dimensions of the motion as constraints .",
    "the bootstrap analysis gave a result of @xmath233 km s@xmath4  a histogram of the bootstrap results is seen in the right panel of figure  [ fig : theta_hist ] .",
    "this mean value is lower by @xmath234 than the result using only @xmath182b ) .",
    "formally , this is a better fit than the one - dimensional result ( with uncertainty of 14 km s@xmath4 compared to an uncertainty of 23 km s@xmath4 from the fits using only longitudinal proper motions ) , but the two are consistent within their 1@xmath217 uncertainties .",
    "finally , we performed the same exercise using all three dimensions of sgr debris motions , but excluding the less reliable sa 71 field .",
    "the uncertain identification of sgr debris in sa 71 is likely the reason this field ( at @xmath222 ) is an outlier from the predicted kinematical trends in figures  [ fig : lambda_3dkinematics ] and [ fig : mul_varyvcirc ] .",
    "the bootstrap fit using only sas 94 , 93 , and 117 yields @xmath235 km s@xmath4 .",
    "this slightly higher value for @xmath3 suggests that ( as is evident in figures  [ fig : lambda_3dkinematics ] and [ fig : mul_varyvcirc ] ) the sgr candidates in sa 71 skew our results toward lower @xmath3 .    ultimately , we have derived three estimates of @xmath3  one based on a simple one - dimensional analysis ( using all four fields ) that gave @xmath236 km s@xmath4 , another based on three - dimensional data yielding @xmath237 km s@xmath4 , and a final 3-d result with sa 71 excluded , which gave @xmath238 km s@xmath4 .",
    "it is likely that the true result is somewhere between the two extremes ( 264 km s@xmath4 and 232 km s@xmath4 ) from our methods .",
    "we now repeat the @xmath10-body analysis described in section  [ nbody.sec ] two times , first taking @xmath239 km s@xmath4 as a constraint on the models , then again using @xmath240 km s@xmath4 . the resulting @xmath10-body model for the 264 km",
    "s@xmath4 case matches the angular position , distance , and radial velocity trends of the observed sgr tidal streams ( using all of the observational constraints included in the original model ) almost equally as well as did the lm10 model ( formally , @xmath241 for the @xmath242 km s@xmath4 model , compared to @xmath243 for the model ; see discussion in section 4.3 of ) .",
    "in addition , as demonstrated in the left panel of figure  [ sgrpm.fig ] the proper motion of the remnant core of the sgr dwarf in this revised model ( @xmath49b)@xmath244 mas yr@xmath4 , @xmath245 mas yr@xmath4 ) is a substantially better match to observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) than was the lm10 model .",
    "however , the @xmath10-body model in a milky way halo with @xmath246 km s@xmath4 fits equally well as does the 264 km s@xmath4 case , @xmath241 . for this model ,",
    "the sgr core proper motion ( seen in the right panel of figure  [ sgrpm.fig ] ) is intermediate between those of the model and the 264 km s@xmath4 result , as might be expected . in this case , the proper motions are discrepant with both the @xcite and @xcite results at the @xmath247 level . in the following subsection",
    "we discuss the ramifications of these @xmath3 results for the milky way halo .",
    "the results for @xmath3 from our analysis in the previous subsection suggest that the true value of @xmath3 as constrained by sgr trailing tail debris likely lies between 232 - 264 km s@xmath4 , but that more ( or more sensitive ) proper motion measurements of sgr trailing debris are needed to resolve this issue . in this subsection",
    ", we will discuss the implications of the @xmath3 constraints resulting from our two methods ; we remind the reader that the upper end of the range ( i.e. , the 264 km s@xmath4 result ) is less robustly determined than the results that produced lower values of the circular velocity .",
    "however , we include this value in our discussion to present the reader with the range of possible ramifications of what , in either case , represents an upward revision of @xmath3 from the accepted value .    the value of @xmath248 km s@xmath4 we found using all three dimensions of sgr debris kinematics is consistent with the canonical 220 km s@xmath4 value at the roughly 1@xmath217 level .",
    "however , this value is also consistent ( within the 1@xmath217 uncertainties ) with recent determinations of @xmath3 that have found the rotation speed to be higher than the standard 220 km s@xmath4 value [ e.g. , @xcite  @xmath249 km s@xmath4 ; @xcite  @xmath250 km s@xmath4 ] . for a change in @xmath3 of only about 10 km s@xmath4 ,",
    "it is difficult to make any conclusions about whether the additional mass required to increase the rotation speed must reside in the galactic halo or the disk / bulge . we note that placing the additional mass in the disk and bulge ( with the halo fixed ) yields @xmath252 and @xmath253 for the 232 km s@xmath4 model ",
    "an increase of @xmath254 over the disk and bulge mass from the model of .",
    "the relatively high value of @xmath255 km s@xmath4 found by our analysis using only the @xmath182b ) motions would require that the mass of the galactic bulge and disk components be increased by @xmath92 from the values assumed by to @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "this disk mass is near the peak of the probability distribution ( @xmath258 ) found by @xcite based on fitting the gd-1 stream in a three - component gravitational potential similar to our own .",
    "we caution however that the orbit of sgr is largely insensitive to the _ distribution _ of the excess mass between the two baryonic components , and solutions that yield similar @xmath191 can be found by ascribing all or part of the needed adjustment in @xmath3 to changes in the mass of either the disk or bulge components alone .",
    "we do note , however , that the relative fraction of the total disk+bulge mass in each component is constrained by the need to reproduce the shape of the observed milky way rotation curve interior to @xmath259 ( see figure [ rotcurve.fig ] ) .",
    "km s@xmath4 achieved via scaling the galactic bulge@xmath214disk , galactic disk alone , and galactic halo alone . included for comparison is the rotation curve of the original lm10 model ( solid black line ) normalized to @xmath186 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the vertical dotted line represents the location of the sun at @xmath215 kpc.,width=216 ]    the total mass of the milky way interior to 50 kpc in the 264 km s@xmath4 model is @xmath260 , similar to the value of @xmath198 in the model .",
    "since we have accounted for the increased @xmath242 km s@xmath4 by increasing the disk+bulge mass ( which is a relatively small component of the total virial mass ) , the mass of the milky way interior to 200 kpc is @xmath261 , similar to the value of @xmath262 derived by assuming that @xmath186 km s@xmath4 .",
    "we note that it was not possible to obtain a satisfactory model ( within our parameterization of the milky way components ; exploration of different dark halo models is beyond the scope of this work ) for the sgr stream by leaving both the bulge and disk masses fixed at their values and accounting for changes in @xmath3 by scaling the dark matter halo .",
    "the dark matter halo profile is characterized by the parameters @xmath263 and @xmath264 ( see eqn . 3 of ) , which describe the total mass normalization and radial scalelength of the halo respectively . since dark matter in the model contributes only 19% of the total centripetal acceleration in the solar neighborhood , @xmath263 must be scaled up drastically ( by a factor of @xmath265 in total halo mass ) to increase @xmath3 from 220 km s@xmath4 to 264 km s@xmath4 , and necessitates a large increase in the space velocity of sgr along its orbit ( to @xmath266 km s@xmath4 ) to produce a leading arm debris stream at an observed peak distance of @xmath267 kpc ( see figure 6 of ) .",
    "however , such a rapidly moving satellite model yields radial velocities along the tidal debris streams that are systematically discrepant from observations by @xmath268 km s@xmath4 .",
    "similarly , it is neither possible to obtain a satisfactory fit for larger @xmath3 values ( @xmath269 km s@xmath4 , for which the halo mass scaling problem is even more extreme ) , nor for much lower values ( @xmath270 km s@xmath4 , because the baryonic bulge+disk mass component alone require @xmath271 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "another possibility we considered was to again fix the baryonic mass ( i.e. , the bulge+disk component ) , but to a smaller value than the model , and allow the halo mass to vary . in particular , we attempted to fit a model with @xmath240 km s@xmath4 , but with the bulge+disk mass decreased by 10% from the values .",
    "even this small change in the baryonic mass required scaling up the dark matter halo mass by @xmath272% to keep @xmath240 km s@xmath4 . the best - fit @xmath10-body model in this case",
    "fit the sgr trailing - tail velocities , but was a poor fit to the leading arm sdss distances because of the increased speed of the sgr core necessitated by the much larger halo .",
    "this illustration highlights the large changes in the halo mass effected by even small changes in the baryonic mass or the lsr velocity when fitting to observational data on the sgr system .",
    "in fact , it is a testament to how well - constrained the sgr system is by the current observational data that we are unable to fit the data if we change the dark halo model substantially .    one possible way to construct an @xmath10-body model of the sgr dwarf that fits the observational data relatively well while dramatically changing @xmath3 is to adopt a galactic halo whose scalelength is a factor of @xmath273 shorter than commonly adopted ( from @xmath274 kpc in the lm10 model to @xmath275 kpc ) .",
    "however , the galactic rotation curve implied by such a short halo scalelength declines steeply outside the solar circle ( figure [ rotcurve.fig ] ) , in conflict with observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that it is not possible to satisfactorily model the sgr dwarf in a milky way model with the bulge and disk masses fixed at the values of @xmath276 , @xmath277 , and the milky way halo scaled to produce @xmath3 much higher than 220 km s@xmath4 .",
    "thus our ( and other recent ) suggestions that @xmath3 is due an upward revision implies that the disk and/or bulge components  but _ not _ the halo  of the milky way are more massive than previously thought .",
    "while the spectra in the selected areas were obtained primarily with kinematics in mind , they have sufficient resolution and , for a large fraction of stars , sufficient @xmath109 , to obtain information not only on metallicity but also abundance patterns .",
    "this allows us an independent estimate of abundance distributions that , while of lower precision than the echelle work of @xcite and @xcite , is derived for many sgr stars , and is less biased than those m - giant studies .",
    "metallicities were measured for all stars using a software pipeline entitled `` ez_spam '' ( easy stellar parameters and metallicities ) , details of which will appear in a forthcoming paper ( carlin et al . 2011 , _ in prep . _ ) .",
    "ez_spam relies on the well - understood and calibrated lick spectral indices ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to measure stellar properties from low - resolution spectra .",

    "the scatter is even larger in sa 71 ( at @xmath222 ) ; this may arise for a number of reasons .",

    "finally , we note that sa 71 has been shown by @xcite to contain a significant number of stars from the ' ' monoceros stream \" overdensity , which could contribute to the inflation of the metallicity dispersion in this field , though it is unlikely that many monoceros stars would lie within our sgr radial velocity criteria for this field . also shown in figure  [ fig : feh_lambda ]",

    "however , there is a hint of a shallow gradient , which we confirm by fitting a linear trend to the four good data points .",
    "this fit , overlaid as a dashed line in figure  [ fig : feh_lambda ] , is [ fe / h ] = -0.991@xmath630.003 - ( 0.0014@xmath630.0036 ) @xmath61 . while suggestive of a slight gradient , the slope given is also consistent with zero within the errors of the fit .",
    "this is not surprising considering that nearly all debris in the portion of the stream contained within this study is expected to have been stripped on the same pericentric passage of the sgr core , as evidenced by the fact that all of our fields overlap gold - colored debris in figure  [ fig : radec ] ( i.e. , debris that became unbound during the last two perigalactic passages ; see @xcite for more detail about the color scheme used ) .",
    "our measured metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath2 -1.2 for sgr trailing debris is @xmath283 dex more metal - poor than the result obtained by @xcite for trailing - tail m - giants .",

    "a more apt comparison for the mean metallicity of sgr debris in our sa fields is the work of @xcite , who used sdss stripe 82 data to develop a new technique for estimating metallicity from photometric data , which relies on combined information from both rr lyrae variables and main - sequence stars from the same structure .",

    "previous attempts to measure the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) of the sgr stream have suffered from both small number statistics and stellar tracers that have an inherent metallicity bias .",

    "in addition , the analysis was based on a relatively small sample ( about 7 dozen stars ) , nearly half of which are in the core of the sgr dsph .",
    "@xcite derived abundances of sgr m giants along the _ trailing _ tidal tail , from which they derived @xmath284[fe / h]@xmath285 between @xmath286 ( from 6 m giants ) , and @xmath284[fe / h]@xmath287 ( mean of 4 stars ) for debris even further along the trailing tail .",
    "the existence of a metallicity gradient among sgr stream m giants along both the trailing and leading tails was confirmed by @xcite , who combined their additional measurements of 5 stars at @xmath288 ( @xmath284[fe / h]@xmath289 ) and 6 stars at @xmath290 ( @xmath284[fe / h]@xmath291 ) with the chou et al . and monaco et al .",

    "blue horizontal branch stars ( bhbs ) are another easily - identified and rather unambiguous tracer of halo substructure that has been used to probe the sgr stream .",

    "although this result turns up metal - poor populations not seen in m giants , it is difficult to make conclusions about the overall mdf of the sgr stream or progenitor based on biased metallicity tracers such as bhb stars and m giants .",

    "the mdf we derive is significantly broader and extending to much more metal - poor stars than indicated by the biased , m giant studies ( shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : sgr_mdf ] as a black dashed histogram for the sgr core and green dot - dashed lines for the leading arm ) , encompassing both the m - giant and bhb results . a comparison of our mdf to the @xcite reconstruction of the sgr m - giant mdf from several gyr ago based on their core and leading - arm samples",
    "is given in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : sgr_mdf ] .",
    "clearly our sgr trailing - tail sample is lacking the metal - rich component seen in the present - day core , but shows a similar distribution to the metal - poor tail of the reconstructed mdf .",
    "additional metal - poor stars are present in our sample that are not seen in the m giant samples ; these are likely drawn from similar populations to those in the @xcite study .    obviously , as has been shown by chou et al . and others",
    ", the total mdf of the entire sgr system will include a higher contribution of metal - rich stars when the core is included , but we also expect more metal - poor stars from those parts of the tails with larger separation from the core than we explore .",
    "thus , while we can not yet accurately reconstruct the total mdf of the sgr system , at least we now have a better feel of the _ breadth _ of the sgr mdf from the data shown in figures  [ fig : feh_hist_sas ] and [ fig : sgr_mdf ] .",
    "comparison of the latter mdf with those of other mw dsphs ( summarized , e.g. , in @xcite ) shows sgr to be more typical of other mw satellites .",
    "in particular , the sgr mdf resembles even more that of the lmc ( as has been previously suggested by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , which has been argued to be a chemical analog to the sgr progenitor by @xcite and a morphological analog by @xcite .",
    "as shown in section  5.1 , we have identified metal - poor populations in ( at least ) four of the fields from our study , which explore a different segment of the stellar populations in the sgr stream than previous m - giant studies .",
    "we have observed stars in these fields only at low resolution , and thus can not do detailed element - by - element chemical analysis such as that enabled by high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "however , we can use the low - resolution lick indices to explore relative @xmath68-abundances for the stars in our study . specifically",
    ", we explore the relative mg abundances using the lick mg b index centered at 5160 - 5190  . calibrating the mg b index to an actual [ mg / fe ]",
    "abundance is difficult , because the strength of mg lines is highly sensitive to surface gravity , with some additional sensitivity to effective temperature and [ fe / h ] .",
    "disentangling these effects is difficult with low - resolution spectra , but we can still explore a subset of the stars in our samples in a way that is relatively free of the effects of surface gravity and temperature of individual stars . to do so , we select only blue ( @xmath300 , or @xmath301 ) stars , which should be mostly main - sequence dwarfs ( thus , with similar surface gravity ) , since no giants are found at such blue colors . furthermore , the temperature sensitivity of the mg line strength , which is already much smaller than the log @xmath97 sensitivity , is mitigated by concentrating on a limited color range . in figure",
    "[ fig : mgfe_feh ] we show a  pseudo-[mg / fe ] `` ratio , given as the logarithm of the ratio of the lick mg b index to the mean of all eight lick fe indices ( after transforming them to a common scale ) , for all of the blue stars in sas 71 , 94 , 93 , and 117 for which we have high enough signal - to - noise ( @xmath302 ) to precisely measure indices and [ fe / h ] .",
    "black points in this diagram are all stars with non - sgr radial velocities , while our samples of all stars with sgr - like rvs in each field are shown as colored points .",
    "it is readily apparent that the black ( mw ) points mostly occupy a different region of the diagram than the colored ( sgr ) dots , which suggests an intrinsic chemical difference between the populations ( though some overlap is expected , especially at low metallicities , where many mw halo stars likely resemble dsphs in their abundance patterns ) .",
    "indeed , the behavior seen in figure  [ fig : mgfe_feh ] is exactly that seen for many mw dsphs  for more metal - rich dsph stars , the mg ( or @xmath68 ) abundance is lower ( on average ) at a given [ fe / h ] than in the galactic populations , with the two populations converging at lower metallicities ( i.e. , at the ' ' knee \" in the dsph s distribution ) . among the more metal - rich ( and younger ) m - giant populations of the sgr stream ,",
    "there is some indication that the knee in [ @xmath68/fe ] occurs at -1.2 @xmath297 [ fe / h ] @xmath297 -1.0 @xcite , but this is difficult to assess because of the lack of m - giants at lower metallicity . thus the apparent convergence of sgr trailing tail [ mg / fe ] with the plateau seen in galactic stars at [ fe / h ] @xmath297",
    "-1.5 may be an extension of the same behavior seen in the m - giant studies .",
    "alternatively , since we ve already shown that the mean [ fe / h ] along the trailing tail differs between the m - giant sample of @xcite , who find [ fe / h ] @xmath2 -0.6 , and our result of [ fe / h ] @xmath2 -1.2 ( which is also consistent with the findings of @xcite ) , our study may be sampling a distinctly older , more metal - poor population of sgr debris than the m - giant tracers .",
    "further characterization of the @xmath68-element behavior along the sgr trailing tail would benefit from either a calibration of our mg b/@xmath303fe@xmath304 index onto [ mg / fe ] abundance or the identification of bona fide stream giant stars that are bright enough for echelle - resolution spectroscopic follow - up .",

    "however , there is a systematic disagreement in the @xmath49b ) proper motions ( with the exception of the somewhat problematical sa 71 field ) , which we use to assess refinements to the mass scale of the milky way ( particularly its disk and bulge components ) .",
    "while proper motions along the portion of the trailing tail in this study provide constraints on sgr tidal disruption models , the fortuitous orientation of the sgr plane also allows us to use the measured proper motions to derive the circular velocity at the solar circle ( or `` local standard of rest '' ) , @xmath3 . our first - order approximation using only the @xmath49b ) proper motions as constraints",
    "yields @xmath230 km s@xmath4 . from our measured 3-d kinematics",
    ", we find this fundamental milky way parameter to be @xmath248 km s@xmath4 , or @xmath181 higher than the iau standard value of 220 km s@xmath4 . when we remove sa 71 , a field in which it is more difficult to unambiguously identify sgr debris , from the sample we find @xmath235 km s@xmath4 .",
    "we suggest that the true value of @xmath3 lies somewhere between 232 - 264 km s@xmath4 , while noting that all three of these estimates are consistent with each other within their 1@xmath217 uncertainties .",
    "our general result that the circular velocity at the solar radius is higher than the iau standard of 220 km s@xmath4 agrees with the recent derivation of @xmath308 km s@xmath4 by @xcite using trigonometric parallaxes of star forming regions in the outer disk . the same maser data from the reid et al",
    ". study were reanalyzed by @xcite , and yield a result of 246 @xmath63 30 km s@xmath4 ( 244 @xmath63 13 km s@xmath4 if priors on the proper motion of sgr a * are included , and 236 @xmath63 11 km s@xmath4 if the additional contribution of orbital fitting to the gd-1 stellar stream is included ) . again , our independent result is consistent with these studies , and inconsistent with the iau accepted value of 220 km s@xmath4 for this fundamental constant at the 1 - 2@xmath217 level .",
    "identification of additional sgr candidates could increase the accuracy of our determination of @xmath3 , as could the addition of another epoch of accurate data to the proper motion measurements .",
    "we note that while @xcite argued that their measurement of 254 km s@xmath4 would imply an upward revision of the total milky way mass by a factor of @xmath309 ( to a mass similar to that of m31 ) , we have shown that this is not required to produce @xmath3 even higher than that of reid et al . scaling the milky way dark matter halo up in mass to a level that yields @xmath242 km s@xmath4 while simultaneously reproducing known leading arm debris requires the sgr core to have a high ( @xmath310 km s@xmath4 ) space velocity , resulting in rvs in the tidal streams that are discrepant by @xmath311 km s@xmath4 from measured values .",
    "instead , we show that because @xmath312 of the centripetal force at the location of the sun is contributed by mass in the galactic disk and bulge , an increase of @xmath92 in the mass of the disk+bulge accounts for the additional acceleration needed to produce 264 km s@xmath4 rotation at the solar circle , while contributing only a small ( @xmath313 ) increase to the total virial mass of the milky way . with the additional constraint on the disk+bulge mass provided by our measurement of @xmath3 ,",
    "we have found a satisfactory model of sgr disruption that matches all of the constraints used in fitting the model , while additionally predicting a proper motion for the sgr dwarf that is in much better agreement with observations than the model .",
    "stellar metallicities have been derived from the low - resolution spectra of sgr candidates , and the mean metallicity of sgr tidal debris derived in each field .",
    "we find that a constant [ fe / h ] = -1.15 is consistent with the observations of all four fields for which sgr members were reliably identified .",
    "however , a linear fit to these four data points suggests that a gradient of ( @xmath314 ) dex degree@xmath4 is also reasonable ( though this value is consistent with zero slope within the uncertainty ) , in line with previous findings ( e.g. , @xcite ) of a metallicity gradient among m - giants along both the leading and trailing tidal tails .",
    "the scatter of [ fe / h ] in each of the survey fields is @xmath1500.5 dex , which is typical of the stellar populations seen in the core of the sgr dsph ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we show the metallicity distribution function for the trailing tail that is free from the biases inherent in previous studies of the sgr mdf .",
    "we find that the mdf of trailing debris is similar to mdfs of typical classical milky way dwarf spheroidals .",
    "a `` pseudo-[mg / fe ] '' was measured based on the ratio of lick mg b and @xmath303fe@xmath304 indices ; the behavior of log ( mg b/@xmath303fe@xmath304 ) with [ fe / h ] for sgr main - sequence candidates is markedly different from galactic stars of similar photometric colors ( identified by radial velocity ) from among the same datasets .",
    "furthermore , the trend is similar to that typically seen for dsphs , in that [ mg / fe ] is deficient at a given [ fe / h ] for sgr stars relative to the milky way field populations , and converges to a `` knee '' in figure  [ fig : mgfe_feh ] at lower ( [ fe / h ] @xmath2 -1.5 ) metallicity .",
    "this is a lower [ fe / h ] than previously reported for sgr m giants , and may reflect a bias intrinsic to those earlier m - giant studies .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopic follow - up will be necessary to confirm this trend among the old , metal - poor populations of recently - stripped sgr debris .",
