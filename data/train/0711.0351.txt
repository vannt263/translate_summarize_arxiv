    "during the last decades , computers have become faster and faster , mainly due to advances in hardware miniaturization",
    ". however , there are physical limits to the possible extent of this miniaturization , and the closer one gets to these limits , the less robust and more error - prone the components become @xcite .",
    "it is estimated that the time when processor architects face these limitations is within the next decade @xcite .",
    "gates , the smallest components of any processor , can fail in ( at least ) two ways .",
    "the first is that they do not work at all .",
    "the second is that they work most of the time correctly , and fail sometimes .",
    "this type of errors is called `` soft errors '' by hardware engineers .",
    "we deal with faults of the second type .    in particular ,",
    "we consider the computational model of _ noisy formulas_. formulas are a special kind of circuits in which each gate has exactly one output wire .. ] we ask how much noise on the gates is tolerable , such that any function can still be computed by some formula with bounded - error .",
    "we will assume throughout that gates fail independently of each other .",
    "this question has been studied earlier . already in 1956",
    "von neumann discovered that reliable computation is possible with noisy 3-majority gates if each gate fails independently with probability less than @xmath3 @xcite . the first to prove an upper bound on the tolerable noise was pippenger @xcite .",
    "he proved that formulas with gates of fan - in at most @xmath4 , where each gate fails independently with probability at least @xmath5 , are not sufficient for universal computation ( i.e.  not all functions can be computed with bounded error ) .",
    "feder proved that this bound also applies to circuits @xcite .",
    "later , feder s bound was improved to @xmath6 by evans and schulman @xcite .",
    "for formulas with gates of fan - in @xmath4 and @xmath4 odd , evans and schulman @xcite proved the tight bound @xmath7 .",
    "tight here means that if all gates fail independently with the same fixed probability @xmath8 , then any function can be bounded - error computed , and if each gate fails with some probability at least @xmath9 ( which does not need to be the same for all gates ) , universal computation is not possible . for @xmath10 the threshold",
    "was first established by hajek and weller @xcite .",
    "however , so far it has not been possible to establish thresholds for gates with _ even _ fan - in ( or even prove their existence ) , as pointed out in @xcite . in particular , the most basic case of fan - in 2 , which is most commonly used , had been elusive .",
    "an intuitive argument why even fan - in is different is that for even fan - in threshold gates ( and in particular majority gates ) can never be `` balanced '' , in the sense that the number of inputs on which they are @xmath11 can not be the same as the number of inputs on which they are @xmath12 .",
    "evans and pippenger @xcite made some progress in this direction .",
    "first , they show that all functions can be computed by formulas with noisy nand - gates with fan - in 2 , if each nand - gate fails with probability exactly @xmath0 , for any @xmath13 .",
    "second , they show that with nand - gates alone this bound can not be improved ( they make some additional assumptions which we discuss below ) .",
    "this left open the question of what the bound is if we allow all 16 gates with fan - in 2 .",
    "we settle this question in this paper .    [ the : main ] assume @xmath14 .",
    "functions that are computable with bias @xmath15 by a formula in which all gates have fan - in at most 2 and fail independently with probability at least @xmath16 , depend on at most a constant number of input bits .    together with the first mentioned result from @xcite this gives the exact threshold for formulas with gates of fan - in 2 .",
    "it extends the second result from @xcite in the following ways : ( 1 ) we allow all gates of fan - in 2 , instead of only nand - gates .",
    "( 2 ) we prove that if the noise is exactly @xmath2 , then no universal bounded - error computation is possible .",
    "( 3 ) in contrast to our result , the upper bound in @xcite only applies to `` soft '' inputs .",
    "they show that gates with noise more than @xmath2 can not increase the bias .",
    "more precisely , if the inputs to the formula are noisy themselves and have bias at most @xmath17 , then the output of the formula can not have larger bias than @xmath15 .",
    "this left open the case where the input bits are not noisy and either @xmath12 or @xmath11 , which is the case we care about most .",
    "our argument shows that even with perfect inputs fault - tolerant computation is not possible for noise at least @xmath2 .    to prove theorem [ the : main ] we introduce a new technique , which is also applicable in the case of fan - in @xmath18 .",
    "we expect that it can be extended to other fan - in cases .",
    "we conjecture that our bound also holds for circuits .      for any function @xmath19",
    "we will choose an input bit @xmath20 which @xmath21 depends on , and fix all other bits such that @xmath21 still depends on @xmath20 .",
    "assume that @xmath21 is computed by a formula @xmath22 with noisy gates that fail independently with probability at least @xmath23 .",
    "then , for each gate in the formula @xmath22 with input wires @xmath24 and @xmath25 and output wire @xmath26 we can define @xmath27+\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{p}[a=0 \\mid x_i=1]$ ] and @xmath28-\\mathbb{p}[a=0 \\mid x_i=1]$ ] and analogously for @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the variable @xmath29 can be seen as the average probability of @xmath24 being @xmath12 .",
    "we call @xmath30 the _ bias _ of @xmath24 with respect to the two input settings @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    to prove our result one could attempt the following , which will turn out to not quite work ( but we then show how to fix that ) : for an @xmath0-noisy gate with fan - in @xmath18 , input wires @xmath24 , @xmath25 and output wire @xmath26 , we would like to show that if the noise @xmath0 is at least the threshold @xmath2 then for any @xmath33 there is some @xmath34 such that if @xmath35 then @xmath36 .",
    "further , it is easy to show that for any @xmath37 there is a function @xmath21 such that any formula computing @xmath21 has one input bit @xmath20 on which @xmath21 depends and the number of computation steps on any path from @xmath20 to the output bit is at least @xmath38 .",
    "hence , the bias can not be bounded away from zero for all @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "unfortunately , ( [ wrong ] ) is not always true .",
    "sometimes the bias can actually go up . , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , for which @xmath41 .",
    "] we use a more sophisticated approach , showing that the bias goes down `` on average '' : we define a _ potential function _",
    "@xmath42 , which is positive and bounded on @xmath43 $ ] . instead of showing ( [ wrong ] )",
    "we show that for any @xmath33 there is some @xmath44 such that if @xmath45 then @xmath46 then ( [ eq : main ] ) holds for @xmath47 .",
    "since @xmath42 is bounded , this implies that for any arbitrarily small constant @xmath33 the bias of any formula becomes @xmath48 after a constant number of computation steps .",
    "we can then proceed as above .",
    "we give the main proof in section [ sec : mainproof ] . in section [ sec :",
    "proof ] we prove ( [ eq : main ] ) , in the main lemma [ lem : bias ] .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] contains some remarks on our particular choice of @xmath42 .",
    "a _ circuit _ is composed of gates .",
    "each _ gate _ has a certain number of input wires , which is called the _ fan - in _ of the gate .",
    "the wires can take boolean values @xmath12 or @xmath11 .",
    "a gate computes an output bit as a boolean function of its input bits .",
    "formula _ is a particular type of circuit in which the gates are connected in a tree , with the output gate at the root and the input bits at the leaves . in particular",
    ", this means that each gate has exactly one output wire .    a ( perfect ) parity - gate with input bits @xmath49 and @xmath50 outputs @xmath12 if @xmath51 and @xmath11 otherwise . a ( perfect ) or - gate outputs @xmath12 if @xmath52 and @xmath11 otherwise .",
    "we call a gate _ @xmath0-noisy _ if it outputs the correct result with probability @xmath53 and with probability @xmath0 it outputs the opposite .",
    "we say that a formula @xmath22 with noisy gates computes the function @xmath21 with bias @xmath17 if for all @xmath54 , @xmath55 : @xmath56\\ge \\delta+ \\mathbb{p}[f(y)=0]$ ] . and",
    "@xmath57 are actually computed by the same @xmath22 . ]",
    "if @xmath21 can be computed with some bias @xmath17 we also say that @xmath21 is _ computable with bounded - error_.    a function @xmath58 _ depends _ on the @xmath59-th input bit @xmath20 if there is some setting of the other bits , such that flipping @xmath20 flips the function value . the number of bits that @xmath21 depends on is denoted by @xmath60 .    in a formula , we define the _ depth _ of a wire @xmath24 , denoted by @xmath61 , as the number of 2-input gates on a path from @xmath24 to the output wire . gates with fan - in @xmath11 are not counted .    for the definition of the quantities @xmath29 and @xmath30 for a wire @xmath24 we refer to section [ sec : outline ] .",

    "we establish inequality ( [ dpi ] ) in lemma [ lem : bias ] , from which the proof of the main theorem will follow relatively straightforwardly .",
    "the proof of this inequality is quite technical and so at first reading the reader might just want to read the statement of lemma [ lem : bias ] and then move immediately to section [ sec : mainproof ] , where we establish the main result . inequality ( [ dpi ] ) can also be checked with the help of a computer ( e.g. using mathematica @xcite ) , but in the remainder of this section we will prove it rigorously .",

    "( 4 ) we also need @xmath279 , because that makes @xmath280 for @xmath92 .",
    "the rest of the choices are not so binding .    however , a quadratic function alone is not enough . for ( [ taylor ] ) to be at least @xmath12 one also has constraints on higher derivatives of @xmath42 .",
