    "generalisations of the four - dimensional anti - self - dual yang - mills equations to dimensions greater than four were first written down by corrigan et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "the mathematical study of these equations was spurred by the article @xcite of donaldson and thomas , which sought high - dimensional analogues of low - dimensional gauge - theoretical topological invariants . in physics",
    ", these equations turned out to be naturally bps equations , and have in particular become important in compactifications of string , m- , and f - theory .",
    "they have also been used to construct topological field theories @xcite , whose dimensional reductions have found application both in the geometric langlands program @xcite and an analytic continuation of chern - simons theory @xcite .",
    "the most interesting dimensions seem to be 6 , 7 , and 8 , and the corresponding generalised anti - self - dual equations are respectively called the hermitian - yang - mills or donaldson - uhlenbeck - yau equations @xcite , the @xmath6-instanton equations @xcite , and the spin(7)-instanton equations @xcite .",
    "the first solutions were written down in euclidean space @xcite , but later it was realised that the equations make sense on any manifold , provided it is equipped with a @xmath3-structure for a suitable lie group @xmath3 .",
    "one requires @xmath7 in dimension 6 , @xmath8 in dimension 7 , and @xmath9 in dimension 8 .",
    "the choice @xmath10 is also suitable on an 8-dimensional almost - complex manifold , because an su(4)-structure lifts to a spin(7)-structure ; the spin(7)-instanton equations are sometimes called the su(4)-instanton equations in this context . for a recent discussion and more references , see for example @xcite",
    ".    most work on the generalised anti - self - dual yang - mills equations has restricted attention to integrable @xmath3-structures , that is , riemannian manifolds with holonomy group @xmath3 .",
    "however , if one is interested in string compactifications with fluxes @xcite one should consider instead non - integrable @xmath3-structures .",
    "the torsion of the @xmath3-structure , which measures the failure to be integrable , is in this context identified with a 3-form field in supergravity .    with this in mind",
    ", we have undertaken to study the spin(7)-instanton equations on 8-dimensional coset spaces with non - integrable @xmath3-structures .",
    "we have restricted most of our attention to nearly khler and calabi - yau torsion coset spaces ( both of which admit an almost complex structure ) .",
    "mathematically , these are quite natural choices : they are obtained by requiring that the torsion 3-form is the real part of a ( 3,0)-form or a ( 2,1)-form respectively .",
    "physically , nearly khler 6-manifolds are suitable for compactification of both romans massive supergravity @xcite and heterotic supergravity @xcite to @xmath11 , while the calabi - yau torsion condition is a necessary ( though not sufficient ) condition in compactifications of heterotic supergravity to 4-dimensional minkowski space @xcite .",
    "an outline of the rest of this article is as follows .",
    "section [ sec:2 ] contains an introduction to @xmath12-structures on @xmath13-manifolds , and includes a digression on torsion classes in the case @xmath14 . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we introduce the spin(7)-instanton equations , highlighting their relations with the torsionful yang - mills equations and with topological quantum field theories . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we describe how to construct @xmath3-invariant gauge fields on coset spaces @xmath1 .",
    "we then discuss in sections [ sec:5]-[sec:8 ] the spin(7)-instanton equations on many examples of compact 8-manifolds of the form @xmath15 . in each example , we first impose @xmath3-invariance on the gauge field , reducing the 8-dimensional spin(7)-instanton equations to equations on the torus @xmath16 . where possible , these @xmath17-dimensional equation are solved . besides solutions on the torus , solutions on decompactified spaces @xmath18 are also considered .",
    "we summarise our results and make some closing comments in section [ sec:9 ] .",
    "a manifold with @xmath19-structure is by definition an @xmath20-dimensional manifold @xmath2 whose tangent bundle @xmath21 admits a reduction of its structure group from @xmath22 to @xmath19 . manifolds of dimension @xmath13 with su(@xmath23)-structure admit a set of canonical objects , consisting of an almost complex structure @xmath24 , a riemannian metric @xmath25 , a real two - form @xmath26 and a complex @xmath23-form @xmath27 . with respect to @xmath24 , the forms @xmath26 and @xmath27 are of type ( 1,1 ) and ( @xmath23,0 ) , respectively , and there is a compatibility condition , @xmath28 .",
    "with respect to the volume form @xmath29 of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are normalised so that @xmath30 let @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , be a local frame for the cotangent bundle , and let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be local frames for the ( 1,0 ) and ( 0,1 ) parts of the complexified cotangent bundle .",
    "then @xmath35 may be written as follows : @xmath36    one may choose a connection which preserves @xmath25 , @xmath24 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the case where the torsion of this connection is totally anti - symmetric , so that the cartan structure equations may be written @xmath39 here @xmath40 encodes the christoffel symbols of the connection : it is a traceless anti - hermitian matrix with 1-form entries .",
    "the 3-form @xmath41 is the torsion of the connection , while the symbol @xmath42 denotes contraction , defined in terms of the hodge star by @xmath43 .",
    "two particularly interesting cases arise when the torsion @xmath41 is the real part of either a ( 3,0)-form or a ( 2,1)-form . in the former case , the manifold is called nearly khler @xcite .",
    "the latter case is equivalent to a property called calabi - yau torsion @xcite , or cyt , as we now explain .    on a hermitian manifold ,",
    "the khler - torsion ( or bismut ) connection is a unitary connection @xmath44 on the cotangent bundle with anti - symmetric torsion given by @xmath45 ( where @xmath24 acts on the 3-forms according to the rule @xmath46 ) .",
    "a hermitian manifold is called cyt when the khler - torsion ( kt ) connection has structure group su(@xmath23 ) rather than u(@xmath23 ) ( so that @xmath44 is traceless as well as anti - hermitian ) .",
    "now suppose that the torsion @xmath41 of an su(@xmath23)-structure on some @xmath13-manifold is the real part of a ( 2,1)-form .",
    "the right hand side of ( [ cartan ] ) contains no part of type ( 0,2 ) .",
    "this immediately tells us that the almost complex structure @xmath24 is integrable , and the manifold is hermitian . writing @xmath47 and using the cartan structure equation ( [ cartan ] ) and the anti - hermiticity of @xmath40 , one can show that @xmath48 thus the khler - torsion connection @xmath44 and the connection @xmath40 preserving the su(@xmath23)-structure have the same torsion @xmath49 .",
    "so these two connections must agree , and the manifold is cyt .",
    "now we restrict attention to the case of 6-manifolds with su(3)-structure .",
    "chiossi and salamon have provided a classification of su(3)-structures in terms of intrinsic torsion classes @xcite .",
    "here we explain how nearly khler manifolds and cyt manifolds fit into this classification .",
    "the five torsion classes can be determined by analysing either the torsion tensor or the exterior derivatives of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "here we follow the latter approach : the torsion classes are defined by @xmath50 here @xmath51 are real functions , @xmath52 are real 1-forms , @xmath53 are the real and imaginary parts of a ( 1,1)-form with @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the real part of a ( 2,1)-form with @xmath56 .",
    "the torsion classes of a nearly khler manifold are already well - known . since the space of ( 3,0)-forms is 1-dimensional , one can write @xmath57 for some complex function @xmath58 . using ( [ cartan ] ) one can calculate @xmath59 comparing with ( [ torsion classes 1 ] ) , ( [ torsion classes 2 ] ) , one sees that @xmath60 for a nearly khler 6-manifold .",
    "the torsion classes for cyt manifolds can be derived similarly ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "since the complex structure @xmath24 is integrable , @xmath61 is a ( 3,1)-form and the torsion classes @xmath62 and @xmath63 vanish .",
    "let @xmath64 denote the kt connection , with torsion @xmath65 .",
    "then @xmath64 is a hermitian matrix with 1-form entries and @xmath66 satisfy the cartan structure equations ( [ cartan ] ) .",
    "the manifold will be cyt if and only if @xmath44 is traceless .",
    "one may calculate @xmath67 as follows : @xmath68 we recall that @xmath69 and @xmath70 are determined by @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "so @xmath44 is traceless if and only if @xmath73 .",
    "therefore a cyt manifold satisfies @xmath74 the cyt property does not place any restriction on @xmath55 .",
    "a spin(7)-structure on an 8-manifold is specified by a self - dual 4-form @xmath75 satisfying certain conditions . given any su(4)-structure on an 8-manifold , there is an @xmath76s - worth of compatible spin(7)-structures , determined by @xmath77 with @xmath78 a real parameter .",
    "conversely , given such a spin(7)-structure , the space of compatible su(4)-structures is @xmath79 .",
    "a natural generalisation of the 4-dimensional anti - self - dual yang - mills equation to an 8-dimensional manifold with spin(7)-structure is the @xmath75-anti - self - dual equation : @xmath80 when the spin(7)-structure is determined by an su(4)-structure via ( [ spin(7 ) ] ) , the equations can be written @xcite : @xmath81 here we have written the field strength tensor @xmath82 in a basis of ( 1,0)- and ( 0,1)-forms :",
    "@xmath83 anti - hermiticity of @xmath82 implies that @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "note that the spin(7)-instanton equations are weaker than the hermitian - yang - mills equations : @xmath86 any solution of the hermitian - yang - mills equations is automatically a solution of the spin(7)-instanton equations .",
    "we will sometimes need to be able to determine whether two su(4)-structures are compatible with the same fixed spin(7)-structure .",
    "the ( 1,1)-form @xmath87 of a compatible su(4)-structure should satisfy @xmath88 the space of solutions to this equation is 7-dimensional , so the space of normalised solutions is @xmath89 .",
    "any solution @xmath90 of ( [ sigma sd ] ) is a linear sum of @xmath26 and a solution @xmath91 of the complex self - dual equation : @xmath92      taking the exterior derivative of the @xmath75-anti - self - dual equation ( [ sigmaasd ] ) and using the bianchi identity gives @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the covariant derivative and @xmath95 is hodge dual to a torsion 3-form .",
    "the torsionful yang - mills equation ( [ ymetorsion ] ) is the variational equation for the action , @xmath96 the @xmath75-anti - self - dual equation ( [ sigmaasd ] ) can be derived from this action using a bogomolny argument : there is a lower bound on the action , @xmath97 which is saturated if and only if ( [ sigmaasd ] ) holds .",
    "the proof of ( [ bogomolny bound ] ) in the integrable case @xmath98 appeared in @xcite , and is easily adapted to the case @xmath99 .",
    "one can orthogonally decompose the curvature @xmath100 into two parts satisfying @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the lower bound follows from integrating the identity , @xmath103 and discarding the positive piece @xmath104 .",
    "clearly the inequality is satisfied if and only if @xmath105 .",
    "now we will consider some translation - invariant cases of the spin(7)-instanton equations on @xmath106 .",
    "let @xmath107 and @xmath108 be coordinates on @xmath109 and @xmath110 , with @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "a gauge field invariant under @xmath113-translations is written , @xmath114 its curvature is @xmath115 with @xmath116 denoting the curvature of @xmath117 and @xmath118)\\diff y^a$ ] a covariant derivative .",
    "consider the following su(4)-structure in the case @xmath119 : @xmath120 the ( 2,0)-part of the field strength is @xmath121 - \\im(d_\\mu\\phi_\\nu - d_\\nu\\phi_\\mu ) \\right ) \\th^\\mu\\wedge\\th^\\nu.\\ ] ] if we write @xmath122 , the complex anti - self - dual equation ( [ su4inst1 ] ) can be cast neatly as @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "the second of the spin(7)-instanton equations ( [ su4inst2 ] ) is @xmath125 the hermitian - yang - mills equations are slightly stronger : they consist of ( [ kw3 ] ) , and the vanishing of the ( 2,0)-part ( [ kw0 ] ) of @xmath82 : @xmath126    equations ( [ kw1])-([kw5 ] ) , generalised to a curved manifold , were used by kapustin and witten in their work on the geometric langlands program @xcite . the spin(7)-instanton equations ( [ kw1])-([kw3 ] ) , with complex parameter @xmath127 , define a topological quantum field theory .",
    "when @xmath127 is real these are just the spin(7)-instanton equations ; when @xmath127 is non - real they are equivalent , by taking hermitian and anti - hermitian parts , to the hermitian - yang - mills equations ( [ kw3])-([kw5 ] ) .",
    "so all of kapustin and witten s equations have a natural interpretation as 8-dimensional anti - self - dual equations .    equations ( [ kw1])-([kw3 ] ) have also recently found an application in an analytically continued chern - simons theory .",
    "we will have more to say about this at the end of this section .",
    "now we consider the case @xmath128 .",
    "let @xmath129 be the complex coordinate on @xmath130 and let @xmath131 , @xmath132 , be the complex coordinates on @xmath133 .",

    "a hermitian flow is the analogue for a hermitian manifold of gradient flow on a riemannian manifold or hamiltonian flow on a symplectic manifold .",

    "the fact that ( [ gen hitchin 1 ] ) is a hermitian flow reflects the more general property that the complex anti - self - dual equation ( [ su4inst1 ] ) on @xmath162 is , for suitable @xmath163 , a hermitian flow on the infinite - dimensional space of connections on @xmath163 .",
    "the space @xmath149 of connections on @xmath163 inherits a natural complex structure from that on @xmath163 , and holomorphic and anti - holomorphic vector fields on @xmath149 are ( 1,0)- and ( 0,1)-forms on @xmath163 , respectively .",

    "we will close this section by making a few more comments on the 4-dimensional kapustin - witten equations ( [ kw1])-([kw3 ] ) . in a recent paper @xcite these",
    "were found to play a fundamental role in an analytically continued chern - simons theory .",
    "witten observed that they emerge as gradient flow equations for the real part @xmath171 of a holomorphic chern - simons functional @xmath172 for a complex connection on a 3-manifold .",
    "the above discussion explains why this should be the case : @xmath171 arises by reducing @xmath152 from six to three dimensions .",
    "the complex connection is @xmath173 in the language of subsection [ sec : kw ] , and the hermitian flow in two dimensions reduces to a gradient flow in one dimension .",

    "all of the manifolds that we will consider will be products of coset spaces @xmath1 with tori @xmath16 ( or decompactified tori @xmath174 ) , such that the subgroup @xmath19 of @xmath3 can be embedded in @xmath175 .",
    "the natural @xmath19-structure can then be lifted to an su(4)-structure , which in most of our examples is either nearly khler or cyt .    in the first part of this section",
