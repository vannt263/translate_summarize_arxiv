    "a star polymer consists of linear polymer chains tethered to one common central core .",
    "the number of polymer chains @xmath0 is usually referred to as _ arm number _ or _",
    "functionality_. if the degree of polymerization , i.e. , the number of monomers per chain , @xmath1 , is the same for all chains , the star polymer is called monodisperse with respect to @xmath1 or `` regular '' . for large @xmath1 ,",
    "the size of the central core particle is much smaller than the overall extension of the whole star . for a single star ,",
    "the density of monomers around the central particle , @xmath2 , is radially symmetric , and from this density profile the so - called corona diameter @xmath3 , which measures the extension of the star , can be defined as the diameter of a sphere around the star center where all @xmath4 monomers are found `` inside '' @xcite .    in the last years",
    ", star - shaped polymer aggregates have attracted a considerable amount of interest from both the experimental and the theoretical point of view @xcite .",
    "the reason for that is threefold .",
    "first , from a technical point of view , star polymers are important for several industrial applications @xcite .",
    "one example are hydrogenated polyisoprene star polymers , which are used as viscosity index modifiers in oil industry applications due to their excellent shear stability .",
    "further , commercial star polymers are brought into action in coating materials , as binders in toners for copying machines , and in several pharmaceutical and medical applications @xcite .",
    "second , from an experimental point of view , the recent synthesis of regular star polymers with various possible numbers of arms by roovers and coworkers @xcite made it possible to explore the physics of well - defined model systems , which are monodisperse in both the number of arms and the degree of polymerization .",
    "important examples are polyisoprene stars with @xmath5 @xcite and polybutadiene stars with @xmath6 @xcite , both synthesized by anionic polymerization .",
    "third , star polymers constitute an important soft - condensed matter system , linking the fields of polymer physics and colloid physics , thus attracting also interest from a purely theoretical point of view .",
    "star polymers with small arm numbers ( @xmath7 ) resemble linear polymers .",
    "thus , their configurations show a considerable asphericity @xcite , although their chain - averaged number density of monomers , @xmath2 , is spherically symmetric around the center of mass of the polymer . with increasing arm number @xmath0 ,",
    "the asphericity of the stars has been shown to decrease considerably @xcite , leading to `` stiff '' spherical particles in the limit of high @xmath0 .",
    "it is essentially this limit that a description of star polymers as sterically stabilized colloidal particles holds .",
    "this polymer - colloid hybrid character of star polymers has been explored in a number of publications dealing with the structural @xcite and dynamical @xcite properties of star polymers .    in the usual theoretical description ,",
    "star polymers in dense solution are considered as an effective one - component ( monodisperse ) system , i.e. , all the stars have the same arm number @xmath0 and all the linear polymer chains attached to the center have the same molecular weight . while the latter can be realized by a careful preparation method ,",
    "the former is in general not true in actual samples .",
    "the preparation of star polymers proceeds by adding linear polymer chains to a dendrimer - like core with reactions centers placed at the end of the dendrimer and the polymer chains .",
    "the chemical reaction is typically incomplete such that few of the reaction centers at the dendrimer are not linked to a linear chain .",
    "hence an intrinsic polydispersity in the arm number arises . by ultracentrifugation",
    "one can estimate the relative polydispersity in the arm number to be around 5 - 15 percent in carefully and slowly prepared samples .",
    "it can , however , also be much larger for fast reactions @xcite . in a comparison between experimental data and theory , in almost all previous studies",
    "the assumptions of a monodisperse sample was implicitly made such that a natural question concerns the influence of polydispersity on the statistical properties of star polymer solutions .",
    "as far as theory is concerned , the situation resembles much the case of colloidal suspensions where the effect of charge and size polydispersity has been a topic of intense recent research , see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of arm number polydispersity on the effective interaction , the structural correlations and the phase diagram for star polymer solutions in a good solvent .",
    "our work is based on a theoretical analysis using scaling theory and computer simulations .",
    "we first derive the effective interaction between two star polymers of different arm numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 from scaling assumptions .",
    "basically the interaction is logarithmic with the core - core distance @xmath10 between the two stars but the prefactor depends explicitly on @xmath8 and @xmath9 and differs from that of a monodisperse sample .",
    "the resulting pair potential is tested against molecular simulations and good agreement is found even when @xmath8 is very different from @xmath9 while earlier descriptions @xcite are found to hold for small polydispersities but to be too simplistic for large polydispersities . in a further step towards a full description of dense star polymer solutions ,",
    "we then perform computer simulations of a classical many - body systems interacting by means of this effective pair interaction .",
    "we find that a polydispersity in the arm number reduces the structural correlations but this effect is less drastic than for size polydispersity in sterically stabilized colloidal suspensions .",
    "further , we present evidence that the reentrant melting behavior predicted from the theoretical treatment of a monodisperse description @xcite does not change drastically in a polydisperse solution of star polymers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ ii ] we present the scaling ideas and derive the effective interaction potential between two stars of different arm numbers .",
    "a test of this result against molecular computer simulation is performed in section [ iii ] .",
    "results for the structure and phase diagram from a simulation of a many - body system are given in section [ iv ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ v ] .",
    "the effective interaction between two star polymers results from the steric interaction of all monomers that constitute the polymer chains on each of the stars .",
    "it is obviously a formidable task to derive the effective potential from first principles .",
    "luckily we are in the position to give a rigorous result for the limiting case of short distance between the two star cores , while good arguments exist for the description of the long range part of the interaction .",
    "we have found in the treatment of the interaction of monodisperse star polymers that the combination of these two approaches leads to good agreement with simulation results as well as with scattering experiments on real star polymer systems @xcite .",
    "we first derive the short distance interaction using scaling arguments .",
    "many details of the behavior of polymer solutions may be derived using the renormalization group ( rg ) analysis @xcite . here",
    ", we use only the more basic results of power law scaling : the radius of gyration @xmath11 of a single linear polymer chain with @xmath1 monomers and its partition function @xmath12 are found to obey the power laws : @xmath13 the fugacity @xmath14 measures the mean number of possibilities to add one monomer to the chain .",
    "it is microscopic in nature and will depend on the details of the theoretical model or the experimental system .",
    "the two exponents @xmath15 and @xmath16 on the contrary are universal to all polymer systems in a good solvent , i.e. , excluding high concentration of polymers or systems in which the polymers are collapsed or are near the collapse transition .",
    "a family of additional exponents @xmath17 governs the scaling of the partition functions @xmath18 of polymer stars of @xmath0 chains each with @xmath1 monomers while the power law for the radius of gyration remains unchanged : @xmath19 the exponents of any other power law for more general polymer networks are given by scaling relations in terms of @xmath17 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) imply @xmath20 .",
    "the values of these exponents are known from rg and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite . in the limiting case of many arms , @xmath21 , the leading behavior of @xmath17",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath22 a result that has been found also from of geometrical considerations using the blob model of a star polymer @xcite .",
    "the scaling law for the partition sum of two star polymers may be derived from a short distance expansion @xcite .",
    "the partition sum of the two stars @xmath23 at small center - to - center distances @xmath10 factorizes into a function @xmath24 and the partition function @xmath25 of the star with @xmath26 arms that is formed when the cores of the two stars coincide : @xmath27 such a behavior is generally assumed in scaling arguments . at large star - star separation @xmath23",
    "is the product of the single star partition functions .",
    "again we may argue that the ratio of the partition function of two stars at finite separation @xmath10 to that at infinite separation can only be a function @xmath28 of @xmath29 noting that @xmath30 is the only relevant length scale in this problem ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 differ from @xmath30 only in an @xmath0-dependent prefactor ) : @xmath33 taking this into account and inserting the power law scaling according to eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) we find that eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) are only compatible if also @xmath34 follows a power law @xmath35 and the so - called contact exponent @xmath36 obeys the scaling relation @xmath37 note that in terms of the rg of polymer field theory the exponents @xmath17 correspond to dimensions of operators associated with the partition functions of single stars @xcite and relation ( [ 6 ] ) is a direct consequence of the short distance expansion .",

    "are commonly used : in a steric stabilized system with a polydispersity in the radii of the particles one expects to find an interaction radius that is the _ arithmetic mean _ of the radii of the two interacting particles @xcite . in a charge",
    "stabilized solution the other hand , the interaction of two particles is proportional to the product of the two charges and the effective charge is calculated as the _ geometric mean _ of the two charges .",
    "the latter description was used in an earlier investigation of star polymers treating @xmath0 as an `` effective charge '' parameter @xcite . for comparison with these other possible approaches",
    "we define : @xmath47 @xmath48    we now turn to the interaction at larger separation .",
    "it has been recently shown that a yukawa like tail for the potential between star polymers reproduces the results of both simulation and scattering experiments for monodisperse solutions @xcite .",
    "the natural scale for a star polymer is the corona diameter @xmath49 with @xmath50 @xcite . for the potential between two @xmath0-arm star polymers at distance @xmath51",
    "one has @xmath52 the decay length @xmath53 is the diameter of the outermost blobs of the star polymer in the daoud - cotton model @xcite .    in a simple but successful approach the full potential for the interaction between two @xmath0-arm star polymers",
    "was constructed by concatenating the long range and short range potentials . in this model",
    "the crossover from short to long range behavior takes place when the distance of the two cores is @xmath54 .",
    "it is natural to generalize this to two star polymers with @xmath8 and @xmath9 arms in such a way that the crossover point is at distance @xmath55 .",
    "it is less obvious how to choose the decay length of the long range part .",
    "our choice @xmath56 is in accordance to the simulation results presented below .",
    "note that although we have omitted the subscripts on @xmath3 and @xmath57 , the latter are functions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the full potential then reads @xmath58 in the monodisperse case @xmath59 this potential reduces to the one between two identical star polymers that has been successfully tested in extensive simulations .",
    "we have performed molecular dynamics ( md ) computer simulations of two star polymers with different arm numbers @xmath60 and @xmath61 by resolving the monomers as classical beads along the chains .",
    "we use the same simulation model as in previous studies of star polymer solutions in a good solvent @xcite . the arm length , i.e. , the number @xmath1 of beads along each chain , was kept fixed to @xmath62 which was shown in previous work to be large enough to guarantee a sufficient scaling behavior .",
    "the main features of the simulation model can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "a purely repulsive truncated lennard - jones interaction between all @xmath63 monomers is assumed .",
    "an attractive fene - potential is added for the interaction between neighboring monomers along a chain .",
    "3 .   to accommodate the polymer arms , a hard core with radius @xmath64 is introduced at the center of the stars . the cores interact with the monomers according to the above mentioned potentials with a separation shift of @xmath64 .",
    "two stars with arm numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 were fixed at core separation @xmath10 . after a long equilibration period , the total force @xmath65 acting onto the cores is averaged .",
    "the temperature @xmath66 is kept constant . both the equilibration time and the time during which averages were performed was about @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the lennard - jones time unit with @xmath3 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 denoting the lennard - jones length , energy scale and the monomer mass .",
    "a simulation snapshot is shown in fig .",
    "when comparing the mean force to the derivative of the theoretical effective potential , two technical problems arise : ( i ) in contrast to the theory , we have a finite core size @xmath64 which is the same for both stars .",
    "( ii ) the two corona diameters , @xmath71 , ( @xmath72 ) which enter in the potential of eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) , are not directly accessible in a simulation .    as in the monodisperse case @xcite , the first difficulty ( i )",
    "is overcome by plotting the inverse force @xmath73 versus distance @xmath10 .",
    "the divergence in the force occurs already at core separations @xmath74 which leads to a zero in the @xmath73 plot .",
    "the inverse _ slope _ of the @xmath73-plot then corresponds to the prefactor @xmath75 of the logarithmic term in the effective pair potential .",
    "it is this slope which can directly be compared to our theoretical prediction eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , a linear function in the @xmath73 plot is a direct check for the validity of the @xmath76-term in the effective interaction potential , eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) .    to handle the second difficulty ( ii ) we consider the radius of gyration @xmath77 of each star which is readily accessible in a simulation of a single star@xcite .",
    "we assume a proportionality between the @xmath77 and @xmath71 , @xmath78 and use @xmath79 as a fit parameter to fit the full force versus distance curve for given arm numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the results for the optimal fit parameter are shown in table [ parameters.table ] .",
    "we obtain an averaged value of @xmath80 , which is nearly independent of @xmath81 .",

    "we observe two important facts : first , the data indeed fall on a straight line proving the logarithmic behavior of the potential inside the mean corona .",
    "the straight line hits the origin at @xmath85 showing the relevance of the finite core in the simulations .",
    "second , the inverse slope @xmath86 agrees very well with the theoretical prediction also shown in figure [ invforce.plot ] .",

    "while the expression @xmath89 gained from scaling theory is able to describe the slope even for large asymmetries , @xmath90 is worse at large asymmetries while @xmath91 even possesses the wrong curvature as a function of @xmath9 .",

    "representative particle configurations of approximately 2000 star polymers in a cubic simulation box were created in the following manner .",
    "first , a starting particle configuration was built up by placing the particles on random positions in the box , each particle assigned with an arm number @xmath0 chosen from a gaussian distribution @xmath96 of mean @xmath97 and variance @xmath98 : @xmath99 . \\label{gaussian}\\ ] ] we use eq .",

    "note that nonphysical , negative arm numbers , which are in principle not prohibited by a gaussian arm number distribution , did not occur in the simulations for the values of @xmath101 and @xmath100 chosen here .",
    "second , an equilibration phase of approximately @xmath102 mc cycles was performed by allowing both translational particle moves according to the standard metropolis scheme , and particle exchanges of randomly chosen particle pairs , again using the metropolis rule to decide an exchange to happen or not . for the calculation of pair potential energies ,",
    "( [ 13 ] ) was used , together with the scaling relation @xcite : @xmath103 after the equilibration phase , approximately @xmath104 mc cycles were simulated to gather statistics for both the radial center - to - center distribution function @xmath105 and the center - to - center structure factor @xmath106 @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we will use @xmath107 as the basic length scale , and the mean packing fraction @xmath108 ( @xmath109 being the number density of the stars ) as a measure of the density .    in order to investigate the polydispersity effects on the liquid structure of dense star polymer solutions , simulations with varying polydispersities @xmath100",
    "were performed at ( average ) arm numbers @xmath101 and mean packing fractions @xmath110 , known to correspond to the liquid state in the monodisperse case @xmath111 @xcite .",

    "[ gs.f32 ] . as can be seen",
    ", increasing the polydispersity leads to decreasing spatial correlations in the fluid , indicated by a decreasing principal peak height of both @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "thus , as expected , the effect of arm number polydispersity in star polymer solutions is quite similar to the effect of charge polydispersity in solutions of charged colloids @xcite .",
    "note that the anomalous behavior of @xmath106 reported for monodisperse star polymer solutions in ref .",
    "@xcite also holds for polydisperse star polymer solution for all polydispersities @xmath112 simulated .    in order to explore the evolution of the freezing and reentrant melting phase transitions",
    "found for monodisperse star polymer solutions @xcite with increasing polydispersity , we employed the following strategy .",
    "we performed a number of simulations at state points corresponding to the solid phase in the monodisperse case , gradually increasing the parameter @xmath100 .",
    "in particular , we chose @xmath113 and @xmath114 in a first set of simulations .",
    "our results for @xmath105 and @xmath106 are given in fig .",
    "[ gs.f40 ] .",
    "let us begin with the discussion of the @xmath105-data . as the monodisperse case @xmath111 corresponds to an solid state of bcc - symmetry @xcite , the shown @xmath105 is , in fact , the radially - averaged pair correlation function of the stars in the crystal state .",
    "again , increasing @xmath100 leads to decreasing structural correlations between the particles indicated by a decreasing principal peak height and a `` smearing - out '' of the sub peak - structure of @xmath105 seen for @xmath111 .",
    "this scenario also manifests itself in the structure factors shown in fig .",
    "[ gs.f40](b ) .",
    "notice that the corresponding structure factor for @xmath111 exhibits strong bragg peaks , again indicating the monodisperse system to be in the crystal state for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and is not depicted for that reason . for nonzero polydispersities",
    "the simulated structure factors do not show bragg peaks and the value of the principal peak heights @xmath117 decreases .",
    "thus , increasing the polydispersity in a sample of star polymers at @xmath115 , @xmath116 leads to a melting transition from a @xmath118 crystal to a fluid phase .",
    "we therefore expect polydisperse star polymer solutions to show an enlarged fluid phase region as compared to the phase diagram of monodisperse star polymers in refs .",
    "furthermore , the stability range of the fluid phase is expected to increase with increasing the polydispersity @xmath100 . to corroborate this expectation in more detail ,",
    "we have performed further mc simulations of polydisperse star polymers for various state points ( @xmath101 , @xmath110 ) , all corresponding to state points close to the freezing or reentrant melting line in the monodisperse case @xcite . for the ranges of polydispersity examined here , ( @xmath119 ) , no change in the topology of the phase diagram and no new crystalline phases were found as a result of polydispersity .",
    "a quantitative calculation of the full phase diagram by more sophisticated simulation methods @xcite is beyond the scope of this paper and will be left for future studies .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the effect of arm number polydispersity on the effective interaction and the structural correlations between star polymers in a good solvent .",
    "an analytical expression for an effective pair potential , given by eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) , was put forward and its validity was confirmed by molecular dynamics computer simulation .",
    "this pair potential was subsequently used to simulate the structural correlations between many stars .",
    "as expected , correlations decrease with increasing polydispersity . at the same time , though , the effect is much less pronounced than for size - polydisperse hard spheres .",
    "this can be seen in analogy to colloidal suspensions where size polydispersity of sterically - stabilized suspensions is known to lead to much more pronounced effects than charge - polydispersity in charged suspension .",
    "the microscopic reason for that is that the effective interaction is much softer for charged colloids which is similar to our case of star polymers .",
    "we finish with a couple of remarks : first it would be interesting to compare , both qualitatively and quantitatively , our theoretical predictions to experimental data . in fact , the intrinsic polydispersity in the arm number can be measured and structural correlations are accessible , e.g. , by neutron scattering of a star polymer solution with marked cores .",
    "second , it would be interesting to map out , for a given polydispersity , the full phase diagram including freezing into different solid structures . also , it would be interesting to develop and apply a liquid integral equation theory to predict structural correlations in a polydisperse star polymer solutions .",
    "the output of such a theory could be checked against our computer simulation data of section [ iv ] .",
    "third , we have not considered a polydispersity in the length of the linear polymer chains attached to the centers .",
