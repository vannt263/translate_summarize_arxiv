    "the @xmath0be nucleus is a loosely bound n+@xmath6 system .",

    "investigations of the @xmath0be fragmentation are of interest for astrophysics , in particular for the problems of nuclear synthesis of chemical elements with atomic number  a@xmath88 .",
    "the study of the @xmath0be fragmentation at relativistic energies gives the possibility of observing the reaction fragments which are the decay products of unbound @xmath3be and @xmath9he nuclei@xcite .",
    "the method of nuclear emulsions used in the present paper allows one to observe the charged component of the relativistic @xmath0be@xmath12he+n fragmentation channel . owing to a good angular resolution of this method it is possible to separate the @xmath0be fragmentation events which are accompanied by the production of an unstable @xmath3be nucleus with its subsequent breakup to two @xmath5 particles . in this case , the absence of a combinatorial background ( of three and more @xmath5 particles ) for @xmath0be which is typical of heavier n@xmath5 nuclei @xmath10c and @xmath11o makes it possible to observe distinctly this picture .",
    "the present paper is of importance for estimating the @xmath3be role in more complicated n@xmath5 systems .",
    "nuclear emulsions were exposed to relativistic @xmath0be nuclei at the jinr nuclotron .",
    "a beam of relativistic @xmath0be nuclei was obtained in the @xmath12b@xmath13be fragmentation reaction using a polyethylene target .",
    "the @xmath0be nuclei constituted about 80% of the beam , the remaining 20% fell on li and he nuclei .",
    "the exposed emulsion stack consistent of 15 layers of the br-2 emulsion . the layer thickness and dimensions",
    "were 600 @xmath14 m and 10@xmath1520 @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "events were sought by viewing the particle tracks by mean of the mbi-9 microscope .",
    "we found about 160 events of the @xmath0be fragmentation involving the two he fragment production in the forward fragmentation cone with a polar angle of 6@xmath17(0.1 rad ) .",
    "the requirement of conservation of the fragment charge in the fragmentation cone was fulfilled for the detected events .",
    "we allowed 57 tracks of various types in a wide ( larger than 6@xmath17 ) cone for the purpose of accumulating additional statistics .",
    "the charge of the he fragment tracks was estimated by sight , for the emulsion method makes it possible to distinguish reliably the h and he isotopes .",
    "an example of the @xmath0be@xmath12he fragmentation event in emulsion is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] @xcite .",
    "this event belongs to the class of white stars as far as it contains neither target nucleus fragments , nor produced mesons .",
    "the angles of the tracks in emulsion for the detected events were measured by the ksm-1 microscope .",
    "we measured the coordinates of ten points on the primary nucleus track and of ten points on each of the fragment tracks .",
    "the points were selected to be spaced by a step of 100 @xmath14 m , the overall track length used for measurement being 1 mm . by suggesting a linear dependence between the coordinates of the track points the least square method was used to find the p@xmath18 and p@xmath19 coefficients of the first - degree approximating polynomial of the z(x ) and y(x ) coordinate dependences .",
    "the coordinates of a supposed interaction point ( vertex ) were suggested to be equal to zero .",
    "the angles were calculated by the found coefficients . at present angular measurements",
    "were carried out for 70 fragmentation events .",
    "the accuracy of measurements of the he fragment emission angles was estimated on the basis of the p@xmath20 coefficient distribution for z(x)=p@xmath20+p@xmath21x in experiment ( fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the p@xmath20 value shows a divergence between the measured and calculated z coordinates of the event vertex . in this case",
    ", the z coordinate was measured less accurately which is explained by a specific treatment of the emulsion layers as well as by measurement errors .",
    "for example , due to treatment the emulsion layer thickness decreases by about a factor of two and the error in z coordinate measurements depends on an exact focusing on the track .",
    "for the track length of 1 mm the measurement accuracy was found to be not worse than 4.5@xmath22 rad . , which was about 34 mev / c ( see eq.[eq1 ] ) after evaluating it in the @xmath5 particle transverse momenta .",
    "the opening angle @xmath23 of two he fragments was measured as the angle of one of the tracks with respect to the other .",
    "this way enabled us to determine the opening angle more accurately by decreasing distortion effects in a layer .",
    "thus in experiment a mean value of the measurement error was 1.3@xmath22 rad .",
    ", which was quite enough for separating events involving the @xmath3be production . a distinctive feature of the experiment using the emulsion method consists in that the quality of measurements of small @xmath23 angles between tracks ( 46@xmath22 rad . )",
    "depends on the conditions of treatment and storage of layers , as well as on the positioning of an event in the layer .",
    "for example , distortions for small @xmath23 are seen to depend on the mutual orientation of the plane of an emulsion layer and that of a track pair .",
    "the strongest distortions are observed when the planes are perpendicular to each other which affects the shape of the angular distribution for @xmath23(fig .",

    "in analyzing the data both he fragments observed in the @xmath0be@xmath12he+n channel were supposed to be @xmath5 particles .",
    "this assumption is motivated by the fact that at small angles the @xmath0be@xmath12@xmath26he+n fragmentation channel with an energy threshold of 1.57  mev must dominate the @xmath0be@xmath27he+@xmath26he+n channel whose energy threshold is 22.15  mev .",

    "[ fig:3]a the p@xmath24 transverse momentum distribution of @xmath5 particles in the laboratory frame of reference is calculated without the account of particle energy losses in emulsion by the equation @xmath29 where p@xmath18 , a and @xmath30 are the momentum per nucleon , the fragment mass and the polar emission angle , respectively .",
    "the mean value of the transverse momentum in the laboratory system was @xmath31=109 mev / c , and the distribution fwhm was @xmath32=66 mev / c .",
    "this may be an indication of the fact that the experimental data are not of the same kind which can be pronounced when going over to the c.m.s . of two @xmath5 particles .    the p@xmath33 transverse momentum distribution of @xmath5 particles in the c.m.s",

    "we clearly see a tendency toward an increase of the mean @xmath5 particle momentum with increasing their multiplicity .",
    "this implies a growth of the total coulomb interaction of alpha clusters arising in nuclei .     the opening @xmath23 angle distribution of @xmath5 particles in the @xmath0be@xmath12@xmath5 fragmentation reaction at 1.2  a  gev energy.,width=480 ]    a particular feature of the observed @xmath0be@xmath12@xmath5 fragmentation is a total deflection of an @xmath5 particle pair with respect to the axis associated with the primary nucleus direction .",
    "the average value of a missingtransverse momentum p@xmath39 for 28 events of the type of the whitestar is @xmath40127 mev / c .",
    "this effect can be explained both by the influence of a neutron which is invisiblein emulsion and by the recoil nuclei .",
    "the @xmath3be production channel is not the only possible one which involves the two he fragment production .",
    "in particular , in @xcite one discusses the possibility of observing a channel @xmath0be@xmath41he+@xmath422@xmath5+n . in the present paper , this channel is not considered as far as it is impossible to observe a neutron ( the latter leaves no track in emulsion ) .    in the opening angle @xmath23 distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) one can also see two peaks with mean values 4.5@xmath43rad . and 27@xmath44rad .",
    "the ratio of the numbers of the events in the peaks is close to unity .",
    "the @xmath45 distribution entails the invariant energy q@xmath46 distribution which is calculated as a difference between the effective invariant mass m@xmath46 of an @xmath5 fragment pair and the doubled @xmath5 particle mass by the equation @xmath47 where p@xmath48 is the @xmath5 particle 4-momentum .    in the invariant energy q@xmath46 distribution",
    "there are two peaks in the ranges 0 to 1 mev and 2 to 4 mev .",
    "the shape of the distribution does not contradict the suggestion about the @xmath0be fragmentation involving the production of an unstable @xmath3be nucleus which decays in the 0@xmath4 and 2@xmath4 states .",
    "the values of the peaks of the invariant energy q@xmath46 and the transverse momenta p@xmath49 in the c.m.s . relate to each other . to the q@xmath46 range from 0 to 1  mev with a peak at 100  kev",
    "there corresponds a peak p@xmath25 with @xmath3725  mev / c , and to the q@xmath46 range from 2 to 4  mev there corresponds a peak with @xmath37102  mev / c .",
