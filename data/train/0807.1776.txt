    "recent measurements of redshift and luminosity - distance relations of type ia supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "this observation gives rise to the search for a matter field , which can be responsible for accelerated expansion .",
    "there are several proposals regarding this , _ cosmological constant , quintessence , dark energy _ [ 3 - 5 ] being some of the competent candidates .",
    "however , most of these models fit only to spatially flat @xmath1 friedmann - robertson - walker model [ 6 ] , though a few models [ 7 ] work for open universe ( @xmath2 ) also .",
    "brans- dicke ( bd ) theory has been proved to be very effective regarding the recent study of cosmic acceleration [ 8 ] .",
    "bd theory is explained by a scalar function @xmath3 and a constant coupling constant @xmath0 , often known as the bd parameter .",
    "this can be obtained from general theory of relativity ( gr ) by letting @xmath4 and @xmath5 [ 9 ] .",
    "this theory has very effectively solved the problems of inflation and the early and the late time behaviour of the universe .",
    "n. banerjee and d. pavon [ 8 ] have shown that bd scalar tensor theory can potentially solve the quintessence problem . the generalized bd theory [ 10 ]",
    "is an extension of the original bd theory with a time dependent coupling function @xmath0 . in generalized bd theory ,",
    "the bd parameter @xmath0 is a function of the scalar field @xmath3 .",
    "n. banerjee and d. pavon have shown that the generalized bd theory can give rise to a decelerating radiation model where the big - bang nucleosynthesis scenario is not adversely affected [ 8 ] .",
    "modified bd theory with a self - interacting potential have also been introduced in this regard .",
    "bertolami and martins [ 11 ] have used this theory to present an accelerated universe for spatially flat model .",
    "all these theories conclude that @xmath0 should have a low negative value in order to solve the cosmic acceleration problem .",
    "this contradicts the solar system experimental bound @xmath6 .",
    "however bertolami and martins [ 11 ] have obtained the solution for accelerated expansion with a potential @xmath7 and large @xmath8 , although they have not considered the positive energy conditions for the matter and scalar field .",
    "+ in this paper , we investigate the possibilities of obtaining accelerated expansion of the universe in bd theory where we have considered a self - interacting potential @xmath9 which is a function of the bd scalar field @xmath3 itself and a variable bd parameter which is also a function of @xmath3 .",
    "we show all the cases of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 to consider all the possible solutions .",
    "we examine these solutions for both barotropic fluid and the generalized chaplygin gas [ 12 - 13 ] , to get a generalized view of the results in the later case .",
    "we analyze the conditions under which we get a negative @xmath14 ( deceleration parameter , @xmath15 ) in all the models of the universe . for this purpose",
