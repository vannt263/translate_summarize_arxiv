    "magnetization dynamics driven electrically by spin - polarized currents through the spin transfer torque@xcite has attracted considerable attention due to its applications in memory and logic spintronic devices.@xcite an alternative mechanism , the spin - orbit torque ( sot ) , has been recently proposed as a means to control the magnetization of a single ferromagnetic@xcite or even antiferromagnetic@xcite layer without the need of an external spin - polarizer .",
    "the sot arises from the interaction between the nonequilibrium spin density of carriers and the local magnetization .",
    "the non - equilibrium spin density results from the transfer of angular momentum between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom of the carriers.@xcite the sot requires magnetic structures with strong spin - orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking .",

    "these torques are also commonly referred to as the _ out - of - plane _ and _ in - plane _ torques , respectively , with respect to the ( @xmath6 ) plane .",
    "the direction of the field - like ( out - of - plane ) and anti - damping - like ( in - plane ) torques and their detailed angular dependence@xcite depend on the crystal structure , while their magnitude has been shown to strongly depend on the materials considered .",
    "@xcite    two main mechanisms have been invoked to explain the origin of the current - driven torques in non - centrosymmetric ferromagnets . in the first scenario ,",
    "the lack of inversion symmetry enables the inverse spin galvanic effect@xcite ( isge ) , i.e. flowing current directly produces a nonequilibrium spin density @xmath7 locally , whose direction is determined by the symmetry of the spin - orbit coupling .",

    "the difficulty in determining the physical origin of the torques partly lies in the complexity of the ultrathin bilayer considered , involving both bulk and interfacial transport in the current - in - plane configuration .",
    "first principle calculations have indeed pointed out the significant sensitivity of the torques to the nature of the interfaces.@xcite    in a recent publication , kurebayashi et al.@xcite investigated the sot in a bulk dms .",
    "they observed a large anti - damping - like torque that is not ascribed to the she since no adjacent spin - orbit coupled paramagnet is present .",
    "it was then proposed that such a torque has a scattering - independent origin in the berry curvature of the band structure , in a similar spirit as the intrinsic she was introduced about ten years ago.@xcite    in this paper , we present a systematic theoretical study of sots arising from the isge and berry curvature mechanisms in a spin - independent relaxation time approximation .",
    "we focus our attention on the current - driven spin - orbit field ( called the sot field ) , @xmath15 , producing the spin - orbit torque @xmath16 .",
    "these sot fields have an _ in - plane _ component of the isge origin@xcite @xmath17 [ i.e. lying in the ( @xmath6 ) plane and producing an out - of - plane torque ] and also an intrinsic contribution arising from interband transitions .",

    "we model three distinct cases : ( i ) the parabolic approximation where no centro - symmetric spin - orbit coupling is present ( @xmath170 ) , ( ii ) the spherical approximation where the centro - symmetric spin - orbit coupling is turned on but spherical symmetry is retained ( @xmath171 ) and ( iii ) the diamond crystal where both cubic symmetry and centro - symmetric spin - orbit coupling are accounted for ( @xmath157 ) .",

    "this results into an increase of the interband sot fields and an additional angular dependence shown by @xmath178  symbols in fig .",
    "microscopically , the latter effect is caused by the distorted spin textures on the fermi surface .",
    "the influence of the centro - symmetric spin - orbit field on the spin torque in gamnas has also been identified by haney  et  al.@xcite in dms spin - valves .",
    "we have studied the intraband and interband sot fields using kubo formula , in the prototypical case of a ferromagnetic 2deg with rashba spin - orbit coupling , as well as in a three - dimensional dms modelled by a kinetic - exchange kohn - luttinger hamiltonian . for the latter , parameters pertaining to (",

    "nevertheless , the numerical analysis of the three - dimensional dms system also unravels the complex interplay between the different types of spin - orbit coupling ( centro - symmetric and non - centro - symmetric ) involved in realistic systems resulting in complex dependences of the sot fields on the magnetization direction as well as significant differences from the rashba 2deg model .",
    "the contribution of interband mixing to the sot presents an outstanding opportunity to explain the emergence of large anti - damping - like torques that can not be readily attributed to spin hall effect , offering an interesting platform to interpret recent puzzling results.@xcite    i.g . acknowledges financial support from canadian nserc .",
