    "[ sec : poincare ] we show that observers _ inside _ the system can use the excitations of the model ( without reference to a lattice spacing ) to define distances purely relationally .",
    "we also show that the maps between observers are naturally given by poincar transformations .",
    "this leads us to interpret this model as a `` quantum minkowski space '' .",
    "we briefly discuss consequences of this argument for the problem of quantum gravity , as well as certain observations about the precise relationship of our model to minkowski space in the conclusions .",
    "how else could the leibniz - clarke correspondence have gone ? how could the tension between quantity and relation have been resolved ? how is one to obtain the notion of distance in a purely relational manner ?",
    "the first thing to realize is that the tension between quantity and relation can not be resolved by relying on kinematics alone . given a dynamical degree of freedom like a traveling mode one can use it to define the notion of distance by defining how much it travels in a certain amount of time , i.e. by defining its velocity . this is just how we define the unit of length today , namely by setting the speed of light ( see @xcite ) .",
    "what is needed is a distinctive set of traveling degrees of freedom or excitations , that can be used to define the notion of distance in this way .    to be concrete we will look at a particular model , the heisenberg spin chain and its higher dimensional generalizations .",
    "its hamiltonian is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 , and the @xmath2 s are the pauli matrices . for nearest neighbor interactions the lowest lying excitations are of the form @xmath3 where the @xmath4 s and @xmath5 s denote eigenvectors of @xmath6 and the @xmath5 occurs at the @xmath7-th position .",
    "the @xmath8 s take the form @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "solving the schrdinger equation gives the eigenvalues of @xmath12 as a function of @xmath13 : @xmath14 we will denote the corresponding eigenvectors by @xmath15 .    this is a set of traveling degrees of freedom of the model . in the next section",
    "we will use these to give a purely relational definition of distance . note that the excitations we have introduced are perfectly well - defined _ without the introduction of a lattice spacing_.",
    "using the excitations of the model described above we can now proceed to define quantities like distance in a completely relational manner . this can be done by picking one particular excitation and assigning a speed to it .",
    "a length is then defined to be the amount the excitation has travelled in a certain time interval .",
    "a distinctive excitation in our model is given by the fastest wave packets .",
    "these excitations are of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is peaked around that value of @xmath13 for which @xmath18 is maximal .",
    "these wave packets are distinguished by the fact that no other excitation can overtake them .",
    "all observers , which can also be thought of as excitations of the system , will agree on that , independent of the way they themselves move .",
    "this characterization is thus completely relational .",
    "since observers in the spin model have only the above excitations at their disposal to explore their world there is no way for them to tell whether they are moving or resting with respect to the lattice .",
    "it is thus consistent and natural for all of them to assign the _",
    "same _ speed to these excitations .     between the two coordinate systems given by the mapping of physical events onto each other .",
    "this map @xmath19 will have the property that it maps the fastest excitations onto fastest excitations .",
    "we find then that this map @xmath19 must be a poincar transformation .",
    "[ fig : relativ],height=226 ]    what will be the map between the coordinate systems of two observers ? in the limit that the spin system looks smooth to the observers we can answer this question .",
    "the map can be constructed by mapping physical events onto each other .",
    "this map will in particular map the fastest excitations in one coordinate system onto the fastest excitations in the other system .",
    "since these excitations have the same speed in both systems the map can only be a poincar transformation ( see figure [ fig : relativ ] ) .",
    "one thus obtains a `` quantum minkowski space '' .",
    "as it was pointed out by clarke in his correspondence with leibniz , in a completely relational theory there exists a tension between quantities and relations .",
    "we have seen here how this tension can be resolved provided one has access to excitations that can be used to define the notion of distance by defining the speed of these excitations .",
    "a consequence of this definition is that the natural mapping between two observers is given by a poincar transformation .    to define a notion of distance in a relational way it was necessary to have access to the dynamics of the theory .",
    "a purely kinematic approach is not sufficient .",
    "it is here where some of the candidate theories of quantum gravity , like loop quantum gravity@xcite or causal set theory@xcite , face their greatest problems .",
    "the arguments presented here suggest that the dynamics of the theory is required to make progress on important issues like the question of the semi - classical limit of the theory .",
    "we conclude by remarking that the model presented above does deviate from usual minkowski space in two ways . in order for us to find poincar transformations we assumed that the excitations involved are all well separated from each other . if this is not the case an operational definition of distance and duration can not be given anymore .",
    "another deviation occurs when the observers have access to excitations with very high values of @xmath13 ( these excitations are not to be confused with the fastest excitations used above ) . in this case",
    "the observers would notice the spin lattice and would find measurable deviations from poincar invariance .",
