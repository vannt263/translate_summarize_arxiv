    "the simplest algorithm to simulate the lerw problem on computer is to actually generate the trail of a random walk step - by - step on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice . at each new step , if a loop is formed it is erased .",
    "this is straight - forward to implement , but requires large memory in large dimensions @xmath0 , as for simulating a walk of @xmath22 steps , one needs to have a lattice of linear size @xmath145 , which means that the required memory increases as @xmath146 .",
    "the algorithm that makes the most efficient use of memory would store the walk as a linked list , keeping only the unerased steps .",

    "but the propagation of avalanches occurs along spanning trees path in the equivalence between the sandpile model and spanning trees @xcite .",

    "thus the numerically determined loop - size distribution is an average over more than @xmath218 loops ( only about @xmath219 of the steps taken form non - trivial loops on square lattice ) .",

    "clearly , simulation of the abelian sandpile model with equal number of avalanches is not possible with available computing machines .",
    "secondly , our simulations are done on an effectively infinite lattice , and there are no complicated boundary effects to complicate the analysis of data .",
