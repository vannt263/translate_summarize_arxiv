    "the computation of loop amplitudes by traditional methods is notoriously difficult involving laborious calculation . at one loop , traditional feynman diagram techniques , augmented by computers , are in wide - spread use for up to four external particles . beyond this ,",
    "computations become significantly more complicated and traditional approaches are problematic .",
    "non - traditional approaches have recently been used to compute all one - loop massless five - parton amplitudes @xcite and a variety of infinite sequences of one - loop amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the technical developments which allowed for this progress include methods involving spinor helicity @xcite , color decompositions @xcite , supersymmetry @xcite , string - theory @xcite , recursion relations @xcite , factorization @xcite and unitarity @xcite .",
    "these developments have been mostly limited to massless amplitudes . however , in many physical processes , such as near particle thresholds or in the production of heavy states , one can not neglect masses .",
    "there is , for example , some concern that the underlying cause of the apparent discrepancy between the low and high energy measurements of the strong coupling constant is due to ignoring masses @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend unitarity techniques to obtain particular examples of massive one loop amplitudes directly from tree amplitudes .",
    "unitarity has been a useful tool in quantum field theory since its inception .",
    "the cutkosky rules @xcite allow one to obtain the imaginary ( absorptive ) parts of one - loop amplitudes directly from tree amplitudes .",
    "traditionally , dispersion relations are then used to reconstruct real ( dispersive ) parts , up to ambiguities in rational functions .",
    "although computationally more powerful than feynman rules , the rational function ambiguity has hampered the use of unitarity as a method for obtaining complete amplitudes .",
    "recently , it was shown that for certain ` cut - constructible ' massless amplitudes  such as supersymmetric amplitudes ",
    "one may obtain the full amplitude solely from the cuts @xcite .",
    "this type of procedure has the inherent advantage of building loop amplitudes from tree amplitudes which are generally compact , rather than from more complicated feynman diagrams .",
    "with this technique , massless one - loop supersymmetric amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external legs , but fixed helicity structure , have been obtained .",
    "the main new ingredient used to remove ambiguities from cut constructions is the complete knowledge of all integral functions @xcite entering into massless one - loop amplitudes .",
    "this severely limits the analytic form of amplitudes .",
    "the cut construction method may be extended to full massless qcd by computing to higher order in the dimensional regularization parameter @xcite . in this way ,",
    "all terms in _ any _ massless one - loop amplitude become associated with branch cuts which may be used to reconstruct the complete amplitude .    in general",
    ", one is also interested in massive theories such as qcd with heavy quarks .",
    "the amplitudes of such theories contain logarithms that depend only on masses ; such functions do not have cuts in any kinematic variable .",
    "this might seem to imply that one can not obtain all of the terms in massive amplitudes via unitarity .",
    "however , we will explicitly show for four - gluon amplitudes with a massive quark loop that the well known form of their ultraviolet or infrared - mass singularities provides sufficient information on the coefficients of all potentially ambiguous functions .",
    "we also present the result for the scattering , via a massive quark loop , of five - gluons with identical helicities .",
    "( these amplitudes have not been computed previously . ) the efficiency of the method for these examples may be characterized by the fact that intermediate algebraic expressions are about the same size as final expressions for the amplitude . due to this feature there is no need for computer assistance in performing the computations presented in this paper .",

    "for loop amplitudes , to maximize the benefit of the spinor helicity method we must choose an appropriate regularization scheme . in conventional dimensional regularization @xcite , the polarization vectors are taken to be @xmath8-dimensional ; this is incompatible with spinor helicity which assumes that the polarization vectors are four dimensional .",
    "an alternative is to modify the regularization scheme to define the polarization vectors to be four dimensional .",
    "one also defines all internal and external states to be four - dimensional and only continues loop momentum and phase - space integrals to @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "this is the four - dimensional - helicity ( fdh ) scheme @xcite , which has been shown to be equivalent @xcite to an appropriate helicity formulation of siegel s dimensional - reduction scheme @xcite at one - loop .",

    "@xmath9 gauge theory amplitudes can be written in terms of independent color - ordered partial amplitudes multiplied by an associated color trace @xcite .",
    "one of the key features of the partial amplitudes is that the external legs have a fixed ordering .",

    "an essential feature of this decomposition is that the partial amplitudes , @xmath23 , are described by diagrams with a fixed cyclic ordering of external legs . in this paper",
    "we deal exclusively with such amplitudes .",
    "in this section we demonstrate how a naive application of the cutkosky rules can miss contributions to a complete one - loop amplitude .",
    "traditionally , one first computes the imaginary ( absorptive ) part of an amplitude by evaluating a four - dimensional phase - space integral .",
    "( the phase - space integrals are not ultraviolet divergent and therefore converge in four - dimensions . )",
    "the real ( dispersive ) part is then reconstructed via a dispersion relation .",
    "we perform the cut calculation a bit differently ; since we want the complete amplitude , it is convenient to replace the phase - space integral with an unrestricted loop momentum integral which has the correct branch cuts @xcite .",
    "this allows us to simultaneously construct the real and imaginary parts .",
    "the ambiguities that we encounter are equivalent to those of the more conventional approach .",
    "we will compute cuts of massive amplitudes in all possible channels in an attempt to reconstruct their functional form .",
    "we consider the amplitude , not in a physical kinematic configuration , but in a region where exactly one of the momentum invariants is taken to be above threshold , and the rest are negative ( space - like ) . in this way we isolate cuts in a single momentum channel .",
    "furthermore , following refs .",
    "@xcite , we apply the cutkosky rules at the amplitude level , rather than at the diagram level .",
    "this is advantageous because amplitudes are generally much more compact than diagrams .",
    "consider the @xmath24-channel ( @xmath25 ) cut of the four - gluon amplitude pictorially represented in a , and given by the phase - space integral       @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the mass of the particle in the loop , @xmath30 is the positive energy branch of the delta - function and ` disc ' means the discontinuity across the branch cut .",
    "note that , in performing the sewing of the tree amplitudes , we have maintained the clockwise ordering of the legs , as required by the color decomposition .    since we wish to reconstruct the full amplitude and not just the imaginary ( or absorptive ) part , it is convenient to replace the phase - space integral with the cut of an unrestricted loop momentum integral @xcite",
    ". this is accomplished by replacing the @xmath31-functions , which impose on - shellness , with propagators : we replace with @xmath32 as indicated this equation is valid only on the @xmath24-cut .",
    "a similar equation holds on the @xmath33-cut ( where @xmath34 ) , depicted in b. up to potential ambiguities in rational functions , one obtains the full amplitude by combining the two cuts into a single function .    for example , consider the amplitude @xmath35 with a massive scalar in the loop .",
    "this amplitude is useful for illustrative purposes because it is particularly simple .",
    "the tree amplitudes entering the two sides are easily computed from feynman diagrams and are given by @xmath36 where legs @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent the cut scalar lines . from the scalar loop contribution to the four - gluon amplitude is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the scalar integral box function given . ] in of . the function @xmath40 contains branch cuts since it contains logarithms and dilogarithms . at this stage",
    "the equality of both sides of the equation is only for the cut in the @xmath24-channel .",
    "the @xmath33-channel cut is similar and may be obtained by relabeling the legs by @xmath41 . using the identity @xmath42 the full amplitude is found to have the form @xmath43 since it has the correct branch cuts .",
    "the rational terms have no cuts . indeed , if we compare this to the correct result for the amplitude @xmath44 we explicitly see that the last term was missed by our naive application of the cutkosky rules .",
    "we note that setting @xmath45 in gives the correct massless scalar loop result @xcite .",
    "we now demonstrate that the last term in , which is cut - free , may be obtained from the first one with little additional work but with a more careful application of unitarity .",
    "the cutkosky rules are valid in arbitrary dimensions  that is they may be used with dimensional regularization . by working to all orders in the dimensional regularization parameter , @xmath46 , the number of potential ambiguities is greatly reduced . in a massless theory , it is clear that there are no polynomial ambiguities in dimensionally regularized expressions .",
    "all terms necessarily must contain cuts since the dimensions are shifted by @xmath47 and must therefore be proportional to factors of the form @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is some kinematic variable .",
    "for example , in the massless case , by working to higher order in @xmath50 , the @xmath51 in appears as @xmath52 which contains cuts at @xmath53 linked to the @xmath51 . indeed , this observation may be used to compute the rational part of massless amplitudes directly from the cuts @xcite .    for massive theories",
    "this simple argument requires modification , because of the presence of additional dimensionful parameters ( the masses ) .",
    "a factor of @xmath54 can in principle soak up dimensions to generate terms without cuts .",
    "we will return to this issue at the end of this section .    as a first step in removing the rational function ambiguities , we modify the calculation of the previous section to be valid to all orders in the dimensional regularization parameter , @xmath50 ;",
    "as we shall see this automatically removes most ambiguities .",
    "we consider again the cut integral in and a , except this time we replace the four - dimensional loop momenta , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , with @xmath8-dimensional ones . a simple way to implement this is to modify the on - shell condition on the cuts to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are left in four - dimensions , but @xmath57 is a vector representing the @xmath58-dimensional part of the loop momentum .",
    "( see appendices [ higherdimensionappendix ] and [ muslashetc ] . ) with this notation , it is easy to see that the dimensionally regularized forms of the tree amplitudes are obtained from by shifting @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the dimensionally regularized expression for the @xmath24-channel cut replacing is @xmath60 where we have explicitly separated out the integration over the @xmath58-dimensions .",
    "the box denominator is @xmath61 in obtaining this form we used the standard prescription that a four - dimensional vector is orthogonal to a @xmath58-dimensional one .",
    "this representation of dimensional regularization follows the one used in its original derivation @xcite and has recently been used by mahlon in his recursive approach @xcite .    as discussed in , integrals with powers of @xmath62 in the numerator",

    "hence , the amplitude must have the form @xmath275    since there are only two cut - free functions , @xmath74 and @xmath77 , and two types of ultraviolet divergences , quadratic and logarithmic , we may fix the coefficients @xmath276 and @xmath277 by making the amplitude have the correct total ultraviolet divergence .",
    "this explains the two step procedure of .",
    "following the discussion for the massless case in ref .",
    "@xcite one may extend the above arguments to an arbitrary number of legs .",
    "( one difference is that when working to all orders in @xmath50 , scalar pentagon integrals can no longer be eliminated from the set of integrals in terms of which the answer is expressed . )",
    "the identification of dimensional regularization with the introduction of an integrated mass - like vector , @xmath57 , necessitates some discussion .",
    "to begin , we have a @xmath278-dimensional vector , @xmath279 , which we can express as a sum of a four dimensional piece @xmath280 and a remainder @xmath57 , @xmath281 .",
    "it follows that @xmath282 .",
    "here we discuss the properties of @xmath108 .",
    "firstly , some definitions .",
    "we abide by the usual conventions for the dirac algebra , @xmath283 in this equation , @xmath284 and @xmath285 are @xmath286)-dimensional lorentz indices and the metric is @xmath287 .",
    "it follows that , @xmath288 the cross - term vanishes because we have formally chosen @xmath57 to be in a sub - space orthogonal to the four - dimensional subspace containing @xmath280 . without this choice , terms of the form",
    "@xmath289 would exist , significantly complicating our calculations .",
    "the minus sign in going from @xmath290 to @xmath229 is from the metric . for the familiar four - dimensional vector ,",
    "as is conventional , we write @xmath291 .    when the @xmath278-dimensional vector is null , we find that the four - dimensional vector effectively becomes ` massive ' : @xmath292 where we denote a @xmath8-dimensional momentum by a capital letter and a four - dimensional momentum by a lower - case letter . the quantity @xmath229 is always integrated over .",
    "since the metric is diagonal , @xmath108 freely _ anti - commutes _ with four - dimensional @xmath293 matrices , @xmath294 this has an interesting consequence with respect to manipulations with @xmath164 .",
    "we use the conventions of t  hooft and veltman @xcite , and adopt the arbitrary dimension definition , @xmath295 . as usual , @xmath164 _ anti - commutes _ with all the four - dimensional dirac matrices : @xmath296 with respect to @xmath108 , however , @xmath164 freely _ commutes _",
    ", @xmath297 = 0\\ , , \\equn\\ ] ] since @xmath164 is defined in this prescription as a product of an even number of four - dimensional dirac matrices .",
    "the @xmath58-dimensional component , @xmath298 , commutes freely with the helicity projection operator , @xmath299 @xmath300    in our dimensionally regularized cut calculations the momentum of cut fermion lines is to be considered @xmath278 dimensional .",
    "we will borrow the bra and ket symbols to represent the spinors , but as helicity is not a good quantum number we shall not label them with a helicity .",
    "( since we always sum over all states across the cut , there is anyway no need to define a @xmath278 helicity notion . )",
    "these spinors obey the conventional dirac equation , @xmath301 to handle trailing fermions we will use the same expression but in such a case the momenta will be explicitly negative , @xmath302 .",
    "we adhere to the convention that the argument momentum is the momentum flowing in the direction of the fermion arrow .    in sewing the @xmath278-spinors together",
    "( across the cut ) we implicitly sum over the two spin degrees of freedom , that is @xmath303 as mentioned in the text , this notation glosses over the distinction of spinors and anti - spinors and can introduce an overall minus sign that needs to be put back by hand .    having kept a four - dimensional definition for @xmath164 , we can apply spinor - helicity methods @xcite to compress tree amplitudes .",
    "however , some care is required in applying the identity ( [ polslash ] ) . whereas this is the conventional rule for substituting for a slashed polarization vector , it is only a valid identity when the dirac algebra on at least one side is four - dimensional .",
    "for example , for @xmath304 , before applying the rule ( [ polslash ] ) we must first anti - commute each of the @xmath108 to one end of the spinor line . in this way",
    "we pick - up factors of @xmath305 , just as we would combine conventional mass contributions from the fermion propagator .",
    "once we have two neighboring polarization vectors , @xmath306 , we are free to apply the rule ( [ polslash ] ) .      z. bern , l. dixon and d.a .",
