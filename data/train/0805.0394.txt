    ". thus , we can consider partial grnbaum colorings up to rotation and reflection ; the orientation of a triangulation inside the hexagonal face can determine the colors on the edges of the hexagon , which , if they match any rotation / reflection of a partial grnbaum coloring of @xmath75 , will determine a coloring of the remainder of the triangulation .",
    "let us list all possible partial grnbaum colorings of a hexagon , up to rotations and reflections .",
    "we have @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "of these , @xmath136 and @xmath137 appear as part of partial grnbaum colorings of @xmath75 , shown in figure [ 6col ] .",
    "it remains to be shown that if a partial grnbaum coloring of a triangulated hexagon induces any of the other five colorings , there exist kempe changes that render the coloring equivalent to one of the four hexagonal subsets of partial grnbaum colorings of @xmath75 .",
    "now , note that if two colors use exactly 4 hexagon edges , occurring twice each or with all four edges of one color and none of the other , then these four edges behave as those of a square .",
    "that is , the four edges are colored a , c , b@xmath86 , or b@xmath88 .",
    "thus , the proof of lemma [ lemmilesnate2 ] holds , and we may conclude that kempe chains connect only adjacent edges ( where adjacency is considered relative to the  square \" ) and not opposing edges ( where again , adjacency is considered relative to the  square \" ) .",
    "consider each of the five remaining colorings in turn .",
    "for each make a kempe change on the first @xmath77 edge . the same argument as lemma [ lemmilesnate2 ] determines the possible new colorings .",
    "these will either be , or color permute to , a coloring already determined compatible with a partial grnbaum coloring of @xmath75 .",
    "if a partial grnbaum coloring of a triangulated hexagon induces the coloring @xmath133 on the hexagon , make a @xmath139 kempe change on the first @xmath77 edge to obtain @xmath140 , which color - permutes to @xmath137 , or to obtain @xmath141 which color - permutes to @xmath130 .",
    "for the induced hexagon coloring @xmath135 , make a @xmath139 kempe change on the first @xmath77 edge to obtain @xmath141 , or to obtain @xmath140 , which color - permutes to @xmath137 .",
    "for the induced hexagon coloring @xmath132 , make a @xmath139 kempe change on the first @xmath77 edge to obtain @xmath142 , which color - permutes to @xmath143 , which in turn reflects to @xmath135 , or obtain @xmath144 , which color - permutes to @xmath131 . for the induced hexagon coloring @xmath129 , make a @xmath139 kempe change on the first @xmath77 edge to obtain @xmath145 , which color - permutes to @xmath146 , which in turn reflects to @xmath132 , or obtain @xmath147 , which color - permutes to @xmath148 and rotates to @xmath132 . finally , for the induced hexagon coloring @xmath127 , make a @xmath78 kempe change on the first @xmath77 edge to obtain one of @xmath149 , or @xmath130 .",
    "the colorings @xmath128 and @xmath130 are compatible with partial grnbaum colorings of @xmath75 , and @xmath129 was dealt with above .    _",
