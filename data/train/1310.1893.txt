    "each star was observed with the echelle spectrograph of the 3.5  m telescope at apache point observatory , which provides nearly complete optical wavelength coverage at a resolving power of @xmath1 .",
    "the exposure times were designed to yield signal - to - noise ratios of approximately 300:1 . after reducing the data",
    ", we found that 7 stars displayed broad , blended absorption features , making them unsuitable for detailed chemical abundance analyses .",
    "thus , these stars were dropped from the sample , leaving a total of 28 stars . here , we present detailed results for 14 of the 28 .",
    "basic stellar parameters were determined spectroscopically through the usual excitation and ionization analysis and abundances were derived for 15 elements using the latest version of the lte spectral analysis code moog .",
    "our line list includes 53 fe i lines , 6 fe ii lines , and 50 lines from other atomic species carefully chosen to be free from blends and telluric interference .",

    "we have completed a detailed chemical abundance analysis for 14 of the 28 debris disk stars in our sample , deriving basic stellar parameters and abundances for 15 elements .",
    "all stars examined so far exhibit flat or negative slopes in plots of abundance ( [ x / h ] ) versus condensation temperature ( @xmath2 ; taken from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lodders 2003 ) ) , suggesting that the stellar atmospheres have not accreted refractory - rich planetary material . since the sun has been found to be deficient in refractory elements relative to solar twins ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* melndez  2009 ) ) , a result interpreted as a signature of terrestrial planet formation , and since these stars have compositions very similar to the sun ( and in some cases show even more of a deficiency in refractories ) , our results may indicate that planet formation has indeed occurred in these systems , and that the refractory elements are locked up in terrestrial planets or giant planet cores .",
    "beyond completing the analysis for the remaining 14 stars in our sample , we will add abundance measurements for zn since the derived slopes are heavily dependent on the abundances of the few elements with relatively low condensation temperatures ( i.e. , c , o , and s ) .",
    "we will also examine the impact of nlte effects on the c and o abundances for the stars in our sample because , again , these effects could influence the slopes in some non - negligible way ."
