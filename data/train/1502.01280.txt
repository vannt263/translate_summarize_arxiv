    "the orion nebula , the nearest region containing high - mass star formation ( at a distance of only 414pc , menten et al .",
    "2007 ) , is one of the most studied objects in the entire sky . within the orion molecular cloud 1 ( omc1 )",
    "complex , the kleinmann - low ( kl ) nebular harbors one of the most luminous embedded infrared sources ( wynn - williams et al .",
    "the hot core and the intense shocks associated with the ongoing star formation within the massive molecular cloud give rise to very rich and complex chemistry ( e.g. , esplugues et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "orion has been an important target of several spectral - line surveys ( e.g. , sutton et al . 1985 ; turner 1989 ; lee et al .",
    "2001 ; schilke et al .",
    "1997 , 2001 ; lee & cho 2002 ; lerate et al . 2006 ; olofsson , a. et al . 2007 ;",
    "carter et al .",
    "2012 ) , as spectral - line observations are key to disentangling the chemistry and physical processes in star - forming regions .",
    "spectral surveys at 1 mm and shorter wavelengths are complicated by line confusion .",
    "within the 3 mm atmospheric window , astronomical line confusion is less of an issue , and the window contains the fundamental ground - state transitions of several key molecular species .",
    "the 4 mm receiver was commissioned on the robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) in 2012 . in this paper , we present the 6793.6 ghz spectral line survey of orion - kl taken with the new instrument .",
    "the 4 mm receiver is a dual - beam , corrugated feed horn receiver that covers the frequency range of approximately 6793 ghz .",
    "the system is a single - side band receiver , and both feeds are within the cold cryostat ( 15k ) . the first version of the 4 mm receiver ( white et al .",
    "2012 ) used a modified version of the w - band low - noise amplifiers ( lnas ) originally built for the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( pospieszalski et al .",
    "this receiver exhibited noise temperatures better than 80k over much of the frequency band and was used during the initial observing season ( through the summer of 2012 ) . in the fall of 2012 ,",
    "the receiver was upgraded with lnas developed for this band with more modern inp high - electron - mobility transistor ( hemt ) devices ( pospieszalski 2012 , bryerton at al .",
    "the upgraded amplifiers reduced the receiver noise to 40k over much of the band .    unlike other receivers on the gbt , there are no noise diodes for calibration with the 4 mm receiver .",
    "the receiver has an optical wheel external to the cryostat that is used for calibration .",
    "the wheel also contains a quarter - wave plate for the conversion of linear polarization into circular polarization for very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations . for calibration",
    ", the wheel has an ambient temperature load ( @xmath0 that is monitored by a sensor ) and an offset mirror used to view an internal cold load that has a stable effective temperature ( @xmath1 ) , which is derived from laboratory measurements . for calibration ,",
    "the table is rotated to place the cold and ambient loads into each of the beams with alternating observations . using the known temperatures of the loads , the effective gains (",
    "@xmath2 [ kelvin / volt ] ) of the system are measured .",
    "orion - kl was observed using the 4 mm receiver on the gbt ( project gbt12a_364 ) during four observational sessions between 2012 may 30 and 2012 june 15 . the observed position of orion - kl was @xmath3 , @xmath4 , corresponding to the bright continuum peak ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we adopt a source lsr velocity of @xmath5 ( turner 1989 ) .",
    "the observations were taken in position - switched mode with alternating 1 minute on and 1 minute off scans , using beam-1 of the receiver with both linear polarization channels .",
    "the off position was offset by one degree in right ascension and at the same declination as orion - kl .",
    "twelve individual setups using the wide - bandwidth mode of the gbt spectrometer ( see gbt proposer s guide ) were used to carry out the survey with a channel resolution of 0.39 mhz ( @xmath6 ) . in total , 38 overlapping",
    "800 mhz spectrometer windows separated by 700 mhz were used to cover the full frequency range of 67.0 ghz to 93.6 ghz . for each frequency set up , a sequence of 10 on - off pairs of orion - kl observations were carried out along with short calibration scans of the cold and ambient loads before and after the target observations .",
    "the observations for each setup were repeated twice , resulting in a nominal total integration time of 20 minutes of on - source data per frequency ( 20 on - off pairs ) .",
    "observations of jupiter and the nearby quasar 0423@xmath70120 were used to derive pointing and focus corrections every hour .",
    "representative daytime pointing offsets during the observing sessions were @xmath8 which is a smaller than the 10 - 13@xmath9 beam and much smaller than the orion complex which shows strong emission over 1 - 3 arc - minutes .",
    "given the extended source size , most of the observations were done without the `` autooof '' measurements that are used to provide the thermal corrections to the active surface ( see gbt documentation for a description of autooof ) .",
    "in contrast , optimal point - source observations should be carried out with regular autooof measurements during the nighttime when the thermal stability of the dish is best .",
    "based on commissioning tests with the 4 mm receiver , the autooof corrections improve the point - source aperture efficiency by 30% or more .",
    "application of these corrections during the day are not typically practical for the 4 mm receiver given that the thermal environment of the dish is generally not sufficiently stable . during the day , the measured beam size was found to vary significantly ( e.g. , 10@xmath10 ) , but the beam shape remained well - behaved ( fairly symmetric and gaussian ) .",
    "although the variation of beam size has a direct impact on the point - source aperture efficiency ( @xmath11 ) , it has little impact on the effective main - beam efficiency ( @xmath12 ) used for the calibration of extended sources .",
    "for example during the commissioning of the instrument , we measured a beam size of @xmath13 at 77 ghz and derived @xmath14% and @xmath15% in good nighttime conditions with the application of the thermal autooof surface corrections .",
    "without the autooof corrections , the beam - size increased to 12@xmath16 and the aperture efficiency decreased to 23% , but the main - beam efficiency remained nearly constant at about 50% . given the insensitivity of @xmath12 for extended source emission , we adopt the main - beam temperature scale @xmath17 for the calibration of the data .",
    "the main - beam temperature @xmath17 is computed from the observed antenna temperature @xmath18 using the relationship @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the zenith opacity , @xmath21 is the airmass , and @xmath12 is the main - beam efficiency . the opacity is derived from the weather database for green bank which successfully forecasts the opacity as a function of frequency and time with an accuracy of @xmath22 ( maddalena 2010a ) .",
    "for the four observational sessions , the zenith opacity varied only slightly ( @xmath230.03 ) .",
    "the opacity variations contribute less than 3% to the total error budget of @xmath17 .",
    "the antenna temperature for each on - off scan pair is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the single - side - band system temperature and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the measured voltages of the on and off scans .",
    "the calibration scans are used to measure the gain ( @xmath2 ) and compute the system temperature for the off scan ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "based on the known temperatures ( @xmath29 ) and measured voltages ( @xmath30 ) of the ambient ( @xmath31 ) and cold loads , the gain is given by @xmath32.\\ ] ]    we adopt the median value of @xmath25 across each spectral window in calibrating the spectra using equation ( 2 ) .",
    "this is referred to `` scalar '' calibration within gbt documentation and contrasts to `` vector '' calibration which uses @xmath25 computed as a function frequency .",
    "currently for the 800mhz spectral windows , scalar calibration gives significantly better baseline performance than vector calibration for the 4 mm receiver .    assuming a gaussian beam , the main - beam efficiency is given by @xmath33 where @xmath11 is the aperture efficiency , @xmath34 is the full - width half - maximum beam size in radians , d is the diameter of the gbt ( 100 m ) , and @xmath35 is the observed wavelength ( maddalena 2010b ) . the applicability of this equation was confirmed directly by integrating the intensity profiles taken during the pointing scans . based on measurements as a function of frequency , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the frequency in ghz .",
    "observations of 3c279 in 2012 march were used to measure the aperture efficiency . for the gbt , @xmath38 .",
    "based on available measurements from the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) and the combined array for research millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) , the derived flux density for 3c279 at the time of the gbt observations was @xmath39jy . the corresponding derived aperture efficiency at 77 ghz is @xmath40% .",
    "this efficiency is consistent with net surface errors of @xmath41 using the ruze equation : @xmath42,\\ ] ] where the coefficient 0.71 is the aperture efficiency at long wavelengths for the gbt .",
    "adopting @xmath41 , equation ( 5 ) was used to compute @xmath11 as a function of wavelength .",
    "the calibration results based on 3c279 at 77 ghz were confirmed within measurement errors with additional observations of mars at 77 ghz ( 2012 march ) , 3c84 at 89 ghz ( 2013 december ) , and 0927 + 392 at 89 ghz ( 2013 march ) . in terms of absolute flux calibration , there is some degeneracy between the uncertainty of the temperature of the cold load and the derived aperature efficiency , and hence @xmath17 .",
    "the effective temperature of the the cold load derived in the lab is known to within 10% , which corresponds to a 2.5% uncertainty in @xmath17 .",
    "the uncertainty in the cold load contributes negligibly to the total error budget in comparison to the measurement errors of the astronomical observations .",
    "factoring all known sources of errors , the estimated uncertainty on the calibrated @xmath17 temperature scale is 17% .",
    "the observational parameters as a function of frequency are given in table  1 .",
    "the measured system temperature , aperture efficiency , and main - beam efficiency are shown in figure  2 .",
    "after data editing , removing a low - order polynomial baseline , and combining the data for both polarizations and observing sessions , the resulting empirical noise level per 0.39mhz channel is 2040mk over most of the frequency range .",
    "the 38 calibrated overlapping spectrometer windows were spliced together to form a data set comprising of 68,096 frequencies and @xmath17 values ( table  2 ) .",
    "the complete tabulated data set is available as supplemental online material from the journal .",
    "figure  3 displays the entire data set ploted on a logrithmic scale . to show the typical noise properties and baseline quality of the data , an example portion of the survey",
    "is plotted as figure  4 .",
    "overlapping spectra separated by 0.5 ghz for the entire survey are provided in the supplemental online material ( fig .",
    "the data are fairly clean , but a few artifacts remain in the data from atmospheric o@xmath43 and radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) . table  3 lists the frequency of data features that are not associated with orion - kl . the `` p - cygni '' profiles from o@xmath43 result from position - switching .",
    "separate frequency - switched observations were carried out to verify the association of these features with broad atmospheric o@xmath43 lines .",
    "the detected spectral lines were fitted with a gaussian using the gbtidl _ fitgauss _ routine .",
    "below 1k the data are very rich , and the identifications of weak features become challenging in many cases due to blended transitions and the associated with multiple possible species . in table  4 , we provide the results of fitting the brightest features ( @xmath44k ) . in total , we tabulate measurements for 140 lines brighter than 1k .",
    "these measurements represent only a small fraction of 727 spectral features detected in the data .",
    "the species associate with each of the lines in table  4 were identified using the spectral line catalogs given within splatalogue which is based on several spectroscoptic databases ( mller et al .",
    "2005 ; prickett et al . 1998 ; lovas & dragoset 2004 ) . for each line",
    ", we list the most likely species . for the bright lines listed in table  4 , only one feature was not identified .",
    "this transition was measured at @xmath45k at an observed frequency of 81.756ghz .",
    "species with cataloged transitions closest in the frequency to this unidentified line include c - hcooh ( formic acid ) , h@xmath43nch@xmath43cn ( aminoacetonitrile ) , ch@xmath46coch@xmath46 ( acetone ) , and ch@xmath43nd , but none of these possible identifications seem particularly compelling due to significant velocity offsets or the lack of other detected transitions associated with the species .",
    "the vast majority of the spectral lines detected are associated with the cooler molecular gas regions consistent with velocities of @xmath47 and widths of about @xmath48 , or with the `` hot core '' region with @xmath49 and widths of about @xmath50 ( sutton et al .",
    "the so@xmath43 features show an additional broad component that may be associated with a strong outflow in the system ( e.g. , wright et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the spectral lines observed with the 100-meter gbt are typically a few to more than 10 times brighter than those previously measured by the much smaller nrao 36 foot telescope ( turner 1989 ) , and the brightest lines ( e.g. , sio and hcn ) observed with the gbt also tend to be brighter than those observed with the iram 30 m ( carter et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the variations in line strengths from different telescopes highlight the effects of beam dilution and filling factor effects where the observed intensity from small emission regions decreases with an increasing telescope beam size .",
    "however , many species also show good agreement in their observed line strengths .",
    "we find similar line strengths within measurement errors between the tabulated 30 m measurements ( esplugues et al .",
    "2013 ; tercero et al .",
    "2010 ) and those presented in table  4 from the gbt for the so , @xmath51so , so@xmath43 , and ocs transitions .",
    "these results suggest that the emission from these species are extended over both the 30 m and gbt beams .",
    "the interpretation of line strengths is also complicated due to the multiple overlapping components of the orion complex ( extended ridge , compact ridge , plateau , and hot core ; e.g. , tercero et al .",
    "telescopes with different beam sizes will not observe the exact same portion of the orion complex in a single pointing .",
    "high - spatial resolution mapping observations would be useful in disentangling the relative line strengths from the different components in orion given that the components also have similar velocities ( e.g. , widicus weaver & friedel 2012 ; brouillet et al .",
    "in this paper we present the 6793.6 ghz spectral - line survey of orion - kl taken with the gbt . the full spectrum is available electronically .",
    "we tabulate spectral - line measurements for features brighter than @xmath44k , but features as weak as 10mk are identifiable in the data .",
    "the survey targeted the bright continuum peak of orion - kl .",
    "many molecules are known to have strong emission elsewhere within orion ( e.g. , peng et al .",
    "2013 ) , and the gbt beam of @xmath52 would be well - suited for mapping the distribution of molecular emission throughout the orion complex .    given the large collecting area of the gbt , the improved accuracy of the surface , and the excellent performance of the optimized lnas , the gbt 4 mm system is the most sensitive facility in the world for this band .",
    "within the over - lapping frequency range of alma band-3 , the gbt system can achieve better system temperatures in spite of the higher opacity associated with the lower elevation of the green bank site . with the multi - pixel instruments currently under development ( e.g. , argus , sieth et al .",
    "2014 ; mustang-2 , dicker et al .",
    "2014 ) , the mapping speed within this band using the gbt would be unparalleled .",
    "we thank our colleagues at green bank and at the nrao central development lab who have made these observations possible .",
    "we thank simon dicker and brian mason for sharing the gbt mustang data shown in figure  1 .",
