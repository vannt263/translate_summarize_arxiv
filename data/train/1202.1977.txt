    "more recently , based on a new recoil formula , lousto & zlochower ( 2011b ) have estimated that recoil velocities up to 5000 km / s can be reached in configurations with spins partially aligned with the orbital angular momentum . in unbound encounters ( not likely to occur in astrophysical environments )",

    "after the kick , the recoiling smbh will oscillate about the core of its host galaxy ( madau & quataert 2004 , gualandris & merritt 2008 ) or will even escape , if its kick velocity exceeds the escape velocity of its host . in a `` typical '' , gas - poor galaxy , a black hole kick velocity of 500 km / s will result in an initial amplitude of @xmath0200 pc , and an oscillation timescale of order 10@xmath1 yrs ( fig . 1 of komossa & merritt 2008b ) . the kicks , including those large enough to remove smbhs from their host galaxies , have potentially far - reaching astrophysical consequences , including for smbh and galaxy assembly and agn statistics .",

    "is of great interest .",
    "several key electromagnetic signatures of kicks have been predicted in the last few years , and first candidate recoiling smbhs have emerged .",
    "this chapter is structured as follows . in section 2 , an overview of the predicted electromagnetic signatures of recoiling smbhs",
    "is given . in sect .",
    "3 the event frequency is discussed , while sects 4 and 5 provides a review of the published candidate recoiling smbhs .",
    "explores consequences of recoil for unified models of agn . sect .",
    "7 concludes with some astrophysical consequences and important future studies .",
    "after the kick , matter remains bound to the recoiling smbh within a region whose radius @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the kick velocity ( merritt et al .",
    "this region is on the order of the size of the broad line region ( blr ) of agn ( peterson 2007 ) .",
    "the accretion disk and blr will therefore typically remain bound to the smbh while the bulk of the host galaxy s narrow - line region ( nlr ) will remain behind .",
    "the accreting recoiling smbh will therefore appear as an off - nuclear `` quasar '' as long as its accretion supply lasts .",
    "however , spatial off - sets are challenging to detect even with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) except in the nearby universe .",
    "the kinematic doppler shifts of the broad emission lines are , in principle , easy to measure out to high redshifts .",
    "spectroscopically , recoiling smbhs will appear as agn which have their broad emission lines kinematically shifted by up to @xmath5 km / s with respect to their nlrs .    bonning et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested several criteria , how to identify a recoiling smbh spectroscopically .",
    "apart from ( 1 ) the kinematic shift of the blr , a candidate recoiling smbh should ( 2 ) show symmetric broad line profiles , it should ( 3 ) lack an ionization stratification of its narrow emission lines , and it should ( 4 ) not show any shift between broad mgii and the broad balmer lines .",
    "one object , the quasar sdssj092712.65 + 294344.0 , fulfills all of these four criteria and is therefore an excellent candidate for a recoiling smbh ( komossa et al .",
    "it will be further discussed in section 4 , together with several other candidate recoiling bhs .",
    "more candidates may hide in large samples of peculiar broad - line emitters recently identified in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; eracleous et al .",
    "2011 ) .      in gas - rich mergers ,",
    "an accretion disk is likely present , even though the inner part of the disk may only re - form after binary coalescence ( liu et al . 2003 ,",
    "milosavljevi & phinney 2005 , loeb 2007 , ponce et al .",
    "uv , soft x - ray , and ir flares could result from shocks in the accretion disk surrounding the smbh just after recoil , or when the inner disk reforms ( e.g. , lippai et al . 2008 , shields & bonning 2008 , schnittman & krolik 2008 , megevand et al . 2009 , rossi et al . 2010 , corrales et al . 2010 , tanaka et al .",
    "2010 , zanotti et al .",
    "2011 , ponce et al .",
    "these flares may last @xmath610@xmath7 yrs and may be detectable in current and future sky surveys .      even in the absence of an accretion disk , ejected smbhs will always carry a retinue of bound stars .",
    "observable effects related to these stars are therefore perhaps the most universal signature of recoil . as the smbh moves through the galaxy ,",
    "the bound , and unbound , stars are subject to tidal disruption , leading to powerful x - ray flares of quasar - like luminosity ( komossa & bade 1999 , bloom et al .",
    "2011 ) , which would appear off - nuclear or even intergalactic .",
    "komossa & merritt ( 2008a , km08 hereafter ) computed disruption rates for the bound , and the unbound , stellar populations under recoil conditions . in the resonant relaxation regime , they showed that the rates are of order @xmath8 yr@xmath9 for a typical postmerger galaxy ( fig . 2 of km08 )",
    "; smaller than , but comparable to , rates for non - recoiling smbhs . at an early phase of recoil , the tidal disruption rate can be much higher , when the smbh experiences a full loss - cone , and travels through the clumpy core environment of a recent merger ( km08 ) .",
    "the flare rate may temporarily reach values as high ( stone & loeb 2011 ) as during the peak of the pre - merger binary phase ( chen et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "another signature related to the stars bound to the recoiling smbh is episodic x - ray emission from accretion due to stellar mass loss .",
    "mass loss provides a reservoir of gas , and therefore also _ optical emission lines from gas at the recoil velocity _ even in the initial absence of a gaseous accretion disk .",
    "other consequences include the presence of intergalactic planetary nebulae and supernovae , after the ejected smbh has left its host galaxy ( km08 ) .",
    "all these signals would generically be associated with recoiling smbhs , whether or not the galaxy merger is gas - rich or dry , and whether or not an accretion disk is present initially , and they would continue episodically for a time of @xmath10 gyr ( km08 )",
    ".      while the `` tidal recoil flares '' are very luminous and can be detected out to very large distances , the compact system of bound stars itself will be detectable in the nearby universe , and would resemble a globular cluster in total luminosity , but with a much greater velocity dispersion due to the large binding mass @xmath11 ( komossa & merritt 2008a ) .",
    "merritt et al . ( 2009 ) worked out the properties of these `` hypercompact stellar systems '' ( hcss ) , and related the structural properties ( mass , size , and density profile ) of hcsss to the properties of their host galaxies and to the amplitude of the kick .",
    "since the kick velocity is encoded in the velocity dispersion of the bound stars , future detection of large samples of hcsss would therefore allow us to determine empirically the kick distribution , and therefore the merger history of galaxies in clusters .",
    "nearby clusters of galaxies are best suited to search for and identify hcsss , and @xmath0100 of them should be detectable within 2 mpc of the center of the virgo cluster ( merritt et al . 2009 ) .",
    "depending on the merger history of our milky way ( oleary & loeb 2009 ) , and the merger history of black holes in its globular clusters ( holley - bockelmann et al .",
    "2008 ) , 100s of low - mass hcsss and rogue black holes may reside in the halo of our milky way , and a search for them is underway ( oleary & loeb 2011 ) .      during the long - lived `` phase ii ''",
    "recoil oscillations ( gualandris & merritt 2008 ) , when the smbh oscillation amplitude is on the torus scale , the smbh might efficiently accrete from the dense molecular gas at _ each _ turning point , causing repeated flares of radiation ( komossa & merritt 2008b ) .",
    "such flares would locally destroy the dust , while photoionization of the dense surrounding gas would produce a strong emission - line response .",
    "such a signal would not only help in identifying kicks but could also be used as a new probe of the properties of the torus itself .",
    "other signatures of recoiling smbhs include effects on the morphology and dynamics of the gaseous disk of the host galaxy ( kornreich & lovelace 2008 ) , their imprints on the hot gas in early - type galaxies ( devecchi et al .",
    "2009 ) , accretion from the ism ( fujita 2009 ) , the possibility of star formation in the wake of the smbh trajectory ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2008 ) , and their influence on the jet structures in radio galaxies ( liu et al .",
    "several factors affect the distribution of smbh kick velocities and their observability ; the system parameters of the smbh binary on the one hand ( mass ratio , spin magnitudes and spin directions ) , and the astrophysical environment on the other hand .",
    "the frequency of high - velocity kicks depends on the distribution of mass ratios and spins of the binary smbhs . in case of random distributions of spin directions , as expected in gas - poor galaxy mergers , the kick formula ( e.g. , campanelli et al .",
    "2007 , baker et al .",
    "2008 , lousto & zlochower 2009 ) has been used to predict the kick fraction in dependence of recoil velocity ( campanelli et al .",
    "2007 , schnittman & buonanno 2007 , baker et al .",
    "2008 , komossa & merritt 2008b ) . in this case , kicks with velocities larger than 500 km / s are relatively common ( fig . 1 of komossa & merritt 2008b ) .",
    "spin precession further has the consequence that large kicks are deboosted if the angle @xmath12 between the spin of the more massive bh and the orbital angular momentum is initially small , while large kicks are boosted , if @xmath12 is initially large ( kesden et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the other key factor is the astrophysical environment , which determines the spin magnitude ( set by the mechanism of smbh mass growth via random accretion , ordered accretion , or bh - bh merging ; volenteri et al . 2007 ) and the timescale of spin alignment with the orbital angular momentum ( e.g. , scheuer & feiler 1996 , natarajan & armitage 1999 , bogdanovi et al .",
    "2007 ) in gas - rich galaxy mergers .",
    "the latter depends on the rapidity of binary coalescence , the amount of gas accretion before versus after coalescence , the accretion rate , the disk properties ( e.g. , the viscosity law across the disk ) , and the mass of the smbh . while the most massive black holes are more resistent to alignment , the process is generally relatively fast in gas rich environments ( timescales of 10@xmath1310@xmath14 yrs or less ; perego et al .",
    "2009 , dotti et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "while initial results from numerical relativity have indicated that kick velocities are low in this case , the whole parameter space is still being explored , and lousto & zlochower ( 2011b ) have recently shown that kick velocities up to 5000 km / s can be reached in configurations with spins partially aligned with the orbital angular momentum . as a consequence ,",
    "the likelihood of observing high - velocity recoils in gas - rich environments is significantly higher than in some previous estimates ( their fig .",
    "3 ) .    given the large number of uncertain parameters in estimating the frequency of recoiling smbhs , identifying them through observations is also important .",
    "ultimately , observations will independently provide the distribution of kick velocities and the properties of the recoiling smbhs .",
    "first candidates have emerged in recent years , and more are likely to come soon , given the number of operating or planned very large spectroscopic and time - domain surveys , like sdss , lamost , lsst , and future x - ray surveys .",
    "the quasar sdssj092712.65 + 294344.0 ( sdssj0927 + 2943 hereafter ; komossa et al .",
    "2008 , kzl08 hereafter ) at @xmath15=0.7 shows all the characteristic optical signatures of a recoiling smbh , which were predicted by bonning et al .",
    "( 2007 ) : its broad emission lines are shifted by 2650 km s@xmath9 with respect to its narrow emission lines , the broad lines are symmetric , the broad mgii line shows the same shift as the broad balmer lines , and the narrow emission lines lack an ionization stratification as expected if the accreting smbh is no longer at the center of the system ( kzl08 ) .",
    "its unique properties make sdssj0927 + 2943 an excellent candidate for a recoiling smbh .",
    "two alternative models have been considered in order to explain some ( but not all ) of the unusual properties of this system ; a chance projection , within 1 arcsec , of one or _",
    "two _ _ intrinsically peculiar _ agn in a very massive cluster of galaxies ( kzl08 , shields et al .",

    "2009 ) .",
    "we have obtained an imaging observation of sdssj0927 + 2943 with the @xmath16 x - ray observatory , in order to measure more precisely its x - ray luminosity ( than was possible with a serendipituous off - axis rosat observation ; kzl08 ) , and to study the properties of the field around sdssj0927 + 2943 , including the search for a possible massive cluster of galaxies .",

    "if still related to recoil , in form of a marginally bound or unbound component of the blr , the system is young , and robinson et al . then estimate an age of @xmath010@xmath7 years .",

    "( 2009 ) selected the quasar sdssj105041.35 + 345631.3 at @xmath15 = 0.272 from the sdss because of its large kinematic shift of the blr of , in this case , 3500 km / s relative to the narrow emission lines .",
    "a projection effect is considered unlikely , as is a binary smbh because of the lack of detectable orbital motion . while shields et al .",
    "do not rule out an extreme case of a recoiling smbh , they conclude that several aspects of the optical spectrum are best understood if this galaxy is an extreme case of a `` double - peaked emitter '' .",
    "the galaxy cid-42 ( cosmosj1000 + 0206 ) at redshift @xmath15=0.359 was discovered in the cosmos survey ( elvis 2009 ) , and caught attention due to its unusual morphology with two apparent optical `` nuclei '' ( comerford et al .",

    "initially suspected to be a binary agn ( comerford et al .",

    "an hst image analysis has shown that the north - western core is slightly extended though compact , and consistent with being the nucleus of the galaxy , while only the south - eastern bright source is point - like ( civano et al 2010 ) .",
    "the optical spectrum of cid 42 shows a kinematic shift of 1200 km / s between the blr and the major narrow - line component , and extra faint narrow h@xmath17 emission at the same redshift as the broad lines ( civano et al .",
    "2010 ) , and perhaps further faint narrow - line emission shifted by @xmath0150 km / s ( comerford et al .",
    "2009 ) . as such , the spectrum shares similarities with that of the recoil candidate sdssj092712.65 + 294344.0 ( komossa et al .",
    "2008 , shields et al .",
    "another remarkable feature , not yet well understood , is the presence of a strong redshifted broad iron line with a p - cygni profile , variable over four years , of high column density and highly ionized ( civano et al .",

    "@xmath19 imaging has revealed the presence of a compact source embedded in an extended `` stellar stream '' ( keeney et al .",

    "discuss several possible interpretations of this compact object , and propose that it is the actual nucleus of the galaxy , ejected as a consequence of either tidal interaction between two galaxies or gravitational wave recoil following a past merger .",
    "there are potentially far - reaching consequences of smbh recoil for unified models of agn .",
    "spatial oscillations of the smbhs about the cores of their host galaxies imply that the smbhs spend a significant fraction of time _ off - nucleus _ , at scales beyond that of the molecular obscuring torus .",
    "an intrinsically _ obscured _ quasar of _ type 2 _ with its blr hidden by the torus will therefore appear as _ unabsorbed , type 1 _ quasar during the recoil oscillations , when moving beyond the torus scale .",
    "assuming reasonable distributions of recoil velocities , komossa & merritt ( 2008b ) have computed the off - core timescale of ( intrinsically type-2 ) quasars .",
    "it was shown that roughly 50% of all major mergers result in a smbh being displaced beyond the torus for a time of @xmath20 yr or more .",
    "this is an interesting number , because it is comparable to quasar activity time scales . since _",
    "major _ mergers ( i.e. , quasars ) are most strongly affected by gravitational wave recoil , our results imply a deficiency of luminous type 2 _ quasars _ in comparison to low - luminosity _ seyfert _ 2 galaxies , as indeed observed ( e.g. , hasinger 2008 ) .",
    "these may therefore naturally explain the long - standing puzzle , why few absorbed type 2 quasars exist at high luminosities ; it would be these which are affected by the recoil oscillations , therefore appearing as type 1 rather than type 2 for a significant fraction of their lifetime ( komossa & merritt 2008b ) .    recoil oscillations further imply the presence of a fraction of quasars which lack a hot dust component , because the dusty torus is only illuminated from a distance .",
    "such `` hot - dust - poor '' quasars have indeed been observed ( e.g. , hao et al . 2011 ) .    recoil oscillations also have a number of other observable consequences related to agn .",
    "for instance , they will affect the x - ray background and its modeling since a fraction of sources will be unobscured at any given time .",
    "in particular , small amplitude oscillations of the order the torus size will affect the ratio of compton - thin to compton - thick sources , and could lead to measurable variability in the absorption and extinction of agn spectra once the recoiling smbh passes the individual clouds making up the torus ( komossa & merritt 2008b ) .",
    "the kicks and superkicks predicted by recent numerical relativity simulations of coalescing smbhs have stimulated an active new field of research .",
    "electromagnetic signatures of recoiling smbhs are being predicted , several candidates have emergerd in large data bases , and astrophysical implications of the kicks are still being explored .",
    "the fact that smbhs will not always reside at the very cores of their host galaxies , or may even be ejected completely , has many potential implications for the topics discussed in this book ; for galaxy and smbh assembly and galaxy - smbh ( co-)evolution , core structures in early type galaxies , the scatter in the host galaxy ",
