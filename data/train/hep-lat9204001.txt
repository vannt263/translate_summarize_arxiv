    "<S> we present a recursive procedure to calculate the parameters of the recently introduced multicanonical ensemble and explore the approach for spin glasses . </S>",
    "<S> temperature dependence of the energy , the entropy and other physical quantities are easily calculable and we report results for the zero temperature limit . our data provide evidence that the large @xmath0 increase of the ergodicity time is greatly improved . </S>",
    "<S> the multicanonical ensemble seems to open new horizons for simulations of spin glasses and other systems which have to cope with conflicting constraints .    </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical understanding of spin glasses , for a review see @xcite , has remained a great challenge . in particular the low temperature limit leaves many open questions about the effects of disorder and frustration . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it has remained controversial whether parisi s @xcite mean field theory provides the appropriate description for 3d spin glasses . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive alternative is the droplet model @xcite , which in turn is equivalent to a one parameter scaling picture @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest spin glass system to study such questions numerically is the edwards - anderson model . in its ising version </S>",
    "<S> it is described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where the sum goes over nearest neighbours and the exchange interactions @xmath2 between the spins @xmath3 are quenched random variables . in our investigation </S>",
    "<S> we impose the constraint @xmath4 for each realization . </S>",
    "<S> recent simulations @xcite of the 3d model in a magnetic field support the mean field picture . </S>",
    "<S> however , one may argue that sufficiently low temperatures on sufficiently large systems have not been reached . for previous simulations of the edwards - anderson model without magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> low temperature simulations of spin glasses suffer from a slowing down due to energy barriers . to illustrate the problem , let us consider a simple ferromagnet : the 2d ising model on an @xmath5 lattice . </S>",
    "<S> in figure  1 we give its magnetic probability density versus @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the two distinct branches below the curie temperature are associated with free energy valleys in configuration space , each of which defines a ( pure ) thermodynamic state . at temperatures below the curie point </S>",
    "<S> the ergodicity </S>",
    "<S> time@xmath7 @xmath8 increases exponentially fast with lattice size , asymptotically like @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath10 is the surface free energy . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> on large lattices at sufficiently low temperature the simulation of the system will , given a reasonable finite amount of computer time , never tunnel from one phase to the other . </S>",
    "<S> besides for particular problems ( like the determination of the order - order surface free energy ) this lack of tunneling does not pose a major handicap for ising model simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the two configuration space valleys are related by the exact symmetry @xmath11 of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> exploring one valley by means of a simulation yields also all the properties of the other one and , hence , allows to overlook the entire system .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation is much more involved for spin glasses . for low enough temperature </S>",
    "<S> the system is supposed to split of into many thermodynamic states , separated by similar tunneling barriers as the two pure states of the ising model . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike in the ising model the states are not related to each other by a symmetry of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> rather they appear because of accidental degeneracy which in turn occurs because of randomness and frustration of the system . for computer simulations </S>",
    "<S> this means that one would like to explore many independent configuration space valleys while keeping track of their relative weights . </S>",
    "<S> the groundstate energies associated with these valleys may or may not be degenerate , but it should be noted that even if they are not degenerate , tunneling between the valleys would still be governed by the energy barriers . </S>",
    "<S> the physics of these barriers is far less well understood as in the ferromagnetic case . as detailed finite size </S>",
    "<S> scaling ( fss ) studies do not exist , it is unclear to us to what extent these barriers depend on the system size , whereas the temperature dependence has been investigated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use the notation bifurcation temperature ( bifurcation point ) for the temperature at which the spin glass configuration space ( phase transition or not ) begins to split of into a number of valleys which are well separated by energy barriers . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the increase of @xmath12 can be reduced to a fairly decent power law by performing a simulation which covers in a single ensemble a whole temperature range from well above to far below the bifurcation point . </S>",
    "<S> the appropriate formulation is provided by a generalization of the multicanonical ensemble @xcite . to test the approach we have performed multicanonical simulations of the 2d ising ferromagnet and then of the 2d edward - anderson ising spin glass model . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on ground state properties what is a kind of worst case scenario for the performance of the multicanonical simulation . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that figure  1 does rely on a multicanonical simulation , what explains the slight asymmetry between the two branches .    ever since the pioneering paper by metropolis et al.@xcite most mc simulations concentrated on importance sampling for the canonical gibbs ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> it has always been well - known , for instance @xcite , that one is allowed to choose phase - space points according to any other probability distribution , if it is convenient . </S>",
    "<S> however , a systematic reasoning for a better than canonical choice has rarely been put forward@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> it is our suggestion that in a large class of situations , in particular those where canonical simulations face severe ergodicity problems , it is more efficient to reconstruct the gibbs ensemble from a simulation of a multicanonical ensemble @xcite than simulating it directly . in canonical simulations configurations </S>",

    "<S> _ ii _ ) the normalization constant @xmath55 in equation ( 5 ) follows from @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the total number of spin variables . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the spectral density and allows to calculate the free energy as well as the entropy .    </S>",
    "<S> _ iii _ ) we conjecture that the slowing down of canonical low temperature spin glass simulations becomes greatly reduced . for the multicanonical ensemble it can be argued @xcite that single spin updates cause a 1d random walk behaviour of the energy @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath58 , one needs @xmath59 updating steps to cover the entire ensemble . for first order phase transition </S>",
    "<S> the observed slowing down was only slightly worse than this optimal behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> our present mc data show more drastic modifications for spin glass simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> to quantify our discussion of the slowing down , we have to define the ergodicity time @xmath12 . roughly speaking it is the cpu time needed to collect independent configurations of the system , for instance groundstates when this is the main interest . </S>",
    "<S> regarding the definition of @xmath12 , an @xmath0-independent over - all factor is free . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath12 as the average number of sweeps needed to move the energy from @xmath60 to @xmath61 and back . </S>",
    "<S> a sweep is defined by updating each spin on the lattice once ( in the average ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the number of `` tunneling '' events with respect to the ergodicity time gives a lower bound on the number of independent groundstates samples . </S>",
    "<S> this follows from another trivial , but remarkable property of the multicanonical ensemble : each time a sweep is spent at @xmath62 , the memory of the previous markov chain is lost entirely , and a truly independent new series of configurations follows . </S>",
    "<S> the condition @xmath63 is appropriate to substitute for the somewhat too strict constraint of a sweep at @xmath64 . as a corollary : with a disordered starting configuration the multicanonical ensemble is immediately in equilibrium .    as an exercise and to check our code on exact results , we performed a multicanonical simulation of the 2d ising model with @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> we kept the time series of two million sweeps and measurements on a @xmath66 lattice and verified that the finite lattice specific heat results of ferdinand and fisher @xcite are well reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> no difficulties are encountered with the multicanonical ensemble when crossing the phase transition point . to explore the possibility of zero temperature entropy calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we used @xmath67 as input and obtained @xmath68 for the total groundstate entropy . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to an estimate of @xmath69 groundstates , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ within statistical errors we are in agreement with two . using @xmath70 and a time series of four million sweeps on a @xmath5 lattice we obtained @xmath71 for the number of groundstates . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 is obtained from the simulation of this lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> after this test we turned to the 2d edwards - anderson spin glass . on lattices of size </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 , 12 , 24 and 48 we performed multicanonical simulations . up </S>",
    "<S> to @xmath73 we investigated ten different realizations per lattice and , due to cpu time constraints , we considered only five realizations for the @xmath74 lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the multicanonical energy distribution for one of our @xmath74 realizations is depicted in figure  2 . </S>",
    "<S> the fall - off for @xmath75 is like that of the canonical distribution at @xmath76 . for @xmath77 an impressive flatness </S>",
    "<S> ( about 800 energy entries on the lattice under consideration ) is quickly achieved by the recursion ( 6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> close to the groundstate some fluctuations are encountered on which we comment elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as it is not obvious from the scale of the figure , we like to remark that the groundstate is not the state with the lowest number of entries , but a state close to it . </S>",
    "<S> further , it should be understood that deviations from the desired constant behaviour ( 5 ) do only influence the statistical error bars , but not the estimates themselves . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , such deviations do not pose problems as long as they can be kept within reasonable limits of approximately one order of magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> the table gives an overview of some of our numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> the ergodicity time @xmath12 is as defined above , and for @xmath78 we take @xmath79 , where it should be noted that due to our computational procedure @xmath18 is a noisy function . </S>",
    "<S> the reported values and their error bars are obtained by combining the results from the different realizations , which enter with equal weights . in figure 3 </S>",
    "<S> we plot the ergodicity time versus lattice size @xmath0 on a log  log scale . </S>",
    "<S> the data are consistent with a straight line fit ( @xmath80 denotes the goodness of fit ) , which gives the finite size behaviour @xmath81 in cpu time this corresponds to a slowing down @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be remarked that a fit of form @xmath83 results in a completely unacceptable goodness of fit @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> still , the behaviour ( 8) is by an extra volume factor worse than the close to optimal performance we hoped for . the reasons will be considered elsewhere @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> ._overview of some results . for the data points marked with </S>",
    "<S> * the statistics for different realizations varies somewhat and average values are given . </S>",
    "<S> _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we estimate the infinite volume groundstate energy and entropy from fss fits of the form @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy fit is depicted in figure  4 , and the energy fit looks similar . </S>",
    "<S> our energy estimate is @xmath86 , consistent with the previous mc estimate @xcite @xmath87 as well as with the transfer matrix result @xcite @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> our entropy estimate @xmath89 is also consistent with the mc estimate @xcite @xmath90 , but barely consistent with the more accurate transfer matrix result @xcite @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> still , a larger statistical sample and a careful study of systematic error sources would be needed to claim that there is a significant discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> our results could be improved by exploiting the high temperature expansion of the entropy , as it was done in @xcite . however </S>",
    "<S> , this would be against the spirit of this paper which is to explore the possibilities and limits of multicanonical spin glass simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> it is not entirely straightforward to compare multicanonical and standard simulations . </S>",
    "<S> for instance autocorrelation times of multicanonical simulations come out short due to the triviality that the simulation spends most of its time at rather small effective @xmath92 values . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , autocorrelations are not well suited . </S>",
    "<S> our ergodicity time , the average number of sweeps to find truly independent groundstates , is a more useful quantity . when relying on it , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e _ concentrating on groundstate properties , we should remember that this pushes the multicanonical simulation to its extreme . </S>",
    "<S> this way of calculating groundstate properties gives for free all properties in - between , from @xmath76 on . </S>",
    "<S> if a phase transition occurs , its study is also included ( we noticed no particular difficulties in the 2d ising model ) . </S>",
    "<S> for instance in the 3d ising spin glass the canonical slowing down at @xmath93 @xcite is already worse than the one given by our equation ( 8) .    although the slowing down ( 8) is severe , it seems to provide an important improvement when compared with the slowing down which canonical simulations encounter for temperatures below the bifurcation temperature . for @xmath94 canonical simulations @xcite are unable to equilibrate the systems at the @xmath78 values reported in our table since the relaxation time is by far too long . </S>",
    "<S> presumably due to this fact the literature focused on other questions and does not provide detailed fss investigation of relaxation times . at the present stage we did not want to spent cpu time on extensive canonical simulations </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , detailed comparisons are not possible . however , a rough estimate of the canonical ergodicity time may be @xcite @xmath95 the scaling with @xmath0 may then be hidden in the @xmath0 dependence of our @xmath78 values , which is argued to be divergent like @xmath96 , and this line of reasoning gives a slowing down of the canonical algorithm like @xmath97 . with @xmath98 ( our @xmath73 case ) </S>",
    "<S> one gets a canonical ergodicity time of order @xmath99 when the missing constant is assumed to be of order one , whereas our @xmath100 is about @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> already for moderately large @xmath45-values , a doubtful procedure has emerged in the literature @xcite : realizations which ( according to a well defined criterium ) can not be equilibrated are simply omitted . </S>",
    "<S> as these realizations are as legitimate members of the statistical ensemble as any other choice of the quenched random variables @xmath102 , an uncontrollable bias is inevitably introduced . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to this , we were able to equilibrate every single realization encountered .    </S>",
    "<S> when one is only interested in groundstate properties , minimization algorithms have to be considered . as a method simulated annealing @xcite stands out because of its generality , although there are more efficient algorithms for special cases , which should be used when appropriate . in simulated annealing </S>",
    "<S> the results depend on the cooling rate @xmath103 . for our model </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour @xmath104 with @xmath105 ( @xmath106 fixed ) is indicated @xcite . to find a true groundstate </S>",
    "<S> , one has to reduce @xmath107 $ ] to the order @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the constant @xmath109 is volume independent ( only the lattice size @xmath110 was considered in @xcite ) , this translates to # @xmath111 , far worse than our equation ( 8) . </S>",
    "<S> this result is kind of amazing as the multicanonical ensemble has eliminated directed cooling and is nevertheless more efficient . if one does not insist on true groundstates one </S>",
    "<S> can then relax the condition @xmath112 </S>",
    "<S> \\sim 1/v$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , any behaviour @xmath112 \\to 0 $ ] with @xmath113 would still give the correct density , and simulated annealing would slow down less dramatic . on the other hand , this would also imply a less stringent multicanonical simulation .    </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with the cluster - replica mc algorithm @xcite is even less clear cut . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained estimates of the groundstate energy and entropy are in accuracy similar to ours . </S>",
    "<S> as one has to simulate many replica at many @xmath45-values a direct comparison is impossible . clearly , the results reported on slowing down are more promising than ours for the ergodicity time . on the other hand , to our knowledge the replica mc approach has never been applied to the 3d edwards - anderson model , and one may well encounter difficulties . in contrast , 3d multicanonical simulations are straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the dimension is just a parameter in all our computer programs and we have already carried out various 3d test runs . </S>",
    "<S> let us address the question of algorithms from a more general perspective . with a metropolis type implementation </S>",
    "<S> our optimum performance will be bounded from below by a slowing down @xmath114 in cpu time , and we are outperformed by any algorithm which can do better than this . for a number of important , but often highly specialized , applications such better algorithms exist and should be used . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of the multicanonical ensemble is its generality . with this respect </S>",
    "<S> our method resembles simulated annealing @xcite , while clearly avoiding some of its disadvantages . </S>",
    "<S> most notably , the relationship to the equilibrium canonical ensemble remains exactly controlled . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it should be stressed that the multicanonical ensemble is an ensemble and not an algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> one may find better algorithms than conventional metropolis updating to simulate this new ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> to try a combination with cluster algorithms is an attractive idea .    </S>",
    "<S> our results make clear that the multicanonical approach is certainly a relevant enrichment of the options one has with respect to spin glass simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the similarities of spin glasses to other problems with conflicting constraints @xcite suggest that multicanonical simulations may be of value for a wide range of investigations : optimization problems like the travelling salesman , neural networks , protein folding , and others . </S>",
    "<S> multicanonical simulations of the 3d edwards - anderson model may eventually shed new light on the question whether the model exhibits mean field like behaviour or some kind of droplet picture applies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that previous numerical work remained somewhat inconclusive as sufficiently low temperatures could not be reached without destroying the thermodynamic equilibrium . </S>"
