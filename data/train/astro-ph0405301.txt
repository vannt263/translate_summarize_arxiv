    "the impact of stellar rotation upon fundamental stellar parameters was originally calculated by von zeipel @xcite .",
    "he showed that the stellar radius and the surface brightness are expressed as a function of the latitude ; the radius increases and the brightness decreases from the pole to the equator . the first attempt to determine the stellar oblateness owing to rapid rotation",
    "was performed with the intensity interferometer at narrabri @xcite . though they mentioned the possibility of a rotationally flattened shape for altair , their data was insufficient to decide the oblateness critically . in 2001 ,",
    "van belle et al ( 2001 ) observed altair using two baselines of the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti , colavita et al .",
    "they calculated the apparent stellar angular diameters from measured squared visibility amplitudes using the uniform - disk model and found that the angular diameters change with position angle .",
    "this was the first measurement of stellar oblateness owing to rapid rotation .",
    "they evaluated the effect of surface brightness distribution caused by gravity darkening on their angular diameter data . because their simulation showed that the diameters are changed only a few % , they neglected the gravity darkening effect . in 2003",
    ", a large oblateness of the be star achernar was measured with the vlti @xcite .",
    "they analyzed measured deformation with roche model which takes the surface brightness distribution owing to gravity darkening into account , but the deformation was too large to be explained within the range of the model .",
    "though both the measurement at pti and vlti demonstrated the determination of the stellar parameters such as orientation of the rotation axis and the apparent oblateness from the squared visibility amplitudes obtained with the interferometer , the effect of surface brightness distribution was not determined .",
    "because of the rapid rotation of altair , where apparent rotational velocities range from @xmath1 = 190km / s @xcite to 250km / s @xcite , this star is expected to be gravity darkened . however , the effects of the stellar surface brightness distribution on squared visibility amplitudes are small at low - resolution before the first minimum .",
    "for example , the effect of limb darkening on visibilities becomes more significant after the first minimum .",
    "consequently , in order to discuss the surface brightness distribution of rapidly rotating stars , it is indispensable to have high - resolution measurements at least over the first minimum . in 2001 , the npoi achieved an array configuration ( see next section ) which for the first time allowed for observations with a baseline as long as 64 m. with this long baseline and visible observing wavelength , the minimum fringe spacing becomes as small as 1.7 mas at the sky position of altair .",
    "this resolution is high enough to observe this @xmath03 mas star well over the first minimum .",
    "moreover , the npoi is equipped with a system which enables measurement of closure phase in addition to the squared visibility amplitudes since 1996 @xcite .",
    "closure phase is a sensitive measure to the asymmetry of the brightness distribution of a source .",
    "if the gravity darkened stellar disk is seen neither equator on nor pole on , the intensity distribution of the source projected on a baseline will be asymmetric and we expect that the measurement of the closure phase gives us useful information about inclination of the star .",
    "consequently , we expect that observations of altair with the npoi will provide better information than earlier observations in order to examine the surface brightness distribution of this rapidly rotating star .",
    "observations are done for four nights from 25 may to 1 june in 2001 using three baselines of 30 m , 37 m , and 64 m of npoi .",
    "we examine the apparent stellar diameters reduced using a uniform - disk model , and discuss the surface brightness distribution of this star .",

    "we chose vega as a comparison star because of its similar spectral type , magnitude , and angular size to that of altair .",
    "in addition , vega is a good comparison when we discuss the oblateness of altair because we expect negligible deformation from a circularly symmetric disk given that its observed rotational velocity is less than 20km / s @xcite . during our observations ,",
    "the measured squared visibility amplitudes of vega showed dependence on zenith angle when the star passed within 10 degrees of zenith .",
    "no such dependence was found outside this region .",
    "consequently , we removed data of vega with zenith angle smaller than 10 degree .",
    "fourteen scans of vega remained after this selection .",
    "we used all 19 scans of altair because that star does nt pass the region close to the zenith .",
    "we also used all data of @xmath2 aql and the number of scans of this star during four nights was 24 .",
    "@xmath2 aql was used to calibrate measured observables of both altair and vega .",
    "the uniform disk diameter of this calibration star is computed as 0.80mas from its observed color and magnitude @xcite .",
    "this value is also used in other observation @xcite .",
    "though the size of the star , 0.80mas , is small compared with vega and altair , the star is partly resolved with the longest baseline ; measured with the full 64.4 m baseline , squared visibility amplitudes become about 0.7 for a perfect interferometer . because @xmath2 aql is a rapidly rotating star with @xmath4km / s @xcite , we examined the possibility that using this star as a circular disk with the diameter of 0.80mas biases the results of vega and altair .",
    "we evaluated the effect of rotation as 5% changes in diameter and 5% asymmetric brightness distribution on the star owing to gravity darkening .",
    "at the longest baseline , we found that these features change the squared visibility amplitudes about 6% and phase about 3 degree at most .",
    "the calculated possible errors of squared visibility amplitudes and phase were almost the same level with the measurement errors , which are described in sec .",
    "consequently , the effect of the rapid rotation of the calibration star is not critical to our result , but we need to be careful when we reduce precise physical parameters directly from measured observables . because the signal to noise ratio of the measured visibilities decreases as the wavelength becomes shorter , we used only the 20 reddest of the 32 spectral channels , thus covering wavelengths from 520 nm to 850 nm .",
    "the raw squared visibility amplitudes of the calibration star depend on channels and baselines .",
    "the highest raw @xmath5 was @xmath6 at the reddest channel of ob2 ( @xmath5 for a perfect interferometer on a 0.8mas star is 0.96 ) and the lowest raw @xmath5 was 0.13@xmath70.01 at the bluest channel of ob3 ( @xmath5 for a perfect interferometer on a 0.8mas star is 0.6 ) .",
    "we also removed the data obtained at the spectral channel with wavelength , @xmath8 = 633 nm , because this channel contains light from the npoi s",
    "he - ne metrology laser .",
    "one detector for ob3 was not available during our observations and one other one did nt work on 1st june 2001 .",
    "consequently , the number of data were , 19 spectral channels @xmath9 19 scans=361 squared visibility amplitudes on ob1 and ob2 , 18 spectral channels @xmath9 15 scans + 17 spectral channels @xmath9 4 scans = 338 squared visibility amplitudes on ob3 , triple amplitudes , and closure phases . the total number of data were 361 @xmath9 2 + 338 @xmath9 3 = 1,738 .      before calibrating the measured observables",
    ", we corrected the effect of detector dead time .",
    "when we observe bright stars such as altair and vega , the effect of detector deadtime @xmath10 is not negligible .",
    "the deadtime of the detectors , which are used at the npoi , are approximately 200ns .",
    "the number of photons counted per unit cycle ( 500hz ) at the detectors of the red spectral channels become about 800 ; one photon is detected per approximately 2.5 @xmath11 sec . in such case ,",
    "the number of photons counted at the detectors becomes less than the number of incident photons , and the response of the detector becomes non - linear .",
    "this is a well known effect and we calculate the actual photon count rate , @xmath12 , using measured photon count rate , @xmath13 , as follows , @xmath14 here , count rate is the number of photons counted per one second .",
    "we calculated the actual visibility @xmath15 using the measured visibility @xmath16 as follows , @xmath17 this correction changed the squared visibility amplitudes of vega up to 20% . in this paper , we treat the detector deadtime correction as described above .",
    "triple amplitudes are also corrected based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : s2_va ] ) .",
    "the statistical errors of measured quantities are calculated and recorded for each scan . however , actual measurement errors are sometimes dominated by long - term errors rather than statistical errors within short - term measurement @xcite . generally , it is not easy to evaluate long - term systematic errors . in this paper , we calculated the variance of calibrated quantities , @xmath18 , of the calibration star as long - term errors and estimated errors of measured squared visibility amplitudes , @xmath19 , as follows , @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the time at the i - th scan , @xmath22 is the wavelength at the j - th spectral channel , @xmath23 is the statistical error , @xmath24 is the calibrated squared visibility amplitudes of the source , @xmath25 is the calibrated squared visibility amplitudes of the calibration star , and @xmath26 is the number of scans .",
    "we also estimated measurement errors of triple amplitudes as above . for closure phases",
    ", we used the following equation , @xmath27 the ratio of errors calculated using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : s2_svs ] ) , and ( [ eq : s2_scp ] ) to the statistical errors were 4.8 ( for squared visibility amplitudes at ob1 ) , 15.4 ( ob2 ) , 1.4 ( ob3 ) , 2.7 ( for triple amplitudes ) , 1.1 ( closure phases ) .",
    "this means that the measurement errors of these observations are nearly dominated by the long - term errors rather than short - term statistical errors .",
    "even if the measurement errors are dominated by long - term errors , it is confirmed that data obtained at npoi shows no systematic error compared with data obtained at other interferometer @xcite .",
    "the squared visibility amplitudes on three baselines , triple amplitudes , and closure phases on about 19 channels were obtained simultaneously for each scan in our observation . visibility measured at a baseline with projected baseline , @xmath28 , of a stellar interferometer , which is the fourier transform of the brightness distribution of the source ,",
    "is written as follows , @xmath29 { \\rm d } x } { \\int i(x ) { \\rm d } x},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the brightness distribution projected to the baseline , @xmath31 is the wavenumber .",
    "for example , visibility of the uniform - disk with the angular radius of @xmath32 is written as follows , @xmath33 visibility of the limb - darkened disk with the angular radius of @xmath34 and the linear limb darkening coefficient of @xmath35 is written as follows @xcite , @xmath36 the triple product is the product of the visibilities on three baselines that form a triangle , @xmath37 the triple amplitude is the absolute value of the triple product , @xmath38 as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : s3_v ] ) , if the brightness distribution of the source projected to a baseline , @xmath30 , is symmetric with @xmath39 , the imaginary part of the visibility is zero and the phase of the visibility takes 0 or @xmath40 degree . if the brightness distribution of the source is asymmetric , the imaginary part of the visibility becomes non - zero and the phase takes non - zero/@xmath40 degree .",
    "generally , it is not easy to measure phase of visibility with a ground interferometer because of atmospheric turbulence .",
    "however , the closure phase cancels the effect of atmospheric turbulence and conserves information of the source .",
    "consequently , closure phase is a useful interferometric observable in order to discuss asymmetry of brightness distribution of the source .",
    "vega was chosen as a comparison star due to its similarities in size , spectral type , and magnitude with altair , but yet without the high observed rotational velocity which would lead to apparent oblateness .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the squared visibility amplitudes and triple products measured during the night of 25 may 2001 for vega .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the observables of altair measured on the same night .",
    "the dashed lines show the uniform - disk model with the fitted angular diameters of @xmath41mas for altair , and @xmath42mas for vega .",
    "the solid lines show the limb - darkened disk model with the fitted angular diameters of @xmath43mas for altair and @xmath44mas for vega . in order to calculate the limb darkening model , we used linear limb darkening coefficients calculated by van hamme @xcite with parameters , @xmath45=7750k and log g=4.0 for altair , and @xmath45=9500k and log g=4.0 for vega .",
    "the measured observables of vega are better fitted with the limb - darkened model ( reduced @xmath46 ) , than with the uniform - disk model ( reduced @xmath4717.2 ) .",
    "the limb - darkened disk diameter of vega measured at pti was @xmath48mas @xcite and the diameters are consistent with about 2% error .",
    "however , altair was not well fitted with either the uniform - disk model ( reduced @xmath49 ) or the limb - darkened model ( reduced @xmath50 ) .",
    "altair s large inconsistency between the measured observables and models is mainly owing to the facts that : ( a ) the squared visibility amplitudes at ob3 and the triple amplitudes around the first minimum do not decrease to zero , and ( b ) the closure phases show non - zero/180 degree at all spectral channels .",
    "in addition , the measured squared visibility amplitudes at ob1 are slightly bigger than the circular uniform disk model while that at ob2 is slightly smaller than the model .",
    "the discrepancy of measured squared visibility amplitudes and triple amplitudes from the model around the first minimum indicates that there is a small bright component on the stellar disk , which is not resolved even with the longest baseline .",
    "non - zero/180 degree of closure phases means the brightness distribution of the source is asymmetric .      before considering the discrepancy from the uniform - disk model",
    ", we first examine whether the uniform disk angular diameter reduced from the squared visibility amplitudes changes with position angle and whether the change is consistent with the pti result .",
    "we consider the diameter change assuming the elliptical shape of the stellar disk .",
    "the brightness distribution of an uniform ellipse projected to a baseline with position angle @xmath51 becomes the same with that of the circular uniform - disk with angular radius , @xmath52 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the angular radius at the major axis , @xmath55 is the angular radius at the minor axis , and @xmath56 is the orientation angle of the ellipse on the sky , where @xmath57 corresponds to the minor axis pointing to the north on the sky . as a result , the squared visibility amplitude becomes the same as that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : s3_v2ud ] ) with the angular radius , @xmath52 . consequently , in order to determine the parameters of the ellipse , we reduce the data using the following procedure : first , calculate the angular diameters at a position angle by fitting the squared visibility of each scan at each baseline with eq .",
    "( [ eq : s3_v2ud ] ) , then compare the reduced diameters with eq .",
    "( [ eq : s3_rphi ] ) .",
    "notice @xmath52 is a little different from the intercept of an ellipse at an angle @xmath51 .    though the errors of fitted angular diameters are calculated from the errors of visibilities , we found that the scatters of the diameters were a few times larger than the calculated errors at ob1 and ob2 .",
    "thus we define the errors of the fitted angular diameters in another way . considering the small change of position angle at each baseline , @xmath58 ( ob1 ) , @xmath59 ( ob2 ) , @xmath60 ( ob3 ) ( tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] ) during the observation , we regard the change in angular diameter of the ellipse with position angle as small compared to the scatter of the fitted angular diameters .",
    "we therefore used the variance of the fitted angular diameters at each baseline , 0.09mas ( ob1 ) , 0.11mas ( ob2 ) , 0.02mas ( ob3 ) as errors of the fitted angular diameters .",
    "the error of the fitted angular diameters on ob3 is smaller compared with that of on ob1 and on ob2 .",
    "we consider this fact is owing to that the measured visibilities cover the first minimum at ob3 and the position of the first minimum improves the precision of the fitted diameters .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows fitted angular diameters with horizontal axis of position angle .",
    "the reduced @xmath61 of 1.5 calculated based on the scatter of the diameters of altair , with the circular uniform disk model is improved to 0.95 when we allow the diameter of altair to change with position angle .",

    "we found that altair is well explained by the ellipse rather than the circular disk while vega is well explained as the circular disk .",
    "the dependence of fitted diameters of altair on the position angle was similar to pti s .      in this section",

    "more sophisticated gravity and limb darkening modeling of a rapidly rotating star @xcite will also help the determination of physical parameters when we have sufficient multi baselines data .",
    "we expect these kinds of observations will be realized with current and future interferometers and that study on rapidly rotating stars will progress with further observation by interferometers .",

    "<S> an asymmetric surface brightness distribution of the rapidly rotating a7iv - v star , altair , has been measured by the navy prototype optical interferometer ( npoi ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observations were recorded simultaneously using a triangle of three long baselines of 30 m , 37 m , and 64 m , on 19 spectral channels , covering the wavelength range of 520 nm to 850 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the outstanding characteristics of these observations are ( a ) high resolution with the minimum fringe spacing of 1.7mas , easily resolving the 3-milliarcsecond ( mas ) stellar disk , and ( b ) the measurement of closure phase which is a sensitive indicator to the asymmetry of the brightness distribution of the source . </S>",
    "<S> uniform disk diameters fit to the measured squared visibility amplitudes confirms the altair s oblate shape due to its rapid rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the measured observables of altair showed two features which are inconsistent with both the uniform - disk and limb - darkened disk models , while the measured observable of the comparison star , vega , are consistent with the limb - darkened disk model . </S>",
    "<S> the first feature is that measured squared visibility amplitudes at the first minimum do not reach 0.0 but rather remain at @xmath00.02 , indicating the existence of a small bright region on the stellar disk . </S>",
    "<S> the other is that the measured closure phases show non - zero/180 degrees at all spectral channels , which requires an asymmetric surface brightness distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we fitted the measured observables to a model with a bright spot on a limb - darkened disk and found the observations are well reproduced by a bright spot , which has relative intensity of 4.7% , on a 3.38 mas limb - darkened stellar disk . </S>",
    "<S> rapid rotation of altair indicates that this bright region is a pole , which is brighter than other part of the star owing to gravity darkening . </S>"
