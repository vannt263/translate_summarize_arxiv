    "lattice qcd provides a first principles approach to nonperturbative calculations of qcd , indispensable in determining the hadron mass spectrum . in the early work of ref .",
    "@xcite , the ukqcd collaboration made use of gauge - invariant non - local operators to explore @xmath11 and @xmath12-wave mesons , as well as exotics .",

    "their calculation was performed at a single quark mass corresponding to approximately that of the strange quark and reported a @xmath0 exotic mass of @xmath14 gev .    in 1997 ,",
    "the milc collaboration used local operators formed by combining the gluon field strength tensor and standard quark bilinears @xcite , the same approach we take in this paper .",

    "requires access to quark masses near the chiral regime on large physical volumes .",
    "our study considers a physical volume of @xmath30 , and the @xmath31-improved flic fermion action @xcite whose improved chiral properties @xcite permit the use of very light quark masses which are key to our results .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figures [ onemp_prop ] and [ onemp_prop3 ] show the natural log of the correlation functions calculated with interpolators @xmath32 and @xmath33 from eq .",

    "figures  [ onemp ] and  [ onempthree ] show the effective mass for the two different interpolators . for clarity , we have plotted the results for every second quark mass used in our simulation .",
    "the plateaus demonstrate that we do indeed see an exotic signal in quenched lattice qcd .",
    "this is significant , as we expect the two interpolating fields to possess considerably different excited - state contributions , based on experience with pseudoscalar interpolators @xcite .",
    "for example , the approach to the pion mass plateau is from above ( below ) for the pseudo - scalar ( axial - vector ) interpolating field as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ standardpion ] ( fig .",
    "[ axialvectorpion ] ) .",
    "this exhibits the very different overlap of the interpolators with excited states . as in the @xmath0 interpolators ,",
    "the role of @xmath37 in the pion interpolators is to change the sign with which the large - large and small - small spinor components are combined .",

    "table  [ masstable ] summarizes our results for the mass of the @xmath0 meson , with the squared pion - mass provided as a measure of the input quark mass .",
    "the agreement observed in the results obtained from the two different @xmath0 hybrid interpolators provides evidence that a genuine ground - state signal for the exotic has been observed .",
    "table  [ masstable_strange ] summarizes our results for the mass of the strangeness @xmath38 , @xmath6 meson .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ survey ] we summarize a collection of results for the mass of @xmath0 obtained in lattice qcd simulations thus far .",
    "the current results presented herein are compared with results from the milc @xcite and sesam @xcite collaborations , both of which provide a consistent scale via @xmath22 .",
    "our results compare favorably with earlier work at large quark masses .",
    "agreement within one sigma is observed for all the quenched simulation results illustrated by filled symbols .",
    "it is interesting that the dynamical wilson fermion results of the sesam collaboration @xcite tend to sit somewhat higher as this is a well known effect in baryon spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "in comparing the results of quenched qcd simulations with experiment , the most common practice is to simply extrapolate the results linearly in @xmath39 or @xmath40 to the physical values .",
    "however , such an approach provides no opportunity to account for the incorrect chiral nonanalytic behavior of quenched qcd @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , little is known about the chiral nonanalytic behavior of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "@xcite provides a full qcd exploration of the chiral curvature to be expected from transitions to nearby virtual states and channels which are open at physical quark masses . while virtual channels act to push the lower - lying single - particle @xmath0 state down in mass , it is possible to have sufficient strength lying below the @xmath0 in the decay channels such that the @xmath0 mass is increased @xcite .",
    "depending on the parameters considered in ref .",
    "@xcite governing the couplings of the various channels , corrections due to chiral curvature are estimated at the order of @xmath41 to @xmath42 mev .    generally speaking ,",
    "chiral curvature is suppressed in the quenched approximation . for mesons ,",
    "most of the physically relevant diagrams involve a sea - quark loop and are therefore absent @xcite .",
    "however , the light quenched @xmath43 meson can provide new nonanalytic behavior , with the lowest order contributions coming as a negative - metric contribution through the double - hairpin diagrams .",
    "not only do these contributions alter the @xmath0 mass through self - energy contributions , but at sufficiently light quarks masses , open decay channels can dominate the two - point correlator and render its sign negative .    for the quenched @xmath0 meson , the @xmath3 channel can be open . using the pion mass as the @xmath43 mass a direct calculation of the mass of an @xmath3 two - particle state indicates that the @xmath0 hybrid lies lower than the two - particle state for heavy input quark mass .",
    "this indicates that the hybrid interpolator is effective at isolating a single - particle bound state as opposed to the two - particle state at heavy quark masses .",
    "this is particularly true for the case here , where long euclidean time evolution is difficult .    as the light quark mass regime is approached , the trend of the one and two - particle states illustrated in fig .",
    "[ extrapolation ] , suggests that they either merge or cross at our second lightest quark mass , such that the exotic @xmath0 may be a resonance at our lightest quark mass and at the physical quark masses .",
    "we note that the exotic @xmath0 mass displays the common resonance behavior of becoming bound at quark masses somewhat larger than the physical quark masses .",
    "this must happen at sufficiently heavy quark masses by quark counting rules , i.e @xmath44 for the @xmath0 to @xmath3 transition .",
    "one might have some concerns about @xmath3 contaminations in the two - point correlation function affecting the extraction of the @xmath0 meson mass @xcite .",
    "however we can already make some comments .    under the assumption that the coupling to the quenched @xmath3 channel comes with a negative metric , as suggested by chiral perturbation theory arguments , and from the observation that our correlation functions are positive",
    ", then it would appear that our interpolators couple weakly to the decay channel .",
    "furthermore , at heavy quark masses the correlation function is dominated by the @xmath0 bound state already at early euclidean times suggesting that coupling to the decay channel is weak .",
    "thus we conclude that the hybrid interpolating fields used to explore the @xmath0 quantum numbers are well - suited to isolating the single - particle @xmath0 exotic meson .",
    "moreover , since the mass of the @xmath3 channel is similar or greater than the single - particle @xmath0 state , one can conclude that the double - hairpin @xmath3 contribution to the self energy of the single - particle @xmath0 exotic meson is repulsive in quenched qcd . since the curvature observed in fig .",
    "[ survey ] reflects attractive interactions , we can also conclude that quenched chiral artifacts are unlikely to be large .",
    "the @xmath0 exotic meson mass obtained from fits of the effective mass of the hybrid interpolator @xmath32 from @xmath45 ( full triangles ) are compared with the @xmath46 two - particle state ( open triangles ) .",
    "the extrapolation curves include a quadratic fit to all eight quark masses ( dashed line ) and a linear fit through the four lightest quark masses ( solid line ) .",
    "the full square is result of linear extrapolation to the physical pion mass , while the open square ( offset for clarity ) indicates the @xmath47 experimental candidate . .",
    "]     extrapolation of the associated strangeness @xmath5",
    "@xmath48 state obtained from @xmath32 .",
    "symbols are as in fig .",
    "[ extrapolation ] . ]",
    "hence we proceed with simple linear and quadratic extrapolations in quark mass to the physical pion mass , with the caution that chiral nonanalytic behavior could provide corrections to our simple extrapolations the order of 50 mev in the @xmath0 mass@xcite .",
    "figures [ extrapolation ] and [ extrapolation_strange ] illustrate the extrapolation of the @xmath0 exotic and its associated strangeness @xmath49 @xmath50 state to the limit of physical quark mass .",
    "we perform the linear fit using the four lightest quark masses and fit the quadratic form to all 8 masses .",
    "a third - order single - elimination jackknife error analysis yields masses of @xmath51 and @xmath52 gev for the linear and quadratic fits , respectively .",
    "these results agree within one standard deviation with the experimental @xmath4 result of @xmath10 , and exclude the mass of the @xmath8 candidate .",
    "the associated parameters of the fits are as follows .",
    "the linear form @xmath53 yields best fit parameters of @xmath54 the quadratic fit , with formula @xmath55 returns parameters @xmath56",
    "we have found a compelling signal for the @xmath57 exotic meson , from which we can extrapolate a physical mass of @xmath51 gev .",
    "thus for the first time in lattice studies , we find a @xmath0 mass in agreement with the @xmath4 candidate .",
    "looking forward , it will be important to quantify the effects of the quenched approximation .",
    "we plan to revisit these calculations at some future point using full dynamical flic fermions @xcite .",
    "of particular interest will be the extent to which the curvature observed in approaching the chiral regime is preserved in full qcd .    additionally , we intend to explore the dependence of the exotic signal on the nature of the fermion source .",
    "whilst the rapidity with which we establish a plateau in our effective mass plots suggests that our current fermion operator smearing is near optimal for isolating the ground state , it might be possible to reduce the statistical errors through a careful selection of parameters coming out of a systematic exploration of the parameter space .",
    "we thank doug toussaint for sharing his collection of results for the @xmath0 .",
