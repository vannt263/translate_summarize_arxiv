    "there has been a recent resurgence of interest in supersymmetric ( susy ) gauge theories , due in part to the observation of dijkgraaf and vafa @xcite that certain classes of supersymmetric theories can be described by matrix models .",
    "this correspondence exists for pure @xmath0=2 susy u@xmath7 gauge theory broken to @xmath0=1 by a superpotential @xmath8 for adjoint chiral multiplet @xmath9 , as well as for other gauge groups @xcite , with the addition of matter @xcite , with multi - trace superpotentials @xcite and for deformations of @xmath0=4 gauge theories @xcite .",
    "the types of results that can be derived or verified from the matrix model dual include effective glueball superpotentials @xcite , seiberg duality @xcite , and the affleck - dine - seiberg superpotential at low energies @xcite .",
    "several techniques have been developed along these lines .",
    "the low energy superpotential after integrating out all of the matter can be derived in some cases , including nonperturbative effects , from just planar diagrams in the matrix model @xcite . a new type of duality emerged by relating weakly coupled theories upon varying the tree level couplings so the theory passes through strong coupling @xcite .",
    "similar results have been derived through consistency with the konishi anomaly @xcite , and these results are also expected to be consistent with the picture of monopole condensation as described by seiberg and witten @xcite .",
    "it is the last of these points of view that we consider in this paper .",
    "we will use the matrix model solutions to relate vacua of different gauge theories . in some sense",
    "this is a type of duality , although it follows naturally from an @xmath0=2 nonrenormalization theorem which is inherited by the @xmath0=1 theory obtained by deforming the @xmath0=2 theory .",
    "we will also study the matrix model solution for the @xmath10 theory in detail and demonstrate explicitly that the location in moduli space where monopole condensation takes place is consistent with the quantum modified constraint and factorization of seiberg - witten curves in _ all _ vacua of the theory , despite the complications due to the presence of baryons .",
    "there is a classic picture of confinement as arising from the dual meissner effect associated with the condensation of monopoles @xcite .",
    "just as superconductors confine magnetic fields when electrons condense , gauge theories are expected to confine electric fields when magnetic monopoles condense .",
    "while there is some evidence for this picture in ordinary qcd on the lattice @xcite , the occurrence of monopole condensation with confinement is better understood in certain supersymmetric theories @xcite .",
    "in particular , consider @xmath0=2 supersymmetric su@xmath1 yang - mills theory with @xmath2 fundamental massless flavors .",
    "the vacuum structure of these theories was studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "the moduli space of vacua is split into higgs branches , in which the matter scalars @xmath11 have vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , and the coulomb branch , in which the adjoint scalars @xmath12 , @xmath13 have vevs . at generic points in the moduli space @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "do not both have vevs together .",
    "the exception is along special submanifolds in the moduli space , called roots , where the higgs and coulomb branches meet .",
    "the roots are themselves classified by the gauge symmetry in the vacuum .",
    "there are non - baryonic roots in which the unbroken gauge symmetry is su@xmath14u@xmath15 with @xmath16 $ ] , and if @xmath17 there is also a baryonic root in which the gauge symmetry is su@xmath18u@xmath19 .",
    "( if @xmath2=@xmath20 then the unbroken gauge symmetry at the baryonic root is just u@xmath21 . ) at generic points on the coulomb branch the unbroken gauge symmetry is u@xmath21 , so the roots typically have an enhanced gauge symmetry if the quarks are massless .",
    "furthermore , the roots contain special points or submanifolds on which monopoles or dyons ( which we will refer to collectively as monopoles ) become massless .",
    "as we will review , upon breaking to @xmath0=1 supersymmetry the only vacua that survive are those points on the roots of the moduli space in which each of the unbroken u@xmath22 s has monopoles charged under it which then condense giving rise to confinement of electric charges as discussed above .",
    "these points typically occur at strong coupling , and the weak coupling degrees of freedom , @xmath23 with @xmath24 generators of su@xmath1 in the fundamental representation , are not a good description of the theory near these points . instead , there are weakly coupled dual degrees of freedom , @xmath25 , which are defined at each point in the moduli space up to gauge equivalences .",
    "the @xmath26-term equations of motion @xmath27=0 $ ] force the adjoint to belong to the cartan subalgebra of su@xmath1 so that the adjoint scalars @xmath28 can be diagonalized , and the @xmath29 independent diagonal elements form a basis of adjoints of the unbroken u(1)@xmath30 gauge group along the coulomb branch",
    ". we will concentrate on the theory with @xmath2=@xmath20 , and we will be most interested in those roots of the higgs branches at which monopoles @xmath31 condense . at the baryonic root @xmath29 of these monopoles",
    "are each charged under one of the unbroken u(1 ) s , and one of the monopoles , @xmath32 , has the opposite charge under each of the u(1 ) s .",
    "the monopoles form @xmath0=2 hypermultiplets , so for each @xmath0=1 chiral multiplet @xmath31 there is a charge conjugated chiral multiplet @xmath33 .",
    "it is convenient to collect the monopoles into a fundamental of the high energy su@xmath7 gauge group , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the monopoles acquire the @xmath0=2 superpotential , @xmath36 where the trace is over the su@xmath1 gauge group .",
    "differs from the usual @xmath0=2 normalization by a factor of @xmath37 , but was chosen for consistency with reference @xcite which we refer to often in this paper . ]",
    "the monopoles are massless when the vev of @xmath38 vanishes .",
    "the adjoint scalars @xmath39 ( or @xmath28 ) are not gauge invariant : @xmath39 lies in the cartan subalgebra of su@xmath1 , and there are elements of su@xmath1/u@xmath40 which leave @xmath39 in the cartan subalgebra but permute the diagonalized elements of @xmath39 .",
    "instead , it is convenient to parametrize the coulomb branch by gauge invariant polynomials @xcite , @xmath41 if @xmath0=2 supersymmetric mass terms of the form @xmath42 are added to the superpotential then generically the higgs branch will be completely lifted . from the point of view of the classical theory",
    "the reason is that the combination of @xmath26-term and adjoint @xmath43-term equations of motion force the squark vevs , written as @xmath44 matrices ( with @xmath3 here ) to take either the non - baryonic form @xcite : @xmath45 } &    &    &    \\\\      &       &            & 0 &    &    \\\\     &       &            &    & \\ddots   &    \\\\     &       &            &    &    & 0 \\end{array}\\right ) , \\hspace{1 cm } \\tilde{q}^t=\\left(\\begin{array}{cccccc }   0   &   &     & q_1 &       &    \\\\     & \\ddots   &     &    & \\ddots &    \\\\     &    &    0 &    &       & q_{[{n_f}/2]}\\\\      &    &     &    &       &    \\\\     &    &     &    &       &    \\\\     &    &     &    &       &    \\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] or the baryonic form , @xmath46    in components the matter @xmath43-term equations are : @xmath47 with @xmath9 diagonalized , it is clear that there are only nonbaryonic solutions with nonvanishing @xmath48 if pairs of masses are equal , and there are only baryonic solutions if @xmath49 ( for tracelessness of @xmath9 ) . while we only considered the case @xmath3 above",
    ", the general result remains true for @xmath50 : there are only non - baryonic higgs branches if pairs of quark masses are equal . as we will see in section  [ sec : m ] this behavior is immediately apparent from the type iia and m - theory brane constructions of these theories .",
    "if the @xmath0=2 theory is weakly broken to @xmath0=1 susy with a superpotential of the form @xmath51 then the effective superpotential including the light monopoles is @xmath52 . at the baryonic branch in the @xmath3 theory",
    "there are no additional massless fields besides the monopoles .    integrating out the @xmath53 leads to , @xmath54 which implies that , as long as @xmath55 is generic and nonvanishing , at least @xmath29 of the @xmath20 monopoles acquire vacuum expectation values .",
    "then the equations of motion for the monopoles set , @xmath56 so the @xmath0=1 vacua are stuck to the points at which the monopoles are massless , and they condense via ( [ eq : mon1 ] ) . in the massless @xmath0=2 theory these points are at the roots of the higgs branches , but for generic masses such points continue to exist despite the absence of higgs branches .",
    "however , the coulomb branch moduli at the @xmath0=1 vacua vary smoothly as the quark masses vary , so we will continue to label a vacuum of the @xmath0=1 theory as baryonic or nonbaryonic depending on which higgs branch the vacuum flows to as the quark masses are taken to zero .",
    "the low energy superpotential is then @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the solutions of ( [ eq : mon2 ] ) .",
    "if the quarks are massless , then at the non - baryonic roots the gauge symmetry is enhanced to su@xmath59u(1)@xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "in addition to the massless monopoles there are @xmath2 hypermultiplets in the fundamental of su@xmath62 .",
    "if pairs of quark masses are equal but otherwise generic , then non - baryonic branches remain unlifted , but the su@xmath62 factor is broken to u(1)@xmath63 and there is one hypermultiplet charged under each of these u(1 ) factors . in any case , these light fields also acquire the @xmath0=2 superpotential @xmath64 , and the @xmath65 equations of motion then set this term in the superpotential to zero as for the monopoles .",
    "the effective superpotential in the vacuum is then given by ( [ eq : weffmon ] ) , just as in the baryonic vacuum .    if the adjoint mass ( @xmath66 in the tree level superpotential ) is large compared to the dynamical scale @xmath67 , then the adjoint can be integrated out at high energies where the electric theory is weakly coupled .",
    "the description of the theory in terms of quarks is valid at that scale , and running down from there the mesons and baryons provide a valid low energy description of the theory .",
    "this description of the low energy theory should yield the same low energy superpotential as the monopole description ( [ eq : weffmon ] ) , assuming there is no phase transition as the adjoint mass is varied . including flavor masses , the tree level superpotential is , @xmath68 where the first sum is the usual @xmath0=2 superpotential and the second is the @xmath0=2 breaking superpotential . in the @xmath2=@xmath20 theory",
    "there is a quantum modified constraint among the mesons and baryons .",
    "we will check that the matrix model prediction of the low energy superpotential with only @xmath66 nonvanishing agrees with the field theory prediction from ( [ eq : wtree ] ) and the quantum modified constraint , and we will check in specific cases that these descriptions correctly predict the locations on the coulomb branch at which monopole condensation occurs .    in section [ sec : nf = nc ]",
    "we review the explicit matrix model results of demasure and janik @xcite and we demonstrate that the extension of these results to the case @xmath3 correctly reproduces the nonperturbative field theory predictions for the low energy superpotential at the appropriate vacua , with the expected quantum modified constraints on the moduli . in section [ sec : su2 ] we discuss the su(2 ) and su(3 ) theories in more detail , and demonstrate explicitly that the corresponding seiberg - witten curve factorizes as required for consistency with the picture of monopole condensation .",
    "in section  [ sec : bvsnb ] we use the matrix model solution to demonstrate a relation between vacua of theories with different numbers of colors and flavors .",
    "we elucidate some of these results via m5-brane constructions in section  [ sec : m ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we summarize the matrix model results of demasure & janik @xcite for su@xmath1 with @xmath50 and we discuss the extension of these results to the case @xmath3 .",
    "dijkgraaf and vafa @xcite suggested that @xmath0=2 supersymmetric gauge theories perturbed by single - trace superpotentials of the form @xmath70 have an equivalent description in terms of a large-@xmath71 matrix model whose action is simply @xmath72 for the @xmath73 matrix @xmath9 , @xmath74 vector @xmath65 and @xmath75 vector @xmath76 . another way to think of confinement below",
    "the scale of the flavor masses is via gaugino condensation in the @xmath0=1 pure yang - mills theory .",
    "again , the various descriptions of the theory ( in terms of quarks , monopoles or glueballs ) , are valid in different regimes of mass parameters or energies , and the assumption is that there is no phase transition upon varying these parameters so that the resulting low energy descriptions should be equivalent . in ( [ eq : matrixpot ] ) @xmath77 will be interpreted as the glueball superfield in the gauge theory . in particular , the leading @xmath71 contributions to the matrix model partition function are interpreted in terms of the effective glueball superpotential in the gauge theory .",
    "if the glueball superpotential is written , @xmath78 then the matrix model prediction for @xmath79 and @xmath80 is , @xmath81 the glueball is expected by symmetry arguments @xcite to couple to @xmath82 where @xmath67 is the dynamical scale of the theory . integrating in the glueball @xmath77 via a legendre transform of the low energy superpotential ( [ eq : weffmon ] ) with respect to @xmath82 @xcite , the effective glueball superpotential derived from the matrix model",
    "should be equated with @xcite , @xmath83 in ( [ eq : s2 ] ) the moduli are to be understood as functions of the quark masses and the scale @xmath84 , which is set to the dynamical scale @xmath67 by the @xmath77 equation of motion . by integrating out the @xmath84 auxiliary field , one obtains the low energy effective potential as a function of @xmath77 .",
    "one can easily check that integrating out the glueball @xmath77 reproduces the superpotential @xmath85 .    by explicitly calculating the matrix model integrals in ( [ eq : mm ] ) , determining the glueball superpotential ( [ eq : ws ] ) and comparing with ( [ eq : s2 ] ) , demasure and janik calculated the values of the moduli @xmath86 in the vacua of the theory as a function of the dynamical scale @xmath67 and the flavor masses @xmath87 .",
    "in fact , they were only interested in the baryonic vacua , so they selected a subset of the matrix model solutions .",
    "there is a @xmath88 ambiguity in the branch choice of a square root that appears in the identification of the effective superpotential in terms of matrix model variables .",
    "this can be seen either via the breakdown of the perturbative expansion of the matrix model free energies @xmath89 at the branch point , or via the existence of multiple saddle point solutions in the matrix model expressed in terms of mesons as opposed to quarks @xcite . by choosing the other branches we recover all of the vacua in the gauge theory . in the case",
    "that higgs branches are unlifted there is a simple relationship between the various branches of the square roots and the higgs branches . without repeating the details of the matrix model integrals ,",
    "we quote the results in the form given in @xcite .",
    "the result of the matrix model calculation for the moduli @xmath53 in the @xmath0=1 vacua is given implicitly in terms of the dynamical scale @xmath67 of the high energy theory , and @xmath90 , which is set to zero for the su@xmath1 theory .",

    "the @xmath104th higgs branch corresponds to all solutions with @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the number of @xmath107 s in the solution ( [ equ1])-([eq : upfact ] ) .",
    "the reflection of all @xmath108 s and @xmath107 s , i.e. taking @xmath109 , corresponds to solutions in the same @xmath104th higgs branch so we will generically take @xmath110 $ ] and call @xmath111 with the understanding that we must also consider solutions with @xmath112 in the same higgs branch .",
    "the choice @xmath113 corresponds to the baryonic branch , and the other roots correspond to the non - baryonic branches .",
    "recall also that we continue to label the vacua as baryonic or nonbaryonic despite the fact that for generic masses they are unrelated to higgs branches of the @xmath0=2 theory .",
    "for simplicity we will concentrate on tree level superpotentials containing only @xmath114 and @xmath115 , so from ( [ eq : up ] ) we will only need @xmath116 and @xmath117 , which are @xcite , @xmath118 this completes the summary of matrix model results we will need , and for the complete discussion we refer the reader to @xcite .      here",
    "we study the su@xmath1 theory with @xmath20 flavors .",
    "while the matrix model approach has additional complications when baryons are present @xcite , we will see that the baryons vanish in all vacua except when the sum of the quark masses vanishes . because the values of the moduli at the points where monopoles become massless vary smoothly with the quark masses , the effective superpotential is also a smooth function of the quark masses .",
    "hence , the matrix model predictions in previous sections for the low energy superpotential , which assumed that the baryons vanish , must correctly predict the effective superpotential on the baryonic higgs branches as well .",
    "this allows us to easily extend the results of @xcite to the case @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , it has been argued that the quantum modified constraint including the baryons @xmath119 follows from the matrix model with sources for the baryons included in the matrix model @xcite .",
    "we will check here that by assuming that the baryons vanish , the matrix model predictions for the moduli @xmath86 are consistent with a field theory analysis , and in section  [ sec : su2 ] we will demonstrate that these results correctly predict factorization conditions for related seiberg - witten curves .    as in the theories with @xmath50 studied in @xcite , @xmath120 will be related to the nonvanishing components of the diagonalized @xmath121 meson matrix , @xmath122 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath123 where the sign choice is the same as that which determines the choice of vacuum in ( [ equ1 ] ) and ( [ eqlambda ] ) , for example . we immediately recognize ( [ eqlambda ] ) as the quantum modified constraint of the @xmath0=1 theory with @xmath3 when the baryons vanish , @xmath124 where the one - loop matching condition determines the low energy dynamical scale below the mass @xmath125 as @xmath126 .",
    "we would like to demonstrate that the low energy effective superpotential at the various vacua agree with the matrix model prediction .",
    "recall that the gauge theory at low energies has dual descriptions , either in terms of mesons and baryons or in terms of monopoles .",
    "we discussed the description in terms of monopoles in the introduction .",
    "if the only @xmath0=2 breaking term in the action is an adjoint mass , then the effective superpotential in the vacuum of the theory with @xmath127 is , @xmath128 where @xmath129 is evaluated at a solution of ( [ eq : mon2 ] ) .",
    "we obtain the description in terms of mesons and baryons by taking the @xmath0=2 superpotential deformed by the superpotential ( [ eq : w1 ] ) , integrating out the adjoint and the massive matter , and adding the expected quantum modified constraint by hand .",
    "this is expected to be valid when the adjoint mass @xmath125 is much larger than the dynamical scale @xmath67 ( so that the theory is weakly coupled at @xmath125 ) , and then also for smaller values assuming there is no phase transition as the adjoint mass is varied .",
    "the full tree level superpotential is , @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a lagrange multiplier enforcing the tracelessness of @xmath9 in the su@xmath1 theory .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath9 are , @xmath132 the trace of which determines @xmath131 : @xmath133 then we integrate out @xmath9 using ( [ eq : phieom ] ) to obtain , @xmath134 where the traces are now over flavor indices , and we have defined , @xmath135 the quantum modified constraint can be added to ( [ eq : weffft ] ) via a lagrange multiplier , @xmath136 .",
    "the vacua are determined by the equations of motion that follow from ( [ eq : weffft ] ) together with the quantum modified constraint , which are solved by a diagonal meson matrix , @xmath122 . in order to compare the results with the seiberg - witten description of the theory it is convenient to define @xmath137 .",
    "then ( [ eq : weffft ] ) becomes , @xmath138 and the equations of motion are , @xmath139    note that we have implicitly assumed that the baryons vanish in the analysis above .",
    "including the possibility for baryonic vevs , the lagrange multiplier term in ( [ eq : wefftilde ] ) is modified to @xmath140 , where with the inclusion of the lagrange multiplier we are to treat @xmath141 and @xmath142 as independent of the mesons @xmath143",
    ". then the @xmath141 and @xmath142 equations of motion are : @xmath144 hence , the baryons can only be nonvanishing if the lagrange multiplier @xmath145 vanishes .",
    "so let us assume that @xmath146 . then , summing the equations of motion ( [ eq : eomtilde ] ) over the @xmath20 flavors we easily see that a solution exists only if @xmath49 . as explained earlier",
    ", the fact that such solutions occur only for isolated regions in the parameter space of the theory , in addition to the fact that the low energy superpotential varies smoothly with these parameters , implies that the low energy superpotential is independent of the baryon vevs in the baryonic vacua .",
    "we will see an example of this in section  [ sec : su2 ] .",
    "we will now demonstrate that the alternative description for the low energy superpotential as @xmath147 , with the matrix model prediction for @xmath114 in the vacuum , agrees with ( [ eq : wefftilde ] ) and ( [ eq : eomtilde ] ) . from ( [ eq : upfact ] ) and ( [ eq : up ] ) , we have , @xmath148 \\\\",

    "we have extended previous predictions for the vacuum structure of broken @xmath0=2 gauge theories with matter to the case of su@xmath1 gauge group with equal number of flavors and colors . below the scale of the massive adjoint hypermultiplet this theory acquires a quantum modified constraint on the moduli due to nonperturbative effects . with this constraint",
    "we determined the field theory expectation for the low energy superpotential below the lowest mass scale of the theory .",
    "we found a number of solutions corresponding to the various vacua of the theory .",
    "these results were compared with the matrix model prediction for the low energy superpotential and were found to agree .",
    "although the presence of baryons in the theory could potentially have been a problem for the naive generalization of the matrix model results for @xmath50 to this case , we argued that the low energy superpotential is independent of the baryon vevs .",
    "we studied the su(2 ) and su(3 ) theories in detail and verified the matrix model prediction for the location on the coulomb branch at which the seiberg - witten curve maximally factorizes , with @xmath341 pairs of double roots .",
    "it would be interesting to extend these results to theories in which the baryons play a nontrivial role , for example by adding a tree level superpotential depending on them .",
    "we also demonstrated a relation between the nonbaryonic vacua of the su@xmath1 theory with @xmath2 flavors and specially tuned masses and the vacua of the su@xmath265 theory with @xmath266 flavors . to be precise",
    ", we checked that one of the moduli @xmath342 matches between these vacua , and by the @xmath0=2 nonrenormalization theorem we expect the same to be true for the other moduli .",
    "it would be nice to check this claim explicitly via the matrix model solutions .",
