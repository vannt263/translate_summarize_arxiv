    "the @xmath2li nucleus is a prominent example of the so - called borromean nuclei which can be described as a three  body system ( @xmath3li plus two neutrons ) where none of the internal two  body subsystems is bound @xcite .",
    "few - body models and techniques have been very successful @xcite but they must necessarily rely heavily on the underlying two - body interactions .",
    "phenomenological interaction parameters for the neutron-@xmath3li system have usually been obtained by constraints of the properties of @xmath2li . however , comparison between measurements and these theories suffered from the fact that essentially all theoretical investigations assumed spin zero for both @xmath3li and @xmath2li .",
    "this is very unsatisfactory and also rather surprising especially considering the huge amounts of work invested in @xmath2li .",
    "substantially more complicated models are required but the available techniques are also very developed .",
    "the new experimental results have prompted us to reinvestigate the present @xmath1li-@xmath2li connection .",
    "the experimental data about the properties of @xmath1li , and therefore also of @xmath2li , still remain incomplete .",
    "the quantum numbers of the @xmath1li ground state are not firmly established . the first attempt to measure the @xmath1li spectrum was made by wilcox et al .",
    "@xcite placing the ground state of the unbound nucleus @xmath1li at 0.80@xmath80.25 mev .",
    "more recent experiments @xcite concluded the existence of a very low - lying state in @xmath1li , although its quantum numbers were not determined . in @xcite",
    "the authors identified the 1@xmath9state as the most probable @xmath1li ground state .",
    "this parity inversion was already discussed much earlier for neighboring nuclei in @xcite and for @xmath1li in @xcite .    a probable @xmath5state as ground state of @xmath1li was experimentally suggested in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a @xmath7resonance was observed at an energy of 538@xmath862 kev , together with a weak evidence of a barely unbound @xmath5 or @xmath7resonance in @xmath1li .",
    "a bit later , abramovich et al .",
    "@xcite and zinser et al .",
    "@xcite claimed that the ground state of @xmath1li corresponds to a very low lying @xmath10=0 state . in the first case",
    "the energies of the doublet 2@xmath11/1@xmath11 were given to be 27 kev and 88 kev , respectively , while in @xcite the energy of the low - lying @xmath5state was established to be below 50 kev .",
    "recent experiments have been performed in order to clarify this puzzle . in @xcite the existence of a @xmath7resonance ,",
    "probably the 2@xmath9 state , at 0.54@xmath80.06 mev has been confirmed , and the existence of a lower @xmath7resonance , the 1@xmath9 state , has been found at 0.24@xmath80.06 mev . although the existence of a low  lying @xmath5state is not confirmed in this work , they emphasize that part of the observed strength at the threshold might represent @xmath10=0 strength .    more recently , thoennessen et al .",
    "@xcite have repeated the experiment of kryger et al .",
    "@xcite with improved energy resolution in order to establish more stringent limits of the @xmath5wave parameters .",
    "they concluded that a low  lying @xmath5state was observed with a scattering length of at least 20 fm corresponding to a peak energy of less than 50 kev .",
    "they also found indications of a @xmath7state around 540 kev , and they did not rule out another @xmath7-state at @xmath12240  kev .    in @xcite the experimental spectrum was fitted with a @xmath7state at @xmath13  kev and width @xmath14  kev .",
    "substitution of this resonance by combination of one @xmath5 and one @xmath7 or combination of two @xmath7 s provided fits which were less significant due to the increase of fit parameters .",
    "inclusion of the extra @xmath5wave or @xmath7wave moved the 500 kev state up by 15 and 25 kev , respectively .",
    "no other states were identified , either because they were not populated , or because the experimental resolution was insufficient .",
    "although there is no evidence for a state at @xmath12250  kev there is a small enhancement , also seen in @xcite .",
    "finally the last experiment by chartier et al .",
    "@xcite produced @xmath1li by proton knockout of @xmath2be .",
    "the measured resulting @xmath3li nucleus in the ground state is predominantly produced from @xmath5-wave neutron emission of @xmath1li which is concluded to resemble the neutron configuration in the @xmath2be ground state .",
    "thus the ground state of the n-@xmath3li system is an @xmath5-wave below 50  kev .    as a consequence of all this",
    "it is well established experimentally that the ground state of @xmath1li corresponds to a very low  lying @xmath5state .",
    "furthermore a @xmath7resonance at an energy of around 0.5 mev is present in the @xmath1li spectrum .",
    "the other quantum numbers specifying the couplings of these states remain so far unknown .",
    "also the presence of a second @xmath7resonance at around 0.25 mev is not well established and another @xmath5-state , which necessarily also must be present in the low energy spectrum , is entirely unknown .",
    "the observed resonances or virtual states in the neutron-@xmath3li spectrum are related to the second @xmath15 and the first @xmath16-states .",
    "the first @xmath15 and the lowest @xmath17-states are occupied in the @xmath3li - nucleus .",
    "the lowest @xmath15-state is strongly bound and the energy of the @xmath17-state can be estimated as the one - neutron separation energy of @xmath3li , i.e. 4.1  mev @xcite . strictly speaking",
    "this energy applies to @xmath3li whereas both the @xmath17 and @xmath16-states discussed in the present context are related to the @xmath1li - system .    from the theoretical side , initial calculations @xcite considered the ground state of @xmath1li to be the 1@xmath9 state at an energy of 810 kev , as given in @xcite .",
    "however in @xcite is already mentioned the possibility that the ground state of @xmath1li is 2@xmath11 , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the first three - body computation of the @xmath2li properties @xcite predicted that , to be consistent with the available data , @xmath1li should have an @xmath5-state below 300 kev in conflict with the 800 kev at that time believed to be the ground state resonance energy .    in @xcite",
    "it was confirmed that core momentum distributions after fragmentation of @xmath2li were consistent with a low lying @xmath5state in @xmath1li , and it was estimated that @xmath2li has nearly 50% of @xmath5wave motion between one neutron and the core .",
    "this fact of a negative parity state was contradicted by subsequent microscopic calculations @xcite that predicted a 1@xmath9 assignment for the ground state of @xmath1li . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "an @xmath5state was predicted to be the ground state of @xmath1li .      in @xcite a method to solve faddeev equations in coordinate space is developed in detail .",
    "this method is especially suitable to describe the large distance behavior of weakly bound three  body systems .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that combination of this method to describe @xmath2li and the simple sudden approximation as fragmentation reaction model are sufficient to reproduce the shape of the experimental neutron and core momentum distributions after fast fragmentation of @xmath2li on a light target .",
    "we have shown that the agreement with the experiment is obtained only when the final interaction between fragments is included , and also when a low  lying @xmath5state is present in @xmath1li .",
    "inclusion of only @xmath7states in the @xmath1li spectrum necessarily leads to too broad neutron momentum distributions .",
    "in @xcite we have investigated the angular correlations after breakup of @xmath18he and @xmath2li , and we have shown that the presence of a low lying @xmath5state gives rise to a very different angular distribution compared to nuclei as @xmath18he where the @xmath7resonances dominate in the neutron ",
    "core system .",
    "the experimental data for the angular distribution arising from @xmath2li was later published @xcite and found to be in agreement with the distribution predicted in @xcite .",
    "this is imperative evidence of strong @xmath5wave configurations in both @xmath1li and @xmath2li .",
    "more detailed calculations of momentum distributions after fragmentation of @xmath2li on light targets are reported in @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the experiments is found to be rather good when around 40% of @xmath7wave is present in the relative neutron@xmath0li motion .",
    "nevertheless the precise energies and quantum numbers of the @xmath1li states are not well established , since the momentum distributions are mainly sensitive to the average energies of the doublets 1@xmath11/2@xmath11 and @xmath19/2@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath1li these states arise from couplings of the @xmath3li - spin of 3/2 to the available @xmath15 and @xmath16 neutron states . in @xmath2li",
    "the pauli principle prevents the neutrons from both choosing the lowest state .",
    "parity then requires an equal distribution within each doublet .",
    "thus , most observables are not sensitive to the precise positions of these doublets , only to their average values .",
    "this is the reason why so many theoretical computations agree fairly well with experiments even with the obviously wrong assumptions of spin zero for both @xmath3li and @xmath2li .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum is an exception which could be sensitive to the precise position of the resonances and virtual states .",
    "very recently the fragmentation model used in @xcite has been implemented to take into account the interaction between each of the halo constituents and the target , as well as to include coulomb interaction , making the method valid not only for light targets , but also for intermediate and heavy targets .",
    "this is the participant  spectator method described in details in @xcite .",
    "the method works well for @xmath18he , where essentially no uncertainties in the neutron ",
    "core interaction are present .",
    "this success for the case of @xmath18he leads us to turn the problem around and investigate in details which structure of @xmath1li is consistent with the firmly established properties of both @xmath3li , @xmath1li and @xmath2li .",
    "first the neutron-@xmath3li potential must be consistent with the structure of @xmath3li and the energies and quantum numbers of the established two - body resonances and virtual states must be reproduced",
    ". then also the known @xmath2li three - body structure must be reproduced .",
    "the unavoidable facts are one and only one particle bound state with angular momentum and parity @xmath20 , with binding of 295@xmath835 kev @xcite , with large interaction cross sections on all targets and with narrow fragment momentum distributions after breakup .",
    "the complicated model with finite core spin is then inescapable .",
    "the measured differential or total @xmath2li reaction cross sections are interpreted as evidence for an exceptionally large spatial extension of the neutron matter and a correlated wave function mixing roughly equally relative neutron - core @xmath5 and @xmath7-states .",
    "the quantitative details must necessarily be extracted by use of model computations .",
    "apart from the binding energy of about 0.30  mev the crucial parameter is the @xmath7-wave content determined to be about 40% in a rather successful model @xcite , which is able to describe essentially all measured breakup cross sections .",
    "the breakup cross sections are first of all sensitive to this @xmath5-wave content and we shall therefore aim at reproducing these 60% in the @xmath2li structure .",
    "the model dependence of the extracted results has to be minimized as far as possible .",
    "this important issue can be illustrated by two different examples .",
    "the first is the interpretation of the neutron momentum distribution observed in breakup reactions .",
    "narrower distributions result from inclusion of both final state interactions and from removal of those parts of the three - body wave function where only one or two of the three halo particles appear after the reaction , i.e. true three - body breakup @xcite",
    ". a larger fraction of neutron - core @xmath5-wave would compensate and delusively reproduce the measurement .",
    "the second example is the interaction cross section often attempted to be expressed in terms of a corresponding value of the @xmath2li root mean square radius .",
    "this interpretation is also model dependent as evidenced by the different results , i.e. radii of 3.1@xmath80.3 fm @xcite , 3.53@xmath80.10 fm @xcite and 3.62@xmath80.19 fm @xcite from glauber models with parametrized densities , three - body densities and from elastic proton scattering with gaussian densities , respectively .",
    "the first of these , off hand least sophisticated , analyses @xcite used parametrized static densities of various kinds . the second analysis used a reaction model accounting for the few - body correlations obviously present in the initial wave function @xcite",
    "the essential input is then the three - body ground state wave function and the resulting radius relies heavily on the properties of this choice .",
    "the result of about 3.53  fm quoted above arises from two - body interactions where the virtual states and resonances can not all agree with the established experimental information .",
    "there average positions are unrealistically low and there is no spin splitting in the calculation .",
    "the @xmath7-wave content is almost 60% and the presently accepted use of a three - body interaction for fine tuning is not applied .",
    "the third analysis is from elastic proton scattering resulting in an even larger radius @xcite .",
    "again this is one numerical value and corresponding results for @xmath21he are in conflict with other information .",
    "avoiding the model dependence entirely is not possible . minimizing the uncertainties",
    "at least require that all effects influencing the observables in question must be accounted for in the model .",
    "the safest is to use one consistent model with all anticipated physical effects included and with one set of parameters reproducing all measured data from the two - body input data to the differential breakup cross sections .",
    "we rely on the three - body structure model @xcite and the reaction models developed for systems precisely like @xmath2li @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we briefly sketch the method used to construct the three  body wave function and the model to compute the breakup cross sections .",
    "we continue in section [ sec3 ] with the details of the interactions involved in the particular case of @xmath2li . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we show results for the @xmath2li wave function and for different relevant observables after fragmentation reactions .",
    "finally section [ sec5 ] contains the summary and the conclusions .",
    "the wave function of the three  body halo system is obtained by solving the faddeev equations in coordinate space @xcite .",
    "this is done by writing each of the three faddeev equations in terms of each of the three sets of hyperspherical coordinates @xmath22 , @xmath23 , where the index @xmath24 is related to a given jacobi system .",
    "the three ",
    "body wave function @xmath25 is then a sum of the three faddeev components , each of them expanded for a given @xmath26 in terms of a complete sets of generalized angular functions @xmath27",
    "@xmath28    the angular wave functions are solutions of the angular part of the faddeev equations    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath31 , @xmath32 is a normalization mass , @xmath33 is the two - body interaction between particles @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the @xmath26-independent part of the kinetic energy operator .",
    "the expression for @xmath37 is given in @xcite .",
    "the radial functions @xmath38 are the solutions of the coupled set of `` radial '' differential equations @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an anticipated three - body potential and the eigenvalues of the angular part , @xmath41 , enter as effective potentials .",
    "the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 are defined as the angular integrals @xmath44    the observables obtained after fragmentation of @xmath2li are computed by using the participant  spectator method @xcite .",
    "the breakup cross sections are obtained by adding the incoherent contributions from processes where one , two , or three halo particles simultaneously interact with the target .",
    "the interaction with the target of one of them ( participant ) is described by a phenomenological optical potential and the black disk model is used for the other two particles ( spectators ) .",
    "let us assume that the halo constituent @xmath24 is the participant and the final state can be described as two independent two  body systems , one made by particle @xmath24 and the target @xmath45 , and the second made by the remaining halo constituents @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this final state description is appropriate for large momentum transfer processes in which the constituent @xmath24 is violently removed from the projectile . under these assumptions , and working in the frame of the halo projectile",
    ", the differential cross sections can be written as @xcite    @xmath46    @xmath47    where eq.([elas ] ) and ( [ abs ] ) refer to the cases in which @xmath24 is elastically scattered and absorbed by the target , respectively .",
    "the cross sections @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the differential elastic and absorption cross sections for the participant  target scattering .",
    "the momenta @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are the relative momenta in the final state between the center of mass of the two final two  body systems , between the halo constituents @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and between @xmath24 and the target , respectively . the momentum @xmath53 is the momentum transfer in the process .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath54 are the total spin and its third component of the halo nucleus , @xmath55 are the spin and third component of the two  body final state made by particles @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and @xmath56 is the final state third component of the spin of particle @xmath24 . the target is assumed to have spin zero .",
    "the expressions are then correct when the participant @xmath24 has spin 0 or 1/2 , but we shall employ them even for the spin of 3/2 corresponding to the @xmath3li - core . we expect this is a very accurate approximation .",
    "the function @xmath57 in eq.([elas ] ) is included to remove the non  zero component of the three  body bound state plus target in the final state , that represents elastic scattering of the halo nucleus as a whole . finally , @xmath58 is the overlap between the @xmath59wave function in the final state and the wave function of the three  body projectile .    in @xcite",
    "all the details about the participant  spectator model are given , as well as the optical potentials used to describe the interaction between participant @xmath24 and the target .",
    "to obtain the @xmath2li wave function by use of the procedure sketched above one needs to specify the two  body interactions entering in eq.([eq1 ] ) , i.e. the neutron  neutron and the neutron-@xmath0li interactions .",
    "the neutron - neutron interaction is specified in @xcite .",
    "the neutron@xmath3li interaction is obviously decisive in order to establish the @xmath1li spectrum .",
    "we therefore must be very careful in the choices of both form and parameters .",
    "results from previous work can not be used directly since we want , and perhaps even need , a better correspondence between core - density and potentials of both core and valence neutrons .",
    "we begin with the core density and potential of the core neutrons .",
    "the @xmath0li - core consists of two neutrons and two protons in the @xmath15shell and four neutrons and one proton in the @xmath17shell . the mean square radius of @xmath0li is then given by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the mean square radii of the @xmath15 and @xmath17orbits , respectively .",
    "if we use gaussian potentials for @xmath5 and @xmath7waves with equal range , @xmath63 , we can estimate the range of the interaction by using that i ) the root mean square radius of @xmath0li is 2.32 fm , ii ) the lowest @xmath5state must be bound and the second must correspond to a low lying neutron virtual state in @xmath1li , and iii ) the @xmath7potential must have a bound state with a neutron separation energy around 4.1 mev @xcite .",
    "the precise position of the @xmath17-state is not important in the present work and we shall use the value 4.1  mev obtained for @xmath3li even though the potential applies to the neutron-@xmath3li system .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath17 bound states in this potential then produce a @xmath0li density distribution which strictly speaking is that of the core particles in @xmath1li .",
    "this is lack of selfconsistency in line with an inert core approximation , but only applied to estimate the range of the potential .",
    "this is only of marginal importance provided the resonances and virtual states remain unchanged .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we show these potentials fulfilling conditions ii ) and iii ) for three different ranges of the gaussian . in all the three cases",
    "the @xmath5potentials have only a bound state and a virtual state around 300 kev , and the @xmath7potential has only a bound state at @xmath64 mev .",
    "as we can see in the table , only a range of around 2.0 fm is giving rise to a root mean square radius for @xmath0li in agreement with the experimental value of 2.32 fm .",
    ".parameters of the trial potentials @xmath65 used for the occupied @xmath15 and @xmath17levels in @xmath0li .",

    "[ fig6 ] the lowest @xmath16resonance is very close to threshold ( the crossing between @xmath69 kev and @xmath7wave content of 40% in fig .",

    "as previously indicated there is no experimental evidence of such a low @xmath16resonance , and it is established that the ground state corresponds to an @xmath15state .    finally , in the lower part of fig .  [ fig6 ]",
    "we show the @xmath1li spectrum by assuming @xmath70 kev . again , since the three ",

    "also a @xmath16resonance ( the 2@xmath9state ) appears at an energy below 100 kev .    from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the same procedure gives negative energies of the 1@xmath9level , meaning that this level is bound .",
    "this is of course against the well known fact that @xmath1li is not bound , and the corresponding @xmath1li spectrum can certainly not correspond to the real one . actually , from the spectra ( c ) and ( d ) in the middle part of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we already see that a value of @xmath71 slightly below 200 kev is already binding the @xmath19level .    for completeness",
    "we give in table  [ tab3 ] the two and three  body potentials corresponding to all the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .      according to the experimental and theoretical information collected about @xmath1li and @xmath2li",
    "we can conclude that the spectra shown in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , especially in ( c ) and ( d ) , and spectra ( a ) and ( b ) shown in the middle part , are the main candidates for the @xmath1li  spectrum . from the different observables obtained experimentally after fragmentation of @xmath2li the invariant mass spectrum is the observable most sensitive to the energies of the different resonances and virtual states .",
    "investigation of the invariant mass spectrum could then help to establish which spectrum is most probable for @xmath1li .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the invariant mass spectrum for all the @xmath1li spectra shown in fig .  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the observables after fragmentation of @xmath2li are computed following the participant  spectator method described in @xcite .",
    "the external parts of each graph in the figure show the computed invariant mass spectrum ( thin lines ) and the result after convoluting with the experimental beam profile ( thick lines ) .",
    "this curve is compared with the experimental data taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these sets of experimental data do not agree in the absolute numbers , and we have scaled those of @xcite to the same maximum as in @xcite .",
    "note that the only difference between the @xmath1li  spectra ( a ) and ( b ) and between ( c ) and",
    "( d ) is the ordering of the @xmath72 and the @xmath73levels . therefore the compared solid lines and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] differ only in the ordering of the 1@xmath11/2@xmath11doublet .",
    "for the solid lines the @xmath72state is at 50 kev , while for the dashed lines the 2@xmath11state is at 50 kev .    as we can see in all the panels in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the difference between solid and dashed lines is very small , especially after convoluting with the experimental beam profile .",
    "the only difference appears before convoluting and at very small energies , where the cases with the 2@xmath11state at 50 kev ( dashed lines ) have a higher peak .",
    "this is due to the larger statistical weight of the @xmath73level compared to the 1@xmath11level ( 5/3 times bigger ) . in any case , from the invariant mass distributions and its comparison with the present experimental data it is not possible to determine which of the two states in the doublet @xmath72/@xmath73 corresponds to the low ",
    "lying @xmath5state found experimentally .",
    "let us concentrate now on the @xmath1li  spectra ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "in the three cases , upper , middle , and lower parts , one of the @xmath5states is placed at 50 kev , and the @xmath19resonance is fixed at 0.54 mev .",
    "basically the only difference between the three cases is the energy of the 2@xmath9level , that goes from almost 0.4 mev to a small value below 100 kev .",
    "looking at the corresponding invariant mass distributions in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we observe that calculations before convoluting with the experimental beam profile show two peaks corresponding to the low @xmath5state at 50 kev , and the @xmath74resonance .",
    "these two peaks approach each other when the energy of these two levels becomes closer , and the one corresponding to the @xmath74resonance becomes higher when its energy approaches the threshold .",
    "in fact , in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] both peaks can not be distinguished .",
    "the peak corresponding to the @xmath19state at 0.54 mev can not be seen .",
    "looking at the @xmath7wave contribution ( inner panels ) we note that only in the lower part this peak can be noticed in the small bump produced in the total invariant mass distribution , although this bump disappears after convolution with the beam profile .",
    "the main effect produced by the different energies of the @xmath74resonance is that the lower the energy of the state the narrower the computed invariant mass spectrum .",
    "this fact is preserved after convoluting the computed distributions with the experimental beam profile .",
    "the main effect of the convolution is that the separated peaks associated to the low  lying @xmath5state and the @xmath74resonance merge into one . in any case",
    "the comparison with the experimental distribution shows that the computed ones are too narrow , except perhaps for values of the @xmath74level close or higher than 0.4 mev .",
    "this would mean that the two states in the @xmath19/@xmath74doublet would be almost degenerate .",
    "therefore a @xmath74level below the @xmath19level is not likely .",
    "let us focus now on the @xmath1li  spectra ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "again one of the @xmath5levels is placed at 50 kev , but now the @xmath74level is fixed at 0.54 mev , while the energy of the @xmath19level takes different values . in the upper part",
    "the 1@xmath9resonance has an energy of 0.25 mev .",
    "the computed invariant mass spectrum shows two shoulders produced by the two @xmath7resonances .",
    "these two states are clearly seen in the @xmath7wave contribution shown in the inset of the upper part of fig .",
    "nevertheless the structure observed in the computed invariant mass spectrum disappears after convolution .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data is quite satisfactory , especially with the one given in @xcite . if we reduce the energy of the @xmath19level its contribution appears in a higher and narrower peak .    in the middle part of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the extreme case in which the @xmath19level is very close to the threshold ( its energy is around 10 kev ) .",
    "as we see in the inset , the @xmath7wave contribution has a wide peak at 0.5 mev and a sharp and very high peak at a very low energy corresponding to the 1@xmath9resonance .",
    "this is obviously producing a similar high and narrow peak in the computed invariant mass spectrum .",
    "nevertheless after convolution this peak is not visible anymore , and the comparison with the experiment can also be considered rather good .",
    "this is because although convolution is diluting the presence of the sharp peak at low energies there is still a resonance at 0.54 mev , with high statistical weight , that makes the tail of the total distribution behave accordingly .",
    "therefore a @xmath19level below the @xmath74 is the most likely structure for the @xmath1li  spectrum .",
    "this result agrees with @xcite .    from the simultaneous analysis of figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] we can then summarize the results in the following points : i ) we can not establish which of the two states in the doublet @xmath72/@xmath73 is the one at a very low energy , ii ) a @xmath74 resonance below the @xmath19level is not likely , producing too narrow invariant mass spectra , unless the @xmath19 and the @xmath74states are close to degeneracy , iii ) the most likely situation corresponds to a @xmath19level below the @xmath74state , although it can not be extracted by direct comparison with the experimental invariant mass spectra , ( iv ) experiments with a better beam energy resolution are desirable , since the predicted structure in the invariant mass spectra then could be detected and the results from the different spectra directly distinguished .      as a final test , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] some additional observables after fragmentation of @xmath2li on carbon .",
    "the calculations have been performed assuming the best candidates for the @xmath1li spectrum , i.e. the spectra ( c ) and ( d ) in the upper part of fig  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the computed results for both spectra are completely indistinguishable . in part",
    "( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we show the core momentum distribution .",
    "the thin line is the pure calculation while the thick line is the result obtained after convoluting with the experimental beam profile @xcite . in part",
    "( b ) we show the neutron momentum distribution , for which experimental data are not available yet .",
    "in part ( c ) we show the angular distribution , where @xmath75 is the angle between the @xmath1li momentum and the relative momentum between neutron and core after the fragmentation .",
    "the curve is very sensitive to the @xmath5 and @xmath7-wave mixing and the agreement is therefore a strong indication of a @xmath7-wave content of about 40% .",
    "for both the distributions in ( a ) and ( c ) the agreement with the experimental data is very good .",
    "finally we want to discuss the radius of @xmath2li .",
    "it has been extracted by model computations and fitting of measured interaction cross sections .",
    "the results depend somewhat on the assumed density distributions and the reaction models .",
    "we obtain interaction cross sections almost constant between 1030 and 1045 mb for a beam energy varying between 300 and 700 mev / nucleon on a carbon target .",
    "this should be compared to the experimental values of @xmath76  mb at 800 mev / nucleon and @xmath77  mb at 400 mev / nucleon .",
    "also the measured interaction cross sections for heavier targets like copper and lead agree quite well with our model computations using the new neutron- @xmath3li interaction .",
    "our resulting root mean square radius is about 3.2  fm .",
    "it should perhaps be emphasized that a larger range and in particular another choice of radial shape of the three - body interaction could be designed to increase the resulting radius by fractions of a fm possibly without changing anything else .",
    "the recent measurements of the properties of @xmath1li confine the neutron-@xmath3li interaction which is decisive for the elaborate three - body computations of @xmath2li . to use the new information",
    "the @xmath2li model must be realistic and in particular the hyperfine structure arising from spin - spin couplings must be included when the measured energy spectrum of @xmath1li is used for comparison .",
    "we first sketch our method of adiabatic hyperspherical expansion of the faddeev components to determine the structure of @xmath2li from a given set of two - body interactions .",
    "second we sketch the participant - spectator reaction model used for all the fragmentation cross sections .",
    "the neutron - neutron interaction is well known and not crucial as long as the scattering length and effective ranges are correct .",
    "the same could be said about the neutron-@xmath3li interaction but in this case we do not have sufficient information .",
    "we believe that compelling experimental evidence show that an @xmath5-state is present at around 50  kev and a @xmath7-state around 0.5  mev .",
    "we proceed by constructing an @xmath5-state neutron-@xmath3li gaussian potential of range @xmath78 with a deeply bound state and one very low - lying virtual state .",
    "we also construct a @xmath17 gaussian potential with the same range @xmath78 with a bound state at -4.1  mev .",
    "these two potentials produce a density distribution of @xmath3li with the measured root mean square radius of 2.32  fm when @xmath79  fm .",
    "the core density and potential radius is now defined .    the three - body computation for @xmath2li with these interactions supplemented with an appropriate spin - orbit term would lead to a disaster since the additional two neutrons would occupy the low - lying pauli forbidden states of the core - neutrons .",
    "therefore we introduce the phase equivalent potentials for both @xmath15 and @xmath17 states .",
    "these potentials have precisely the same low - energy scattering properties but without the pauli forbidden bound states . for weakly bound three - body systems",
    "this has proven to be an accurate procedure .",
    "although technically difficult this is possible and above all this is a physically appropriate prescription to account for the most important many - body effect in the present context .",
    "the radial shapes of the potentials are not important provided the low - energy scattering properties are correct .",
    "therefore we are content with using gaussians .",
    "the result is that we have two free strength parameters , one for @xmath15 and one for @xmath16-states .",
    "the last part of the neutron-@xmath3li interaction arises from the @xmath3li - spin of @xmath4 coupling to the neutron angular momenta of @xmath15 and @xmath16 resulting in two sets of spin - split states of opposite parity but the same spins of 1 and 2 .",
    "again we maintain the same range parameter @xmath78 of a gaussian potential leaving us with two new strength parameters .",
    "these four parameters may be understood as related to the four different @xmath1li - states .",
    "in addition the properties of @xmath2li can now be used to constrain the parameters .",
    "unfortunately we must also use the three - body potential introduced to fine tune the three - body energy which is necessary even when using a set of two - body interactions reproducing all low - energy scattering properties .",
    "this must be a short range potential and we make it as neutral as possible under that assumption , i.e. we only use it to adjust the binding energy to the measured value and not to upset other unrelated properties .    we know that fragmentation reaction cross sections rather strongly select a neutron-@xmath3li relative @xmath7-wave content within @xmath2li of about 40% .",
    "we also know that most of these cross sections as well as the @xmath2li binding energy and size are essentially independent of the spin - splitting because the pauli principle for the outer neutrons requires at most one identical particle in each of these spin - split states .",
    "if one is occupied the other is as well .",
    "then the average is the most important quantity .",
    "thus a given @xmath7-wave content selects a one dimensional relation between the average energies of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 states .",
    "if the three - body potential had been known or determined from independent sources both the statistically averaged energies could have been found from @xmath7-wave content and three - body binding energy .",
    "still an educated guess using experience provide a reasonable estimate .",
    "we continue with spin - splitting both @xmath5 and @xmath7-waves and demanding that one @xmath5-state must be at 50  kev and one @xmath7-state at 0.54  mev . with the average positions fixed",
    "this provides the spectrum of the four @xmath1li states except that the ordering is yet undetermined and the inaccuracy from the three - body potential is also still present .",
    "therefore we compute sensitive fragmentation data like the invariant mass spectrum which should be able to distinguish between the various @xmath1li spin assignments .",
    "unfortunately the precision of this experimental data is not sufficient to exclude more than two of the four different , but essentially discrete , spin structures .    in conclusion ,",
    "the strong connections between the properties of @xmath1li and @xmath2li are used to produce a consistent description .",
    "experimental constraints from both nuclei are essential .",
    "we maintain the previous level of accuracy in the description of both structure and breakup reactions of @xmath2li .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath1li is confined to have average energies of @xmath5 and @xmath7-states at @xmath80  mev .",
    "the individual @xmath7-states should appear at about 0.54  mev ( most likely the 2@xmath9resonance ) and at @xmath81  mev ( probably the 1@xmath9resonance ) .",
    "the @xmath5-states are at about 50  kev and at @xmath82  mev , where the present knowledge is insufficient or too inaccurate to establish the ordering of the 1@xmath11/2@xmath11 doublet .",
    "furthermore , the three - body potential energy , accounting for three - body polarization , off - shell effects , core - excited states beyond two - body phenomenology or other cluster configurations , must contribute by about @xmath83  mev to the binding energy ."
