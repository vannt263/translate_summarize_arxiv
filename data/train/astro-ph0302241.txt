    "in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , mass is transferred from a late - type star to its compact companion , either a neutron star or a black hole , via an accretion disc .",
    "these systems can be classified according to location within the galaxy , accretion characteristics , and luminosity ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) .",
    "a group of persistent x - ray sources located within @xmath4 longitude and @xmath5 latitude of the galactic centre are known as the `` galactic bulge sources '' ( gbs ; warwick _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ) , and are among the most luminous x - ray sources in the galaxy ( typical @xmath6 @xmath7erg@xmath7s@xmath8 )",
    ". however , the gbs remain the most poorly understood group of lmxbs , due to the heavy obscuration in the direction of the galactic bulge which makes optical study nearly impossible .",
    "the gbs are thought to be neutron star lmxbs , and quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) have been detected in several systems ( _ e.g._van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "attempts to detect orbital variability in the gbs have generally been unsuccessful , suggesting that their periods may be longer than those of canonical lmxbs ( charles & naylor 1992 ) .",
    "on the basis of their x - ray colour - colour diagrams , neutron star lmxbs have also been divided into two classes , known as @xmath1 and _ atoll _ sources ( see van der klis 1995 for a review ) . in this scheme ,",
    "six of the brightest neutron star lmxbs ( which includes several of the gbs ) are classified as @xmath1 sources , while the remainder fall into the atoll category .",
    "recently this distinction has come into question , as several atoll sources show @xmath1-type colour - colour diagrams when examined on a sufficiently long timescale ( muno _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 , gierlinski & done 2002 ) .",
    "nevertheless clear differences remain between the x - ray luminosity and spectral evolution of the canonical @xmath1 sources and that of the atolls .",
    "the infrared provides us with an ideal window for observing these highly obscured systems .",
    "observing in the ir has two primary advantages : the late - type secondaries in lmxbs are brighter relative to the accretion discs , and , more importantly for the gbs , the ratio of @xmath9- to @xmath3-band extinction is @xmath109 ( @xmath11 0.112 ; rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) .",
    "this advantage is particularly crucial in the case of the @xmath1 sources , as only two of the six ( sco x-1 and cyg x-2 ) have optically identified counterparts .",
    "the low galactic latitude of the remaining four @xmath1 lmxbs ensures that they are so heavily extincted in the optical that their counterparts can _ only _ be observed in the ir .",
    "we have undertaken a long - term program of ir observations of x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) , beginning with the discovery via colours or variability of candidates for the counterparts to the x - ray sources using precise x - ray and radio locations ( naylor , charles , & longmore 1991 , hereafter ncl91 ) . using ir spectroscopy",
    ", we then attempt to definitively identify the counterparts to the x - ray sources via detection of accretion signatures in their spectra and also place constraints on the nature of the mass donor stars .",
    "we have obtained ir spectra of a number of systems , including sco x-1 , gx13 + 1 , and sco x-2 ; our data suggests that the secondaries in these lmxbs may be evolved rather than main - sequence stars ( bandyopadhyay _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 and 1999 , hereafter papers i and ii respectively ) .",
    "after sco x-1 , at x - ray wavelengths gx5 - 1 is the brightest of the persistent lmxbs .",
    "it exhibits a variety of qpos and , like all @xmath1 lmxbs , is a radio source ( fender & hendry 2000 ) .",
    "our previous spectroscopy of two stars within the _ einstein _ x - ray error circle ( stars 502 and 503 , as designated by ncl91 ; see figure 1 ) showed no evidence for the signature emission lines we would expect in an lmxb ( paper ii ) .",
    "astrometry by jonker _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) produced an improved ir position for star 513 which was nearly coincident with the atca radio position of gx5 - 1 ( berendsen _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) . therefore of the candidate stars identified by ncl91 , star 513 remained as the prime candidate for the ir counterpart to gx5 - 1 . in this letter",
    "we present @xmath12 photometry and a @xmath3-band spectrum of star 513 , confirming that this star is the ir counterpart to gx5 - 1 .",
    "we obtained @xmath12 images of the gx5 - 1 field using the ukirt fast - track imager ( ufti ) on the 3.8-m united kingdom infrared telescope on mauna kea on the nights of 2001 july 9 and 10 ut .",
    "ufti uses a 1024x1024 hawaii hgcdte array and has a plate scale of 0.091 arcsec pixel@xmath8 , giving a field of view of 93.06 arcsec@xmath13 ; see roche _",
    "( 2002 ) for further information about this instrument . on both nights , a series of five consecutive 60-second images were taken in each filter in a jitter pattern so that the group could be mosaiced and used to create a flat field .",
    "the initial reduction of the images was performed using online data reduction ( orac_dr ) scripts ( wright & leggett 1997 ) .",
    "this process includes dark subtraction , flat field creation and division , masking of bad pixels , and mosaicing of the jittered frames into the final image .",
    "the data were analyzed using standard iraf aperture photometry routines and an 8-pixel aperture , chosen to maximize the target signal relative to the sky background .",
    "relative photometry was performed using several field standards .",
    "finally , absolute photometry of the local standards was performed .",
    "a journal of the ir observations with the measured @xmath12 magnitudes of gx5 - 1 is presented in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath3 magnitudes that we find for star 513 are consistent with those observed by jonker _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) , and there is little evidence for significant variability between the two nights .",
    ".@xmath12 magnitudes of gx5 - 1 ( star 513 ) [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath15 typical wavelength calibration errors are approximately @xmath160.001 @xmath0 m .",
    "+    of the six known @xmath1 sources , gx5 - 1 is the fourth for which an ir counterpart has been spectroscopically identified . of the remaining two @xmath1 lmxbs , gx17 + 2 has had a probable counterpart identified on the basis of hst and keck ir photometry ( deutsch _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 , callanan _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , while to date no candidate counterpart has been identified for gx340 + 0 .",
    "in papers i and ii we presented @xmath3-band spectroscopy of the @xmath1 sources sco x-1 and sco x-2 , which , as in the spectrum of gx5 - 1 presented here , show only emission lines from the accretion disc and/or heated face of the secondary star .",
    "modelling of the sco x-1 spectrum , including the accretion disc contribution , suggested that the mass donor is likely to be an evolved star of spectral type earlier than g5 .",
    "similarly , the lack of optical or ir spectroscopic features associated with the secondary in sco x-2 indicates that the mass - donating star is also of an earlier type than the k / m secondaries expected in atoll lmxbs ( paper ii ) .",
    "although the orbital period of sco x-2 has not been conclusively determined , all the candidate periodicities proposed to date are consistent with an evolved rather than main sequence companion .",
    "finally , the secondary in cyg x-2 has been definitively identified as an evolved a9 star ( casares , charles & kuulkers 1998 ) .",
    "these results led us to hypothesize that the secondaries in the six @xmath1 sources may all be _ early - type evolved stars_. the spectrum of gx5 - 1 presented here shows no absorption features from the secondary which would contradict this hypothesis .",
    "thus the spectra of all four of the six @xmath1 sources with spectroscopically identified counterparts are consistent with mass donors of type g or earlier , rather than `` canonical '' k / m secondaries",
    ".    however , the @xmath1 sources are among the brightest persistent xrbs in the galaxy , and as such we may expect their accretion discs to be exceptionally bright and possibly exceptionally large ( _ e.g._if their orbital periods prove to be substantially longer than those of canonical lmxbs ) . therefore even in the ir it is possible that absorption features from the secondary are obscured by the luminous accretion disc . although our previous modelling of the sco x-1 spectrum indicated that even with a large disc contribution in the @xmath3-band we would expect to see absorption lines if the companion was a k / m star ( paper ii ) , this issue can only be resolved with very high s / n ( @xmath17100 ) spectroscopy .",
    "for example , in the case of grs  1915 + 105 , which is also an extremely bright quasi - persistent x - ray source , @xmath3-band spectra with moderate s / n ( @xmath1030 ) also showed no absorption features ( mirabel _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , marti _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) . however , spectra of grs  1915 + 105 obtained on the vlt with long exposure times and thus much higher s / n revealed the co band absorption features of the secondary ( greiner _ et al .",
    "therefore the definitive test of our hypothesis on the nature of the @xmath1 source mass donors will be to obtain similarly high s / n spectra of sco x-1 , sco x-2 , and gx5 - 1 .",
    "a portion of this work was performed while rmb was supported by a national research council research associateship at the naval research laboratory .                                                        , @xmath14 , and @xmath3 -band images ( left to right ) of the gx5 - 1 field obtained on 10 july 2001 with ufti on ukirt .",
