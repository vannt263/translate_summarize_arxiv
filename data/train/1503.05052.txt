    "a highly desirable goal in cosmology is the acquisition of model - independent data that can be used to test theoretical models and to optimize their parameters .",
    "there are two main types of cosmological observations that shed light on the geometry of the universe : a measurement of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) and the analysis of large - scale structure via the inferred distribution of galaxies .",
    "the quality and quantity of both kinds of data have progressed significantly in recent decades .",
    "cmb anisotropies provide the most evident support for the concordance ( @xmath3cdm ) model , but one should find an independent confirmation of this theory and its parameters because cmb anisotropies may be generated / modified by mechanisms other than those in the standard picture@xcite , and may also be contaminated by other effects@xcite .",
    "cosmological tests using surveys of galaxies have also been developed to provide information on the geometry of the universe : for instance , the hubble diagram or the angular - size test .",
    "however , both of these need some assumptions in order to provide cosmological information .    as of today ,",
    "hubble diagrams constructed from the apparent magnitude ( taking into account k - corrections ) vs. distance or redshift of first - rank elliptical galaxies in clusters require a strong evolution of galaxy luminosities to fit frw cosmologies@xcite . for type ia supernovae@xcite ( snia )",
    "embedded in these galaxies , or for gamma - ray bursts@xcite , one assumes zero evolution , and the standard model fits the data , though some systematic effects may be affecting the result , including a possible evolution in the metallicity of snia progenitors@xcite , possible internal extinctions@xcite , time variations of the grey - dust absorption of light from these supernovae in various types of host galaxies@xcite , and observational selection effects . the angular - size vs. redshift test has been developed by several authors@xcite , using sources seen at radio , near - infrared and visible wavelengths .",
    "all these applications produce an angular size @xmath9 up to @xmath10 , suggesting a strong evolution in galactic radii .",
    "the fact that galaxies with the same luminosity apparently were six times smaller at @xmath11 than at @xmath12 makes it difficult to compare different models.@xcite the surface brightness ( known as the ` tolman ' ) test also depends strongly on the assumption of galaxy evolution , so the results of this test@xcite may vary hugely depending on one s interpretation .    an alternative cosmological test based on",
    "the alcock & paczyski ( ap)@xcite approach evaluates the ratio of observed angular size to radial / redshift size .",
    "this probe is based on the assumption that the distribution of sources is spherical , regardless of distance , and large , so that their size can be easily measured over a broad range of redshifts , preferably extending beyond @xmath13 .",
    "appropriate targets therefore include clusters of galaxies , rather than the individual galaxies themselves , like in some of the other tests described above .",
    "the main advantage of the ap test is that , regardless of whether or not galaxies may have evolved with redshift , it depends only on the geometry of the universe .",
    "however , redshift distortions induced by peculiar velocities@xcite , described in linear perturbation theory by the parameter @xmath14 , can also have an influence . in the linear regime",
    ", the value of @xmath14 measured from redshift distortions corresponds to the solution of the linearized continuity equation ( @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the relative overdensity , and @xmath17 is the velocity field)@xcite .",
    "there is now a way to overcome this possible contamination  via the inclusion in the ap test of an effect with a sharp feature , such as the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak , for which the degeneracy between redshift and geometric and gravitational distortions is almost completely broken@xcite .",
    "the reason is that the value of @xmath18 affects primarily the amplitude of the peak , but its impact on the position is negligible . in this paper , we carry out the ap test using three baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak positions that significantly increase its precision over what has been achieved thus far . in so doing , we demonstrate that the concordance ( @xmath3cdm ) model is disfavored by these new data .",
    "instead , the ap test favors a model with zero active mass , i.e. , with the equation of state @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the total density and pressure of the cosmic fluid@xcite .",
    "given a spherically symmetric structure , or distribution of objects , with radius @xmath19 along the line of sight and a radius @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 with expansion , while @xmath22 for a static universe ) perpendicular to the line of sight , the ratio @xmath23 depends only on the cosmological comoving distance , @xmath24 , and the angular - diameter distance , @xmath25 , and is independent of any source evolution .",
    "previous applications of the galaxy two - point correlation function to measure a redshift - dependent scale for the determination of @xmath26 were limited by the difficulty in disentangling the acoustic length in redshift space from redshift distortions due to internal gravitational effects@xcite .",
    "a serious drawback with this process is that inevitably one had to either pre - assume a particular model , or adopt prior parameter values , in order to estimate the level of contamination . and the wide range of possible distortions ( i.e. , values of @xmath14 ; see , e.g. , eqns .  4 and 5 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the same correlation - function shape resulted in seriously large errors .",
    "but this situation has changed dramatically in the past few years with the use of reconstruction techniques@xcite that enhance the quality of the galaxy two - point correlation function and the much more precise determination of the ly-@xmath27 and quasar auto- and cross - correlation functions , resulting in the measurement of bao peak positions to better than @xmath28 accuracy . in this paper , we determine @xmath26 using three bao peak positions : 1 ) the measurement of the bao peak position in the anisotropic distribution of sdss - iii / boss dr12 galaxies@xcite at the two independent / non - overlapping bins with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , in which a technique of reconstruction to improve the signal / noise ratio was applied .",
    "this technique affects the position of the bao peak only negligibly , so the measured parameters are independent of any cosmological model . and 2 ) the self - correlation of the bao peak in the ly-@xmath27 forest in the sdss - iii / boss dr11 data@xcite at @xmath31 , plus the cross - correlation of the bao peak of qsos and the ly-@xmath27 forest in the same survey@xcite .    in all of these measurements ,",
    "the template used for the correlation function was drawn from the concordance model .",
    "however , the actual shape of the bao peak does not significantly affect the calculation of its centroid position , both along the line - of - sight and in the direction perpendicular to it , when its fwhm is very narrow",
    ". any shape could be used , and the results would be the same .",
    "the peak s narrowness strongly reduces the impact of redshift distortions , which affect the peak s amplitude , but not so much its location . any modifications to this amplitude as a function of distance may produce a second - order shift to the centroid , but always negligibly .",
    "reconstruction also significantly reduces the effects of redshift - space distortions at the bao scale , isotropizing the correlation function@xcite .",
    "this conclusion is reflected , for instance , in the fact that , although the errors for the parameter @xmath14 quoted in table 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite are very large , the relative error bars for @xmath32 and @xmath33 are much smaller . if the bao peak measurements were sensitive to @xmath14 , their error bars would be much bigger .",
    "the redshift distortions produce systematic errors of order of 1 - 2% in @xmath32 and @xmath33@xcite , which are already included in the errors we use for the data , though some authors@xcite give a slightly more pessimistic estimation of the error associated with the hubble parameter .",
    "but this situation has improved even more recently@xcite , with the report of systematic uncertainties in @xmath34 that are even smaller : @xmath35 for the ap parameter and @xmath36 for the distance scale  and these were considered conservative .",
    "this impressive precision amplifies the probative power of these measurements , given that statistical errors as small as @xmath28 are now achievable .    the angular - diameter distance @xmath32 and hubble constant @xmath33 are related to the variable @xmath26 via the expression @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the measured angular - diameter distance assuming an expanding universe , that is , @xmath39 if there is expansion and @xmath40 for a static universe . very importantly , the quantity @xmath26 is independent of the uncertain ( co - moving ) acoustic scale @xmath41 , since @xmath42 , while @xmath43 , so the dependence on @xmath41 cancels out in the product .",
    "( sometimes an alternative definition of this ratio , @xmath44 , has been used in the literature , but these properties are the same for both working definitions . )    at low redshift , the values of the @xmath45 of ref .",
    "@xcite lead directly to @xmath46 , @xmath47 . at high redshift , we have @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( see eqns .  22 and 23 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , plus the adoption of a correlation coefficient@xcite of -0.6 between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which lead to @xmath52 .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath26 are found by propagating the errors in @xmath33 and @xmath32 through equation  ( [ y ] ) including the covariance terms derived from the given correlation coefficients .",
    "these three are the only bao measurements currently available that measure both @xmath32 and @xmath33 with small statistical errors .",
    "other reported values ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) are older , less accurate versions of these same boss measurements . the available wigglez data@xcite are not included because they are much less accurate than boss data : they have relative error bars of 20 - 30% for @xmath26 .",
    "and we do not include clustering measurements of @xmath32 and @xmath33 based on the anisotropic two  point correlation function at shorter scales@xcite because these are biased by the pre - assumption of a cosmological model , or the adoption of priors , used to characterize the internal redshift distortions ( i.e. , the parameter @xmath14 ) .",

    "additionally , we plot @xmath26 for the @xmath8 cosmology@xcite , in which @xmath62 and has a @xmath26 coincident with that of the static / tired light ( stl ) model@xcite , though its representation of the universe is based on the frw metric with expansion , while stl is static .",
    "this coincidence arises because for stl @xmath63 , which corresponds to a factor @xmath64 difference with the angular diameter distance @xmath32 in the @xmath8 universe .",
    "the latter also has a hubble parameter @xmath65 , while @xmath66 is constant in stl .",

    "however , our results are based on the simultaneous analysis of the available model - independent bao data ( at @xmath29 , @xmath88 and @xmath2 ) , which more emphatically exclude the standard model , while favoring the @xmath8 universe . in this paper , we do not combine the ap test data with the cmb or supernova data , because this step would dilute the information concerning the anomaly reflected in our results .    our conclusions are stronger than the tension reported in refs .",

    "the ap test , however , compares the observed product @xmath90 with that of the model , and since both bao measurements of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are higher than those expected in the standard model , the ap discrepancy is larger than simply that of the quadrature sum of the two individual discrepancies . and while aubourg et al.@xcite did not find any models that substantially improved the agreement between theory and the ly-@xmath27 forest bao measurement without worsening the corresponding fit to other data",

    "@xcite highlights the dramatic improvement in the measurement of the bao peak position that has led to the important conclusions drawn in this paper .",
    "though the measurements of @xmath26 based on the galaxy two - point correlation function used in that earlier work were good enough to rule out all but the concordance and stl models ( the @xmath8 universe was not included in that comparison , but its @xmath26 function is identical to that of stl ) , the errors arising from the contamination due to internal redshift distortions were still too large for us to discriminate between these two cosmologies . as we can see from figure  1 , however , the significant improvement in the precision with which the bao peak position is measured now@xcite disfavors the standard model .      the surprising and emphatic result summarized in figure  1 now compels us to examine one of @xmath3cdm s most impressive successes  the interpretation of the cmb and bao lengths as arising from a single , consistent acoustic scale  and whether this identification survives into the @xmath8 framework",
    ". an acoustic angular size , @xmath91 , has been measured in both the temperature and polarization power spectrum , most recently with _ planck_@xcite .",
    "this ` standard ruler ' is believed to be responsible not only for the multi - peak structure in the cmb power spectrum , but also for leaving its indelible imprint on the large - scale structure we see today . in many ways",
    ", the optimization of the parameters in @xmath3cdm relies critically on the correct interpretation of this ` sound horizon . '",
    "one may question some of the assumptions made in calculating the acoustic scale in @xmath3cdm , including its estimation from the comoving distance @xmath41 traveled by a sound wave rather than from an actual solution to the geodesic equation in an expanding medium , but the fact that @xmath92 is evidence in support of the standard model .",
    "let us now see what happens in the @xmath8 universe .",
    "the measured value of @xmath93 at @xmath85 is @xmath94 mpc , assuming the _ planck _ hubble constant @xmath95 km s@xmath96 mpc@xmath96 ( ref .",
    "we have recently initiated an analysis of the cmb power spectrum and its angular correlation function@xcite in the context of @xmath8 , which has yielded an optimized value of @xmath97 for the ratio @xmath98 of the angular - diameter distance @xmath99 over the maximum fluctuation size @xmath100 at decoupling . in @xmath8 , @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the hubble constant at the last scattering surface .",
    "therefore , the comoving cmb acoustic scale in this model is given by the simple expression @xmath103 ( remembering that @xmath104 and @xmath105 in this cosmology ) .",
    "that is , @xmath106 mpc , which is fully consistent with the bao value @xmath107 mpc measured at @xmath85 .",
    "if the results of the ap test are reliable , and @xmath8 is indeed the correct cosmology , it is therefore likely that the cmb and bao length scales have a common origin , just as they apparently do in @xmath3cdm as well .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to carry out additional high - precision measurements of the bao scale using a broader redshift coverage than is currently available .",
    "a quick inspection of figure  1 suggests that to distinguish between the various models , the ap test is best suited to redshifts @xmath108the higher the better .",
    "the results of our analysis in this paper show that , if the measurements of @xmath32 and @xmath33 derived from the bao peak anisotropic distributions are correct , the concordance @xmath3cdm model , optimized to fit snia and cmb data , does not pass the ap test . in light of the ap results",
    ", one may begin to question its status as a true ` concordance ' model .",
    "instead , the ap test using these model - independent data favors the @xmath8 universe , which has thus far also been favored by model selection tools in other one - on - one comparative tests with @xmath3cdm@xcite .",
    "the consequences of this important result are being explored elsewhere , including the growing possibility that inflation may have been unnecessary to resolve any perceived ` horizon problem ' and therefore may have simply never happened@xcite .",
