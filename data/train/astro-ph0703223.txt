    "examining batse grb light curves gives the impression that the @xmath7-ray activity , so intense during the first @xmath8  100 s , begins to weaken with time , all the while displaying pulses with relatively constant widths .",
    "if this evidence requires for its explanation a very powerful structured relativistic wind from an active central engine that becomes less vigorous with time , then the implied grb explosion mechanism is very different than if this data is taken as evidence for a single explosive event where the grb pulses are made by external shocks from a weakening blast wave that interacts with material in the circumburst medium .    the grb afterglow revolution , initiated by beppo - sax and continued with hete-2 and integral , gave for the first time grb source redshifts and distances and therefore apparent isotropic powers and energies . with the opening angle of the relativistic jet inferred from the achromatic beaming breaks in optical light curves , the absolute energy of a grb",
    "is fixed to the uncertainty in the efficiency of radiation production .",
    "the tools of standard relativistic blast - wave physics for the afterglow external shock emissions allow one to test for uniform or wind - formed circumburst media , and determine the @xmath14 and @xmath15 parameters for assumed jet structures @xcite .",
    "fitting the statistical data on the grb redshift and opening angle distributions can determine the intrinsic jet opening angle and whether a top - hat model for grb jet structure gives good agreement with the data @xcite .",

    "s to a burst so that the xrt , with excellent sensitivity , can get a clear picture of the evolution of the 0.3  10 kev x - ray emission . in large numbers of grbs , there are steep declines in the x - ray emission at the end of the prompt x - ray luminous phase hundreds of seconds after the start of the grb @xcite , an extended plateau phase @xcite , and x - ray flares @xcite , which in some cases have durations that are a small fraction of the time since the start of the grb .",
    "extrapolation of the bat into the xrt band gives an almost continuous x - ray light since the grb trigger @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of this data is complicated not only by the rich detail revealed by swift but , for statistical studies , by its unusual triggering method , which makes the assignment of a threshold flux problematical @xcite .",
    "because the swift bat uses a coded mask from which images of the grb photons can be formed , a lower peak flux than pre - swift telescopes can be identifiable as a grb by using both rate and image triggers . a broader dynamic range , from 0.004 s to 26 s ,",
    "is used for the rate trigger .",
    "differences in redshift distributions of swift grbs compared with the grbs detected with batse , beppo - sax and hete-2 , which had comparable triggering criteria can , however , mainly be understood by different peak flux sensitivities of swift and pre - swift detectors @xcite .",

    "energy dissipation in an accretion torus or through the blandford - znajek process drives a narrow collimated jet through the stellar envelope . during the early prompt phase , continued activity drives successive waves of collimated relativistic plasma through the sn shell .",
    "collisions between the shells make grb pulses .",
    "later activity and peculiarities in the light curves are attributed to refreshed outflows or internal shocks from late outbursts of the engine .",
    "interpreting rapid variations in the grb x - ray light curve as activity of the central engine , then the engines in some grb sources must be on for rest - frame times @xmath19 s after the start of the event @xcite .",
    "early calculations of the spectral and temporal behavior of the grb pulses in an internal shock model were made by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the efficiency difficulties for the internal shock model @xcite are reduced by large lorentz - factor contrasts between different shells @xcite , which constrains the collision radius and @xmath20 peak energies under the requirement of thomson thinness @xcite .",
    "for the internal shock / colliding shell model , as well as for the external shock model , efficiency concerns are ameliorated by the large hadronic energy content in the prompt phase that escapes to form the ultra - high energy cosmic rays @xcite .    a complete description of the collision between two relativistic shells that follows both the hydrodynamics and radiation physics needed to calculate emission spectra and light curves from different pulses in grbs , necessary to test the internal shell model , has only been recently treated , in a series of papers by @xcite . here",
    "we present a complete and systematic analysis of the collision between a cold grb blast wave shell and a cloud with a spherical cap geometry in an external shock model .",

    "this result is demonstrated analytically in section 4 , and illustrated by monte carlo simulations of grb light curves .",
    "we conclude that the x - ray flares observed with swift are compatible with an external shock model if the grb blast wave shell interacts with a clumpy surrounding external medium and does not spread transversely .",

    "@xcite demonstrated that an expanding blast wave would , if briefly illuminated over a large portion of its surface covering the doppler cone , make progressively longer pulses in accordance with the relation @xmath440 .",
    "the tendency for pulse lengthening can be avoided if a small fraction of the blast wave surface area within the doppler cone were illuminated at any one times , but this was thought to require an unreasonable number of illuminating regions (  clouds \" ) .",
    "one approach is to estimate a maximum  surface filling factor \" of radiating sites consistent with measured variability , using kinematic arguments @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that highly variable light curves can not be constructed from blast - wave interactions with surrounding density inhomogeneities by superposing pulses made near the outer region of the doppler cone to show how they overlap due to the large angular timescales ; hence the sources of grbs must require an active central engine to make discrete pulses .",
    "@xcite showed that this argument , made also more recently by @xcite and @xcite , mistakenly uses the angular time scale near the outer edge of the doppler cone , and misses a number of important points : one is that the beaming factors , not considered in these papers , heavily weight the total fluence for near on - axis clouds , and even more so the pulse peak flux because of the smaller kinematic variability timescale for nearly on - axis clouds ; another is the different ( observer ) times for the clouds nearly on - axis as compared with those off - axis , so that flux ratios from different parts of the shell are time - dependent ; a third is the assumption that clouds are distributed with azimuthal symmetry within the doppler cone ; a fourth is that the beaming factor of the relativistic jet that forms @xmath7-ray pulses in the prompt phase may be smaller than @xmath441 and the typical angles inferred from optical afterglow breaks , which will reduce the importance of off - axis events .",
    "the crucial role of the narrow cold blast - wave fluid shell ( not the shocked fluid shell considered by @xcite ) to ensure a strong forward shock has also been overlooked in past studies .",
    "@xcite claim that the lack of pulse - width evolution in batse grb light curves favors internal shock models ; @xcite , in the absence of any quantitative consideration of external shocks , argue that xrt pulse spreading in swift grbs favors internal shock models . from our simulations , we see that this effect is subtle at best in the unlikely condition when the clouds are  uniformly randomly \" situated .",
    "realistic cloud clustering properties or a narrow @xmath7-ray jet could obscure this effect completely .",
    "@xcite derive the time - scale ratio @xmath442 for a spherical shell and suggest that the observational data indicate a clustering in the value @xmath442 that rules out the external shock model , but nowhere consider observational biases for the detection of flare profiles with larger or smaller time - scale ratios , or whether this time - scale ratio could reflect cloud properties .    as shown in the simulations , stv in the external shock model with moderate ( @xmath366% ) efficiency",
    "is possible if the blast wave interacts with clouds with thick columns and sizes @xmath443 , because then the condition of  local spherical symmetry \" @xcite is broken .",
    "the shortest pulses carrying a significant fraction of the total fluence are made by interactions of the blast wave with small clouds at angles @xmath444 to the observer line - of - sight @xcite .",
    "efficiency concerns are reduced if the fraction of energy dissipated as x - rays and @xmath7 rays is a small fraction of the total @xcite .",
    "we have critically examined whether external shock processes can make short timescale x - ray and @xmath7 ray variability in the @xmath7-ray luminous phase and the early afterglow phase , extending to @xmath445 s after a grb trigger .",
    "the result is simple : external shocks can only make the erratic variability observed in grb light curves if the cold fluid shell ejected by the impulsive burst event does not spread significantly from its initial characteristic width @xmath446 at the time of the grb explosion , where @xmath447 , assumed to be @xmath448 s , is the time of the energy release in the explosion frame .",
    "the question of whether lack of shell spreading is a valid assumption , at least within the doppler cone primarily sampled by the observer , is an open question but plausibly valid .",
    "a crucial point is that an external shock model for the rapid variability is feasible because the grb blast wave is still in its coasting phase , and has not yet reached the adiabatic self - similar phase .",
    "let us follow the implications if this assumption were allowed .",
    "one way to interpret grb light curve data is to suppose that there is a single impulsive burst of energy , and all subsequent phenomenology is a consequence of the collimated ultra - relativistic blast wave interacting with its surroundings @xcite .",
    "external shocks are the basis for the success that the relativistic blast - wave physics model has had in interpreting grb afterglows @xcite ; we also suppose that its success can be translated to the prompt phase .",
    "the properties of the surrounding medium , as implied by extensive evidence on grb host galaxy studies , is determined by the type of grb progenitor , which is a massive ( @xmath449  20 m@xmath450 ) star lacking a h envelope whose core collapses to form a type 1b / c sn .",
    "the snr and the progenitor stellar wind , including effects of a possible binary companion @xcite , form a complicated surroundings that imprints its structure on the grb light curves @xcite .",
    "the brief impulsive energy releases in grb explosions , which for neutrino - mediated processes are most efficient for @xmath451 ms timescales , are compatible with brief collapse events or phase transitions from stellar cores to compact objects , for example , from neutron star to black hole or neutron star to a quark star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this collapse event would follow by minutes , hours , days or more a type 1b / c supernova that forms a supramassive , rotationally supported neutron star / magnetar .",
    "this picture is a two - step collapse model , like the supranova model of @xcite , though with a short delay .",
    "such a picture , orthogonal in all respects to the collapsar model except for the primary role of high mass stars as long - duration grb progenitors , has a great deal of explanatory and predictive capability . here",
    "we point out some of the attractive features of such a picture :    1 .",
    "the direct collapse of the evolved core of a massive star to a black hole in the collapsar model , avoiding core bounce , requires new routes for the production of @xmath452ni .",
    "this makes the similarity between the peak optical rest frame @xmath453 magnitudes ( taken as a proxy for @xmath452ni production ) measured in sne associated with grbs and type 1b / c sne not associated with grbs @xcite a remarkable coincidence .",
    "two - step collapse processes avoid this coincidence by forming @xmath452ni through neutron - star core bounce .",
    "2 .   energy reservoir .",
    "the discovery @xcite of a standard energy reservoir , or at least a clustering of beaming - corrected absolute energies towards a value @xmath454 ergs , modulo an uncertain efficiency to convert explosion energy into @xmath7 rays , fixes the energy budget of the grb explosion .",
    "the collapse of a rotationally - supported neutron star to a black hole , or the transition from a degenerate neutron fluid to quark state , could liberate kinetic energies approaching a constant maximum energy that may not defy ability or require excessive assumptions to calculate .",
    "if the explosion involves a neutrino or poynting - flux mediated interaction , values of collimated electromagnetic energy of @xmath32 ",
    "@xmath455 ergs could be released in a second collapse to a black hole .",
    "3 .   complex circumburst medium .",
    "a magnetar phase @xcite follows , even if only by minutes , the first collapse event , and drives a strong pulsar wind to disrupt , thread , and render extremely complex the surrounding medium , in particular , the supernova remnant shell produced in the first collapse event .",
    "the work of @xcite shows the profound impact on the circumburst medium that this phase can have for long ( month  yr ) delays .",
    "4 .   clean environment .",
    "the usov phase cleans the environment except for dense clumps formed at distances where the strong radiation pressure can be withstood  and these are the clumps that form the clouds in the external shock model .",
    "the mhd winds effectively drive out all surrounding material except for very dense clouds , possibly allowing for the existence of density contrasts of magnitude defined by eq .",
    "( [ n0ncl ] .",
    "the clouds themselves would be expanding , but on a much longer timescale than the period of activity of the system .",
    "close to the explosion trigger , the environment of a rotationally - supported neutron star is baryon - clean @xcite .",
    "5 .   explanation for chromatic x - ray and optical afterglow beaming breaks .",
    "@xcite compare swift bat x - ray light curves with optical light curves taken from a variety of telescopes for 6 grbs , finding several instances where the x - ray light curves appear to decay chromatically with respect to the optical light curves .",
    "possible explanations for these observations are evolving @xmath14 and @xmath15 parameters and the addition of the ( synchrotron self-)compton for a beamed outflow ( illustrated numerically by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which plausibly explains the light curves of grb 050922c and the lack of x - ray breaks observed with swift @xcite .",
    "the optical light curves of grbs 050607 , 050802 , and 050713a are too poorly sampled to draw definitive conclusions , and the optical and x - ray light curves in grb 050319 appear to follow each other except for a final high optical datum .",
    "this leaves only grb 050401 to explain .",
    "more and better data is clearly needed . 6 .",
    "explanation for the decay and plateau phases observed with swift . within the context of the external shock model for a grb taking place within a uniform surrounding environment , i recently showed that an intense photohadronic phase , effectively depleting internal grb blast wave energy , could cause the x - ray light curves to exhibit rapid flux declines @xcite .",
    "after the discharge , the blast wave regains its nonradiative character to form the plateaus observed with swift . because grbs showing a steep decay phase have significantly decelerated , the blast wave should then have entered the adiabatic self - similar phase when only broad x - ray flares can result from large density contrasts @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that grbs showing the most extreme decay phases , e.g. , grbs 050315 , 050416a , 050713b , 050814 , and 050915b , display smooth subsequent light curves @xcite , though grb 050916 provides a counterexample and a challenge to this interpretation .",

    "observations of grbs with the glast gbm and lat will monitor the compton components in the spectrum of a grb .",
    "definite correlations between the leptonic synchrotron and ssc components are expected , which behave in stark contrast to photohadronic @xmath7-ray components that vary independently of the lower - energy lepton synchrotron component .",
    "glast will search for photohadronic emission components and , in conjunction with detectors such as icecube , test multiwavelength and multi - channel predictions @xcite .",
    ".   predictions . with respect to the short - delay supranova model ,",
    "the confirming prediction is to glimpse the grb progenitor in its magnetar phase prior to the second - step collapse to form the grb .",
    "analysis of radio , optical , x - ray , or @xmath7-ray emissions to obtain @xmath456 and @xmath457 in the brief interval between the two collapse events is now only possible with broad field - of - view detectors with poor sensitivities .",
    "unfortunately , optical supernova discovery generally happens within a few weeks after the supernova event , by which time a second collapse would have happened .",
    "so for the short - delay supranova intervals consistent with the offset between nearby grbs and their supernova emissions @xcite , this prediction is not promising except to test the standard supranova model @xcite .",
    "+ a definitive test of the collapsar model is to find a supernova taking place well in advance of the grb , so that the grb has no detectable supernova emissions .",
    "development of telescopes with wide field - of - view optical survey capabilities , like pan - starrs or snap , holds promise to rule out the collapsar model for specific grbs ( c.dermer & a.  drago , unpublished , 2006 ) , and could also provide a database to search for magnetar activity in advance of a grb .",
    "a detailed analysis of the interaction between a relativistic blast wave and a stationary cloud was performed in the limit that that the cloud width @xmath107 , so that the shell density remains effectively constant during the interaction .",
    "synchrotron light curves and spectra from such interactions were calculated for a range of cloud densities , sizes , and locations , for blast - wave coasting lorentz factors @xmath458 and 300 , and for different blast - wave widths .    in order to produce short timescale variability in the external shock model",
    ", the shell width parameter @xmath4 must be @xmath459 , as demonstrated both analytically and numerically .",
    "if this model assumption is valid , then the external shock model can explain the generic spectral shape of grb pulses , rapid variability in grb light curves observed with batse , and the delayed x - ray flares observed with swift .",
    "the tendency of the grb pulses or x - ray flares to diminish in intensity with time is a consequence of the expansion of the blast wave .",
    "the durations of grb pulses reflect the dimensions of the surrounding thick - columned clouds .",
