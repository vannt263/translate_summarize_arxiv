    "the crab nebula is the remnant of a supernova exploded in 1054 a.d . at a distance of @xmath02 kpc .",
    "it contains a 33 ms pulsar that powers a wind of relativistic particles .",
    "the interactions of these particles with the remnant gas , photons and magnetic field produce a non - thermal radiation extending from radio waves to tev gamma rays ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "most of the emission is generally attributed to synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons and positrons .",

    "a second component arises above @xmath0400 mev , interpreted as inverse compton ( ic ) of the same electrons scattering off synchrotron photons and cmb photons .",
    "the crab nebula is one of the most luminous sources of very high energy ( vhe ) gamma rays in the sky , and the first source to be detected at tev energies @xcite .",
    "thanks to its high flux and apparent stability it is considered a reference source in gamma ray astronomy . detected by many experiments , both cherenkov telescopes @xcite and air shower arrays @xcite , the crab nebula was often used to check the detector performance , including sensitivity , pointing accuracy and angular resolution .    in 2010",
    "september the agile satellite unexpectedly detected a strong flare from the direction of the crab nebula at energies above 100 mev .",
    "it lasted two days , with a maximum flux three times higher than the average value @xcite , later confirmed by fermi @xcite . from then on , fermi and agile reported some more flares , characterized by a rapid increase and decay of the flux , typically lasting a few days .",
    "the most impressive occurred in 2011 april , when the observed flux was @xmath010 times higher than usual @xcite .",
    "the measured sed shows a new spectral component emerging during flares , peaking at high energies ( up to hundreds mevs in the 2011 april flare ) , attributed to a synchrotron emission of a population of electrons accelerated up to energies of 10@xmath16 ev .",
    "the fermi - lat data also show that these sharp emission peaks are superimposed to long - lasting smoother modulations with timescales of weeks or months @xcite .",
    "the observed flux variations are attributed to the nebula , since the pulsar emission was found to be stable within 20@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "however the origin of this activity is still unclear . in this scenario",
    ", observations at higher energies could provide precious information to understand the mechanisms responsible for this behaviour .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the data recorded by the air shower detector argo - ybj during the flares , showed an increase of the crab flux at tev energies with a moderate statistical significance , in 3 out of 4 flares @xcite .",
    "these results have not been confirmed by imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) because the moon light hampered the observations .",
    "however , sporadic and short measurements carried out during the first part of the 2010 september flare by magic and veritas show no evidence for a flux variability @xcite .",
    "the observations by veritas and hess during a flare in 2013 march ( when argo - ybj was already switched off ) , report a counting rate consistent with the steady flux @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed analysis of the argo - ybj data , carried out with a better reconstruction of the shower arrival direction , obtained applying quality cuts on the events .",
    "the study concerns not only the flaring episodes , but the whole crab nebula data set , consisting of more than five years of observation .",
    "the argo - ybj layout and operation mode are presented in section 2 , with a particular attention to the performance in gamma ray astronomy . in section 3 the analysis technique to extract the gamma ray signal",

    "section 4 reports the energy spectrum evaluation and discusses systematic errors . in section 5",

    "<S> the argo - ybj air shower detector monitored the crab nebula gamma ray emission from 2007 november to 2013 february . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated signal , consisting of @xmath03.3 @xmath1 10@xmath2 events , reached the statistical significance of 21.1 standard deviations . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained energy spectrum in the energy range 0.3 - 20 tev can be described by a power law function dn / de = i@xmath3 ( e / 2 tev)@xmath4 , with a flux normalization i@xmath3 = ( 5.2 @xmath5 0.2 ) @xmath1 10@xmath6 photons @xmath7 s@xmath8 tev@xmath8 and @xmath9 = 2.63 @xmath5 0.05 , corresponding to an integrated flux above 1 tev of 1.97 @xmath1 10@xmath10 photons @xmath7 s@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic error is estimated to be less that 30@xmath11 for the flux normalization and 0.06 for the spectral index . assuming a power law spectrum with an exponential cutoff dn / de = i@xmath3 ( e / 2 tev)@xmath4 @xmath12 ( -e / e@xmath13 ) , the lower limit of the cutoff energy e@xmath13 is 12 tev , at 90@xmath11 confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> our extended dataset allows the study of the tev emission over long timescales . over five years , </S>",
    "<S> the light curve of the crab nebula in 200-day bins is compatible with a steady emission with a probability of 7.3 @xmath1 10@xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> a correlated analysis with fermi - lat data over @xmath04.5 years using the light curves of the two experiments gives a pearson correlation coefficient @xmath15 = 0.56 @xmath5 0.22 . </S>",
    "<S> concerning flux variations on timescales of days , a `` blind '' search for flares with a duration of 1 - 15 days gives no excess with a significance higher than four standard deviations . </S>",
    "<S> the average rate measured by argo - ybj during the three most powerful flares detected by fermi - lat is 205 @xmath5 91 photons day@xmath8 , consistent with the average value of 137 @xmath5 10 day@xmath8 . </S>"
