    "s previous paper @xcite , the author provide a combinatorial description of a finite thurston type ordering by introducing a new normal form of positive braids which we call the @xmath2-normal form . using the @xmath2-normal form description , we proved that the restriction of a finite thurston type ordering to the positive braid monoid @xmath6 is @xmath5 .",
    "there are other well - known submonoids of the braid groups , called the _ dual braid monoids _ denoted by @xmath3 . as in the positive braid monoids ,",
    "the dual braid monoids also define a garside structure of the braid groups and these two monoids are closely related each other @xcite .",
    "the main theme of this paper is to study a finite thurston type ordering of braid groups by using the dual braid monoid .",
    "although the dual braid monoids and positive braid monoids have almost the same algebraic properties , sometimes the dual braid monoids provide much better result than the positive braid monoids .",
    "fromentin studied the dehornoy ordering , which is a special one of the finite thurston type orderings , by the dual braid monoids in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . using the dual braid monoid",
    ", he showed that every braid admits a @xmath7-definitive quasi - geodesic , which has been conjectured for a long time .",
    "thus it deserve to study the structure of finite thurston type orderings on dual braid monoids .",
    "we extend our code constructions in author s previous paper @xcite for the dual braid monoids .",
    "we present a combinatorial description of finite thurston type orderings by introducing the new normal form of dual positive braids , which we call the @xmath2-normal form .",
    "the definition of the @xmath2-normal form of dual positive braids is parallel to the definition of the @xmath2-normal form of positive braids . for a finite thurston type ordering @xmath0",
    ", we define the code of a dual positive word , which is an sequence of parenthesized integers .",
    "the set of codes has two natural lexicographical orderings @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the @xmath2-normal form of a dual positive braid @xmath10 is defined as a word representative of @xmath10 which has the maximal code with respect to the ordering @xmath9 .",
    "we denote the code of the @xmath2-normal form of @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "we also present an alternative definition of the @xmath2-normal form , which is more algebraic and useful to actual computation .",
    "fromentin defined the normal form of dual positive braids called the _ rotating normal form_. we introduce the _ tail twisted rotating normal form _ of dual positive braids , which extends the rotating normal form .",
    "we show that the @xmath2-normal form is identified with the tail - twisted rotating normal form , thus the @xmath2-normal form can also be regarded as an extension of the rotating normal forms .",

    "then for @xmath12 , @xmath13 holds if and only if @xmath14 holds .    using this @xmath2-normal form description ,",

    "although the above results are almost parallel to the positive braid monoid case , but the proofs of theorems are essentially different .",
    "we need a new approach to prove the main theorem , because the proof we used in the positive braid monoid case does not work . in the positive braid monoid case , we did not compare two positive braids @xmath15 and @xmath21 directly .",
    "instead , we constructed two new braids @xmath22 and @xmath23 which are easy to compare the ordering .",
    "we proved the @xmath2-normal form description for positive braid monoid @xmath6 by comparing @xmath24 with @xmath25 instead of comparing @xmath15 with @xmath21 .",
    "however , in the dual braid monoid case , the same approach fails .",
    "it is too complex to construct a word which corresponds to @xmath24 although it might be possible for small @xmath26 .",
    "this is because the dual braid monoids have the much larger number of generators so there are very many patterns of subwords which play the similar role of @xmath24 .    to overcome this combinatorial difficulty",

    "we show that the @xmath2-normal form is a word which acts of the arc of a curve diagram most effectively ( proposition [ prop : keyprop ] ) .",

    "the curve diagram approach of orderings first appeared in @xcite to give a geometric description of the dehornoy ordering .",

    "3 .   each component of @xmath45 is a disc or an one - punctured disc .",
    "we regard isotopic two curve diagrams as the same curve diagram .",
    "we say curve diagrams @xmath40 and @xmath46 are tight if they form no bigons .",
    "a bigon is an embedded disc in @xmath34 whose boundary consists of two subarcs @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "if we equip a complete hyperbolic metric on @xmath34 and realize both @xmath40 and @xmath46 as a union of geodesics , then @xmath40 and @xmath46 are tight .",

    "thus the order - type of @xmath4 is greater than @xmath5 .",
    "therefore we conclude that order - type of @xmath4 is @xmath5 .",
    "we remark that from the above theorem , @xmath505 and @xmath4 are order - isomorphic .",
    "however , as we remarked in the remark [ rem : difference ] , the ordinal of a positive braid @xmath10 in the set @xmath4 might be very different from the ordinal in the set @xmath505 .",
    "we only need to prove @xmath509 for all @xmath510 .",
    "since @xmath0 is left - invariant , by multiplying @xmath511 , which belongs to the center of @xmath1 for sufficiently large @xmath192 , we can assume @xmath512 .",
    "let @xmath82 be the ordering on @xmath1 defined by a conjugate of @xmath0 by @xmath513 .",
    "that is , the ordering @xmath82 is defined by @xmath514 if and only if @xmath515 holds .",
    "then @xmath82 is also a finite thurston type ordering . now from theorem",
    "[ thm : main ] , @xmath516 holds so @xmath517 holds .",
    "this is interesting in the following sense .",
    "although we had already established a similar combinatorial description of finite thurston type orderings using the positive braid monoid @xmath6 in @xcite , but in the positive braid monoid @xmath6 case we essentially used the property @xmath506 to prove the counterpart of theorem [ thm : main ] . therefore the @xmath2-normal form description for the positive braid monoid does not give a proof of property @xmath506 although it give a new interpretation of finite thurston type orderings .",
    "finally we prove theorem [ thm : complexity ] .",
    "the analysis of computational complexity of rotating normal forms and the dehornoy orderings has been done in @xcite .",
    "the computation of a tail twisted rotating normal form is essentially the same as computation of rotating normal form except the tail parts , which are merely computations of the maximal right divisors .",
    "since the computations of maximal right divisors are fundamental step of the computation of the rotating normal forms , so the computational complexity of the tail - twisted rotating normal form is identical with the rotating normal forms .",
    "as we mentioned above , the assertion ( 1 ) follows from fromentin s result @xcite .",
    "we can find two dual positive braid word @xmath21 and @xmath518 such that @xmath519 in time at most @xmath520 ( see @xcite , chapter 9 ) .",
    "for the dual braid monoid , the garside element @xmath521 has length @xmath26 , so the length of @xmath21 and @xmath518 are at most @xmath522 .",
    "now @xmath19 is equivalent to @xmath523 and the computation of the @xmath2-normal form of @xmath21 and @xmath518 are at most @xmath20 from the assertion ( 1 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that total computational complexity is at most @xmath20 .",
    "we remark that this computational complexity is smaller than the positive braid monoid case and quadratic with respect to both @xmath26 and @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , for a given braid word @xmath15 of length @xmath16 with respect to artin generators @xmath524 , we can regard @xmath15 as a braid word of length less than @xmath16 with respect to the band generators @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the @xmath2-normal form method for dual braid monoid gives more efficient method to compute finite thurston type orderings .",
