    "the 7/10 tune space is not only a 10th betatron resonance but also a spin depolarization resonance .",
    "therefore , there is not enough tune space between 2/3 and 7/10 to hold the beam  beam generated tune spread when the bunch intensity is greater than @xmath4 .    to reduce the beam  beam tune spread and also to compensate the non - linear beam  beam resonance driving terms , we plan to install head - on beam  beam compensation in the rhic p - p operation .",

    "the rhic polarized proton operational experience shows that a lower working point between 2/3 and 7/10 is preferable to obtain a better beam  beam lifetime and to preserve the proton polarization at store . in the simulation ,",
