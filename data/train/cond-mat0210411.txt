    "submitted to an applied shear flow , many complex liquids show an interesting coupling between their internal structure and the flow field . for smectic @xmath0 like systems ( including block copolymers , lyotropic systems and side - chain liquid crystalline polymers )",
    "this coupling may induce reorientation of the layers .",
    "experiments on a variety of systems which differ significantly in their microscopic details show nevertheless striking similarities in their macroscopic behavior under shear .",
    "the systems under investigation include block copolymers @xcite , low molecular weight ( lmw ) liquid crystals @xcite , lyotropic lamellar phases ( both lmw @xcite and polymeric @xcite ) , and liquid crystalline side - chain polymers @xcite . these experiments use either a steady shear ( typically for the low viscosity systems e.g. in a couette cell ) or large amplitude oscillatory shear ( often in the highly viscous polymeric systems , e.g. in a cone - plate or plate - plate geometry ) . due to these experimental differences",
    "a direct comparison between the different systems is not always straightforward .",
    "the common features of all these experiments can be described as follows . starting with an aligned sample where the layers are parallel to the planes of constant velocity ( `` parallel '' orientation ) , the layering is stable up to a certain critical shear rate @xcite . at higher shear rates two different situations are observed .",
    "depending on the system either multi - lamellar vesicles @xcite ( `` onions '' , typically in lyotropic systems ) or layers perpendicular to the vorticity direction @xcite ( `` perpendicular '' orientation , typically in solvent free systems ) form . in some of the systems a third regime",
    "is observed at even higher shear rates with a parallel orientation @xcite .",
    "if the starting point is rather a randomly distributed lamellar phase , the first regime is not observed @xcite .",
    "this last point illustrates that experiments on layered liquids depend on the history of the sample . in our further discussion",
    "we will restrict ourselves to systems showing a well aligned parallel orientation before shear is applied .",
    "the experimental similarities between different systems indicate , that the theoretical description of these reorientations can be constructed , at least to some extent , from a common basis independent of the actual system ( on the other hand , a description including the differences between the systems under investigation must refer closer to their microscopic details ) .",
    "when looking for a macroscopic description , the well established standard smectic @xmath0 hydrodynamics @xcite is a good starting point for such a theoretical approach .    as first shown by delaye et al .",
    "@xcite and clark and meyer @xcite thermotropic smectic @xmath0 liquid crystals are very sensitive against dilatations of the layers . above a very small , but finite",
    ", critical dilatation the liquid crystal develops undulations of the layers to reduce the strain locally .",
    "oswald and ben - abraham considered dilated smectic @xmath0 under shear @xcite . when a shear flow is applied ( with a parallel orientation of the layers ) , the onset for undulations is unchanged only if the wave vector of the undulations points in the vorticity direction ( a similar situation was later considered in @xcite ) . whenever this wave vector has a component in the flow direction , the onset of the undulation instability is augmented by a portion proportional to the applied shear rate",
    "no destabilizing mechanism for well aligned parallel layers is present in the standard smectic @xmath0 hydrodynamics .",
    "recently we proposed an extended hydrodynamic description @xcite of smectic @xmath0 liquid crystals . using both , the director of the underlying nematic order and the layer normal of the smectic layers , we showed the possibility of a shear - induced undulation instability in well aligned parallel layers . within the framework of irreversible thermodynamics ( which allows the inclusion of dissipative as well as reversible effects ) we derived macroscopic hydrodynamic equations for the system and performed a linear stability analysis of these equations ( using a number of approximations ) .",
    "as always , a linear stability analysis is limited to the onset of the first instability .",
    "other theoretical approaches to these reorientation phenomena have been undertaken by bruinsma and rabin @xcite , zilman and granek @xcite ( both papers are considering the influence of the shear on layer fluctuations ) and williams and mackintosh @xcite ( minimizing a free energy density including a coupling to the applied shear stress ) . to our knowledge ,",
    "no macroscopic hydrodynamic approach besides @xcite has been published up to now .",
    "the present paper is structured as follows : after a brief review of the model in sec . [",
    "sec : mod ] and its implementation in sec .",
    "[ sec : imp ] we extend the basic model of @xcite in the following sections .",
    "especially we include the cross coupling to the velocity field and the moduli of the nematic and smectic order parameters .",
    "it turns out that the coupling terms to the velocity are important since they can change the critical parameters significantly .",
    "we find that the moduli of the order parameters also show undulations and , thus , regions with a reduced order parameter can be identified .",
    "the comparison of the different levels of approximations shows that the basic model is contained in this more general analysis as a special case .",
    "we also compare our results to experiments and molecular dynamic simulations and show that an oscillatory instability is extremely unlikely to occur .",
    "in a smectic @xmath0 liquid crystal one can easily define two directions : the normal to the layers @xmath2 and an average over the molecular axes , the director , @xmath3 . in the standard formulation of smectic @xmath0 hydrodynamics these two directions",
    "are parallel by construction . only in the vicinity of phase transitions ( either the nematic ",
    "smectic @xmath0 or smectic @xmath0smectic @xmath4 ) it has been shown that director fluctuations are of physical interest @xcite .",
    "nevertheless @xmath3 and @xmath2 differ significantly in their interaction with an applied shear flow .",
    "we consider a situation as show in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] . a well aligned smectic @xmath0 liquid crystal is placed between two parallel and laterally infinite plates .",
    "the upper plate ( located at @xmath5 ) moves with a constant velocity @xmath6 to the right and the lower plate ( at @xmath7 ) moves with the same velocity in the opposite direction ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "thus the sample is submitted to an average shear given by @xmath9 . as mentioned above",
    ", a three dimensional stack of parallel fluid layers can not couple directly to an applied shear flow .",
    "neither does the layer normal : it stays unchanged as long as the flow direction lies within the layers .",
    "in contrast , it is well known from nematodynamics that the director experiences a torque in a shear flow . this torque leads  in the simplest case  to a flow aligning behavior of the director .",
    "the key assumption in the model of @xcite is that this torque is still present in a smectic @xmath0 liquid crystal and acts only on the director @xmath3 and not on the layer normal @xmath2 .",
    "an energetic coupling between @xmath3 and @xmath2 ensures that both directions are parallel in equilibrium",
    ".    submitted to a shear flow the layer normal will stay unchanged , but the director will tilt in the direction of the flow until the torques due to the flow and due to the coupling to the layer normal balance one another . for any given shear rate a finite , but usually small , angle @xmath10 between @xmath3 and @xmath2 will result .",
    "this finite angle has important consequences for the layers : since the preferred thickness of the layers is proportional to the projection of the director on the layer normal , a finite angle between those two directions is equivalent to an effective dilatation of approximately @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : effdilat ] ) .",
    "if we assume a constant total sample thickness and exclude effects of defects , the system can accommodate this constraint by layer rotations .",
    "a global rotation of the layers is not possible , but they can rotate locally ( as in the case of dilated smectic @xmath0 liquid crystals @xcite ) .",
    "this local rotation of the layers leads to undulations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : undul ] .",
    "these undulation are a compromise between the effective dilatation ( which is not favorable for the system ) and the curvature of the layers due to the undulations ( which costs energy ) . in the static case of dilated smectic @xmath0 liquid crystals",
    "no direction is preferred , but oswald and ben - abraham @xcite have shown that this symmetry is broken if an additional shear is applied to the system . in this case",
    "the standard formulation of smectic @xmath0 hydrodynamics predicts that the wave vector of the undulations will point along the neutral direction of the shear . in this paper",
    "we will assume that this result of oswald and ben - abraham also holds in the case of our extended formulation of smectic @xmath0 hydrodynamics ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : undul ] ) .      to generate the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations we follow the procedure given by the framework of irreversible thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "this method has successfully been applied in many cases to derive the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations of complex fluids ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of this method is its systematic way of deducing the governing equations .",
    "once the set of variables is given , the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations follow by applying basic symmetry arguments and thermodynamic considerations .",
    "let us briefly review the essential ingredients to this procedure ( for more details of the method see @xcite and for our model @xcite ) .",
    "for a given system the hydrodynamic variables can be split up in two categories : variables reflecting conserved quantities ( e.g. the linear momentum density , the mass density etc . ) and variables due to spontaneously broken continuous symmetries ( e.g. the nematic director or the layer displacements of the smectic layers ) . additionally , in some cases non - hydrodynamic variables ( e.g. the strength of the order parameter @xcite ) can show slow dynamics which can be described within this framework ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    using all these variables the relations , which form the starting point for the further calculations , can be constructed .",
    "these relations are : the energy density @xmath12 , the dissipation function @xmath13 , the and the gibbs - duhem relation .",
    "to illustrate the idea of our model we split up @xmath12 and @xmath13 into several parts according to the different origin of the variables .",
    "* conserved quantities ( index @xmath14 ) * symmetry variables ( index @xmath15 ) * the modulus of the order parameter ( index @xmath16 )    in the spirit of our model two order parameters play a role : the nematic tensorial order parameter @xmath17 and the smectic @xmath0 complex order parameter @xmath18 . for practical reason we use the director @xmath19 and the modulus @xmath20 in the uniaxial nematic case [ @xmath21 and the layer displacement @xmath1 and the modulus @xmath22 in the smectic @xmath0 case [ @xmath23 . here , as in the rest of the paper",
    ", we refer to the system of coordinates defined in sect .",
    "[ sec : mod ] .",
    "we note that @xmath1 is only a good variable if we consider small deformations of the layers . for large layer deformations",
    "the phase @xmath24 is the appropriate variable @xcite . in our further discussion",
    ", we will concentrate on the parts due to symmetry variables and the order parameters , while for terms already present in the isotropic fluid see e.g. @xcite .    .summary of the notation . in these definitions we use the transverse kronecker symbol @xmath25 . due to the thermodynamic stability of the systems",
    "the following combinations of constants must be positive : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "for the last relation we used the equivalence of @xmath28 and @xmath33 .",

    "we made use of the results by oswald and ben - abraham @xcite , who have shown that in standard dilated smectic @xmath0 under shear the first instability will set in with a wave vector along the neutral direction of the flow ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "after inserting the above ansatz in the linearized set of ( partial differential ) equations , a set of coupled linear equations is obtained to determine @xmath37 and @xmath36 . from the standard smectic @xmath0 hydrodynamics",
    "it is known , that shear does not destabilize the layers . since our extended formulation of the smectic @xmath0 hydrodynamics is equivalent to the standard smectic @xmath0 hydrodynamics for vanishing external fields ( e.g. shear rate ) , we assume that the layers are stable for low enough shear rates , i.e. @xmath40 for small shear rates .",
    "so @xmath41 marks the set of external parameters ( shear rate ) and material parameters above which @xmath34 grows .",
    "typically we hold the material parameters fixed and the only external parameter is the shear rate .",
    "the solvability condition of the corresponding set of linear equations gives a relation between the shear rate [ and tilt angle @xmath42 , which is directly connected to the shear rate , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta_0 ] ) below ] , @xmath36 and the wave vector @xmath43 . for every",
    "given @xmath43 a specific shear rate ( and tilt angle @xmath42 ) can be determined which separates the stable region ( below ) from the unstable region ( above ) .",
    "this defines the so called curve of marginal stability ( or neutral curve ) @xmath44 .",
    "if , for any given set of external parameters , the tilt angle @xmath42 lies above the curve of marginal stability for at least one value of @xmath43 , the spatial homogeneous state is unstable and undulations grow . the smallest shear rate ( tilt angle ) for which undulations can grow",
    "is called the critical shear rate ( tilt angle ) . technically speaking",
    ", we solve @xmath45  in many cases we can set @xmath46 , see below .",
    "we point out that this linear analysis is only valid at the point where the first instability sets in . without further investigations",
    "no prediction of the spatial structure of the developing instability can be made .",
    "also the nature of the bifurcation ( backward or forward ) must be determined by further investigations .    for practical reasons we used dimensionless units in our numerical calculations .",
    "the invariance of the governing equations under rescaling time , length and mass allows us to choose three parameters in these equations to be equal to unity .",
    "we will set @xmath47 and measure all other quantities in the units defined by this choice .",
    "nevertheless we will keep these quantities explicitly in our analytical work .    to extract concrete predictions for experimental parameters from our calculations",
    "is a non - trivial task , because neither the energetic constant @xmath27 nor the rotational viscosity @xmath48 are used for the hydrodynamic description of the smectic @xmath0 phase ( but play an important role in our model ) .",
    "therefore , we here rely on measurements in the vicinity of the nematic - smectic @xmath0 phase transition . measurements on low molecular weight liquid crystals made by litster @xcite in the vicinity of the nematic - smectic @xmath0 transition indicate that @xmath27 is approximately one order of magnitude less than @xmath26 . as for @xmath48",
    "we could not find any measurements which would allow an estimate of its value in the smectic @xmath0 phase . in the nematic phase @xmath48 increases drastically towards the nematic - smectic @xmath0 transition ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations on a molecular scale are also a promising approach to determine these constants @xcite .    due to the complexity of the full set of governing equations , we will start our analysis with a minimal set of variables ( @xmath10 , @xmath49 and @xmath1 ) and suppress the coupling to the other variables ( see sec .

    "step by step the other variables will be taken into account .",
    "the general picture of the instability will turn out to be already present in the minimal model , but many interesting details will be added throughout the next sections . in comparison to our earlier work",
    "@xcite we now use the way of normalizing @xmath3 and @xmath2 derived above .",
    "this will lead to some small differences in the results but leaves the general picture unchanged .",

    "[ sec : oscill - inst ] and [ sec : anisotric - viscosity ] ) .",
