    "in recent years sensitive rosat and asca observations have revealed that a class of objects classified on the basis of their optical spectra as narrow  line seyfert 1 galaxies ( hereinafter nls1 ) exhibits peculiar and rather extreme properties in the x  ray band . large amplitude x - ray variability with timescales as fast as a few minutes ( boller et al .",
    "1997 ) and extremely soft x ",
    "ray spectra in the rosat band are common among these objects ( boller et al . 1996 ) .",
    "asca observations have extended the rosat results to higher energies . on average , nls1 galaxies have steeper x  ray spectra ( brandt et al . 1997 ) and higher variability amplitude variance ( fiore et al .",
    "1998 ; leighly 1999a ; turner et al .",
    "1999a ) compared to seyfert 1s with broad optical lines .",
    "the anti  correlation between the x  ray spectral slope and the h@xmath2 fwhm is now a well  established observational property tested across a wide range of x  ray luminosities ( laor et al .",
    "1997 ) , suggesting that nls1 represent an extreme of seyfert activity , possibly linked to an extreme value of a fundamental physical parameter .    the asca observation of rej 1034 + 393 can be considered a breakthrough in the understanding of nls1 , because it was the first object of this class observed above 2 kev .",
    "the 0.510 kev spectrum is dominated by a strong soft component below @xmath0 2 kev ; a steep ( @xmath1 2.6 ) power law tail at higher energies and an ionized iron k@xmath3 line at 6.7 kev ( although detected only at the 2@xmath4 level ) are also present ( pounds et al .",
    "ionized iron lines have been discovered in a few other objects observed by bepposax ( comastri et al .",
    "1998 , paper i ) and asca ( turner et al . 1998",
    "; leighly 1999b ) , suggesting that the fundamental parameter could be a particularly high accretion rate ( pounds et al .",
    "1995 ; laor et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we have started an observational programme to study a sizeable sample of nls1 with bepposax with the aim of investigating the broad band x  ray spectral and variability properties of these objects .",
    "we are taking advantage of the increased effective area at high energies , especially above 5 kev , where the mecs detectors provide the best opportunity to investigate the iron line properties .",
    "arakelian 564 ( @xmath5 = 0.0247 , @xmath6 = 14.16 ) is an ideal candidate for such an investigation being the brightest nls1 in the 210 kev band .",
    "previous rosat and asca observations revealed a complex x  ray spectrum with a few absorption / emission features around 1 kev ( brandt et al . 1994 ; leighly 1999b ; vaughan et al . 1999a ; turner et al .",
    "1999b , hereinafter tgn99 ) .",
    "more recently , an rxte / pca observation ( vaughan et al .",
    "1999b , hereinafter v99 ) provided the first spectrum of this object up to 20 kev .",
    "the most remarkable result is the presence of a deep ionized edge at @xmath0 8.5 kev interpreted as reflection from an ionized disc . in the present paper",
    "we report the results of 3 bepposax observations of ark 564 together with a high  quality optical spectrum obtained at la silla one year before the first x  ray observation .",
    "optical spectra of ark 564 were obtained in photometric conditions at the eso 1.52 m telescope on 1996 october 1 , using the boller & chivens spectrograph with a 127 mm camera and a loral / lesser thinned ccd with @xmath7 pixels .",
    "the pixel size is @xmath8 , and the projected scale on the detector 0.82  arcsec  pixel@xmath9",
    ". the grating used has 600  grooves  mm@xmath9 .",
    "the spectra were obtained through a 2-arcsec wide slit , at a resolution of 4.6   .",
    "two integrations of 1200 seconds each were obtained , with mid - point airmasses of 2.05 and 1.97 .",
    "standard techniques were used to reduce the spectra , using the noao iraf package .",
    "the reduction included the correction of the atmospheric absorption bands of o@xmath10 and h@xmath10o , obtained by interpolating and normalizing the continuum of the spectrophotometric standards .",
    "a short exposure of ark 564 obtained during the same night through an 8  arcsec slit was used to correct the narrow - slit spectra for light losses and differential refraction .",
    "this was achieved by fitting a low - order polynomial to the ratio between each narrow - slit spectrum and the broad - slit one , and dividing each narrow - slit spectrum by the corresponding fit . despite this correction",
    ", the low culmination point of the target with respect to the observing site still leaves a considerable uncertainty on the spectrophotometric quality of the data , particularly at @xmath11   .",
    "the two narrow - slit spectra were averaged and yielded the final spectrum shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the calibration curves obtained during the night and the individual spectra coincide to within @xmath125% , thus we consider the spectrophotometric quality of the red part of the spectrum to be of this order .      while the widths of the permitted lines fully justify the classification of ark 564 as a nls1 , other characteristics of its optical spectrum are not as extreme as usually observed among nls1 . in particular",
    ", the source displays a strong and rich forbidden line spectrum , while the fe  ii lines have strengths more similar to those of normal seyfert 1 nuclei rather than the high values displayed by many nls1 : the ratio between the fe  ii  @xmath136250 blend and h@xmath2 is 0.6 , only slightly higher than the typical value for classic seyfert 1 spectra ( joly 1988 ) .",
    "the optical continuum is flat and likely to include a significant stellar component . for this reason , and because of the uncertainty in the calibration of the blue part of the spectrum",
    ", no attempt was made to fit a continuum across the entire spectrum . instead",
    ", local straight - line continua were fitted under the main lines in order to measure their fluxes .",
    "the fluxes of h@xmath2 and [ o  iii]@xmath14 were measured after subtraction of the strongest blending lines with suitable templates . for fe  ii  @xmath15 and fe",
    "ii  @xmath16 we used the profile of h@xmath3 scaled by a factor 0.015 , under the reasonable assumption that the lines in multiplet 42 are of equal intensity .",
    "to subtract [ o  iii]@xmath17 we used the deblended profile of [ o  iii]@xmath14 scaled by one third .",
    "the intensity of the narrow components of the balmer lines , and the [ n  ii ] lines which contaminate h@xmath3 were estimated by subtracting the [ o  iii ] template , scaled in order to obtain a smooth residual profile .",
    "the fluxes , widths and equivalent widths of the individual lines and components thus obtained are listed in table  1 .    0.3truecm    .integrated fluxes , fwhms , and equivalent widths of the main optical emission features [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the line  like feature around 1 kev , originally discovered by asca , was successfully modelled by a power law continuum plus a gaussian emission line ( tgn99 ) or by an ionized reflection model plus an o viii recombination edge at 0.87 kev ( v99 ) . in order to compare the bepposax data with the asca observations , the same models were fitted to the lecs plus mecs spectra .    the power law plus gaussian line model returns an acceptable fit only for very high values of the line width ( @xmath18 0.6 or even larger ) , leaving the line energy basically unconstrained .",
    "the profile of such a broad gaussian line is equivalent to a blackbody continuum absorbed at low energy by the galactic column density .",
    "the addition of an o viii recombination edge ( model redge in xspec ) improves the statistical quality of the power ",
    "law plus ionized reflection fit .",
    "the best  fit values for the plasma temperature ( @xmath0 9 @xmath19 10@xmath20 k which is consistent with the assumed disc temperature of 10@xmath21 k ) and the o viii recombination feature ew ( @xmath0 90 ev ) are in agreement with the v99 results .",
    "however , systematic residuals are left below 0.8 kev , suggesting that the recombination feature is too narrow to fully account for the shape of the soft x  ray spectrum .",
    "we conclude that a single power law modified by warm / hot absorption and reflection features does not adequately represent the broad  band spectrum , and especially the soft x  ray spectral shape , of ark  564 as observed by bepposax .",
    "the discrepancy with the asca results is likely to be due to both the different energy resolutions and spectral coverages of the detectors onboard asca and bepposax . in order to check whether the relatively weak emission line detected by asca could have been missed by the bepposax lecs ,",
    "a simulated 100 ks bepposax observation of ark  564 was produced with the best ",
    "fit asca parameters quoted by tgn99 .",
    "we found that the simulated spectrum could be described well by a double blackbody plus power  law model , indicating that weak soft x ",
    "ray emission features can be only marginally studied with bepposax . on the other hand",
    ", the lack of sensitivity of the asca instruments below @xmath0 0.6 kev coupled with the calibration uncertainties at these energies prevents a detailed modelling of the soft x  ray continuum and of the strength of any emission / absorption feature .",
    "an emission line at @xmath0 1 kev is still statistically required if the asca spectrum is fitted with a blackbody plus power law model ; however , the derived line ew is lower than that obtained without a blackbody component ( see sect .",
    "6 ) .    a further discrepancy between the bepposax and asca results concerns the best ",
    "fit energy of the iron emission line , which is consistent with a neutral origin in the asca data .",
    "moreover , while tgn99 find evidence for a strong ( ew @xmath0 500 ev ) line with a broad and asymmetric profile , in the v99 analysis the emission feature is best fitted with a much weaker ( ew @xmath0 100 ev ) and narrow gaussian .",
    "it is plausible that the different energy resolution and sensitivities of the detectors onboard asca and bepposax coupled with the different prescriptions for the underlying continuum might account for part of this discrepancy .",
    "the x  ray spectral properties of ark  564 as observed by bepposax fit fairly well with the leading hypothesis of a higher accretion rate , relative to the eddington value , and of a smaller black hole mass in nls1 with respect to broad  line seyfert 1 nuclei ( e.g. pounds et al .",
    "1995 ; boller et al . 1996 ; laor et al .",
    "the steep soft excess , best fitted with the high  energy tail of a hot thermal component , is explained by a shift of the accretion disc spectrum in the soft x ",
    "the strong flux of soft photons could lead to a strong compton cooling of the coronal electrons and thus to a steep hard tail . in some models",
    "the disc surface layers become strongly ionized when the accretion rate approaches the eddington limit which fits nicely with the detection of ionized iron features .",
    "the reprocessing features originating in a highly ionized disc have been studied by matt et al .",
    "( 1993 , 1996 ) and , more recently , by ross et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and nayakshin et al .",
    "the intensities of the iron k@xmath3 features as measured by bepposax are in relatively good agreement with the model predictions for an ionization parameter @xmath22 10@xmath23 erg cm s@xmath9 ( compare table  4 ) .",
    "the best  fit values for the k@xmath3 edge energy and optical depth are also consistent , within the errors , with the asca plus rxte observation ( v99 ) , lending further support to the ionized reprocessor scenario . as discussed by ross et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the pexriv model in xspec provides only a first approximation to the spectral shape of an ionized reflector .",
    "unfortunately , the quality of the present data and the lack of mecs response above 10 kev does not allow testing of more detailed models .",
    "the increased reflectivity of the ionized accretion disk at low energies can not completely account for the strong soft excess in the bepposax data .",
    "an important consequence of the need for primary soft excess emission is that the intensity and the origin of the 1 kev soft x  ray feature discovered by asca must probably be reconsidered . even though there is no convincing evidence of such a feature in the bepposax data",
    ", we can not completely rule out this possibility .",
    "we argue that the soft x  ray line intensity can not be as strong as claimed by tgn99 and v99 . indeed , when fitting the asca data with a blackbody plus power law model , a 1 kev line is still required .",
    "the model dependent ew ( 2050 ev ) is lower than the best fit value reported by tgn99 of @xmath0 70 ev and more similar to the best fit value of 29 ev reported by leighly ( 1999b ) from an independent analysis of the same asca data . as discussed by tgn99 , a strong soft x ",
    "ray line can be only marginally reproduced by emission from a warm / hot gas .",
    "emission models computed for a wide range of column densities , ionization states , covering factors and iron abundances indicate that the largest ews are of the order of 2030 ev .",
    "these results highlight the importance of a robust measurement of the underlying continuum shape for a better understanding of the origin of soft x ",
    "ray features in nls1 . in conclusion , the soft x  ray spectrum of ark  564 remains far from being unambiguously and convincingly explained .",
    "better quality spectra , which will be obtained by the already scheduled _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ observations , are needed to settle this still controversial issue .    the non  simultaneous optical , uv and x  ray spectral energy distribution ( sed )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the uv data were retrieved from the hst archive using xstarview and have been calibrated by the standard pipeline .",
    "they agree relatively well with those presented in crenshaw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and with the blueward extrapolation of the optical data .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the full uv data set is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the flattening of the steep soft x  ray spectrum towards the lowest accessible x ",
    "ray energies suggests that the energy density peaks in the soft x  ray band with a behaviour similar to that observed in re j1034 + 393 ( puchnarewicz et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the lack of variability and the simultaneity of the re j1034 + 393 optical  uv and x  ray data allowed spectral fits with accretion disc models .",
    "the preferred interpretation was a nearly edge  on accretion disc accreting at 0.30.7 l@xmath24 onto a low mass black hole ( m @xmath0 a few 10@xmath21 m@xmath25 ) .",
    "it is likely that a similar set of parameters for the black hole mass and accretion rate are responsible for the ark  564 optical to x  ray spectrum .",
    "however , given the large  amplitude variability and the lack of simultaneous multifrequency observations , no attempt has been made to fit the observed sed with a disk model .",
    "it is interesting to compare the ark  564 and re j1034 + 393 sed with that of ton  s  180 ( paper i ) : the 3 nls1 in the bepposax core programme for which optical data are available . the ton  s  180 optical to x  ray spectrum ( fig .  5 in paper i ) peaks somewhere at longer wavelengths ; as a consequence , the bulk of the energy density is emitted in the optical  uv band .",
    "indeed the shape of the soft  excess component of ton  s  180 is best fitted by a steep power law while the soft x  ray components in ark  564 and re j1034 + 393 show a low  energy downwards curvature characteristic of thermal blackbody  like spectra .",
    "on the other hand , the 3 objects have similar high energy properties such as steep 210 kev spectra and ionized iron features ( though in re j 1034 + 393 only a marginal detection has been reported ; pounds et al . 1995 ) suggesting that the high  energy spectrum is independent of the peak of the overall energy output .",
    "it is worth noting that the sed peak seems to be correlated with the intensity of optical fe  ii multiplets which are particularly strong in ton  s  180 .",
    "further x  ray observations and coordinated optical ",
    "uv campaigns are needed to clarify some of these issues .",
    "we have analysed bepposax data and a high - quality optical spectrum of the bright narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxy ark  564 .",
    "our main results are the following :    @xmath26 the optical emission  line intensities and widths clearly confirm the nls1 nature of ark  564 .",
    "the fe  ii multiplets are not particularly strong and are similar to those of normal seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "@xmath26 the optical to x  ray spectral energy distribution peaks in the soft x  ray band with a behaviour similar to that observed in re j1034 + 393 .",
    "a rapidly accreting , low mass black hole provides the most likely interpretation of the broad band observations .",
    "we thank all the people who , at all levels , have made the sax mission possible .",
    "this research made use of saxdas linearized and cleaned event files ( rev.2.0 ) produced at the bepposax science data center .",
