    "<S> , we obtain an excellent fraction delay of 74@xmath15 .    in the backward - retrieval configuration , the input and recall pulses propagated in opposite directions and were detected by two different detectors ( pd1 and pd2 in fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it extremely difficult to measure their phase correlation . because the beat - note data of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 showed excellent phase correlation between the input and forward - recalled pulses , the phase of the input pulse must have been encoded to the atomic spin wave during the storage . the retrieval process in either the forward or backward direction maps both amplitude and phase of the spin wave to the recall pulse </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the input and backward - recalled pulses should also be phase coherent . under an assumption of perfect phase correlation , we took the square root of the input and retrieved pulses ( after time reversal ) as the fields in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) and estimate the classical fidelities of the two recall data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) all to be greater than 99% , which is better than the theoretical fidelity in the forward retrieval . </S>",
    "<S> the superior result is due to nearly perfect similarity between the input and time - reversed output pulse shapes .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated an efficient eit - based optical memory with cold atoms . </S>",
    "<S> our results in the forward retrieval show a se of 69% . using the space - time - reversing method plus optimum pulse shape , we further enhanced the se to 78% . </S>",
    "<S> this efficiency is normalized with respect to the collection efficiencies of the photodetectors in the forward and backward directions . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation of se at a high od is mainly caused by the dephasing rate of about 5.5@xmath35@xmath36@xmath11 . in our system , </S>",
    "<S> the saturation resulted from the far - detuned switching effect and the laser frequency instability , rather than from the fwm process which limits the se with hot atomic vapors . </S>",
    "<S> the measured decay time of the memory is about 98 @xmath0s . allowing the se to be 50% </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained a large fd of 74 . </S>",
    "<S> we also employed a beat - note interferometer to verify that the classical fidelity of the recalled pulse was better than 90% and nearly independent of the storage time . </S>",
    "<S> there is excellent phase coherence between input and output pulses as well as good agreement between theoretical and experimental values of fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> although the experiments were done with coherent optical pulses , the eit light - matter interface may possibly be applied to single - photon quantum states due to its quantum nature . </S>",
    "<S> our work may bring the eit - based quantum memory toward practical quantum information applications . </S>"
