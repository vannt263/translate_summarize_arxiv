    "the application of the operator product expansion ( ope ) to the phenomenological study of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been very successful in the determination of the quark and gluon substructure of the nucleon .",
    "the ope allows the formal separation of cross sections for high - energy processes such as deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) into perturbatively calculable partonic cross sections and nonperturbative contributions parametrized by parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the factorization of the cross section becomes especially clean in the bjorken limit , where the energy @xmath4 and four - momentum squared @xmath0 transferred to a nucleon with mass @xmath5 both become infinite , with the ratio @xmath6 fixed .    in the bjorken limit",
    "the dis process becomes dominated by scattering at light - cone space - time distances @xmath7 , with the expansion made in terms of products of singular and non - singular terms around the light - cone .",
    "the singularities are isolated in the perturbative wilson coefficients , while the non - singular terms are all the possible operators allowed by the underlying quantum field theory .",
    "the coefficient of the operators of lowest twist ( where twist is defined as the dimension minus the spin of the operator ) contains the most singular terms .",
    "operators in the expansion with higher twist are less singular , and at large @xmath0 are suppressed by powers of @xmath8 .",
    "while this framework has met with considerable success in describing data at high @xmath9 and large final state hadron masses @xmath10 , many recent high - precision experiments @xcite have been performed at lower energies , with @xmath0 down to @xmath11  gev@xmath12 , where the use of the asymptotic bjorken limit formalism is more questionable .",
    "in addition to the strong coupling constant @xmath13 becoming large , at low @xmath0 the higher twist power corrections , which describe nonperturbative multi - parton correlations , become increasingly important . furthermore , even at leading twist , there are corrections arising from purely kinematic effects associated with finite values of @xmath14 , usually termed target mass corrections ( tmcs ) @xcite .    to perform reliable perturbative qcd based analyses which include data in the low @xmath0 region ,",
    "a careful treatment of the subleading @xmath8 corrections is essential , and global pdf analyses @xcite have only recently begun to take such effects systematically into account .",
    "studies of quark - hadron duality @xcite have also strongly suggested that data at low @xmath15 can be described ( to within @xmath1615% ) by leading twist parton distributions . a more basic question , however , is whether one can consistently define leading twist parton distributions in the presence of tmcs , that can be valid at low @xmath0 over the entire range of  @xmath1 .    the first analysis to tackle this question was by georgi and politzer ( gp ) @xcite , who proposed taking tmcs into account by defining distributions at low @xmath0 in terms of the nachtmann scaling variable , @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 this leads to a specific prescription for removing tmcs from measured structure functions that has been used extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , problems with the standard tmc prescription were soon realized @xcite in the behavior of the target mass corrected structure functions in the vicinity of @xmath19 . in particular , functions expressed in terms of @xmath17 over the interval @xmath20 necessarily extend into the unphysical region between the elastic limit @xmath21 and @xmath22 for any finite value of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this not only violates the conservation of energy and momentum , but also makes structure functions nonzero at @xmath23 , at odds with the expectation that leading twist functions should vanish at the elastic point @xcite .    as a possible remedy , de  rujula _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite noted that in the threshold region analyses of data should not be performed in terms of leading twist structure functions alone , without also incorporating the effects of higher twist operators .",
    "they argued that a nonuniformity in the limits as @xmath24 and @xmath25 renders the entire approach untenable at very low @xmath15 , when higher twists exceed @xmath26 for the @xmath27-th structure function moment .",
    "attempts were also made by tung and collaborators @xcite to phenomenologically remove the threshold problem by utilizing an _ ansatz _ to smoothly merge the moments in the perturbative region at large @xmath0 with their correct threshold behavior in the @xmath24 limit , although such a prescription is not unique .",
    "steffens and melnitchouk @xcite extended this approach by proposing threshold - dependent distributions which exactly satisfy threshold kinematics at all @xmath0 , at the expense of sacrificing the universality of pdfs in the presence of tmcs .",
    "other approaches based on collinear factorization , starting with the seminal work of ellis , furmanski and petronzio @xcite , avoid the inversion of moments by implementing tmcs directly in momentum space within the parton model @xcite .",
    "these , too , however , suffer from prescription dependence @xcite , or do not extend to all orders in @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "in addition , even though they do not invoke distributions at @xmath2 , all these formulations nevertheless retain the problem of nonvanishing structure functions at @xmath28 .",
    "given the desire to maximally utilize the recent precision structure function measurements at large @xmath1 @xcite , as well as those planned for the near future @xcite , there is a pressing need to address the question of tmcs and the consistency of parton distributions with mass corrections at finite @xmath0 .",
    "a more reliable treatment of the high-@xmath1 region at moderate @xmath0 is important not only in providing a better understanding of the quark structure of the nucleon in the deep valence region @xcite , it is also vital for constraining cross sections at collider energies through the evolution to lower @xmath1 at higher @xmath0 values @xcite .    in this paper",

    "we have sought to illustrate the inherent problem with the standard tmc formulation , already evident in the pioneering work of georgi and politzer @xcite , in the treatment of the @xmath19 region and the inversion of the structure functions from their moments . in particular , we have critically analyzed the definition of pdfs in the presence of tmcs , and discussed the consequences of the violation of energy and momentum conservation in the standard tmc analysis . historically it has been argued @xcite that the problem in the threshold region exists because at low @xmath0 the higher twist contributions can not be neglected .",

    "we contend that the introduction of the nachtmann variable @xmath17 , which appears naturally in the standard tmc implementation , does not lead to self - consistent parton distributions that are valid at all @xmath1 .",

    "the virtue of this approach is that the resulting tmc functions can be consistently inverted from their moments , without ever encountering unphysical regions of kinematics or violating energy and momentum conservation .",

    ", rapid oscillations ensue as one approaches the elastic scattering limit , and beyond @xmath146  gev it becomes prohibitively difficult to tame these with a finite number of higher order terms . at @xmath158  gev@xmath12 , for example , even summing over @xmath165 terms allows for a smooth tmc function up to @xmath166 ( or @xmath167  gev ) .",
    "fortunately , such low @xmath15 values are well outside the range typically encountered in perturbative qcd analyses of dis data , and in practice will not pose any serious restrictions .",
