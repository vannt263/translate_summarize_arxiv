    "the formation process of the intermediate - mass black holes ( bhs ) through direct collapse has been investigated by numerical and theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "such bhs , due to their much larger mass than the bhs form after the death of pop iii stars ( typically several tens @xmath3 , see @xcite ) , are good candidates of the seeds of the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) which were observed at @xmath11 @xcite . in this direct collapse black hole ( dcbh )",
    "scenario , the formation of a dcbh requires a host halo : ( a ) with virial temperature above @xmath8  k ; ( b ) exposed to strong lyman - werner ( lw , photons with energy between 11.2 ev and 13.6 ev ) radiation or near - infrared ( nir ) radiation with energy above @xmath12  ev @xcite . under these conditions , the @xmath13 can no longer form and the gas in this halo can only cool through ly@xmath14 emission , leading to a quasi - isothermal contraction without fragmentation and finally allowing a bh seed with mass @xmath15 to form at the center of the halo .",
    "if such dcbhs largely formed at @xmath16 and are all compton - thick , with a typical mass @xmath17 and typical accretion time scale @xmath18myr , they might be excellent candidate sources of the fluctuations of the source - subtracted near infrared background ( nirb ) @xcite which is hard attributed to normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "as proposed in @xcite , dcbhs also naturally generate a cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) that is correlated with the nirb , which is observed by @xcite .",
    "the minimum lw intensity necessary to sustain the formation of the dcbh has been somewhat debated in recent literatures .",
    "early studies favored values as high as @xmath19 ( in units of @xmath20erg s@xmath21@xmath22hz@xmath21sr@xmath21 ) for a @xmath8  k blackbody spectrum , which represents a typical spectrum of pop ii stars ; and @xmath23 for a @xmath24  k blackbody spectrum , which characterizes metal - free stars @xcite . the critical intensity for the @xmath8",
    "k blackbody spectrum is lower because in this case , the main mechanism that quenches the @xmath13 formation is not to directly dissociate the @xmath13 themselves , but to dissociate the @xmath25 @xcite  the necessary intermediary for the @xmath13 formation  through the nir radiation above @xmath12  ev .",
    "however , a more detailed work by @xcite revised the value downward : e.g. for a @xmath8  k blackbody spectrum , it is @xmath26",
    ". the critical lw intensity could be even lower if a more refined treatment of self - shielding factor is implemented ( @xcite , z. haiman , personal communication ) .",
    "usually the probability for a halo to be embedded in a radiation field with super - critical lw intensity cooling is suppressed due to the direct dissociation of @xmath13 , or super - critical nir intensity which can be characterized by the intensity at lw band when the spectrum is already known  in case the @xmath27 dissociation plays the main role . ]",
    "is very small if normal galaxies and/or pop iii stars are the only sources of lw photons @xcite ; in this case dcbhs are very rare . however , @xcite pointed out that a compton - thick bh could be very luminous below 13.6 ev due to the reprocessed nebular emission .",
    "this means that , once the first dcbhs form , they could ignite a runaway process favoring the formation of more dcbhs and leading to a steep rise in the dcbh abundance ; we dub this well - defined period during cosmic evolution as the `` dcbh era '' , lasting for about 150 myr .",
    "the probability that a halo sees a lw intensity above the critical value can be calculated by monte carlo simulations @xcite , in which the lw radiation from previously formed dcbhs is explicitly taken into account . with this probability , and the probability of a halo being unpolluted , we get the formation rate of the dcbh and build the picture of the rise process of its abundance . the process comes to an end when the host atomic - cooling halos ( @xmath28  k ) are rapidly photoevaporated by ionizing photons .",
    "photoevaporation drastically reduces the dcbh formation rate and almost completely quenches their formation for @xmath29 .",

    "that easily prevents @xmath13 cooling by dissociating these molecules directly and eventually suppresses the formation of pop iii stars in minihalos ; while we include radiation from pop iii stars to calculate the lw feedback on the formation of pop iii stars themselves ( see sec .",
    "[ genetic ] ) , its role is irrelevant in triggering the formation of dcbhs due to requiring a very high lw critical intensity , as found by @xcite who explored a wide range of conditions .",
    "therefore we simply ignore the radiation from pop iii stars here .",
    "the spectrum of both normal galaxies and dcbhs is softer than the pop iii stars spectrum , the dissociation of @xmath27 by nir photons plays a significant role in this case , even we still use the radiation intensity at the lw band as a criterion , it should be understood as the effects of nir photons characterized by the lw intensity , as the spectrum is already known .",
    "regarding the lw luminosity of the dcbh , we use the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of compton - thick bhs derived in @xcite ( see the bottom panel of fig . 1 in that paper ) .",

    "we recall that the @xmath235 describes the formation probability of the dcbh in recently formed @xmath30 halos .",
    "let us start from the analysis of the fiducial model results .",
    "initially , all halos with mass @xmath30 are exposed to a lw intensity above @xmath46 , as at high redshift they represent rare , highly biased peaks of the density field ( dash - dotted line in fig . [ probabilities ] ) .",
    "however , dcbhs can hardly form in such systems as the neighboring galaxies providing the necessary lw illumination also eject metals , yielding @xmath236 and @xmath237 ( long and short - dashed lines , respectively ) . during cosmic evolution , these halos become less clustered and the metal enrichment probability by winds decreases considerably . as a result , at @xmath238",
    "@xmath57 starts to drop and @xmath58 starts to rise . at this time",
    "some dcbhs start to form in halos containing pristine gas ; once formed , they provide extra lw photons in addition to normal galaxies .",
    "as the universe keeps expanding , eventually @xmath56 also starts to drop ( @xmath239 ) at a high rate , because at this time the previously formed dcbhs are still too few to provide a sufficiently large number of lw photons . as a result , the @xmath58 reaches a peak of @xmath240 at @xmath239 , then it drops again , reaching the trough @xmath241 at @xmath242 .",
    "the combined probability @xmath235 closely traces the @xmath58 trend albeit with a much smaller value as the majority of halos ( 90% ) are polluted by metals from their progenitors ( solid line ) .",
    "note that since @xmath243 and until @xmath244 , the genetic enrichment is the dominant metal enrichment ( and dcbh suppression ) mode .",
    "a simple analogy will help understanding the physical evolution at this point .",
    "a dcbh can be visioned as a flame , with the newly formed pristine gas halos representing dry wood .",
    "if enough dry wood is provided the flame will grow stronger and dry more other wood by itself , reaching a kind of self - supported regime ; alternatively , the flame will rapidly extinguish due to the lack of fuel supply .",
    "the period @xmath245 represents a dangerous stage for the formation of dcbhs , as initially a large fraction of @xmath90 halos is already polluted , leaving only a minority of pristine ones as candidate hosts of new dcbhs . if the drop of @xmath56 would continue beyond that epoch , the initial dcbh `` weak flame '' would be extinguished or remain very weak .",
    "this would be the result if the lw radiation from dcbhs themselves is not considered .",
    "dcbhs are about two orders of magnitude brighter than most of normal galaxies in the lw band .",
    "thus , even if they are rare at high redshifts , they dramatically impact cosmic structure formation in several ways .",
    "the first obvious effect is that the formation probability of pop iii stars in minihalos is reduced significantly and even quenched after @xmath246 .",
    "therefore the genetic enrichment probability is reduced ( i.e. minihalos are sterilized ) and the fraction of @xmath30 halos with pristine gas increases . secondly ,",
    "lw radiation from previously formed dcbhs can trigger the formation of further dcbhs much more efficiently than normal galaxies .",
    "for example , at @xmath82 , the lw intensity of a normal galaxy in a host halo with mass @xmath30 drops to 30 at a distance @xmath247  kpc ( physical ) .",
    "the distance is only slightly larger than @xmath248 of the host halo , so it is only marginally possible for a single normal galaxy to trigger the formation of dcbhs at this redshift . on the other hand , for a bh with mass of @xmath131 ,",
    "the corresponding distance is about 7 kpc . at the same redshift , in the volume within this distance , during the accretion timescale of a bh , about 50 new halos with mass between @xmath30 and @xmath31 form .",
    "it means that a single bh can ideally prompt the formation of about 50 new dcbhs ! in practice , though , this number is likely smaller because at such high redshift many of these halos are metal - enriched when they form .",
    "whatever its precise strength is , this positive feedback exerted by dcbhs on their own formation can hardly be overlooked .",
    "the final results depend on the competition between the negative factors ( the expansion of the universe and metal pollution ) and the above positive feedback .",
    "if the latter dominates , the formation probability of the dcbh will rise again . at @xmath249 ,",
    "the abundance of dcbhs increases to a level that the trend of decreasing @xmath56 set by the negative factors can be reversed , @xmath56 and @xmath58 then start to rise , while around this time @xmath55 drops very fast .",
    "the rise of the dcbh population and the sharp decrease of the genetic enrichment are interlinked , of course .",
    "the universe then at @xmath250 enters the dcbh era , in which @xmath56 grows so rapidly due to positive feedback that essentially all newly formed , unpolluted @xmath30 halos become populated with active dcbhs , whose density reaches a peak of about @xmath251mpc@xmath4 at @xmath252 ( model @xmath232 in fig .",
    "[ rho_bhz ] , left panel ) .",
    "the dcbh era extends until @xmath9 , or about 150 myr .    what causes the end of the dcbh era ?",
    "the answer is _ photoevaporation _ , which represents a third negative feedback - in addition to cosmic expansion and metal enrichment - that sets in at later stages . to understand this key point let us inspect the upper panel of fig . [ jion ] , where we show the ionizing background intensity , @xmath210 , as seen by the most massive progenitors of two halos of mass @xmath253 and @xmath254 at @xmath255 , respectively .",
    "we mark @xmath209 on each curve .",
    "we also plot ( bottom panel ) the minimum mass of halos in which dcbhs could still form even under the effects of photoevaporation .",
    "photoevaporation feedback does not affect the formation of dcbhs before @xmath256 , when even halos with mass @xmath30 are massive enough to hold more than 20% of their gas ( long - dashed curve in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ jion ] ) .",
    "however , after then dcbhs could only form in halos with @xmath257 , which increases steadily since @xmath256 . for example , at @xmath9 @xmath51 is about 1.8 times @xmath30 .",
    "the number of newly formed halos with @xmath258 which can hold at least 20% of their gas is reduced by about 70% .",
    "as photoevaporation feedback becomes effective , the abundance of dcbhs decreases ( after a time delay @xmath259 ) steadily until a sharp drop occurs at @xmath9 , when even halos as massive as @xmath31 can not prevent their gas from being almost completely photoevaporated .",
    "we stress that the above scenario is largely independent of the upper mass limit of dcbh host halos .",
    "adopting a higher mass cut would make the dcbh disappearance phase slightly more gentle as a few among the most massive host halos are able to retain their gas .",
    "considering also the uncertainties in the details of our photoevaporation model , it is clear that the detailed late evolution of the dcbh abundance deserves additional future work .",

    "[ table : parameters ] ) to check the robustness of our conclusions .",
    "the evolution of mass density in these models is also plotted in fig . [ rho_bhz ] .",

    "[ rho_bhz ] we check the sensitivity of the results to the assumed minimum interhalo distance . as shown by fig .",

    "@xmath264 ignores the contribution from close neighbors within a certain distance by adopting a larger @xmath227 , and uses the minimum @xmath46 given in @xcite .",
    "we posit @xmath266 equal to 2 times the sum of the virial radii of two halos .",
    "the basic change with respect to the fiducial model is that both @xmath56 and @xmath57 are reduced by the larger @xmath227 .",
    "however , as metal enrichment by galactic winds is more sensitive to the distance between halos , at early stages @xmath58 is somewhat higher than in the fiducial model . an even larger @xmath227 value would fail to produce the dcbh population rise after @xmath267 ; if genetic enrichment is turned off , though , the rise can occur even for @xmath268 .",
    "we have studied the formation and evolution of dcbhs at high ( @xmath70 13 ) redshifts .",
    "the most striking result is that we found that a well - defined dcbh formation era might occur in the early universe extending approximately for 150 myr from @xmath250 to @xmath9 .",
    "the intermediate masses ( @xmath269 ) of dcbhs make them excellent seeds for the subsequent rapid growth of the smbh observed at @xmath70 6 .",
    "in addition , such bhs could be very abundant in this era and might leave a clear signature in the observed fluctuations of the source - subtracted nirb @xcite .    during such era",
    "the abundance of active dcbh grows , reaches a peak and eventually comes to a sudden halt when the required conditions for their formation disappear .",
    "these conditions include the availability of pristine gas in atomic - cooling halo ( @xmath28  k ) embedded in a sufficiently strong lw or nir radiation field .",
    "whether and for how long these conditions can be met during cosmic evolution depends on a complex network of negative and positive feedbacks that we have described in detail .",
    "a key result is that the ( so far neglected ) positive feedback of dcbh on their own formation fosters a rapid multiplication of the number of dcbhs .",
    "this is possible because dcbhs are likely compton - thick systems ( see @xcite ) , they are very bright in the rest - frame uv / nir band , typically outshining small high - redshift galaxies by more than 10 times ; in their surroundings the lw flux is therefore largely enhanced with respect to the level provided by galaxies , thus enabling additional dcbhs to form .",
    "dcbh formation spreads very rapidly , similarly to a flame in a haystack .",
    "their mass density raises from @xmath2  @xmath3mpc@xmath4 at @xmath270 to the peak value @xmath271  @xmath3mpc@xmath4 ( corresponding to a density parameter @xmath272 ) at @xmath7 in our fiducial model .",
    "the dcbh formation era however does not last very long .",
    "this is due to a combination of several negative feedback effects that we have discussed in sec .",
    "[ methods ] .",
    "in addition to the effect of a decreasing bias of dcbh host halos with time , metal pollution , either due to heavy elements inherited by the progenitor halos or carried by supernova winds coming from neighbors , is perhaps an obvious way to quench dcbh formation .",
    "however , we find that collectively these effects are not able to quench the dcbh widespread formation before @xmath273 . instead",
    ", the rapid dcbh birthrate drop is caused by photoevaporation of the gas from the gravitational well of the smallest atomic - cooling halos .",
    "this effect reduces the formation rate of the dcbh , almost completely suppressing their formation for @xmath29 .",
    "this is the reason why dcbh formation era lasts for a relatively short time interval during cosmic evolution .",
    "however , as they are compton - thick , their ionizing photons are fully reprocessed into lower energy radiation before escaping into the igm and , as such , they play no active role in driving reionization .",
    "the above scenario is robust against variations of the free parameters of the model , for which we have explored ( see sec .",
    "[ modvar ] ) , including the critical lw intensity threshold for dcbh formation , the strength of the genetic enrichment , and the influence of the assumed minimum distance between two halos . in spite of these",
    ", we do not observe substantial deviations from the evolutionary trend described by the fiducial case , witnessing a dcbh formation history firmly controlled by feedback(s ) action .",
    "our work is based on the most popular assumption that dcbh can only form under specific conditions , i.e. , the gas is metal - free and the @xmath13 formation is suppressed by strong external radiation .",
    "it is possible that even in the presence of metals or @xmath13 , if the accretion timescale is smaller than the fragmentation timescale , dcbh may still form @xcite ; particularly because the supersonic turbulence suppresses the fragmentation @xcite .",
    "albeit interesting , this scenario still needs to overcome a number of open questions that have been discussed in a recently published paper by two of the present authors @xcite",
    ". we can not exclude different dcbh formation channels with respect to the canonical one explored here , however , the photoevaporation of haloes with circular velocity 30  km / s , which is discussed in this paper , might in practice make these channels only have modest influence on our conclusions .",
    "we also note that purely forming dcbh in metal free , uv illuminated halos already produces a bh cosmic mass density comparable to the present - day one .",
    "we finally comment on a possibly intriguing implication of our model .",
    "the end of the dcbh era leaves behind a large number of `` fossil '' dcbh seeds ( @xmath274 ) . therefore to have sufficient number of seeds for smbhs",
    "is not a problem any more in this scenario ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "some of dcbhs are ready to be embedded in other galaxies and in smbhs .",
    "while only a small fraction of these bhs will continue to grow following merging events and possibly becoming smbhs , the majority of them will evolve passively .",
    "hence a large number of intermediate - mass black holes could be present in local universe , which has escaped so far detection . in the future it will be interesting to consider suitable strategies to find them .",
    "it is also tempting to speculate that dcbh gas  devoid , low - mass dark matter halo hosts might be related with the large missing halo population predicted by @xmath275cdm models at @xmath276 .",
