    "the apparent existence of metal - insulator transitions in two - dimensions @xcite has generated a lot of interest recently on the problem of interplay between interaction and disorder . however , the consequences of a highly non - trivial , non - gaussian distribution of conductances @xmath0 for even non - interacting electrons at arbitrary disorder at zero temperature in two or three dimensions remains poorly understood .",
    "in particular , several novel features in @xmath0 have recently been discovered @xcite , including a non - analyticity in @xmath0 near @xmath1 in the insulating regime @xcite , a ` one - sided ' log - normal distribution @xcite near the metal - insulator crossover regime in quasi one dimension ( q1d ) as well as strong deviations from the expected log - normal distribution for an anderson insulator @xcite in three dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "they raise serious questions about the effect of such broad asymmetric distributions on e.g. the anderson metal - insulator transition in particular and on quantum phase transitions @xcite in general .",
    "although there is a significant body of numerical work available @xcite , analytic study of the full distribution @xmath0 in 3d at arbitrary disorder is beyond the scope of the conventional field theory framework altshuler , shapiro .",
    "the novel features in @xmath0 mentioned above were obtained directly from the joint probability distribution @xmath2 of the @xmath3 transmission eigenvalues @xmath4 , @xmath5 , for an @xmath3-channel disordered conductor , via the landauer formula@xcite [ landauer ] p(g)_a^n dx_a p(*x * ) ( g-_i sech^2x_i ) .",

    "[ ] it was shown that at least two parameters are needed in order to guarantee the conservation of probability , so this can be considered as a minimalistic model . within this approximation ,",
    "disorder is characterized by @xmath18 . in the insulating regime",
    "one can interpret @xmath19 as the localization length , giving @xmath20 .",
    "the other independent parameter @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 depends only on the geometry of the system .",

    "we will obtain an analytic perturbative solution of the gdmpk equation for @xmath3 transmission channels valid in the strongly disordered regime @xmath29 .",
    "the solution is based on a mapping of the equation on to an imaginary time schrdinger equation @xcite , describing @xmath3 interacting bosons in one dimension evolving from a delta function initial condition and satisfying some singular boundary conditions . in ref .",

    "we include the interaction and show that it changes the qualitative features of the distribution .",
    "we begin by developing a systematic perturbation theory method to obtain the @xmath3-particle greens function . as a first check ,",
    "we show that our solutions agree where exact solutions are available , namely for the special cases of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "we then use the @xmath3-particle greens function to obtain the joint probability distribution of the eigenvalues @xmath31 , @xmath32 , analytically .",
    "we show that in particular , the density of the eigenvalues remains uniform , independent of disorder , with an exponential gap at the origin that increases with increasing disorder .",
    "indeed , it is this feature which is at the heart of many novel properties in the distribution of conductances in 3d .",
    "it suggests that the anderson metal to insulator transition can be viewed as the opening of a finite gap in the density of the eigenvalues at the origin .",
    "finally , we do the @xmath3-dimensional integral of eq .",
    "( [ pofg - def ] ) approximately to show that the distribution of conductance agrees with the numerical results , improving on the approximate solution obtained in ref .  [ ] where the distribution was found to be much broader . in particular , we obtain the variance @xmath33 as well as the skewness @xmath34 .",
    "we find that asymptotically the variance is not a simple power law although numerical data can be fitted with a power law in limited regimes .",
    "we also find that asymptotically the skewness goes as a positive constant .",
    "further , the skewness changes sign from positive to negative well before the metal - insulator transition point .",

    "\\ee therefore , we will be interested in the $ y\\to 0 $ limit of the $ n$-particle greens function $ g_n(\\textbf{x};t|\\textbf{y})$ as well . according to the construction of eq.~(\\ref{pofxyt } ) ,   $ p(\\textbf{x},t|\\textbf{y})$ looks highly singular in the limit $ y\\to 0 $ , given by      \\begin{eqnarray}\\label{singular }      p(\\textbf{x},t|\\textbf{y } ) & = &      \\frac{\\prod_{i < j}|\\sinh^2x_j-\\sinh^2x_i|^{\\frac{\\gamma}{2 } }       \\prod_i|\\sinh 2x_i|^{\\frac{1}{2 } } }      { \\prod_{i < j}|\\sinh^2y_j-\\sinh^2y_i|^{\\frac{\\gamma}{2 } }      \\prod_i|\\sinh2y_i|^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\cr      & \\times & g_n(\\textbf{x},t|\\textbf{y } ) .",

    "\\end{eqnarray } this marks a distinction between the $ g_n$ of eq.~(\\ref{prop } ) and more typical many - body green 's functions in that the expectation in this case is against the vacuum , rather than the many - body ground state .",
    "as we will see , this will have dramatic consequences for the diagrammatic expansion of $ g_n$.   now as usual we would like to go to the interaction picture , and so we define the interaction picture imaginary time evolution operator :      \\begin{eqnarray }      s(t_2 , t_1 ) = t\\exp \\left\\ { { - \\int\\limits_{t_1 } ^{t_2 } { dt'\\,h ' } ( t ' ) }   \\right\\ }      \\end{eqnarray } where $ h'$ is the perturbation in the interaction picture . taking advantage of the fact that $ h'$ annihilates the vacuum , and that t is always greater than 0 , we can write eq.~(\\ref{prop } ) as :      \\bea      g_n ( { \\bf{x}},t|{\\bf{y } } ) & = & \\frac{1}{{n!}}\\left\\langle { \\bf{0 } } \\right|ts(\\infty , 0)\\prod\\limits_{m = 1}^n { \\psi ( x_m      , t ) } \\cr      & \\times&\\prod\\limits_{n = 1}^n { \\psi ^\\dag   ( y_n , 0 ) } \\,\\left| { \\bf{0 } } \\right\\rangle       \\eea from the standard theory of non - equilibrium green 's functions , the diagrammatic expansion of $ g_n$ follows .",

    "\\subsection{simplification of the diagrammatic expansion }    the fact that the expectation is taken against the vacuum has a few important consequences for the diagrammatic expansion .",
    "first we will find that we have no self - energy corrections to $ g_0$.   this is because the self - energy is due to the interaction of the particle with the background state .",

    "\\subsection{exponential expansion }     we will find it most convenient to analyze the series expansion of the green 's function in terms of an exponential series ( defined below ) , rather than a taylor series .",
    "one reason is that we will find the individual diagrams in the taylor expansion diverge logarithmically ( for our potentials ) for small y.   yet when exponentiated , the diagrams will give logical , finite results .   additionally , we will need to extract from the taylor expansion the non - perturbative symmetry required in eq.~(\\ref{symmetry } ) , and this is perhaps most directly accomplished using the exponential series .",
    "to that end it is useful to consider the following .",
    "each diagram in the taylor expansion of $ g_n$ can be labelled according to the number of single particle potential lines on each particle , and the number of interaction lines between each pair of particles . for convenience",
    "we will then label each diagram , $ w$ , in the taylor expansion according to the following notation :      \\ [      \\\\w^{\\{u_i\\}}_{\\{v_j\\}}.      \\ ] the superscripts , $ \\{u_i\\}$ , label the number of external potential lines on each particle , $ i = 1 ... n$.",
    "the subscripts $ \\{v_j\\}$ label the number of interaction lines between each pair of particles $ j = 1 ... n(n-1)/2$.   for instance , the diagram in fig.\\ref{worder }       \\begin{figure }      \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=0.30\\textwidth]{worder.eps }      \\caption{typical diagram , w , in taylor expansion of $ g_n$ }      \\label{worder }      \\end{figure } would be labelled $ w^{211}_{102}$ since it has two u 's on particle 1 , one u on particle 2 , and one u on particle 3 , as well as one v between the first particle pair ( 12 ) , 0 v 's between the second particle pair ( 13 ) , and two v 's between the third particle pair ( 23 ) .",
    "other diagrams obtained by rearranging the potential lines on this diagram would be of the same order .   using this notation ,",
    "the taylor series expansion of the n - particle green 's function could be written as      \\begin{equation }      g_n   = g_n^{(0 ) } +   \\sum\\limits_{\\{u_i\\ }   = 0}^\\infty   \\sum\\limits_{\\{v_j\\ }   = 0}^\\infty     { w_{\\{v_j\\ } } ^{\\{u_i\\ } } }    \\label{tay - expansion}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the unperturbed n - particle green s function . in preparation for the next step",

    "we predict the skewness approaches a constant value in the deeply insulating regime , and changes sign as the disorder is decreased from deeply insulating regime towards the anderson transition point .",
    "our expression becomes less applicable as one approaches the transition , but the change in sign occurs well before the transition .",
    "the theory can in principle be improved by keeping higher order terms in the perturbation expansion , as shown in appendix a. however , even though the perturbation parameter remains small up to the anderson transition point , the partition function and hence the density of the eigenvalues can not be evaluated very accurately as the system approaches the transition .",
    "it is not clear at this point how to improve the calculation of the partition function beyond the mean field approximation used here .",
