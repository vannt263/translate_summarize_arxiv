    "electric field induced magnetization switching in multiferroic composites works according to the principles of converse magnetoelectric effect , i.e. , when an electric field is applied across the structure , it induces a magnetic anisotropy , which can rotate the magnetization .",
    "this eliminates the need to utilize the cumbersome magnetic field or high spin - polarized current to rotate the magnetization .",
    "@xcite hence , it can harness an energy - efficient binary switch replacing the traditional charge - based transistors for our future information processing systems .",
    "@xcite this turns out to be a very promising mechanism since a small voltage can generate a huge magnetic anisotropy , e.g. , with suitable choice of materials , when a voltage of few millivolts is applied across a strain - mediated multiferroic composite device ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : multiferroic_composite ] ) , i.e. , a magnetostrictive nanomagnet attached to a piezoelectric layer ,  @xcite the piezoelectric layer is strained and the generated strain is transferred to the magnetostrictive layer . then the induced stress anisotropy in the nanomagnet can switch the magnetization between its two stable states that store a binary information 0 or 1 .  @xcite .",
    "this study has opened up a new field named straintronics  @xcite and experimental efforts to realize such devices are considerably emerging .",
    "@xcite although the experimental efforts have demonstrated the induced stress anisotropy in the magnetostrictive nanomagnets , the direct experimental demonstration of switching delay ( rather than ferromagnetic resonance experiments  @xcite ) and utilizing low - thickness piezoelectric layers [ e.g. , @xmath2 100 nm of lead magnesium niobate - lead titanate ( pmn - pt )  @xcite ] for ultra - low energy dissipation are still under investigation .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]      the magnetostrictive nanomagnet is considered to be made of polycrystalline galfenol ( fega ) , which has the following material properties  magnetostrictive coefficient ( @xmath3 ) : + 150@xmath410@xmath5 , saturation magnetization ( @xmath6 ) : 8@xmath410@xmath7 a / m , young s modulus ( y ) : 140 gpa , and gilbert damping parameter ( @xmath8 ) : 0.025 .  @xcite the dimensions of the nanomagnet is 100 nm @xmath4 90 nm @xmath4 6 nm , which ensures that the nanomagnet has a single ferromagnetic domain .",
    "@xcite with the chosen dimensions , the stoner - wohlfarth switching field @xmath9 becomes @xmath0@xmath10 .",
    "the values of stress ( @xmath11 ) , strain ( @xmath12 ) , and asymmetric field ( @xmath13 ) are 60.6 mpa , 433@xmath410@xmath5 , and 0.01 t , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : distribution_energy_300k ] shows the distribution of energy dissipation at 300 k during the time interval @xmath14 = 100 ns , when stress is ramped up from zero to the maximum value , which makes the potential landscape monostable and erases the bit of stored information .",
    "this decreases the entropy of the system by @xmath15 .",
    "a concomitant amount of energy must be dissipated according to landauer s principle .",
    "stochastic violation of landauer s bound 0.6932@xmath16 due to thermal fluctuations is observed but the _ mean _ energy dissipation does respect the landauer s bound .",
    "this signifies the _ generalized _ landauer principle for _ small _ systems , which are prone to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the mean energy dissipation during the time interval @xmath17 ( when magnetization traverses from @xmath18 towards @xmath19 ) is 0.07@xmath16 , which does not have any bound since there is no entropy loss in the system .",
    "multiferroic straintronic devices turn out to be promising for energy - efficient computing in beyond moore s law era .",
    "since stress anisotropy in the magnetostrictive nanomagnets contribute a _ symmetric _ term , it is necessary to have an _ asymmetric _ component to maintain the direction of switching .",
    "intrinsic magnetization dynamics can contribute to such _",
    "asymmetric _ term . with realistic parameters ,",
    "the slight out - of - plane excursion of magnetization plays a crucial role in shaping the magnetization dynamics and therefore it is of paramount importance to consider complete three - dimensional potential landscape and solve full three - dimensional magnetization dynamics rather than _ assuming _ magnetization is always confined to magnet s plane . also intrinsic coupling between the polarization and magnetization",
    "can harness the _",
    "asymmetric _ term .",
    "these straintronic devices can be utilized not only for digital computing but also for analog signal processing .",
    "we have shown as well that the ultimate limit ( so - called landauer limit ) of energy dissipation is achievable in a magnetostrictive nanomagnet , linking information and thermodynamics .",
    "these findings would hopefully stimulate experimental efforts to demonstrate that the magnetostrictive nanomagnets are suitable for exploring the thermodynamic limit of energy dissipation .",
    "the miniscule energy dissipation in these straintronic devices can be the basis of ultra - low - energy computing for our future information processing systems .",
    "this can open up as well some unprecedented applications that need to work with the energy harvested from the environment e.g. , monitoring an epileptic patient s brain to notify an impending seizure by drawing energy solely from the patient s body .",
