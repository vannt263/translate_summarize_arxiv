    "we then repeated these observations using 2.5  ms time resolution , but with noise diode switching turned off to prevent data blanking . in both cases we employed position switching with reference points located 45  north of 3c  48 and 45south of 3c  84 .",
    "these positions are devoid of sources in the 1.4  ghz nrao vla sky survey @xcite and exhibit negligible - gradient background 408  mhz brightnesses within approximately 2% of the target position values .",

    "the absence of the noise diode signal required a non - standard calibration which we implemented in python based on the gbtidl procedures outlined by @xcite .",
    "only a few percent of the data in our frequency range of interest were found to be affected by rfi .",

    "we used equation  ( 2 ) from @xcite to calculate the time - averaged antenna temperature as a function of spectral channel , @xmath45 , for 3c  48 using the 1  s data . to calculate the antenna temperature as a function of time and channel for 3c  84 using the 2.5  ms data , @xmath46",

    "we then calculated @xmath50 and similarly @xmath51 for the reference position with sig replaced by ref .",
    "we confirmed this strategy by calculating equation  ( [ eqn : tant ] ) for 3c  48 using the 2.5  ms data .",
    "the result was consistent with the original @xmath52 derived from the 1  s data .",
    "the data for both linear polarizations were then averaged . corrected antenna temperatures were calibrated to the most recent 2012 flux density for 3c  48 from the @xcite standard .",
    "channels were averaged to form our two bands of interest . from these , we extracted 85  s of continuous sampling for 3c  84 .",
    "we calculate the noise in our data by integrating the power spectrum for each light curve between 100  hz and the 200  hz nyquist frequency , excluding lower temporal frequencies that are dominated by real signal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] presented shortly ) .",
    "the observed noise per sample is approximately 220  mjy  beam@xmath26 for the 8  mhz data and 66  mjy  beam@xmath26 for the 90  mhz data , consistent with theoretical predictions .",
    "we examined the 1  s reference position data for evidence of gain fluctuations in the receiver that would appear as flicker noise @xcite . if present , such fluctuations could potentially be misidentified as having a non - instrumental origin .",
    "we found no evidence for flicker noise above a temporal frequency of 0.07  hz .",
    "we found tentative evidence for increased spectral power below 0.07  hz .",
    "this temporal frequency is much lower than the timescales of interest in this work .",
    "additionally , our primary interest in this work regards the 2.5  ms data for which the thermal noise is greater . to avoid any possible confusion , in this work we only focus on temporal frequencies greater than 0.1  hz .",
    "the vla and gbt light curves of 3c  84 are displayed in fig .",
    "the mean flux densities of the 8  mhz and 90  mhz bandwidth data differ at each given epoch due to their slightly different central frequencies and the spectrum of 3c  84 .",
    "our data indicate that this spectrum is falling as a function of frequency ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "comparing between epochs , the mean flux densities of the gbt data are higher than the vla data , and there is a slight increase between the 2014 and 2015 vla data .",
    "the former difference is due to extended structure about 3c  84 to which our interferometric observations are insensitive ; 3c  84 is located within a @xmath53 halo at 1.4  ghz @xcite .",
    "the difference between the 2014 and 2015 epochs is caused by two factors .",
    "first , the 2015 data were obtained in c configuration , delivering increased sensitivity to the extended halo compared to the 2014 a configuration data .",
    "second , 15  ghz pointing calibration data from the very long baseline array ( vlba ) indicate that 3c  84 underwent a flare that peaked approximately 2014 july , with flux density at our 2015 epoch a few percent higher compared to the 2014 epoch .",
    "a third ( opposite ) contribution could arise from our adoption of a fixed 2012 flux density for 3c  48 .",
    "if the flux density of 3c  48 has continued to decline following the historical trend shown by @xcite , our flux densities for 3c  84 will be underestimated , though by no more than about 2% at the 2015 epoch .",

    "the difference between the gbt target and reference data at low frequencies indicates that the increased fourier power is real ( for clarity , only the 8  mhz reference data is shown in fig.s  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ; the 90  mhz reference data exhibit the same trends ) .",
    "the difference in power levels between the gbt target and reference 8  mhz data at high frequencies is consistent with increased noise due to the presence of the @xmath53 halo about 3c  84 ; the system temperature calculated at the reference position ( used for calibration ) is a factor 3 smaller than a similarly calculated system temperature at the position of 3c  84 .    the curves displayed in fig .",

    "the cause of this shift is likely the large coronal mass ejection cme52 that departed the sun at 2014 apr 8 23:12 utc in the direction of 3c  84 with median velocity 488  km  s@xmath26 and velocity range 230900  km  s@xmath26 , as reported in the cactus quicklook catalog for the lasco instrument onboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ . for reference ,",
