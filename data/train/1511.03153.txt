    "this paper concerns the reconstruction of a cloud surface from radiance satellite measurements . the state - of - the - art for extraction of physical properties of clouds from passive remote sensing",
    "is based on a pixel - by - pixel interpretation of the measured radiance across the solar spectrum , possibly at different angles and states of polarization .",
    "invariably , the cloud is modeled as a plane - parallel slab @xcite .",
    "this radical assumption about cloud geometry is more - or - less justified for stratiform clouds that have considerably more horizontal extension than thickness in the vertical . as important as these clouds are for the balance of the earth s climate , that leaves out many important types of clouds resulting typically from more vigorous convection ( updrafts)the cumulus class of cloud types . for such clouds ,",
    "the first order of business in remote sensing should be to reconstruct their non - trivial outer shape , hence the goal of the present demonstration .",
    "the main objective of the paper is to reconstruct such an interface as well as the light intensity emitted from it without modeling the internal optical properties of the cloud .    how light propagates inside the cloud is accurately modeled by a radiative transfer model @xcite .",
    "the plane - parallel slab geometry is attractive largely because it leads to one - dimensional radiative transfer that is considered to be a tractable problem in computational physics @xcite . as a demonstration that one can depart radically from the plan - parallel cloud geometry and",
    "still have an analytically tractable radiative transfer problem to solve , at least in the relevant diffusion approximation , davis @xcite assumed perfectly spherical clouds ; he then used his solution to derive effective optical thicknesses  or rather , diameters  for cumulus in a sparse field of broken clouds .",
    "reconstruction of the constitutive ( optical ) parameters in a full three - dimensional radiative transfer equation is a notoriously difficult and ill - posed problem @xcite that has rarely been attempted for real clouds . for computationally intense efforts in that direction during the past decade or so ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "far more efficient methods that may lead to practical implementations are currently being investigated @xcite .    in this paper , we do not aim to reconstruct such parameters and rather identify geometric properties of the cloud that are directly observable from satellite measurements and are independent from its optical properties .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a two - dimensional setting to simplify the modeling and the numerical simulations .",
    "we expect most results presented here to hold without major modification in a three dimensional environment .",
    "the cloud is modeled as a compact , connected , domain with a sufficiently smooth interface .",
    "the interface of the cloud is given by a curve parameterized by @xmath0 .",
    "since the reconstructions are local , the curve is also represented locally by a graph @xmath1 .",
    "the main objective is then to estimate @xmath2 from available data .",
    "to first order , the radiative transfer of light inside a cloud goes as follows .",
    "light is emitted from the sun , enters the cloud proper , scatters ( multiple times ) , and leaves the cloud at the points @xmath1 in all possible outgoing directions @xmath3 .",
    "importantly for the cloud shape reconstruction , cloud - escaping radiation is not isotropic ( a.k.a .",
    "lambertian ) .",
    "the measurements obtained by sensors mounted on satellites are modeled as the light intensity at position @xmath4 for all @xmath5 and a fixed @xmath6 ( the satellite s orbital altitude above the earth s surface ) .",
    "we assume that the sensors are equipped with several directional filters so that light intensity @xmath7 is measured for a discrete number of directions @xmath8 . typically , @xmath9 , as has been implemented for the multi - angle imaging spectro - radiometer ( misr ) @xcite .",
    "misr is part of the payload on nasa s terra satellite , which has a morning - crossing sun - synchronous orbit at @xmath6 = 705  km .",
    "misr s nine imaging sensors are `` push - broom '' cameras that use the orbital motion pitched at fixed angles ranging from about 70@xmath10 in the forward direction to the same in the backward direction .",
    "their common spatial sampling is 0.275  km .",
    "thus a typical cumulus cloud , which has commensurate horizontal and vertical dimensions of of a few km , will cover a few tens of pixels in the along - track direction .",
    "in the present study , we will assume many more spatial samples .",
    "this is more like what can be achieved using a digital camera located on the ground while the cloud is advected past it by a steady wind ( @xmath6 is then related to cloud height ) , or else by using an airborne platform ( @xmath6 is then related to the aircraft s altitude ) . there are space - based imagers that can achieve very high ( @xmath1110  m ) resolution , but they only have one view angle .",
    "therefore , only quite recently developed airborne imaging sensors have multi - angle capability @xcite .",
    "we will address the issues raised by the limited spatial sampling in current space - based imaging sensors in future work and , for the moment , we will continue to call the platform a `` satellite '' since satellites will eventually be the source of abundant free data for cloud shape reconstruction .",
    "let @xmath12 be the outward unit normal vector at @xmath1 , which is thus given by the proper normalization ( by @xmath13 ) of the vector @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the derivative of @xmath16 .",
    "the outward radiation at a point @xmath1 is therefore characterized by the intensity @xmath17 for all vectors @xmath3 such that @xmath18 .",
    "this is a two - dimensional function of @xmath19 whereas the available measurements correspond to @xmath20 one - dimensional functions .",
    "this results in a severely under - determined problem and assumptions on the outgoing radiation intensity are necessary . in this paper , we assume that the outgoing light intensity is of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are therefore functions of one variable . this physics - based model for light intensity",
    "is the correct one when light propagation in the cloud is modeled as a diffusive process @xcite .",
    "this situation holds for sufficiently opaque clouds , which are the ones for which a sharp separation between the inside and outside of the cloud is the most realistic .",
    "we are fully aware , as hypothesized in @xcite and proven observationally in @xcite that , due to the turbulent nature of their dynamics , cloud shapes are best represented as fractals , that is , as convoluted surfaces that do not have well - defined tangent planes nor normal vectors at any scale .",
    "consequently , our methodology proposes to deliver a smoothed or better yet , properly averaged , approximation of the cloud s actual outer three - dimensional shape .",
    "such smoothing is necessary in the context of limited available data and remains a vast improvement over the aforementioned operational assumption that clouds are plane - parallel optical media , regardless of image context .",
    "the main result of this paper is an iterative reconstruction procedure for @xmath24 when @xmath20 is sufficiently large based on a linearization of the functional mapping @xmath24 to the available satellite data . in `` favorable '' situations , which depend on the state about which the linearization is performed , this linear map is invertible and provides stable reconstructions for @xmath24 .",
    "explicit calculations allow us to display several such `` favorable '' as well as less - favorable situations .",
    "numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions .",
    "the outline for the rest of the paper is as follows . the graph model for the cloud interface and the associated inverse problems",
    "are presented in section [ sec : graph ] .",
    "the numerical algorithm used to solve the inverse problem is given in section [ sec : num ] . in section [ sec : speed ] , we show that the available measurements are not capable of uniquely reconstructing the parameters @xmath24 when the ( scalar - valued ) speed of the cloud is also unknown .",
    "finally , a more general geometric setting based on a polar representation of the cloud geometry is given in section [ sec : geom ] along with numerical simulations .",
    "a model of light scattering in the cloud , or different hypotheses on the structure of the outgoing radiation , are then necessary to uniquely reconstruct @xmath24 as well as the cloud speed .",
    "we present the geometric assumptions on the cloud in section [ sec : gs ] .",
    "the inverse problem is then linearized in section [ sec : lin ] and an iterative algorithm is described in section [ sec : nonlin ] .",
    "the calculations of section [ sec : lin ] are the main result of this paper and show under which conditions all or some of the parameters of interest @xmath24 can be reconstructed .",
    "we consider the setting of a two - dimensional bounded domain ( the cloud ) with boundary given by a curve parameterized by @xmath0 . to simplify the presentation , we focus in this section on the reconstruction of the  upper \" part of the cloud , which we assume",
    "is given by the graph of a function @xmath2 ; in other words , @xmath25 , with @xmath2 the unknown function we wish to reconstruct .",
    "since reconstructions will be shown to be local , an arbitrary boundary may be reconstructed by using the appropriate number of local graphs representing the interface ; see also fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the available measurements are assumed to be obtained by an imaging sensor at a fixed elevation @xmath6 ( we neglect surface curvature , which can be accounted for in a straightforward manner ) .",
    "measurements are performed along the line @xmath26 and for a given number of ( upward - pointing ) directions @xmath27 for @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 .",
    "a typical practical value is @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "most techniques for the reconstruction of strongly scattering optical media are based on the assumption that the equations of radiative transfer are valid to model the propagation of photons inside the medium .",
    "these models require to first reconstruct spatially varying functions such as the diffusion coefficient ( scattering mean free path ) and the absorption coefficient .",
    "such parameter estimations are often ill - posed .",
    "when satellite measurements are available for a large number of angles , we argue that the reconstruction of such parameters can be bypassed in some configurations , at least in a first stage .",
    "we propose an inversion procedure whose main objective is a direct reconstruction of @xmath2 .",
    "this requires some assumptions on the radiation emitted from the cloud that we now present in detail .",
    "let @xmath30 be the ( phase - space ) density of photons as a function of position @xmath31 and angle @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the medium between the cloud and the satellite is clear , so that photons advect freely : @xmath32 this implies that for all points @xmath33 outside of the cloud , we have @xmath34 for a point @xmath35 on the satellite line of measurements and for @xmath3 pointing  upwards \" , we denote by @xmath36 the distance from the satellite to the cloud in the direction @xmath3 and by @xmath37 the point of intersection on the surface of the cloud .",
    "these functions are defined via the constraints @xmath38 in our theoretical analyses , we assume that the functions @xmath39 and @xmath5 are uniquely defined and smooth and we set @xmath40 if the half - line from @xmath35 in direction @xmath3 does not intersect the cloud . for a fixed @xmath3 , we thus assume that the mapping @xmath41 is a local diffeomorphism .",
    "information from the satellite measurements thus provides knowledge of @xmath42 the outgoing radiation at the cloud surface is given by @xmath17 .",
    "it is not possible to reconstruct an arbitrary radiation profile @xmath17 from knowledge of @xmath43 since in fact we find a solution @xmath17 for each choice of @xmath2 .",
    "the outgoing radiation at the cloud surface thus needs to be constrained .    assuming that scattering ( disorder ) is large in the cloud (",
    "i.e. , the scattering mean free path is small compared to the overall extension of the cloud , as is often the case ) , then photon propagation inside the cloud is well - approximated by a diffusion equation . in that case , @xmath44 with @xmath45 being the solution of equations of the form @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this approximation breaks down at the surface of the cloud , where it needs to be replaced by the solution of a milne problem @xcite . at a point @xmath1 of the surface ,",
    "let @xmath48 be the outward unit normal vector to the surface .",
    "then we find the model @xmath49 with @xmath50 the solution of the diffusion approximation and @xmath23 an appropriate chandrasekhar function that depends on the scattering phase function inside the cloud @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath51 with @xmath52",
    ". therefore , @xmath53 .",
    "our constraint on the outgoing radiation of the cloud is to be consistent with the above diffusion approximation . in short , we assume that @xmath54 for two unknown functions : @xmath55 , a measure of the angularly integrated radiance escaping the cloud at point @xmath5 ; and @xmath56 , an angular distribution model that is assumed independent of position in the sense that it is function only of the angle of the observed radiance with the local normal . from",
    "we thus observe that @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 functionals of the unknown height function @xmath2 .",
    "note that multiplying @xmath22 by a constant and dividing @xmath60 by the same constant does not change @xmath61 .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath62 is normalized , for instance by assuming that it integrates to @xmath63 or that the value for a fixed @xmath64 is known .    in our setting",
    ", we thus have a measurement operator @xmath65 the inverse problem consists of reconstructing @xmath66 from knowledge of @xmath67 for a fixed value of @xmath6 , for @xmath68 on a line segment , and for @xmath69 .",
    "let us define @xmath70 .",
    "the above measurement operator @xmath71 , a nonlinear functional of @xmath72 , does not seem to have an explicit inversion formula .",
    "following a standard methodology , we linearize the problem about a reference configuration @xmath73 and obtain an equation for the linear update @xmath74 from knowledge of @xmath75 .",
    "this section presents the main results of the paper , namely equation providing the relationship between the unknown @xmath76 and the known measurement @xmath77 .",
    "recall : @xmath78 we wish to differentiate this expression with respect to @xmath66 .",
    "while the derivatives with respect to @xmath22 and @xmath60 are straightforward , the differentiation with respect to @xmath16 requires a few additional steps .",
    "since the graph @xmath79 is assumed to be known in the linearization procedure , we define @xmath80 and @xmath81 as the solutions to with @xmath16 replaced by @xmath82 .",
    "let @xmath83 and @xmath84 be the linearizations of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "we use the notation @xmath87 for @xmath88 and identify @xmath89 recalling that @xmath90 .",
    "let us introduce @xmath91 . differentiating the above expression for @xmath92",
    ", we find to leading order that @xmath93    it remains to express @xmath84 in terms of @xmath94 . from",
    ", we find up to second - order that @xmath95 we thus deduce that @xmath96 then , from the above expressions for @xmath77 and @xmath84 , we obtain that @xmath97 recalling that @xmath91 .",
    "the above expression is the main calculation of the paper .",
    "our objective is to reconstruct two spatially dependent functions @xmath98 and @xmath99 and one angularly dependent function @xmath100 from the spatially and angularly dependent function @xmath101 .",
    "counting dimensions shows that the problem is formally over - determined as soon as measurements are available for @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "however , rewriting the above equation as @xmath104 , and in normal form @xmath105 with @xmath106 the adjoint operator to @xmath107 , the linear operator @xmath108 needs to be invertible .",
    "this imposes some conditions on @xmath73 , which are not always met in practice .",
    "the subsequent sections present situations in which we can prove that @xmath108 is indeed invertible provided that adapted boundary conditions ( for instance dirichlet conditions for @xmath2 ) are imposed .      as recalled earlier , we assume that the map @xmath109 for each fixed @xmath3 is a smooth change of variables .",
    "we easily verify that such is the case when @xmath110 is sufficiently small .",
    "then the map @xmath111 is also a smooth invertible change of variables .",
    "we then identify functions @xmath112 and @xmath113 with @xmath114 and use this convenient change of notation .",
    "let us consider that @xmath101 is available for a continuum of values of @xmath64 to simplify the analysis .",
    "dividing by @xmath115 , we may recast it as @xmath116 with @xmath117 up to lower - order terms , and with @xmath118 and @xmath119 coming explicitly from .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath120 depends on the independence of the functions @xmath121 appearing in the system .",
    "let us consider first the simplest setting with @xmath122 ( as a simple model for limb - darkening ) and @xmath123 ( flat horizontal cloud boundary ) .",
    "we verify that @xmath124 in other words , we have @xmath125 if we normalize @xmath126 , then we observe that the above expression at @xmath127 ( nadir view ) provides @xmath128 , or equivalently @xmath129 .",
    "it is then straightforward to observe that @xmath130 is known up to the addition of @xmath131 for @xmath132 arbitrary , and that @xmath133 is known up to the addition of the constant @xmath134 .",

    "then all parameters are uniquely determined provided that , for instance , @xmath136 and @xmath137 are known .",

    "consider a more general case with still @xmath141 but @xmath142 arbitrary so that @xmath143 let us assume that @xmath144 are linearly independent functions .",
    "then as before , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 are reconstructed with the constants @xmath148 still unknown , while @xmath149 is also reconstructed .    in favorable situations",
    ", we need to impose less conditions than when @xmath150 .",
    "indeed , assume that @xmath151 ( because @xmath136 is known ) .",
    "if @xmath152 , then @xmath153 is known and we have an expression for @xmath154 . this provides an expression for @xmath155 .",
    "the normalization of @xmath156 then allows us to reconstruct @xmath157 .    the general case with @xmath158 proceeds as above",
    ": we need to impose one or two conditions on @xmath94 depending on whether @xmath121 are linearly independent or not .",
    "the above analysis shows that @xmath159 can be uniquely reconstructed with minimal additional information required on @xmath94 .",
    "let us conclude this section by considering the case where @xmath62 is known , for instance chosen as @xmath160 with @xmath23 the chandrasekhar function corresponding to the appropriate scattering phase function inside the cloud . then in the setting with",
    "@xmath161 and @xmath162 linearly dependent , we obtain a unique reconstruction of @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "this provides a reconstruction of @xmath94 if for instance @xmath151 .",
    "if @xmath161 and @xmath162 linearly independent , then @xmath165 and @xmath166 can both be reconstructed and @xmath94 is then uniquely determined provided that @xmath167 does not vanish uniformly .",
    "thus in practice , we expect to uniquely reconstruct @xmath168 from the available satellite measurements .",
    "let us assume that the nonlinear operator @xmath108 as defined above is invertible",
    ". then it will be invertible for nearby values of @xmath169 by continuity .",
    "we may then set up the following newton inversion for the nonlinear problem .",
    "let us assume that @xmath170 has been reconstructed and define @xmath171 as the linearization of @xmath71 in the vicinity of @xmath172 .",
    "then up to second - order we have @xmath173 we thus define the iterative algorithm @xmath174 provided that the initial guess @xmath169 is sufficiently close to @xmath72 and that @xmath108 is invertible , then it is a classical result that @xmath175 is also invertible and @xmath172 converges to @xmath72 as @xmath176 .    as we have seen in the preceding section",
    ", the matrix @xmath108 may not be invertible or may be ill conditioned ; for instance when @xmath177 and @xmath178 , which imposes that @xmath179 in . to remedy this issue , we add a small penalty term and solve instead @xmath180 with @xmath181 a linear operator that penalizes the curvature of @xmath16 , for instance , @xmath181 can be a discretization of @xmath182 ; see @xcite for references on regularization .",
    "we then choose @xmath134 small in order not to affect the reconstruction of @xmath16 when the curvature does not vanish .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that nonlinear problems may be injective even when their linearizations are not ( think of the map @xmath183 whose linearization is not invertible at @xmath184 ) . however , when @xmath185 and @xmath186 are constant , then the available measurements @xmath71 are independent of @xmath82 .",
    "the upper boundary of the cloud can indeed be represented as a graph @xmath1 for a large class of clouds .",
    "however , the lateral and bottom boundaries would require different parameterizations . in order to avoid technical difficulties ,",
    "we have considered clouds with the following ( simplified and somewhat unrealistic ) structure .",
    "we assume that the bottom of the cloud is flat and given by the line segment between @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",

    "then we observe , changing to @xmath266 to @xmath267 variables , that @xmath268 then as in the preceding section , we observe that @xmath269 can be reconstructed under appropriate assumptions on @xmath94 . without prior information on @xmath163 ,",
    "it is impossible to separate @xmath163 from @xmath270 .    in the simplified case where @xmath158 and @xmath271 so that @xmath272 , and considering only the part involving @xmath273 and @xmath264 , we find @xmath274 the functions @xmath275 are then linearly independent as soon as @xmath276 . in such a setting , @xmath264 and @xmath163 can be separately reconstructed , as well as @xmath94 and @xmath277 under conditions on @xmath94 similar to those obtained in earlier sections .",
    "this shows that in spite of what looks like redundant measurements ( @xmath112 known for all @xmath68 and @xmath64 ) , the reconstruction of the additional scalar coefficient @xmath264 is not guaranteed in general . the nonlinear problem for @xmath253",
    "is then handled as described earlier .",
    "that all coefficients in @xmath253 can not be reconstructed has been confirmed in numerical experiments , where we were not able to obtain any converging algorithm .",
    "the simulations , carried out for values of @xmath134 in the range 0.7 to 0.9 , are not presented here .",
    "simultaneous reconstruction of the cloud s shape and speed requires a different modeling of the optical parameters of the cloud .",
    "this is the subject of ongoing research .    to motivate this future work",
    ", we note that horizontal cloud velocity is successfully retrieved at the same time as cloud ( top ) height using multi - angle imagery with 275  m resolution from the previously mentioned misr instrument on nasa s terra satellite @xcite . in that case",
    ", @xmath134 is very nearly unity since @xmath244 is an orbital velocity ( @xmath117  km / s ) while @xmath243 is @xmath117  m / s .",
    "apart from high - accuracy geolocation , the main requirement is to locate the same cloud or cloud feature as seen by different misr cameras using standard feature matching methods @xcite , as is done routinely for cloud height estimation by stereography @xcite .",
    "a minimum of three cameras is required to unravel cloud height and the along - track component of the wind .",
    "the constructions presented above assume that the cloud surface is represented by a graph @xmath1 . clouds with a closed boundary thus can not be reconstructed by such a method unless several charts are considered .",
    "several modifications of the theory allow us to reconstruct clouds with closed boundary .",
    "the simplest method is arguably to assume that the boundary can be represented as a graph in polar coordinates @xmath278 .",
    "the measurements are now performed on a circle of radius @xmath279 that shares the same origin with the cloud , where @xmath280 is fixed and known .",
    "again , we assume that we receive measurements for @xmath102 and that @xmath103 . for an earth science application",
    ", one can envision an aircraft carrying an imager that circumnavigates an opaque cloud of interest ; this `` cloud '' could equally well be an opaque aerosol plume emanating from a powerful source ( e.g. , ash from an erupting volcano , smoke from a massive wildfire ) .",
    "let @xmath281 be the density of photons as a function of position @xmath282 and angle @xmath64 .",
    "assuming the same conditions as in previous section , we have @xmath283 where @xmath284 is some position on the circle where we receive measurements .",
    "let @xmath285 be the slope of the tangent line at a point @xmath286 of the surface , and let @xmath287 be the outward unit normal vector to the surface .",
    "then as before , we assume that @xmath288 for two unknown functions @xmath289 and @xmath62 .",
    "from above we thus observe that , @xmath290 where we still assume that @xmath62 is normalized .    in this setting , we thus have measurement operator @xmath291 the inverse problem consists of reconstructing @xmath292 from knowledge of @xmath293 .",
    "let us represent the cloud boundary by a graph @xmath282 for @xmath294 , which we assume to be piecewise linear .",
    "for @xmath295 , we have @xmath296 and @xmath297 .    the radiance at each of the @xmath298 linear pieces of the cloud is denoted by @xmath198 for @xmath299 .",
    "the function @xmath60 is discretized in the same way as previously .    with this geometry for the cloud , it remains to construct a discretization of the forward map @xmath300 .",
    "we assume measurements available for @xmath301 and discretize the measurement circle of radius @xmath279 by @xmath302 for a discretization step @xmath303 and number @xmath304 .",
    "we denote @xmath210 as @xmath305 here because the bigger the radius the finer we have to discretize in order to get a reasonably smooth measurement .",
    "the value @xmath207 is then the integral of the real solution @xmath306 generated by the discretized cloud averaged over the arc @xmath307 .",
    "we verify that @xmath207 is non - zero for a finite number of values @xmath210 .",
    "the above procedure defines a continuous functional from @xmath308 to @xmath207 .",
    "the functional can be linearized similarly as explained in the derivation of and the solution of the corresponding nonlinear inverse problem is similar to what has been explained in section [ sec : nonlin ] .",
    "we now show some numerical simulations generated from the model we just described . in our settings , we chose @xmath309 to be the origin of our cloud and of the disk of radius @xmath279 from which we receive measurements . in our examples , we used not only arbitrary functions for @xmath22 , but also the more realsitic one in that mimics solar illumination . in the following figures ,",
    "we continue to use three colors , blue , red and black to represent the truth , the reconstruction and the initial guess , respectively .",
    "our initial guess for @xmath22 is always a constant function @xmath310 . in all cases",
    ", the figures would be displayed with @xmath311 on the left and @xmath289 on the right .",
    "the function @xmath60 is still as in fig.[fig : beta ] . the value of @xmath312 ( so that @xmath313 ) and the number of measurement directions is @xmath314 .",
    "the angles are given explicitly by the arccos value of @xmath315 .",
    "* example 1 * : a smooth reconstruction of @xmath311 and @xmath289 :         in this example , we obtain excellent reconstructions of both @xmath311 and @xmath289 .    * example 2 * : @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath22 given in .         in this example",
    ", the reconstructions for both @xmath311 and @xmath289 are good except in the vicinity of the two points highlighted in green and black boxes in both figures ( upper middle to the right ) .",
    "note that we have mentioned earlier that the reconstruction would break down when @xmath316 and @xmath317 , where @xmath1 represents a cartesian representation of the cloud surface in an appropriate system of coordinates .",
    "we could see clearly that some point between the highlighted points is precisely where @xmath316 and @xmath317 .",
    "the reconstruction would have been worse had we not added the small penalty term that was described earlier in section [ sec : nonlin ] . * example 3 * : @xmath318 , @xmath241 and @xmath22 given in ( a well - reconstructed profile )         in this configuration ,",
    "all hypotheses necessary for a good reconstruction are met .",
    "* example 4 * : in this case , @xmath22 is chosen to be a step function         in this example , we gave more curvature to the cloud and again the reconstructions were good for most of the parts except in the vicinities of the points highlighted in green and black boxes , which were highlighted in both figures ( lower to the right ) .",
    "we can see clearly that the reconstruction broke down for the same reason as in example 2 .",
    "this paper presents reconstruction procedures for the geometry of a cloud from airborne or satellite observations at @xmath319 viewing angles and at quite high spatial resolution ( on the order of 100s of pixels across the cloud ) . rather than reconstructing the optical properties of cloud , which may vary in space , we focus here on a robust reconstruction of the geometry of the cloud without modeling light scattering .    in the simplified setting of a two - dimensional cloud with known speed we showed that the three one - dimensional functions @xmath320 ( or equivalently @xmath321 ; see )",
    "could all be reconstructed from satellite measurements when @xmath20 is sufficiently large in favorable situations where the linearized map is invertible .",
    "this was confirmed by several numerical solutions showing that our iterative procedure converged in many settings . however , there are situations where such a map is not invertible .",
    "specifically , convergence problems arise when the cloud s boundary lacks curvature and/or the angular distribution of light emerging from the cloud is nearly isotropic .",
    "more surprising , we found that the speed of the cloud , when unknown , could not always be uniquely recovered from the available measurements .",
    "this finding immediately motivates further research since cloud - based wind speeds are routinely retrieved from multi - angle imaging sensors in space with far lower spatial resolution than assumed here ( on the order of 10s of pixels across the cloud , or less ) . on the other hand , no attempt is made yet with these sensors to retrieve cloud shape , only their height in some spatially - averaged sense .",
    "we expect many results to hold in a three - dimensional environment .",
    "the main new feature is that the now three - dimensional normal vector @xmath12 is no longer in the plane given by the satellite trajectory and measured directions @xmath232 , which would slightly modify the form of the linearized operator mapping @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "the main result of the paper is to show that geometric features of the cloud could be reconstructed from satellite measurements without having to estimate the radiative transfer parameters inside a cloud . in some configurations ,",
    "for instance when the cloud speed is unknown , this procedure may have too strong limitations .",
    "in such a case , a parameterization of the optical properties of the cloud becomes necessary .",
    "the resulting inverse problem for @xmath320 and such optical properties is the object of current research .",
