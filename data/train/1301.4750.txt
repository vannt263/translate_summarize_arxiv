    "additionally , the hydride cages are more distorted in the mgh@xmath0 structure with the smallest face which surrounds an mg@xmath5 being the one which links one magnesium cation to another . actually , the structure can also be viewed as sheets of mgh@xmath3 with h@xmath3  molecules trapped in the larger gaps between the sheets , one such sheet is shown at the right of fig .
