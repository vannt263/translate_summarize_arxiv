    "psr j0108@xmath01431 was discovered by tauris et al .",
    "( 1994 ) during the parkes southern pulsar survey . with a period @xmath1 s and a period derivative @xmath2 s  s@xmath3 ( damico et al .",
    "1998 ) , the pulsar has a characteristic age @xmath4 myr , rotation energy loss rate @xmath5 erg s@xmath3 , and magnetic field @xmath6 g. from the taylor & cordes model ( 1993 ) , the low dispersion measure ( @xmath7 @xmath8  pc ) puts psr j0108@xmath01431 at a distance of 60 - 130 pc .",
    "although very close , psr j0108 - 1431 has never been detected so far outside the radio band .",
    "virtually undetectable according to standard cooling models , which predict a temperature @xmath9 k for an age of @xmath10 170 myr ( tsuruta 1998 ) , the detection of optical - uv thermal radiation from the neutron star ( ns ) surface would allow one to constrain possible heating mechanisms like the dissipation of energy of differential rotation ( e.g. van riper et al .",
    "1994 ) and joule heating caused by dissipation of the magnetic field in the ns crust ( miralles , urpin & konenkov 1998 ) .",
    "thus , if some heating mechanisms indeed operate , one can expect the surface ns temperature of a few times @xmath11  k , detectable in the optical - uv but undetectable in x - rays .",
    "optical observations of psr j0108 - 1431 were carried out with the 6-m telescope of special astrophysical observatory ( russia ) , but they were not deep enough to detect the pulsar ( kurt et al.2000 ) .",
    "therefore , we performed a deep observation with the antu unit of the eso very large telescopes ( vlt ) between july and august 2000 .",
    "images were obtained in the bessel filters @xmath12 ( 9000s ) , @xmath13 ( 5400s ) , and @xmath14 ( 7200s ) using the focal reducer and spectrograph 1 ( fors1 ) instrument operated at its standard angular resolution of 0.2  per pixel , with a corresponding field of view of @xmath15 . see mignani , manchester and pavlov ( 2003 ) for details on the observations and the data reduction . to obtain an updated reference radio position of the pulsar",
    ", we performed new observations with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) on 2001 march 31 in two bands centered on 1384 mhz and 2496 mhz .",
    "we derived a mean position ( epoch 2001.3 ) of @xmath16=@xmath17 , @xmath18=@xmath19 , coincident within the uncertainties with that obtained from the timing data ( damico et al.1998 ) .",
    "this implies an upper limit on the pulsar proper motion of 82  mas  yr@xmath3 , corresponding to a total velocity @xmath20 km s@xmath3 ( with @xmath21 being the pulsar distance in units of 130 pc ) i.e. within the bottom 10% of the measured pulsar velocity distribution ( lorimer , bailes and harrison 1997 ) . by using as a reference",
    "the positions of stars selected from the gsc ii , the most recent pulsar position was finally registered on the fors1 images ( overall accuracy @xmath22 in r.a . and",
    "@xmath23 in dec ) .",
    "the pulsar position at the epoch of our optical observations is marked in fig.1 ( left ) . to facilitate the object detection , all the images",
    "have been smoothed using a gaussian filter .",
    "the pulsar position falls about @xmath24 east from an elliptical galaxy in the field .",
    "since such a distance corresponds to about twice the uncertainty of the pulsar position in r.a , it is unlikely that the pulsar is hidden behind the galaxy , but we can not rule it out .",
    "only few point - like objects ( labelled in fig.1 , left ) have been detected within a radius of @xmath25 from the pulsar position but they are too distant from the nominal pulsar position to be considered candidate counterparts .",
    "therefore , we conclude that no optical counterpart to the pulsar can be identified in our data down to @xmath26 upper limits of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 e.g. more than 3 magnitudes deeper than those obtained by kurt et al.(2000 ) . for a distance of 130 pc , estimated from the pulsar s dispersion measure ,",

    "1994 ) and confirmed by asca ( wang and halpern 1997 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum could be either thermal ( @xmath37 ) and produced from hot polar caps ( yancopulous et al .",
    "1994 ; wang and halpern 1997 ) or non - thermal with a spectral index @xmath38 ( becker and trmper 1997 ) . a candidate optical counterpart was identified with the hst / foc by pavlov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) from the positional coincidence with the radio coordinates . to secure the identification of the psr b1929 + 10 optical counterpart",
    "we have applied the strategy used by mignani et al.(2000 ) , i.e. , the measure of a proper motion consistent with the radio one .",
    "the field of psr b1929 + 10 was imaged with the hst / stis between august and october 2001 .",
    "ten 1200s exposures were obtained over five visits with the nuv - mama detector ( @xmath39 field of view , @xmath40 pixel size ) through the f25qtz filter ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the stis time - integrated images were calibrated using the standard hst pipeline and corrected for the ccd geometric distortion . as starting point for our proper motion measurement we used the foc observations of pavlov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , retrieved from the st - ecf public archive and recalibrated on - the - fly .",
    "a complete description of the relative astrometry procedure with a detailed discussion of the error budget is reported in mignani et al.(2002 ) .",
    "after the registration of the different epoch images in a unique reference frame , we could measure the candidate optical counterpart displacement over the 7.2 years ( fig.2 , left ) .",
    "the five independent measurements yielded results fully consistent within the errors . by means of a simple @xmath42 fit we obtained the best proper motion values : @xmath43 mas  yr@xmath3 @xmath44 mas  yr@xmath3 corresponding to a position angle ( pa ) of 64.63@xmath45 @xmath46 0.55@xmath45 . within the errors ,",
    "these results are fully compatible in both magnitude and direction with the radio ones ( brisken et al .",
    "2002 ) : @xmath47 mas  yr@xmath3 @xmath48 mas  yr@xmath3 ( pa=65.58@xmath45 @xmath46 0.09@xmath45 ) .",
    "our proper motion measurement thus provide a robust proof that the candidate proposed by pavlov et al.(1996 ) is indeed the optical counterpart of psr b1929 + 10 .",
    "the stis / f25qtz flux of the pulsar has been compared with the photometry of pavlov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in the f130lp ( @xmath49 ) and f342w ( @xmath50 ) filters . at a variance with middle - aged ( @xmath10 @xmath51 yrs ) pulsars such as psr b0656 + 14 , psr b1055 - 52 and geminga , for which the optical fluxes are somewhat compatible with the extrapolations of their x - ray spectra , the flux of the psr 1929 + 10 candidate counterpart deviates by about 3 orders of magnitude from the predicted values ( fig.2 , right ) . in addition , the data seems to be consistent with a power law , with spectral index @xmath52 , depending on the actual value of the reddening .",
    "this result is apparently in contrast with the available data from young to middle - aged pulsars which suggest , as a general trend , a decreasing importance of non - thermal processes with the age .",
    "a compact ( @xmath53 ) x - ray nebula around the vela pulsar was detected in soft x - rays with the _ einstein _ hri ( harnden et al . 1985 ) and firstly interpreted as a pulsar - wind nebula ( pwn ) powered by relativistic particles ejected by the pulsar , which shock in the ambient medium and emit synchrotron radiation . based on its `` kidney - bean '' shape ,",
    "markwardt & gelman ( 1998 ) proposed an interpretation in terms of a bow - shock produced by the supersonic motion of the pulsar through the ambient medium .",
    "the vela pulsar and its pwn have been recently observed with both the high resolution camera ( hrc ) and the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory .",
    "thanks to the excellent angular resolution of _ chandra _ , the morphology of the pwn was resolved in a complex structure , similar to that of the crab pwn , which can not be explained by a simple bow - shock model .",
    "the brighter part of the pwn ( @xmath54 ) , shows an approximately axisymmetric structure , with two arcs , a jet , and a counter - jet , embedded into an extended diffuse emission .",
    "the axis of symmetry , which can be associated with the pulsar rotational axis , nearly coincides with the direction of the pulsar s proper motion ( p.a .",
    "= 301@xmath45  e.g. , caraveo et al .",
    "the inner pwn is then surrounded by a bean - shaped diffuse nebula ( @xmath55 ) with an elongated region of fainter diffuse emission southwest of the brighter part of the pwn and detected up to @xmath53 from the pulsar .",
    "a @xmath56-long outer jet is also seen northwest of the inner pwn .",
    "the overall spectrum of the pwn can be described by a power law with an average spectral ( energy ) index @xmath57 , which can be interpreted as synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons and/or positrons .",
    "such a spectrum is expected to extend to optical and radio frequencies . although the radio emission from the compact nebula is probably dominated by the brightness of the pulsar , highly polarized ( up to 60% at 5 ghz ) extended ( @xmath58 ) radio emission has been indeed detected in the surrounding region ( lewis et al .",
    "2002 ; r.  dodson 2002 , private communication ) with two radio lobes southeast ( @xmath59 arcmin@xmath60 ) and northeast ( @xmath61 arcmin@xmath60 ) wrt the pulsar .",
    "one can then expect the presence of an optical nebula around the vela pulsar , as observed in several other young pulsars like the crab pwn ( see , e.g. , hester et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) and psr b054069 ( caraveo et al .",

    "see table 1 for a detailed summary of the optical observations . for a direct compararison , optical and x - ray images have been superimposed with respect to the absolute ( @xmath63,@xmath64 ) reference frame , relying on the astrometric solution of each image .",
    "the absolute frame registration between the optical and x - ray images turned out to be accurate within @xmath65@xmath66 , comparable with the uncertainty in the absolute astrometry of each frame .",
    "our starting point was the combined wfpc2 f555w image , which is by far the deepest optical image of the vela pulsar field .",
    "the final image is shown in fig .",

    "the point source within the innermost x - ray contour is the optical counterpart of the vela pulsar .",
    "the central pc field is large enough to map the inner part of the x - ray pwn , i.e. , the inner arc , the jet and the counter - jet , easily identifiable in the contour map .",
    "unfortunately , the outer arc region is partially coincident with the ccd gaps between the pc and wfc chips .",
    "no optical counterparts of the known x - ray features can be identified in the combined wfpc2/555w image , nor any other structure symmetric to the pulsar proper motion direction ( fig.3 - left ) .",
    "we set 3@xmath67 upper limits of 27.4 mag arcsec@xmath68 ( 0.39 @xmath69 ergs cm@xmath68 s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 arcsec@xmath68 ) and 27.1 mag arcsec@xmath68 ( 0.57 @xmath71 ergs cm@xmath68 s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 arcsec@xmath68 ) for the innermost region ( inner arc , jet , and counter - jet ) and the outer arc , respectively .",
    "after correcting for interstellar extinction , these values translate to @xmath72 mag arcsec@xmath68 ( 0.52 @xmath73 ergs cm@xmath68 s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 arcsec@xmath68 ) and @xmath74 mag arcsec@xmath68 ( 0.57 @xmath69 ergs cm@xmath68 s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 arcsec@xmath68 ) , respectively .",
    "the analysis was repeated for the rest of the optical database , but no evidence for a compact optical nebula was found .",
    "we used the wider _ ntt _ images to search for diffuse optical emission up to distances of @xmath75 arcmin , in particular at the position of the southwest extension of the x - ray nebula .",
    "although many background enhancements can be recognized in the combined _ ntt _ @xmath76 image ( fig.3 - right ) , they can be also identified in the eso/2.2 m h@xmath77 one , suggesting that they are most likely associated with the bright filaments of the vela supernova remnant .",
    "we thus put upper limits on the extended emission of 25.4 mag arcsec@xmath68 ( 2.5 @xmath71 ergs cm@xmath68 s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 arcsec@xmath68 ) .",
    "we have compared the measured optical upper limits on the brightness of the vela pwn for the outer arc and the diffuse emission southwest of the pulsar with the extrapolation of the x - ray and radio data . while the optical upper limits for the inner / outer arcs are close to such extrapolation , in the case of the southwest diffuse emission they lie about 3 orders of magnitudes above the expected value ( mignani et al .",
    "2003 ) . to summarize ,",
    "we conclude that it is very likely that just a slightly deeper optical observation would allow one to detect the outer / inner arc ( and other bright elements of the inner pwn ) , while even deeper optical observations are needed to detect the emission from the vela pwn at large .",
