    "weak polyelectrolytes are polymers with ionizable functional groups that partially dissociate in polar solvents leaving ions of one sign bound to the polymer chain and oppositely charged counterions in solution @xcite . in contrast to strong polyelectrolytes which dissociate completely in the entire ph range accessible experimentally , weak polyelectrolytes carry weak acidic or basic functional groups whose degree of ionization can be controlled by the change in the solution ph @xcite .",
    "the conformational behaviour of weak polyelectrolytes can thus be finely tuned by changes in the solution ph , ionic strength , solvent quality and temperature rendering them with properties which find applications in many areas including gene delivery @xcite , regulation of dna transcription , dna electrophoresis , water ultrafiltration @xcite and purification @xcite .",
    "conformational behaviour of partially ionized poly(acrylic acid ) ( paa ) in a dilute solution at room temperature has been observed using viscometric titrations against strong bases like ch@xmath0oli and ch@xmath0ona @xcite . among other things ,",
    "these measurements show non - monotonic variation in the reduced viscosity with the increase in the degree of ionization .",
    "while the reduced viscosity is directly proportional to the polymer size through the flory - fox equation and provides an indirect measure of the polyelectrolyte size , the increase in the degree of ionization of paa increases the fraction of charges along the chain , thereby increasing the strength of the electrostatic interaction .",
    "the increase in the reduced viscosity at low degree of ionization is due to electrostatic repulsion between like charged monomers along the polyelectrolyte backbone resulting in polyelectrolyte chain swelling .",
    "the decrease in the reduced viscosity at high degree of ionization is more intriguing , and believed to be due to attractive interaction between ion - pairs ( dipoles ) formed between partially charged polyelectrolyte and oppositely charged counterions .",
    "this effect due to counterion condensation results in polyelectrolyte chain collapse at high degree of ionization .",
    "interestingly , the nature of the collapse transition depends on the size and polarizability of the monovalent counterions , exhibiting continuous reduction in the polyelectrolyte size for smaller and less polarizable li@xmath1 as compared to discontinuous collapse transition for larger and more polarizable na@xmath2 @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "the reduced viscosity at high degree of ionization is close to its initial value at vanishingly small degree of ionization , reminiscent of the re - entrant initial size at high degree of ionization . in the latter case ,",
    "the reduced viscosity at high degree of ionization is much smaller than its initial value at vanishingly small degree of ionization , indicating the polyelectrolyte chain collapse .",
    "moreover , the chain collapse in the presence of na@xmath2 as counterions occurs for much lower electrostatic strength compared to li@xmath2 as counterions .",
    "light scattering and osmotic pressure measurements on paa observe similar trends @xcite .    for an",
    "infinitely long charged rod , the phenomenon of counterion condensation is commonly described using manning s theory @xcite .",
    "the latter shows reduction in the fraction of charges along the polyelectrolyte backbone with the increase in the dimensionless electrostatic strength , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the bjerrum length and @xmath5 is the effective distance between monomers . for a charged polymer ,",
    "the theory of counterion condensation due to manning is only applicable for stiff rod - like polyelectrolytes , where the persistence length of the chain is much larger than the chain length .",
    "the presence of the long - range electrostatic interactions in combination with the polymer elasticity make the phenomenon of counterion condensation in flexible polyelectrolytes much more complex than the manning counterion condensation , and has been the focus of several analytical theories and simulations on strong polyelectrolytes @xcite .",
    "these studies predict non - monotonic variation of the polyelectrolyte size as a function of the electrostatic strength .",
    "simulations also observe the formation of ion - pair due to counter - ion condensation at high electrostatic strength @xcite . however , there is discrepancy in the nature of collapse transition at large electrostatic strength , which is found to be either discontinuous or continuous . in recent simulations of a polyelectrolyte chain in a poor solvent , for instance",
    ", the reduction in the polyelectrolyte size at high electrostatic strength is found to be continuous @xcite .",
    "the reduction in the chain size occurs via a sausage - like phase , and results in a re - entrant poor solvent size at high electrostatic strength @xcite .",
    "another recent simulation , on the other hand , observes a discontinuous chain collapse without the formation of a sausage - like phase , and argues that a continuous collapse transition is an artifact of finite size effects , arising from considering a short polyelectrolyte chain with very low degree of polymerization , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "while it is not clear if @xmath7 and @xmath8 considered in references @xcite and @xcite respectively represent chains with very low degree of polymerization , another theoretical study observing a discontinuous collapse transition suggests that the nature of collapse transition can shift from discontinuous to continuous by varying certain molecular parameters @xcite . although which molecular parameter can bring about such a shift is not clear , viscometric measurements on paa with molar mass @xmath9 g mol@xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) provide evidence that even for chains with very high degree of polymerization the increase in the size and polarizability of the condensed counterions , corresponding to increase in dipole strength of the ion - pairs , shows a shift from a continuous to a discontinuous collapse transition @xcite .",
    "these studies indicate that there are currently discrepancies between theory , simulation and experiment which need to be resolved .    in this work",
    ", we present a self - consistent variational theory which includes the effects of the dipole strength of the ion - pairs , formed between condensed counterions and oppositely charged monomers at high electrostatic strengths , in determining the nature of collapse transition in weak polyelectrolytes .",
    "the theory subsumes all previous results and unifies them in a single framework . in particular ,",
    "a continuous reduction in the polyelectrolyte size with a re - entrant poor , theta or good solvent size at high electrostatic strength and a discontinuous collapse transition to compact globular state independent of the solvent quality observed independently in references @xcite and @xcite respectively are both captured in the present theory by just increasing the dipole strength of the ion pairs , in qualitative agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "the dipole strength of the ion - pairs , which depends of the size and polarizability of the condensed counterions at high electrostatic strength , emerges as an important molecular parameter in influencing the nature of collapse transition and the size of the collapsed state at high electrostatic strength .",

    "this is because as @xmath18 get renormalized and become smaller at high @xmath4 due to counterion condensation , the contribution from monopole - dipole interaction becomes smaller as it depends on @xmath45 compared to @xmath46 dependence of the dipole - dipole interaction .",

    "this can not explain the experimental results which observe a shift from the continuous to the discontinuous transition with the increase in the size and polarizability of the counterions .",
    "thus , a continuous reduction in the polyelectrolyte size and a discontinuous collapse to a compact globular state at high electrostatic strength , observed in independent simulations in references @xcite and @xcite respectively , are subsumed and unified in the present theory which shows a shift from continuous to discontinuous collapse transition with the increase in the dipole strength , in agreement with experiments @xcite .",

    "thus , the reason for either observing continuous collapse transition at low degree of polymerization @xcite or discontinuous collapse transition at high degree of polymerization @xcite in recent simulations can not be merely attributed to finite size effects , but has to considered in relation to the dipole strength of the ion - pairs formed between charged monomers and oppositely charged condensed counterions at high electrostatic strength .",
