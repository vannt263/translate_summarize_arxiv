    "structural inversion asymmetry of the confining electrostatic potential results in an intrinsic spin - orbit coupling of electrons in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas ( eg ) , which can be described by the rashba hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is 2d momentum , @xmath2 is the electron effective mass , @xmath3 is the direction perpendicular to the plane of motion , @xmath4 is the spin - orbit coupling parameter , which can be tuned by applying an external gate voltage perpendicular to the 2d plane , and the components of @xmath5 are the pauli spin matrices .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction lifts the spin degeneracy and causes the original parabolic energy spectrum to split into two branches : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the magnitude of the wave vector .",
    "the density of states of this system is the same as that of the 2d free electron gas for all energies higher than the crossing point of the two branches .",
    "however , at the bottom of the band , the density of states has @xmath8 van hove singularity because the minus branch has an annular minimum for @xmath9 instead of a single - point minimum as in the free electron gas .",
    "these properties lead to interesting phenomena , like the spin hall effect ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for review ) , and to applications in spintronics ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for review ) .",
    "the rashba effect has been seen in many systems like surface alloys and semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "several techniques have been used to study the spin - split states in these systems .",
    "for instance , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite and scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite are used in surface alloys .",
    "the former technique is utilized mainly to obtain the energy dispersion and the fermi surface map , from which the effective mass , the magnitude of the band splitting , and hence the rashba spin - orbit coupling energy , @xmath10 , can be extracted  @xcite . in the latter technique",
    ", the electric current is driven through a sharp tip perpendicular to the 2d plane and the differential conductance ( @xmath11 ) spectrum can be obtained .",
    "one can deduce the rashba energy by fitting the @xmath11 spectrum to the local density of states of the 2deg  @xcite . in both cases , to obtain information about the rashba spin - orbit coupling , extensive data fitting is needed .    in semiconductor heterostructures , the rashba energy is measured using the shubnikov - de haas oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the existence of the spin splitting at the fermi energy leads to beating in the oscillations and the rashba energy can be deduced from the position of the beating node .",
    "however , because this technique is done in the presence of magnetic field , it tends to provide an overestimate of the rashba energy because it includes the effect of the zeeman spin splitting  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we propose a way to measure the spin - splitting energy more directly from the experimental data : the in - plane tunneling spectroscopy . in this technique",
    ", the rashba energy can be determined by the energy difference between two features in the conductance spectrum .",
    "the required condition for the measurement is that the energy resolution of the tunneling spectra is at least of the order of the rashba energy itself .",
    "this condition can be easily achieved in modern tunneling measurements  @xcite .",
    "an intriguing property of 2deg with rashba spin - orbit interaction is spin - dependent transport .",
    "many theoretical investigations have shown that both electric and spin transport in hybrid structures between the rashba system and various materials , like metals  @xcite , ferromagnets  @xcite , and superconductors  @xcite , are affected by the strength of the spin - orbit coupling  @xcite , the inequality of the effective masses  @xcite , and the transparency of the interface  @xcite . however , in these previous studies , only spin - conserving interfacial scattering was considered . in the presence of interfacial spin - flip scattering ,",
    "the equations describing the spin - up and spin - down spin states are coupled and one expects interesting consequences of this .",
    "for instance , in the study of the tunneling conductance spectrum of a semiconductor / superconductor junction  @xcite , the non - spin - flip scattering , when present alone , is found to suppress the andreev reflection process and hence the subgap conductance as expected .",
    "however , when the spin - flip potential scattering is also present at the interface , their combined effect surprisingly enhances the subgap conductance  @xcite .",
    "here , we consider how the scattering potential barrier affects both the conductance spectrum and the spin polarization of the conductance of a junction consisting of a metal and a rashba system . as in previous",
    "work by zutic and das sarma  @xcite , we find that the conductance spectrum , which is usually suppressed in the presence of the interfacial scattering , can be enhanced by the combined effect of both types of scattering .",
    "we also find that the spin polarizations of conductance of the metal and the rashba system are not equal .",
    "the spin polarization in the latter depends weakly on interfacial scattering , while that in the former is greatly affected .",
    "this suggests that a spin imbalance in the rashba system is robust against variation in the quality of the junction interface .    in the next section",
    ", we describe the theoretical method and assumptions . in section",

    "<S> we theoretically studied the in - plane tunneling spectroscopy of the hybrid structure composed of a metal and two - dimensional electron gas with rashba spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the energy spacing between two distinct features in the conductance spectrum can be used to measure the rashba energy . </S>",
    "<S> we also considered the effect that varying the probability of spin - conserving and spin - flip scattering at the interface has on the overall conductance . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , an increase in interface scattering probability can actually result in increased conductance under certain conditions . particularly , in the tunneling regime , </S>",
    "<S> an increase in spin - flip scattering probability enhances the conductance . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that the interfacial scattering greatly affects the spin polarization of the conductance in metal , but hardly affects that in the rashba system . </S>"
