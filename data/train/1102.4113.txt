    "this is in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "however , just like its macroscopic counterpart , a heat pump which directs heat against thermal bias by using external force exists on the molecular level .",
    "recent studies have suggested several such kind of models based on different mechanisms .",
    "et al_. proposed a heat ratchet to direct heat flux from one bath to another in a nonlinear lattice , which periodically adjusts two baths temperatures while the average remains equal  @xcite .",
    "later , ren and li demonstrated that heat energy can be rectified between two baths of equal temperatures at any instant and the correlation between the baths can even direct energy current against thermal bias without external modulations  @xcite . beyond those classical models ,",
    "a quantum heat pump consisting of a molecule connected to two phonon baths was proposed recently  @xcite , and the berry phase effect induced heat pump was unraveled as well  @xcite .",

    "later ai _ et al _ claimed the heat pumping appeared in frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) chain under the influence of a periodic driving force @xcite .",
    "in addition , they observed a thermal resonance phenomenon that the heat flux attained a maximum value at a particular driving frequency , which is similar to the previously found resonance induced by driving bath temperatures  @xcite .",
    "however , other than the temperature driven case , a clear physical mechanism of the driving - force - induced resonance is still unavailable .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the force - driven fk chain as a typical nonlinear lattice model and analyze thermal properties which are frequency dependent .",

    "after the transient time , the transport approaches an oscillatory steady state and the periodic average of local current is equivalent at each site @xmath7 , reading @xmath27 there is no doubt that the thermal resonance exists for the energy current as a function of the driving frequency .",
    "however , surprisingly , we observe that multiple resonance peaks emerge when the amplitude @xmath3 is increased , as shown in fig .",

    "straightforwardly , following the definition , the local energy current can be similarly expanded as well : @xmath57 with @xmath58 written in this form , it is obviously that the contributions of noise term and driving force to the energy current are independent from each other .",
    "we should note this independence comes from the fact that the driving force is not statistically correlated to the heat baths .",
    "since in the present case , the driving force is deterministic , we have dropped the notation of ensemble average @xmath26 in @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 is just the conventional steady - state heat flux , which is proportional to the temperature difference and is given by @xmath61  @xcite .",

    "it is difficult to get the explicit exact solutions for those locally minimized solutions .",
    "nevertheless , much simpler and inspiring results can still be obtained if we consider the limiting case with either small friction coefficient or sufficiently large friction . for small friction , we can just set @xmath90 in eq .   and obtain @xmath91 .",
    "then , the resonant frequencies of the energy current are just the @xmath80 eigenfrequencies of the force matrix @xmath79 . for large friction , by keeping only the highest order terms of @xmath17 in eq .  , we get @xmath92 . in this limiting case",
    ", the resonant frequencies correspond to the @xmath93 eigenfrequencies of @xmath87 .",

    "fig : j_hm ] .",
    "it is not surprising to observe the multiple - peak resonance behavior in the harmonic case , since whenever the driven frequency approaches one of the system s eigenfrequencies , resonance will occur . the number of the eigenfrequencies is mainly determined by the system size .",
    "we can also define other quantities such as the rate of heat released from the two heat baths and rate of work done by the driving force .",
    "their definitions and analytical expressions are given below : @xmath99 where @xmath100 stands for the rate of heat released from the left bath .",
    "the first term is contributed by heat baths and is zero when @xmath101 , while the second term comes from the driving force .",
    "therefore the periodic average at @xmath101 gives @xmath102 similarly , the expression for @xmath103 , the average rate of heat released from the right bath , is given as follows @xmath104 the rate of work done by the driving force is defined as @xmath105 where @xmath2 .",
    "its periodical average gives @xmath106 just like the energy flux , @xmath107 and @xmath103 also show multi - resonance behavior @xcite . by the continuity equation , the energy current flowing out and into a particle must cancel each other when the system reaches its steady state , since the local energy density does not vary with time at steady state .",
    "therefore , we immediately obtain the relation @xmath108 ( @xmath73 ) , which obeys the energy conservation . for the harmonic model , a direct proof is given in the appendix",

    "the main qualitative difference between the multiple - resonance curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrp ] and  [ fig : j_hm ] lies in the fact that the height of the peak for the fk case is smaller than that for the harmonic case , due to the nonlinear on - site potential .",
    "this is more obvious for low and high frequency regime .",
    "more importantly , we notice that the positions of multiple peaks of the two models seem to be close to each other , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom_in ] .",
    "this suggests that the fk model and harmonic model share a similar resonance mechanism . the harmonic model discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : a ] is able to shed lights on the multi - resonance mechanism in a force - driven nonlinear lattice .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that when sampling frequency is not dense enough , one may get a single peak , which actually corresponds to the lower envelope of the multi - resonance curve .",
    "when @xmath3 decreases , the system seems to have a single peak even though we increase the density of the sampling points , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrp ] . the mechanism for the single peak",
    "should still be explained by the fact that the driving frequency is resonant with the system s characteristic frequencies . however , the non - linear potential smooths out the peaks of multi - resonances . in this way",
    ", we can only observe the lower envelope so that only one peak is observable .",
    "thus the single - resonance curve does not completely reflect the intrinsic transport property of the fk model .",
    "let us examine how the parameters of the system will affect the multi - resonance curve .",
    "we have already seen the case of the appearance of multiple peaks when @xmath3 increases , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mrp ] . when @xmath3 becomes large",
    ", the kinetic energy of the particle gained from driving force will be much larger than the height of the on - site potential . in this way",
    ", the mask effect of nonlinear on - site potential becomes negligible and the fk model effectively reduces to a harmonic model without on - site potential .",
    "this is also demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : f10 ] with @xmath110 .",
    "we arbitrarily choose three typical regimes of driving frequency : small , moderate and large @xmath4 .",
    "in all three regimes , the fk model is very close to the harmonic one .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath3 becomes large enough , the mask effect of nonlinearity will fade away and the intrinsic multiple resonant peaks will emerge .",
    "( color online ) heat current vs driven frequency for large force amplitude @xmath110 .",
    "( a ) low frequency regime .",
    "( b ) moderate frequency regime .",
    "( c ) high frequency regime .",
    "other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom_in ] . ]",
    "we are also interested in the effect of temperature . considering that @xmath111 ( defined as @xmath112 ) will take the role of thermal excitation which mainly affects the kinetic energy of particles , we expect",
    "a large value of @xmath111 will have a similar effect with @xmath3 on the resonance behaviors .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrp ] with @xmath113 and @xmath114 , there is no multiple resonances behavior .",
    "while for the increased temperature case @xmath115 , there is clearly a peak in a small @xmath4 range , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t](a ) , which indicates the multiple peaks resonance behavior in the whole frequency range . at low temperature with large amplitude , this is also the case , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : t](b ) . when @xmath111 and @xmath3 are both small , compared to the nonlinear on - site potential @xmath10 , particles are confined near their equilibrium positions , within the valley of non - linear on - site potential . by taylor expansion of the potential to the second order",
    ", we see that the non - linear potential reduces to a harmonic one , so that the harmonic approximation works . in this case",
    ", the lower bound of the phonon band will be raised by @xmath116 . the phonon band in this case is therefore moved from @xmath117 to @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "( accordingly , the phonon band of the harmonic model is shifted by the on - site potential @xmath36 to @xmath119 ) .",
    "energy transport is forbidden outside the frequency region .",
    "it is thus expected to see a shift of the energy flux curve to the right while the multi - resonance are still observed , as shown in fig .",

    "the above discussion reveals that there are mainly three dynamic regimes :    \\(1 ) when @xmath126 ( @xmath127 is the lattice constant as defined previously ) , the fk model will approach a harmonic model _ without _ an on - site potential .",

    "\\(2 ) for the opposite case , in which @xmath128 , the fk model reduces to a harmonic model _ with _ pure harmonic on - site potential of strength @xmath129 .",
    "multi - resonances are still observable .",
    "\\(3 ) when @xmath130 is comparable with @xmath131 , the multiple peaks will be smoothed out by the effect of nonlinear on - site potentials and only single resonant peak is observable . in the intermediate regimes",
    ", there is the crossover from single peak to multiple peaks , of which the resonant magnitudes are smaller compared with those in the harmonic model .",
    "in addition , the heat released from the baths and the work done by the force in fk model also show parameter - dependent multiple resonances @xcite , which can be explained by the same mechanism .",
    "( color online ) @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath30 vs the driving frequency in force - driven fk model .",

    "[ fig : mrp ] .",
    "@xmath134 is negative at all frequencies , showing a negative result for pumping effect . ]    in all simulations so far , we only consider the energy flux flowing into the right reservoir as a whole .",
    "in fact it is a sum of two parts : the rate of heat released from the left reservoir into the system and the rate of work done by @xmath0 , _ i.e _ , @xmath135 .",
    "now let s consider a typical result of energy transport in a force - driven fk lattice with @xmath34 , where these two contributions are separated , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "notably , though @xmath30 is positive ( from @xmath136 to @xmath137 ) in the resonance region , @xmath138 is negative in the full range .",
    "this indicates heat will always flow into the left reservoir from the chain , whatever the driving frequency is .",
    "the corresponding energy flow diagram is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pump](a ) .",
    "this actually shows that the fk system fails to function as a heat pump since normally , a pump should have an energy flow diagram as in fig .",
    "[ fig : pump](b ) , where the heat is absorbed from the low temperature bath and released to the high temperature one .",
    "we have tested a broad range of parameters and even in the regimes with multiple resonances . in all cases ,",
    "the energy never flows as in fig .",
    "[ fig : pump](b ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that there is no heat pumping action in a force - driven fk lattice .",

    "( b ) the situation when a model performs as a heat pump with @xmath139 .",
    "the arrow denotes the direction of the energy flow.,title=\"fig : \" ]    this finding is consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite , wherein it is found that two coupled oscillators of either harmonic or fpu - like interaction would not act as a heat pump under external driving forces .",
    "@xcite gets the opposite conclusion , because they overlook the direction of @xmath138 and claim the model can act as a heat pump whenever @xmath30 flows to the right bath of a higher temperature .    to understand the underling mechanism for the absence of heat pumping in a force - driven lattice system",
    ", we may consider eq .  .",
    "the first stochastic contribution is always negative since @xmath34 . and",
    "the second driving contribution , which does not depend on the temperature , always contributes a negative value as well .",
    "thus , @xmath138 will still be negative , which indicates the low temperature bath always absorbs rather than releases heat , even we may change the position of the driving force .",
    "the situation just corresponds the energy flow diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : pump](a ) .",
    "clearly as long as the effects of the driving force and the baths are independent , eq .   holds for harmonic chain .",
    "thus for a harmonic system , in order to get a heat pump , a necessary condition is that the driving force is statistically correlated to the bath , such that these two contributions could be synergetic .",
    "while in the fk model , effects from the deterministic driving force and stochastic baths are not separable as in eq .   because of the nonlinear on - site potential",
    "however , the nonlinearity can not yet make the two contributions synergetic . and",
    "still , our numerical simulations show a negative result for a force - driven fk lattice acting as a heat pump .",
    "we thus speculate that for both the force - driven harmonic and nonlinear lattice , the correlation may be the key ingredient for the presence of heat pump action , similar to the entanglement in quantum thermal baths @xcite , the off - equilibrium nonthermal reservoirs @xcite and the bath noise correlation in temperature - driven case @xcite , for `` low temperature to high temperature '' thermal transports .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the energy transport control in a force - driven one dimensional nonlinear lattice  the frenkel - kontorova model .",
    "we have found multiple thermal resonances as a function of the driven frequency .",
    "although not exactly the same , the resonant frequencies are closely related to the eigenfrequencies of the force matrix , and the number of resonant peaks is bounded above by the system size @xmath80 . moreover , since the onsite nonlinear potential tends to decrease the magnitude of energy current and smoothes out the multiple peaks , the multi - resonance phenomenon is only observable in certain parameter ranges and the crossover from multiple resonances to single resonance will occur .",
    "finally , by following a rigorous definition of heat pump , we clarify a previous contradiction and conclude that heat pumping effect is absent in force - driven lattices .    in this paper ,",
    "we focus on a one - dimensional chain . however the analysis and results can be generalized to high dimensional system with arbitrary topology , like polymer networks , proteins @xcite , and the three dimensional random elastic network @xcite , of which the eigen - spectra are much more complicated and non - trivial .",
    "the investigation of the resonances in such systems will give us more flexible methods for mechanical control of energy transport in real applications .",

    "<S> energy transport control in low dimensional nano - scale systems has attracted much attention in recent years . in this paper , we investigate the energy transport properties of frenkel - kontorova lattice subject to a periodic driving force , in particular , the resonance behavior of the energy current by varying the external driving frequency . </S>",
    "<S> it is discovered that in certain parameter ranges , multiple resonance peaks , instead of a single resonance , emerge . by comparing the nonlinear lattice model with a harmonic chain , </S>",
    "<S> we unravel the underlying physical mechanism for such resonance phenomenon . other parameter dependencies of the resonance behavior are examined as well . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate that heat pumping is actually absent in this force - driven model . </S>"
