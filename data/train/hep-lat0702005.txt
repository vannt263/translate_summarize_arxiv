    "in order to extract unambiguous signals for the qcd phase transition from the heavy - ion collision experiments , quantitative calculations from first principle are indispensable . at present",
    ", the lattice qcd simulation is the only systematic method to do so and various interesting results have been already reported .",
    "so far , most lattice qcd studies at finite temperature @xmath0 and chemical potential @xmath1 have been performed using staggered - type quark actions with the fourth - root trick of the quark determinant .",
    "thus , the other actions such as the wilson - type quark actions are necessary to control and estimate systematic errors due to lattice discretization .    several years ago , the cp - pacs collaboration has studied the qcd thermodynamics using the iwasaki ( rg ) improved gauge action and the two - flavor clover improved wilson quark action @xcite .",
    "we revisit this action armed with recent techniques at finite chemical potential @xmath2 . in this report",
    ", we present on our preliminary results for the critical temperature at @xmath3 as well as the quark number and isospin susceptibilities at finite @xmath2 .",
    "the latter are related to the physics of the possible critical point in the @xmath4 plane .",
    "the critical temperature ( @xmath5 ) is one of the most fundamental quantities in the qcd thermodynamics .",
    "we renew the analysis of @xmath5 done in @xcite performing additional simulations at @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "we determine the pseudo - critical point @xmath10 defined from the peak of polyakov loop susceptibility on @xmath11 and @xmath12 lattices , as a function of the hopping parameter @xmath13 .",
    "it is confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite that a subtracted chiral condensate satisfies the scaling behavior with the critical exponents and scaling function of the three - dimensional o(4 ) spin model .",
    "the reduced temperature @xmath14 and external magnetic field @xmath15 are identified to @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , where @xmath18 is the critical transition point in the chiral limit .",
    "assuming that the pseudo - critical temperature from the polyakov loop susceptibility follows the same scaling law as the o(4 ) spin model , @xmath19 with @xmath20 , we fit the data of @xmath10 by @xmath21 with two free parameters , @xmath18 and @xmath22 , in the range of @xmath231.95 for @xmath7 and @xmath242.10 for @xmath9 .",
    "first , we adopt the definition @xmath25 as the quark mass where @xmath26 is the chiral point where the pion mass vanishes at @xmath27 for each @xmath28 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left ) .",
    "we calculate the critical temperature @xmath5 in the chiral limit using @xmath29 .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath30 is estimated from the vector meson mass assuming @xmath31 mev at @xmath18 on @xmath26 . by this procedure , we obtain the preliminary results @xmath32 mev for @xmath7 and 174(5 ) mev for @xmath9 .",
    "we also calculate @xmath18 using the relation of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the pseudo - scalar meson mass and @xmath35 is the quark mass obtained from the axial vector ward - takahashi identity .",
    "the results of @xmath5 are 173(3 ) mev @xmath36 , 167(3 ) mev @xmath37 for @xmath38 and 176(3 ) mev @xmath36 for @xmath39 .",
    "we note that these o(4 ) fits reproduce the data of @xmath10 much better than a linear fit @xmath40 . from these analyses ,",
    "we tentatively conclude that the critical temperature in the chiral limit is in the range 170186 mev for @xmath7 and 164179 mev for @xmath9 .",
    "there is still a large uncertainty from the choice of the fit ansatz . to remove this",
    ", we are performing further simulations at lighter quark masses .",
    "next , we compare our results with those of the staggered quark action .",
    "we plot the results of the pseudo - critical temperature ( @xmath41 ) in unit of sommer scale @xmath42 as a function of @xmath43 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) together with those by the rbc - bielefeld collaboration using 2 + 1 flavor p4-improved staggered quark action @xcite .",
    "as seen in this figure , results of @xmath41 obtained by different quark actions seem to approach the same function of @xmath43 as @xmath44 increases .",
    "a care is in order when we convert @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) to @xmath5 ( @xmath41 ) in mev using a physical value of @xmath47 . because the phenomenological estimate of @xmath47 has large theoretical uncertainties , it looks convenient to adopt a lattice result",
    ". unfortunately , lattice results for @xmath47 suffer from sizable ambiguities yet .",
    "the rbc - bielefeld collaboration adopted the value @xmath48 fm , which was obtained by gray _",
    "@xcite from a bottomonium mass splitting using the asqtad - improved staggered quark action . on the other hand",
    ", the cp - pacs+jlqcd collaboration found @xmath49 fm from a study of light hadron spectrum using the clover - improved wilson quark action @xcite .",
    "this leads to about 10 % difference in the value of @xmath5 and makes it difficult to naively compare results from different groups .    [",

    "we reported the current status of our study of qcd thermodynamics using the two - flavor improved wilson quark action .",
    "the critical temperature is estimated from the polyakov loop susceptibilities on @xmath50 and @xmath12 lattices .",
