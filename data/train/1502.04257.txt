    "in this section we define a hamiltonian @xmath1 which will be used to realize the perfect transfer of quantum information in qutrit and qudit chains @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for entanglement creation between chosen points of a chain .",
    "the form of hamiltonian , given below , is naturally suitable for transfers discussed in this work ",
    "i.e. for transmission of information in qutrit spin chains .",
    "the @xmath2 generator is utilized to create the xy - like hamiltonian for qudits .",
    "the construction of suitable @xmath2 generator is given in appendix a. assuming that each qudit has the same freedom level @xmath3 ( the qudit is defined in a similar way to qubit , however a computational base for qudits is expressed with @xmath4 orthonormal vectors  in case of qubits , the base contains two orthonormal vectors ) :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is defined as follows : @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are @xmath2 group operators defined by ( [ lbl : eqn : theta : beta : operators : msawe : jwisn : cn2014 ] ) applied to the @xmath11-th and @xmath12-th qudit . the hamiltonian ( [ lbl : eqn : qudit : pst : hamiltonian : msawe : jwisn : after : cn2015 ] ) will be also called the transfer hamiltonian .",
    "the state transfers , studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite use hamiltonian @xmath13 which have the following property @xmath14 = 0 , \\label{lbl : eqn : qubit : xy : ham : comutator}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 represents the sign gate for qubits .",
    "this means that spins are preserved and dynamics generated by @xmath13 is divided into series of subspaces denoted by the number of qubit in state @xmath16  see in @xcite . in the case discussed here , it is not hard to show that @xmath17 = 0 , \\label{lbl : eqn : qudit : ham : comutator}\\ ] ] for @xmath18 , so the equation ( [ lbl : eqn : qudit : ham : comutator ] ) generalizes the situation mentioned in the equation ( [ lbl : eqn : qubit : xy : ham : comutator ] )  preserving spins and separating dynamics into subspaces .",
    "it is necessary to add that an appropriate unitary operator for transfer operation is determined by the equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents evolution time and @xmath21 represents imaginary unity .",
    "the symbol @xmath22 represents the unitary operation which performs the transfer protocol .",
    "a very important issue raising in the context of information s transfer in spin chains is a problem of the perfect transfer .",
    "if the symbol @xmath23 denotes the initial node of the chain and @xmath24 stands for the final node then a transfer is the perfect transfer when for the time @xmath20 we have : @xmath25 in such a situation there were no distortions and the final and initial states are the same in the meaning of fidelity measure .",
    "introducing a definition of the transfer protocol based on a hamiltonian and a unitary operator allows to describe the transfer ( fig .",
    "[ lbl : fig::ms : jw : cn:2015 ] ) as an algorithm ( or structural quantum program @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "sign @xmath28 expresses that the level of entanglement is comparable with used measure ( e.g. ccnr criterion or concurrence ) .    in this paper",
    "the transfer protocol is used to realize the transmission of information through the path which length equals @xmath24 . in general",
    "the process of transfer involves an unknown qudit state ( where @xmath4 is a freedom level ) : @xmath29 however , in our examples described in further part of this work , we transfer only the qutrit state , i.e. @xmath30",

    "calculating the level of entanglement with use of ccnr criterion and , especially , with concurrence proved to be a good solution for tracking the information transfer in qutrit spin chains .",
    "the concurrence measure indicates unambiguously the details of transfer process and due to this fact , it can be used as an invariant in the algorithmic description of transfer protocol for an unknown qubit state and also for an unknown qutrit state ( generalization for qudit states is also available ) .    naturally , the presented analysis concerns only short spin chains and it should be extended for chains of any length . however , this extension is in fact only estimating the upper bound for concurrence value in a spin chain .",
    "the numerical experiments seem to imply that the length @xmath32 points out the upper bound for concurrence in a spin chain given by the hamiltonian ( [ lbl : eqn : qudit : pst : hamiltonian : msawe : jwisn : after : cn2015 ] ) .    introducing the noise in a form of phase - dumping causes a higher level of entanglement and a lower value of the fidelity measure .",
    "tracking the entanglement level in chains with and without noise allows to study the distortions .",
    "we suppose that analyzing the level of entanglement in chains with and without noise , for example to compare the values of fidelity measure , would be an interesting research issue .",
    "it is important to add that the concurrence measure  apart from its analytical functions , e.g. to track the level of entanglement , as it was shown in the paper  is at present also used in the experiments @xcite where the entanglement is produced in a two - photon system . in @xcite",
    "the concurrence was utilized for spin-1/2 chain which can be realized physically with use of benzene molecules @xcite .",
    "therefore , the functions described in the chapter may be applied as a tool to verify the concurrence in the physical experiments where e.g. qutrits were used .",
