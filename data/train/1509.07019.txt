    "during the last decade there has been a large interest in the study of large complex networks ; see e.g. dorogovtsev and mendes ( 2003 ) and newman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and the references therein .",
    "due to the rapid increase in computer power , it has become possible to investigate various types of real networks such as social contact structures , telephone networks , power grids , the internet and the world wide web .",
    "the empirical observations reveal that many of these networks have similar properties . for instance , they typically have power law degree sequences , that is , the fraction of vertices with degree @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath1 for some exponent @xmath2 . furthermore , many networks are highly clustered , meaning roughly that there is a large number of triangles and other short cycles . in a social network , this is explained by the fact that two people who have a common friend often meet and become friends , creating a triangle in the network .",
    "a related explanation is that human populations are typically divided into various subgroups  working places , schools , associations etc  which gives rise to high clustering in the social network , since members of a given group typically know each other ; see palla et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for some empirical observations .",
    "real - life networks are generally very large , implying that it is a time - consuming task to collect data to delineate their structure in detail .",
    "this makes it desirable to develop models that capture essential features of the real networks . a natural candidate to model",
    "a network is a random graph , and , to fit with the empirical observations , such a graph should have a heavy - tailed degree distribution and considerable clustering .",
    "we will quantify the clustering in a random graph by the conditional probability that three given vertices constitute a triangle , given that two of the three possible links between them exist .",
    "other ( empirical ) definitions occur in the literature  see e.g.  newman ( 2003 )  but they all capture essentially the same thing .",
    "obviously , the classical erds - rnyi graph will not do a good job as a network model , since the degrees are asymptotically poisson distributed . moreover , existing models for generating graphs with a given degree distribution  see e.g.  molloy and reed ( 1995 , 1998 )  typically have zero clustering in the limit . in this paper",
    ", we propose a model , based on the so - called random intersection graph , where both the degree distribution and the clustering can be controlled .",
    "more precisely , the model makes it possible to obtain arbitrary prescribed values for the clustering and to control the mean and the tail behavior of the degree distribution .",
    "the random intersection graph was introduced in singer ( 1995 ) and karoski et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and has been further studied and generalized in fill et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , godehardt and jaworski ( 2002 ) , stark ( 2004 ) and jaworksi et  al .",
    "newman ( 2003 ) and newman and park ( 2003 ) discuss a similar model . in its simplest form",
    "the model is defined as follows",
    "let @xmath3 be a set of @xmath4 vertices and @xmath5 a set of @xmath6 elements . for @xmath7 $ ] ,",
    "construct a bipartite graph @xmath8 with vertex sets @xmath9 and @xmath5 by including each one of the @xmath10 possible edges between vertices from @xmath9 and elements from @xmath5 independently with probability @xmath11 .",
    "2 .   the random intersection graph @xmath12 with vertex set @xmath9 is obtained by connecting two distinct vertices @xmath13 if and only if there is an element @xmath14 such that both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are adjacent to @xmath17 in @xmath8 .",
    "when the vertices in @xmath9 are thought of as individuals and the elements of @xmath5 as social groups , this gives rise to a model for a social network in which two individuals are joined by an edge if they share at least one group . in the following ,",
    "we frequently borrow the terminology from the field of social networks and refer to the vertices as individuals and the elements of @xmath5 as groups , with the understanding that the model is of course much more general .    to get an interesting structure ,",
    "the number of groups @xmath6 is typically set to @xmath18 for some @xmath19 ; see karoski et  al .",
    "we will assume this form for @xmath6 in the following .",
    "let @xmath20 be the degree of vertex @xmath21 in @xmath12 .",
    "the probability that two individuals do not share a group in @xmath8 is @xmath22 .",
    "it follows that the edge probability in @xmath12 is @xmath23 and hence the expected degree is @xmath24 & = & ( n-1)(1-(1-p^2)^m)\\\\ & = & ( n-1)\\left(mp^2+o(m^2p^4)\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to keep the expected degree bounded as @xmath25 , we let @xmath26 for some constant @xmath27 . we then have that @xmath28\\to \\gamma^2 $ ] .",
    "stark ( 2004 ; theorem 2 ) shows that in a random intersection graph with the above choice of @xmath11 , the distribution of the degree of a given vertex converges to a point mass at 0 , a compound poisson distribution or a poisson distribution depending on whether @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "this means that the current model can not account for the power law degree distributions typically observed in real networks .    in the above formulation of the model , the number of groups that a given individual belongs to is binomially distributed with parameters @xmath6 and @xmath11 .",
    "a generalization of the model , allowing for an arbitrary group distribution , is described in godehardt and jaworski ( 2002 ) .",
    "the degree of a given vertex in such a graph is analyzed in jaworski et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , where conditions on the group distribution are specified under which the degree is asymptotically poisson distributed .    in the current paper , we are interested in obtaining graphs where non - poissonian degree distributions can be identified . to this end",
    ", we propose a generalization of the original random intersection graph where the edge probability @xmath11 is random and depends on weights associated with the vertices . other work in this spirit include for instance chung and lu ( 2002:1,2 ) , yao et  al .",

    "the model is defined as follows :    1 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a positive integer , and define @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "as before , take @xmath3 to be a set of @xmath4 vertices and @xmath5 a set of @xmath6 elements .",
    "also , let @xmath34 be an i.i.d .",
    "sequence of positive random variables with distribution @xmath35 , where @xmath35 is assumed to have mean 1 if the mean is finite .",
    "finally , for some constant @xmath27 , set @xmath36 now construct a bipartite graph @xmath37 with vertex sets @xmath9 and @xmath5 by adding edges to the elements of @xmath5 for each vertex @xmath38 independently with probability @xmath39 .",
    "the random intersection graph @xmath40 is obtained as before by drawing an edge between two distinct vertices @xmath13 if and only if they have a common adjacent vertex @xmath41 in @xmath37 .    in the social network setting , the weights can be interpreted as a measure of the social activity of the individuals .",
    "indeed , vertices with large weights are more likely to join many groups and thereby acquire many social contacts .",
    "there are several other examples of real networks where the success of a vertex ( measured by its degree ) depends on some specific feature of the vertex ; see e.g.  palla et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for an example in the context of protein interaction networks .",
    "furthermore , an advantage of the model is that it has an explicit and straightforward construction which , as we will see , makes it possible to exactly characterize the degree distribution and the clustering in the resulting graph .",
    "our results concern the degree distribution and the clustering in the graph @xmath40 as @xmath25 .",
    "more precisely , we will take the parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and the weight distribution @xmath35 to be fixed ( independent of @xmath4 ) and then analyze the degree of a given vertex and the clustering in the graph as @xmath25 .",
    "it turns out that the behavior of these quantities will be different in the three regimes @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the interesting case is @xmath30 , in the sense that this is when both the degree distribution and the clustering can be controlled .",

    "write @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the analog of ( [ p_i ] ) based on the truncated weights .",

    "the fact that individuals share groups should indeed induce positive degree correlation , which agrees with empirical observations from social networks ; see newman ( 2003 ) and newman and park ( 2003 ) .    also other features of the model are worth investigating . for instance , many real networks are `` small worlds '' , meaning roughly that the distances between vertices remain small also in very large networks . it would be interesting to study the relation between the distances between vertices , the degree distribution and the clustering in the current model .",
    "finally , dynamic processes behave differently on clustered networks as compared to more tree - like networks .",
    "most work to date has focused on the latter class . in britton",
    "et  al.(2008 ) however , epidemics on random intersection graphs without random weights are studied and it is investigated how the epidemic spread is affected by the clustering in the graph . it would be interesting to extend this work to incorporate weights on the vertices , allowing to tune also the ( tail of the ) degree distribution and study its impact on the epidemic process .",
