    "in 1986 bednorz and muller @xcite discovered that the perovskite ( bala)@xmath0cuo@xmath1 exhibits high - temperature superconductivity , with a critical temperature of up to 30k .",
    "soon after , la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath1 and yba@xmath0cu@xmath4o@xmath5 were found to have superconducting critical temperatures of 35k and 95k respectively . since then , many such compounds were found , including the tl and hg series .",
    "the current record @xmath6 of 135k ( 165k under pressure ) is found in the hgba@xmath0ca@xmath0cu@xmath4o@xmath7 system . a typical phase diagram is shown in fig . [ fig1 ] .",
    "the undoped parent is an insulator with long range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "extremely low doping ( @xmath8 charge carriers per site ) leads to a complete destruction of the long - range afm order , and a transition to an unusual non - fermi - liquid metal .",
    "this unusual metal becomes superconducting , with the transition temperature @xmath6 strongly dependent on the doping @xmath9 .",
    "the maximum @xmath6 is reached for dopings around @xmath10 . for higher dopings",
    "the critical temperature decreases to zero , and in the overdoped region a crossover towards a ( non - superconducting ) fermi - liquid takes place .",
    "the effective two - dimensional hamiltonian we use to describe the electrons residing in the o(2p@xmath11)-cu(3d@xmath12 ) orbitals of the isolated cuo@xmath0 plane is the generalized one - band hubbard hamiltonian : @xmath13 where @xmath14 creates an electron ( in the orbital centered ) at site @xmath15 with spin @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the hopping amplitude from site @xmath18 to site @xmath15 on the square lattice , @xmath19 is the total number of electrons at site @xmath15 , and @xmath20 is the coulomb repulsion between electrons at sites @xmath15 and @xmath18 .",
    "the dominant terms are the nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath21 and the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath22 . if only these two terms are considered , and we shift the chemical potential by @xmath23 , this reduces to the widely studied hubbard model .    in the undoped parent compound phase ,",
    "there is one electron per orbital , and in the absence of interactions one would expect these compounds to be metallic , with a half - filled conduction band . instead , from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we see that they are insulators with long - range afm order .",
    "this is a strongly - correlated electron system , with a large on - site repulsion term ( @xmath24 ) , which causes electrons to become localized one per each orbital in order to avoid energetically expensive double occupancy .",
    "this obviously leads to insulating behavior , while the antiferromagnetism is simply a perturbational effect from the ( small ) hopping term.@xcite however , as the plane is doped with holes , some of the previously filled orbitals are emptied , and electrons in nearby orbitals can freely hop into them , allowing for charge conduction .",
    "this is also seen from the phase diagram in fig.[fig1 ] , which shows that a very small amount of doping @xmath25 completely destroys the lr afm insulator phase , and the system becomes metallic ( or superconductor , at lower temperatures ) .",
    "however , this metal has very unusual non - fermi liquid properties .",
    "further doping leads to a crossover to a more conventional ( but non - superconducting ) fermi liquid metal in the extremely overdoped region .",
    "understanding the non - fermi liquid metal above the superconducting state is the central issue in the cuprate physics .",
    "some of the most striking evidence of non - fermi - liquid behavior is provided by angle resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , which clearly shows the absence of quasi - particle peaks in the normal state .",
    "equally compelling evidence is provided by resistivity measurements , @xcite which reveal a scattering rate inversely proportional to the temperature @xmath26 , extending over a range of up to 700k.@xcite in an ordinary fermi - liquid , electron - electron scattering gives a @xmath27 dependence of the relaxation rate , related to the quadratic energy dependence of the quasiparticle lifetime @xmath28 .",
    "this is a hallmark of a fermi liquid.@xcite in fact , the canonical @xmath27 behavior is indeed observed in the extremely overdoped region , already identified as a fermi - liquid .",
    "@xcite but its absence in the intermediate doping region of the unusual metal , combined with the absence of quasiparticle peaks in the arpes data clearly show that this unusual metal is not a fermi - liquid",
    ". then , a natural question arises .",
    "if the charge carriers of the unusual metal are not the quasiparticle - like charge carriers of a fermi - liquid , what is their nature ?    some clues are provided by experiments .",
    "hall measurements in the underdoped regime tell us that the charge carriers are positively charged and their density equals the doping , i.e. the hole density.@xcite ( deviations of both the sign and the density scaling are observed for some compounds in the overdoped regions ) .",
    "optical measurements reveal the appearance , with doping , of a low - frequency drude tail , which suggests the existence of free , or very mobile charge carriers .",
    "@xcite these optical measurements confirm both the anomalous @xmath29 scattering rate of these charge carriers , as well as the fact that their density equals the doping .",
    "together , these measurements suggest that each hole introduced in the cuo@xmath0 layer evolves into a mobile , positively charged , carrier ( but not a quasiparticle ) .",
    "however , both types of measurements show other anomalous behavior as well .",
    "the hall coefficient has a strong , @xmath29 temperature dependence , which is very puzzling , since neither the density nor the charge of the carriers is temperature dependent , and neither is the lorentz force .",
    "the optical measurements reveal that the drude tail is accompanied by the appearance of a broad , mid - infrared band deep inside the mott - hubbard gap.@xcite this mid - infrared band develops with doping , and signifies the existence of localized levels inside the mott - hubbard gap .",
    "unlike the drude tail which collapses below @xmath6 to a @xmath30 function , this mid - infrared response persists unchanged both above and below @xmath6 .",
    "magnetic measurements indicate that although the lr afm is completely suppressed above @xmath25 , strong short - range afm correlations persist , with a correlation length roughly equal to the average distance between the holes ( charge carriers).@xcite neutron scattering indicates the appearance of incommensurate peaks in the magnetic structure factor , with a shift from the afm @xmath31 vector varying linearly with doping for @xmath32 and then saturating .",
    "the four incommensurate peaks are arranged diagonally for @xmath33 and then rotate by 45@xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite the doping dependence of all these features clearly indicates that magnetism is crucial to the entire phenomenology .",
    "more puzzling behavior appears in the superconducting state .",
    "flux quantization clearly proves that pairing does take place , and the unit of charge in the superconducting condensate is @xmath36 .",
    "arpes and phase sensitive measurements have shown that the superconducting gap has @xmath37-wave symmetry , and this is believed to mirror the symmetry of the `` cooper - pair '' wave - function to internal rotations .",
    "penetration depth measurements show that the density of superfluid in the limit @xmath38 scales with doping .",
    "this means that the `` cooper - pairs '' must , in fact , be formed from the positive charge carriers of the unusual metal , not from electrons , as in conventional bcs theory ( the density of electrons is @xmath39 , not @xmath9 ) .",
    "this underscores the need to identify the charge carrier of the unusual metal , but leads to another question , namely , how does strong pairing ( leading to high superconducting temperatures ) occur in a system dominated by strong coulomb repulsion ?    in this paper we describe a microscopic model which offers simple and compelling answers to the above questions , as well as to other puzzling features described above . unlike other approaches which assume that the fundamental quantum degrees of freedom of the many - electron system are conventional and that the resulting phenomenology is an `` emergent law of nature '' arising from the complexity of the system",
    ", we propose that there is a _",
    "hidden fundamental law of nature_. this fundamental law of nature expresses a novel dynamical degree of freedom , namely that an electron can perform a `` somersault '' in its internal space of euler angles ( when considered as a rigid body of non - zero volume ) as the electron traverses a closed loop in external coordinate space .",
    "the result is a new quantum number for the many - electron system ( the eigenvalues of the spin - flux ) , which we propose is as fundamental as the existence of the spin-@xmath40 itself .",
    "we argue that the electronic somersault ( spin - flux ) is dynamically generated through electromagnetic interactions and in particular , the off - diagonal part of the coulomb repulsion between electrons . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the spin - flux hamiltonian , which we propose as the appropriate hamiltonian describing the isolated cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "in section [ sec3 ] we apply hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) and the configuration interaction ( ci ) method to the spin - flux hamiltonian and we identify both the mobile bosonic charge carrier as well as the nature and symmetry of the strong pairing interaction between such charge carriers .",
    "we provide a physical justification for the accuracy of the ci approximation and we explicitly demonstrate this by comparison with the exact solution of the 1d hubbard model.@xcite finally , in section [ sec5 ] we discuss the comparison of our model and its results with the experimental findings and draw some final conclusions .",
    "the neglect of the dynamical consequences of longer range coulomb interaction ( @xmath41 , if @xmath42 ) , in the generalized hubbard model of eq .",
    "( [ i1 ] ) , is based on the assumption of uniform charge distribution and on the fermi - liquid theory notion of screening of the effective electron - electron interaction .",
    "however , fermi liquid theory fails to explain many of the crucial features of the high - t@xmath43 cuprates . in our description",
    ", we include the nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion , which we assume is on the energy scale of @xmath44 .",
    "this has important dynamical consequences in our model and can not simply be absorbed into the madelung constant .",
    "in particular , it leads to the generation of spin - flux , an entirely new type of broken symmetry in the many - electron system , which we show leads naturally to bosonic charge carriers in the form of meron - vortices , non - fermi - liquid behavior and a strong attractive pairing force between holes in the afm background .",
    "the concept of spin - flux is closely related to the existence of the spin@xmath45 particles in nature .",
    "the spin of a physical electron may be regarded as arising from the quantization of a classical , symmetric spinning top@xcite whose kinematical properties are described by a set of three independent euler angles .",
    "these euler angles constitute a continuous manifold , the group manifold of so(3 ) .",
    "unlike the manifold s@xmath0 ( the surface of a unit sphere ) describing the orientation of a classical magnetic moment , the group manifold of so(3 ) is _ not _ topologically simply connected .",
    "according to the axioms of quantum mechanics any physical wave - function must be everywhere continuous and differentiable .",
    "for this to be satisfied on a simply connected manifold , the wave - function must be single valued .",
    "consequently the o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model describes integer spins .",
    "the doubly connected group manifold of so(3 ) , however , can accommodate two - valued wave - functions which are everywhere continuous and differentiable .",
    "this leads to half - integer spins . in order to accommodate spin@xmath46 , the o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model",
    "must be supplemented with a magnetic monopole which is placed at the center of the sphere s@xmath47.@xcite the charge of this monopole corresponds to a quantum of the third euler angle in the parameterization of the so(3 ) group manifold .",
    "spin - flux arises when the electron executes a topologically nontrivial path within its internal space of euler angles while it traverses a closed loop in the external coordinate space .",
    "the internal path is one that can not continuously be deformed to zero and corresponds to a @xmath48 rotation ( somersault ) in the space of euler angles .",
    "another depiction of this process ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) is seen by considering distinct points within the spinning top and following their trajectories as the electron executes a closed path in external coordinate space . in a non - spin - flux circuit",
    ", the two trajectories are unlinked , whereas in a spin - flux circuit ( involving a somersault ) the two trajectories are linked .",
    "we propose that this novel possibility represents a hidden but fundamental law of nature which has not been considered in conventional treatments of many - body theory .",
    "spin - flux corresponds to a fundamentally new quantum number in a many - electron system and requires the extension of the conventional many - electron hilbert space .",
    "we suggest that this simple addition ( at a fundamental level ) to the dynamical degrees of freedom of interacting electrons an a two - dimensional lattice leads to a unified , microscopic explanation of a large variety of experiments on the cuprates .    in order to describe the above physics from our starting hamiltonian , @xmath49 we introduce bilinear combination of electron operators @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath51 , for @xmath42 ( summation over multiple indexes is assumed ) .",
    "here @xmath52 is the @xmath53 identity matrix and @xmath54 are the usual pauli spin matrices .",
    "the notation @xmath55 means that the sites @xmath15 and @xmath18 are nearest neighbors .",
    "the quantum expectation value @xmath56 of the @xmath57 operators are associated with charge - currents ( @xmath58 ) and spin - currents ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "non - vanishing charge currents lead to appearance of electromagnetic fields , which break the time - reversal symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "experimentally , this does not occur in the cuprates . in the following ,",
    "we adopt the ansatz that there is no charge current in the ground state @xmath60 but circulating spin - currents may arise and take the form @xmath61 , where @xmath62 for all @xmath15 and @xmath18 , and @xmath63 is a unit vector .",
    "these spin - currents provide a transition state to the uniform spin - flux mean - field that we use in this paper . in principle , non - uniform states of spin - flux may arise , in which @xmath64 has a nontrivial dependence on @xmath15 and @xmath18 .",
    "one such case was discussed earlier , @xcite in which skyrmion textures in the afm background carry quantized units of spin - flux . in this case",
    "@xmath65 is a dynamical variable .",
    "however , for the purpose of this paper , we consider only a uniform , static , mean - field configuration of the spin - flux .    using the pauli spin - matrix identity , @xmath66 , it is possible to rewrite the nearest - neighbor electron - electron interaction terms as @xmath67 .",
    "we neglect fluctuations in the spin - currents , and use the mean - field factorization to replace @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the quartic nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction term is reduced to a quadratic term that is added to the hopping term leading to the effective hamiltonian : @xmath69 here , @xmath70 are spin - dependent @xmath71 hopping matrix elements defined by the mean - field theory , and @xmath72 . in deriving ( [ 1.104 ] ) we have dropped constant terms which simply change the zero of energy as well as terms proportional to @xmath73 which simply change the chemical potential .",
    "it was shown previously @xcite that the ground state energy of the hamiltonian of eq.([1.104 ] ) depends on the su(2 ) matrices @xmath74 only through the plaquette matrix product @xmath75 . here",
    ", @xmath76 is the spin - flux which passes through each plaquette and @xmath77 is the angle through which the internal coordinate system of the electron rotates as it encircles the plaquette .",
    "since the electron spinor wave - function is two - valued , there are only two possible choices for @xmath76 .",
    "if @xmath78 we can set @xmath79 and the hamiltonian ( [ 1.104 ] ) describes conventional ordered magnetic states of the hubbard model .",
    "the other possibility is that a spin - flux @xmath80 penetrates each plaquette , leading to @xmath81 .",
    "this means that the one - electron wave - functions are antisymmetric around each of the plaquettes , i.e. that as an electron encircles a plaquette , its wave - function in the internal spin space of euler angles rotates by @xmath48 in response to strong interactions with the other electrons . in effect",
    ", the electron performs an internal `` somersault '' as it traverses a closed path in the cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "@xcite this spin - flux phase is accompanied by a afm local moment background ( with reduced magnitude relative to the afm phase of the conventional hubbard model ) . in the spin - flux phase , the kinetic energy term in ( [ 1.104 ] ) exhibits broken symmetry as though a spin - orbit interaction has been added . in the presence of charge carriers this mean - field is unstable to the proliferation of topological fluctuations ( magnetic solitons ) which eventually destroy afm long range order . in this sense",
    ", the analysis which we present below goes beyond simple mean field theory .",
    "the quantum dynamics of these magnetic solitons described by the configuration interaction ( ci ) method , corresponds to tunneling effects not contained in the hartree - fock approximation . for simplicity",
    ", throughout this paper we assume that the mean - field spin - flux parameters @xmath74 are given by the simplest possible choice @xmath82 ( for more details , see ref . 14 ) . in order to go beyond a mean - field description of the spin - flux , these matrices",
    "may also be treated as dynamical variables . in this paper , we go beyond mean - field theory in describing the antiferromagnetic degrees of freedom but restrict ourselves to a mean - field model of the spin - flux .",
    "the mean - field ground - state of the undoped spin - flux model is an afm mott insulator .",
    "it is interesting to note that the quasi - particle dispersion relation obtained in the presence of the spin - flux@xcite accurately recaptures the dispersion as measured through angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) in a compound such as sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "there is a a large peak centered at @xmath83 with an isotropic dispersion relation around it , observed on both the @xmath84 to @xmath85 and @xmath86 to @xmath87 lines .",
    "the spin - flux model in hfa exhibits another smaller peak at @xmath88 which has been observed in more recent experimental data.@xcite the quasi - particle dispersion relation of the conventional hubbard model ( @xmath89 ) has a large peak at @xmath90 on the @xmath84 to @xmath85 line ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , but it is perfectly flat on the @xmath86 to @xmath87 line ( which is part of the large nested fermi surface of the conventional 2d hubbard model ) . also , it has a large crossing from the upper to the lower band - edge on the @xmath84 to @xmath86 line . both this dispersion relation and the very similar one of the @xmath91 model ( see ref .",
    "15 ) are in contradiction to arpes data .",
    "the hf results for the undoped afm ground state of the spin - flux hamiltonian are in good agreement with experimentally measured dispersion ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the azimuthal symmetry of the dispersion relations about the fermi points plays a key role in determining the symmetries of doping induced magnetic configurations .",
    "this is more straightforward to see in a simpler , continuum version of the model , obtained by letting the lattice constant @xmath92 ( see ref",
    ". 17,18 ) . since the dispersion relation near the fermi point @xmath93 is isotropic , the dependence on @xmath94 of the continuum hf equations is such that it preserves rotational invariance . as a result ,",
    "the 2d hf equation reduces trivially to a 1d radial equation , with a structure very similar to that of the 1d differential hf equation obtained for the 1d hubbard model.@xcite once this radial 1d solution is found , the 2d configuration is simply generated through a @xmath48 rotation about an axis perpendicular to the 2d plane . as a result , there is a close analogy between solutions obtained for the 1d hubbard model and for the 2d spin - flux model , in all our investigations.@xcite    in the corresponding discrete model , the relevant doped configuration is the meron - vortex ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "the doping hole is trapped in the core of a magnetic vortex , which indeed has azimuthal symmetry . the bound level on which the hole is trapped can be shown@xcite to be split from the top of the valence band and drawn deep inside the mott - hubbard gap . as a result , the meron - vortex is a charged boson .",
    "this can be inferred by direct inspection of fig.[fig4 ] , which shows a configuration with total spin zero and a positive charge trapped in its core .",
    "an argument based on the electronic structure , identical to the one offered for the charged bosonic domain - walls of the polyacetylene , also holds.@xcite the parallel to the quasi - one dimensional 1d polyacetylene is again a reflection of azimuthal symmetry which reduces the 2d continuum model to a 1d radial equation .",
    "clearly , the isotropic dispersion about the fermi points is responsible for the appearance of _ bosonic _ charge carriers .",
    "they are very unlike quasi - particle charge carriers , which carry both spin and charge together .",
    "thus , one would expect a metal with such bosonic charge carriers to have intrinsically different properties from those of a fermi - liquid metal .",
    "a look at the spin - configuration in fig.[fig4 ] also shows that this can not be realized if cyclic boundary conditions ( cbc ) are imposed . with them ,",
    "the self - consistent solution found in the presence of one hole is a very different configuration called the spin - bag , which is a rather immobile quasiparticle - like configuration ( carrying both charge @xmath95 and spin-@xmath40).@xcite however , for more than one hole added to the afm plane , the hf ground - state of the spin - flux hamiltonian always shows meron - vortices created through doping , even with cbc.@xcite the simple reason for this is that while a single isolated meron - vortex is incompatible with cbc , meron - antimeron pairs are not ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for a typical meron - antimeron configuration ) .",
    "in fact , the nucleation of merons and antimerons in pairs also solves another problem , related to the energetic cost of creating a meron .",
    "it is straightforward to prove that the energy of a single meron configuration increases logarithmically with its size.@xcite beyond a certain ( large ) separation it is energetically favorable for the meron - antimeron pair to collapse into a pair of charged spin bags . in the conventional hubbard model ( with no spin - flux )",
    "spin bags are favored at all separations . in the spin - flux phase , the farther the meron is from the antimeron , the more spins in between are rotated by the vortices , and the excitation energy increases . as a result , an isolated pair tends to be as closely bound as possible .",
    "if the vortices were uncharged , at low temperatures they would annihilate each other . however , the holes localized in the vortex cores lead to a very strong short - range coulomb repulsion which prevents the pair annihilation , thus making the pair stable . it is worth noting that even in the complete absence of screening , at long distances the @xmath96 coulomb repulsion would be overcome by the @xmath97 attraction between vortices , leading to a stable bound pair .    to conclude , we see that even at the static hf level , charge carriers in the spin - flux phase exhibit bosonic nature , and a strong pairing attraction to other charge carriers .",
    "this attraction is of magnetic origin , arising from exchange energy lost by spins which are no longer perfectly afm aligned .",
    "the importance of the bosonic meron - vortex excitations becomes even more apparent when we consider fluctuation and tunneling corrections to the hf approximation .",
    "these correspond to translational motion of the charged vortices .",
    "it turns out that charged meron - vortices have an effective mass comparable to that of the band electron .",
    "as seen from the ci method , they are much more mobile than the very heavy spin - bags .",
    "we now discuss how to improve the mean - field description above . given a complete basis of states @xmath98 spanning the @xmath99-body hilbert space , the exact @xmath99-body ground state wave - function can be written as @xmath100 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath101 are found from solving the schrdinger equation @xmath102 , which reduces to a linear system of equations @xmath103 , for all @xmath15 .",
    "here , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the matrix elements of the hamiltonian in the complete basis chosen and the overlapping matrix for the basis states , respectively .",
    "in general , the number of basis states of the @xmath99-body problem increases exponentially with @xmath99 , and the problem becomes untractable for values of @xmath99 which are rather small . to deal with large values of @xmath99 ,",
    "one is forced to truncate the complete basis set , and only retain a smaller subset of states which are most likely to contribute substantially in the decomposition of the ground - state wave - function .",
    "the choice of this smaller subset is the crucial issue , since it determines the quality of the approximation . in what follows ,",
    "we describe a particular subset which allows us to recapture certain key features of the exact bethe ansatz solution of the 1d hubbard model .",
    "consider the set of slater determinants generated from the hartree - fock solution .",
    "its states are @xmath106 and all possible particle - hole excitations @xmath107 , @xmath108 etc . obviously , if all possible combinations of occupied and empty orbitals are considered , the set thus spanned is a complete basis of the @xmath99-body space .",
    "let us now order the states in this hf basis set according to their energies @xmath109 . if we are interested in the ground - state and the low - lying excitations of the system , we only need to keep the low - energy states of the hf basis set .",
    "this procedure is , in fact , very well known for hamiltonians with a _ non - degenerate _",
    "hf ground - state .",
    "if only the hf ground - state and the states with one particle - hole excitations are kept , this leads to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . besides a better approximation for the ground - state than simple hfa , the rpa enables us to find collective excitations and the particle - hole continuum .",
    "on the other hand , the doped hf ground - states of the spin - flux hamiltonian are _",
    "degenerate_. for instance , the meron - antimeron pair shown in fig.[fig5 ] happens to be centered at site ( 10,10 ) .",
    "it is obvious that configurations which have the meron - antimeron pair centered about any other site will have the exact same hf energy ( cyclic boundary conditions are imposed ) .",
    "also , if the center for the pair is fixed at a site , there are four distinct possible arrangements of the meron and antimeron about that site , obtained by rotating the meron - antimeron axis by 90@xmath34 .",
    "thus , for a plaquette of size @xmath110 , the hf ground state is @xmath111 degenerate .",
    "clearly , the minimal choice for the subset of states used to search for the ground - state of the doped system must include all these degenerate hf ground - state wave - functions .",
    "this choice is the essence of the configuration interaction ( ci ) approximation.@xcite one expects these hf states to mix with equal weight @xmath112 in the decomposition of the ground - state and low - energy states @xmath113 .",
    "specifically , we denote @xmath114 to be the hf ground - state wave - function describing a configuration centered at site @xmath115 of the lattice , and with the meron - antimeron axis at an angle @xmath116 from the @xmath9-axis . then , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 or @xmath120 . on general symmetry grounds",
    "one expects the ground - state and the low - lying energy states to have the general form @xmath121 the cyclic boundary conditions limit the vector @xmath122 to a subset of equally spaced values inside the first brillouin zone and @xmath123 must be an integer .",
    "eq.([3.1 ] ) shows that the ground - state and low - lying energy states found within the ci method have translational and rotational symmetry .",
    "this procedure overcomes the most glaring shortcoming of the mean - field theory ( the broken translational and rotational invariance ) .",
    "clearly , the ci wave - functions describe quantum dynamics of the charge carriers .",
    "the pair is no longer pinned at one site , as in hfa , but moves over the entire lattice .",
    "the mobility of the pair and its preferred internal angular momentum can be obtained from the dispersion relation @xmath124 .",
    "the lowest energy band of the meron - antimeron pair obtained for @xmath125 is shown in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "@xcite we find that the ci ground - state corresponds to pairs of total momentum @xmath126 , and which have @xmath37-wave symmetry , @xmath127 .",
    "in fact , @xmath123 varies throughout the brillouin zone as shown in fig.[fig7 ] , from pure @xmath37-wave around the @xmath128 points to pure @xmath129-wave around the @xmath84 point , where a second local minimum exists .",
    "the large width ( @xmath130 ) of the dispersion band clearly proves that the meron - antimeron pair is a very mobile excitation .",
    "the existence of mobile charged bosonic merons and antimerons thus provides a microscopic basis for the non - fermi liquid `` parent '' metal from which superconductivity emerges .    as an indication of the validity and accuracy of the ci method",
    ", we briefly review the results of such an analysis of the 1d hubbard model.@xcite here , the analog of the a charged meron - vortex is the charged domain wall soliton which facilitates a @xmath131 flip from one afm ground - state to the other afm ground - state ( with all spins flipped ) .",
    "the charged domain - wall traps the hole on a pair of levels that are localized deep inside the mott - hubbard gap , and is a charged boson.@xcite the analog of the spin - bag is the spin - polaron , which disturbs the afm order only locally , trapping the hole in its small fm core . as a result ,",
    "the spin - polaron carries both charge and spin@xmath46 . in fig.[fig8 ] we show the hf ( circles ) and ci ( squares ) energies of both the spin - polaron ( full line ) and the charged domain - wall ( dashed line ) . for the spin - polaron ,",
    "the difference between the hf and ci energy varies as @xmath132 . in analogy with the 2d case ,",
    "this is the expected behavior since the spin@xmath45 carried by the spin - polaron localizes it on one magnetic sublattice .",
    "on the other hand , the domain - wall lowers its energy by an amount of the order @xmath44 between the hf and the ci values .",
    "this clearly shows that the charged domain - wall is a very mobile objects , and that its dynamics must be properly described in order to get a realistic picture .",
    "when this is done , it is apparent that the charged domain - wall is the low energy excitation over the entire @xmath133 range , and in fact its energy is in excellent agreement with the exact bethe ansatz prediction ( shown as diamonds ) .    finally , we consider the stability of the ground - state and the low - lying energy states to inclusion of more states in the subset used to generate them",
    ". the next meaningful enlargement of this subset is to add to it all states with one particle - hole excitation , obtained from all degenerate hf ground - state wave - functions .",
    "while this increases the size of the subset substantially , it does not lead to a lower ground - state energy .",
    "this is because the system is gapped .",
    "the lowest energy particle - hole excitation is obtained when an electron from the top of the valence band is excited on one of the bound levels , localized in the cores of the meron and the antimeron .",
    "these levels are roughly one quarter of the way into the gap ( for @xmath125 ) , so the states with a particle hole excitation have an energy of order @xmath134 more than the hf ground - states .",
    "consequently they do not mix into the ground - state .",
    "they only influence the higher energy states .",
    "the low - lying excitations depicted in fig . [ fig6 ] are _ charge _",
    "excitations , associated with motion of the charged meron - antimeron pair .",
    "these are not affected by addition of excited states in the variational subset , except at rather high energy .",
    "but there also exist low - lying _ spin - wave _ excitations , which are described by adding particle - hole excited states ( rpa ) in the variational subset . while it is very likely that the nucleation of merons and antimerons in the afm background will alter the dispersion of the spin - waves , it is interesting to note that low - lying charge and low - lying spin excitations have very different origin .",
    "this is related to the spin - charge separation tendency exhibited by this system .",
    "if a single hole is added to the 2d afm plane and the cyclic boundary conditions are imposed , the hf approximation leads to a spin - bag mean - field solution for the spin - flux phase .",
    "we analyze the translational properties of the spin - bag using the ci method .",
    "as it turns out,@xcite is that the spin - bag is a very immobile object .",
    "the width of its dispersion band is of the order of @xmath132 , i.e. much smaller than the @xmath135 bandwidth of the meron dispersion .",
    "the reason is that the spin - bag carries both charge and spin-@xmath136 .",
    "the spin-@xmath40 only allows the spin - bag to live on one of the magnetic sublattices .",
    "( if it were to move to the other sublattice , its spin should flip , and such processes are forbidden ) . in order to move ,",
    "a spin - bag must tunnel two sites to a second - nearest neighbor site , and this is a @xmath132 process . on the other hand , the charged meron carries no spin , so there are no restrictions for its motion .",
    "it can move to a nearest neighbor site , leading to a @xmath44-hopping process .",
    "this suggests that when dynamics is properly taken into consideration within ci , a highly mobile vortex - antivortex pair sharing a single hole is energetically favored to the immobile spin - bag .",
    "we have verified this hypothesis , and demonstrated that an upper bound to the energy of a singly - charged vortex - antivortex pair is , indeed , much lower than the ci energy of spin - bag.@xcite the charged spin - bag solution is thus unstable to dissociation into a highly mobile vortex - antivortex pair , which shares the hole .",
    "when a second hole is added , a second single - charged vortex - antivortex pair is nucleated .",
    "however , it becomes energetically more convenient for the two holes to become bound to the same vortex - antivortex pair , leading to the appearance of a meron - antimeron pair which carries both charges ( pre - formed d - wave pair ) .",
    "the remaining uncharged vortex - antivortex pair is unstable to collapse , at low temperatures .",
    "the crucial distinguishing feature of our model is the concept of spin - flux , the dynamical possibility of an electron undergoing a somersault as it traverses a closed loop . in the undoped parent compound",
    ", this leads to dispersion relations with isotropic symmetry about the fermi point , in excellent agreement with those measured experimentally through arpes .",
    "this symmetry of the dispersion relations leads to real - space configurations which have the same type of symmetry . in the spin - flux model , the holes doped into the afm plane nucleate magnetic vortices and become trapped in their cores , leading to the appearance of mobile , bosonic , charge carriers .",
    "in contrast , both the conventional hubbard model and its asymptotic limit , the t - j model , exhibit a very large , nested fermi surface ( at the mean - field level ) in the undoped parent compound .",
    "this fermi surface has quasi - linear 1d character , since there is no @xmath137-dependence along the fermi surface . as a result ,",
    "configurations stabilized by doping exhibit the same quasi-1d character in real space .",
    "it has been suggested they take the form of charged stripes .",
    "@xcite we note finally that vortex - like configurations are unstable in the conventional hubbard model , while stripe - like configurations are generally unstable to the formation of a quantum liquid of merons in the spin - flux model .",
    "one notable exception is the commensurate case @xmath138 , when merons and antimerons crystallize along 1d lines , leading to the stripe - like configuration observed experimentally,@xcite provided that a small ( 3% ) hopping anisotropy is included in the model .",
    "@xcite    the mobile bosonic charged meron - vortices created through doping provide a microscopic basis for a non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "they also exhibit a very strong pairing attraction , of magnetic origin .",
    "this pairing , which arises in a purely repulsive electron system , leads to appearance of pre - formed `` cooper - pairs '' of @xmath37-wave symmetry .",
    "this agrees with the experimental findings of @xmath37-wave superconductivity and the scaling of the superfluid density with doping .",
    "the pre - formed pairs may also be related to the observation of a pseudo - gap on the underdoped side of the phase diagram .",
    "@xcite    many other features of our model are in agreement with experimentally observed properties of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "nucleation of magnetic vortices with doping explains a variety of magnetic properties , starting with complete destruction of the long - range afm order for very low doping concentration . as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , a tightly - bound meron - antimeron pairs disturbs the long - range afm ordering of about 100 spins of the lattice . for very low dopings , these pairs are far from each other , and there are many spins on the plane whose",
    "orientations are not affected by any pair .",
    "thus , most of the spins maintain the long range afm order . however , as the doping increases over about @xmath139 , the areas occupied by each meron - antimeron pairs start to overlap with those occupied by the neighboring pairs . at",
    "this doping the orientation of all the spins on the cuo@xmath0 planes is affected by at least one pair of vortices , and therefore the lro is lost .",
    "the local ordering , however , is still afm .",
    "this picture explains the extremely low doping necessary for the disappearance of lr afm order , as well as the fact that the spin correlation length is basically equal to the average distance between holes ( vortices ) and does not depend strongly on the temperature.@xcite each hole carries its vortex with it , and the spins in each vortex are correlated with each other .",
    "the correlation length is thus roughly equal to the average inter - vortex ( inter - hole ) distance .",
    "the nucleation of magnetic vortices quantitatively explains the split of the @xmath85 afm bragg peak into the four incommensurate peaks whose positions shift with doping,@xcite as observed in lacuo and , more recently , in ybacuo.@xcite the form factor of any given vortex already gives rise to an apparent splitting of the neutron scattering peak . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "14 , even at the mean - field level we recapture the neutron scattering data using the hf distribution of meron - vortices .",
    "a more detailed investigation suggests that saturation@xcite of the peak splitting for @xmath140 may be related to expansion of the core radius of the individual vortices at higher doping.@xcite    optical behavior of the cuprates is also explained naturally using our model .",
    "two features develop in the optical absorption spectra with doping : a broad mid - infrared temperature - independent absorption band , and a strongly temperature - dependent low - frequency drude tail . @xcite in our model the broad mid - infrared band is related to excitation of electrons from the valence band onto the empty levels bound in the vortex cores , @xcite which are localized approximately one quarter of the way inside the mott - hubbard gap .",
    "the number of localized levels scales with the number of vortices , and inter - vortex and spin - wave interactions lead to their broadening into the observed band .",
    "this mechanism is similar to the one leading to a broad mid - infrared absorption band in polyacetylene with doping .",
    "@xcite ( in the continuum limit , the meron vortex in fact creates a pair of mid - gap states in the mott - hubbard gap@xcite ) .",
    "the polyacetylene band is due to electronic excitations inside the cores of the polyacetylene domain - wall solitons,@xcite which are the topological analogues of meron - vortices.@xcite another strong argument in favor of this interpretation is provided by photoinduced absorption experiments .",
    "@xcite if the undoped parent compounds are illuminated with intense visible light , they develop absorption bands that resemble the mid - infrared bands of the doped compounds .",
    "similar behavior is observed in polyacetylene , and is attributed to the nucleation of solitons by photoexcited electron - hole pairs . @xcite    the second component of the optical spectrum is the drude tail .",
    "it results from the response of the freely moving charged vortices to the external electric field .",
    "the strong temperature dependence of this tail is determined by the scattering mechanism for merons ( due to interactions with other merons and spin - waves ) .",
    "this interpretation is also supported by the fact that the superconducting transition leaves the mid - infrared absorption band unchanged .",
    "merons with internal electronic structure are still present on the planes but pair condensation leads to a collapse of the drude tail into a @xmath30 response .    finally , our model provides some understanding of the cross - over towards the fermi - liquid metal in the overdoped phase . for large dopings ( @xmath141",
    ") the average inter - vortex spacing becomes extremely small and the very cores of the merons start to overlap . in this limit the mott - hubbard gap is completely filled in by the discrete levels , and the spin - flux state becomes energetically unstable relative to a normal fermi liquid .",
    "@xcite    we note , finally , that the spin - flux hamiltonian has essentially no free or adjustable parameters .",
    "the choice of @xmath133 is fixed by the experimentally measured size of the mott - hubbard charge transfer gap at zero doping .",
    "all other experimental features such as ( i ) the position and nature of the mid - infrared optical absorption band , ( ii ) the arpes data and ( iii ) the position of the magnetic neutron scattering satellite peaks as a function of doping , are quantitatively described by the same choice .",
    "more detailed comparisons with specific experiments may require the incorporation of specific ( smaller energy scale ) interactions which are not included in this simplest version of the spin - flux hamiltonian .",
