    "the cp violation is among the most interesting physical phenomena and the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of fermions are important tools to understand it since edms are driven by the cp violating interaction",
    ". there are various experimental and theoretical works done in the literature and the experimental results of the electron , muon and tau edms are @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite , respectively . furthermore , the experimental upper bound of neutron edm has been found as @xmath5 @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , the source of cp violation in the standard model ( sm ) is the complex cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) ; lepton mixing matrix in the quark ; lepton sector and the calculation of fermion edms shows that their numerical values are negligible in the sm . in work",
    "@xcite , the quark edms have been estimated as @xmath6 , which is a small quantity since the non - zero contribution exists at least in the three loop level . in order to enhance the fermion edms",
    ", one needs an alternative source of cp violation and the additional contributions coming from the physics beyond the sm .",
    "the multi higgs doublet models ( mhdms ) , the supersymmetric model ( susy ) @xcite are among the possible models carrying an additional cp phase .",
    "the electron edm has been predicted of the order of the magnitude of @xmath7 in the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , including the tree level flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) @xcite and , in this case , the additional cp sources are new complex yukawa couplings . the edms of fermions have been analyzed in @xcite and @xcite , in the 2hdm with the inclusion of non - universal extra dimensions and in the framework of the split fermion scenario .",
    "the edms of quarks were calculated in the mhdms , including the 2hdm in @xcite , the fermion edms in the sm , with the inclusion of non - commutative geometry , have been estimated in @xcite , the lepton edms have been studied in the seesaw model in @xcite , the edms of nuclei , deutron , neutron and some atoms have been predicted extensively in @xcite , limits on the dipole moments of leptons have been analyzed in a left - right symmetric model and in @xmath8 superstring models in @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we analyze the charged lepton edms in the framework of the 2hdm , with the inclusion of a single extra dimension , respecting the randall sundrum ( rs1 ) scenario @xcite .",
    "the extra dimensions are introduced to solve the hierarchy problem between weak and planck scales . in the rs1 model",
    ", the gravity is localized on a 4d boundary , so called hidden ( planck ) brane , and the other fields , including the sm fields , live on another 4d boundary , so called the visible ( tev ) brane . the warp factor that is an exponential function of the compactified radius in the extra dimension drives the difference of induced metrics on these boundaries . with this factor ,",
    "two effective scales , the planck scale @xmath9 and the weak scale @xmath10 , are connected and the hierarchy problem is solved . if the sm fields are accessible to the extra dimension , one obtains a richer phenomenology @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the fermion mass hierarchy can be obtained by considering that the fermions have different locations in the extra dimension and it is induced by the dirac mass term in the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "@xcite is devoted to this hierarchy by considering that the higgs field has an exponential profile around the tev brane and @xcite is devoted to an extensive work on the bulk fields in various multi - brane models .",
    "the different locations of the fermion fields in the extra dimension can ensure the flavor violation ( fv ) and it is carried by the yukawa interactions , coming from the sm higgs - fermion - fermion vertices .",
    "the fermion localization in the rs1 background has been applied to the high precision measurements of top pair production at the ilc @xcite and the various experimental fcnc constraints and the electro weak precision tests for the location parameters of the fermions in the extra dimension are analyzed in @xcite .    here , we study the charged lepton edms in the case that the leptons and gauge fields are accessible to the extra dimension with localized leptons in the rs1 background .",
    "we observe that the @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ; @xmath13 ) reach to the values of the order of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ; @xmath1 ) with the inclusion of the kk modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present edms of charged leptons in the rs1 scenario , in the 2hdm .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions . in appendix section ,",
    "we present how to construct the sm fermions and their kk modes .",
    "the fermion edm arises from the cp violating fermion - fermion - photon effective interaction and , therefore , their experimental and theoretical search ensure considerable information about the nature of the cp violation . in the sm ,",
    "the cp violation is driven by the complex ckm matrix elements in the quark sector and a possible lepton mixing matrix in the lepton sector .",
    "the tiny theoretical values of fermion edms in the sm force one to go beyond and the extension of the higgs sector with fcncs at tree level is one of the possibility in order to enhance their theoretical values . in the present work ,",
    "we consider the 2hdm , which allows the fcnc at tree level with the complex yukawa couplings and @xmath14 . ] . the additional effect coming from the extra dimension(s ) is another possibility to enhance the cp violation and , here , we consider the rs1 scenario with localized charged leptons in the extra dimension .",
    "the rs1 background is curved and the corresponding metric reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 with the bulk curvature constant @xmath17 and the exponential @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , is the warp factor which drives the hierarchy and rescales all mass terms on the visible brane for @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the compactification radius in the extra dimension that is compactified onto @xmath22 orbifold with two boundaries , the hidden ( planck ) brane and the visible ( tev ) brane . in the rs1 model ,",
    "all sm fields live in the visible brane , however , the gravity is accessible to the bulk and it is considered to be localized on the hidden brane . with the assumption that the gauge fields and the fermions are also accessible to the extra dimension , the particle spectrum is extended and the physics becomes richer . in the present work , we consider this scenario with the addition of @xmath23 invariant symmetry , @xmath24 and the combination @xmath25 is odd .",

    "the parameter @xmath38 is responsible for the localization and for @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) it is localized near the hidden ( visible ) brane .",

    ", we assume that the higgs doublet @xmath49 , living on the visible brane , has non - zero vacuum expectation value to ensure the ordinary masses of the gauge fields and the fermions , however , the second doublet , that lies also on the visible brane , has no vacuum expectation value : @xmath50\\ , ; \\phi_{2}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\begin{array}{c c } \\sqrt{2 } h^{+}\\\\ h_1+i h_2 \\end{array}\\right ) \\,\\ , , \\label{choice}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath51 the gauge and @xmath52 invariant higgs potential which spontaneously breaks @xmath53 down to @xmath54 reads : @xmath55 ^ 2 + c_4 [ ( \\phi_1^+ \\phi_1 ) ( \\phi_2^+ \\phi_2)-(\\phi_1^+ \\phi_2)(\\phi_2^+ \\phi_1 ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & c_5 [ re(\\phi_1^+ \\phi_2)]^2 + c_{6 } [ im(\\phi_1^+ \\phi_2)]^2 + c_{7 } \\ , , \\label{potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with constants @xmath56 .",
