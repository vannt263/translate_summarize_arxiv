    "a major goal of colliding heavy - ions at relativistic energies is to heat up a small region of space - time to temperatures as high as are thought to have occurred during the early evolution of the universe , a few microseconds after the big bang  @xcite . in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , such as are currently being explored at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) , the four - volume of hot and dense matter , with temperatures above @xmath0  mev , is on the order of @xmath1  @xmath2 .",
    "the state of strongly interacting matter at such high temperatures ( or density of quanta ) is usually called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite .    the first five years of rhic operations at @xmath3  gev and @xmath4  gev have yielded a vast amount of interesting and sometimes surprising results @xcite , many of which have not yet been fully evaluated or understood by theory .",
    "there exists mounting evidence that rhic has created a hot and dense state of deconfined qcd matter with properties similar to that of an ideal fluid @xcite  this state of matter has been termed the _ strongly interacting quark - gluon - plasma _ ( sqgp ) .",
    "heavy - ion collisions at rhic involve several distinct reaction stages , starting from the two initial ground states of the colliding nuclei , followed by the high density phase in which a sqgp is formed up to the final freeze - out of hadrons .",
    "the central problem in the study of the sqgp is that the deconfined quanta of a sqgp are not directly observable due to the fundamental confining property of the physical qcd vacuum . if we could see free quarks and gluons ( as in ordinary plasmas )",
    "it would be trivial to verify the qcd prediction of the qgp state .",
    "however , nature chooses to hide those constituents within the confines of color neutral composite many body systems  hadrons .",
    "one of the main tasks in relativistic heavy - ion research is to find clear and unambiguous connections between the transient ( partonic ) plasma state and the observable hadronic final state ( for a review on qgp signatures , please see @xcite ) .",
    "one particular approach to this problem is the application of transport theory .",
    "transport theory ultimately aims at casting the entire time evolution of the heavy - ion reaction  from its initial state to freeze - out  into one consistent framework . by tuning the physical parameters of the transport calculation to data one",
    "can then infer from these the properties of the hot and dense qcd matter of the sqgp and compare these to the predictions made by lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) .",
    "relativistic fluid dynamics ( rfd , see e.g. @xcite ) is ideally suited for the _ qgp and hydrodynamic expansion _",
    "reaction phase , but breaks down in the later , dilute , stages of the reaction when the mean free paths of the hadrons become large and flavor degrees of freedom are important .",
    "the most important advantage of rfd is that it directly incorporates an equation of state as input and thus is so far the only dynamical model in which a phase transition can explicitly be incorporated . in the ideal fluid approximation ( i.e. neglecting off - equilibrium effects )  and once an initial condition has been specified ",
    "the eos is the _ only _ input to the equations of motion and relates directly to properties of the matter under consideration .",
    "the hydrodynamic description has been very successful @xcite in describing the collective behavior of soft particle production at rhic .",
    "conventional rfd calculations need to assume a _ freezeout _ temperature at which the hydrodynamic evolution is terminated and a transition from the zero mean - free - path approximation of a hydrodynamic approach to the infinite mean - free - path of free streaming particles takes place .",
    "the freezeout temperature usually is a free parameter which ( within reasonable constraints ) can be fitted to measured hadron spectra .",
    "the reach of rfd can be extended and the problem of having to terminate the calculation at a fixed freezeout temperature can be overcome by combining the rfd calculation with a microscopic hadronic cascade model  this kind of hybrid approach ( dubbed _ hydro plus micro _ ) was pioneered in @xcite and has been now also taken up by other groups @xcite .",
    "its key advantages are that the freezeout now occurs naturally as a result of the microscopic evolution and that flavor degrees of freedom are treated explicitly through the hadronic cross sections of the microscopic transport .",
    "due to the boltzmann equation being the basis of the microscopic calculation in the hadronic phase , viscous corrections for the hadronic phase are by default included in the approach .    here",
    ", we combine the hydrodynamic approach with the microscopic ultra - relativistic quantum - molecular - dynamics ( urqmd ) model @xcite , in order to provide an improved description of the later , purely hadronic stages of the reaction . such hybrid macro / micro transport calculations are to date the most successful approaches for describing the soft physics at rhic .",
    "the biggest advantage of the rfd part of the calculation is that it directly incorporates an equation of state as input - one of its largest limitations is that it requires thermalized initial conditions and one is not able to do an ab - initio calculation .      in the present paper",
    "we shall use a fully three - dimensional hydrodynamic model @xcite for the description of rhic physics , especially focusing on au + au collisions at rhic energies ( @xmath4 gev per nucleon - nucleon pair ) .",
    "our original code for solving the hydrodynamic equations , which based on cartesian coordinates @xcite , has been modified to the description on the coordinate by longitudinal proper time @xmath5 and @xmath6 $ ] , in order to optimize the hydrodynamic expressions for ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .    in hydrodynamic models ,",
    "the starting point is the relativistic hydrodynamic equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy momentum tensor which is given by @xmath9 here @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are energy density , pressure , four velocity and metric tensor , respectively .",

    ", we adopt lagrangian hydrodynamics . in lagrangian hydrodynamics , the coordinates of the individual cells do not remain fixed , but move along the flux of the fluid . in the absence of turbulence during the expansion ,",
    "lagrangian hydrodynamics has several advantages over the conventional eulerian approach :    * computational expediency : a fixed number of cells can be utilized through the entire calculation .",
    "a lagrangian hydrodynamic code can thus easily be employed even at ultra - high energy collisions such as at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) where a large difference of scale exists between the initial state and the final state due to the large gamma factor and rapid expansion of the qcd matter .",
    "* analysis efficiency : the adiabatic path of each volume element of fluid can be traced in the phase diagram , making it possible to directly discuss the effects of the phase transition on physical observables @xcite .",
    "our algorithm for solving the relativistic hydrodynamic equation in 3d is based on the conservation laws for entropy and baryon number .",
    "further details concerning the numerical method can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .      to solve the relativistic hydrodynamic equation ,",
    "an equation of state ( eos ) needs to be specified .",
    "the inclusion of an equation of state as input is one of the biggest advantages of rfd , which is so far the only dynamical model in which a phase transition can explicitly be incorporated . in the ideal fluid approximation ( i.e. neglecting off - equilibrium effects )",
    ", the eos is the _ only _ input to the equations of motion and relates directly to properties of the matter under consideration .",
    "once the eos has been fixed ( e.g. through a lattice - qcd calculation ) a comparison to data can be used to extract information on the initial conditions of the hydrodynamic calculation @xcite .",
    "lattice - qcd ( lqcd ) offers the only rigorous approach for determining the eos of qcd matter .",
    "calculations at vanishing baryon chemical potential suggest that for physical values of the quark masses ( two light ( @xmath20)-quarks and a heavier @xmath21-quark ) the deconfinement transition is a rapid cross - over rather than a first order phase transition with singularities in the bulk thermodynamic observables @xcite . the critical temperature at @xmath22 for the rapid cross over in the ( 2 + 1 ) flavor case was recently predicted to be @xmath23  mev @xcite .    however , many qcd motivated calculations for low temperatures and high baryon densities exhibit a strong first order phase transition ( with a phase coexistence region ) @xcite .",
    "these two limiting cases suggest that there exists a critical point ( second order phase transition ) @xcite at the end point of a line of first order phase transitions .",
    "recently , the exploration of the phase diagram for large temperatures and small , but non - vanishing , values of the baryon chemical potential became possible through the application of novel techniques , such as ferrenberg - swendsen re - weighting @xcite , taylor series expansions @xcite or simulations with an imaginary chemical potential @xcite . although these techniques have allowed for considerable improvements , the location of the critical point in the @xmath24 ",
    "@xmath25 plane still has large theoretical uncertainties , due to the sensitivity to the quark masses and the lattice sizes used in the calculations .",

    ", we use a simple equation of state with the first order phase transition , which will allow us to compare our results to previous hydrodynamic and hybrid calculations employing ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional @xcite and ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional @xcite hydrodynamic models .    above the critical temperature ( @xmath29 mev at @xmath30 mev ) , the thermodynamical quantities are assumed to be determined by a qgp which is dominated by massless @xmath31 quarks and gluons .",
    "the pressure in qgp phase is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is 3 and @xmath34 is the bag constant @xcite . for the hadronic phase we use a hadron gas equation of state with excluded volume correction @xcite . here , the pressure for fermions is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the pressure of ideal hadron gas and @xmath37 is excluded volume of hadrons whose radii are fixed to 0.7 fm . in the low - temperature region",

    "[ bartab ] and  [ mestab ] for a detailed listing ) .",
    "although heavy states are rare in thermodynamical equilibrium , they have a larger entropy per particle than light states , and therefore have considerable impact on the evolution .",

    "due to our use of lagrangian hydrodynamics , grid points move along the flux of the fluid and are not represented by a fixed coordinate - space lattice any more .",

    "@xmath73 is rounded to an integer value since the hadronic transport model described in the next section deals with real particle degrees of freedom .",
    "the distribution  ( [ eq - cf ] ) divided by @xmath73 is used as probability distribution to randomly generate the space - time and momentum - space coordinates for @xmath73 hadrons of species @xmath74 .",

    "the reverse process , absorbing microscopic particles into the hydrodynamic medium is being neglected  it has been shown in @xcite that for rapidly expanding systems these contributions are negligible .",
    "the ensemble of hadrons generated accordingly is then used as initial condition for the microscopic transport model ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) @xcite . the urqmd approach is closely related to hadronic cascade @xcite , vlasov  uehling  uhlenbeck @xcite and ( r)qmd transport models @xcite .",
    "we shall describe here only the part of the model that is important for the application at hand , namely the evolution of an expanding hadron gas in local equilibrium at a temperature of about @xmath79  mev .",
    "the treatment of high - energy hadron - hadron scatterings , as it occurs in the initial stage of ultrarelativistic collisions , is not discussed here .",
    "a complete description of the model and detailed comparisons to experimental data can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the basic degrees of freedom are hadrons modeled as gaussian wave - packets , and strings , which are used to model the fragmentation of high - mass hadronic states via the lund scheme @xcite .",
    "the system evolves as a sequence of binary collisions or @xmath80-body decays of mesons , baryons , and strings .",
    "the real part of the nucleon optical potential , i.e.  a mean - field , can in principle be included in urqmd for the dynamics of baryons ( using a skyrme - type interaction with a hard equation of state ) . however , currently no mean field for mesons ( the most abundant hadrons in our investigation ) are implemented .",
    "therefore , we have not accounted for mean - fields in the equation of motion of the hadrons . to remain consistent ,",
    "mean fields were also not taken into account in the eos on the fluid - dynamical side . otherwise , pressure equality ( at given energy and baryon density )",
    "would be destroyed .",
    "we do not expect large modifications of the results presented here due to the effects of mean fields , since the `` fluid '' is not very dense after hadronization and current experiments at sis and ags only point to strong medium - dependent properties of mesons ( kaons in particular ) for relatively low incident beam energies ( @xmath81  gev / nucleon ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , mean fields will have to be included in the future .",
    "binary collisions are performed in a point - particle sense : two particles collide if their minimum distance @xmath82 , i.e.  the minimum relative distance of the centroids of the gaussians during their motion , in their cm frame fulfills the requirement : @xmath83 the cross section is assumed to be the free cross section of the regarded collision type ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86  ) .",
    "the urqmd collision term contains 53 different baryon species ( including nucleon , delta and hyperon resonances with masses up to 2 gev ) and 24 different meson species ( including strange meson resonances ) , which are supplemented by their corresponding anti - particle and all isospin - projected states .",

    "all hadronic states can be produced in string decays , s - channel collisions or resonance decays .    tabulated and parameterized",
    "experimental cross sections are used when available .",
    "resonance absorption , decays and scattering are handled via the principle of detailed balance . if no experimental information is available , the cross section is either calculated via an one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model or via a modified additive quark model which takes basic phase space properties into account .    in the baryon - baryon sector ,",
    "the total and elastic proton - proton and proton - neutron cross sections are well known @xcite . since",
    "their functional dependence on @xmath87 shows a complicated shape at low energies , urqmd uses a table - lookup for those cross sections .",
    "however , many cross sections involving strange baryons and/or resonances are not well known or even experimentally accessible  for these cross sections the additive quark model is widely used .    as we shall see later , the most important reaction channels in our investigation are meson - meson and meson - baryon elastic scattering and resonance formation .",
    "for example , the total meson - baryon cross section for non - strange particles is given by @xmath88 with the total and partial @xmath89-dependent decay widths @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the full decay width @xmath92 of a resonance is defined as the sum of all partial decay widths and depends on the mass of the excited resonance : @xmath93 the partial decay widths @xmath94 for the decay into the final state with particles @xmath74 and @xmath95 is given by @xmath96 here @xmath97 denotes the pole mass of the resonance , @xmath98 its partial decay width into the channel @xmath74 and @xmath95 at the pole and @xmath99 the decay angular momentum of the final state .",
    "all pole masses and partial decay widths at the pole are taken from the review of particle properties @xcite .",
    "@xmath94 is constructed in such a way that @xmath100 is fulfilled at the pole . in many cases",
    "only crude estimates for @xmath101 are given in @xcite  the partial decay widths must then be fixed by studying exclusive particle production in elementary proton - proton and pion - proton reactions . therefore , e.g. , the total pion - nucleon cross section depends on the pole masses , widths and branching ratios of all @xmath102 and @xmath103 resonances listed in table  [ bartab ] .",
    "resonant meson - meson scattering ( e.g. @xmath104 or @xmath105 ) is treated in the same formalism .    in order to correctly treat equilibrated matter  @xcite ( we repeat that the hadronic matter with which urqmd is being initialized in our approach is in local chemical and thermal equilibrium ) ,",
    "the principle of detailed balance is of great importance .",
    "detailed balance is based on time - reversal invariance of the matrix element of the reaction .",
    "it is most commonly found in textbooks in the form : @xmath106 with @xmath107 denoting the spin - isospin degeneracy factors .",
    "urqmd applies the general principle of detailed balance to the following two process classes :    1 .",
    "resonant meson - meson and meson - baryon interactions : each resonance created via a meson - baryon or a meson - meson annihilation may again decay into the two hadron species which originally formed it .",
    "this symmetry is only violated in the case of three- or four - body decays and string fragmentations , since n - body collisions with ( n@xmath108 ) are not implemented in urqmd .",
    "resonance - nucleon or resonance - resonance interactions : the excitation of baryon - resonances in urqmd is handled via parameterized cross sections which have been fitted to data .",
    "the reverse reactions usually have not been measured - here the principle of detailed balance is applied .",
    "inelastic baryon - resonance de - excitation is the only method in urqmd to absorb mesons ( which are _ bound _ in the resonance ) .",
    "therefore the application of the detailed balance principle is of crucial importance for heavy nucleus - nucleus collisions .    equation  ( [ dbgl3 ] ) , however , is only valid in the case of stable particles with well - defined masses . since in urqmd detailed balance",
    "is applied to reactions involving resonances with finite lifetimes and broad mass distributions , equation  ( [ dbgl3 ] ) has to be modified accordingly . for the case of one incoming resonance the respective modified detailed balance relation has been derived in @xcite . here",
    ", we generalize this expression for up to two resonances in both , the incoming and the outgoing channels .    the differential cross section for the reaction @xmath109",
    "is given by : @xmath110 here the @xmath111 in the @xmath112-function denote four - momenta .",
    "the @xmath112-function ensures that the particles are on mass - shell , i.e. their masses are well - defined .",
    "if the particle , however , has a broad mass distribution , then the @xmath112-function must be substituted by the respective mass distribution ( including an integration over the mass ) : @xmath113 incorporating these modifications into equation  ( [ dbgl3 ] ) and neglecting a possible mass - dependence of the matrix element we obtain : @xmath114 here , @xmath115 indicates the spin of particle @xmath74 and the summation of the clebsch - gordan - coefficients is over the isospin of the outgoing channel only . for the incoming channel , isospin",
    "is treated explicitly .",
    "the summation limits are given by : @xmath116 the integration over the mass distributions of the resonances in equation  ( [ uqmddetbal ] ) has been denoted by the brackets @xmath117 , e.g. @xmath118 with the mass distribution @xmath119 given by a free breit - wigner distribution with a mass - dependent width according to equation  ( [ gammatot ] ) : @xmath120 with @xmath121 and the normalization constant @xmath122 alternatively one can also choose a breit - wigner distribution with a fixed width , the normalization constant then has the value @xmath123 .",
    "the most frequent applications of equation  ( [ uqmddetbal ] ) in urqmd are the processes @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to establish a baseline against which we can later compare the results of our hybrid macro+micro model . in addition",
    "we wish to demonstrate that our novel implementation of the 3 + 1 dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic model , utilizing a lagrangian grid , is capable of reproducing the results of previous hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "many of these previous calculations found in the literature have focused on one or two particular observables  here we wish to conduct a consistent analysis of all relevant single - particle distributions which can be addressed by a hydrodynamic calculation .    in order to obtain qualitative results which are comparable to experimental data , we have to determine the parameters of the initial conditions .",

    "<S> we introduce a combined fully three - dimensional macroscopic / microscopic transport approach employing relativistic 3d - hydrodynamics for the early , dense , deconfined stage of the reaction and a microscopic non - equilibrium model for the later hadronic stage where the equilibrium assumptions are not valid anymore . within this approach </S>",
    "<S> we study the dynamics of hot , bulk qcd matter , which is being created in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is capable of self - consistently calculating the freezeout of the hadronic system , while accounting for the collective flow on the hadronization hypersurface generated by the qgp expansion . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we perform a detailed analysis of the reaction dynamics , hadronic freezeout , and transverse flow . </S>"
