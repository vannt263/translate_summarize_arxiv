    "the class of blazars contains the most extreme agns , characterized by fast variability , high degree of polarization , bright non - thermal continuum extending from radio up to @xmath2-ray energies ( e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "the study of these sources allows us to address several important issues related to the physics of relativistic jets . for these reasons it is of particular importance to obtain information on the high - energy emission of blazars . in this respect",
    "an excellent instrument has been the italian - dutch satellite _ beppo_sax ( boella et al .",
    "in fact the unprecedentely wide band of _ beppo_sax ( from 0.1 to above 100 kev ) is optimal to study the connection between the x - ray and the @xmath3-ray continuum and to disentangle the different emission components .",
    "one can therefore constrain more effectively the physical properties of the emission regions .    in spring 2002 , the performance of _ beppo_sax started to fail . in particular ,",
    "the acquisition of fields too far from the celestial equator became problematic .",
    "therefore , our planned campaign on the bl lac mkn 501 had to be cancelled .",
    "furthermore , the only nfi routinely operated ( because of battery problems ) was the high - energy instrument pds ( 13 - 300 kev ) .",
    "we thus were solicited to investigate the opportunity of observing , in replacement of mkn 501 , blazar sources with celestial locations satisfying the limited pointing capabilities of _ beppo_sax .",
    "the only 2 sources that could be pointed by the satellite at that epoch , and that appeared at the same time promising in view of a pds detection , were : the bl lac 1es0507 - 040 and the luminous flat spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) pks 1229 - 021 .    in the following we present the analysis of the data and the results of the observations ( sect 2 ) and the discussion ( sect 3 ) .",
    "we have performed the reduction of pds data with xas using standard prescriptions ( chiappetti et al .",
    "1999 ) inclusive of spike rejection , psa correction , unit - by - unit subtraction of the background spectra taken with the collimator in offset position , and then summing the net spectra of the 4 units with gain equalization and contextual rebinning . in order to derive points for a sed we rebinned the data in some combinations of logarithmic bins and fitted the pds data alone ( see figure  [ pds ] ) with a power law , computing the 90% confidence intervals on the spectral index , and using the correlated value of the normalization .      * 1es0507 - 040 * : this bl lac object was discovered by einstein and was the target of a previous _ beppo_sax observation in a program aimed at studying the spectral properties of a sample of x - ray selected bl lacs ( beckmann et al .",
    "it had been detected also in the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) .    since the pds count rate of the 2002 observation is consistent with that measured in 1999 ( @xmath4 vs @xmath5 cts / s ; see figure  [ pds](_top _ ) for the april 2002 spectrum ) , it is appropriate to fit both observations together , exploiting the larger range observed in 1999 due to the lecs and mecs instruments .",
    "the best fit spectral index for a power law in the range 0.1 - 50 kev with @xmath6 @xmath7 ( frozen at the galactic value ) is @xmath8 ( 1.95 - 2.13 ) .",
    "the pds normalization has been fixed at the canonical value of 0.8@xmath9mecs normalization .",
    "the pds spectral slope is consistent with that at lower energies at 90% confidence , while the flux is about a factor 3 higher .",
    "the global fit is formally acceptable ( @xmath10 with 76 d.o.f . ) due to the low statistical weight of the pds points .",
    "however _ the pds flux is clearly in excess of the fit prediction _ ( see figure  [ 0507 ] ) .",
    "a plausible reason for this excess is that pds data of 1es0507 - 040 are contaminated by the emission from another source present in the large pds field of view ( about 1 deg ) .",
    "an inspection of catalogs shows that three possible contaminant sources are located within 1 deg from 1es0507 - 040 :    the radio source s3 0503 - 04 , located at @xmath111 deg from 1es0507 - 040 , had been identified with a bl lac of unknown redshift , and later shown to have strong emission lines at @xmath12 ( veron 1994 ) .",
    "the radio morphology is compact ( stanghellini et al 1990 ) .",
    "the radio spectrum is flat , thus implying a blazar nature . in the x",
    "- rays the situation is less clear : there is a 3@xmath13 detection with heao a-2 ( della ceca et al .",
    "1990 ) at fluxes @xmath14erg @xmath7 s@xmath15 , but this is not confirmed by the rass data ( @xmath16 few @xmath17 erg @xmath7 s@xmath15 ) . a possibility to account for the large difference between the optical / soft x - ray luminosity and the hard x - ray luminosity is to admit that low frequency radiation is heavily absorbed .",
    "the possible sed is reported in fig .  [ 0503 ] .",
    "further x - ray observations are needed to investigate this interesting possibility .",
    "the other two bright _ rass _ sources in the vicinity of 1es0507 - 040 are identified with g stars ( hd 293857 at 25@xmath18 and hd 32704 at 70@xmath18 ) .",
    "they are unlikely to contribute to the pds unless very peculiar ( indeed hd 293857 is a lithium star , with @xmath19 erg / s ) or binaries .",
    "+    * pks 1229 - 021 * : this is a bright quasar ( z=1.045 ) , detected by egret in the @xmath3-ray and with a steep spectrum ( @xmath20 ) ( hartman et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the optical spectrum shows luminous emission lines ( eg fig .",
    "[ hst ] ) .",
    "we have retrieved from the hst fos archive 2 spectra taken on dec 31 , 1994 with the g190h grating ( 1500 - 2300  ) and one taken on 01 jan , 1995 with the g270h grating ( 2200 - 3300  ) . the spectrum , reported in fig .",
    "[ hst ] , has been corrected for the galactic extinction ( e@xmath21 = 0.032 , schlegel et al .",
    "strong emission lines are detected , corresponding to ly@xmath22 , ly@xmath23 , si iv , c iv .",
    "after removal of the emission lines , a power - law fit of the combined spectra over the 1500 - 3300   range yields an index @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .    in the x - rays",
    "the source has been studied with rosat ( rass ) .",
    "we have constructed the overall sed , shown in figure  [ 1229 ] , using data from the literature and our pds data ( see figure  [ pds ] _ bottom _ ) .",
    "we have reproduced the seds with the synchrotron - ic model of ghisellini , celotti & costamante ( 2002 ) .",
    "we refer to that paper for a full description of the model .",
    "the values of the basic physical parameters are reported in the figure caption .",
    "the last _ beppo_sax observations of blazars confirm the importance of exploring the hard x - ray band in the study of blazars , as initiated by",
    "_ beppo_sax .",
    "the case of 1es 0507 - 040 is more complex , due to a possible contamination in the pds spectrum by another source in the field of view .",
    "the identification of the contaminant is difficult : based on the soft x - ray emission the possible candidates are two active stars and a peculiar radio - loud agn .",
    "future study with _ integral _ and/or",
    "new x - ray data are required to clarify the issue ."
