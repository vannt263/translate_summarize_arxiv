    "<S> we consider a theoretical model for membranes with adhesive receptors , or stickers , that are actively switched between two conformational states . in their ` on'-state , the stickers bind to ligands in an apposing membrane , whereas they do not interact with the ligands in their ` off'-state . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the adhesiveness of the membranes depends sensitively on the rates of the conformational switching process . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence is reflected in a resonance at intermediate switching rates , which can lead to large membrane separations and unbinding . </S>",
    "<S> our results may provide insights into novel mechanisms for the controlled adhesion of biological or biomimetic membranes .    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction _  fluid lipid bilayers are the fundamental building blocks of biological membranes and , as such , have been studied extensively @xcite . as a consequence , many equilibrium properties of lipid membranes are now well understood . however , biological membranes are often out of equilibrium , driven by embedded active components or by the coupling to the dynamic cytoskeleton . </S>",
    "<S> these active processes affect the membrane behavior , e.g.  by enhancing membrane shape fluctuations @xcite or lateral diffusion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of shape fluctuations has been theoretically predicted for membranes with ion pumps as active force centers @xcite , and experimentally verified for giant lipid vesicles with embedded bacteriorhodopsin pumps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other active membrane proteins have been suggested to couple to the local thickness @xcite or curvature @xcite of the membranes .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we consider another type of active membrane process . </S>",
    "<S> the active components embedded in these membranes are adhesion molecules , or ` stickers ' , that can be switched between two states : an ` on'-state in which the stickers interact with a second membrane , and an ` off'-state in which this interaction is negligible ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cartoon ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> an important biological example of actively switched adhesion molecules are integrins . in one of their conformations , </S>",
    "<S> the integrin molecules are extended and can bind to ligands present in an apposing membrane @xcite . in another conformation , </S>",
    "<S> the molecules are bent and , thus , deactivated . </S>",
    "<S> the transitions between these conformations are triggered by signaling cascades in the cells , which typically require energy input , e.g.  _ via _ atp . </S>",
    "<S> in biomimetic applications , conformational transitions of appropriately designed stickers may also be triggered by light @xcite .    in an equilibrium situation , </S>",
    "<S> the adhesiveness of a biomembrane only depends on the concentration and binding energy of the sticker molecules @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show here that the adhesiveness of membranes with active stickers also depends strongly on the switching rates of the stickers .    </S>",
    "<S> _ model _  before considering extended membranes with active stickers , let us first focus on a single sticker . in the simple example shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fourstate ] , the sticker can only attain two different separations from its ligand . </S>",
    "<S> the sticker is within binding range of the ligand at close separation , and out of binding range at a larger separation . at both separations </S>",
    "<S> , the sticker can be in either of its two conformations , ` on ' or ` off ' . in this one - sticker model </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the change in elastic energy of the membrane , which is associated with the change of separation , is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of an ` off'-sticker is then independent of the separation , which implies that the rate for the transition from the larger to closer separation is identical to the transition rate for the reverse process . in the dimensionless units used in this example , the two transition rates are equal to 1 . </S>",
    "<S> an ` on'-sticker , in contrast , gains the dimensionless binding energy @xmath0 when bound to the ligand . if we adopt standard metropolis dynamics , the dimensionless unbinding rate of this sticker is @xmath1 , whereas the rate for the reverse process is 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the transition rates between the ` on'- and ` off'-state . </S>",
    "<S> the rate @xmath2 for switching the sticker on is independent of the membrane separation if we assume that this transition is thermally activated and that the corresponding energy barrier is not affected by the presence of the ligand . </S>",
    "<S> however , the off - rates @xmath3 for a bound sticker and @xmath4 for an unbound sticker in general can be different . in equilibrium , </S>",
    "<S> the transition rates between the states have to obey detailed balance , which implies that the total rate @xmath5 for passing through the four states in a clockwise direction has to be equal to the total rate @xmath6 for the counter - clockwise cycle . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the equilibrium condition @xmath7 .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we will consider a situation in which the stickers are switched off by an active process that violates detailed balance and , thus , the equilibrium condition above . </S>",
    "<S> the active process requires energy input , e.g.  via atp hydrolysis . </S>",
    "<S> the energy that is set free by the hydrolysis of an atp molecule typically is significantly larger than the binding energy of an adhesion molecule . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it seems not unreasonable to assume that the rate of an atp - driven off - switching process is independent of whether the sticker is bound or not . </S>",
    "<S> we then have @xmath8.@xcite at small atp concentration , the ` off'-rate @xmath9 should be proportional to this concentration .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider a simple , discrete model for a membrane with active stickers that interact with ligands in an apposing membrane . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> a ` reference plane ' parallel to the membranes is discretized into a square lattice with lattice spacing @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> at each site @xmath11 , a sticker molecule is present that can be in the state ` on ' ( @xmath12 ) or ` off ' ( @xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sticker distribution within the membrane thus is approximated by a square - lattice distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the conformations of the membranes are described by the local membrane separation @xmath14 at the sticker sites @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the membrane separation is nonnegative since the membranes can not penetrate each other .    </S>",
    "<S> the configurational energy of the membranes at time @xmath15 has the form @xmath16 \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] the first term in this configurational energy represents the bending energy of the membranes . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath17 is the effective bending rigidity of the membranes with rigidities @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the discretized laplace operator @xmath20 captures the local mean curvature of the separation field @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the second term is the time - dependent interaction energy of the membranes . </S>",
    "<S> if the sticker at site @xmath11 is ` on ' at time @xmath15 , then @xmath22 is 1 and the membranes interact with the short - ranged sticker potential @xmath23 . for simplicity , we model the short - ranged sticker interaction by the square - well potential @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 with characteristic binding energy @xmath28 and potential range @xmath29 . to reduce the number of parameters , we use the rescaled separation field @xmath30 in our simulations . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , the rescaled potential range @xmath31 of the stickers has the fixed value @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the model here is simulated via a master equation with discrete time steps @xmath33 . in a time step @xmath33 , </S>",
    "<S> the rescaled separation @xmath34 at each lattice site @xmath11 is shifted to a value @xmath35 with standard metropolis transition probabilities : the ` new ' value @xmath35 is adopted with probability 1 if the ` new ' conformation is lower in energy , and adopted with probability @xmath36 $ ] if the energy @xmath37 of the ` new ' conformation is higher than the energy @xmath38 of the ` old ' conformation . </S>",
    "<S> below , we choose @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a random number between -1 and 1 , and @xmath41 is the step size .    to ensure consistency with versions of the model that are continuous in time @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the sticker interaction energy is averaged over each time step @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> if the sticker was always ` on ' in the interval @xmath33 , the interaction energy is @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> if the sticker was always ` off ' , the interaction energy is 0 . if it was ` on ' during a fraction @xmath43 of the interval @xmath33 , the interaction energy is @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the membrane separation field thus evolves in a stochastic sticker potential that is averaged over the time steps @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ results _  the attractive membrane interaction mediated by the ` on'-stickers acts against a steric repulsion of the membranes caused by shape fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> if the sticker - mediated attraction is weak , the membrane fluctuations will lead to large membrane separations , and eventually to an unbinding of the membranes . </S>",
    "<S> the average membrane separation in the steady state and the location of the unbinding transition therefore reflect the adhesiveness of the membranes . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the adhesiveness should increase with the sticker binding energy @xmath45 and the average fraction of ` on'-stickers @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> however , even for a constant binding energy and a constant fraction of ` on'-stickers , the average membrane separation depends sensitively on the switching rates . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ resonance ] , the average membrane separation in the steady state is shown as a function of the mean switching rate @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of ` on'-sticker is @xmath48 , which implies @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the average membrane separation exhibits a resonance : it is maximal at intermediate switching rates @xmath50 , and considerably smaller at high or low switching rates . </S>",
    "<S> this resonance of the membrane separation can be understood from an associated resonance in the escape rate of a single bound sticker molecule , see appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> the resonance of the membrane separation can lead to a reentrant unbinding transition , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ reentrant ] . for specific values of the fraction @xmath51 and binding energy @xmath45 of ` on'-stickers , the membranes </S>",
    "<S> then first unbind with increasing switching rate @xmath50 , and later rebind . </S>",
    "<S> the unbinding transitions of the active membranes are continuous . at an unbinding point </S>",
    "<S> , the average separation @xmath52 continuously tends to infinity @xcite , and the contact probability @xmath53 , the average fraction of lattice sites with @xmath54 , continuously tends to zero .    </S>",
    "<S> the steady - state phase behavior of the membranes can be characterized by unbinding lines , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ unbinding ] . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance at intermediate switching rates is reflected in minima of the inverse critical binding energy @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> this resonance effect increases with decreasing fraction @xmath51 of ` on'-stickers . in the asymptotic limits of small and large switching rates , </S>",
    "<S> the unbinding behavior of the active membranes can be related to the behavior of ` equilibrium membranes ' . in the limit of small switching rates , </S>",
    "<S> the active membranes are equivalent to membranes with a concentration @xmath51 of stickers with ` permanent ' interaction potential @xmath56 . the effective adhesion potential @xmath57 of such membranes </S>",
    "<S> can be determined exactly by integrating over the stickers degrees of freedom in the partition function @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> close to the unbinding point , this effective potential is given by @xmath58 = x \\exp\\left[-v(z_i)/k_bt\\right ] + 1 -x$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the critical sticker binding energy is @xmath59 +   x - 1 } \\label{smallomega}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the critical binding energy of a homogeneous membrane in a square - well potential with the same rescaled potential range @xmath61 . from monte carlo simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath62 . in the limit of fast sticker switching </S>",

    "<S> _ discussion and conclusions _  </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that active switching processes of stickers can have a strong impact on the separation and unbinding behavior of membranes . </S>",
    "<S> the adhesiveness of an ` equilibrium sticker ' is characterized by its binding energy @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the adhesiveness of an active sticker depends also sensitively on the transition rates of the conformational switching process .    at low switching rates , </S>",
    "<S> a bound sticker can unbind either by ( i ) ` hopping ' out of the potential well , or by ( ii ) diffusing out of the potential range after being switched ` off ' , since the probability for being switched ` on ' in the subsequent time steps is small . </S>",
    "<S> the typical time scales for these processes are ( i ) the intrinsic unbinding time @xmath65 $ ] , and ( ii ) the inverse ` off'-rate @xmath66 . for @xmath67 , the adhesion behavior </S>",
    "<S> is nearly unaffected by the sticker switching . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of the active switching becomes clearly noticable for switching rates with @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> for biological adhesion molecules such as integrins or selectins , the typical dissociation times @xmath69 are of the order of seconds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> switching processes on second or subsecond timescales therefore should allow to control the adhesion behavior of biological or biomimetic membranes .    for a given concentration @xmath51 of ` on'-stickers , </S>",
    "<S> the adhesion strength in our model is minimal at resonant mean switching rates @xmath70 , see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ resonance ] and [ unbinding ] . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic timescale @xmath33 corresponds to the typical relaxation time of membrane segments with linear size @xmath10 , the distance between the stickers . </S>",
    "<S> if hydrodynamic damping dominates , this relaxation time scales as @xmath71 @xcite where @xmath72 is the viscosity of the surrounding solvent . for the typical bending rigidity @xmath73 , an average lateral sticker distance of 180  nm , and the typical value @xmath74 poise for the cytoplam viscosity of a cell </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a relaxation time scale of 0.1  ms . on this length scale , </S>",
    "<S> intermonolayer friction leads to the same estimate for the relaxation time @xcite . </S>",
