    "the present paper is a write - up of the `` radial '' counterpart of some of the results derived in the `` chordal '' setting in the paper @xcite by lawler , schramm and werner .",
    "the goal is to describe the laws of all random sets that satisfy a certain radial conformal restriction property .",
    "let us describe without further ado this property , and the main result of the present paper : consider the unit disc @xmath0 and we fix a boundary point @xmath1 and an interior point the origin .",
    "we will study closed random subsets @xmath2 of @xmath3 such that :    * @xmath2 is connected , @xmath4 is connected , @xmath5 , @xmath6 . * for any closed subset @xmath7 of @xmath3 such that @xmath8 , @xmath9 is simply connected , contains the origin and has 1 on the boundary , the law of @xmath10 conditioned on @xmath11 is equal to to law of @xmath2 where @xmath12 is the conformal map from @xmath9 onto @xmath0 that preserves 1 and the origin ( see figure [ fig::radial_conf_restriction ] ) .",
    "the law of such a set @xmath2 is called a radial restriction measure , by analogy with the chordal restriction measures defined in @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 is the conformal map from @xmath9 onto @xmath0 that preserves 0 and 1 .",
    "conditioned on @xmath11 , @xmath10 has the same law as @xmath2.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the main result of the present paper is the following classification and description of all radial restriction measures .",

    "( characterization ) .",
    "a radial restriction measure is fully characterized by a pair of real numbers @xmath13 such that @xmath14=|\\phi_a'(0)|^{\\alpha}\\phi_a'(1)^{\\beta}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is any closed subset of @xmath3 such that @xmath8 , @xmath9 is simply connected , contains the origin and has 1 on the boundary , and @xmath12 is the conformal map from @xmath9 onto @xmath0 that preserves @xmath15 and @xmath1 .",
    "we denote the corresponding radial restriction measure by @xmath16 .",
    "2 .   ( existence ) .",
    "the measure @xmath16 exists if and only if @xmath17    we shall give an explicit construction of the measures @xmath16 for all these admissible values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the function @xmath20 is ( as could be expected ) the so - called disconnection exponent associated with the half - plane exponent @xmath19 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth observing that @xmath21 and that @xmath22 . in theorem",
    "[ thm::radial_restriction ] , we see that the value of @xmath19 is necessarily positive ( and that therefore @xmath23 ) , but the value of @xmath18 can be negative or positive ( as long as @xmath24 ) , so that @xmath25 can be greater than one ( but of course , the product @xmath26 can not be greater than one which is guaranteed by the condition @xmath27 ) .",
    "this theorem is the counterpart of the classification of chordal restriction measures in @xcite that we shall recall in the next section .",
    "it is worth noticing already that while the class of chordal conformal restriction measures was parametrized by a single parameter @xmath28 , the class of radial restriction samples is somewhat larger as it involves the additional parameter @xmath18 .",
    "this can be rather easily explained by the fact that the radial restriction property is in a sense weaker than the chordal one .",
    "it involves an invariance property of the probability distribution under the action of the semi - group of conformal transformations that preserve both an inner point and a boundary point of the disc . in the chordal case ,",
    "the semi - group of transformations were those maps that preserve two given boundary points ( which is a larger family ) . another way to see",
    "this is that the chordal restriction samples in the upper half - plane are scale - invariant , while the radial ones are nt .",
    "however , and this will be apparent in the latter part of the proof of theorem [ thm::radial_restriction ] , chordal restriction samples of parameter @xmath19 can be viewed as limits of radial ones with parameters @xmath29 ( for all admissible @xmath18 s ) , in the same way as chordal sle can be viewed as the limit of radial sle when the inner point converges to the boundary of the domain .",
    "these results have been discussed and mentioned before , at least partially , in e - mail exchanges , lectures and discussions by a number of mathematicians , including of course lawler , schramm and werner , and also dubdat or gruzberg . in fact , reference 31 . in the paper @xcite written in 2003 by lawler , schramm and werner",

    "i wish to hereby thank greg lawler and wendelin werner for letting me write up the present paper and work out the details of the proofs .",
    "we now briefly recall some background material that will be needed in our proofs , concerning chordal or radial sle and their sle@xmath30 variants , brownian loop - soups as well as chordal restriction measures . when @xmath2 is a subset of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we denote @xmath33 as the set @xmath34 and @xmath35 as the set @xmath36 .",

    "in the limit when @xmath63 ( respectively @xmath64 ) , the process has a limit that is scale - invariant in distribution .",
    "this enables to define the corresponding sle@xmath30 ( referred to as sle@xmath65 or sle@xmath66 to indicate if the force - point is to the right or to the left of the driving point ) from a boundary point of a simply connected domain to another by conformal invariance , just as for ordinary sle@xmath67 .",
    "we now recall briefly some facts from @xcite .",
    "consider the upper half plane @xmath45 and we fix two boundary points @xmath15 and @xmath62 . a ( two - sided ) chordal restriction sample is a closed random subset of @xmath61 such that    * @xmath2 is connected , @xmath4 is simply connected , @xmath68 , and @xmath2 is unbounded . * for any closed subset @xmath7 of @xmath61 such that @xmath69 , @xmath70 is simply connected , @xmath7 is bounded and @xmath71 , the law of @xmath72 conditioned on @xmath11 is equal to the law of @xmath2 where @xmath73 is any given conformal map from @xmath70 onto @xmath45 that preserves 0 and @xmath62 .",

    ", it is proved that the chordal conformal restriction measure @xmath80 exists if and only if @xmath81 .",
    "we would like to make the following remarks that will be relevant for the present paper :    1 .",
    "chordal restriction samples can be defined in any simply connected domain @xmath82 by conformal invariance ( using the fact that their law in @xmath45 is scale - invariant : @xmath2 and @xmath75 have the same law for any fixed positive constant @xmath76 ) .",
    "for instance , if @xmath83 is such a simply connected domain and @xmath84 are two different boundary points , the chordal restriction sample in @xmath83 connecting @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the image of chordal restriction sample in @xmath45 under any given conformal map @xmath87 from @xmath45 onto @xmath83 that sends the pair @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "2 .   in the proof of the construction of these ( two - sided ) chordal restriction samples ,",
    "an important role is played by the related `` right - sided chordal restriction samples '' , that we shall also use at some point in the present paper . these are a closed random subset @xmath2 of @xmath61 such that * @xmath2 is connected , @xmath4 is connected , @xmath90 $ ] . * for any closed subset @xmath7 of @xmath61 such that @xmath69 , @xmath70 is simply connected , @xmath7 is bounded and @xmath91 , the law of @xmath72 conditioned on @xmath11 is equal to the law of @xmath2 where @xmath73 is any conformal map from @xmath70 onto @xmath45 that preserves 0 and @xmath62 . + it is clear that the domain to the left of the right boundary of chordal restriction sample is a right - sided restriction sample .",
    "precisely , suppose @xmath2 is the closure of the union of the domains between @xmath92 and the right boundary of a ( two - sided ) chordal restriction sample , then @xmath2 is a right - sided restriction sample . in fact , there exists a one - parameter family @xmath93 such that @xmath94=\\psi_a'(0)^{\\beta}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the conformal map from @xmath70 onto @xmath45 that preserves 0 and @xmath79 as @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath93 exists if and only if @xmath95 .",
    "we usually ignore the trivial case @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "+ one example of right - sided restriction sample is given by sle@xmath98 : let @xmath53 be such a process in @xmath61 from 0 to @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath2 be the closure of the union of domains between @xmath53 and @xmath92 .",
    "then @xmath2 is a right - sided restriction sample with exponent @xmath99 .",

    "we have just seen the the right boundary of a two - sided restriction sample is an sle@xmath98 process .",
    "it is also possible to describe the conditional law of the left boundary given the right boundary : denote @xmath103 as the domain between @xmath92 and the right boundary of @xmath2 .",
    "then , given this right boundary , the conditional law of the left boundary of @xmath2 is an sle@xmath104 from @xmath15 to @xmath62 in @xmath103 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , we shall _ construct _ our radial restriction samples using the radial analogue of this recipe .",
    "4 .   let @xmath105 be the cut point set of @xmath2 i.e. the set of points @xmath106 in @xmath2 such that @xmath107 is not connected .",
    "note that @xmath105 is the intersection of the right and left boundaries of @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that the right and left boundaries of @xmath2 can be coupled with a gaussian free field as two flow lines , which enables to prove ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.5 ) ) that the hausdorff dimension of @xmath105 is almost surely equal to @xmath108 where @xmath109 , when @xmath110 , whereas @xmath111 almost surely when @xmath112 .",
    "it is possible to describe the half - plane brownian non - intersection exponents @xmath113 in terms of restriction measures .",
    "for instance , consider two independent chordal restriction samples @xmath114 and @xmath115 with exponent @xmath116 respectively .",
    "one can derive that , conditioned on @xmath117 ( viewed as the limit of @xmath118 as @xmath119 ) , the `` inside '' of @xmath120 has the same law as a chordal restriction sample of exponent @xmath121 .",
    "it is possible to use restriction samples in order to describe the law of sle@xmath56 processes as sle@xmath50 processes conditioned not to intersect a chordal restriction sample . for details , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equations ( 9),(10 ) ) .",
    "we now briefly recall some results from @xcite .",
    "it is well known that brownian motion in @xmath31 is conformally invariant .",
    "let us now define for all @xmath122 , the law @xmath123 of the two - dimensional brownian bridge of time - length @xmath124 that starts and ends at @xmath124 and define @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the lebesgue measure in @xmath31 that we view as a measure on _ unrooted _ loops modulo time - reparametrization ( see @xcite ) .",
    "then , @xmath127 inherits a striking conformal invariance property .",
    "more precisely , if for any subset @xmath128 , one defines the brownian loop measure @xmath129 in @xmath130 as the restriction of @xmath127 to the set of loops contained in @xmath130 , then it is shown in @xcite :    * for two domains @xmath131 , @xmath132 restricted to the loops contained in @xmath133 is the same as @xmath134 ( this is a trivial consequence of the definition of these measures ) .",
