    "it has been known that earthquakes @xcite , acoustic emissions in a deformed complex material @xcite , and barkhausen noise in random magnets@xcite exhibit distinctive power - law behaviors .",
    "all these systems possess some disorder and also they are driven by a slowly varying external field . as a simple model of such systems , a random field ising model ( rfim ) @xcite under a slowly varying magnetic field",
    "has been investigated in order to elucidate the essential mechanism of the power - law behaviors . by performing numerical experiments of the rfim under a slowly increasing magnetic field",
    ", it was found that the size distribution of avalanches , each of which represents a spin flipping in a connected region , becomes a power - law function at the critical strength of the disorder @xcite .",
    "then , the critical magnetic field at which the avalanche size becomes a system size is called _ disorder - induced critical point_. since this phenomenon occurs due to the existence of disorder , such power - law behaviors are called _ disorder - induced critical phenomena_.    despite the extensive studies for the critical phenomena , fluctuations of magnetization , which might be the most naive quantity characterizing the criticality , has never been investigated . related to this issue , it has been known that the magnetization as a function of the magnetic field shows the almost discontinuous behavior at the disorder - induced critical point , although the precise determination of the transition type is still a controversy@xcite . from this observation and considering the knowledge of conventional critical phenomena , static fluctuations of magnetization hardly exhibit singular behaviors near the disorder - induced critical point .",
    "these raise a naive question whether the disorder - induced critical point can be characterized in terms of fluctuations of time - dependent magnetization .    in this paper , we present a positive answer to this question . our key idea is to notice the recent extensive studies for critical fluctuations near an ergodicity breaking transition in glassy systems @xcite . here",
    ", we review these studies briefly . as an example , let us consider cooperative behaviors near the transition point in colloidal suspensions . in this system , near the transition point , there exist long - range spatial correlations among movable particles during a time interval @xmath3 , which is chosen as a typical relaxation time . when we introduce an appropriate quantity @xmath4 that indicates the occurrence of large particle displacement at the position @xmath5 during the time interval @xmath6 , a discontinuous jump occurs in @xmath7 accompanied with critical fluctuations of @xmath8 at the ergodicity breaking transition .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath9 characterizes the dynamical event intrinsic to glassy systems .",
    "these results motivate us to study the cooperative behaviors near the disorder - induced critical point of the rfim from the viewpoint of fluctuations of some dynamical events .",
    "in particular , we consider ordering processes of the magnetization from a special initial condition .",
    "we have numerically found that fluctuations of the time - dependent magnetization exhibit a critically divergent behavior near the disorder - induced critical point .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ pre ] , we introduce the random - field ising model and demonstrate its basic behaviors numerically . in sec .",
    "[ result ] , we address the main result of our study . concretely , we present new critical exponents that characterize the phenomena near the disorder - induced critical point .",
    "the final section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider a three - dimensional cubic lattice @xmath10 .",
    "a spin variable @xmath11 is defined at each site @xmath12 .",
    "we study the rfim described by the hamiltonian @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents a nearest - neighbor pair of sites , @xmath15 is a constant external field and the random field @xmath16 obeys a gaussian distribution @xmath17 the time evolution of the spin variables is described by the following rule .",
    "we first choose a site at random .",
    "if the spin flip on the site makes the system energy lower , the sign of the spin variable is changed ; otherwise the spin flip is rejected . at the next step , we choose a site at random again , and repeat the above - mentioned procedure . here , a unit time is given by @xmath18 steps , which is called a monte carlo step per site ( mcs ) .",
    "this time evolution rule is similar to traditional avalanche dynamics such as the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite , but our rule may be closer to standard glauber dynamics . indeed , it corresponds to the metropolis method with the zero temperature",
    ". we should be careful to choose a time evolution rule particularly when we discuss finite temperature cases , but we do not enter a difficult question which time evolution rule is more physical .    here , we review the disorder - induced critical phenomena in the rfim .",
    "let us consider the quasi static change of the external field from @xmath19 to @xmath20 . in this operation with a given @xmath21",
    ", @xmath22 is defined as the special value of @xmath15 ( if it exists ) at which a spin flipping in a region over the whole system first occurs .",
    "then , @xmath23 is defined as the maximum value below which @xmath22 exists .",
    "their actual values were numerically determined as @xmath24 @xcite , which is called disorder - induced critical point .",
    "it was reported that power - law behaviors of the size distribution of avalanches were observed in the quasi static change of the magnetic field when @xmath25 .",
    "such power - law behaviors are called the disorder - induced critical phenomena .    .",

    "[ magnet ] .",
    "it is observed that the magnetization @xmath36 quickly approaches the equilibrium value @xmath37 , which is approximately 1 , from -1 when @xmath15 is sufficiently large and that the ordering process becomes slower for the system with smaller @xmath15 .",
    "note that the equilibrium value @xmath37 is slightly less than @xmath38 because @xmath39 on some sites , whose values are largely negative , prevent the magnetization from approaching 1 .",
    "then , by decreasing @xmath15 further , we find that there is a value below which @xmath36 does not reach the state with the equilibrium value @xmath37 .    in order to quantify this transition",
    ", we consider the quantity @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is chosen as 1000 mcss in our numerical experiments .",
    "we confirmed that the results reported below did not depend on the choice of @xmath42 when @xmath43 mcss .",
    "( the lowest value of @xmath42 depends on the system size . ) on the basis of this , we define the _ frozen phase _ as the state with @xmath44 .",
    "since a discontinuous transition from @xmath37 to @xmath45 is expected to occur at a certain value of @xmath15 in the large size limit , we can replace the exact definition of the frozen phase with an operational one expressed as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 for numerical simplicity .",
    "indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ order ] , the transition becomes sharper when @xmath48 is larger .",
    "therefore we expect that our operational definition provides an accurate determination of the phases in the large size limit .",

    "more precise correspondences with previous phase diagrams reported in refs .",
    "@xcite will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "now , we focus on the behaviors near the disorder - induced critical point @xmath51 . that is , by fixing @xmath21 as @xmath23 , we investigate the system with several values of @xmath15 near @xmath52 .",

    "it should be noted that our study is concerned with _",
    "fluctuations of relaxation events_. although such types of fluctuations of dynamical events have been studied extensively in an ergodicity breaking transition in glassy systems , to our knowledge , there have been no such arguments on statistical properties near the disorder - induced critical point .",

    "it is observed that @xmath0 has a peak at a time @xmath3 and that both @xmath55 and @xmath3 increase when @xmath15 approaches @xmath56 .",
    "based on this observation , we next attempt to extract divergent behaviors of @xmath57 and @xmath3 by using a finite - size scaling analysis .    thus for the systems with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , we measured @xmath61 as a function of @xmath62 .",

    "@xmath27.,width=283 ]    these divergent behaviors observed near the disorder - induced critical point lead us to expect that some spins flip cooperatively around the time @xmath3 . in order to describe the nature of the cooperative phenomena , we attempt to define a spatial correlation length that characterizes it , as carried out in studies on traditional critical phenomena . here",
    ", it should be noted that the magnetization grows around the time @xmath3 . in this paper , for numerical simplicity , we focus on the spin configurations at the time @xmath85 such that @xmath86 for each sample because the magnetization is expected to grow at this time .",
    "we then consider the spatial pattern indicating whether the spin on each site has already flipped by the time @xmath85 .",
    "thus , we measure @xmath87 where @xmath88 represents kronecker s delta . calculating its fourier",

    "obtained for several values of @xmath93 , we find that the fitting @xmath94 is obtained well with @xmath95 , as shown in fig .",
    "this is called the ornstein - zernike form if @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath97 represents the correlation length characterizing the spatial pattern @xmath98 .",
    "now , in the same manner as those for @xmath3 and @xmath57 , we perform a finite - size scaling analysis assuming the form @xmath99 the inset of fig .",
    "[ l ] illustrates that this assumption is reasonable and that @xmath100 obeys the asymptotic relation @xmath101 for large @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) . on the basis of this",
    ", we obtain the critical behavior of the dynamical correlation length : @xmath104 note that the obtained value @xmath103 is close to the value @xmath67 , where @xmath66 is the exponent that characterizes the length scale appearing in the finite - size scaling method .",
    "this coincidence implies that the manner of the divergence for length scales is characterized by a single exponent .",
    "it should be noted that the exponents characterizing the length scale appearing in finite - size scaling analysis for statistical quantities related to avalanches were obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the values of the exponent are close to that of @xmath66 in our study .",
    "the relation among these results will be studied in the future .",
    "one may be afraid that another time evolution rule provides a different result , in particular with regard to the exponent @xmath105 . until now",
    ", we do not understand its dependency , but we conjecture that the value of @xmath106 is not so influenced by the choice of the time evolution rule , because of the consistency with the previous studies .",
    "these will be also studied in the future .",
    "we have presented the power - law divergences ( [ tau : s ] ) , ( [ chi : s ] ) , and ( [ xi : s ] ) near the disorder - induced critical point in the rfim .",
    "we have determined the exponents by using the finite - size scaling method as @xmath80 , @xmath107 and @xmath103 .",
    "these values are regarded as preliminary values and more precise values will be determined by using systems with considerably larger sizes . at present , the accuracy of values is not of primary interest , but the existence of divergent fluctuations of time - dependent magnetization is rather important .",
    "indeed , based on our results , we conclude that the phenomena near the disorder - induced critical point can be captured from the viewpoint of fluctuations of dynamical events . in this sense , the phenomena under consideration have common features with cooperative behavior in glassy and jamming systems .",
    "it is an important future subject whether the values of critical exponents observed near the disorder - induced critical point are related to those in glassy and jamming systems .",
    "last , we introduce a few examples of studies motivated by this conclusion .",
    "the first example is the phase diagram in the @xmath108 space .",
    "since the precise definition of the frozen phase appears to be complicated in the finite temperature case , we just plotted the region @xmath109 as a tentative frozen phase , using a metropolis method . figure [ sketch ] shows a schematic diagram of this phase .",
    "from this figure , one may recall the phase diagram of the jamming transition in granular systems ( see fig . 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite or fig . 4 in ref @xcite ) .",
    "we also expect that a similar type of phase diagram can be obtained when we employ other time evolution rules such as a heat bath method .",
    "thus this resemblance motivates us to study the common aspects between granular systems and the present system .",
    "the second example is related to a theoretical framework .",
    "in addition to extensive analysis on the power - law distribution of avalanches @xcite , it was conjectured that the critical behaviors of avalanches in some spin models with disorder are related to metastable states @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate @xmath0 in such systems .",
    "furthermore , we are interested in conducting a theoretical analysis of our numerical results . since @xmath0 proposed in this paper has never been studied in the rfim , such a theoretical analysis would shed light on a new aspect of the rfim .",
