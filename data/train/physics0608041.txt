    "the dynamics of semiconductor lasers with optical feedback is studied both experimentally and theoretically since almost 30 years ( @xcite , for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the interest for such configuration , commonly encountered in many applications ( e.g , communication in optical fibers , optical data storage , sensing etc ) arises from the rich phenomenology observed , ranging from multistability , bursting , intermittency , irregular and rare drops of the intensity ( low frequency fluctuations ( lff ) ) and transition to developed chaos ( coherence collapse ( cc ) ) .",
    "a complete understanding of the physical mechanisms at the basis of such complex behavior is , however , still lacking .",
    "in particular , the origin of the lff regime is under debate since the very first observations and yet this puzzling problem has not been solved .",
    "their origin was ascribed to stochastic effects  @xcite or to deterministic but chaotic dynamics @xcite , and more recently even to the interplay between regular periodic and quasi - periodic solutions @xcite .",
    "the lff dynamics has been investigated by using several type of emitters , mainly edge - emitting : ranging from longitudinal multimode  @xcite to single - mode dfb  @xcite semiconductor lasers .    from the experimental point of view , a complete characterization of the lff dynamics is quite difficult , because of the very different time - scales involved @xcite . indeed , fast oscillations on the 10-ps range have been observed with streak camera measurements @xcite , representing the fundamental scale on which the system evolves . on the other hand",
    ", the duration of such fast pulsing regime between lff events can be as long as hundreds of nanoseconds or even microseconds . in literature",
    ", the lff dynamics has been experimentally characterized in several manners , starting from a relatively simple statistical analysis of the time separation t between lff@xcite ( relating the average @xmath1 between lff with the pump current ) to hurst exponents for the laser phase dynamics  @xcite .",
    "a widely used theoretical description of the system is the lang - kobayashi model @xcite , introduced in 1980 in the effort to provide a simplified but effective analysis of an edge - emitting semiconductor laser optically coupled with a distant reflector . in the model ,",
    "both the multiple reflections from the mirror ( low coupling ) and the possible multimodal structure of the laser were neglected .",
    "the opportunity to include such effects has been discussed in several papers @xcite , but the model still remains presented as the standard theoretical approach to the system . while most of the phenomenology observed in the different experiments is grab by the model , quite often a more precise or quantitative comparison is obtained at the expense of a choice of parameters far from those actually measured or even not physically plausible .",
    "recently , a new configuration has been proposed and studied , based on a vertical cavity surface laser ( vcsel ) with a polarized optical feedback @xcite .",
    "such a laser is longitudinal single - mode ( due to the very short cavity ) but may support different , high order transverse modes for strong enough pumping current ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the simmetry of the cavity allows also for the possible laser action on two different , linear polarizations selected by the crystal axis .",
    "the dynamics of the vcsel with isotropical optical feedback has been examined experimentally in @xcite and theoretically in @xcite , while the role played by polarized optical feedback has been discussed in @xcite . in particular , the setup used in @xcite employed a polarizer in the feedback arm , in order to couple back only the radiation of one polarizations ; moreover , a suitable range of pump current was chosen , to assure single transverse mode behavior . in such configuration ,",
    "the appearance of lff was reported and characterized . the possibility to control the role of the laser modes in the dynamics in this setup allows for a consistent description via the lk model and therefore for an effective test of its predictions , at variance with similar setup where instead the polarization selection were not used @xcite .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to clarify the origin of the lff dynamics by comparing numerical results obtained by solving the lk equations with experimental measurements done on a vcsel . in particular ,",
    "the parameters employed for the integration of the lk rate equations have been carefully derived from the analysis of the same vcsel employed for the experiments  @xcite .    in sec .",
