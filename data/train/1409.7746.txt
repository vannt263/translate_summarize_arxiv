    "in this paper we study the question of fragility and existence of leafwise intersections of coisotropic submanifolds .",
    "our main result is that leafwise intersections are fragile already for hypersurfaces and need not exist even for @xmath0-small hamiltonians : we construct a closed hypersurface @xmath1 and a sequence of hamiltonians @xmath2 , @xmath0-converging to zero , such that @xmath1 and its images @xmath3 have no leafwise intersections .",
    "this shows , in particular , that some form of the contact type condition on the hypersurface @xmath1 is essential in hofer s theorem , @xcite , stated below and in its generalizations . also , in connection with the recent results from @xcite , we prove that the @xmath0-convergence of hypersurfaces hamiltonian diffeomorphic to each other does not , in general , imply @xmath0-convergence of their characteristic foliations .",
    "let us now discuss our results in more detail and in a broader context .",
    "consider a closed coisotropic submanifold @xmath1 ( e.g. , a hypersurface or a lagrangian submanifold ) of a symplectic manifold @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a compactly supported hamiltonian diffeomorphism of @xmath4 , i.e. , the time - one map of the flow generated by a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "a _ leafwise intersection _ of @xmath1 and @xmath7 is a point @xmath8 , or a pair @xmath9 , such that @xmath10 and moreover @xmath11 and @xmath12 lie on the same leaf of the characteristic foliation of @xmath1 .",
    "thus leafwise intersections are associated with @xmath1 and @xmath13 , and in the pair @xmath9 it is @xmath12 that is actually in @xmath14 .    to the best of the authors knowledge ,",
    "leafwise intersections were first considered in @xcite , and according to a theorem of moser , @xcite , and banyaga , @xcite , leafwise intersections necessarily exist when @xmath1 is a hypersurface and @xmath13 is @xmath15-close to the identity . in fact , this is true for any closed coisotropic submanifold , as is easy to see by applying weinstein s theorem on clean intersections , @xcite , to the graph of the characteristic foliation of @xmath1 near the diagonal ; see @xcite .",
    "moreover , one has the lusternik  schnirelmann and morse type inequalities for the number of leafwise intersections .",
    "recently , moser s theorem was strengthened by ziltener in @xcite , where it was shown that leafwise intersections must exist for any closed coisotropic submanifold @xmath1 whenever @xmath13 is the time - one map of a hamiltonian isotopy @xmath16 which is @xmath0-close to @xmath17 or , more generally , when @xmath18 stays @xmath0-close to @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , in this case one still has the lusternik ",
    "schnirelmann ( cup - length ) and morse type multiplicity results .",
    "this result is in some sense sharp since the condition that @xmath13 is close to @xmath17 is clearly necessary unless @xmath1 meets some additional requirements .",
    "chronologically , however , the next crucial step after moser s theorem was a theorem of hofer from @xcite ( see also @xcite ) asserting the existence of leafwise intersections for hypersurfaces in @xmath19 of restricted contact type , provided that @xmath13 has sufficiently small hofer s norm @xmath20 ( here we are assuming that @xmath13 and @xmath21 are compactly supported . )",
    "moreover , in this theorem , the upper bound on @xmath22 is given by a certain homological capacity of the domain bounded by @xmath1 ; see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.9 ) for a symplectic topological treatment of the question .",
    "note also that in @xmath19 leafwise intersections obviously need not exist when @xmath13 is too far from @xmath17 ; for in this case we can easily have @xmath23 .",
    "since then the problem of existence of leafwise intersections has been extensively investigated , and hofer s theorem has been extended to coisotropic submanifolds and to other ambient symplectic manifolds ; see , e.g. , @xcite for an admittedly incomplete but representative list of results on leafwise intersections .",
    "a common feature of these results is that , in contrast with moser s theorem , to ensure the existence of leafwise intersections one has to impose some additional requirements on the hypersurface or the coisotropic submanifold .",
    "this is usually a variant of the contact type condition , but in @xcite leafwise intersections are studied under the assumption that the characteristic foliation is a fibration .",
    "the main result of this paper ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) shows that some assumption on @xmath1 is indeed necessary in hofer s theorem to guarantee the existence of leafwise intersections already when @xmath1 is a closed hypersurface in @xmath19 .",
    "it also shows that in ziltener s theorem one can not replace @xmath0-norm by hofer s norm . to be more specific ,",
    "we construct a closed smooth hypersurface @xmath24 , @xmath0-close to the standard round sphere @xmath25 , and a sequence of autonomous hamiltonians @xmath2 , @xmath0-converging to @xmath26 and supported in the same compact set , such that @xmath1 and @xmath3 have no leafwise intersections for all @xmath27 .",
    "the proof relies heavily on the construction of counterexamples to the hamiltonian seifert conjecture ; see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "note that in theorem [ thm : main ] , the convergence to zero is much stronger than the convergence in hofer s norm and not obviously related to the @xmath0-convergence of the maps @xmath28 .",
    "( apparently , the sequence @xmath28 we constructed does not @xmath0-converge ; by @xcite , it can not @xmath0-converge to @xmath17 . )    regarding the requirements on @xmath1 , there is still a considerable gap between what is currently known for hypersurfaces in @xmath19 and our example .",
    "for instance , it is still not known if leafwise intersections must exist when @xmath1 is a stable ( in the sense of @xcite ) closed hypersurface in @xmath19 and @xmath22 is sufficiently small .",
    "the notion of stability can be extended to coisotropic submanifolds ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) for the original definition and @xcite for a detailed discussion ) , and the question also makes sense for closed coisotropic submanifolds . drawing from the results in @xcite , it seems reasonable to conjecture that the right condition on @xmath1 for the existence of leafwise intersections of @xmath1 and @xmath7 when @xmath22 is small is that the characteristic foliation of @xmath1 is totally geodesic with respect to some metric .",
    "however , as of this writing , this conjecture has far from been proved . without stability ( or the totally geodesic condition ) it is not even known whether a closed coisotropic submanifold @xmath29 with @xmath30 must intersect @xmath7 when @xmath22 is small ; cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our second result concerns a different aspect of coisotropic rigidity .",
    "an important question in the area , stemming from the analogy between coisotropic and lagrangian submanifolds , is whether or not a smooth @xmath0-limit @xmath1 of smooth coisotropic submanifolds @xmath31 must be coisotropic ; cf .",
    "@xcite for the lagrangian counterpart .",
    "no counterexamples are known even in the most general setting , but it is not unreasonable to impose additional requirements on @xmath31 of two types : stability or contact type conditions and that the submanifolds @xmath31 are hamiltonian diffeomorphic to each other . under the latter condition ,",
    "one can also ask , provided that @xmath1 is indeed coisotropic , if the characteristic foliations of @xmath31 converge to the characteristic foliation of @xmath1 . this second question is already of interest",
    "when @xmath31 and @xmath1 are hypersurfaces and hence @xmath1 is automatically coisotropic .",
    "( note also that without the assumption that the hypersurfaces @xmath31 are symplectomorphic , the characteristic foliations need not converge , as is easy to see . )",
    "the answer to both questions is affirmative when hamiltonian diffeomorphisms between @xmath32 and @xmath31 also @xmath0-converge to a homeomorphism ; see @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "we show in theorem [ thm : converge ] that without this convergence assumption or without extra assumptions on @xmath31 the answer to the second question is negative for hypersurfaces .",
    "namely , our proof of theorem [ thm : main ] yields a sequence of hypersurfaces @xmath33 hamiltonian diffeomorphic to each other and @xmath0-converging to the round sphere @xmath34 , but such that the characteristic foliations of @xmath31 do not @xmath0-converge to the characteristic foliation on @xmath35 .",
    "more precisely , there exists a sequence of closed characteristics @xmath36 @xmath37-converging to a simple closed curve in @xmath25 which is nowhere tangent to the characteristic foliation .",
    "furthermore , the characteristic foliation of @xmath31 is not homeomorphic to the characteristic foliation on @xmath25 .",
    "the hypersurfaces @xmath31 are diffeomorphic to @xmath25 but not stable ; see remark [ rmk : stability ] .      before stating the main theorems of the paper ,",
    "let us briefly recall relevant definitions , some of which we have already used in section [ sec : intro ] . let @xmath38 be a symplectic manifold ; this is just the standard symplectic @xmath19 in most of the results considered here . given a hamiltonian @xmath6 , which we will always assume to be compactly supported , we denote the ( time - dependent ) hamiltonian flow of @xmath21 by @xmath39 and the time - one map of this flow by @xmath40 .",
    "( our sign convention for the hamiltonian vector field @xmath41 of @xmath21 is @xmath42 . ) throughout the paper , for the sake of simplicity , all maps and functions are assumed to be @xmath37-smooth unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "furthermore , recall from section [ sec : intro ] that , given a coisotropic submanifold @xmath1 of @xmath4 ( e.g. , a hypersurface ) and a hamiltonian diffeomorphism @xmath5 , a _ leafwise intersection _ of @xmath1 and @xmath7 is a point @xmath43 such that @xmath44 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 lie on the same leaf of the characteristic foliation of @xmath1 .",
    "here @xmath12 , rather than @xmath11 , is actually an intersection of @xmath1 and @xmath7 .",
    "this , however , should cause no problem since @xmath13 gives rise to a one - to - one correspondence between the leafwise intersections @xmath11 and the points @xmath12 .",
    "sometimes we will also refer to the pair @xmath9 as a leafwise intersection .",
    "( although the definitions of leafwise intersections vary between different papers , this one , arguably the most naive , is sufficient for our purposes . )",
    "leafwise intersections of @xmath1 and @xmath7 depend on @xmath1 and the map @xmath13 , but only on the pair of coisotropic submanifolds @xmath1 and @xmath7 .",
    "we refer the reader to , e.g. , @xcite for a general discussion of coisotropic submanifolds in the context of symplectic topology .",
    "the main result of the paper is the following .",
    "[ thm : main ] there exists a closed , smooth hypersurface @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and a sequence of @xmath37-smooth autonomous hamiltonians @xmath47 , supported in the same compact set , such that @xmath1 and @xmath3 have no leafwise intersections .    here the hypersurface @xmath1 can not have contact type by the results of @xcite and , in fact , @xmath1 is not even stable in the sense of @xcite ; see remark [ rmk : stability ] for a proof of this fact .",
    "it readily follows from the proof that @xmath1 can be chosen to be diffeomorphic and arbitrarily @xmath0-close to the round sphere @xmath25 , and the hamiltonians @xmath2 can also be chosen to be supported in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of @xmath25 . to be more precise , for any @xmath48",

    "as has been pointed out above , @xmath28 can not @xmath0-converge to @xmath17 for a fixed  @xmath1 due to the results from @xcite .    as a byproduct of the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] , we obtain the following result .    [",

    "furthermore , the characteristic foliation on @xmath31 is not homeomorphic to the characteristic foliation ( the hopf fibration ) on the sphere @xmath25 .",
    "the first assertion of the theorem should be understood as that the characteristic foliations on @xmath31 do not @xmath0-converge to the characteristic foliation on @xmath25 .",
    "( here we leave aside a somewhat delicate matter of defining @xmath0-convergence of foliations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) further complicated by the fact that in this context @xmath31 are different , although diffeomorphic , manifolds . )",
    "the assumption that the hypersurfaces @xmath31 are hamiltonian diffeomorphic to each other is essential  without it , it is obvious that the characteristic foliations on @xmath31 need not to converge to the characteristic foliation on @xmath1 in any sense .",
    "the proofs of theorems [ thm : main ] and [ thm : converge ] rely heavily on the methods developed to construct counterexamples to the hamiltonian seifert conjecture ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 be the unit sphere in @xmath19 with standard darboux coordinates , say , @xmath53 .",
    "set @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a cut - off function equal to one near @xmath25 .",
    "near @xmath25 , the map @xmath56 is the parallel transport by the vector @xmath57 . for @xmath58 small",
    ", the only leafwise intersections of @xmath25 and @xmath59 are two points @xmath60 on the unit circle @xmath61 in the @xmath62-plane , located near the north and the south poles on @xmath25 .",
    "( the points @xmath63 are the intersections of @xmath61 and the transported circle @xmath64 in @xmath65 . )",
    "let us now insert two symplectic plugs into @xmath25 to interrupt @xmath61 between @xmath66 and @xmath67 and between @xmath68 and @xmath69 as in , e.g. , @xcite ; see fig.[fig : shift ] .",
    "here , however , since our goal is just to break the characteristic @xmath61 , we can use the plugs from @xcite with circular cores .",
    "hence the only dimensional constraint is that @xmath52 .",
    "we choose the plugs narrow and thin , with width much smaller than @xmath70 , located in a very small neighborhood of the intersection of @xmath25 and the plane @xmath71 , and place them in such a way that they are displaced by @xmath56 . as a result , we obtain a new hypersurface @xmath1 which is @xmath0-close to @xmath25 , differs from @xmath25 only within the plugs , and such that the characteristic @xmath61 is broken into several characteristics : one containing @xmath60 and some other containing @xmath63 .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : shift ] . we claim that @xmath1 and @xmath72 have no leafwise intersections .",
    "indeed , the points @xmath60 are no longer leafwise intersections for @xmath1 and @xmath72 , and since the plugs are displaced and due to the plug - symmetry conditions , no new leafwise intersections are created .",
    "applying this construction to a sequence @xmath73 , we obtain a sequence of perturbations @xmath31 of @xmath25 and a sequence of hamiltonians @xmath74 such that @xmath31 and @xmath75 have no leafwise intersections and @xmath76 .",
    "note also that the sequence @xmath31 can be chosen to @xmath0-converge to @xmath25 , and this is essential for the proof of theorem [ thm : converge ] .",
    "so far we have stayed close to the construction from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 7.2 ) .",
    "now a crucial new step is the observation ( proposition [ prop : plugs ] ) that the plugs can be inserted so that all hypersurfaces @xmath31 are hamiltonian diffeomorphic to @xmath77 , i.e. , there exists a sequence of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms @xmath78 such that @xmath79 , and the maps @xmath80 are supported within the same compact set .",
    "( the key point is to find `` arbitrarily thin '' plugs hamiltonian diffeomorphic to a given one .",
    "a hamiltonian diffeomorphism is constructed using moser s method , which ultimately reduces to a variant of a ( singular ) cauchy problem for a first - order pde .",
    "we solve the cauchy problem by the standard method of characteristics , but extra care is needed at this step to account for singularities . )",
    "then the hamiltonians @xmath81 are also supported within the same compact set .",
    "clearly , @xmath3 and @xmath1 have no leafwise intersections , and @xmath82 .",
    "this proves theorem [ thm : main ] and also theorem [ thm : converge ] with @xmath31 taken as the required sequence of hypersurfaces .",
    "this argument is essentially independent of the dimension @xmath83 , and hence here we only detail it for @xmath84 .",
    "the general case can be handled in a similar fashion .",
    "namely , as in other hamiltonian plug constructions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , one takes the product of the lower  dimensional plug @xmath85 described here and the symplectic ball @xmath86 and equips @xmath87 with a @xmath88-invariant `` plug two - form '' standard near the boundary of @xmath87 .",
    "the proof is organized as follows . in section [ sec : plugs ] , we describe the plugs , state proposition [ prop : plugs ] , and derive theorems [ thm : main ] and [ thm : converge ] from the proposition .",
    "proposition [ prop : plugs ] is then proved in section [ sec : pf_plugs ] .",
    "in this section we discuss the construction of a symplectic plug in the setting specifically tailored to the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] ; we refer the reader to , e.g. , @xcite for a treatment of the plugs in a much more general context .",

    "[ lemma : non - deg ] assume that @xmath109 and @xmath110 do not vanish simultaneously , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and that @xmath113 and @xmath114 near @xmath115 .",
    "then @xmath116 is a maximally non - degenerate form on @xmath85 with characteristic vector field @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the hamiltonian vector field of @xmath98 on @xmath119 .",
    "in other words , @xmath120 and @xmath121 and @xmath122 . furthermore , there exists an embedding @xmath123 such that @xmath124 near @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",

    "hence @xmath129 is maximally non - degenerate .",
    "finally , a direct calculation shows that @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",

    "there exist `` trapped '' integral curves , i.e. , the integral curves that enter but do not exit the plug .",
    "the first two assertions and also the last assertion readily follow from the explicit expression for @xmath141 given by .",
    "the third assertion is a straightforward consequence of the fact that , by [ ( p4 ) ] , the reflection in the @xmath144-plane changes the sign of the @xmath145-component of @xmath141 ; see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.2 ) for more details .",
    "when the functions @xmath98 and @xmath97 meet conditions [ ( p1)][(p4 ) ] , we will refer to @xmath85 equipped with the form @xmath116 defined by together with the embedding @xmath128 given by as a _",

    "it readily follows then that the solution @xmath307 is even in @xmath135 , and hence it also vanishes near the upper part of the boundary .",
    "our next step is to show that there exists an @xmath285-dependent hamiltonian @xmath337 on @xmath106 with @xmath338 . in fact",

    "@xmath353 near @xmath125 because @xmath354 and @xmath355 near @xmath125 .",
