    "neutrino oscillations are the only new physics ( np ) beyond the minimal standard model ( sm ) observed to date @xcite ( for recent reviews see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "they can be fully explained introducing rather small neutrino masses @xmath3 and the corresponding ( unitary ) charged current mixing matrix @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the observed pattern of neutrino masses can be implemented , however , in two quite different ways depending on the dirac or majorana character of the neutrinos . in the first case the sm is extended by adding three sm singlets , @xmath5 , to provide dirac masses to the sm neutrinos , @xmath6 , through small yukawa couplings .",
    "alternatively , we can consider extending the sm by adding the only invariant dimension 5 ( weinberg ) operator that can be written using the sm field content @xcite   and @xmath7 are the sm higgs and lepton doublets and @xmath8 , @xmath9 . ] , @xmath10 . in this case",
    "the sm neutrinos acquire majorana masses after electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath11 , and are inversely proportional to @xmath12 , the np scale associated with @xmath13 .",
    "the small neutrino masses then require that the coefficients of this operator be small , either due to a very large np scale or suppressed dimensionless couplings .    both alternatives ( that light neutrinos are dirac or majorana ) , are viable and indistinguishable if @xmath14 is very large , _ except _ for the possible observation of lepton number violation ( lnv ) in neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath0 ) decay @xcite   ( for a recent review see  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the sm extension with dirac neutrino masses preserves lepton number ( ln ) , and hence @xmath0 decay is forbidden . whereas majorana masses carry ln equal two , as does the weinberg operator , and this leads to a non - zero @xmath0 width .",
    "thus , the observation of @xmath0 decay would strongly favor majorana neutrino masses  @xcite ; hence the prime relevance of this type of experiments ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "all this , however , relies on the assumption that both such minimal sm extensions describe the dominating np effects up to very high scales .",
    "we will argue , however , that lnv and neutrino masses may be due to np near the electroweak scale , in which case a much richer set of possibilities can be realized .",
    "the main point we wish to emphasize is that although both @xmath0 decay and majorana neutrino masses do violate ln , they need not be both directly related to the weinberg operator @xmath15 , unlike the above minimal sm extension consisting only of this dimension 5 operator .",
    "for instance , the leading lnv effects in @xmath0 decay could be mediated by an operator involving only _ right - handed _ ( rh ) electrons , such as , for example , @xmath16 which is the lowest - order lnv operator with two rh leptons and invariant under the sm gauge transformations . in this case",
    "@xmath17 ( with the associated majorana masses ) is generated radiatively by @xmath18 at two loops , where the charged leptons suffer a chirality change through mass insertions and are transformed into neutrinos through the exchange of a @xmath19 boson .",
    "this results in a further suppression by two charged lepton masses divided by two powers of the np mass scale , which we do assume to be close to the electroweak scale .",
    "these radiatively - generated majorana masses will produce the usual contribution to @xmath0 decay , which , however , will be negligible compared to the @xmath20 one .    in a companion paper @xcite",
    "we classify the different ways of generating @xmath0 decay and light neutrino masses by the addition of higher order effective operators .",
    "this has been studied in the literature  @xcite , but mostly for operators involving fermions and scalars ; we will concentrate instead on operators involving gauge bosons but not quarks ( thus , for example , excluding _ ab initio _ models with heavy leptoquarks from our analysis ) . here",
    "we will instead provide a realistic testable model realizing the above scenario , where _ ( i ) _ ln is broken at the electroweak scale ; _ ( ii ) _ @xmath0 decay into two rh electrons has a rate of the order of its experimental limit , through the tree - level exchange of new scalars ; and _ ( iii ) _ it contains finite , and therefore calculable , neutrino masses . despite a relatively small number of parameters",
    "this model can also accommodate the observed pattern of neutrino masses and mixings , which are generated at two - loop order ( and whose contribution to @xmath0 decay is in this case negligible ) .",
    "this model is related to others that have been discussed in the literature @xcite , the differences are crucial , and essential in maintaining the 3 features just mentioned ; we discuss these points in detail below .",
    "there are many sm extensions where @xmath0 decay receive new contributions besides those from light majorana neutrino masses ( see @xcite for a general overview ) .",
    "the simplest scenario assumes the presence of heavy majorana neutrinos whose exchange generates new contributions to @xmath0 decay , similar to the ones generated by the light neutrinos .",
    "( see for recent work @xcite . )",
    "other extensions with many more new particles have also been studied ; such as left - right ( lr ) models @xcite and supersymmetric extensions ( see , for instance , for a review @xcite , and references there in ) . in such models",
    "there are several contributions to the @xmath21 decay amplitude , any of which can dominate depending on the region of parameter space being considered .",
    "we are interested , however , in identifying the minimal sm extensions leading to the largest possible contributions to @xmath0 decay and containing no independent neutrino masses .",
    "this means that , as argued above , light neutrino masses only result from the unavoidable contributions mediated by the lnv operators generating @xmath0 decay ; so that the effective lagrangian approach provides the proper language for classifying such scenarios  @xcite . here ,",
    "we are only concerned with giving a specific example of the case where @xmath0 and neutrino masses are generated by the same underlying physics but at different orders in perturbation theory , with the former appearing at tree level , while the latter only at two loops . simple models with finite neutrino masses at two loops have been often discussed in the literature @xcite , although not necessarily related to np inducing @xmath0 decay as it is the case here .",
    "it is worth emphasizing again that the model we study is one particularly simple example of a class of models realizing the above scenario , and that all such models share many phenomenological implications . in our case",
    "the model contains a discrete @xmath22 symmetry , which is spontaneously broken .",
    "this model has the virtue of providing a direct analysis of the symmetries and scales , however , it also has a domain - wall problem  @xcite .",
    "one way of dealing with this problem is to allow the discrete symmetry to remain unbroken , but at the price of generating both neutrino masses and the @xmath0 amplitude at a higher loop order ; a possibility we will not pursue .",
    "we instead discuss related but somewhat more involved models that avoid the domain wall problem while retaining the same low - energy phenomenology .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the most relevant region of parameter space where the @xmath0 decay rate lies within the reach of the next round of experiments . with this assumption , together with the constraints from lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) processes such as @xmath2 , and with the requirement of perturbative unitarity ( or if preferred , naturalness of perturbation theory ) , the model predicts that the neutrino masses obey a normal hierarchy , that the lightest neutrino mass lies in the range @xmath23 , and that the third mixing angle in the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata mixing matrix @xmath4 @xcite obeys @xmath1 .",
    "value which lies well within the sensitivity of ongoing neutrino oscillation experiments . besides",
    ", the new ( charged ) scalar masses can be within the lhc reach , and various lfv processes are predicted to have rates that will be probed when present precision is improved by the next generation of experiments .    in next section",
    "we present our model ; few details on the scalar spectrum and couplings are also worked out , and its relation to other models is briefly discussed .",
    "the reader mainly interested in the phenomenological implications of the model can go directly to section [ sec:0nu2beta ] , where we evaluate the rate for @xmath0 decay .",
    "the requirement that this process can be observed in the next round of experiments , together with perturbativity , translates into upper bounds on the masses of the extra scalars .",
    "these , in turn , result in limits on their couplings if present bounds on lfv processes are to be fulfilled , as we show in section iv .",
    "we calculate the neutrino masses in section [ sec : the neutrino mass ] , where we show that the model can accommodate the observed pattern of neutrino masses and mixings , though it predicts a somewhat small electron neutrino effective mass @xmath24 .",
    "finally , the prospects for the discovery of the extra scalars at lhc are considered in section [ sec : colliders ] . in connection with this",
    "it must be noted that models with extra scalars may allow for a would - be higgs boson more elusive to lhc searches , for it can have further decay channels open  ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "conclusions are drawn in last section . in three appendices",
    "we collect some technical details .",
    "this model only extends the sm higgs sector , in order to allow for scalar couplings to lepton bilinears with non - zero ln . more precisely ,",
    "as we look for separating the origin of neutrino masses from the mechanism mediating @xmath0 decay , we only introduce new scalar couplings to rh charged leptons , ensuring they are the only final state produced in tree - level @xmath0 decay . a simple way to achieve this is to enlarge the higgs sector including , besides the sm scalar doublet @xmath25 of hypercharge 1/2 , a complex scalar singlet @xmath26 of hypercharge 2 , a real ( neutral ) scalar singlet @xmath27 , and an electroweak triplet @xmath28 of hypercharge 1 .",
    "we also impose a @xmath29 symmetry , under which all sm particles and @xmath26 are even while both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are odd , which forbids their coupling to lepton bilinears .",
    "thus , the yukawa lagrangian reads @xmath30 where we can assume @xmath31 to be a @xmath32 diagonal matrix with positive eigenvalues , and @xmath33 a complex symmetric matrix with three of its phases unphysical .",
    "the most general higgs potential consistent with the symmetries is  , @xmath34 or @xmath35 can easily be related to the terms already included by using the fact that for two arbitrary @xmath36 traceless matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "other possible terms are forbidden by the discrete symmetry . ]",
    "@xmath40    \\ , \\label{eq : model.l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where by rephasing the fields we can always choose @xmath41 and @xmath42 real of either sign . for convenience , we will take @xmath41 positive and @xmath42 negative . in terms of charge eigenstates , the fields @xmath28 and @xmath25",
    "are written @xmath43 the singlet @xmath27 is introduced to preserve the discrete symmetry that forbids the scalar triplet from coupling to leptons .",
    "this symmetry is broken spontaneously by the vevs @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "for the phenomenological discussion it is important to note that in the limit of vanishing @xmath31 , lepton number can be defined to only act on @xmath7 ; this is enough to protect neutrinos from getting a majorana mass . while the @xmath46 lepton number , which would forbid @xmath0 decay ( into two @xmath47 ) , is explicitly broken in the scalar potential due to the presence of the @xmath48 and @xmath49 terms .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 decay amplitude will be proportional to all three couplings : @xmath50 in eq . and @xmath41 and @xmath42 in eq .",
    "; whereas neutrino masses will also depend on @xmath31 .",
    "this is one of a class of models with the same low energy physics . in order to understand the common",
    "lnv features it is convenient to consider the above theory , but with @xmath51 complex , and the modifications needed to insure a real lagrangian . in this case",
    "ln is exactly conserved ; if leptons are assigned ln @xmath52 , @xmath26 carries ln equal to @xmath53 , while @xmath54 and @xmath55 both carry ln equal to @xmath56 , so that type ii see - saw yukawa couplings @xmath57 are forbidden .",
    "the vertex @xmath58 , however , is allowed and generated at two loops , providing light neutrinos a finite mass ( which we calculate exactly ) after spontaneous symmetry breaking proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "obviously , this model has a majoron  @xcite because ln , which is a global abelian symmetry , is spontaneously broken .",
    "one can then consider the region of parameter space where such interesting models are phenomenologically viable  , or promote the symmetry to a local one by gauging , for instance , baryon minus lepton number ( b@xmath60l ) .",
    "although , this is an interesting possibility , too , with renewed experimental interest ( see , for instance , for a review @xcite ) , it requires adding rh neutrinos that provide a new potential source of light neutrino masses ; this lies outside the goal of the present investigation that is centered on theories where neutrino masses are generated by the lnv effective operator accounting for @xmath0 decay .    for this reason we have assumed @xmath27 to be real , breaking ln explicitly but leaving as a remnant an exact @xmath22 symmetry .",
    "the general features of the theory remain , though the majoron does not appear and ln is reduced to the above @xmath22 symmetry   parity to the leptons , in which case this discrete symmetry equals @xmath61 . ] .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of this discrete symmetry will generate domain walls .",
    "this poses no problem provided @xmath62 is sufficiently large ( with @xmath63 correspondingly small while keeping their product fixed ) guaranteeing the formation of such defects before the inflationary epoch .",
    "we have assumed instead that @xmath64 is not too large because we prefer avoid requiring @xmath49 unnaturally small ; we may then avoid a domain - wall problem by adding soft - breaking terms , such as @xmath65 to the potential ( such a modification would not require the introduction of tree - level yukawa interactions violating the discrete @xmath22 symmetry ) .",
    "we do not pursue this discussion because within this class of models there is an even simpler one , with the same neutrino physics at low energy , and none of these potential drawbacks .",
    "it is the same model presented above , but with @xmath51 replaced by its vacuum expectation value , @xmath66 ; up to coupling constant redefinition",
    "this yields the same potential as eq .",
    "( [ eq : model.l ] ) without the terms containing @xmath51 , _ except _ for the last term that becomes @xmath67 , with @xmath68 of the order of a tev .",
    "obviously , the resulting renormalizable lagrangian has the same quantum behaviour than ours ; in particular , neutrino masses are finite and generated at two loop order and can be obtained from our results by eliminating @xmath49 using ( [ eq : limit ] ) .",
    "we will prefer to discuss the model including the real scalar field @xmath27 because the perturbative and symmetry analyses appear to be more transparent to us . in the minimal model with the sm addition of only @xmath26 and @xmath28 , and the scalar potential terms relating their ln charges @xmath69 and",
    "@xmath70 the ln of the @xmath28 field is not well defined since the first term requires it to be 1 while the second 0 ( though never 2 ) ; as a consequence the effective vertex @xmath71 , is finite and generated radiatively  , one could also reason differently to justify this result .",
    "indeed , we could assign @xmath27 ln equal to 0 ; then the quartic term @xmath72 fixes the @xmath28 ln also equal to 0 , while the trilinear term @xmath73 breaks ln softly .",
    "in any case the discrete @xmath22 symmetry guarantees that the neutrino masses stay finite . ] . despite the parallels of this discussion with models implementing a type ii see - saw mechanism ( which contain a tree - level @xmath74 coupling )",
    "there is an important difference , namely , that in such theories both the expression for the neutrino masses and the @xmath0 decay amplitude are _ linear _ in @xmath75 ; in contrast the corresponding results in our model are proportional to @xmath76 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon3 ] ) and ( [ eq : nu - mass - matrix ] ) below ) .    the extension of the sm model we consider is related to the one presented in refs .",
    "@xcite as far as particle content is concerned ( we differ by adding the singlet @xmath77 ) . however , the symmetries and quantum number assignments are different , which proves a crucial difference .",
    "had we included the hard term @xmath78 as was done in the above references , @xmath28 should have been assigned ln  @xmath79 ; this would necessitate also including the tree - level coupling @xmath57 that would lead to the usual type ii see - saw scenario .",
    "in particular it would have been inconsistent to assign ln zero to @xmath80 or to arbitrarily exclude this yukawa coupling from the lagrangian , for its coefficient would receive divergent radiative corrections ; in consequence the neutrino masses are not calculable .",
    "if one requires @xmath28 to have ln equal to @xmath81 , as was done in these publications , the quartic coupling @xmath78 must be absent ; but then ln remains unbroken and the light neutrino masses must vanish to all orders which is again inconsistent with the results presented there .",
    "the requirement on the scalar potential of being bounded from below is fulfilled restricting the quartic couplings in eq .   adequately ; these conditions include   is always positive . ]",
    "@xmath82 we have also checked that there is a non - trivial minimum on which the scalar neutral components acquire non - zero expectation values : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , with @xmath86 in appendix [ tripletvev ] we comment on the experimental limit on the scalar triplet vev @xmath87 , which we will find to be of the order of few gev ; to be conservative we will assume @xmath88 , this satisfies @xmath89 where @xmath90 ( derived from eq . and the experimental limit on the @xmath91 parameter , @xmath92  @xcite ) . in this approximation",
    "the minimization conditions can be easily solved : @xmath93 notice that the phase choice @xmath94 is consistent with @xmath95 being real and positive .",
    "we set the @xmath27 and @xmath25 mass squared terms in the higgs potential negative to favour the development of such a minimum .",
    "though we choose the @xmath28 mass squared term positive , this field also acquires a small vev induced by the doublet and singlet vevs , similar to the case observed in see - saw of type ii models @xcite .",
    "the scalar masses can be obtained by substituting eq .   in the potential . using the exact minimization conditions to eliminate @xmath96 and @xmath97 in favour of the vevs , the mass terms for the charged scalars can be written @xmath98 analogously for the neutral sector @xmath99 all eigenvalues of these mass matrices must be positive ( except for the would - be goldstone bosons providing the longitudinal vector boson degrees of freedom ) in order to guarantee that the solution to the minimization conditions corresponds to a local minimum .",
    "this sets further constraints on the model parameters , which can be satisfied rather easily , especially in the limit @xmath100 .",
    "thus , we are left with two massive doubly - charged scalars @xmath101 , @xmath102 with @xmath103 and only one massive , mainly triplet , singly - charged scalar @xmath104 , @xmath105 similarly , there is a neutral scalar @xmath106 with imaginary components , @xmath107 there are also three neutral scalars along the real components @xmath108 .",
    "we will denote these mass eigenfields by @xmath109 ( mainly doublet ) , @xmath110 ( mainly triplet ) and @xmath111 ( mainly singlet ) .",
    "they are obtained rotating the current fields , what introduces other three mixing angles .",
    "notice that in the limit @xmath112 , we have @xmath113 and @xmath114 , with all mixings small .",
    "once the quadratic terms of the lagrangian are diagonalized we can read the interactions for the mass eigenfields . in the following we will need the scalar coupling to rh electrons @xmath115 and the corresponding doubly - charged scalar couplings to gauge bosons @xmath116 as well as their trilinear couplings @xmath117 which can be also expressed in terms of the mass eigenfields using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mixing - doubly][eq : mixing - singly ] ) , and the corresponding vevs in eq .  .",
    "finally , the yukawa coupling changing charge and chirality writes @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the would - be goldstone boson providing the third component to the @xmath19 .",
    "both doubly - charged scalars @xmath120 have components along the singlet @xmath121 and the triplet @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , they ( respectively ) contain couplings to rh electrons and to @xmath19 s , generating an effective vertex @xmath123 that mediates @xmath0 decay . in this section",
    "we calculate this contribution to @xmath0 decay and obtain the explicit constraints on the model parameters derived from the assumption that @xmath0 decay will be observed in the next round of experiments .    assuming that @xmath124 and integrating out the heavy @xmath26 and @xmath28 modes we find , after a straightforward calculation , that the effective lagrangian contains the term @xmath125 as announced in the introduction , and discussed in the companion paper @xcite .",
    "one can better understand the origin of this lnv interaction by considering the contribution of the dominant diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:0nu2beta ] , where the different couplings and vevs involved are displayed explicitly .",
    "the corresponding @xmath123 vertex at low energy ( @xmath126 ) can be written as   decay is proportional to @xmath127 .",

    "in fact , reducing the lower limit will appreciable enlarge the allowed parameter region as discussed below .",
    "thus , the above lower limit together with the requirement of perturbative unitarity ( indicated by the `` pert '' superscript in the inequalities below ) or naturality , which bounds from above the product of couplings and vevs @xmath145 , translate into an upper limit on the product of the scalar masses @xmath146 .",

    "we will show in the next section that in order to obtain neutrino masses in agreement with experiment , the doubly - charged scalar yukawa couplings @xmath173 and the @xmath174 ratio can not be too small .",

    "these additional constraints will hold only within a limited region of the allowed neutrino masses and mixing parameters , which then implies that the type of models under consideration gives rather clear predictions about some of these parameters .    in order to see how this comes about it is useful to go through a straightforward parameter counting exercise :",

    "limits on this type of scalars have been also derived using tevatron data @xcite , leading to a limit @xmath306 ( depending on the details of the model ) .    in our model",
    "the triplet does not directly couple to fermions , while the doubly - charged singlet does not couple to @xmath19 pairs ; however , triplet and singlet mix . of the resulting mass eigenstates one , @xmath307 , is mainly a singlet and decays dominantly to lepton pairs , while the other , @xmath208 , is mainly a triplet and has suppressed couplings to charged leptons . both of them can be produced at lhc via the drell - yan mechanism ( @xmath308 ) with full strength .",
    "since this is the main production process considered by cms , the former limits apply directly to @xmath307 for a non - negligible mixing : @xmath309 .",
    "limits on @xmath310 will be more difficult to obtain since the process @xmath311 is much more complicated to deal with , due to its large backgrounds and the in general difficult reconstruction of several leptonic @xmath19 decays .",

    "this process is a priori decoupled from the light neutrino mass generation , and hence the rate for @xmath0 decay can be large and at the same time the effective electron mass @xmath319 small . despite these differences both types of models have similar low - energy ( below the electroweak scale ) limits or , equivalently , they represent very different uv completions of two similar effective lagrangians at scales below @xmath320 .",
    "a general discussion of the different alternatives using an effective lagrangian approach is presented in a companion paper  @xcite .",
    "the specific model we have discussed is one of a wide class of theories with similar phenomenology .",
    "for example , we choose to break ln explicitly by introducing one neutral scalar singlet ( @xmath27 ) , but , as discussed in section [ sec : the - model ] we could promote @xmath51 to a complex singlet and insure the lagrangian is ln invariant , and this symmetry spontaneously broken ; while the neutrino phenomenology remains similar , it is simpler to discuss in our case . in general , this class of models require several new scalar multiplets to allow for non - vanishing scalar couplings to rh electrons , together with a chain of scalar couplings connecting them to the standard gauge boson triplet , and if desired , to the sm higgs doublet in order to relate the new ln acting on the rh leptons to the ordinary ln associated with lh leptons .",
    "in such cases @xmath0 decay into rh electrons and the light neutrino majorana masses are again related although at different loop order , as in our model .",
    "this model , which we considered in some detail , is based on an extended scalar sector containing three new multiplets : two isosinglets and one isotriplet , the physical spectrum contains two light scalars ( with masses @xmath321 ) and 5 heavy scalars ( with masses @xmath322tev@xmath323 ) : 2 doubly - charged , 1 singly - charged and 2 neutral .",
    "after writing the corresponding scalar potential and showing that there is a region of parameter space allowing for a local minimum along the desired direction , we have elaborated on their low - energy phenomenological implications . in deriving our quantitative predictions",
    "we required for the model to remain perturbative up to several tens of tev .",
    "as repeatedly stressed , the new scalars mediate @xmath0 decay into rh electrons , lfv processes and , at two loops , generate majorana neutrino masses . by requiring @xmath0 decay to be large enough to be observable at the next round of experiments",
    ", we have derived lower bounds on the coupling to rh electrons @xmath185 and upper bounds on the masses of the exchanged scalars . on the other hand ,",
    "the stringent experimental limits on lfv transitions ( particularly @xmath175 and @xmath166 ) translate into upper bounds on the couplings @xmath50 and lower bounds on the masses of the new particles involved , and these create some tension with the assumed @xmath0 decay rate . as a result",
    ", the model predicts that most lfv processes can be within the reach of the next generation of experiments , too .",
    "these same couplings and masses also enter the ( two - loop ) expression for the majorana neutrino masses that have the very characteristic form , @xmath324 , proportional to the scalar couplings to two rh leptons @xmath50 and to the corresponding charged lepton masses @xmath325 .",
    "accommodating the observed neutrino mass spectrum and mixing parameters together with the other constraints is possible , but only for very restricted values of the lightest neutrino mass ( not testable in neutrino oscillation experiments ) , and when the mixing angle @xmath189 is constrained to lie within the preferred 1  @xmath27 range from the global fit in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath326 .",
    "this last prediction also goes far beyond our model , and holds whenever the ( symmetric ) neutrino mass matrix contains three very small entries , for example , @xmath327 , as in our case .",
    "some of these constraints can be alleviated by further extending the scalar sector , although at the price of requiring precise cancellations ( that could be naturally enforced using further symmetries ) .",
    "the model considered presents a simple consistent extension of the sm exhibiting a large @xmath0 decay , but where the contributions to this decay generated by the neutrino majorana masses are negligible .",
    "the neutrino masses themselves are predictable , in contrast with other proposals ( see , for example @xcite ) , and consistent with existing data .",
    "note , however , that although our phenomenological approach and the constraints on the model mainly follow from requiring an observable @xmath0 in the next round of experiments , the non - observation of this decay and even a vanishing decay rate would be compatible with our analysis .",
    "that would be the case for @xmath328 , value which would also ease the lfv restrictions without altering the neutrino mass predictions . as they are obtained assuming that @xmath319 , which is proportional to @xmath185 , too , is to a large extend negligible .",
    "finally , we have also reviewed the collider limits on doubly - charged scalars .",
    "the excellent lhc performance should soon allow for the actual confrontation with the expected masses and couplings for the new scalars in the type of models studied here .",
    "we must , anyhow , be aware that once lhc settles the fate of the sm higgs boson , the mass and couplings of the scalar doublet will be further constrained , implying further restrictions in the scalar potential which must be checked that can be satisfied . at any rate ,",
    "the model studied here is one of a wider class sharing the main assumption in our analysis , that @xmath0 decay is large and decoupled from any mechanism providing tree - level neutrino masses , although the latter are generated through higher - order radiative corrections .",
    "as it is well known , the vev of a triplet with hypercharge @xmath56 gives a tree - level contribution to the @xmath91 parameter , spoiling the successful sm ( tree - level ) prediction @xmath329 .",

    "for instance , in the triplet majoron model  @xcite @xmath344 , with @xmath345 the mass of the doubly - charged scalar , cancelling partially the tree - level contribution .",
    "since these contributions depend on the mass splitting of the triplet components , which in our model is not fixed , we will assume a conservative upper bound @xmath346",
    "the relevant parameter for @xmath0 decay and neutrino masses is the product of couplings and vevs @xmath347",

    "tree - level unitarity at high energy , @xmath348 , in @xmath349 collisions mediated by @xmath101 requires @xmath350 .",
    "similar bounds can be obtained from other channels . in order to be definite",
    ", we will demand @xmath351 tree - level unitarity at high energy does not give useful information on dimensional parameters like @xmath41 because amplitudes involving these couplings decrease with energy .",

    "in fact , one - loop diagrams involving the @xmath48 coupling give contributions to @xmath167 or @xmath171 which are of order @xmath352 .",
    "therefore , it seems appropriate to require @xmath353 limits and also guarantee that the @xmath354 decay width ( to leptons and to @xmath355 , if this is light enough ) is not too large as compared to its mass .    one must be aware , however , that all these limits are estimates which depend on the naturality approach .",

    "( [ eq : gs - ulimit ] ) and ( [ eq : muk - ulimit ] ) in the text to illustrate that the allowed regions in parameter space are at a large extent bounded if the perturbative theory must stay natural .",
    "the evaluation of the complete two - loop contribution to neutrino masses , including @xmath356 effects in a general @xmath357 gauge , is a complicated task .",
    "fortunately , we found a gauge in which the calculation simplifies enormously .",
    "indeed , one can choose a gauge in which triplet and doublet charged scalars do not mix at all ( the gauge - fixing lagrangian is of the form @xmath358 with the constants @xmath359 chosen to cancel the @xmath360 and the @xmath361 mixing terms ) .",
    "in this gauge the charged goldstone boson becomes degenerate with the physical charged scalar ; and @xmath362 does not couple to fermions , whereas @xmath363 does not have derivative couplings to the doubly - charged scalars and gauge bosons .",
    "therefore , the only diagrams contributing to neutrino masses are those depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : numass - w - gauge ] .",
    "( the corresponding feynman rules are obtained redefining the fields in section  [ sec : scalar - spectrum ] adequately ; in particular , in this gauge @xmath364 and @xmath365 . )     gauge .",

    "[ fig : numass - w - gauge],title=\"fig : \" ]    following the notation in eq .",
    "we will have now @xmath366 , where @xmath367 and @xmath368 are the two contributions from the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : numass - w - gauge ] .",
    "they read @xmath369",
    "@xmath370 @xmath371 where in @xmath368 we used the equality @xmath372 ( see section [ sec : the - model ] ) to rewrite @xmath42 in terms of @xmath373 .",
    "note also that both doubly - charged scalar masses must enter symmetrically in the integrals to obtain a non - vanishing contribution .     as a function of the masses @xmath374 and @xmath375 for @xmath376 and @xmath377 .",
    "the cross denotes the reference point in the text .",
    "[ fig : integral - cplot ] ]    we have checked that in the decoupling limit ( @xmath378 and @xmath193 , implying @xmath379 and @xmath380 ) we recover the results obtained in the mass insertion approximation discussed in section  [ sec : the neutrino mass ] . in general @xmath195 is a complicated function of @xmath381 and the ratio @xmath382 , which defines @xmath383 and @xmath384 .",
    "however , since @xmath193 , we can safely neglect the corresponding corrections ( in the limit of large @xmath345 the triplet vev @xmath95 is small , and so is then the mixing of the triplet components with doublets and singlets ; analogously , the contribution of doublet and singlet vevs to the masses of the triplet components can be ignored ) . in this case @xmath195 becomes a function only of @xmath385 and @xmath386 that we compute numerically . in fig .",
    "we plot the contours of constant @xmath195 as a function of the masses @xmath374 and @xmath375 , where we have fixed @xmath376 . from the figure",
    "we see that @xmath195 is order one for a large region of the parameter space . only when @xmath387 there is some suppression .",
