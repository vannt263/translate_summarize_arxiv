    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xmath16 ) were first discovered in a large number by _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ) two decades ago ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1984 ; soifer et al .",
    "these objects are among the most luminous sources in the universe , with most of their energy radiated in the infrared .",
    "although the powering sources of ulirgs remain uncertain , there is evidence that both agns and dusty starbursts contribute to their high bolometric luminosities ( see sanders & mirabel 1996 ; lonsdale , farrah , & smith 2006 for reviews ) .",
    "the majority of local ulirgs are mergers with tidal features commonly seen ( e.g. sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; melnick & mirabel 1990 ; murphy et al .",
    "1996 ) , and distant ulirgs are the possible progenitors of today s massive ellipticals ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "recent large optical photometric surveys show that the color distribution of galaxies are bimodal ( strateva et al . 2001 ; hogg et al .",
    "2003 ; blanton et al . 2003c ;",
    "bell et al .",

    "color - magnitude diagram reveals a red sequence of early type galaxies with little star formation activity , and a blue cloud of late type galaxies that form stars .",
    "the characteristic number density in the standard luminosity function of schechter ( 1976 ) , @xmath17 , has doubled for the red sequence galaxies since @xmath18 , but hardly changes for the blue cloud , implying that the number and stellar mass of the red sequence galaxies have been gradually built up , whereas those of the blue cloud galaxies remain nearly constant ( e.g. , bell et al . 2004b ; faber et al .",
    "one scenario of building up the most massive galaxies in the red sequence is major merging of disk galaxies ( bell et al .",
    "2004b ) , and thus galaxies in the `` green valley '' , the region between the red sequence and blue cloud in the color - magnitude diagram , may represent this transitional type .",
    "as ulirgs are proposed to be disk - disk mergers that will finally evolve to massive ellipticals , studying the color - magnitude relation of ulirgs may shed light on the evolutionary scenarios of building up massive ellipticals .",
    "galaxy morphologies indicate the distribution of baryonic matter in the galaxies , and are therefore tracers of its formation and evolution .",
    "the majority of local ulirgs are merging systems in which disturbed morphologies such as tidal features are commonly observed .",
    "recent deep sky surveys have generated enormous amounts of galaxy imaging data , and automated morphology measurement methods are required to analyze those large datasets with much higher efficiencies than visual inspections provide .",
    "there are two quantitative approaches to describing galaxy morphology : parametric methods and non - parametric methods .",
    "parametric methods fit the light distribution of a galaxy to pre - defined formulae , such as sersic index fitting ( blanton et al . 2003c ) and bulge - to - disk ratio ( peng et al .",
    "2002 ; simard et al .",
    "2002 ) , and are usually inadequate to describe the morphologies of complex systems .",
    "non - parametric methods , such as the concentration , asymmetry , and clumpiness ( cas ) system ( e.g. isserstedt & schindler 1986 ; abraham et al .",
    "1994 ; wu et al . 1999",
    "; conselice et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice 2003 ) , do not rely on pre - defined functions , and may be the better methods for describing complex systems .",
    "abraham et al . ( 2003 ) introduced the @xmath9 coefficient ( @xmath19 ) , which describes the relative intensity distributions of a galaxy .",
    "the @xmath9 coefficient is correlated with concentration and increases with the fraction of light in compact components .",
    "lotz , primack , & madau ( 2004 ; hereafter lpm04 ) introduced @xmath10 , which is the second moment of the brightest 20% of galaxy flux .",
    "@xmath10 is sensitive to spatial distributions of off - axis clumps . @xmath19 and @xmath10 thus should be sensitive to the presence of merger features and indeed lpm04 found that local ulirgs are well separated from normal galaxies in @xmath13 space , in the sense that ulirgs have higher @xmath19 and @xmath10 values than normal galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of color - magnitude analysis and @xmath19 and @xmath10 morphological analysis of 54 ulirgs from the @xmath20 1jy ulirg sample ( kim 1995 ; kim & sanders , 1998 ) that were observed by data release 5 of sloan digital sky survey .",
    "the goals of this paper are to place ulirgs in the context of normal galaxies by comparing their color - magnitude relations and morphologies with those of optically - selected sdss galaxies , and to construct a low - redshift comparison sample for studying high - redshift dusty starbursts , such as spitzer - identified ulirgs and submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) .",
    "the @xmath20 1jy ulirg sample is a complete flux - limited sample from the iras faint source catalog ( moshir et el .",
    "1990 ) with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( kim & sanders 1998 ) .",
    "the sample contains 118 sources with a redshift range between 0.018 and 0.268 and a median redshift of 0.145 .",
    "the infrared luminosities range between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , with a median of @xmath25 .",
    "they are the most ir luminous galaxies in the low redshift universe , and their uniform selection and completeness make them ideal for a statistical analysis .",
    "almost all ulirgs in the sample show visual signs of interactions or mergers , but most are at advanced stages , and the median r - band luminosity is @xmath26 ( kim , veilleux , & sanders 2002 , hereafter kvs02 ; veilleux , kim , & sanders 2002 , hereafter vks02 ) .",
    "spectroscopic study showed that the seyfert fraction increases with infrared luminosity , and @xmath27 of the galaxies with @xmath28 present seyfert characteristics .",
    "these agn - powered ulirgs have bolometric luminosities and near - ir spectra reminiscent of the local quasars .",
    "another @xmath29 of the whole sample are classified as hii - region and @xmath30 are classified as liners , in both of which the energy sources are thought to be stellar origin from recent starbursts ( @xmath31 few times @xmath32 yr ) or shocks ( veilleux , kim & sanders 1999 , hereafter vks99 ; kim , veilleux , and sanders 1998 ) near - ir study using 2mass showed that seyfert galaxies among the 1jy sample have much redder colors and steeper spectral indices in the near - infrared than the rest , which indicates powerful agns as the energy sources ( chen & zhang 2006 ) .",
    "recent @xmath33co ( @xmath34 ) observations of 17 ulirgs in the 1jy sample , along with 12 other local ulirgs showed that their large ir luminosity and gas mass to fir luminosity ratios are consistent with a model where most of their luminosity is powered by a brief surge in star formation rate associated with the rapid gas inflow during the merger phase , although there is also evidence for powerful agns with extreme @xmath35 among a subset and they are possibly transitioning to a quasar phase ( chung et al . 2009 ) .",
    "in general , previous studies suggest an evolutionary sequence of ulirgs in which ulirgs start with cool infrared colors ( @xmath36 ) , go through a warm ulirg state ( @xmath37 ) , and finally evolve to quasars ( sanders 1988 ; vks02 ) .    in  [ sample_selection ]",
    "we present the sample selection .",
    "the image analysis is presented in  [ image_analysis ] .",
    "we present the color magnitude relation of the ulirgs in  [ cmr ] , their morphological analysis in  [ morphology ] , and the summary in  [ summary ] .",
    "we use a @xmath38cdm cosmology with @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 throughout the paper , except for the absolute magnitudes , for which we use @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , for a direct comparison with existing studies .",
    "the sample consists of all the sources from the @xmath20 1jy ulirg sample ( kim 1995 ; kim & sanders 1998 ) that have been imaged in the fifth release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss dr5 ; adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "the sdss is the largest homogeneous , wide - area multiwavelength sky survey available for studying galaxy morphology and color - magnitude distributions in the low redshift universe .",
    "we downloaded sdss dr5 images at the coordinate position of each source in the 1jy ulirg sample , and did a one - by - one comparison with published optical and near - ir images ( kvs02 ) .",
    "this yielded a final sample of 54 ulirgs identified in sdss .",
    "the 54 sources span a redshift range between 0.018 to 0.265 , with a median of 0.151 , and an infrared luminosity range between @xmath23 and @xmath44 with a median of @xmath45 .",
    "the mean values of our sample are very close to those in the whole 1jy sample .",
    "we perform kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) tests between our sample and the whole 1jy sample for the distributions of redshift , infrared luminosity , and infrared colors ( @xmath46 ) , and the probabilities that the two samples are drawn from the same distribution are 80% , 97% , and 99% , for redshift , infrared luminosity , and infrared colors , respectively .",
    "thus we conclude that our sample is a good representative subset of the whole 1jy sample .",
    "the redshifts and the fir luminosities of the sample are presented in the second and third column in table [ tab : sample ] , respectively . there are 14 ulirgs harboring one or more agns according to optical and near - ir spectroscopic study ( vks99 and references therein ) , and they are identified accordingly in table [ tab : sample ] .",
    "the agn sample includes all galaxies with seyfert activity but excludes all liners , which are thought to be low - energy agns ( e.g. krolik 1998 ) .",
    "earlier studies of the 1jy ulirg sample concluded that the agn fraction increases with ir luminosity ( vks99 ; vks02 ) .    the comparison sample we choose for studying the color - magnitude relation is the 436,762 galaxies in the dr4 of the nyu value added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc , dr4 ; blanton et al .",
    "2005 ) with spectroscopic redshifts in the same redshift range of our ulirgs . for studying the morphological parameters , the comparison sample we selected consists of the galaxies that appear on the same sdss images of the ulirgs .",
    "the size of each image is @xmath47 , and there are 1215 , 2059 , 2019 , and 484 comparison galaxies , in the g , r , i , and z band , respectively .",
    "we will discuss the selection method in more detail in ",
    "[ morph.calc ] .",
    "we obtained pipeline - reduced clean images ( _ fpc*.fit _ ) from the sdss dr5 database .",
    "we adopted the skylevels in the observation auxiliary files ( _ tsfield*.fit _ ) and subtracted them from the images .",
    "each image was checked to ensure the soft skyvalue in the header is correct ; for incorrect sky values , we estimated the sky levels based on the statistics of multiple small empty - sky regions on the same image .    a mosaic of rgb color images of all 54 sources is shown in fig .",
    "( refer to the electronic version for the color image ) .",
    "each image is 100 pixels across , or @xmath48 at sdss s pixel scale , and centered on the source .",
    "the color images were prepared using the method described by lupton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ; @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51band background subtracted images as blue , green , and red images , respectively .",
    "the images were smoothed with a median window of 2 pixels wide , aligned using @xmath50band images , and rotated so that north is up .",
    "the relative scales of red , green , and blue images were set to 1:1:2 , in order to emphasize the short wavelength radiation from young stellar populations .",
    "the first visual impression is that the majority of the galaxies show disturbed / irregular morphologies , as well as strong color gradients and discontinuities .",
    "note that there is a smeared three color source on the image of fsc09539 + 0857 .",
    "we checked the sdss moving object catalog ( moc , the third release ; ivezic et al .",
    "2002 ) and found that it is an asteroid with unique sdss moving object i d s1d059 .",
    "the images are arranged according to the @xmath49band @xmath19 and @xmath10 coefficients of each source ( see  [ morphology ] ) , so that for each column @xmath19 increases towards the top , and for each row @xmath10 increases towards the left .",
    "the coefficients were calculated using the method described by lpm04 ( see  [ morph.calc ] ) and are printed on each image . although the images are arranged only relatively in the @xmath13 parameter space , a clear trend is seen : more disturbed and multiple nuclei sources have larger @xmath19 and @xmath10 and are located toward the upper left corner of the mosaic , and the less disturbed sources , with smoother and more symmetric morphology , have smaller @xmath19 and @xmath10 and tend to be located toward the lower right corner .",
    "visual inspection of these images also shows a wide range of morphologies including many close pairs , tidal tails , and otherwise disturbed profiles , in strong support of previous studies and the general view of ulirgs as major mergers of gas - rich disk galaxies .",
    "we computed the magnitude within an elliptical aperture whose semi - major axis is 2 petrosian radii ( petrosian 1976 ) for each source .",
    "the petrosian radius is defined as the radius of a circular aperture on which the mean surface brightness is equal to 20% of the average surface brightness contained inside the aperture .",
    "using an aperture as large as 2 petrosian radii ensures that most low - surface - brightness features are included in the photometry , and the sdss petrosian magnitudes we use to comparison are also obtained within a 2 petrosian radius aperture for each source ( blanton et al .",
    "2001 ; yasuda et al .",
    "2001 ) . for each source",
    ", we align the five images using the @xmath52-band image as the reference .",
    "bilinear interpolation is used during the transformation of each image , and flux is estimated to be conserved within the 0.05% level .",
    "we run @xmath53 ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) on the @xmath52-band image and obtain the aperture whose semi - major axis is 2 petrosian radii , and perform the photometry for all the five bands using the same aperture .",
    "some sources have disconnected multiple components detected by @xmath53 , with each component confirmed to be a part of the ulirg by its redshift based on previous studies ( kvs02 ) . for these sources ,",
    "if the components do not have overlapping apertures , we adopt the total flux from multiple components for photometry ; if they have overlapping apertures , we fit the overlapping region with an ellipse and measure the flux within the ellipse , then subtract it from the total flux to obtain the corrected flux of the entire source .",
    "the airmass and the photometric zero points are obtained from the auxiliary files ( _ tsfield*.fit _ ) and applied when calculating the magnitudes .",
    "the sdss magnitudes were then converted to ab magnitudes using the ab - sdss magnitudes corrections .",
    "we find that for the ulirgs the independently measured apertures are not identical in all five bands .",
    "this is because many ulirgs are extended and amorphous , and the extensions of low surface brightness features can be different at different wavelengths .",
    "the mean relative difference of the petrosian radii measured in @xmath12 and @xmath52 band , @xmath54 , is @xmath55 .",
    "we perform the @xmath49band photometry using the apertures measured in the @xmath12 band , and find that the measured magnitudes are on average 0.03 mag more luminous than the magnitudes measured using the @xmath50band apertures , and the standard deviation of the difference is 0.10 mag . because we use @xmath50band apertures to perform the photometry , we adopt this standard deviation as a typical error of the @xmath3 color for the ulirgs .",
    "our main purpose is to locate the positions of the ulirgs in the color - magnitude diagram , and compare them with the existing survey data .",
    "we therefore adopt the k - corrections to sdss bandpasses shifted to @xmath56 , the median sdss galaxy redshift , employing the _ kcorrect v4.2 _ package developed by blanton et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "each shifted band is denoted by a superscript on the left , e.g. , @xmath57 denotes the sdss @xmath12 band shifted to @xmath56 , and @xmath3 denotes the k - corrected color between two shifted bands , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "galactic extinction is corrected using the sfd98 dust map ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) .",
    "we derive the absolute magnitude by applying the distance modulus to the k - corrected apparent magnitude .",
    "we present the photometry results in table 1 .",
    "in fig . 2 we plot the @xmath3 color against k - corrected @xmath58-band absolute magnitude @xmath2 for all comparison sample galaxies , which consists of the 436,762 galaxies from nyu sdss value added catalog ( dr4 ) within the same redshift range .",
    "individual galaxies are shown as small dots while the contours represent the galaxy number density .",
    "the bimodal distribution of the sdss comparison galaxies is clearly shown in the color - magnitude diagram where the red sequence and the blue cloud form two separate groups .",
    "we adopt the empirical definition of the red sequence from weinmann et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , such that the red - sequence galaxies follow the color - magnitude relations , @xmath59 this relation is shown in fig . 2 where the red sequence lies above the upper straight line .",
    "the centroids of the red sequence and the blue cloud are separated by @xmath60 in @xmath3 , and between the two populations there is a relatively low density region called the `` green valley '' .",
    "we define the green valley as a strip below the red sequence with a width of 0.1 in @xmath3 , shown as the region between the two straight lines in fig .",
    "the fiducial width of 0.1 is chosen to be one third of the color difference between the centroids of the red sequence and the blue cloud , and is also roughly equal to the color difference between the centroid and the blue limit of the red sequence ( the upper straight line ) .",
    "the low density region between the red sequence and the blue cloud is wider at fainter magnitudes and narrower at brighter magnitudes , and our simple cut may miss some green - valley galaxies at fainter magnitudes but include more blue - cloud galaxies at brighter magnitudes .",
    "however , this will not affect our main results as we discuss later .",
    "table [ statistics ] lists the statistics of the colors and magnitudes of the ulirgs and sdss comparison sample and their subsamples .",
    "we summarize below those optical characteristics of the ulirgs and their subsamples ( agn and non - agn ) and compare them with those of the sdss comparison sample .",
    "the first obvious trend is that the ulirgs are very luminous in the optical .",
    "the median k - corrected absolute magnitude is @xmath61 , or equivalently 2.5 @xmath62 given @xmath63 for an @xmath62 galaxy ( blanton 2003b ) .",
    "this is consistent with the median of @xmath64band absolute magnitudes for the whole 1 jy sample ( @xmath65 ; kvs02 ) . for comparison the median k - corrected absolute magnitude of the sdss galaxies",
    "is @xmath66 , which is 1 magnitude fainter than that of the ulirgs .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the ulirgs range from @xmath67 to @xmath68 ( excluding the two saturated sources ) , a luminosity range of a factor of 25 .",
    "fifty out of the 54 ulirgs ( @xmath69 ; including the two saturated sources ) are more luminous than the median k - corrected @xmath50band absolute magnitude of the sdss comparison sample .",
    "the difference in magnitude distribution between the ulirgs and the sdss comparison sample is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ maghist ] .",
    "the ulirg sample has a much narrower distribution than that of the comparison sample .",
    "the ulirgs are on average 1 magnitude brighter than that of the entire comparison sample ( see panel(a ) ) as well as the individual subsample of the red sequence , the green valley , and the blue cloud ( panel ( c ) ) . at the highest luminosity bins the ulirg sample outnumbers all three sdss sub - samples in fraction ( @xmath70 ; panel ( c ) ) .",
    "another striking trend is that the ulirgs are very blue , with only a few exceptions .",
    "their @xmath3 colors span a wide range , from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , and the majority ( 87% ) of the ulirgs have optical colors as blue as those of the blue - cloud galaxies .",
    "the median @xmath3 color of the ulirgs is 0.58 and very close to that of the blue cloud ( 0.55 ) .",
    "the median @xmath3 color of the red sequence and green valley are 0.95 and 0.78 , respectively .",
    "the color distributions of the ulirgs and the sdss galaxies are further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ colorhist](a ) and ( c ) . considering galaxy color as a function of galalxy luminosity , we limit the @xmath52-band absolute magnitudes of the sdss comparison sample to the same magnitude range as that of the ulirgs ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the peak of the ulirg distribution is @xmath74 mag bluer than that of the sdss sample within the same @xmath52-band magnitude range , but very similar to that of the blue cloud within the same @xmath52-band magnitude range ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the ulirgs have a much larger fraction in the bluer bins ( @xmath76 ) than the comparison sample , but a much lower fraction in the redder bins ( @xmath77 ) , except for the reddest bins ( @xmath78 ) and the bluest bins ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the ulirg sample outnumbers the blue - cloud galaxies in fraction at blue colors ( @xmath80 ) , has a similar fraction compared to the green - valley galaxies at green colors ( @xmath81 ) , and has a much lower fraction than the red - sequence galaxies at red colors ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the blue colors of the ulirgs seem inconsistent with the working hypothesis that ulirgs are dusty , massive systems .",
    "however , the patchy mix of blue and red regions in the optical color images ( see color version of fig .",
    "1 ) suggests that the dust extinction is patchy , and the extended distribution of young , blue starts dominate the overall color of these galaxies .",
    "veilleux , sanders & kim ( 1999 ) have discussed the blue optical continuum colors of the ulirgs and suggested that the stellar light suffer less dust extinction than the emission - line gas .",
    "our ulirgs would appear even more luminous and bluer in the optical if corrected for the internal extinction .",
    "the agn ulirgs are among the most luminous sources in the ulirg sample , with a median @xmath83 , 0.8 magnitude more luminous than the median of the non - agn ulirgs .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ maghist](b ) the agn ulirgs are more concentrated toward high luminosities and outnumber the non - agn ulirgs at the highest luminosity bin ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "they also have a much flatter color distribution than the non - agn ulirgs ( see fig .",
    "[ colorhist](b ) ) .",
    "there is little overlap between the agn ulirgs and the green - valley galaxies in both magnitude distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ maghist](d ) ) and color distribution ( see fig . [ colorhist](d ) ) .",
    "we overlay the colors and magnitudes of the ulirg sample on top of the sdss contours in fig .",
    "2 , with different symbols representing ulirgs known to host an agn ( agn ulirgs , circles ) and hii - region like and liner galaxies ( non - agn ulirgs , stars ) .",
    "the images of fsc12540 + 5708 and fsc12265 + 0219 are saturated in the @xmath12 and @xmath52 band , and their magnitudes are shown as upper limits .",
    "the error bar shows @xmath85 , the standard deviation of difference in @xmath49band magnitude measured between @xmath49 and @xmath50band apertures (  [ image_analysis ] ) .",
    "the ulirgs form a distinct group in the color - magnitude diagram : 24 out of the 52 unsaturated ulirgs ( @xmath4 ) lie outside the 90% level contour of the sdss galaxies in the same redshift range .",
    "strikingly , only 3 ( @xmath86 ) lie in the green valley , and none hosts an agn .",
    "the majority of the ulirgs ( 47 out of 54 , or @xmath87 ) are located below the bottom straight line that defines the red limit of the blue cloud , and 4 ( @xmath88 ) are located above the upper straight line that defines the blue limit of the red sequence .    in the local universe",
    "most ulirgs are major mergers of late - type galaxies , and are proposed to be the precursors of massive ellipticals ( e.g. toomre & toomre 1972 ; toomre 1977 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 , 1996 ; barnes & hernquist 1996 ) . given the favorable scenario in which the red sequence is built up by `` wet mergers '' of late - type galaxies ( e.g. bell et al .",
    "2004 , faber et al .",
    "2007 ) , one may expect a concentration of merging galaxies in the green valley , the area connecting the blue cloud and the red sequence in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the low fraction ( 6% ) of our ulirgs in the green valley , however , suggests that most of these ulirgs are not in the transition phase from the blue cloud to the red sequence . instead ,",
    "the majority ( 87% ) of these ulirgs have typical blue - cloud colors , suggesting that they are still undergoing rapid star formation , and the significant quenching of star formation has yet to start .",
    "agns may play a crucial role in quenching star formation and accelerate the transition of blue - cloud galaxies to the red sequence ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "2006 ; croton et al .",
    "indeed , some studies have found an excess of x - ray selected agns in the green valley ( e.g. georgakakis et al .",
    "2008 ; silverman et al . 2008",
    "; hickox et al . 2009 ; schawinski et al .",
    "none of the agn ulirgs in our sample , however , is located in the green valley , and only two ( @xmath89 ) are redder than the blue limit of the red sequence . the remaining 10 ( @xmath90 ) unsaturated sources are bluer than the red limit of the blue cloud .",
    "hickox et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggested an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies with halo masses between @xmath91 , in which a high accretion rate optical- and infrared - bright smg / ulirg / quasar phase evolves quickly ( @xmath92 ) , and is followed by a slightly lower accretion rate `` green - valley '' phase ( lasting @xmath93 1 gyr ) when the objects are detected as x - ray agns .",
    "this phase is followed by an intermittent radio agn phase in which the galaxies reside in the red sequence with lowest accretion rates . in the context of the hickox et al .",
    "study , the majority of our agn ulirgs are still in the early optical - bright phase and have yet to evolve to the green valley .      in the optical bands",
    "the agn ulirgs are among the most luminous in the ulirg sample , and most have blue colors ( see  [ cmr ] ) .",
    "agns are point - like sources residing in the nucleus region and typically have blue optical colors",
    ". thus one may expect the presence of an agn would affect the color and magnitude of the host galaxy ( e.g. hickox et al . 2009 ) .",
    "however our agn ulirgs are low - luminosity seyfert galaxies and the agn emission at optical wavelengths may be highly attenuated . in order to test whether their high luminosity and blue color is due to a central agn we estimate the agn color and luminosity contribution by a simple model fitting .",
    "because the resolution of the images is limited to only @xmath94 ( fwhm , a physical size of @xmath95 kpc at @xmath96 , much larger than the physical size of the nuclear region , we do not try to decompose precisely the central agn and the host galaxy light distribution from each image .",
    "instead we subtract a scaled psf from the nucleus of each galaxy and measure the flux of the scaled psf and compare it with the flux of the host galaxy . as there are few unsaturated field stars on each image",
    ", we adopt the psfs from the sdss archive .",
    "we use two different subtraction methods and obtain a range of the flux for each subtracted scaled psf and the host . in the maximum subtraction method ,",
    "the maximally scaled psf is subtracted from the galaxy image such that the residual is minimized but does not have negative pixels within a psf fwhm size aperture around the center . by using this method",

    "the primary goal of our models is to demonstrate qualitatively the possible evolutionary paths these galaxies may follow on the color - magnitude diagram and to establish the associated timescales .",

    "three symbols are plotted on each track to mark three ages , 1 gyr , 2 gyr , and 5 gyr . in the ssp model , we find that the stellar populations of ulirgs have ages spanning from 200 myr to 8 gyr based on their optical colors , with a median age of @xmath118 gyr .",
    "one exception is the extremely red source fsc11119 + 3257 whose color is too red to be reproduced by the ssp model .",
    "our modeling suggests that a galaxy with a median age takes 1.5 gyr to reach the red sequence . in the constant star formation case ,",
    "the reddest color of the stellar population ( at @xmath117gyr ) is @xmath119 , which is bluer than 80% of the ulirgs .",
    "this implies that in the constant star formation case the star formation has to be quenched in order to move the ulirgs to the red sequence .",
    "next we construct a model with a more complex star formation history and apply different metallicity and dust treatments to try to understand their effects on the color and magnitude .",
    "our model assumes that : ( a ) a ulirg is a merger system consisting of two equal - mass late type galaxies and that the merger triggers a starburst ; ( b ) the star formation history consists of an ssp component associated with each progenitor and an exponentially decaying starburst triggered by the merger ; ( c ) the ssp components are identical with the same age and the starburst is triggered when the ssp components evolve to the median color and magnitude of the ulirgs ; ( d ) the starburst forms as much as 10% of its progenitors stellar mass with an e - folding time of @xmath32 yr .",
    "the timescale of @xmath120 yr is close to the dynamical timescale of ulirgs such as arp 220 ( @xmath121 yr ; mauersberger et al .",

    "although these star formation rates seem extremely high , they are required by the observed high fir luminosities .",
    "we calculate the star formation rate of the ulirgs from their fir luminosities using the fir - sfr relation ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the star formation rates range from 170 @xmath124 to 1370 @xmath124 , with a median of 270 @xmath124 , which are consistent with our model predicted values .",
    "we examine three different metallicities , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 , corresponding to a sub - solar , solar , and super - solar metallicity , respectively , and construct three base models using this star formation history .",
    "we assume that the starburst has the same metallicity as the passively evolved progenitor populations .",
    "we set up a grid of different dust extinctions following charlot & fall ( 2000 ) for each metallicity , but apply the dust extinction only to the starburst population .",
    "there are two parameters in the dust treatment method : the total effective v - band optical depth @xmath128 that affects stars younger than @xmath120 yr , and the fraction @xmath14 of extinction that comes from the diffuse ism and thus affects stars of all ages .",
    "we choose @xmath128 between 1 to 10 with a step size of 1 .",
    "bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) noted that the average value of @xmath14 is 0.3 , and we adopt this value for our modeling .",
    "our choice of optical depth is conservative , based on the common concept that these galaxies are dusty starbursts and/or agns .",
    "however we reiterate that the ulirgs on average are blue and bright , and in order to produce the blue colors the dust attenuation associated with the escaping optical emission has to be modest . as discussed earlier , it is also possible that the geometry of the dust distribution in the system is patchy so that the high infrared luminosity originates from the most dust - attenuated regions , while the optical emission comes from relatively less attenuated regions , e.g. tidal structures at large distances .",
    "we plot nine modeled tracks along with the ulirgs on the color - magnitude diagram in fig .",
    "the tracks start from the time when the starburst is induced .",
    "the three rows of panels show sub - solar , solar , and super - solar metallicity , from top to bottom , respectively . for each metallicity",
    "there are three tracks with @xmath129 , from left to right , respectively .",
    "the tracks are k - corrected to @xmath56 and normalized to the median @xmath2 which is roughly 2.5 @xmath62 .",
    "symbols are plotted on the tracks to mark the age of 1 , 2 , and 5 gyr after the starburst starts .",
    "these tracks clearly suggest that both metallicity and dust extinction play important roles in our understanding of the evolution of these systems .",
    "dust extinction mostly affects the blue optical colors of the systems younger than several hundred million years .",
    "for all metallicities , the stellar populations reach their bluest colors in less than 20 myr , but the bluest color a stellar population can reach becomes increasingly redder with increasing dust extinction .",
    "the blue colors of many ulirgs can be produced only with the lowest dust extinctions .",
    "however , there is almost no color difference between different dust extinctions when the populations are older than 1 gyr and their @xmath3 colors are redder than 0.7 , and any systems with the same metallicity will redden to the red sequence at roughly the same time .",
    "metallicity affects the range of colors and the timescale of the color evolution of the stellar populations , and higher metallicity systems span wider ranges in the color space , and evolve more quickly . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , the bluest ulirgs can be reproduced only by the highest metallicity track . after 20 gyr ,",
    "the super - solar track is 0.25 mag redder than the sub - solar case .",
    "it takes a sub - solar population 2 gyr to evolve to the red sequence , 1.5 gyr for the solar population , and only 1 gyr for the super - solar one .    in reality",
    "the star formation history is almost certainly more complicated than the simple models we discuss here . in the third model we use a simplified version of star formation history produced from numerical simulations of gaseous disk mergers by springel , di matteo , and hernquist ( 2005 ) .",
    "springel et al . used gadget-2 ( springel 2005 ) to trace star formation in a merger of two spiral galaxies and studied the effects of back hole feedback on the quenching of star formation .",
    "the two spiral galaxies have equal dynamical masses of @xmath130 , and form stars at an exponentially decaying rate before the merger , with the pre - merger star formation rate @xmath131 .",
    "the merger - triggered starburst happens at @xmath132 and the peak star formation rate is @xmath133 . in the black hole feedback scenario",
    "the star formation is quenched right after the starburst and the star formation rate decreases to less than 1 @xmath124 at @xmath134 , while in the no feedback scenario the star formation rate decays slowly and remains at several solar masses per year for several gyr .",
    "the intrinsic extinction is ignored in this model .",
    "we plot the evolutionary tracks in fig .",
    "[ evolvtrack ] with the dotted line representing the track without agn feedback and the dashed line representing the one with agn feedback .",
    "three symbols are plotted on each track to mark the ages of 1 , 2 , and 5 gyr .",
    "we find that some of our most luminous ulirgs are located very close to these tracks in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "both tracks evolve more slowly than the ssp track on the same plot because the starburst produces new young blue stars . between the two tracks , the one with agn feedback",
    "clearly reddens more quickly than the one without agn feedback : it takes 8.5 gyr ( or 7 gyr after the starburst ) for the galaxies without agn feedback to evolve to the red sequence , which is 1.5 gyr longer than the one with agn feedback .",
    "the difference in the timescales is consistent with the scenario in which agn feedback quenches the star formation effectively , and consequently helps form the color bimodality of galaxies .    in summary ,",
    "these simple models suggest possible evolutionary paths of the ulirgs on the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "we conclude that constant star forming galaxies can not evolve to the green valley without the star formation quenched .",
    "galaxies with lower star formation activity evolve to the red sequence more quickly and spend shorter time in the green valley , as seen in the ssp model and the numerical simulation model .",
    "dust affects mostly the blue colors of the stellar population , and has almost no influences on the red colors and the timescale of evolution to the red sequence .",
    "stellar population with higher metallicity explores a wider range in the color space , and evolves more quickly to the red sequence .",
    "the color evolution of the ulirgs may be presented by any one of the models with different masses and dust extinctions .",

    "[ evolvtrack ] with ten times more mass ; the evolutionary track of a ulirg with the median color and magnitude may be presented by the numerical simulation models with 90% of the optical emission being attenuated .",

    "there is no significant difference between the mean @xmath19 ( @xmath175 ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath176 ) for the agn ulirgs and non - agn ulirgs : for agn ulirgs , @xmath175 is 0.58 , 0.57 , 0.59 , 0.58 , and @xmath176 is -1.48 , -1.48 , -1.36 , -1.48 , in @xmath12 , @xmath52 , @xmath155 , and @xmath103 band , respectively ; in comparison , @xmath175 is 0.54 , 0.54 , 0.56 , 0.53 , and @xmath176 is -1.42 , -1.45 , -1.49 , -1.42 for non - agn ulirgs in the same bands .",
    "our visual inspection shows that almost all the ulirgs are disturbed systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , and this is consistent with the visual classifications by vks02 , who found that all but one of the 118 @xmath20 1jy sample show visual merger features .",
    "we perform the @xmath13 analysis and find that more disturbed galaxies do have higher @xmath19 and @xmath10 coefficients .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where more disturbed galaxies tend to occupy the upper left corner of the mosaic with higher values of both @xmath19 and @xmath10 .",
    "however our studies also show that ulirgs are a heterogeneous group in @xmath13 space : only slightly less than half of the sources lie above the solid line in each panel of fig .",
    "[ gm20 ] , the region where most local mergers and ulirgs were found by lpm04 .",
    "interestingly , there is only one source located in the early type region , and all the remaining sources fall in the region where irregular and late - type galaxies are located .",
    "this heterogeneous distribution seems to be inconsistent with the result of lpm04 that 80% of local ulirgs are located in the typical merger regions in the parameter space .",
    "however , the spread in the parameter space we found is supported by numerical simulations .",
    "lotz et al .",
    "( 2008b ) analyzed the morphological parameters in sdss @xmath49band images of mergers of equal mass gas - rich spirals by using the n - body / hydrodynamic simulation code gadget ( springel , yoshida , & white 2001 ) and monte carlo radiative transfer code sunrise ( jonsson 2006 ; jonsson et al .",
    "2006 ) , and find that the mergers are most disturbed in @xmath13 at the first pass , but they can have normal galaxies morphologies at other merger stages .",
    "they also noted that two - thirds of the ulirgs in lpm04 exhibit double or multiple nuclei , and therefore are more effectively selected by @xmath13 .",
    "the timescale is only 0.2 @xmath177 0.6 gyr for a merger to appear in the empirical merger region defined by lpm04 , and the range in this time scale depends on dust , orbit parameters , and observing orientations .",
    "thus at face value , our results imply that about half of our ulirgs have been captured within this time window .",
    "the fact that the other half of our ulirgs do not appear in the empirical merger region does not mean that they are not mergers .",
    "instead , they might be in other merger stages when their morphological parameters are consistent with those of normal galaxies .",
    "the heterogeneous picture of our ulirgs thus may represent different evolutionary epochs of the ulirgs .    in order to gain some insights into the @xmath13 morphology",
    "we compare our @xmath12-band @xmath13 classification with the interaction classification for the same sources made by veilleux et al .",
    "veilleux et al .",
    "classified each object into one of the six sequential merging stages according to its morphology .",
    "the comparison of two different classifications is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ morph.comp ] .",
    "we find that all triple mergers by the classification of veilleux et al .",
    "are also classified as mergers by @xmath13 .",
    "sources in their type iiia group , i.e. , wide binary pre - merger systems with apparent separations greater than 10 kpc , are also very likely to be recognized as @xmath13 mergers : @xmath178 of such sources are recognized as mergers using @xmath13 .",
    "sources in their other groups are less likely to be recognized by @xmath13 as mergers , and the fraction of @xmath13 mergers appears to decrease toward later merging stages . we find that @xmath13 mergers make up @xmath179 of the close binary pre mergers ( type iiib ) , @xmath27 of the compact mergers ( type iva ) , @xmath180 of the diffuse mergers ( type ivb ) , and only @xmath181 of the old mergers ( type v ) are @xmath13 mergers , respectively .",
    "sources classified as close binary pre - merger systems ( type iiib ) and old mergers ( type v ) have very large fractions to be recognized as spiral galaxies by @xmath13 ( @xmath182 and @xmath183 , respectively ) .",
    "these comparison results are qualitatively consistent with the simulation results by lotz et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in which the most disturbed @xmath13 morphology happens during the first pass and maximum separation .",
    "however , since our measured morphology is limited by relatively small number statistics and relatively large uncertainties , we do not conclude strongly that the observed morphology can be well explained by the simulations .",
    "we also find that uncertainties in measuring the morphologies contribute significantly to the distribution of the ulirgs in the parameter space .",
    "lpm04 reported that the measurements of @xmath19 and @xmath10 are robust to within 10% when the source has signal - to - noise ratio per pixel @xmath184 greater than 2.5 , the petrosian radius larger than 2.5 times the psf fwhm , and the physical resolution ( parsec per pixel ) higher than 500 @xmath185 .",
    "however when the physical resolution is lower the uncertainties of morphologies largely increase ( fig . 6 in their paper ) since small structures are washed out . at @xmath186",
    "the spatial resolution of the sdss ulirgs is roughly 0.7 - 1.3 @xmath187 and the uncertainties need to be calibrated carefully .",
    "we perform simple simulations to estimate the uncertainties of @xmath19 and @xmath10 for the sdss ulirgs at different noise levels .",
    "we use four model elliptical galaxies , four spiral galaxies selected from sdss images , and three merging galaxies selected from our ulirg sample .",
    "the four elliptical galaxies are modeled using de vacoulers profiles and are added to real sdss images to mimic the observational conditions .",
    "the three spiral galaxies are selected with bright @xmath12-band magnitudes of 13.9 , 15.2 , and 16.4 , respectively , much brighter than the median @xmath12-band magnitudes of the sdss sample ( 18.0 mag ) .",
    "the three ulirgs ( fsc08572 + 3915 , fsc14060 + 2919 , fsc14121 - 0126 ) are selected with bright @xmath12-band magnitudes and unmistakable merger morphology .",
    "the @xmath12-band magnitudes are 16.4 , 16.7 and 17.8 , respectively , all brighter than the median g - band magnitudes of the ulirgs ( 17.8 mag ) .",
    "for each image we generate random noise at a series of different levels , and at each level we generate 20 noise maps independently and add them to the original image .",
    "morphologies , petrosian radius , and @xmath188 are measured for each noise - added source and compared to the original measurements . although our simulation is limited by the sample size , @xmath189 of the noise - added sources selected by the signal - to - noise and size criteria ( @xmath190 and @xmath191 ) have @xmath49band magnitudes between 16 and 19 , and @xmath49band petrosian radii between 3 and 12 arcsec ( @xmath93 6 - 22 kpc at @xmath96 ) , ranges similar to those of the ulirgs .",
    "we find that the measured petrosian radius and the @xmath188 do not always decrease monotonically with the amount of noise added , and they are broadly distributed at low signal - to - noise levels .",
    "we also find that , rather than remaining fixed for a given source , the measured @xmath19 decreases and @xmath10 increases systematically with increasing noise .",
    "therefore when seen against higher background noise , a galaxy tends to move to the lower left corner on the @xmath13 plot .",
    "this effect will decrease the fraction of the mergers observed in the merger region .",
    "the gini coefficient @xmath19 decreases by as much as 0.2 with increasing background noise until the galaxy is no longer detected ( either @xmath192 , or @xmath193 ) , and @xmath10 increases by as much as 0.5 .",
    "the standard deviations of @xmath19 at every noise level are all less than 0.05 , and the spiral galaxies have the smallest dispersions .",
    "the standard deviations of @xmath10 are all less than 0.3 - 0.4 , and the elliptical galaxies have the smallest dispersions .",
    "there is no systematic difference for the uncertainties between different bands .",
    "these uncertainties ( @xmath194 and @xmath195 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ gm20 ] as error bars , and the systematic trend with increasing noise in @xmath19 and @xmath10 is shown as an arrow .",
    "the aperture within which the morphologies are measured is also an important source of uncertainty .",
    "as noted by lisker ( 2008 ) , @xmath19 value measured within larger apertures have systematically larger values , and the measured uncertainties are minimized when the petrosian radius is used as the aperture size .",
    "the reason behind is that more low surface brightness pixels are included within a larger aperture size , which steepens the intensity distribution of the pixels and consequently increases the value of @xmath19 .",
    "some of the low surface brightness features of the source , often at larger distances from the center , are mistakenly excluded when the aperture size is chosen too small , which flattens the pixel intensity distribution and consequently decreases the value of @xmath19 . when assigning pixels to the sources we adopt the surface brightness at the petrosian radius as the threshold , and assign pixels brighter than the threshold to the source .",
    "therefore , according to their study our measured morphologies should have minimized uncertainties , because our apertures should be very close to the petrosian radius and not significantly larger or smaller .      the morphology , color - magnitude relation , and the infrared luminosity of ulirgs present a rather complicated picture of these systems .",
    "the huge infrared luminosity in our ulirgs suggests that their dominant powering sources should be obscured by dust .",
    "however , the majority of them are optically bright and blue .",
    "this further implies that dust is not uniformly distributed and that significant amount of the unobscured stellar light is seen directly .",
    "indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , there are obvious color gradients in the ulirgs , with their tidal features at large distances appearing blue and their central regions appearing red .",
    "lotz et al .",
    "( 2008b ) suggested that merging systems are most disturbed in @xmath13 space and are located in the merger region in the @xmath13 plot during the first pass when the tidal features are prominent .",
    "after the first pass they will move to the late - type and irregular region ( see fig . 5 in their paper ) .",
    "thus we would expect the integrated colors of those disturbed systems selected by @xmath13 to be relatively bluer than the ones with normal @xmath13 relations , due to the blue colors of the tidal features .",
    "recent hydrodynamic simulations of disc - disc mergers also suggested that the infrared luminosity of ulirgs will peak during the final merger when enough metals and dust have been accumulated ( e.g. jonsson et al .",
    "2006 ) , so one would also expect sources with higher infrared luminosity are preferentially found in the late - type and irregular region .",
    "we test these hypotheses by plotting the @xmath49band @xmath9 vs @xmath10 for the ulirgs in fig .",
    "[ other.relation ] , with different symbol sizes representing their fir luminosities and different symbol colors representing their @xmath3 colors .",
    "there are no strong relations between the optical colors and @xmath19 or @xmath10 , except that optically redder sources are slightly more preferentially located in the non - merger regions with lower @xmath19 values .",
    "this is further illustrated in the small panel in the same plot , where we plot the color distributions of sources with @xmath196 , the median @xmath19 of the whole sample , and of sources with @xmath197 .",
    "the sources with lower @xmath19 values tend to distribute toward redder optical colors , although the reddest source has a higher - than - median @xmath19 value ( 0.62 ) .",
    "all agn ulirgs have @xmath19 values greater than 0.5 .",
    "there are no obvious correlations between the fir luminosity and @xmath19 or @xmath10 .",
    "these results are broadly consistent with the scenario that the blue optical colors originate from more disturbed systems , and these systems are not during the phase when the fir emission peaks . however , as mentioned earlier , the uncertainties in measuring @xmath19 and @xmath10 could be substantial , and the measured morphologies are affected by orientation , orbital parameters , viewing angle and dust content ( lotz et al .",
    "we thus do not conclude any strong relations among the morphologies , the fir luminosity , and the optical color of these system .",
    "we present color - magnitude and morphological analysis of 54 ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the sample consists of all the ulirgs from the iras 1jy sample ( kim & sanders , 1998 ) that have been imaged in the data release 5 of sdss , spanning a redshift range from 0.018 to 0.265 with a median redshift of 0.151 .",
    "the main results are :    @xmath198 the ulirgs are a very luminous group of galaxies in the optical , and the majority ( @xmath69 ) are more luminous than the median r - band absolute magnitude of the sdss comparison galaxies in the same redshift range .",
    "@xmath198 the ulirg sample forms a distinct group in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "24 out of the 52 unsaturated ulirgs ( @xmath4 ) lie outside the 90% level contour of the sdss galaxies in the same redshift range ( nyu - vagc , dr4 ; blanton et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the majority of the ulirgs ( @xmath199 ) have typical colors of the blue cloud , only @xmath7 are located in the green valley , and @xmath200 are located in the red sequence , which implies that most of the ulirgs are still undergoing copious star formation .",
    "@xmath198 there are 14 ulirgs known to harbor an agn ( agn ulirgs ) . none of them are located in the green valley .",
    "we use two simple approaches to estimate the point source flux in these systems , and find that on average the central point source contributes less than one - third to the total luminosity in @xmath52 band . the host galaxies do not have a significantly different distribution in the color - magnitude diagram after the point sources removed .    @xmath198 we perform @xmath19 and @xmath10 analysis on the ulirgs and find that their distribution in the @xmath13 space is heterogeneous .",
    "less than @xmath27 ( e.g. @xmath11 in @xmath12 band ) of the ulirgs are located in the merger region found for local ulirgs ( lpm04 ) .",
    "however the heterogeneous distribution is consistent with the morphology produced by numerical simulations ( lotz et al .",
    "2008b ) , and we also discuss the uncertainty in the morphology measurements at the physical resolution of sdss .",
    "@xmath198 we find that the ulirgs have comparable optical luminosity as the sdss qsos within the same redshift range but much redder . in comparison ,",
    "the ulirgs are much more luminous than the sdss type 2 quasars within the same redshift range and much bluer .",
    "the distribution of the sdss type 2 quasars peaks at the green valley .",
    "we perform two - dimensional k - s tests and the results show that the ulirgs , the sdss qsos , and the sdss type 2 quasars are statistically different samples in the color - magnitude two - dimensional space .",
    "@xmath198 we study the relations among morphology , optical color , and far - infrared luminosity of the ulirgs .",
    "these results are broadly consistent with the scenario that the blue optical colors originate from more disturbed systems , and these systems are not during the phase when the far - infrared emission peaks . however , the morphology parameters are affected by the measurement uncertainties , as well as physical properties of the merger .",
    "we thus do not conclude any strong relations among morphology , far - infrared luminosity , and optical color of these system .",
    "selected by their true infrared luminosity with no sed extrapolations , and with the uniformity of the sdss optical photometry , our ulirg sample is a best low - redshift comparison sample to study the color - magnitude relation of high - redshift ulirgs and sub - millimeter galaxies .",
    "although the morphological study of our sample is limited by the physical resolution of sdss , the size and structures of a galaxy might also be smaller at high redshift , and therefore our sample also provides a comparison to study the morphology of high - redshift ulirgs and sub - millimeter galaxies .",

    "<S> they form a group in the color - magnitude diagram distinct from both the red sequence and the blue cloud formed by the sdss galaxies : 24 out of the 52 unsaturated objects ( @xmath4 ) lie outside the 90% level number density contour of the sdss galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the majority ( 47 , or @xmath5 ) have the colors typical of the blue cloud , and only 4 ( @xmath6 ) sources are located in the red sequence . while ulirgs are popularly thought to be precursors to a qso phase , we find few ( 3 or @xmath7 ) in the `` green valley '' where the majority of the x - ray and ir selected agns are found . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , none of the agn - host ulirgs are found in the green valley . </S>",
    "<S> for the 14 previously spectroscopic identified agns ( @xmath8 ) , we perform psf subtractions and find that on average the central point sources contribute less than one third to the total luminosity , and that their high optical luminosities and overall blue colors are apparently the result of star formation activity of the host galaxies . visual inspection of the sdss images reveals a wide range of morphologies including many close pairs , tidal tails , and otherwise disturbed profiles , in strong support of previous studies and the general view of ulirgs as major mergers of gas - rich disk galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed morphology analysis using @xmath9 and @xmath10 coefficients shows that slightly less than one half ( @xmath11 in @xmath12 band ) of the ulirgs are located in the merger region defined by morphology studies of local galaxies , while the remaining sources are located in the region of late - type and irregular galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the heterogeneous distribution of ulirgs in the @xmath13 space is qualitatively consistent with the results found by numerical simulations of disk - disk mergers , and our study also shows that the measured morphological parameters are systematically affected by the signal - to - noise ratio and thus the merging galaxies can appear in various regions of the @xmath13 parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss the origins of the uncertainties and note that the morphology measurements should be implemented with caution for low physical resolution images . in general , our results reinforce the view that ulirgs contain young stellar populations and are mergers in progress , but we do not observe the concentration of ulirgs / agn in the green valley as found by other studies . </S>",
    "<S> our study provides a uniform comparison sample for studying dusty starbursts at higher redshifts such as spitzer mips 24@xmath14m - selected ulirgs at @xmath15 or submillimeter galaxies . </S>"
