    "in the interesting recent article @xcite , verlinde argued that the gravitational force is an entropic force , and thus emergent from some more fundamental theory .",
    "this is a continuation of the quest to explain gravitation as the thermodynamic limit of some underlying microphysics , begun in earnest in the seminal work @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . while there is an ever - growing literature on extensions and applications of these ideas ,",
    "there are also serious concerns regarding the theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite viability of verlinde s proposal .",
    "this debate is far from settled , and entropic explanations of the gravitational interaction remain controversial .",
    "verlinde assumes that gravity admits a holographic description , in terms of systems that exist on equipotential surfaces and represent `` bits of information . ''",
    "each such system is assumed to contribute an area @xmath0 , and thus @xmath1 is the integer number of systems that make up an equipotential surface of area @xmath2 .",
    "we will call these systems `` atoms of area . '' in @xcite , @xmath3 is equal to the planck length @xmath4 , but the general argument can support an independent length scale @xcite , or even several atom species with different sizes @xcite .    a key point in the argument is the use of the energy equipartition law @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the average energy of a single atom of area , and @xmath7 the temperature corresponding to the gravitational acceleration @xmath8 of a test mass via the unruh effect , @xmath9 we also refer the reader to the interesting independent discussion of this law in the context of gravitational physics in @xcite . it has been pointed out in the literature @xcite that this formula is usually valid only in the high temperature regime , with corrections due to the quantization of energy expected at low temperatures .",
    "this is interesting because the temperatures associated to normal gravitational accelerations are extremely low . here",
    ", we would like to make a complementary point : there are also corrections if we consider atoms with _ energy bounded from above_. in this case the average energy carried by an individual atom starts to saturate when @xmath10 becomes comparable to the highest energy level of the atom , and corrections to ensue , see for example fig .",
    "[ fi_generic ] .",
    "one reason for the assumption of finite energy comes from explanations for black hole entropy . in many of them , the systems that account for the entropy are finite dimensional , at least as long as the area of the black hole is held fixed .",
    "it is natural to identify black hole entropy with the entropy from the entropic gravity scenario for the special case that the equipotential surface is a black hole horizon .",
    "this suggests that the atoms of area have a finite dimensional state space in general , and hence bounded energy .",
    "if the atoms indeed have bounded energy , there is a maximum total energy that a system of @xmath11 atoms can carry .",
    "we will see that in the gravitational context , this translates to a _ minimal radius _",
    "@xmath12  for a given mass @xmath13  above which the gravitational acceleration can be calculated . at the minimal radius",
    ", the gravitational acceleration diverges .",
    "this is strongly reminiscent of the physical situation at the schwarzschild radius @xmath14 .",
    "a straightforward identification of @xmath12 with @xmath14 is however prohibited by the scaling of the former : we find @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ( reduced ) compton wavelength of an atom at maximum energy , and @xmath17 is a numerical constant that depends on the detailed physics of the atoms .",
    "moreover , there is an argument that shows that @xmath12 must always stay below @xmath14 , see the note added at the end of sec .",
    "[ se_conc ] .",
    "thus the minimal radius is only comparable to the schwarzschild radius , if @xmath18 and @xmath14 are comparable , in other words @xmath19 .",
    "this is for example the case for @xmath13 of the order planck mass , and planck energy atoms . for larger masses , and the same @xmath20",
    ", @xmath12 stays far below the schwarzschild radius , and verlinde s argument reproduces newton s law beyond @xmath14 .",
    "we should stress that this result is obtained by working with the nonrelativistic version of verlinde s argument .",
    "since the corrections due to finite energy are relevant for strong field , it would be interesting , and perhaps more appropriate , to study their effects in the derivation of general relativity also given in @xcite .",
    "in the following section , we discuss the physical implications of atoms with maximal energy , without referring to the details of the microscopic physics . in sec .",
    "[ se_mod ] , we discuss a simple explicit model of the atoms . a discussion of the results can be found in sec .",
    "[ se_conc ] .",
    "let us first recapitulate verlinde s derivation of newton s law , in a suitably generalized form .",
    "for this , we assume an unspecified relation @xmath21 between the temperature and the average energy of an atom of area .    we consider a spherical equipotential surface with area @xmath22 around a point mass @xmath13",
    ". then the gravitational acceleration of a test mass at distance @xmath23 is calculated as @xmath24 for the usual energy equipartition @xmath25 with @xmath17 a numerical constant , we get @xmath26 and are led to identify @xmath27 this is essentially the argument by verlinde , with @xmath17 taking into account different prefactors in the equipartition law ( see @xcite for a discussion and possible consequences of such a prefactor ) .    when considering systems with maximum energy , the relation between average energy @xmath6 and temperature is very different .",
    "there is a highest energy that can be attained , @xmath28 , and so , after some approximately linear growth , the average energy per atom saturates ( see fig .  [ fi_generic ] ) .",
    "this has important consequences : for a derivation of newton s law as above , @xmath13 and @xmath23 must be independent , but this is no longer true in general .",
    "since @xmath29 and @xmath11 is related to @xmath2 via , and @xmath22 , we find a minimal value @xmath30 for @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the ( reduced ) compton wavelength of an atom at maximum energy .",
    "to illustrate the statements of the preceding section , let us consider a very simple model for the atoms of area : we assume them to have @xmath31 nondegenerate equidistant energy levels with energy spacing @xmath32 .",
    "the hamiltonian is thus given by @xmath33 with the energy eigenstates @xmath34 .",
    "we consider the system immersed in a heat bath of inverse temperature @xmath35 . with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , one finds @xmath38 for large temperatures , this has a well defined limit @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fi_generic ] we have plotted @xmath40 for the case @xmath41 . a linear regime is visible , with corrections for low @xmath7 due to nonvanishing @xmath32 , and saturation for large @xmath7 .    to separate off the corrections at low temperature , which we will not further discuss here , and to bring out the linear regime , it is useful to take the limit @xmath42 with @xmath43 _ fixed_. in this limit @xmath44    this is a very good approximation to the actual high energy behavior ( up to a constant shift in energy ) , as can , for example , be seen from fig .",
    "[ fi_lim ] .",
    "the first term is the linear part , the second term a correction that becomes dominant at large @xmath7 and leads to a maximum average energy per atom of @xmath45 .",
    "thus there is indeed a linear regime as needed for the derivation of newton s law , provided @xmath20 is large enough .",
    "there will be corrections for high @xmath7 , i.e. , for small radius .",
    "let us also note the scaling behavior of the energy - temperature relation : @xmath46 is solely a function of the ratio @xmath47 .",
    "thus we also have @xmath48 neither , nor , can be inverted ( below @xmath20 ) in terms of elementary functions , so we can not display these corrections explicitly , but we will give two illustrative examples .",
    "first we consider gravitational acceleration at the surface of the earth .",
    "the associated unruh temperature is @xmath49 corresponding to an energy @xmath50 now we assume @xmath51ev . then relative corrections to newton s law at the surface of the earth would be extremely tiny , of the order of @xmath52 , and thus completely unmeasurable . also , @xmath53 is much smaller than @xmath54 , so corrections to newton s law would still be imperceptible near a black hole of earth mass .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath55ev , the relative corrections to newton s law at the surface of the earth would still be extremely tiny , of the order of @xmath56 , but then @xmath57 , so the gravitational acceleration would diverge at the schwarzschild radius .",
    "note however , that there are reasons to believe that @xmath20 has to be very high , see the note added at the end of sec .  [ se_conc ] .",
    "we have plotted the gravitational acceleration obtained in this way , together with the prediction from general relativity for a static observer , @xmath58 and from newton s law in fig .",
    "[ fi_div ] .",
    "one sees how the entropic gravity curve first tracks newton s law , then bends to join general relativity on the horizon .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath57 in this example is due to the fine - tuning of the parameters . with @xmath20 remaining fixed",
    ", the gravitational acceleration would diverge  for different masses  at radii larger or smaller than the schwarzschild radius .",
    "in the present work we have studied the effects that the assumption of atoms of area of bounded energy has for the derivation of newton s law in verlinde s entropic gravity . motivating",
    "this assumption is the finiteness of black hole entropy : it is natural to identify this entropy with the one from the entropic gravity scenario for the special case that the equipotential surface is a black hole horizon .",
    "this suggests that the atoms of area have a finite dimensional state space in general , and hence bounded energy .",
    "we saw that the assumption of bounded energy led , intriguingly , to the divergence of the acceleration at some nonzero radius @xmath12 .",
    "we could , however , not identify this phenomenon straightforwardly with the divergence of the acceleration of a static observer at the schwarzschild radius , since we found that @xmath12 scales in a way that involves both , the mass @xmath13 of the body , and the energy scale @xmath20 of the microscopic physics .",
    "identification of @xmath14 with @xmath12 could only be accomplished if the maximum energy @xmath20 of the atoms that make up the holographic screen would depend on the mass of the body , in a specific way .",
    "this however , is not very plausible given the physical picture of entropic gravity .",
    "implicit in the use of the equipartition law , and thus also in our present considerations , is the assumption that the degrees of freedom of the screen are immersed in a heat bath of a certain temperature @xmath7 , given by .",
    "it is not clear which physical system constitutes this heat bath .",
    "it stands to reason that it can not just be the unruh radiation that an accelerated particle is immersed in , since space itself is supposed to emerge from a course - graining of the degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "thus this point merits further investigation .",
    "what are the consequences of our results for entropic gravity ?",
    "first of all , it can be the case that the energy of the atoms of the holographic screen is not finite .",
    "after all , only entropy changes enter the derivation of newton s law ; the entropy itself may be infinite .",
    "in fact , entropy can still be finite for an infinite - dimensional system , if taken in a suitable state . _",
    "if _ the atoms of area do have bounded energy , our arguments show that verlinde s reasoning is certainly viable , as long as the maximum energy is not too low .",
    "furthermore we see no physical reason to suggest that this maximum energy has to be low .",
    "in fact , there are reasons to believe that it has to be very high ; see the note added at the end of this section .",
    "if the maximum energy is not too high , there could be interesting phenomenological consequences for strong gravitational fields .",
    "it should however be said that the entire picture of entropic gravity should be regarded with caution in the strong field regime , as new physical effects may enter the stage .",
    "we would like to add the following very useful observation by one of the referees regarding the energy scale @xmath20 .",
    "this scale must certainly be high enough for the screen to be able to hold the mass - energy that appears to be behind the screen .",
    "the ratio of mass - energy per screen area is highest for the horizon of a black hole , and turns out to be inversely proportional to the schwarzschild radius in this case .",
    "a lower bound @xmath59 can be given in terms of the schwarzschild radius @xmath60 of the smallest physically possible black hole .",
    "even for conservative assumptions about @xmath60 , the resulting bound is very high .",
    "thus corrections for astrophysical black holes seem to be completely negligible .",
    "moreover , an upper bound on the minimal radius from entropic gravity is then given by @xmath61 @xmath12 is thus always smaller than ( or at least of the same order of magnitude as ) the schwarzschild radius .",
    "corrections are only appreciable very close to extremely microscopic black holes .",
    "this argument assumes that the area atoms have universal properties and there is no binding energy between them .",
    "the former is a reasonable assumption , and the latter was assumed already in verlinde s derivation .",
    "the apparently very high @xmath20 , together with the observation that the dimensionality of the internal state space of the atoms seems to have to be quite small @xcite , seems to lead to a tension with newton s law for weak fields , as a coarsely spaced energy spectrum would lead to corrections in this regime .",
    "it may be interesting to further study the implications .",
    "the author thanks f.r .",
    "klinkhamer for helpful discussions on various aspects of entropic gravity , and for useful comments on a draft of the present work .",
    "comments by one of the referees are greatly appreciated .",
