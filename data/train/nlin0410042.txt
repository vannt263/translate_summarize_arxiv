    "integrable contour dynamics governed by the dispersionless toda ( dtoda ) hierarchy is a multifaceted subject .",
    "it underlies problems of complex analysis @xcite,@xcite , interface dynamics ( laplacian growth ) @xcite , quantum hall effect @xcite and associativity ( wdvv ) equations @xcite .",
    "a common ingredient in many of its applications is the presence of random models of normal @xmath1 matrices @xcite-@xcite , @xcite,@xcite with partition functions of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 in an appropriate large @xmath4 limit ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 fixed ) , the eigenvalues of the matrices are distributed within a planar domain ( _ support of eigenvalues _ ) with sharp edges , which depends on the parameters @xmath7 .",
    "if the support of eigenvalues is a simply - connected bounded domain with boundary given by an analytic curve @xmath8 , then @xmath9 are harmonic moments of @xmath10 and the curve evolves with @xmath11 according to the dtoda hierarchy .",
    "moreover , the corresponding @xmath0-function represents the quasiclassical limit of the partition function .",
    "a particularly interesting feature is that for almost all initial conditions the evolution of @xmath10 leads to critical configurations in which cusp - like singularities develop .",
    "this behaviour is well - known in laplacian growth @xcite and random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain solutions of the dtoda hierarchy describing contour dynamics one must impose a string equation which leads to a particular type of riemann - hilbert problem @xcite-@xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a method for finding solutions in the form of laurent polynomials @xmath12 which describe dynamics of curves with a finite number of nonzero harmonic moments , namely @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "we exhibit examples for arbitrary @xmath15 and derive their corresponding @xmath0-functions .",
    "furthermore the emergence of cusps is analytically studied .",
    "let @xmath16 be an invertible conformal map of the exterior of the unit circle to the exterior of a simply connected domain bounded by a simple analytic curve @xmath10 of the form @xmath17 where bar stands for complex conjugation ( @xmath18 on @xmath10 ) and the _ schwarz function _",
    "@xmath19 is analytic in some domain containing @xmath10 .",
    "the map @xmath20 can be represented by a laurent series @xmath21 with a real coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath23 are functions of the harmonic moments @xmath24 of the exterior of @xmath10 , which in turn can be introduced through the expansion of the schwarz function @xmath25 with @xmath26 being functions dependent on @xmath27 . as a consequence of -",
    ", it follows that @xmath28 solves the dtoda hierarchy @xmath29 where @xmath30 the function @xmath31 is defined by the laurent series @xmath32 and the symbols @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 mean truncated laurent series with only positive ( negative ) terms and the constant term , respectively .",
    "furthermore , this solution satisfies the string equation    @xmath36    these properties can be proved through the twistor scheme of takasaki - takebe @xcite .",
    "it uses orlov - schulman functions of the dtoda hierarchy @xmath37 and can be summarized as follows :    * theorem * _ if @xmath38 are functions of @xmath39 which admit expansions of the form , , and satisfy the equations @xmath40 then @xmath41 is a solution of the dtoda hierarchy constrained by the string equation . _",
    "equations are meaningful only when they are interpreted as a suitable riemann - hilbert problem on the complex plane of the variable @xmath42",
    ". thus @xmath43 must be analytic functions in a neighborhood @xmath44 of @xmath45 and @xmath46 must be analytic functions in a neighborhood @xmath47 of @xmath48 .",
    "the statement of the theorem holds provided @xmath49 .",
    "let us look for solutions of such that @xmath55 and @xmath56 are meromorphic functions of @xmath42 with possible poles at @xmath48 and @xmath45 only .",
    "then , as a consequence of the assumptions , and , from it follows that @xmath57,\\quad \\bar{z}\\in\\mathrm{v}[-1,k-1].\\ ] ] the equation @xmath58 is equivalent to the system : @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 if we now set @xmath62 with @xmath63 it can be easily seen that @xmath64 has the required expansion of the form provided @xmath55 and @xmath56 satisfy and . on the other hand , the expression for @xmath65 has an expansion of the form if the residue of @xmath66 corresponding to its laurent expansion in powers of @xmath55 verifies      hence the problem reduces to finding @xmath55 and @xmath56 satisfying , , and @xmath68 in view of we look for @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the form @xmath69 now , in order to prevent @xmath55 from having poles different from @xmath48 and @xmath45 we have to impose @xmath70 where @xmath71 denote the @xmath15 zeros of @xmath72 in this way by using the expression of @xmath65 , the only variables appearing in are @xmath73 thus , by identifying coefficients of the powers @xmath74 we get @xmath75 equations which together with the @xmath15 equations determine the @xmath76 unknowns variables @xmath77 as functions of @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , provided @xmath22 is a real coefficient , the equations are invariant under the transformation @xmath78 hence if @xmath77 solves so does @xmath79 therefore , if both solutions are close enough , they coincide and consequently @xmath80 , as required .    to complete our proof",
    "we must show that is satisfied too . to do that",
    "let us take two circles @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the complex @xmath42-plane and denote by @xmath83 and @xmath84 their images under the maps @xmath16 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "notice that due to and , the curves @xmath83 and @xmath84 have positive orientation if @xmath10 and @xmath86 have positive and negative orientation , respectively .",
    "then we have @xmath87 where we have taken into account that the integrands are analytic functions of @xmath42 in @xmath88 and that @xmath10 and the opposite curve of @xmath89 are homotopic with respect to @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , as we have already proved that @xmath64 has an expansion of the form , we deduce @xmath90 so that follows .",
    "let us illustrate the method with the case @xmath91 . the polynomial @xmath92 has two zeros at the points @xmath93 and from we get two equations which lead to @xmath94 @xmath95 identification of the powers of @xmath42 in implies @xmath96 then by solving equations - we get the solution : @xmath97 which corresponds to the conformal map describing an _ ellipse growing from a circle _",
    "@xcite      exact solutions associated to arbitrary values of @xmath15 can be found from the previous scheme .",
    "however in order to avoid complicated expressions , we set @xmath99 and look for particular solutions satisfying @xmath100 or equivalently @xmath101 under the previous assumptions and from we have that @xmath102 thus , we see that leads us to a unique equation since from it follows that @xmath65 depends on @xmath42 through @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath71 satisfies @xmath104 , then @xmath105 therefore , becomes @xmath106 on the other hand , it is easy to see that @xmath107 consequently , by equating coefficients and taking into account , we find that leads to two equations only .",
    "more precisely @xmath108 then , we get three equations for the three unknowns @xmath22 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , which proves that there exits a solution of the form . in fact , by solving - we find that @xmath111 with @xmath22 satisfying the implicit equation @xmath112            in @xcite it was proved that there is a dtoda @xmath0-function associated to each analytic curve @xmath116 , given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 are the coefficients of the expansion , and @xmath119 is determined by @xmath120 for the class of solutions we have @xmath121 and from and it follows that @xmath122 on the other hand by differentiating with respect to @xmath114 and by taking into account one finds @xmath123 thus , - and characterize the @xmath0-function of the curves determined by .",
    "the pictures of the curves associated with - show the presence of cusps at some value of @xmath114 for each fixed value of @xmath115 .",
    "indeed by using the parametric equation @xmath124 for the unit circle , we have that cusps on the curve @xmath16 appear at points where @xmath125 and @xmath126 has a nonzero imaginary part .",
    "therefore a necessary condition for @xmath127 is @xmath128 thus from we deduce @xmath129 which together with the condition @xmath130 requieres that @xmath131 at some value @xmath132 . but according to one finds that this happens at the value @xmath133 given by @xmath134 which is the point at which the profile of both positive branches of @xmath22 , as functions of @xmath114 , develop an infinite slop ( see figure 3 )",
    ".      therefore , there are @xmath15 cusps given by the roots @xmath136 which emerge when @xmath114 reaches the extreme value @xmath133 of the domain of existence of the two positive branches of @xmath22 as a function of @xmath114 ."
