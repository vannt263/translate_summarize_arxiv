    "in contrast to the case of homonuclear alkali dimers , whose excited states have a resonant dipole - dipole van der waals interaction , in heteronuclear dimers the excited and ground states both have @xmath78 van der waals interactions , where @xmath79 is the internuclear distance .",
    "this makes it more likely that a suitable excited state exists that simultaneously has good franck - condon overlap with the feshbach and ground states , making four - photon transfer schemes unnecessary @xcite .",
    "we initially chose laser wavelengths to address states of the strongly coupled @xmath80 system but found the ground - state transfer efficiency to be extremely poor , even though the predicted and measured laser couplings were strong .",
    "a transition to the @xmath10 , @xmath9 state @xcite worked much better and the results using this intermediate state are presented in this work .",
    "we attribute the low @xmath80 transfer efficiency to the fact that zeeman and hyperfine splittings in @xmath81 states are much smaller than our one - photon stirap linewidth ( @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the peak pump and dump rabi frequencies and @xmath85 is the stirap - pulse overlap time @xcite ) . in this case , multiple intermediate states are addressed simultaneously , which causes loss @xcite . while this can often be remedied by detuning far from all intermediate states , large rabi frequencies are often required . in stirap of cs@xmath4 @xcite , where the magnetic field is low enough that the total angular momentum @xmath86 is nearly a good quantum number , a fixed ratio between the dump and pump rabi frequencies of the multiple intermediate states exists and the losses are ameliorated @xcite .    decomposing the feshbach state @xmath7 into its hund s case ( a ) nuclear - spin decoupled basis states reveals it to be a superposition of @xmath87 , 2 and 3 with only the @xmath87 component coupling to @xmath88 due to the selection rules @xmath89 and @xmath90 . here",
    "@xmath91 is the total molecular angular momentum excluding nuclear spin and @xmath92 is the projection of the total electron spin onto the internuclear axis .",
    "the intermediate @xmath10 state is actually not expected to allow coupling to the @xmath16 ground state due to the selection rule @xmath93 .",
    "however , the @xmath33 , @xmath94 level of @xmath10 system lies only 16  ghz away @xcite from the @xmath95 , @xmath94 level of the the @xmath80 system and contains a small admixture of @xmath96 , @xmath97 @xcite , which can be coupled to the @xmath98 ground state . the calculated vibrational wavefunctions for both intermediate components are indicated in fig .  1 of the main text",
    ". a small admixture of @xmath99 is also possible and can not be ruled out @xcite .",
    "the @xmath88 hyperfine and zeeman manifold spans about @xmath100  mhz and we empirically found the state with the strongest couplings using @xmath101 ( vertically ) polarized pump light and @xmath102 ( horizontally ) polarized dump light .    at @xmath39",
    "g the absolute ground state is the stretched @xmath52 state .",
    "this has the same nuclear spin orientation @xmath103 , @xmath104 as the initial feshbach state , implying that the intermediate state must also have high @xmath103 , @xmath104 character for good transfer efficiency .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "subsequent spectroscopy and analysis of the @xmath10 , @xmath105 , @xmath97 state @xcite has revealed that the lowest of the 18 allowed transitions of the intermediate state manifold gives the strongest one - photon coupling and has quantum numbers @xmath51 , @xmath94 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "our intermediate state model gives us a complete picture of the possibilities for direct transfer to other @xmath98 states should the need arise .      the pump and dump stirap light is derived from diode lasers that are stabilized via phase locks using additional transfer diode lasers and tunable radiofrequency sources to two independent high - finesse cavities @xcite with finesse @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively",
    ". each laser can be tuned by hundreds of mhz with radiofrequency precision and delivers a little over @xmath111  mw into a beam with a @xmath42 intensity radius of about @xmath112  @xmath43 m at the position of the molecular sample .",
    "the short - term laser linewidths inferred from the lock signals are approximately 90 and 170  hz and the measured broadening due to acoustic effects in the optical fibers used for beam delivery is less than @xmath113  hz .      the 1d optical lattice is generated by narrow - band laser light at @xmath114  nm propagating along the vertical @xmath115-direction .",
    "the light with a power up to @xmath116  w is collimated to a beam with @xmath42-radius of @xmath117 m at the position of the molecular sample .",
    "the depth of the lattice is about @xmath118 at @xmath119  w , where @xmath120 khz is the photon recoil energy , with @xmath121 the mass of the rbcs molecule . at such a depth , tunneling from well",
    "to well is fully suppressed .      to simulate the stirap process we use a master equation in lindblad form @xcite .",
    "the effects of finite laser linewidths are included in the model , but the effects of beam shape and phase noise pedestals are not .",
    "the basis set contains the feshbach state , the excited state , and the lowest 10 hyperfine and zeeman ground states .",

    "this factor is varied until the black theory curve fits the data near the main ( v@xmath5 , h@xmath13 ) peak shown in fig .  3 of the main text .    from the natural linewidth of the excited level @xmath9 , measured to be @xmath122  khz , along with a one - photon on - resonance absorption measurement @xcite",

    "we fit solutions to this equation to the data shown in fig .  4 to determine @xmath65 as shown in the inset to fig .  4 .",
