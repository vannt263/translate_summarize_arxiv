    "the pleiades open cluster has become a favorite location for brown dwarf ( bd ) searches .",
    "this privilege is due to its proximity , young age , low extinction and compactness ( the same properties that make it easily recognized to the naked eye ) .",
    "such advantages were recognized over ten years ago , when the first ccd surveys of the cluster began ( jameson & skillen @xcite ; stauffer et al .",
    "since then , there has been many efforts to reach fainter magnitudes and cover more area ( see hambly @xcite for a review ) , which have revealed many bd candidates .",
    "a breakthrough in our understanding of bds has come from the successful application of the lithium test ( rebolo , martn & magazz @xcite ; magazz , martn & rebolo @xcite ) , which is an efficient observational method for distinguishing young bds from very low - mass ( vlm ) stars .",
    "the first object at the substellar limit with a li detection was ppl 15 ( basri , marcy & graham @xcite ; hereafter bmg ) and soon after li was detected in the bds teide 1 and calar 3 ( rebolo et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the detection of lithium in ppl  15 and the non - detection in hhj  3 ( marcy et al .",
    "1994 ) was used by bmg to infer an age of @xmath1115  myr for the pleiades cluster , which is substantially older than the canonical cluster age of 75  myr inferred from standard calculations of the upper main - sequence turnoff .",
    "they argued that the turnoff age increases when core convective overshoot is included in the evolutionary calculations , an effect that could account for the difference between dating the cluster with high - mass stars and with vlm objects .",
    "ppl  15 was shown to lie on the binary infrared cluster sequence ( zapatero - osorio , martn & rebolo @xcite ) , and recently it has been found to be a spectroscopic double - lined bd binary ( basri & martn @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the luminosity used by bmg was overestimated because they assumed that the object was single .",
    "this is relevant for the discussion of the cluster age , because the luminosity and lithium of ppl  15 implied that it had to be younger than 125  myr .",
    "since the luminosity of the primary in the ppl  15 binary is lower , the age could be older . in this paper",
    "we present the discovery of a new object in the pleiades , which has a luminosity similar to the ppl  15 system .",
    "this object is located on the cluster sequence for single objects , and thus its luminosity is not expected to be affected by a close companion .",
    "we have detected lithium in it , which confirms its cluster membership , and makes it an important object for defining the lithium substellar boundary and constraining the cluster age .",
    "the object presented in this paper was discovered in a ccd survey of the pleiades carried out using the 0.82  m iac80 telescope at the observatorio del teide in november and december of 1995 , and january 1996 .",
    "we used a thomson 1048@xmath2 ccd with a field of view of 54.5 arcmin@xmath2 and @xmath3 filters .",
    "two exposure of 1800s were obtained for each filter .",
    "we observed 13 different fields , forming a mosaic of 590  arcmin@xmath2 .",
    "the images were bias subtracted , flat fielded , corrected for bad columns , and searched for pointlike sources using daophot routines within iraf .",
    "the fwhm of the stars in our frames were in the range 1``.5 to 2''.5 .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were calibrated with a secondary standard field within the pleiades that we had observed in previous runs ( zapatero - osorio , rebolo & martn @xcite ) . due to variable seeing conditions",
    ", we did not reach the same sensitivity in all the fields .",
    "we estimate that our completeness limits are in the range @xmath4=18.519.0 mag .",
    "near - infrared ( nir ) follow - up observations of the bd candidates found in the ccd survey were carried out on 1996 nov 2 and 1997 sep 2123 at the calar alto 2.2  m telescope with magic , and the lick 1  m telescope with lircii , respectively .",
    "the standard @xmath5 and @xmath6 filter set was used .",
    "total exposure times ranged from 60 to 120  s in each filter .",
    "we used the iraf daophot package to reduce the frames and extract the photometry .",
    "instrumental aperture magnitudes were corrected for atmospheric extinction and transformed into the cit system using observations of the stars in the field of the bd calar  3 as standards ( zapatero - osorio et al .",
    "only one bd candidate had optical and infrared photometry consistent with being a pleiades member .",
    "we named it teide  pleiades  2 ( from now on abreviated simply to teide  2 ) because it resulted from the extension of the pleiades survey at the teide observatory .",
    "a preliminary report of this discovery was made by gallegos et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the coordinates and @xmath7 photometry are listed in table  [ tab1 ] and the finding chart is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "teide  2 is included in the recent cfht survey ( bouvier et al .",
    "@xcite ) , where it has a magnitude of @xmath4=18.02@xmath80.05 which is 0.2 mag brighter than ours .",
    "we have compared directly the cfht and iac80 ccd images and find that teide  2 has changed its brightness with respect to field reference stars .",
    "for the j - band , the magnitudes obtained in calar alto and lick differ by 0.12 mag , which is somewhat larger than the expected error bars . teide  2 is probably variable in @xmath4 , and perhaps also in @xmath5 .",
    "this suggestion needs to be confirmed with photometric monitoring , which might measure the rotation period if the variability is due to photospheric spots .",
    "low - resolution spectroscopy of teide  2 was obtained on 1996 dec 8 and 9 using the isis double - arm spectrograph at the wht ( we only used the red arm ) with the grating r158r and a tek 1024@xmath2 ccd detector ; and the lris spectrograph with the 1200  line  mm@xmath9 grating and a tek 2048@xmath2 ccd detector at the keck  ii telescope . the spectral resolution ( fwhm ) and",
    "wavelength coverage provided by each instrumental setup were 5.8     and 650915  nm , and 1.9     and 654775  nm , respectively .",
    "reduction and calibration procedures were the same as described in zapatero - osorio et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopic observations were obtained on 1997 dec 3 and 7 , at the keck  i telescope equipped with the hires echelle spectrometer .",
    "the instrumental configuration and data reduction have been discussed by marcy et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and bmg .",
    "the resolving power obtained was r=31000 .",
    "we took two spectra of teide  2 with exposure times of 3600  s and 4000  s. however , the sky was cloudy when the first spectrum was taken and we obtained a factor of 2 less counts than in the second spectrum .",
    "we also obtained one 2700  s exposure of ppl  1 , a bd candidate discovered by stauffer et al .",
    "( 1989 ) which has a similar brightness to teide  2 .",
    "a color - magnitude diagram displaying the position of teide  2 and ppl  1 with respect to other members of the pleiades is presented in figure  [ fig2 ] together with a theoretical 120  myr isochrone ( dashed line ) , and the main - sequence of field m - dwarfs ( solid line ) shifted to the pleiades distance ( 127  pc ) and mean reddening ( a@xmath10=0.12 ) .",
    "teide  2 falls close to the theoretical isochrone , whereas ppl  15 clearly lies above it , suggesting that it could be a binary ( zapatero - osorio et al .",
    "basri & martn ( 1998 ) confirmed that ppl  15 is indeed a double - lined spectroscopic binary with a mass ratio close to unity , implying that both components have nearly identical luminosities .",
    "thus , we have indicated in figure  [ fig2 ] that the i magnitude of each component in the ppl  15 system is @xmath10.75 mag .",
    "fainter , while the @xmath11 color remains about the same .",
    "ppl  15 now falls right on the 120  myr isochrone for a mass of 0.06  m@xmath12 , well below the substellar boundary .",
    "the location of teide  2 in figure  [ fig2 ] indicates a mass of 0.072  m@xmath12 which is just below the expected substellar limit ( 0.075  m@xmath12 , cf .",
    "baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ) . the position of ppl  1 above the isochrone might be due to measurement errors , photometric variability , binarity or younger age .",
    "we can not presently distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "radial velocities for teide  2 and ppl  1 were obtained by cross - correlating three hires echelle orders covering the ranges 786.4797.5  nm , 804.2815.6  nm and 822.9834.6  nm with the m6v template gl  406 ( @xmath13=19.2@xmath80.1 km s@xmath9 ; x. delfosse , private communication ) observed using the same instrumental configuration .",
    "the radial velocities obtained are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the error bars listed come from the dispersion among the different echelle orders , and correspond to about 0.4 pixels .",
    "no significant radial velocity variation was detected between the two spectra of teide  2 taken on dec  3 and dec  7 .",
    "stauffer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) obtained a radial velocity for ppl  1 of 14.3@xmath810 km s@xmath9 , which is consistent with our measurement .",
    "the radial velocity of teide  2 is consistent with known cluster members , while that of ppl  1 is a little on the high side .",
    "the mean velocity of nearby field dwarfs in the line of sight toward the pleiades is also similar to the cluster members ( stauffer et al .",
    "@xcite ) , hence radial velocity alone is not very reliable as a membership criterion .",
    "there are more spectroscopic indicators that allow us to further investigate the membership of our objects in the pleiades .",
    "one is the strength of h@xmath14 in emission , which is typically greater than 3     in proper motion m4m6 cluster members ( hodgkin , jameson & steele @xcite ) . for teide",
    "2 we measured h@xmath14 equivalent widths of 9.5@xmath15 , 8.5@xmath15 and 4.7@xmath16     in our isis , lris and hires spectra , respectively . for ppl  1 we measured 2.3@xmath17   in our hires spectrum .",
    "stauffer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and martn , rebolo & zapatero osorio ( @xcite ) published h@xmath14 measurement for ppl  1 of 4.8     and 6.5   , respectively .",
    "the h@xmath14 emission of both teide  2 and ppl  1 has variable strength , but on the average they are comparable to those of late m - type proper motion pleiades members .",
    "we measured the rotational broadening of teide  2 and ppl  1 in our hires spectra .",
    "we artificially broadened gl  406 ( vsin_i_@xmath182.9  km  s@xmath9 ; delfosse et al .",
    "@xcite ) with different values of vsin_i _ until we found the best match to the observed broadening of our pleiades objects .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "field m4m6 dwarfs usually have vsin_i_@xmath1810 ( delfosse et al .",
    "thus , the vsin_i _ of teide  2 and ppl  1 also indicate that they are young .",
    "a third clue to membership comes from the general features seen in the low - resolution spectrum of teide  2 , which shows prominent tio and vo molecular absorption bands and strong atomic lines of ki ( 766.5 and 769.9  nm ) and nai ( 818.3 and 819.5  nm ) characteristic of a cool dwarf .",
    "the spectral type of teide  2 is m6@xmath80.5 according to the pseudocontinuum indices defined by ( martn et al .",
    "@xcite ) . teide  2 nicely fits the sequence of pleiades members in the @xmath4-magnitude versus spectral type diagram of martn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "summarizing , the radial velocities , h@xmath14 emission , vsin_i _ , spectral type and photometric properties of teide  2 and ppl  1 support their pleiades membership with a high level of confidence .    in the top half of figure  [ fig3 ] we compare the spectra of ppl  1 , teide  2 and ppl  15 .",
    "the spectrum of ppl  1 is noisier than those of the other two objects because it was taken with the 2.5  m isaac newton telescope ( martn et al .",
    "@xcite ) . teide  2 and ppl  1 have similar spectral type within the error bars , and ppl  15 is somewhat cooler but not more than one spectral subclass .",
    "teide  2 confirms that the dividing line between stars and bds in the pleiades is at spectral type @xmath1m6 ( martn et al .",
    "this result strengthens the recent identification of objects m6m8 in several star - forming regions ( orion , taurus , @xmath19  oph ) as likely brown dwarfs .",
    "briceo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and luhman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have shown that the nai lines of some bd candidates in taurus are much weaker than those of dwarfs , indicating that the very young bds have low gravities .",
    "we note that the equivalent width of the nai ( 818.3 and 819.5  nm ) measured in our wht spectrum of teide  2 is 6.0@xmath80.3   .",
    "this line is stronger than those of the taurus bds of similar spectral type as expected because the pleiades is much older , but slightly weaker than those of old m6 field dwarfs .",
    "in the bottom half of figure  [ fig3 ] we compare the hires spectra of hhj  3 and teide  2 .",
    "marcy et al .",
    "( 1994 ) placed an upper limit to the lii equivalent width of hhj  3 of 0.19   .",
    "our spectrum of teide  2 has lower s / n ratio than their spectrum of hhj  3 , because our target is fainter and we had worse weather conditions .",
    "however , the lii feature in teide  2 is clearly much stronger than in hhj  3 and we were able to detect it in our spectra .",
    "we measured an equivalent width of 0.77@xmath80.15     with respect to the local pseudocontinuum .",
    "our spectrum of ppl  1 has a factor of about 2 lower s / n ratio than that of teide  2 .",
    "we degraded the resolution by performing a rebinning of 6 pixels and found a feature at the position of the lii line .",
    "however , we are not completely confident of a lithium detection in ppl  1 , and hence we place a conservative upper limit to its equivalent width .",
    "we have compared the spectrum of teide  2 with that of ppl  15 ( bmg ) and we conclude that their lii strengths are similar .",
    "the conversion from the observed lines to photospheric lithium abundance needs the use of synthetic spectra .",
    "the main problem lies with our incomplete knowledge of the transitions of the tio molecule , which is the main absorber in this spectral region .",
    "new calculations by pavlenko ( @xcite ) suggest that the lithium abundances of teide  2 and ppl  15 could be close to the interstellar value , implying that these objects have suffered little depletion .",
    "the estimate made by bmg that ppl  15 had preserved @xmath11% of its initial lithium is a conservative lower limit .",
    "furthermore , their measure of the lii equivalent width is compromised by its binary nature .",
    "the vlm members of the pleiades ( @xmath200.1  m@xmath12 ) are non - degenerate , fully convective objects that derive most of their luminosity from gravitational contraction .",
    "hence , their evolution is relatively simple and can even be computed analytically ( bildsten et al .",
    "the faintest pleiades member for which lithium is undetected gives a lower limit to the age .",
    "this is currently hhj  3 , and bmg obtained an age older than about 110  myrs for it .",
    "we have checked with new theoretical models ( baraffe et al .",
    "@xcite ; bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ; burrows 1997 ( private communication ) ; dantona & mazzitelli @xcite ) that the lower age limit set by hhj  3 is in the range 100120  myr taking into account the observational error bars .",
    "this result is not sensitive to the choice of theoretical models .",
    "on the other hand , the brightest bds for which lithium is detected provide an upper limit to the cluster age .",
    "we have converted the @xmath21 photometry and spectral type of teide  2 to bolometric luminosity by employing relationships derived for cool field dwarfs ( tinney et al .",
    "since teide  2 shows lithium , its luminosity implies that it has to be younger than 120  myr according to all the available models .",
    "we have also compared directly the absolute @xmath22magnitudes of teide  2 with the predictions of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and find similar results .",
    "teide  2 and hhj  3 can only be coeval if both of them have ages in the narrow range 100120  myr . with only a few objects around the cluster substellar",
    "limit we can not rule out the possibility of an age spread , but their location close to the 120  myr isochrone in figure  [ fig2 ] indicates that they are essentially coeval .",
    "all the recent models also agree that the mass of teide  2 is just below the substellar limit .",
    "taking into account the observational error bars and the different models , we estimate a mass of 0.070@xmath80.005  m@xmath12 .",
    "teide  2 is most likely a single bd , or if it is a binary the secondary does not contribute much to the optical - nir fluxes .",
    "hence , teide  2 can be considered a benchmark object defining the borderline between bds and stars in the pleiades .",
