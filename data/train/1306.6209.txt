    "<S> we present a thermal rectification device concept based on far - field radiative exchange between two selective emitters . </S>",
    "<S> rectification is achieved due to the fact that one of the selective emitters radiative properties are independent on temperature whereas the other emitter properties are strongly temperature dependent . a simple device constituted by two multilayer samples made of metallic ( au ) and semiconductor ( si and hdsi ) thin films </S>",
    "<S> is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> this device shows a rectification up to @xmath0 with a temperature difference @xmath1 k , a rectification ratio that has never been achieved so far with radiation - based rectifiers . </S>",
    "<S> further optimization would allow larger rectification values . presented results might be useful for energy conversion devices , smart radiative coolers / insulators engineering and thermal modulators development .    </S>",
    "<S> thermal rectification can be defined as an asymmetry in the heat flux when the temperature difference between two interacting thermal reservoirs is reversed . </S>",
    "<S> the realization of a device exhibiting such an uncommon behavior , a thermal diode for instance , would pave the way to the development of thermal circuits in the manner non - linear electronic devices marked the genesis of modern electronics@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , an increasing interest has been given to thermal rectifiers during the last years . </S>",
    "<S> experimental rectifiers based on carbon and boron nitride nanotubes @xcite , semiconductor quantum dots @xcite and bulk cobalt oxides@xcite have been realized . besides , </S>",
    "<S> numerous theoretical models have also been proposed , based on non - linear lattices @xcite , graphene nano - ribbons@xcite and several other interesting mechanisms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some authors went beyond the thermal rectifiers issue and proposed theoretical models of thermal logical gates @xcite and a thermal transistor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an overwhelming majority of the proposed devices schemes are based on conductive heat transfer channels control and very few radiative thermal rectifiers have been reported thus far . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a theoretical study and an experimental suggestion of a radiative thermal rectifier based on non - linear solid - state quantum circuits operating at very low temperatures ( a few mk ) have recently been presented@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a rectification up to @xmath2 is predicted . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , two theoretical schemes of radiative thermal rectification based on near - field thermal radiation control have lately been proposed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a rectification up to @xmath3 is theoretically predicted .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , a far - field radiation based thermal rectifier made of selective emitters previously developed for thermo - photovoltaic applications@xcite is presented . </S>",
    "<S> this device provides larger rectification ratios than reported in literature with radiative thermal rectifiers and comparable temperature differences . besides , the far - field radiation based devices are more suitable for experimental implementations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , since the presented device is based on spectrally tunable selective emitters , the proposed rectifier allows high rectification ratios in different spectral ranges , thus at different operating temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : planeplane ] presents a schematic of the proposed device composed of two parallel planar bodies @xmath4 and @xmath5 separated by a gap of thickness @xmath6 and characterized by their dielectric functions and temperatures ( @xmath7 ) and ( @xmath8 ) respectively .     </S>",
    "<S> much larger than wien wavelength @xmath9 . in forward bias configuration , </S>",

    "<S> is then given by : @xmath17 the two bodies are assumed to be in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 is thus a radiative heat flux ( rhf ) . </S>",
    "<S> the considered bodies radiative properties , in particular their emissivities and reflectivities ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively ) , are completely governed by their dielectric functions and geometries . in the case of opaque bodies , </S>",
    "<S> energy conservation and kirchhoff s laws combination leads to the following relation between the monochromatic emissivity and reflectivity at a given temperature : @xmath21 we also assume the two bodies are lambertian sources . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are thus direction - independent . </S>",
    "<S> + the gap width @xmath6 is assumed to be much larger than the dominant thermal radiation wavelength ( wien wavelength ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are planck constant , the speed of light in vacuum , boltzmann constant and the absolute temperature , respectively . the net rhf density exchanged by the two media resumes then to the far field contribution which can be written @xcite : @xmath27   \\tau(\\lambda , t_1,t_2 ) d \\lambda \\label{eq : fluxdensity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the black body intensity at a temperature @xmath26 and @xmath29 is the monochromatic rhf density transmission coefficient between @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> now , let us assume the two bodies are selective emitters so that they behave as quasi - monochromatic spectral emitters , i.e. they present reflectivity valleys ( or emissivity peaks ) of the same finite width @xmath30 at given wavelengths , @xmath31 for instance . </S>",

    "<S> body @xmath4 emissivity is t - independent . </S>",
    "<S> body @xmath5 emissivity is initially identical to that of body @xmath4 in forward bias ( @xmath38 ) while its peak shifts to the red by @xmath39 when the temperatures of the two bodies are reversed i.e. @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this shift with the temperature of one of the selective emitters radiative properties is the key to achieve thermal rectification . </S>",
    "<S> consider for now a small shift verifying @xmath41 thus the two peaks still partially overlap in reverse biased configuration . in fig . </S>",

    "<S> since @xmath55 elsewhere else , the terms with the pre - factor @xmath56 in the integrand are of the first order . in reverse biased configuration , we can note that the spectral domains of the order zero and the first order terms are reduced and extended respectively due to the shift between the two peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of the dominating term ( order @xmath57 ) due to its spectral domain diminution , if it is different from the higher order term ( @xmath4st order ) increase , would lead to an asymmetry of the rhf and therefore a rectification phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> + for the above presented situation , calculations lead to : @xmath58 w.m@xmath59 , @xmath60 w.m@xmath59 and @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this rectification value is of the order of the largest reported values for radiative thermal rectifiers . according to the previous assumptions , this rectification ratio obviously depends on the chosen parameters , in particular the temperatures @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the peaks position @xmath64 compared to @xmath65 , their width @xmath30 compared to the black body spectrum useful width at the largest temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the shift between the two peaks in reverse bias @xmath39 compared to @xmath30 and the reflectors and emitters quality characterized by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the maximal rectification ratio is reached when the peaks shift in reverse bias is larger than the peaks width and when the bodies are perfect reflectors outside the peaks , i.e. when @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively : reverse bias rhf vanishes and rectification reaches 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the first condition on @xmath39 is more easily realized with narrow emissivity peaks . </S>",
    "<S> however , narrower emissivity peaks would decrease forward bias rhf density which makes the rectification ratio more sensitive to the rhf density noise ( high order terms ) , i.e. to heat transmitted in a spectral range outside the peaks thus to @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> now , we propose a real system that would allow a practical realization of the above presented device concept . </S>",
    "<S> the key point to obtain such a rectification device is to use selective emitters i.e bodies that behave as mirrors in the mid - infrared except on a narrow - band wavelength range where they strongly emit . </S>",
    "<S> one of the bodies has to have temperature independent radiative properties whereas the other one must present an emission peak shift sufficiently large with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , we use selective emitters based on fabry - prot resonant cavities previously developed for thermo - photovoltaic applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , these structures present emissivity peaks in the near and mid infra - red . </S>",
    "<S> second , the peaks positions and widths can be controlled by few simple parameters such as layers thicknesses and the cavity reflectors quality . </S>",

    "<S> in fact , the linear thermal expansion coefficient of used materials is , at the most , of the order of @xmath81 k@xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads , for a @xmath83 k temperature variation , to a relative variation of films thicknesses of one thousandth . </S>",

    "<S> is increased , the peak shifts to the red , i.e. closer to the black body maximal emission wavelength at @xmath85 k and gets wider . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , a slightly wider and smaller secondary peak appears at larger wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> all these evolutions will obviously induce an increase in the net rhf . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical application leads to @xmath89 w.m@xmath59 , @xmath90 w.m@xmath59 and @xmath91 . + </S>",
    "<S> the proposed device rectification is therefore of @xmath0 , a value larger by almost a factor of two than the largest reported values for radiative rectifiers@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , instead of diminishing , the net rhf density increases when switching from forward to reverse bias configurations . </S>",
    "<S> this is mainly due to the fact that , in addition to its emissivity peak shift at high temperature , the gold - composed fabry - prot cavity becomes less reflecting outside the peak which allows it to exchange more heat over the whole black body spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the rhf density drop due to the peaks mismatch is compensated by the higher emissivity / absorptivity of the gold - silicon selective emitter over the considered spectral range at @xmath85 k. according to eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : piiecewiserevrhf ] , this effect is mainly due to the fact that high order terms become dominating when the temperatures of the two bodies are reversed . </S>",
    "<S> note that the proposed device can be improved to obtain higher rectification . </S>",
    "<S> further optimization of the presented system with a strong constraint on the reflectors quality , i.e. on the values of @xmath66 , would lead to performances comparable to those of the ideal device .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we presented a theoretical concept of a thermal rectifier based on far field thermal radiation . </S>",
    "<S> then , we suggested a real nano - structured system based on two multi - layered bodies as a candidate for an experimental observation . </S>",
    "<S> this system shows an absolute rectification value larger by almost a factor two than those proposed in literature with radiation - based rectification devices and comparable temperature differences@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the proposed device is quite easy to realize since it involves samples radiating in the far - field . </S>",
    "<S> finally , an optimization process would certainly lead to larger rectification values . </S>",
    "<S> the use of very high thermal expansion coefficient meta - materials would offer new possibilities to control the peaks mismatch , thus the rectification ratio , through the cavity width variation . </S>",
    "<S> presented results might be useful for energy conversion devices , smart radiative coolers / insulators engineering and thermal modulators development . </S>"
