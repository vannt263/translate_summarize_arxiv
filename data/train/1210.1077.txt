    "bloch model is a very common model to describe the time evolution of a system of electrons in different contexts such as gases of electrons , glasses , or crystals .",
    "the very classical case of gases and glasses involves isotropic media .",
    "the electrons are supposed to be localized and non interacting .",
    "their behavior is averaged at the mesoscopic scale .",
    "this leads to relatively simple models where matter energy levels are quantized and labelled by integers .",
    "the case of crystals @xcite also involves integer indexed levels , but symmetries and directions in matter have to be taken into account .",
    "bloch model has also been extended to the description of quantum wells @xcite , and quantum dots @xcite . in these models ,",
    "matter is described by the state of two species of particles ( electrons and holes , or equivalently conduction and valence electrons ) . in quantum wells ,",
    "energy levels are indexed by vectors , which correspond to displacements over the underlying lattice .",
    "in contrast , the confinement of electrons in quantum dots leads to integer indexed levels like in gases , which often leads to consider quantum dots as pseudo - atoms , but this is a very raw vision . in particular , among other differences , electrons at the same mesoscopic location do interact directly _ via _ coulomb interaction .",
    "@xcite is a preliminary paper that derives basic bloch equations for two species of electrons ( conduction and valence ) only taking into account the free electron hamiltonian and the interaction with a laser electric field .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to include properly coulomb interaction in this model . beyond the sole derivation of the model , we want in particular to study its mathematical properties . in the continuation of @xcite , we want to show that a certain number of properties are preserved through the time evolution , such as hermicity and positiveness of the density matrix .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we devote section [ sec : basicmodel ] to the description of the basic bloch model which does not include coulomb interaction but only the free energies of the electrons and the action of an electromagnetic field . in section",
    "[ sec : coulomb ] , we derive the coulomb hamiltonian in terms of the conduction and valence operators .",
    "the associated heisenberg equation is derived in section [ sec : heisenberg ] , but it ends up with an open system of equations .",
    "the system is closed using the wick theorem , and the final bloch equation has a liouville form , but is nonlinear .",
    "this nonlinearity does not allow to use previous literature directly and we prove anew the hermicity , positiveness and boundedness results in section [ sec : maths ] . in section [ sec : numerics ] , we show the impact of the coulomb contribution in numerical results and also compare our model with a vanishing intra - band coherence model defined in @xcite .",
    "let us first recall the main results obtained in @xcite and fix the notations .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be two operators , we define their commutator by @xmath2=ab - ba$ ] and their skew - commutator by @xmath3 .",
    "for an operator @xmath0 , we define the associated observable @xmath4 by averaging with respect to the initial state density @xmath5 of the system .",
    "if the system is described by a hamiltonian @xmath6 , the time - evolution for this observable is given by the heisenberg equation @xmath7 \\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the reduced planck constant .",
    "when the observable is the density matrix , the heisenberg equation of motion is called the bloch equation .",
    "a quantum dot is defined as a collection of conduction and valence electrons .",
    "there is of course no conduction in quantum dots since the electrons are confined in every direction , but this terminology is useful to distinguish between the valence electrons  which are in fact the absence of holes in the valence band  and the free , but confined , electrons . for each species ,",
    "energy levels are quantized and indexed by a set of integers , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , for conduction and valence electrons , respectively . for @xmath11",

    "this implies in particular that @xmath19 , which means that it is impossible to create twice or annihilate twice the same electron .",
    "this is the pauli exclusion rule : electrons are fermions .",
    "of course any conduction operator commutes with any valence operator .",
    "the observable we are interested in is the _ density matrix_. it includes a _ conduction density matrix _ , which elements are the @xmath20 .",
    "this matrix is hermitian and positive semi - definite .",
    "its diagonal terms @xmath21 are also called _",
    "populations _ and give the probability to find an electron in state @xmath22 .",
    "the off - diagonal terms , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are called _ ( intra - band ) coherences_. of course we also define a _ valence density matrix _ , which elements are the @xmath25 . besides we are interested in _ inter - band coherences _ defined by @xmath26 .",
    "the entries of these matrices are the variables of the bloch equation .",
    "they are cast in a single density matrix @xmath27 where @xmath28 , which ensures that @xmath29 is hermitian and positive semi - definite .",
    "the basic bloch equation for quantum dot is derived in @xcite .",
    "it takes into account two types of hamiltonians in the heisenberg equation for the density matrix , namely free electron hamiltonians and interaction hamiltonians with a laser field .",
    "the free electron hamiltonians read @xmath30 for conduction and valence electrons respectively . the coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the free electron energies associated with each electron level .",
    "the electron levels are described by the wave functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 , solutions to the free electron schrdinger equation subject to the boundary conditions of the quantum dot ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the interaction with a laser characterized by its time - dependent electric field @xmath35 is described by the hamiltonians @xmath36 where the dipolar moment matrices are matrices with entries in @xmath37 and may be expressed in terms of the wave functions associated to each level : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the unsigned charge of the electron .",

    "the coulomb potentials have the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is coulomb s constant .",
    "the difference of treatment of conduction and valence electrons stems from the fact that coulomb interaction describes the interaction of electrons and holes ( see e.g. @xcite ) and that the presence of an electron in the valence band is indeed the absence of the corresponding hole , and vice - versa , which inverts the role of creation and annihilation operators .",

    "the conclusion is that even if intra - band coherences seem not to be very relevant for some physical applications , it is very important to include them in the mathematical description and in the numerical computation to keep the natural mathematical structure of the density matrix .    in absence of electromagnetic field",
    "the evolution equation for the conduction electrons is reduced to @xmath279 this is only due to the fact that there is only one conduction level in our test case , and does not depend on the intra - band coherence vanishing assumption or on specific values of the coulomb coefficients .",
