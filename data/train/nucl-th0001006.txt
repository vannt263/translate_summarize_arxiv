    "the study of superfluidity in infinitely extended nuclear systems has a long history [ 182 ] , predating the 1967 discovery of pulsars @xcite , which were soon identified as rapidly rotating magnetic neutron stars @xcite .",
    "interest in nucleonic pairing has intensified in recent years , owing primarily to experimental developments on two different fronts . in the field of astrophysics ,",
    "a series of @xmath4-ray satellites ( including einstein , exosat , rosat , and asca ) has brought a flow of data on thermal emission from neutron stars , comprising both upper limits and actual flux measurements .",
    "the recent launching of the chandra @xmath4-ray observatory provides further impetus for more incisive theoretical investigations . realistic _",
    "ab initio _ prediction of the microscopic physics of nucleonic superfluid components in the interiors of neutron stars is crucial to a quantitative understanding of neutrino cooling mechanisms [ 8595 ] that operate immediately after their birth in supernova events , as well as the magnetic properties , vortex structure , rotational dynamics , and pulse timing irregularities [ 9699 ] of these superdense stellar objects .",
    "in particular , when nucleonic species enter a superfluid state in one or another region of the star , suppression factors of the form @xmath5 are introduced into the expression for the emissivity , @xmath6 being an appropriate average measure of the energy gap at the fermi surface . on the terrestrial front ,",
    "the expanding capabilities of radioactive - beam and heavy - ion facilities have stimulated a concerted exploration of exotic nuclei and nuclei far from stability , with special focus on neutron - rich species @xcite .",
    "pairing plays a prominent role in modeling the structure and behavior of these new nuclei .    in this article",
    "we will be principally concerned with nucleonic pairing in the astrophysical setting .",
    "to a first approximation , a neutron star is described as a neutral system of nucleons ( and possibly heavier baryons ) and electrons ( and possibly muons ) in beta equilibrium at zero temperature , with a central density several times the saturation density @xmath7 of symmetrical nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the gross structure of the star ( mass , radius , pressure and density profiles ) is determined by the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov general relativistic equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , consistently with the continuity equation and the equation of state ( which embodies the microscopic physics of the system ) .",
    "the star contains ( i ) an _ outer crust _ made up of bare nuclei arranged in a lattice interpenetrated by relativistic electrons , ( ii ) an _ inner crust _ where a similar coulomb lattice of neutron - rich nuclei is embedded in fermi seas of relativistic electrons and neutrons , ( iii ) a _ quantum fluid interior _ of coexisting neutron , proton , and electron fluids , and finally ( iv ) a _ core region _ of uncertain constitution and phase ( but possibly containing hyperons , a pion or kaon condensate and/or quark matter ) .",
    "it is generally accepted @xcite that the neutrons in the background fluid of the inner crust of a neutron star will pair - condense in the @xmath0s@xmath1 state .",
    "qualitatively , this phenomenon can be understood as follows . at the relatively large average particle spacing at the `` low '' densities involved in this region ( @xmath8 ) , the delocalized neutrons experience mainly the attractive component the @xmath0s@xmath1 interaction .",
    "however , the pairing effect is quenched at higher densities , @xmath9 and beyond , due to the strong short - range component of this interaction . by similar reasoning ,",
    "one expects @xmath0s@xmath1 proton pairing to occur in the quantum fluid interior , in a density regime where the proton contaminant ( necessary for charge balance and chemical equilibrium ) reaches a partial density @xmath10 .",
    "the energy dependence of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath11 ) phase shifts in different partial waves offers some guidance in judging what nucleonic pair - condensed states are possible or likely in different regions of a neutron star .",
    "a rough correspondence between baryon density and @xmath11 bombardment energies can be established through the fermi momenta assigned to the nucleonic components of neutron - star matter @xcite , which provide a crude measure of the maximum relative momenta attained in the nuclear medium . in ( pure ) neutron matter ,",
    "only @xmath12 partial waves are allowed by the pauli principle . moreover , one need only consider partial waves with @xmath13 in the range of baryon density  optimistically , @xmath14  where a nucleonic model of neutron - star material is tenable .",
    "the @xmath0s@xmath1 phase shift is positive at low energy ( indicating an attractive in - medium force ) but turns negative ( repulsive ) at around 250 mev lab energy .",
    "thus , unless the in - medium pairing force is dramatically different from its vacuum counterpart , the situation already suggested above should prevail : s - wave pairs should form at low densities but should be inhibited from forming when the density approaches that of ordinary nuclear matter .",
    "the next lowest @xmath12 partial waves are the three triplet p waves @xmath2p@xmath15 , with @xmath16 , which are actually coupled by the tensor force to the triplet f waves with the same total angular momentum @xmath17 . of these channels ,",
    "the first two are not good candidates for pairing . in the @xmath2p@xmath1 state ,",
    "the phase shift is only mildly attractive at low energy , turning repulsive at a lab energy of 200 mev , while the @xmath2p@xmath18 phase shift is repulsive at all energies . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath2p@xmath3 phase shift is negative at all energies , and indeed is the most attractive @xmath12 phase shift at energies above about 160 mev .",
    "this exceptional attractive strength in the @xmath2p@xmath3 state is due mainly to the spin - orbit interaction and in part to the coupling to @xmath2f@xmath3 wave via the tensor component of the @xmath11 force .",
    "a substantial pairing effect in the @xmath2p@xmath3@xmath2f@xmath3 channel may be expected at densities somewhat in excess of @xmath7 , again assuming that the relevant in - vacuum interaction is not greatly altered within the medium .",
    "the remaining @xmath19 partial waves with @xmath13 are both singlets : @xmath0d@xmath3 and @xmath0g@xmath20 . however , the @xmath0d@xmath3 phase shift , though positive over the energy domain of interest , is clearly dominated by the @xmath2p@xmath3 phase shift , while the @xmath0g@xmath20 phase shift , again positive , is even less important .    therefore , in the conventional picture of neutron - star matter ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , singlet and triplet pairing are operationally equivalent to @xmath0s@xmath1 and @xmath2p@xmath3@xmath2f@xmath3 pairing , respectively .",
    "there have been many illuminating studies of the former problem , notably @xcite .",
    "here we shall concentrate on triplet pairing in the pure neutron system , ignoring the relatively minor modifications that arise in beta - stable neutral matter with its dilute admixture of protons .",
    "bcs theory @xcite furnishes a general framework for microscopic treatments of nucleonic pairing . as is the case for singlet pairing @xcite , two rather different problems",
    "must be overcome to realize a quantitative description of triplet pairing within this framework and make realistic predictions for the associated energy gap .",
    "the first problem to be solved is the construction of an accurate in - medium ( or `` effective '' ) particle - particle interaction that provides the pairing force , together with a consistent mass operator that provides the single - particle input for the bcs equation .",
    "the second problem is to solve the bcs gap equation ( actually a system of gap equations when one deals with @xmath21 ) , once the inputs for the pairing matrix and normal - state single - particle energies have been determined .",
    "this first task places great demands on even the most advanced tools of many - body theory . for @xmath0s@xmath1 pairing ,",
    "there exists a `` first generation '' of results on this facet of the problem , obtained by several different approaches ( landau fermi - liquid theory @xcite , the method of correlated basis functions @xcite , the polarization - potential approach @xcite and diagrammatic perturbation theory @xcite ) .",
    "however , little progress has been made on this aspect of @xmath2p@xmath3@xmath2f@xmath3 pairing , and the issue of modifications of the associated input pairing interaction and single - particle energies due to short- and long - range correlations inside the nuclear medium remains open .",
    "we shall not attempt to address this issue here .",
    "rather , we shall be concerned with the task of actually solving the triplet bcs system , assuming the particle - particle interaction is identical with the bare or vacuum @xmath11 interaction , and that the input single - particle energies needed to complete the bcs equation(s ) have the same form as for free particles ( perhaps with an effective mass ) .",
    "this problem also proves to be nontrivial , since we face essentially the same difficulties as in singlet s - wave pairing , and more :    1 .",
    "again , the kernel of the bcs gap equation(s ) has a pole at zero gap amplitude , implying an incipient logarithmic divergence .",
    "2 .   again",
    ", the nonlocality of the particle - particle interaction in momentum space implies slow convergence of the integral over momentum modulus @xmath22 in the bcs equation(s )  precluding application of the standard weak - coupling estimates of bcs theory @xcite .",
    "this feature of nucleonic pairing implies that one must integrate out to large values of the momentum variable .",
    "as already intimated , an additional complication of pairing in higher angular momentum states with @xmath21 arises from the ( possible ) angle - dependence of the gap , which can be parametrized in terms of dependences on the quantum numbers @xmath23 of the total and relative orbital angular momenta and on the magnetic quantum number @xmath24 associated with @xmath17 .",
    "one must deal with a set of coupled gap equations for the gap components @xmath25 in an expansion of the ( generally anisotropic ) gap in the spin - angle functions @xmath26 .",
    "the combination of difficulties ( a ) and ( b ) can make numerical solution of the gap equation(s ) a problematic exercise .",
    "to overcome these obstacles , a special procedure called the separation approach has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and applied to @xmath0s@xmath1 pairing . in this approach , the generic pairing matrix @xmath27 is decomposed , identically , into a separable part , plus a remainder whose every element vanishes when either momentum variable lies on the fermi surface .",
    "( as is characteristic of bcs theory , we assume that the particle - particle interaction is independent of frequency . ) applied to @xmath0s@xmath1 pairing , this separation procedure reduces the bcs gap equation to two equivalent coupled equations : a nonsingular , quasilinear integral equation for the shape of the gap function and a nonlinear equation determining its amplitude at the fermi surface .",
    "we hasten to point out that this strategy is by no means limited to the case where the pairing matrix elements are supplied by the bare @xmath11 interaction  it will retain its practical and analytical value when a realistic in - medium particle - particle interaction is employed .",
    "the primary aim of this article is to generalize the separation approach to pairing in an arbitrary angular momentum channel and apply it to @xmath2p@xmath3 pairing in neutron matter . since",
    ", according to consideration ( c ) above , we are now confronted  in general  with a set of coupled gap equations rather than a single one ,",
    "the situation is much more complicated than for @xmath0s@xmath1 pairing .",
    "however , in this case the power of the separation method becomes even more apparent .",
    "it enables a decomposition of the problem into ( i ) the determination of the shape of the gap function in @xmath22-space through an appropriate nonsingular quasilinear integral equation whose kernel is practically independent of the energy gap , and , once this is done , ( ii ) the determination of a set of numerical coefficients specifying the angular dependence of the gap through a system of nonlinear ` algebraic ' equations .    in both singlet and triplet cases ,",
    "the effectiveness of the separation scheme is greatly enhanced by the existence of a small parameter , given by the ratio of a suitable measure of the gap amplitude to the fermi energy .",
    "small - parameter expansions work well in the singlet problem , and even better in the triplet case .",
    "corrections to the leading order in a small - parameter expansion of the @xmath2p@xmath3@xmath2f@xmath3 energy gap are down by a factor @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "this property leads to considerable simplifications in the analytical and numerical treatment of the triplet problem , greatly ameliorating complication ( c ) .",
    "the separation approach is not merely a tool for numerical solution of gap equations .",
    "following the lead of refs .",
    "@xcite , we shall demonstrate its very important role in facilitating incisive analysis of the nature of pairing solutions in different angular momentum channels .",
    "in particular , the separation formalism provides a basis for establishing certain universal properties of @xmath2p@xmath3 pairing , properties that are independent of density and independent of the specifics of the pairing interaction itself , whether furnished by the in - vacuum or in - medium particle - particle interaction .",

    "the results presented explicitly include the critical upper density for gap closure , the momentum dependence of gap components , and the conventional average measure of the gap amplitude at the fermi surface , variously calculated for `` pure '' and tensor - coupled @xmath2p@xmath3 pairing , with and without use of the angle - average approximation .",

    "the sum over orbital momenta @xmath55 on the l.h.s . of ( [ gengap ] ) appears only when tensor forces are present and is then restricted by @xmath43 and parity conservation . on the other hand ,",
    "the sum over @xmath56 resulting from the angular dependence of the gap contains , in principle , an infinite number of terms .",
    "we identify the energy gap as @xmath57 and note that it is in general angle dependent and in general has nodes .",

    "we take this opportunity to caution the reader that the literature is inconsistent and sometimes vague in the choice of energy gap measure .",
    "care must be taken in interpreting statements about the magnitude of `` the gap . ''",
