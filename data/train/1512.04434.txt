    "the region is not expected to be much more compact than in this model , as no fast large - amplitude variability is seen from optical to x - ray wavelengths , despite the statistics being sufficient to detect doubling timescales as short as days .",
    "the region could still be further away from the black hole if its size was only fraction of the jet cross - section .",
    "the model parameters are similar to those obtained by @xcite , @xcite , , and for other fsrqs , but a remarkably high break energy in the electron spectrum is needed to explain the optical - to - x - ray synchrotron emission .",
