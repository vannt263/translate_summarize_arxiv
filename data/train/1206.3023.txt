    "in the context of the interaction of matter with strong laser fields , high - order harmonics generation ( hhg ) process  @xcite has attracted considerable interest , since it represents a viable route to the generation of coherent radiation in the ultraviolet ( uv ) to extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) spectral range with high repetition rate . due to this high repetition rate , as well as high coherence degree and wavelength tunability ,",
    "hhg has found numerous applications in various areas of science , such as material sciences , life sciences and lithography  @xcite .",
    "in addition , hhg has been employed for generating ultrashort pulses , and even single attosecond pulses  @xcite .",
    "this allows even more control over the atomic and molecular processes . for instant , by superposing the xuv pulses on the laser field , one can resolve dynamic processes in atoms or molecules with precision of a few attoseconds  @xcite .",
    "the physics behind the hhg can be understood by a simple semi - classical three - step model  @xcite . according to this picture ,",
    "an electron leaves the atom or molecule by tunneling through the potential barrier , formed by the atomic potential and the laser electric field , to reach the continuum .",
    "it subsequently propagates in the continuum and driven back by the laser filed toward its parent ion or molecule . finally , upon its return , it recombines with the core and leads to the emission of energetic photons .",
    "the threshold intensity for generating high - order harmonic in noble gases is above @xmath0 w/@xmath1 , which is far beyond the output power of the current femtosecond oscillators .",
    "nowadays , chirped - pulse amplification ( cpa ) is used to exceed the threshold intensity .",
    "cpa is a complex process and it requires multi - pass amplifier cavities in tandem . on the other hand ,",
    "as far as the applications of the hhg are concerned , the optimization of hhg efficiency and the extension of the cutoff to short - wavelength region are important aspects to consider  @xcite .",
    "the cutoff frequency of the generated harmonics can be extended either by reducing ( increasing ) the laser frequency ( wavelength ) or increasing the peak field amplitude",
    ". there is , however , limitations in tuning these parameters .",
    "in fact , reducing the laser frequency leads to a significant drop in the harmonic yield due to the longer electron excursion times @xcite , while increasing the laser field intensity produces depletion of the ground state .",
    "a recent demonstration has shown that the surface plasmon resonance could provide a possible solution to overcome the problems cited above  @xcite .",
    "the local field enhancement induced by a resonant plasmon within a metallic nanostructure requires no extra cavities or laser pumping for amplification . in this scheme ,",
    "the local electric fields can be intensified by more than 20 db @xcite , an amplification that exceed the threshold laser intensity for hhg generation in noble gases .",
    "in addition , the pulse repetition rate remains unchanged without adding any additional cavities or extra pumping .",
    "moreover , each nanostructure acts as a point - like source to generate harmonics radiation , which through constructive interference can provide even more focused coherent radiation .",
    "this gives a wide range of possibilities to spatially rearrange nanostructures to shape or enhance hhg spectral and even obtain a new physics .",
    "the locally enhanced field , has a distinct spatial dependency , which gives an enormous extension to the hhg cutoff  @xcite .",
    "hhg based on plasmonics can be understood as follows  @xcite : the external femtosecond low intensity pulse couples to the plasmon mode and induces a collective oscillation of free charges within the localized regions of the nanostructure .",
    "the free charges redistribute the electric field around the nanostructure vicinity , in such , to form a spot of highly enhanced electric field .",
    "the enhanced field , which largely depends on the geometrical shape of the metallic nanostructure , exceeds the threshold intensity required for hhg . as a result , by injection of noble gases into the spot of the enhanced field",
    ", one can generate high order harmonics . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the output of the femtosecond oscillator , which was a pulse with 10 fs pulse duration , 800 nm of wavelength and intensity of 10@xmath2 w/@xmath1 , was directly focused onto a bow - tie nanoantenna . as a result of the laser pulse interaction with the nanostructure , the field intensity is enhancement by 2 - 4 order of magnitude , which is sufficient enough to produce xuv wavelengths from the 7@xmath3 ( 114 nm ) to the 21@xmath4 ( 38 nm ) harmonics in argon .",
    "hitherto , the theoretical approaches for studying strong field phenomena are largely based on the assumption that the laser electric field is spatially homogeneous in the region where the electron motions take place  @xcite .",
    "this assumption , however , does not hold for the field enhanced by resonant plasmons .",
    "indeed , the strong confinement of the electrons in the plasmonic hot spots generates a spatially inhomogeneous electric field , which strongly influences the subsequent motion of the electrons in the strong field phenomena . as a result",
    ", new physics will emerge in the interaction between matter and strong laser fields .    since the first observation of hhg , different theoretical models , including solving the time dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) and the strong field approximation ( sfa ) ,",
    "have been applied to describe this phenomenon ( for details see the review articles in  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the hhg by resonant plasmon field enhancement is a new topic and it has been considerably less well studied since it is far more difficult to measure and model .",
    "up till now , two experiments have been performed to measure hhg based on this kind of field  @xcite , while only few theoretical approaches have been developed  @xcite .",
    "one should note , however , that the interpretation of ref  @xcite remains controversial  @xcite .    in our previous paper  @xcite , in which we employed sfa to investigate the hhg by resonant plasmon field enhancement , the vector potential field",
    "was defined in an approximated way starting from the inhomogeneous electric field . in the present paper ,",
    "we improve our model even more by applying the same approximation directly to the inhomogeneous electric field rather than the potential .",
    "subsequently , the vector potential is now derived from the electric field .",
    "in addition , we use a sfa based on saddle point methods rather than a full numerical sfa approach to obtain the hhg spectra .",
    "the saddle point methods lead to equations that can be directly related to the classical equations of motion of an electron in a laser field . as a result",
    ", they provide a space - time picture which gives us additional physical insight . in this work ,",
    "we scrutinize the individual electron trajectories in comparison to their classical counterparts and demonstrate their contributions to the hhg spectra .",
    "in addition , since the imaginary part of the saddle point equations can be related to the width of the potential barrier through which the electron tunnels , we examine the ionization probability of the electron for each trajectory .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the sfa transition amplitude for high - order harmonics , starting from common expressions based on homogeneous electric fields ( sec .",
    "ii.a ) and , subsequently , by showing how we modify it for the case with non - homogeneous fields ( sec .",
    "ii.b ) . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the saddle - point equations and analyze them in terms of quantum orbits in parallel to their classical counterpart electron trajectories . in the next section , iv , we present the hhg spectra based on the analysis given in sec .",
    "iii . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we summarize the paper and state our main conclusions .",
    "generally , there are two main assumptions behind the strong field approximation ( sfa ) , namely ( i ) the influence of the laser field is neglected when the electrons are bound to their target atoms and ( ii ) the binding ionic potential is neglected when the electrons are in the continuum . as a result ,",
    "the free electrons in the continuum are described by field - dressed plane waves , which are known as volkov states @xcite .      in the lewenstein model @xcite , a well established sfa - based method to model hhg , it is assumed that the laser electric field does not change with respect to the position in the region where the electron motion takes place . in this spatially homogeneous field ,",
    "the sfa transition amplitude for hhg reads ( in atomic units )    @xmath5    with the action @xmath6^{2}}{2}d\\tau + i_{p}(t - t^{^{\\prime } } ) -\\omega t   \\label{action}\\ ] ] and the prefactors @xmath7 @xmath8 thereby , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the drift momentum of the electron in the continuum , the ionization potential of the of the field - free bound state @xmath15 , the harmonic frequency , the interaction of the system with the laser field , the dipole operator and the laser polarization vector , respectively .",
    "the vector potential @xmath16 of the laser electric field @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 physically , eq .",
    "( [ mp ] ) describes a process in which an electron , initially in a bound state @xmath19 with energy @xmath10 , interacts with the laser field by @xmath20 at the time @xmath21 and tunnels into a volkov state @xmath22 .",
    "subsequently , from time @xmath21 to @xmath23 , it propagates in the continuum and is driven back by laser field to its parent ion . at the time @xmath23 , upon its return , this electron recombines with the core and emits high - harmonic radiation of frequency @xmath11 . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ mp ] ) , which corresponds to the continuum - continuum transitions , can be ignored , since it contributes very insignificant to the transition amplitude of hhg ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the main drawback of sfa is that it is not gauge invariant . as a result ,",
    "the matrix elements describing the ionization and recombination , i.e. eqs ( [ prefion ] ) and ( [ prefrec ] ) , have different form in the length and velocity gauges .",
    "this comes from the fact , that both the interaction hamiltonian @xmath20 and the volkov wave function @xmath24 and @xmath25/2 $ ] in the length and velocity gauges , respectively . for the volkov wave function ,  @xmath26 in the length gauge and @xmath27 in the velocity gauge . in this paper",
    ", we work in the length gauge and we assume that the electric field is linearly polarized along @xmath28-axis .",
    "furthermore , we consider an hydrogenic @xmath29 state for the field - free bound state @xmath30 .    as a result , the eqs .",
    "( [ prefion ] ) and ( [ prefrec ] ) yield @xmath31    @xmath32      we will now consider a case in which that assumption made in sec .",
    "homogenoufield is not any more valid and the laser field has a spatially inhomogeneous character , when the hhg process takes place . before discussing the nonhomogeneous case",
    ", we examine how the action of the sfa is connected to classical electron trajectories for the homogeneous field .",
    "the laser potential @xmath33 due to the laser field @xmath17 is defined as @xmath34 and the newton equation of motion for an electron in this field is given by @xmath35 in here , the force is equal to ( minus ) the laser electric field , i.e. @xmath36 . in the sfa ,",
    "the action is defined in terms of the vector potential field @xmath37 given by ( [ potentialfield ] ) , which is the counter part of the velocity @xmath38 .    for the inhomogeneous case the electric field now has the form @xmath39 and the laser potential is @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the newton equation of motions become @xmath41 from eq .",
    "( [ newton ] ) , it is clear that @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the potential field @xmath37 of the sfa action should correspond to the integration of @xmath43 with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "if the spatial dependence of the laser electric field is perturbative and linear with respect to position , then the field can be approximated as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a parameter that characterize the strength of the inhomogeneity .",
    "indeed , the above approximation corresponds to the first term of the actual field of a plasmonic nanostructure with spherical shape @xcite . by substituting ( [ nhmfield ] ) into ( [ newton ] ) , we have @xmath46 this is the effective laser electric field that the electron feels along the trajectory @xmath47 , which describes its motion in the continuum",
    ". we will call it the electron trajectory effective electric field .",
    "classically , the electron trajectory can be found by solving eq ( [ newtonh1 ] ) . in here , we solve it by applying the picard iteration @xcite method and restrict ourselves to the first order ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "based on the condition that the electron starts its movement at the origin with zero velocity , i.e. @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we obtain @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "in addition we assume that at time @xmath52 the potential field is zero ; thus @xmath53    by using eqs . ( [ potentialfield ] ) , ( [ newposition ] ) and ( [ newtonh1 ] )",
