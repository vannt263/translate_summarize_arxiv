    "the classic children s game of dots - and - boxes has been well studied in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "variations of the game may be played , such as dots - and - triangles , which is played on a triangular board shape , and the swedish and icelandic games , in which some edges are drawn before the game begins @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider @xmath0 ( `` narrow '' ) versions of both dots - and - boxes and dots - and - triangles .",
    "the @xmath0 dots - and - boxes game consists of two rows of @xmath3 dots each ; on completion of the game , @xmath2 boxes will have been enclosed .",

    "+ to simplify our analysis , we will consider the graph - theoretic dual version of dots - and - boxes / triangles known as strings - and - coins ; this dual version of the game is thoroughly presented by berlekamp in @xcite . in this dual game , each box or triangle in the original game corresponds to a vertex , or `` coin . ''",
    "two vertices are adjacent in the dual game if and only if their corresponding faces share an edge _ that has not yet been drawn _ in the original game . in addition , we think of the exterior of the game board as a single vertex called the `` ground . ''",
    "the ground vertex is not drawn .",
    "drawing an edge in the original game corresponds to removing an edge , or `` cutting a string , '' in the dual game . completing and claiming a face in the original game corresponds to isolating and taking the vertex , or `` capturing the coin , '' in the dual game .",

    "every face - enclosing game such as dots - and - boxes can be converted to an equivalent strings - and - coins game , although the converse is not true .",

    "following berlekamp s convention , we use small arrows to denote an edge that goes to the ground .",

    "the strategy we describe below is based on the notion of `` mirroring , '' whereby in a game with a symmetric scenario , one player can choose to mimic the other s moves , making use of the inherent symmetry of the game .",
    "in many games mirroring can be a means to force a tie , or to maintain an advantage , since both players perform identical actions and presumably obtain identical advantages .",
    "the dots games and their coin analogues do not have the necessary symmetries to make complete mirroring profitable , since on a turn in which a player captures a coin they would also capture its opposite , preserving the symmetry of the graph but not of the underlying game , wherein one player now has a score advantage .",
    "a limited mirroring - like approach can , however , serve to preserve certain properties of the game , and the strategy described here makes use of such a `` quasi - mirroring '' approach . for brevity and ease of reference , we refer to the first player in this strategy description as `` alice , '' and her opponent as `` bob .

    "whether @xmath2 is even or odd , bob must end this turn by removing an edge in the symmetric base graph . at the end of bob s first turn , alice s net score will thus be either @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",

    "we now argue that if bob takes an edge that is not part of a long chain ( as in the three possible moves described above ) , and if that edge is in a symmetric base graph , then alice s response moves detailed above are possible and will restore the base graph to symmetry at the end of her turn",
    ".    we shall presume by way of induction that on bob s turn , he is faced with a symmetric base graph with no double - dealing opportunity ; note that this is certainly the case on his first turn .",

    "if @xmath25 is a good edge , then since the base graph is symmetric , @xmath26 is either good or incident to a pendant .",
    "if @xmath26 is incident to a pendant , then alice will remove the pendant before taking @xmath26 , and then @xmath26 will be good when alice takes it .",
    "now suppose @xmath25 is a bad edge",
    ". then @xmath25 must be in a medium chain , since every edge of a short chain is good in dots - and - triangles .",

    "suppose @xmath25 is the middle edge of a medium chain and @xmath25 is incident to a pendant edge .",
    "since alice takes all available vertices before making a move in the base graph , the only pendant edges / vertices at the start of any of bob s turns must have been created by alice s most recent move , and so there can only be pendants on one side of the graph .",
    "therefore , if @xmath25 is incident to a pendant edge , @xmath26 is not .",
