    "frustration plays a central role in many complex systems , such as spin glasses@xcite and glass forming liquids@xcite . in spin glasses frustration",
    "arises because ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions are distributed in such a way that the spins can not simultaneously satisfy all interactions . in glass",
    "forming liquids frustration arises when local arrangements of molecules kinetically prevent all the molecules from reaching ordered close - packed configurations .",
    "in this paper we study a lattice - gas model which contains frustration as an essential ingredient .",
    "this model is the site version of the bond frustrated percolation model , which was defined in the context of the generalization of the kasteleyn - fortuin@xcite coniglio - klein@xcite cluster formulation to the spin glass model @xcite .",
    "more precisely consider the ising spin glass hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 are quenched random interactions which assume the values @xmath2 with equal probability . by introducing bond variables between each nearest - neighbour pair of spins , it is possible to show that the spin glass partition function can be expressed as a sum over bond configurations on the lattice @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the multiplicity of the spins , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the number of bonds and the number of clusters in the bond configuration @xmath8 .",
    "the asterisk in ( [ spinglass_z ] ) means that the sum extends over all the bond configurations that do not contain a `` frustrated loop '' .",
    "this is defined as a closed path of bonds which contains an odd number of antiferromagnetic interactions . in this formalism",
    "the spin glass problem is mapped on to a geometrical problem , which for @xmath9 corresponds to pack the highest number of bonds without closing frustrated loops .    for general values of @xmath10",
    "the model has been called `` q - bond frustrated percolation '' @xcite and the partition function ( [ spinglass_z ] ) can be obtained from an hamiltonian model in which , besides the ising spins interacting in a spin glass way , there are potts spins in each site , interacting ferromagnetically , with multiplicity @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the model exhibits two critical points for each value of @xmath10 : one at higher temperature @xmath12 , corresponding to the percolation transition , in the same universality class of the ferromagnetic potts model with multiplicity @xmath11 , and one at lower temperature @xmath13 , in the same universality class of the ising spin glass transition .",
    "this has been verified by renormalization methods @xcite , and numerically @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite , that for @xmath14 the percolation transition corresponds to a singularity in the partition function , and thus it corresponds to a real thermodynamic transition .",
    "each critical point is characterized by a diverging length , associated with the quantities@xcite :    @xmath15    and    @xmath16    here @xmath17 @xmath18 is the probability that 1 ) sites @xmath19 and @xmath20 are connected by at least one path of bonds , and 2 ) the phase @xmath21 defined as the product over all the signs @xmath22 along the path connecting @xmath19 and @xmath20 is @xmath23 @xmath24@xcite .",
    "the length @xmath25 associated with the pair connectedness function @xmath26 diverges at the percolation critical point , while the length @xmath27 associated with @xmath28 diverges at @xmath13 ( the bar represents the average over all possible interaction configurations @xmath29 ) . for @xmath4 the quantity @xmath30 in eq .",
    "[ gij ] coincides with the spin spin pair correlation function",
    ".    however we can give a geometrical interpretation of the second length @xmath27 . the second transition , like the quantum percolation transition@xcite ,",
    "occurs at a bond density higher than the usual percolation transition , due to the interference of paths with different phases . at high density",
    "the number of allowed configurations is extremely reduced and most of the configurations connecting a given pair of sites @xmath19 and @xmath20 will have a common path .",
    "we call this path a `` quasi frozen '' path , since in a dynamical sequence of configurations exploring the allowed phase space , this path will be present most of the time . in conclusion",
    "the major contribution to @xmath30 is due to those configurations in which @xmath19 and @xmath20 are connected by quasifrozen bonds@xcite and @xmath31 roughly coincides with the probability that @xmath19 and @xmath20 belong to the same quasifrozen cluster , and the length @xmath27 associated with @xmath28 roughly represents the linear dimension of these clusters .    for @xmath32 ( [ spinglass_z ] ) reduces to the bond frustrated percolation model , in which bonds are randomly distributed on the lattice , with the only constraint that configurations of bonds which contains at least one frustrated loop are not allowed@xcite .",
    "thus the model incorporates in the simplest way the concepts of geometrical frustration and could be applied to those systems , such as glass forming liquids , where geometrical frustration due to packing problems plays a central role .",
    "we note that in this model the disorder is quenched while in glass forming liquids this is not the case .",
    "however at low temperature or high density the relaxation times are so large that the disorder may be considered frozen in .    to better describe the particle nature of glassy systems , we have introduced in this paper the site version of the frustrated percolation model , in which sites can be full or empty .",
    "full sites can be seen as `` particles '' , and empty sites as vacancies .",
    "we leave unchanged the underlying structure of the interactions , and the constraint that no frustrated loop can be fully occupied .",
    "we consider in this paper only the @xmath32 case .    in sect .",
    "[ sec_model ] we introduce the model , and in sect .",
    "[ sec_montecarlo ] we describe two types of monte carlo dynamics ( thermalization and diffusion dynamics ) , used to simulate the model .",
    "we have studied the static properties of the system in sect .",
    "[ sec_percolation ] .",
    "in particular we have verified that the percolation transition is in the same universality class of the @xmath33 ferromagnetic potts model .",
    "the cooling rate dependence of the specific volume is considered in sect .",
    "[ sec_cooling ] , while in sect .",
    "[ sec_diffusion ] we analyse the diffusion dynamics of the model , evaluating the mean square displacement of the particles and the diffusion coefficient . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec_relaxation ] we evaluate the autocorrelation functions of density fluctuations , both in thermalization and diffusion dynamics , which show a behaviour typical of glass forming liquids . in the appendix",
    "we describe in more detail the monte carlo procedure .",
    "in the site frustrated percolation ( sfp ) model particles are introduced on the vertices of a regular lattice .",
    "we assign to each edge of the lattice an interaction @xmath34 , positive or negative according to a random quenched distribution .",
    "like in spin glasses a frustrated loop is a closed path of edges which contains an odd number of negative interactions .",
    "a particle configuration is forbidden only if it contains a fully occupied frustrated loop@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ site_percolation ] ) .",
    "thus we assign zero weight to all configurations of particles which contain at least one fully occupied frustrated loop , and to all other configurations a weight @xmath35 where @xmath6 is the number of particles in the configuration @xmath8 , @xmath36 is the chemical potential of the particles and @xmath37 .",
    "the partition function of the model is given by @xmath38 where the sum excludes forbidden configurations .",
    "note that there is only one independent parameter @xmath39 , which can vary from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "frustration prevents the system from reaching maximum density @xmath42 for @xmath43 : when @xmath39 varies from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , the density @xmath44 varies from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .    the sfp model is expected to have two critical points , in analogy to the bond case @xcite . fixing the value of @xmath36 to a positive value , and varying the temperature from high to low values , there is a first critical point at a temperature @xmath47 , corresponding to the percolation transition , and one at lower temperature @xmath48 , corresponding to a spin glass transition .",
    "the percolation transition is expected to be in the same universality class of the ferromagnetic @xmath33 ferromagnetic potts model , while in two dimensions @xmath48 is expected to occur at @xmath9 .    at low temperature",
    "the model is expected to have the characteristic features of a spin glass system , such as a rough free energy landscape , very long relaxation times due to the high free energy barriers , and many ground states at @xmath9 .",
    "we have realised two types of monte carlo dynamics to simulate the sfp model .",
    "the first , which we call `` thermalization dynamics '' , proceeds through the following steps :    * pick up a site at random ; * if the site is filled by a particle , destroy that particle with probability @xmath49 , or leave the site filled with probability @xmath50 ; * if the site is empty , leave it empty if a new particle placed in that site would close a frustrated loop otherwise , if the particle would not close a frustrated loop , create a new particle in that site with probability @xmath51 , or leave the site empty with probability @xmath52 .    looking at the partition function ( [ site_z ] ) , it is easy to verify that the following probabilities of creating or destroying a particle satisfy the principle of detailed balance :    @xmath53    @xmath54    this dynamics is clearly ergodic , because we can go from a permitted configuration @xmath55 to a permitted configuration @xmath56 , first destroying the particles belonging to @xmath55 , and then creating those belonging to @xmath56 .",
    "the difficult step here is to verify that a new particle does nt close a frustrated loop , since this involves a non local check .",
    "the procedure is described in the appendix .",
    "the second type of monte carlo dynamics , which we call `` diffusion dynamics '' , starts from a site configuration with some density @xmath57 of particles , obtained by thermalization dynamics , and proceeds by letting the particles diffuse conserving their number . at each step",
    "a site is chosen at random ; if the site is filled , we make an attempt to move the particle to a nn site .",
    "the move is accepted if the probed site is empty and no frustrated loop is closed .",
    "in this section we analyse the percolation properties of the model .",
    "the analysis of the data confirms that the percolation transition , for the site frustrated percolation problem , is in the same universality class of the ferromagnetic @xmath33 potts model , as was formerly verified for the bond problem @xcite .",
    "we have used the histogram method for analyzing data @xcite . for various lattice sizes , we simulated the system using thermalization dynamics for 10 temperatures around the percolation point .",
    "for each temperature we reached equilibrium by taking @xmath58 steps , and then evaluated the histograms of the following quantities , taking @xmath59 steps :    * density of particles @xmath57 ; * probability of existence of a spanning cluster @xmath60 ; * mean cluster size @xmath61 .",
    "the mean cluster size is defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number of clusters having size @xmath64 in the system .    using the histogram method @xcite",
    ", we evaluated the values of these three quantities for an entire interval of the parameter @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "[ percolation_fss ] is shown the finite size scaling of @xmath60 and of @xmath61 , from which it is possible to extract the values of the critical temperature , and of the critical exponents @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the data are perfectly compatible with the values @xmath67 , @xmath68 , of the @xmath33 potts model @xcite .",
    "the critical ( percolation ) value for @xmath39 is found to be @xmath69 , which corresponds to a density @xmath70 which is , within the error , not different from the percolation density of the standard random site percolation , @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "we evaluated the equilibrium density of the sfp , varying the parameter @xmath39 from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , with rate @xmath74 step@xmath75 . the result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ eq_density ] . for comparison we plot also the equilibrium density of the unfrustrated model , which is given by @xmath76 .",
    "this curve fits quite well the low density part , since for low density the effect of frustration is negligible .",
    "the high density part instead is better fitted by the function @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "note from fig .",
    "[ eq_density ] that the crossover occurs at a value of @xmath39 , close to the percolation threshold .",
    "the effect of frustration prevents the system from _ easily _ reaching the equilibrium density , especially at very high values of the parameter @xmath39 , that is for @xmath81 .",
    "fixing @xmath36 to a positive value , and cooling the temperature from high to low values with a finite cooling rate , there is a temperature @xmath82 at which the system goes out of equilibrium . lowering further the temperature , the density remains constant to the value corresponding to the temperature @xmath82 .",
    "[ cooling_rates ] shows the temperature dependence of the density for various cooling rates .",
    "temperature goes from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , and cooling rates range from @xmath85 step@xmath75 to @xmath86 step@xmath75 .",
    "one step is one update per site .",
    "this behaviour is experimentally observed in supercooled glass - forming liquids , at the calorimetric glass transition temperature @xmath82 , when structural relaxation times become greater than the experimental observation times @xcite . as in glass forming liquids ,",
    "in the model we observe that the faster the cooling rate , the greater are the glass transition temperature and the specific volume .",
    "we have then studied the diffusion dynamics ( conserved number of particles ) of the system .",
    "the diffusion process is severely hindered by kinetic constraints at high density , and particles can diffuse through the system only by a large scale cooperative rearrangement of many particles . at low density",
    "we expect that the effect of frustration on the diffusion is very weak because of abundance of holes , and particles diffuse freely on the lattice .",
    "we have evaluated the mean square displacement ( msd ) @xmath87 as a function of time @xmath88 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mean_sd ] .",
    "each curve is obtained averaging over all the particles and over a time interval of 5000 steps . as expected for low density",
    "the curves show a linear behaviour , which corresponds to normal diffusion . for high densities ,",
    "the msd reaches a plateau and then becomes again linearly dependent on time .",
    "this behaviour is typical of glass forming liquids and is also observed in molecular dynamics simulations@xcite .",
    "the crossover from the normal behaviour to the anomalous diffusion in our model again occurs at a density value close to percolation .",
    "we have extrapolated the diffusion coefficient values @xmath89 from the long time regime which are shown in fig .",
    "[ diffusion_fit ] .",
    "the extrapolated values are very well fitted by a power law as function of density . @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "note that @xmath93 is equal within the errors to @xmath94 , the density corresponding to the ground state , as extracted from the fit ( [ density_fit ] ) .",
    "thus the dynamic singularity coincides in this model to the spin glass transition , which in two dimensions occurs at @xmath9 . if we set @xmath95 , using eq .",
    "( [ density_fit ] ) we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ d_fit ] ) @xmath96 which shows that the diffusion coefficient goes to zero with an arrhenius law for @xmath97 .",
    "the picture which emerges from the model is that particles are trapped most of the time in cages formed by their nn , and can diffuse only into localized pockets . only after a very long interval of time",
    "they have the opportunity of escaping from the cage , falling in a `` next neighbour '' cage .",
    "this process forms a kind of random walk , reflected in the long time linear dependence of the msd functions .",
    "this picture is enforced by direct observation of the particles moving on the lattice .",
    "we have taken `` snapshots '' of the system at particular times , for diffusion dynamics at two high values of the density .",
    "some particles leave tracks on the lattice , so we can analyze also the path they have walked . in fig .",
    "[ diffusion_path ] is shown the snapshot at @xmath98 after 2000 steps ( a ) , after 4000 steps ( b)and at @xmath99 after 2000 steps ( c )    we mark with dots the particles that moved at least one time ( non frozen domains ) during the time of the simulation ; the filled circles represents frozen domains .",
    "clusters of frozen particles prevent other particles from moving freely .",
    "we note that frozen particles are clustered and we can distinguish liquid - like zones ( holes and mobile particles ) from solid - like zones ( frozen clusters ) .",
    "frozen clusters are eroded as the time of the simulation gets longer , while liquid - like zones grow .    at the very high density ,",
    "frozen particles remain blocked for extremely long times . the frozen cluster in fig . [ diffusion_path](c ) , corresponding to density @xmath100 , is still frozen after @xmath101 steps which corresponds to the maximum time we have observed .",
    "we have checked that the large frozen cluster does not percolate in either direction , even if the density of the frozen particles is much greater than the percolation density of the random site percolation .",
    "we expect that the frozen particles in fact percolate at @xmath9 ( @xmath102 ) since the linear dimension of the frozen cluster should correspond roughly to the correlation length associated to @xmath30 ( [ gij ] ) , which for @xmath103 is expected to diverge at @xmath104 , as explained in the introduction .",
    "an important property that characterizes glassy behaviour is the form of the relaxation functions @xcite .",
    "we have evaluated the relaxation functions of the system , in the thermalization and in the diffusion dynamics .",
    "for each temperature , we reach the equilibrium , and then evaluate the relaxation functions averaging on a time interval of @xmath105 steps .",
    "[ correl_term ] shows the density - density autocorrelation function in the thermalization dynamics , defined as @xmath106 where @xmath107 .    for diffusion dynamics",

    "the autocorrelation functions corresponding to @xmath117 and @xmath118 are reported in fig .",
    "[ correl_diff ] .",
    "[ correl_self ] shows the self - part of the relaxation function in the diffusion dynamics , defined as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the number of particles .    at low temperatures , below the percolation threshold",
    ", we observe the onset of non - exponential decay .",
    "this is usually the sign of non - stochastic cooperative relaxation in the system .",
    "we emphasize that , for our model , the percolation transition corresponds to a real thermodynamic transition , and therefore it is possible to expect , below this point , a change in the dynamical properties of the system .    at very high density",
    "it is evident the existence of different time regimes as predicted by the _",
    "mode mode coupling _ theory @xcite of supercooled liquids and observed both in some molecular dynamic simulations and in some experimental measurement @xcite on glass forming liquids .",
    "there is a first short time relaxation , corresponding to relaxation inside non frozen domains surrounded by a frozen `` cage '' , and a long time regime ( @xmath111 relaxation ) , corresponding to structural rearrangement and final decay to equilibrium .",
    "we have studied a frustrated lattice gas model which it has been called site frustrated percolation since percolation plays an important role . this model , despite its simplicity , shows a complex dynamical behaviour .",
    "disorder and frustration are its basic ingredients .",
    "the constraint of frustration prevents the system from easily reaching high density , and inhibits the motion of particles at high density .",
    "we observed that the dependence of the volume as function of the temperature varies strongly with the cooling rate , qualitatively in the same way as observed in real glass forming liquids .",
    "the motion of particles in diffusion dynamics is severely hindered by the frustration constraint , and the relaxation process can take place only through large scale rearrangement .",
    "the cooperative nature of the motion is reflected in the behaviour of the mean square displacement and in the relaxation functions of the system .",
    "the plateau observed in the self part of relaxation functions ( fig .",
    "[ correl_self ] ) and in the mean square displacement ( fig .",
    "[ mean_sd ] ) , are intrinsically connected , and are the sign of the glassy nature of the dynamical properties of the model . in all these phenomena the crossover from a normal behaviour to an anomalous behaviour occurs close to or at the percolation threshold .",
    "since sfp seems to well describe the glass transition in glass forming liquids , the model suggests that the presence of a percolation type transition may be a general feature below which frustration effects start to be manifested",
    ". this transition may be responsible of various precursor phenomena @xcite , such as onset of stretched exponentials , breakdown of stokes - einstein relation , presence of spatial heterogeneity .",
    "the presence of a percolation transition well above the glass transition has recently been discovered by tomida and egami @xcite in a molecular dynamic simulation of monatomic liquids .",
    "it is also interesting to note that kivelson et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the viscosity of 15 glass forming liquids could be collapsed on one single curve , by assuming only one characteristic temperature well above the glass transition .",
    "finally the ideal glass transition temperature , characterized by the divergence of the inverse of the diffusion coefficient , numerically seems consistent with the divergence of the static length @xmath27 associated to @xmath30 ( [ gij ] ) .",
    "although we have discussed the site frustrated percolation model in the context of glassy systems , the model is rather generic and may be applied to other systems , where geometrical frustration plays an essential role .",
    "in fact recently the model has been successfully applied also to granular materials @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank v. cataudella , f. di liberto , s.c.glotzer , m. nicodemi and u. pezzella for interesting discussions .",
    "this work has been supported in part by cnr .",
    "as mentioned in sect . [ sec_montecarlo ] , we describe here the procedure to check whether a new particle , added to the system in a given configuration , closes or not a frustrated loop .",
    "every nearest neighbour ( nn ) particle ( occupied site ) of the empty site , that has been probed to be filled , belongs to a ( not necessarily distinct ) cluster of connected sites .",
    "if two particles nn to the empty site belong to the same connected cluster , then a new particle filling that site closes a loop . more precisely ,",
    "if @xmath121 is the number of particles nn to the empty site , and @xmath122 is the number of _ distinct _ clusters to which they belong , than the total number of new loops closed by the new particle is @xmath123 .",
    "* we count the number @xmath121 of particles nn to the empty site which we want to fill , and mark each of them as the root of a distinct cluster , so at the beginning @xmath124 , and @xmath125 ; * we grow every cluster in parallel , adding to it in recursive way its still not visited nn particles , and marking them as belonging to that cluster ; * if no nn particle to a cluster is found , that cluster is marked as `` burnt '' , and is not considered anymore ;",
    "* if two clusters collide , we say we have found a loop , and the two clusters merge to form a single cluster ; then @xmath126 is increased by one , and @xmath122 is decreased by one .",
    "every new visited site is marked in two ways : with the label of the cluster to which it belongs , and with the `` parity '' , that is the number of antiferromagnetic interactions walked through starting from the initial empty site .",
    "we stop the iteration when one of the following circumstances happens :    * two clusters collide and the parities do nt correspond ( that is one is odd and the other is even ) : in this case we have found a frustrated loop ; * the number of burnt clusters equals @xmath127 ( only one cluster is non - burnt ) : in this case no other loop can be found .",
    "when the density of particles is low , this algorithm is very fast , since the clusters are very low sized , and are burnt within few iterations . on the other side ,",
    "when the density is high , the maximum number of independent loop is found quickly as well .",
    "the algorithm can become slow when the density of particles is intermediate , notably near the percolation transition , because clusters in this case are very ramified . in fig . [ cpu_times ] the cpu time needed to do a single site update is shown for a square bidimensional system , and for various lattice dimensions . the maximum time is reached near the percolation transition , and scales as @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the total number of sites .",
