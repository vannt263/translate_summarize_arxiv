    "multiferroic materials , exhibiting both ferroelectricity and magnetic order in the same phase , are of particular interest for their potential technological applications . one of the current trends in the search for new multiferroic compounds is , starting from a ferroelectric host , to incorporate magnetically active species and check whether it is ( anti)ferromagnetic and insulating . an alternative way to predict multiferroic behavior is from material computational design , that is the prediction of multiferroic properties using first - principles techniques prior to their experimental verification .  @xcite examples of this methodology include the prediction of a ferroelectric instability in bimno@xmath1 ,  @xcite several unstable phonon branches in bicro@xmath1 ,  @xcite structural instabilities of camno@xmath1 @xcite and the properties of as - yet - unsynthesized 3@xmath5 - 5@xmath5 double perovskites .",
    "@xcite    between the ferroelectric materials , aurivillius layered perovskites are good trials for multiferroics .",
    "described by the formula [ bi@xmath6o@xmath6][a@xmath8b@xmath9o@xmath10 , they are formed by stacking fluorite blocks of bi@xmath6o@xmath6 with @xmath11 perovskitelike blocks .",
    "various @xmath12 and @xmath4 cations are allowed , so that this family has numerous representatives .",
    "archetype compounds are bi@xmath6wo@xmath13 ( n=1 ) , srbi@xmath6ta@xmath6o@xmath14 ( n=2 ) and bi@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( n=3 ) .",
    "recently some experimental groups have synthesized aurivillius compounds incorporating magnetic ions at the @xmath4-site .",
    "the underlying idea was the substitution of magnetic transition metal cations into the central octahedron layer of the perovskite - type block , while maintaining ferroelectric displacements in the outer octahedron layers .",
    "for that reason , those works involved high - order aurivillius phases ( n@xmath153 ) , such as bi@xmath16ti@xmath1feo@xmath17 ,  @xcite bi@xmath13ti@xmath1fe@xmath6o@xmath18 ,  @xcite and bi@xmath16ti@xmath1cro@xmath17 .",

    "_ reported ferroelectric behavior in a family of transition metal substituted three - layer aurivillius phases , formulated bi@xmath19sr@xmath20(nb / ta)@xmath20m@xmath21o@xmath2 ( x @xmath22 0.5 , m = ru@xmath23 , ir@xmath23 or mn@xmath23 ) , showing that these compounds have the same orthorhombic symmetry and similar dielectric and ferroelectric properties as their ( non - magnetic ) ferroelectric parent compounds .",
    "@xcite several investigations have been based on the incorporation of perovskite like lafeo@xmath1 , bimno@xmath1 , and bifeo@xmath1 into a bi@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 matrix .",
    "@xcite however , one can find that the reported magnetic properties in these materials are quite weak even at low temperature .",
    "the modification of bi@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ceramics was also investigated by substituting their cations partly with gd ,  @xcite fe ,  @xcite and mn .",
    "@xcite    in spite of the large amount of experimental work showing that the generic structure of aurivillius phases has the potential to serve as a template for multiferroic behavior , theoretical studies that help to clarify the effect of magnetic species in the aurivillius structure are missing . in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects of the substitution of ti ions by magnetically active mn@xmath3 ions at the @xmath4 sites of bi@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bit ) , which is a prototypical aurivillius compound with bismuth also occupying the perovskite @xmath12 site .",
    "bit has received tremendous attention during the last decade , especially in the thin film form , due to its promise in nonvolatile ferroelectric random access memory applications .",
    "@xcite it has a reasonably large spontaneous polarization ( @xmath24 50 @xmath25c/@xmath26 ) , a high curie temperature ( 950 k ) , and fatigue resistance on pt electrodes .",
    "its complex crystal structure can be described in terms of relatively small perturbations from a high - symmetry body - centered tetragonal structure ( space group symmetry i4/mmm ) , which contains only one formula unit per primitive cell .",
    "two main distortions from this tetragonal ( paraelectric ) structure lead to the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase .",
    "first , the ions displace along the [ 110 ] axis of the tetragonal structure .",
    "second , the tio@xmath13 octahedral rotate around the @xmath27 and @xmath28 axes .  @xcite the first distortion is directly responsible for the observed macroscopic polarization along the orthorhombic @xmath27 direction ( [ 110 ] axis of the tetragonal structure ) .    specifically , we performed density - functional theory calculations to investigate the hypothetical three - layer aurivillius compound bi@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bim ) , which results from substituting the three @xmath4-site ti@xmath23 cations with mn@xmath23 in the bit lattice .",
    "we predict structural , electronic and magnetic properties of bim , deepening the understanding of the effects of magnetic species in the aurivillius structure of bit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe computational details .",
    "results are presented in sec .",
    "iii . within this section",
    "we compare our bim results with those of bit from previous works and also with results we have obtained .",
    "first , the tetragonal structure of bim is optimized and the electronic structure and magnetic order of this phase are discussed .",
    "then we focus on the two more unstable modes of bit : the zone - center @xmath29 modes related to the polar instability and the zone - boundary @xmath30 modes related to oxygen antiferrodistortive ( afd ) distortions .",
    "we inspect then the energy landscape along the unstable modes directions and find that by replacing the ti cations with mn , the polar @xmath29 mode is overcome by the @xmath30 mode .",
    "finally , we investigate the possibility of favoring the ferroelectric distortion by strain and chemical engineering .",
    "we performed standard first - principles calculations using density - functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) with the perdew , burke and ernzerhof  @xcite parametrization as implemented in the vasp-4.6 code .",
    "@xcite the projector augmented wave potentials were used including explicitly 15 valence electrons for bi ( 5@xmath31 6@xmath32 6@xmath33 ) , 13 for mn ( 3@xmath34 , 3@xmath35 , 4@xmath32 ) , 10 for ti ( 2@xmath34 , 3@xmath36 , 4@xmath37 ) and 6 for oxygen ( 2@xmath32 , 2@xmath38 ) .",
    "convergence with respect to the @xmath39-point mesh was achieved using a 6@xmath406@xmath406 @xmath41-centered grid . for a proper treatment of strongly localized mn @xmath5 electrons",
    ", we used the on - site coulomb correction ( gga+@xmath42 ) in the dudarev implementation with parameter @xmath43 .",
    "@xcite except for the calculations done to determine the magnetic ground - state , where different u@xmath44 values were used to check the energy differences between spin configurations , all other calculations were performed using the mentioned value .    using a 19-atom body - centered - tetragonal unit cell with space group i4/mmm",
    ", we relax all degrees of freedom ( lattice parameters and internal coordinates along the stacking direction @xmath45 ) for spin polarized structures . we optimized the ground state structures with a plane - wave cutoff of 600  ev which yielded good convergence and , hence , was also used for the rest of the calculations . to search for the presence of ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive instabilities in the tetragonal paraelectric structure",
    ", we determined the phonon frequencies and eigenvectors of the infrared - active @xmath29 and rotational @xmath30 modes , which are the main unstable modes of bit . to this end , we calculated atomic forces of symmetry - adapted configurations determined with the help of the isotropy software,@xcite where selected atoms are displaced by 0.01    along the @xmath46 , @xmath47 and/or @xmath48 direction . to compute the @xmath30 modes , in particular ,",
    "the primitive cell was doubled to a 38-atom conventional tetragonal cell . from the forces as a function of displacements , a dynamical matrix of 11@xmath4011 ( 8@xmath408 ) for @xmath29 ( @xmath30 )",
    "symmetry was constructed and diagonalized .",
    "once the eigenvectors have been determined , we evaluate the total energy as a function of the displacement pattern of the unstable ( imaginary frequency ) modes .",
    "those curves will provide the ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive instability energy associated with a particular phonon mode .",
    "we begin by describing the optimized tetragonal structure of bim .",
    "the minimized lattice parameters are a = 3.811    and c = 32.613   .",
    "these values are smaller than those we compute for bit using gga : a = 3.842    and c = 33.241   , which in turn differ slightly from the experimental values reported in the literature ( a = 3.8633    and c = 33.2942  ,@xcite and a = 3.850    and c = 32.832  )@xcite .",
    "as seen the replacement of ti@xmath23 ions with mn@xmath23 shrinks the equilibrium volume of the unit cell , which is consistent with the fact that six coordinated mn@xmath23 has an ionic radius ( 0.67   ) smaller than that of ti@xmath23 ( 0.745   )",
    ". this chemical substitution would be analogous to applying pressure on bit and one could expect , following the general trend in many perovskite oxides , a strong sensitivity of the ferroelectric instability to volume .      in the perovskitelike blocks of the tetragonal structure , by symmetry there is one central mn@xmath23 ion [ mn(1 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : auriv - struct ] ] and two equivalent mn@xmath23 ions above and below the central layer , mn(2 ) . in the optimized structure of bim , the two mn(2 ) cations are pushed away along the @xmath28-axis from the center of each oxygen octahedron towards the fluorite blocks .",
    "besides , the oxygen octahedral around these mn(2 ) ions are considerably elongated along the @xmath28-axis , opposite to the undistorted central octahedron . the @xmath12-site bi@xmath49 ions [ bi(1 ) ] also move towards the fluorite blocks , that is , they approach the o(2 ) ions , moving away from the o(1 ) ions .",
    "table  [ tab : posi ] lists the optimized internal atomic positions of bim . for comparison ,",
    "we include our gga results for bit and the respective experimental values from ref .  .",
    "as seen the internal coordinates in both compounds are similar .        based on the existence of the polar instability in tetragonal bim ( although it is overcame by the rotational distortion ) , we investigate to what extent it would be possible to favor ferroelectricity by the application of epitaxial strain .",
    "we analyze two different structures around the equilibrium volume with in - plane lattice parameter , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the lattice parameters obtained by fixing the in - plane lattice constants , and fully relaxing @xmath28 and the atomic positions , are listed in table  [ tab : st ] .",
    "figure [ fig : ene_bimstr ] displays the energy landscape of the strained structures and compares them with the stress - free one .",
    "as expected , the in - plane @xmath29 mode ( left panel ) is favored by tensile bi - axial strain , whereas the afd @xmath30 instability ( right panel ) is disfavored .",
    "this behavior , which is typical in @xmath52o@xmath1 perovskite oxides , indicates that epitaxial strain seems to be an appropriate route to induce ferroelectricity in this aurivillius compound .",
    "however , it can be estimated by extrapolating the above data that it is necessary to apply a strain of @xmath53 to favor the polar mode over the antiferrodistortive distortion .",
    "this crudely estimated value is out of the range of strains usually accessible through epitaxial growth .",
    "( left panel ) and @xmath30 ( right panel ) .",
    "energy differences relative to the optimized tetragonal structure for @xmath54 ( filled lines ) , @xmath50 ( dashed lines ) , and @xmath51 ( dotted lines ) using the eigenvectors obtained at the equilibrium volume .",
    "open symbols correspond to bit at the bim equilibrium volume . ]    since applying a large epitaxial strain is not easily achievable in practice , we instead explore the possibility of making bim ferroelectric under a partial substitution of mn by ti . as a first test , we take the bim equilibrium structure and replace all of the mn ions with ti",
    "; that is , we analyze bit at the bim equilibrium volume . the resulting energy curves are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ene_bimstr ] with open symbols . by comparing them with the bim curves ( filled lines ) , we see that effectively the presence of the ti ions favors the polar instability and considerably decreases the afd one .",
    "we can then speculate that a partial substitution of mn with ti would also favor ferroelectricity .",
    "to support this idea we check the energetics of the aurivillius compounds bi@xmath0(timn@xmath6)o@xmath2 with the @xmath4 sites in the perovskitelike layer occupied by one ti at the central octahedron , and two mn ions in the external ones .",
    "we set the lattice parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 by interpolating those values between the optimized bim and bit ones .",
    "we find that the polar mode @xmath29 indeed is more unstable than the afd one by @xmath24 3.8  mry / f.u . , which shows that the ti ion at the central octahedron plays an important role in stabilizing the ferroelectric mode over the afd one .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the two modes of interest , as described above , are localized in the center of the perovskite slab .",
    "we think that this particular solid solution deserves a more detailed study in the future .",
    "nevertheless , we can conclude that our results indicate that , not only the cell volume , but also the nature of the transition metal ion is indeed relevant for the stabilization of the ferroelectric phase in aurivillius compounds .",
    "therefore , it would be also interesting to further investigate the effect of magnetic species with higher ionic radius than mn@xmath23 , such as ru@xmath23 and v@xmath23 .    in summary ,",
    "we have investigated from first - principles the effects of magnetic mn species in the aurivillius structure of bi@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "specifically we explored the possibility of finding multiferroic behavior in the hypothetical aurivillius compound bi@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 , which results from replacing the ti with mn ions .",
    "we have found that the paraelectric tetragonal structure of this material presents ferromagnetic order and structural instabilities similar to bit .",
    "we have shown , however , that the presence of mn ions shrinks the cell volume , and the polar mode associated with the in - plane ferroelectric polarization , is overcame by an antiferrodistortive distortion . in this way , bi@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 exhibits incipient ferroelectricity at its equilibrium volume .",
    "we have seen that although it is possible to favor the polar state by the application of epitaxial strain , the necessary strain value is not easily achievable in practice .",
    "our results indicate that the partial substitution of mn with ti is a fruitful alternative to favor the ferroelectric distortion , highlighting the relevant role played by the nature of the transition metal ion .",
    "we thus hope that our findings may be useful to better understand the multiferroic properties of aurivillius compounds .",
