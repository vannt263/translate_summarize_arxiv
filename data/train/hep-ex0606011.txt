    "the data collected correspond to @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 resonance decays , respectively .",
    "in addition , babar and belle have begun to analyze their wealth of data also with a view towards bound upsilon states , and have come out with exciting new results .",
    "this report reviews highlights from the following subjects :  ( i ) e1 photon transitions ,  ( ii ) `` unusual '' hadronic transitions ,  ( iii ) decay to charmonium ,  ( iv ) radiative decays of the ,  ( v ) precision measurements of and , and ( vi ) dipionic cascade transitions an old topic on which cleo iii as well as babar and belle have just shed new light .",
    "photon transitions between bound upsilon states probe quarkonium potential models .",
    "in particular , measurement of transition energies and branching fractions probe the spin dependence and the magnitude of relativistic corrections .",
    "cleo iii has recently performed a definitive study@xcite of the e1 transitions , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "as one example of the sensitivity achieved , the branching fraction for the decay @xmath7 was measured to be @xmath8% .",
    "this allowed to discriminate between various theoretical models the predictions of which ranged between 0.006 and 0.74% .",
    "another highlight has been the discovery of the @xmath9 state@xcite , the first new upsilon state in 20 years and the first long - lived @xmath10 meson below open - flavor threshold .",
    "the mass difference between this @xmath11 state and the turned out to be one of ten `` golden '' experimental input quantities against which to test new , unquenched lqcd calculations@xcite .",
    "this test has been spectacularly successful .",
    "hadronic cascade transitions between upsilon states test models of soft gluon emission with subsequent hadronization into light hadrons @xcite . from the late 1970s until recently , the only observed such hadronic cascades had been dipion transitions between triplet s states .",
    "now , results on two different types of hadronic cascades have been reported .",
    "this is the first observation of a non - pionic cascade transition between @xmath13 states , made by cleo iii via the channel , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the final state consists of @xmath17 .",

    "the energy distribution of the photon associated with the @xmath18 shows two peaks corresponding , respectively , to the @xmath19 and @xmath20 levels of ( the cascade via the @xmath21 level is kinematically forbidden ) .",
    "cleo iii measures the branching fractions for @xmath22 to be 1.6% and 1.1% for @xmath20 and @xmath19 , respectively@xcite . considering the tight available phase space",
    "these branching fractions are very large , in agreement with an early prediction by gottfried@xcite .",
    "a discussion of the spin dependence is given by voloshin@xcite .",
    "this is the first observation of a dipion cascade between non - s states , made by cleo iii via the cascade , @xmath24 , with @xmath16 .",
    "the final state consists of @xmath25 .",
    "the experimental challenge lies in the fact that the pions are very soft and that the main background process , @xmath26 with @xmath4 where @xmath27 as before , has identical final state particles with very similar kinematics .",
    "cleo iii applied two analysis methods , one in which both pions are detected ( low statistics / low background ) and one in which only one pion is detected and the other one is inferred from kinematic constraints ( higher statistics / higher background ) .",
    "they observe the cascade transition as a @xmath28 effect@xcite and obtain the partial width ,   @xmath29 , consistent with the prediction of  @xmath30 by kuang & yan @xcite .",
    "this decay tests models of charmonium production in gluon - rich environments , in particular the color - octet@xcite and color - singlet@xcite models , both of which predict a branching fraction and the shape of the inclusive momentum distribution .",
    "cleo iii studied this process using their data sample of @xmath1 which is a nearly twentyfold increase in statistics over the only earlier measurement , by cleo ii , of more than a decade ago .",
    "cleo iii select events with inclusive high - momentum lepton pairs .",
    "they observe clean signals in both the and the channel @xcite .",
    "the measured branching fraction , @xmath32 , favors the color - octet model .",
    "the observed momentum spectrum , however , is significantly softer than predicted by the color - octet model and also softer  although closer to  that predicted by the color - singlet model , indicating final state interactions not included in either model .",
    "inclusive production of @xmath33 and @xmath34 in decay is also observed .",
    "in this type of decay the light hadron pair is produced in a gluon - rich environment .",
    "it is an ideal source of glueballs should those exist . scaling from the where",
    "these decays have been studied extensively , to the the rates are expected to be suppressed by a factor of @xmath36 and the branching fractions by a factor of @xmath37 .",
    "cleo iii has studied these decays , as well as the @xmath38 final state which is free of @xmath39 continuum background .",
    "they fit the observed struture in the @xmath40 invariant mass distribution with relativistic , spin - dependent breit - wigner curves .",
    "the main results @xcite are the following .",
    "( i ) the @xmath41 is confirmed in the @xmath42 channel , and from a fit within the helicity formalism the spin assignment , @xmath19 , is established .",
    "( ii ) the @xmath43 is observed in the @xmath44 channel , also as @xmath19 .",
    "( iii ) the rates are consistent with expectations based on scaling from the .",
    "( iv ) tensor mesons dominate the observed structure .",
    "( v ) no signal is found for @xmath45 in any of the final states , leading to upper limits on the product branching fractions of the order of  @xmath46 .",
    "these processes are theoretically simple in that there are no hadronic final - state interactions . they have been studied extensively in radiative decay where good agreement with theory was found . studying these decays in the upsilon system tests models of scaling such as vdm , nrqcd , and mixing with @xmath48 . the previous upper limit ( from cleo ii ) on",
    "the branching fraction has stood at @xmath49 .",
    "cleo iii chooses the 3 main decay modes for the @xmath50 and 4 modes for the @xmath51 ( @xmath52 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "no signal is found in any of the channels in @xmath1 events , leading to upper limits ,  @xmath53  and  @xmath54 .",
    "this strongly disfavors mixing with @xmath48 .",
    "it is still consistent with vdm and , marginally , with nrqcd .",
    "these results are preliminary .",
    "the muonic branching fraction and the di - electron width of a quarkonium resonance are fundamental quantities in themselves . beyond that , frequently enters into derivation of other branching fractions while is important for comparisons with lqcd .",
    "cleo iii has re - measured and for the bound state upsilon resonances with high precision .      here , the main experimental challenges are precision luminosity measurement , subtraction of the copiously produced continuum muon pairs , and suppression of cosmic ray background .",
    "cleo iii reports@xcite the new measurements , @xmath55% , @xmath56% , and @xmath57% .",
    "this corresponds to a relative precision of @xmath58% in each case , far exceeding that any previous measurement .",
    "note also that while the value of for is consistent with previous measurements the results for and are significantly higher than the previous pdg values .",
    "this implies a downward shift in the values for the total widths of and .      the di - electron width , , of a bound upsilon state is proportional to the integral of the total cross section when scanning across the resonance in collisions .",
    "( the width can not be `` read off '' directly because it is only of the order of @xmath59 whereas the observed resonance shape is dominated by the beam energy spread of typically several @xmath60 . )",
    "the experimental challenge lies in tracking both the height of the resonance ( luminosity measurement , efficiency , backgrounds ) and its width ( shift in beam energy ) .",
    "effects contributing to the observed lineshape include continuum production of hadrons , two - photon fusion , cosmic - ray backgrounds , beam - gas background , and the radiative tails of lower mass resonances .",
    "cleo iii performed and analyzed repeated scans across each of , , and ( 11 , 6 , and 7 , respectively , see figure  [ gee_scans ] ) .",
    "the final results are@xcite , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63",
    ". the results are consistent with and significantly more precise than any previous measurements .",
    "this allows a stringent test of lqcd where the quantities most reliably calculable are the ratios of di - electron widths .",
    "figure  [ gee_lqcd ] shows one such comparison between experiment and extrapolated lqcd calculations@xcite .",
    "the agreement is good , and also presents a challenge to the lqcd community to further reduce the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "in this paragraph , @xmath65 denotes dipion cascade transitions between triplet @xmath66 states in bottomium , @xmath67 .",
    "measurements of these cascades date back to the very early days of the lena , argus , crystal ball , cusb , and cleo i experiments .",
    "quantities of interest are the branching fraction and , in particular , the distribution of the dipion invariant mass , .",
    "it has long been established that in the transition @xmath68 , peaks towards the upper end of the kinematic range just as in the corresponding transition in charmonium ( conforming to the yan model@xcite ) . by contrast , in @xmath69  exhibits double peak structure suggestive of final - state interactions , intermediate resonance formation , and/or coupled - channel effects as in the moxhay model@xcite ) .",
    "after nearly two decades of stagnation this subject has recently found renewed interest with experimental input from cleo iii as well as from babar and belle .",
    "cleo iii is in the process of finalizing a high - statistics study of the @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 cascades .",
    "babar just reported@xcite results on @xmath71 and @xmath72 cascades .",
    "belle also reported@xcite results on @xmath71 and , from their isr data sample results on @xmath69 and @xmath68 .",
    "the picture emerging from these results is intriguing , as shown in figure  [ all_mpipi ] .",
    "evidently ,  @xmath73  transitions exhibit double peak structure whereas @xmath74  transitions do not . at present there",
    "does not appear to be a theoretical explanation for such pattern .",
    "the study of properties and decays of bound upsilon states has recently gained renewed interest . on the experimental side ,",
    "results from cleo iii have been either first time observations or re - measurements which set new standards of precision .",
    "in addition , babar and belle have begun to exploit the wealth of bound state upsilon data produced as `` byproduct '' of running on the , and have already weighed in with exciting new results on dipion cascade transitions .",
    "furthermore , belle has done dedicated running at the and may do some more in the near future .",
    "the results provide key inputs to theory including quarkonium potential models , qcd and , in particular , to lqcd where calculations are approaching the few percent level in precision .",
    "i thank my colleagues in the cleo collaboration for their help with preparing this talk .",
    "i am also grateful to riccardo faccini of babar and tom browder of belle for valuable input from their respective experiments , and to george hou for an informative discussion on color - singlet @xmath75  color - octet models .",
