    "the combination of these two ingredients breaks explicitly the global spin - symmetry from @xmath22 down to @xmath0  namely , the number of states in each pair of states coupled by spin - orbit coupling is conserved _ modulo _ 2 , due to the presence of the spin - exchange interactions . indeed , while for @xmath23 the hamiltonian has a @xmath22 spin symmetry  @xcite , for generic values of @xmath24 , the spin symmetry is reduced to @xmath0 , whose correspondent conserved charge is the mutual parity between the two subsets @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ] connected by the spin exchange interaction @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "the robustness of this emergent parity symmetry stems from from angular momentum conservation : this symmetry may only be broken in the presence of terms such as , e.g. , @xmath29 , which generate a quantum of electronic angular momentum while preserving nuclear spin .",
    "the mechanism of establishing a @xmath0 symmetry is reminiscent of pair hopping of coupled wires  @xcite , although here it emerges naturally , and thus it is experimentally accessible in a physical setting .",
    "this symmetry is the building tool for the realization of a symmetry - protected quasi - topological phase whose spin sector has the same universal properties of kitaev s model  in particular , it hosts mqps as edge modes . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the emergence of such phase using a combination of analytical methods and density - matrix - renormalization - group  @xcite ( dmrg ) simulations ( see fig .  [",

    "two approaches can be carried out , one starting from @xmath30 and another starting from @xmath31 , leading to the same conclusions  @xcite : below , we focus on the former . following conventional bosonization  @xcite , we start by replacing each fermionic mode with a pair of right and left - movers , @xmath32 , which are given by : @xmath33 with @xmath34 for l / r , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 being conjugated bosonic operators describing density and phase fluctuations , respectively ( @xmath37 is the lattice spacing ) . for convenience ,",

    "the former are gapped by the spin - orbit coupling , so that they do not contribute significantly to the low - energy physics . instead",
    ", the dynamics of the latter fields is strongly affected by the interactions . after defining collective spin and charge degrees of freedom : @xmath50 one gets that , while the charge sector is still described by a luttinger hamiltonian ( away from commensurate fillings ) , the hamiltonian in the spin sector is : @xmath51 + \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\mathcal{w}\\int dx \\cos[\\sqrt{8\\pi}\\vartheta_{\\sigma } ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath52 .",

    "@xcite , consists of three steps .",
    "first , for each pair of states coupled by spin - orbit coupling , we restrict the dynamics to the lower band , following a procedure introduced in ref .",
    "then , coupling between the lowest bands is introduced via the spin - exchange interaction , and additional four - fermi couplings .",
    "this enlarged hamiltonian is characterized by two parameters @xmath84 : the point ( 0 , 0.9 ) represent the model studied in the previous section , while the points @xmath85 and @xmath86 represents two points in the phase diagram of the exactly solvable model  @xcite .",
    "we note that all symmetries of the problem are kept for arbitrary @xmath84 .    within this enlarged parameter space ,",
    "we have carried out dmrg simulations to show that the gap in the spin sector does not close .",
    "the latter was extracted from the decay of the green function in the bulk , @xmath87 , and is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : num2]a . along the full path in parameter space ,",
    "the gap stays open , implying that out quasi - topological state is the same phase as in ref .",
    "another striking signature of adiabatic continuity is the fact that all diagnostics applied before signal topological order all along the path .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : num2]b , where we plot the edge - edge green function at several points along the path itself .",
    "the model discussed above finds a natural implementation using fermionic isotopes of aea in optical lattices  @xcite , such as @xmath88yb , @xmath89yb , and @xmath90sr . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , the orbital degree of freedom is encoded in the electronic state : the @xmath4s@xmath5 ground state manifold representing @xmath91 , and the long - lived excited state manifold @xmath6p@xmath5 representing @xmath92 .",
    "the spin degree of freedom is instead encoded in the nuclear spin state , which for aea is basically decoupled from the electronic degree of freedom for both ground and low - lying excited states . in @xmath88yb ,",
    "the nuclear spin is @xmath93 , so all degrees of freedom are immediately available as required here . for @xmath89yb and @xmath90sr , which do have @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively ,",
    "unwanted zeeman states can be excluded from the dynamics either employing state - dependent light - shifts  @xcite , or by exploiting the fact that the clock frequency is @xmath96-dependent due to different linear zeeman shifts in the @xmath4s@xmath5 and @xmath6p@xmath5 manifold .",
    "the two key elements of our proposal , large spin - exchange interactions and spin - orbit couplings on the so - called clock transition , build upon state - of - the - art experimental progresses in aea physics . as demonstrated in recent experiments with @xmath89yb  @xcite",
    ", the spin - exchange interaction in these settings can be extremely large , of the order of @xmath97 khz in optical lattices , guaranteeing that the driven interaction strength in our system is considerably larger than typical temperatures .",
    "spin - orbit coupling between ground and excited states has been recently demonstrated both at jila  @xcite and at lens  @xcite , in both atomic clock and 3d optical lattice settings , realizing single - particle band structures akin to the one employed here , albeit with slightly different microscopic hamiltonians . in these experimental settings ,",
    "the quasi - topological phase can be characterized using both correlation function and spectral properties , as discussed above .",
    "the nature of the edge modes can be demonstrated using a variety of techniques  @xcite . in particular , time - of - flight imaging and edge spectroscopy can be used to demonstrate the existence of zero - energy modes and their inherent correlations .",
    "moreover , the fact that our model is adiabatically connected to an exactly - solvable point provides a qualitative guidance on the shape of the mqp wave - function - generically hard to analytically access in interacting systems - , opening up a concrete perspective to realize braiding operations in such settings .",
    "we have shown how majorana quasi - particles can emerge as edge modes of orbital hubbard models in the presence of spin - orbit interactions .",
    "the key element for the realization of the quasi - topological phase supporting them is angular momentum conservation , an epitome building block of atomic physics experiments .",
    "the stability of the mechanism we propose paves the way toward the investigation of interacting topological states and majorana edge modes in both atomic clocks and optical lattice experiments , where the main ingredients of our proposal are naturally realized and have been experimentally demonstrated over the last two years .",

    "we first replace the fermionic operators with right and left - movers : @xmath101 where @xmath37 is the lattice spacing , and then introduce the conventional bosonization representation : @xmath102 with @xmath34 for l / r , and @xmath103 being conjugated bosonic operators describing density and phase fluctuations , respectively , and @xmath104 are klein factors ( neglected in the following , they play a similar role as in ref .",

    "the low - energy physics is described by the conventional theory of spin - orbit coupled gases , given by @xmath105 + \\nonumber\\\\ & + & g_{so}\\int dx \\cos[\\sqrt{2\\pi}(\\vartheta_{f , a } + \\kappa\\varphi_{f , s } ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the luttinger parameters are all set to 1 , and @xmath45 denotes the first harmonic commensurate with spin orbit coupling , which is a function of @xmath46 .    after defining new fields , @xmath106 and @xmath107",
