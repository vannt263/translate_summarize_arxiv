    "although the topography of the gas disk of the milky way has previously been mapped ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and many others ) , its complete fourier structure has never been quantitatively described , though @xcite have approximated its three lowest frequency terms .",
    "which spatial oscillation frequencies are most important ? is the scalloping a local or global effect ?",
    "this paper constitutes an in depth analysis of the shape of the outer hi disk , as well as the first quantitative analysis of the scalloping .    the large - scale warp in the gas disk of the milky way has been known since 1957 @xcite .",
    "the warp has a large amplitude , rising to a height greater than 4 kpc at a galactocentric radius of 25 kpc in the northern data .",
    "it is also asymmetric ; in the south the gas falls about 1 kpc below the plane before rising back to it . by observing other galaxies ,",
    "it is possible to develop a general understanding of how warps behave .",
    "@xcite found that at minimum half of all galaxies are warped , and that galaxies with smaller dark matter halo core radii are less likely to be warped .",
    "@xcite claimed that a warp s line of nodes starts out straight , and at a transition begins to advance in the direction of rotation , with some exceptions .",
    "another survey has shown that warps are common in galaxies with hi disks that are extended compared to their optical components , and are often asymmetric @xcite . in the milky way",
    ", many components other than hi also participate in the warp .",
    "a partial list includes dust @xcite , co @xcite , solar neighborhood stars @xcite , and iras point sources @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been directed toward understanding the warp on a theoretical basis .",
    "bending modes have long been suspected as the mechanism creating and maintaining the warp .",
    "early work studying the evolution of bending mode oscillations was hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding galactic halos , but showed that the shape of the density falloff near the edge of the disk plays an important role in the stability of bending modes @xcite .",
    "the distribution of matter in the halo controls the ability of the disk to sustain long - lived bending wave warps , so studying the properties of the warp will tell us about the shape of the halo @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that bending mode oscillations are plausible when the halo and the self - gravity of the disk are taken into account , but @xcite showed that in this situation the warp will wind up within a few dynamical times .",
    "previous work has largely been concerned with the existence and behavior of @xmath3 warps only , though @xcite demonstrated the stability of @xmath4 modes in an axisymmetric halo .",
    "several other mechanisms have been suggested as possibilities for creating and maintaining a warp @xcite .",
    "gravitational interaction with satellites such as the magellanic clouds is a promising candidate @xcite , but there is a longstanding debate of whether tidal effects are strong enough to produce the observed effect @xcite . indeed , even in galaxies with companions similar to the lmc , tidal amplification may not be strong enough to account for the size of the warp @xcite .",
    "accretion of matter onto the halo is another plausible cause @xcite , or matter can accrete directly onto onto the disk and torque the gas orbits @xcite .",
    "intergalactic magnetic fields can act on a slightly ionized gas disk to produce a warp @xcite , or the intergalactic medium can excite a warp through a wind @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will refer to shorter wavelength ( 525 kpc ) oscillations in azimuth as scalloping .",
    "@xcite first noticed a `` waviness '' in the gas layer of the inner galaxy ; observational evidence for scalloping turns out to be prominent in the outer galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the possibility that the milky way scalloping results from the kelvin - helmholz instability , and @xcite suggested that the scalloping should only be present in the outer parts of galactic disks .",

    "we describe the method of transforming the heliocentric data cube into galactocentric coordinates , and present maps of the surface density , average height off the @xmath0 plane , and vertical thickness of the outer galaxy .",
    "while these maps are constructed using new data , they are not significantly different from previous work . in ",
    "3 we perform global and local analyses on these maps to better understand the warp and the scalloping .",
    "we use the 21 cm leiden / argentine / bonn ( lab ) data @xcite to conduct a quantitative study of the warp and scalloping .",
    "the lab survey is a combination of the lds data set @xcite with southern sky observations from the iar @xcite ; however , much attention has been paid toward ensuring a uniform data set .",
    "the data are corrected for stray radiation .",
    "the combined survey maps the entire sky within @xmath5 km s@xmath6 with a resolution of 1.3 km s@xmath6 ; this velocity range includes all of the gas in the galaxy in circular rotation .",
    "we used the hanning smoothed data , which have a velocity resolution of 1.9 km s@xmath6 , and used only data with @xmath7 .",
    "the signal of the warp in the north can be weakly traced beyond this elevation limit @xcite , but the vast majority of the warp signal is included within our @xmath8 range .",
    "the lab survey contains a large number of angularly small emission features , especially at high latitudes , which are not contiguous with the gas in the disk , and may not even be in circular rotation .",
    "features like these are particularly troublesome at larger galactic latitudes since they can contain enough gas to contaminate our calculations , especially at large galactocentric radii .",
    "these objects are removed with a median filter so we can focus on the gas in the disk .",
    "points with brightness temperature @xmath9 are temporarily filled with the value @xmath10 k for this filtering only .",
    "we then cycle through the lab data cube and calculate the median of each point and its 12 nearest neighbors in @xmath11 and @xmath8 at the same line - of - sight velocity @xmath12 ( a two dimensional diamond shaped filter ) ; call this median @xmath13 . any point with @xmath14",

    "@xmath32 is a parameterization of the ellipticity of the orbit , which is free to vary with galactocentric radius ; we discuss our method of calculating @xmath33 in the appendix . at all points ,",
    "these equations are simply the epicyclic approximation for an orbit with epicyclic frequency 1 and the angle of ellipse orientation fixed .",
    "although the gas orbits in the galaxy are not likely to correspond to the fixed ellipse orientation we describe , this configuration minimizes the correction to @xmath12 for gas far from @xmath35 or @xmath36 ( see @xcite for more detail on elliptical gas orbits ) . without a correction for radial motion of the gas",
    ", there is a large asymmetry between the surface densities at galactic longitudes on either side of @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "this must be taken into account , or features in these two regions such as the surface density will appear discontinuous and distorted . assuming an outward velocity for the local standard of rest ( lsr ) will correct this discontinuity to some degree @xcite .",
    "however , it seems that the best fit for the motion relative to the lsr changes with radius , implying that the effect is global , rather than local @xcite . to reduce the magnitude of the discontinuity using gas orbits , one can use a galactocentric radial velocity roughly of the form @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 ) @xcite .",
    "we exclude all points that lie within @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "points in these two wedges have velocities along the line of sight that are too small with respect to their random velocities to establish reliable distances .",

    "we do this by calculating the coordinates of an @xmath46 point in @xmath47 space , and interpolating from @xmath45 .",
    "the resolution of the galactocentric grid is set by the spacing of the lsr centered grid , but in this paper we are not interested in small - scale disk structure .",
    "a grid of 100 points in 10 kpc @xmath48 30 kpc , 350 points in @xmath49 , and 141 points in -20 kpc@xmath50 20 kpc gives us sufficient resolution to answer the questions we are interested in .",
    "undersampled grids fail to utilize all of the information in the data ; our choice of grid spacing is both is an undersampling and an oversampling of the information in @xmath45 depending on the position in the disk .",
    "consider two points near @xmath51 kpc and @xmath52 , where we have poor galactocentric resolution in @xmath19 .",
    "the lab survey has @xmath53 ; at this location this corresponds to @xmath54 .",
    "the spacing in our galactocentric grid is larger than @xmath55 , thus we are undersampled everywhere in the @xmath19 dimension . in  [ sec : lomb ] we will perform an azimuthal frequency analysis of each ring ; none of the frequencies we examine approach the nyquist frequency of the data . near the midplane at @xmath56 kpc and @xmath57 , lines of constant @xmath8",
    "are separated by around 300 pc , and near the top of the grid they are separated by around 400 pc ; there is some oversampling in the @xmath18 dimension by no more than a factor of 2 .",
    "the most severe case of oversampling is in the @xmath20 dimension , where along @xmath52 we have only 14 velocity resolution elements in our @xmath20 range for the 100 grid points . on the other hand , at @xmath58 ,",
    "there are more than 60 resolution elements in our range .",
    "we have chosen a grid spacing in @xmath20 that oversamples to a varying degree depending on location in the disk .    from @xmath44 , we can recover @xmath59 using the method outlined in @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath60 , the spin temperature , is 155 k everywhere .",
    "this is slightly higher than the maximum brightness temperature found in the lab survey in the region we are concerned with .",
    "choosing a larger number to force the optically thin limit ( @xmath61 ) makes a difference only in a small number of areas in the inner radii of our grid . the vast majority of the points are optically thin with any reasonable @xmath60 , and are not affected by this choice .",
    "the transformation to a density grid depends on @xmath62 .",
    "using elliptical orbits makes calculating this quantity slightly more difficult than with a flat rotation curve .",
    "although the full derivative can be written analytically , we just calculate it numerically .",
    "points with @xmath63 are set to @xmath64 .      the grid @xmath59 contains information about the density of hi in the galaxy , minus whatever has been removed by the median filter and the excluded regions .",
    "previous studies have proceeded by calculating a mean height @xmath65 for the gas .",
    "however , the galaxy is a complicated place that contains a variety of hi structures in addition to the disk . in particular",
    ", there are many extended clouds located near the disk as well as spurs that split off from the disk .",
    "none of these will have been removed by the median filter , which acts only on comparatively small areas of the sky .",
    "@xcite developed an alternative method to remove some of these features ; he masked out a map of high velocity cloud complexes .",
    "since we are only interested in the shape of the disk itself , these additional components must be filtered out before our calculation of the mean height .",
    "we perform a dispersion filter that operates as follows .    1 .",

    ", we experimented with several different cutoffs ( in the range @xmath74 ) ; our results do not depend strongly on which cutoff we choose .",
    "we construct the galactic disk surface density and mean height maps from @xmath73 .",
    "for example , we can sum the density over the @xmath18 dimension to construct the surface density associated with the disk ( figure [ fig : sigma ] ) : @xmath75 the indices @xmath76 and @xmath8 represent the top and bottom @xmath77 that have not been zeroed out by the dispersion filter .",
    "the resulting figure clearly demonstrates the falloff of the disk surface density with radius .",
    "the contour lines are nicely continuous across the @xmath35 and @xmath78 lines because of our use of elliptical orbits ; see the appendix for a version of this figure without correcting for these orbits .",
    "the jagged nature of the contours with @xmath79 kpc is due in part to spiral arms @xcite .",
    "there is a region near @xmath80 kpc and @xmath81 with a smaller surface density than other regions at the same radius ; this region has somewhat unusual features in all of our maps .",
    "also notice the excluded regions near the sun - galactic center line ; these gaps will appear in all of our plots .",
    "we will be looking closely at the mass weighted mean height of the gas disk ( figure [ fig : height ] ) , @xmath82 this height is calculated with respect to the galactic midplane defined by @xmath0 .",
    "the galactic warp is the most immediately evident feature in this map ; the gas in the northern hemisphere peaks at @xmath83 kpc , while the southern gas descends only to @xmath84 kpc , consistent with previous maps of the galaxy .",
    "at least three vertical oscillations of magnitude @xmath85 kpc can be seen in the south from @xmath86 to @xmath87 ; these have previously been called the `` scalloping '' .",
    "the approximate extent of the scalloping is marked with an arc connecting two `` s '' labels .",
    "the region of low surface density noted in the discussion of figure [ fig : sigma ] ( @xmath88 kpc , @xmath89 ) has a height that seems anomalous when compared to surrounding gas ( it is marked with an `` x '' ) .",
    "several features are elongated along lines of constant @xmath11 indicating some level of contamination by turbulent velocities and/or local gas . in the past",
    "these have been dubbed `` fingers of god '' because they all point back to the sun .            in  [ sec : warp ] we will need a measure of the uncertainty in the mean height of each point in the map .",
    "we define this error using the sum of squared residuals , as is usual for least squares fits : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the number of points in the calculation of the mean and surface density .",
    "this is only an approximation because it does not account for any of the uncertainty introduced in @xmath45 , @xmath33 , the interpolation to @xmath59 , or the dispersion filter .",
    "typically , @xmath92 .    because of effects like turbulence , anomalous velocities , and spiral arms , the features in the mean height map may not correspond to the actual shape of the galaxy .",
    "the severity of this effect can be seen by looking at a contour map of @xmath93 ( see figure [ fig : uncert ] ) .",
    "while similar to previously published plots @xcite , this figure also includes the correction for elliptical gas orbits . given a turbulent velocity of magnitude @xmath94 , features with coherent scales less than @xmath95 could potentially be false signals .",
    "furthermore , even real features will be blurred out or even incorrectly positioned over the same length scale .",
    "a typical turbulent velocity is around 8 km s@xmath6 .",
    "small regions can differ from the flat rotation curve by 20 - 30 km s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we do not expect that these distortions will significantly effect our fourier analysis .",
    "the steep contours near @xmath35 and @xmath78 demonstrate the need for the excluded regions , because small irregularities in velocity there result in large changes in distance .     a contour map of @xmath93 , including the velocity contribution from the elliptical gas orbit correction .",
    "the axes are marked in kpc ; the contours delineate regions of 250 pc/(km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the contours rise close to the galactic center and anticenter due to the small radial velocities of gas in those regions , demonstrating why the data in those directions are excluded from the rest of the study . ]",
    "we also construct a measure of the thickness of the disk .",
    "in contrast to the previous section , we keep all of the complicated features of the hi in our calculation of the thickness .",
    "we do this because these features do contain information regarding pressure and gravitational force , although they are a nuisance when calculating the mean height .",
    "in particular , our method for finding the thickness of the disk relies heavily on the tails of the vertical density distribution .",
    "thus , in this section , we will work with @xmath96 instead of @xmath97 .",
    "following @xcite , we define the first and third quartile points as @xmath98 and @xmath99 as the smallest and largest indices , respectively , that satisfy : @xmath100 we then define the half thickness ( a factor of 2 smaller than @xcite to ease comparison with recent work ) : @xmath101 note that this implies that @xmath102 is quantized by @xmath103 ( about 140 pc ) .",
    "this can lead to inaccuracies in @xmath102 in places where the thickness is small , i.e. @xmath104 kpc .",
    "@xmath105 is shown in figure [ fig : disp ] .",
    "some points near the sun actually have calculated half - thicknesses of zero ; this is due to the comparatively small thickness of the disk in that region combined with our limited lab survey range @xmath7 and poor grid resolution in @xmath18 .",
    "the flaring of the disk with radius is immediately evident , as @xmath102 increases in magnitude by a factor of about 8 between @xmath104 and 30 kpc ; this flaring was first seen in @xcite .",
    "asymmetry between the northern and southern halves of the disk is also prominent ; the southern half of the galaxy has a lower average thickness than the northern .",
    "this asymmetry was also evident in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the low surface density region around @xmath106 kpc has a very large thickness ; the gas in the region has clearly been disturbed and dispersed by some mechanism .",
    "there are regions of increased thickness close to @xmath107 and @xmath108 near @xmath109 kpc probably caused by local gas .",
    "figure [ fig : rfuncs ] plots the surface density and half - thickness of the hi layer averaged over @xmath19 as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "this figure confirms our visual impressions from the surface density and dispersion maps by showing the falloff in the surface density and the flaring of the thickness with radius .",
    "the contamination by local gas described in the previous paragraph as well as the poor @xmath18 resolution problem mentioned at the beginning of the section account for the rise in the average of @xmath102 with decreasing @xmath20 near @xmath109 kpc ; there is no evidence the thickness of the disk actually behaves this way . a gradient - expansion least - squares routine @xcite gives the best fit for the surface density beyond 14 kpc ( where the exponential falloff begins ) as : @xmath110 ~\\mathrm{m}_\\odot~ \\mathrm{pc}^{-2}.\\ ] ]",
    "using the maps we have constructed , we conduct a quantitative investigation of the disk vertical structure . since we are studying a disk , we use a method that is independent of rotation in @xmath19 and treats @xmath111 and @xmath112 as the same point .",
    "furthermore , the data are unevenly sampled due to the excluded regions within @xmath113 of the sun - galactic center line .",
    "we complete the analysis without extrapolating @xmath114 in these regions , to avoid introducing any artifacts into the signal . throughout this paper",
    ", we refer to different frequency oscillations in the disk .",
    "these frequencies will always be labeled by the number of oscillations they will complete in a full @xmath115 ; thus the @xmath3 mode has a one maximum and one minimum in the disk .",
    "the galactic warp is the most prominent feature in figure [ fig : height ] .",
    "a lomb periodogram analysis of each radius ring ( see  [ sec : lomb ] ) reveals that the power in each of the @xmath116 and 2 modes is consistently larger than that in any other mode for @xmath117 kpc . at some radii @xmath118",

    "we use a monte carlo algorithm to determine the noise level for the lomb periodogram . for each ring ,",
    "the null hypothesis is gaussian white noise with the same dispersion as the data in @xmath150 .",
    "we construct @xmath151 sets of noise for each ring , run the lomb periodogram on each set , and record the highest peak in the lomb amplitude .",
    "we then determine the distribution of peaks in these amplitudes , and define the 95% confidence interval as the amplitude just larger than 95% of the noise amplitude peaks .",
    "we use the same technique to determine the 99% confidence level . to conclude that a signal is real and not caused by noise , the signal strength must cross these confidence levels .",
    "we found nearly identical noise levels by scrambling the order of the data instead of using gaussian white noise , indicating that these calculations are robust .",
    "the lomb periodogram of @xmath149 for the @xmath127 kpc ring is shown in figure [ fig : lombring28 ] .",
    "95% and 99% confidence levels are marked as thresholds in amplitude .",
    "at this radius , there is significant strength in modes 4 - 6 , 10 , and 15 .",
    "these modes are markedly weaker than the warp components at the same radii , which have amplitudes of 1 - 2 kpc .    in the case of",
    "unevenly spaced or missing data points , simple sine waves are not eigenmodes of the system . one way to see this is to take a lomb periodogram of a pure sine wave on our @xmath19 grid with missing data ; a small amount of the power will leak into other frequencies . thus subtracting out the warp from @xmath114 influences the amplitudes of the higher order modes from the lomb periodogram because individual @xmath148 modes are not independent .",
    "we argue that the subtraction is nonetheless acceptable because the warp and the scalloping appear to be due to physically distinct phenomena ; studying them is much easier once they have been separated .",
    "removing the strongest modes will also result in a more accurate power spectrum of the weaker frequencies , since we eliminate the power leakage from the stronger to the weaker modes .",
    "figure [ fig : lombfreqs ] shows how the amplitudes in several different @xmath148 modes evolve with @xmath20 .",
    "modes 4 - 6 , 10 , and 15 appear to increase in strength at outer radii , while mode 3 is strongest in the intermediate radii in our map . other modes",
    "have no detectable strength because they do not cross the 95% confidence level at any radii . also notice how the confidence thresholds rise with radius because of the increase in the dispersion of @xmath149 .",
    "another consequence of using the lomb periodogram analysis on unevenly spaced data is that it is possible to be fooled by a false signal due to ringing from interference between different @xmath148 modes .",
    "it is difficult to protect against this , but if two strong modes were interfering with each other to produce a third signal , we would expect at least two of the signals to increase in strength at the same radius .",
    "the strongest modes in figure [ fig : lombfreqs ] become significant at different radii and have visually different evolution with radius ; we conclude that these modes are real .",

    "the 95% and 99% significance levels are drawn as dotted and dashed lines , respectively . ]",
    "the lomb periodogram can not be used to study the local structure of the disk since it can not determine where in azimuth each mode is strong .",
    "imagine a situation where , like a falling stone creating ripples on the surface of a pond , something passes through the hi disk and excites a local series of vertical oscillations .",
    "the oscillation will add power to some frequencies in the lomb periodogram , but this effect may be dwarfed by oscillations elsewhere in the disk .",
    "we wish to detect these sorts of perturbations and learn where in the disk they are prominent .",
    "one way to draw out this type of structure is to use a wavelet analysis .",
    "wavelets are ideal for our purposes because they are localized in both position and frequency space ; in other words , they will show where in the disk a given mode of oscillation is dominant .",
    "in wavelet theory , it is beneficial to choose a mother wavelet that is similar in shape to the signals you are searching for .",
    "since we are looking for sinusoidal perturbations , we use the normalized morlet wavelet with @xmath152 ; this is simply a sine wave times a gaussian envelope . in the same way that a fourier transform breaks down the frequency structure of a signal using sines and cosines ,",
    "a wavelet transform breaks down a signal in terms of a set of these morlet wavelets centered at different spatial positions and with a range of frequencies .",
    "however , in a continuous wavelet transform like the one we perform , the different wavelet functions are not orthogonal .    to avoid having to interpolate or zero out the excluded regions ,",
    "we will examine the northern and southern halves of the galaxy separately .",
    "as in  [ sec : lomb ] , we will work with the mean height function once the warp has been subtracted , @xmath149 .",
    "points in frequency and position space that would involve the excluded regions are defined as being inside the `` cone of influence '' ; points in this region are subject to edge effects , and are therefore discarded .",
    "the points affected by this are not just those in the excluded regions but also those adjacent to these regions , within some range set by the wavelength ( and thus the frequency ) of the particular mode @xcite .",
    "thus , lower frequency modes will have a larger portion of the disk fall inside the cone of influence , and have to discard a larger range of points .",
    "it is also important to have some analytic measure of which peaks in the filtered power spectrum are significant .",
    "significance levels are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we construct a combination of parameters that have a @xmath153 distribution , and count as significant those that cross the 95% confidence level threshold .",
    "again , we use gaussian white noise to model the randomness in the height function .",
    "the wavelet power spectrum , @xmath154 , for the northern half of the @xmath127 kpc ring is plotted in figure [ fig : specring ] ; the southern half is shown in figure [ fig : specring2 ] .",
    "the mathematical details of the wavelet transform are summarized in the appendix .",
    "this ring has several regions with significant power .",
    "these regions have a large width in both dimensions because wavelets do not have precise resolution in either position or frequency space . much like the uncertainty principle , the cost of using a technique that gives both position and frequency information is mediocre resolution in both .",
    "the power around @xmath81 comes from the sharp dip at that azimuth ; as the figure shows , this causes ringing for a large range of frequencies .",
    "the power at @xmath155 is due to the `` scalloping '' in that region .",
    "the filtered wavelet power spectra for several different bands are plotted in figure [ fig : waveplot ] .",
    "the band that is labeled @xmath156 is actually the filtered sum of the power spectra that satisfy @xmath157 , and so on .",
    "note that since we calculate the power spectra for the northern and southern halves independently , the significance contours are different for the two hemispheres , in addition to being a function of @xmath20 . in practice , this occurs because the variance of @xmath158 for the northern half of the galaxy is larger than that for the southern , and the strength required of the power spectrum to cross the 95% confidence level is directly proportional to the variance .",
    "we grouped the @xmath159 and 2 modes together in the warp because of their similar magnitudes in a lomb periodogram .",
    "a close look at their dependence with @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : warpamp ] ) demonstrates that there are additional similarities . both the 0 and the 2 mode are near zero until about 15 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "the 0 mode grows linearly from this point outwards while the 2 mode declines a small amount , and then grows approximately linearly by about 1.2 kpc . in comparison ,",
    "the @xmath3 mode starts out fairly large ( @xmath160 pc ) , declines slightly and then grows by about an order of magnitude .",
    "though the @xmath1 mode does break off from this pattern at larger radii , all three components grow essentially monotonically , approximately linearly , and with similar slopes over the range @xmath161 kpc .",
    "this may be a clue that their origins involve the same physics , and helps to justify our classification of higher frequency modes as scalloping .",
    "studying the radial dependence of the warp inside the solar circle seems a fruitful way to learn more about these three components .    the filtered wavelet power spectrum maps ( fig .  [ fig : waveplot ] )",
    "are a representation of the scalloping in the outer galaxy . due to frequency - position uncertainty relations , it is impossible to establish precisely the oscillation frequency of any local disturbance .",
    "this uncertainty manifests itself in the wavelet transform by perturbations that are only somewhat localized in frequency and position space , and therefore have some width in both .    these maps",
    "demonstrate that the @xmath162 scalloping found near @xmath163 and @xmath164 kpc mentioned in previous work @xcite is real .",
    "the strong power around @xmath165 in the wavelet transform is accompanied by a large amplitude in the lomb periodogram for @xmath165 at the corresponding radii .",
    "wavelet transforms are also subject to the same problems that bedevil traditional fourier transform approaches .",
    "for example , there is a large amount of power around @xmath166 kpc and @xmath81 in @xmath167 .",
    "this power is most likely not a result of scalloping in all of these different frequencies over some range of @xmath19 ; instead , it is probably due to ringing . as in a fourier decomposition ,",
    "sharp changes in height will cause ringing in all frequencies of a wavelet transform .",
    "indeed , the height map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : height ] ) does have an abrupt drop near @xmath81 which could cause this ringing ; we mark this region with an ` x ' . the same feature can be seen after the warp has been subtracted in the ring at 28 kpc plotted in figure [ fig : specring ] .",
    "we use the local and global analyses in conjunction to determine whether there is any scalloping mode that is present over a full @xmath115 ring in the outer galaxy .",
    "this is important because it will determine whether the mechanism that causes scalloping operates on a global or local scale . for this task ,",
    "both techniques are necessary because even a pure @xmath165 oscillation will have some width in frequency space when put through a wavelet transform .",
    "however , this same oscillation will have a sharp peak in the lomb periodogram .",
    "therefore , in order to state that some mode exists over a full @xmath115 , we require both significant strength in the lomb periodogram and significant power over a large range of @xmath19 in the wavelet transform . this combination will conclusively determine whether the scalloping is a global or local phenomenon .    for modes with @xmath168",
    "this technique is not useful .",
    "these modes are clearly important because their lomb periodograms show significant power for @xmath169 .",
    "unfortunately , these modes have large enough wavelengths that the excluded regions always interfere with the wavelet transform regardless of where in the disk we look .",
    "a method of reducing the size of the excluded regions would alleviate this problem .",
    "however , this is likely to be difficult because eliminating the excluded regions would require a detailed knowledge of both @xmath31 and the distribution of gas velocities due to turbulence in the disk .",
    "portions of these region are optically thick , which will make density determination impossible .    with these constraints ,",
    "the lomb periodogram leads us to conclude that the modes @xmath165 and 15 are the most fruitful places to look for scalloping that travels a full circle around the disk .",
    "other modes do have interesting features , but their smaller lomb amplitudes imply that we could be fooled by the imperfect frequency resolution of the wavelet power spectrum .",
    "for example , the modes @xmath170 have significant wavelet power for large portions of the northern half of the galaxy , but none of these modes has significant signal for the corresponding radius range in the lomb periodogram .    for the @xmath165 mode the only large region with significant power in the south is the one around @xmath171 that we noted previously .",
    "the power in this perturbation has fallen below the 95% confidence level by @xmath172 , implying that this scalloping is a local effect .",
    "the same appears to be true for the @xmath173 oscillations , although this mode does have a region of high significance near @xmath166 kpc over a large range of @xmath19 . however , the northern part of this signal is the region where we believe ringing to play an important role .",
    "it is therefore possible that the @xmath173 mode does have significant wavelet power over the full @xmath115 near @xmath174 kpc , but the evidence is not conclusive because the northern part of the wavelet power is most likely not due to scalloping",
    ".    with the exception of the @xmath173 mode , no frequency we examine with the wavelet transform carries significant power around an entire ring along with a correspondingly significant lomb periodogram strength . for this reason ,",
    "we conclude that scalloping generally appears to be a local phenomenon . the modes @xmath175 remain a possible exception , since we were not able to study them with a wavelet transform .",
    "it remains unclear what mechanism acts as the energy source for the scalloping .",
    "one possible cause is a massive object passing through the disk that excites local vertical oscillations in the hi gas .",
    "azimuthally traveling wavefronts can be created by the magnetic field threaded through the disk ; if the field is primarily azimuthal in nature , vertical oscillations will have larger phase and group velocities in the azimuthal direction than in the radial direction .",
    "this could lead to scalloping such as that seen towards @xmath163 .",
    "we fit the global shape of the warp on our grid of concentric rings using a vertical offset and two sinusoidal modes . outside of @xmath176 kpc ,",
    "each of these three modes has more power than any of the higher frequencies we look at",
    ". the amplitude increases with radius over our entire radius range for the 1 mode , and starting from around 15 kpc for the 0 and 2 modes .",
    "the growth of the 0 and 2 modes results in asymmetry in the warp ; this growth begins near where the stellar disk ends .",
    "the line of maxima of the @xmath3 mode is essentially coincident with one of the lines of maxima of the @xmath1 mode .",
    "there is little evidence for precession or winding of these two modes .",
    "a global analysis with the lomb periodogram shows that each @xmath148 mode evolves differently with radius .",
    "the most interesting include @xmath177 , and 15 , each of which start at small radii below the 95% significance level and then cross it further out in the disk .",
    "an analysis combining the global lomb periodogram and the local wavelet transform shows that none of the modes with @xmath178 have strength over a full ring of the disk . using a wavelet transform ,",
    "we show that the scalloping observed by previous authors near @xmath179 is real .",
    "we therefore conclude that the scalloping is a local effect .",
    "lower frequency modes proved impossible to study with wavelets due to the presence of the excluded regions .",
