    "the world wide web is a distributed document and media repository @xcite .",
    "hyper - text markup language ( html ) documents reference other html documents and media ( e.g.  images , audio , etc . ) by means of an href citation .",
    "the resulting document citation graph has been the object of scholastic research @xcite as well as a component utilized in web page ranking @xcite .",
    "similarly , the semantic web is a distributed resource identifier repository @xcite .",
    "the resource description framework ( rdf ) serves as one of the primary standards of the semantic web @xcite .",
    "rdf provides the means by which uniform resource identifiers ( uri ) @xcite are interrelated to form a multi - relational or edge labeled graph . if @xmath1 is the set of all uris , @xmath2 is the set of all literals , and @xmath3 is the set of all blank ( or anonymous ) nodes , the the semantic web rdf graph is defined as the set of triples @xmath4 given that the uri is the foundational standard of both the world wide web and the semantic web , the semantic web serves as an extension to the world wide web in that it provides a semantically - rich graph overlay for uris .",
    "thus , the semantic web moves the web beyond the simplistic href citation into a rich relational structure that can be utilized for numerous end user applications .",

    "this shift is both technologically and culturally different from the relational database paradigm .",
    "for one , the address space of the web of data is the uri address space , which is inherently distributed and infinite .",
