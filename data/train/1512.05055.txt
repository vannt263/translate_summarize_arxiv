    "inference of gene regulatory networks ( grns ) is important to understand every detail and principle of biological system , and one of the most popular methods is to reconstruct grns by time - course data . in the past decades , the boolean networks @xcite , the bayesian networks @xcite , and the ordinary differential equation ( ode ) networks @xcite , etc .",
    ", have been proposed to reconstruct grns , and meanwhile , the corresponding algorithms were also proposed to infer the network topologies and parameter values .    in this paper , we are devoted to infer the s - system model of grn is , a popular nonlinear ode model that represents the dynamic process of biochemical system .",
    "it is a nonlinear ode system @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the expression level of gene @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the total number of genes in the investigated network .",
    "there are totally @xmath4 parameters to be specified in an s - system , where @xmath5 are positive rate constants , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are kinetic constants .    generally speaking",
    ", it is an inverse problem to infer the s - system using the time course data on expression levels of genes .",
    "a general way is to minimize the normalized errors between experimental time course data and numerical results @xcite , that is , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the numerical results of @xmath1 at time @xmath10 , and @xmath11 refers to the experimental value of gene expression level .",
    "however , the inverse problem is usually ill - posed , and an @xmath12 regularizer could be introduced to penalize the data error @xcite . in this way , the minimization model is improved as @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the @xmath12 norm of parameter vector @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the penalization parameter .",
    "however , it is a challenging task to preset an appropriate value of @xmath16 for grns with unknown properties because it is often problem - dependent .",
    "one of the ways to eliminate the difficulty of set appropriate values of @xmath16 is to convert the single - objective optimization models to bi - objective models .",
    "liu and wang @xcite proposed a three - objective optimization model simultaneously minimizing the concentration error , slope error and interaction error to find a suitable s - system model structure and its corresponding parameter values , however , they transformed it to a single - objective optimization problem solved by a hybrid differential evolution algorithm , that is , a prior preference was introduced to the inference process . spieth _ _",
    "@xcite took the data error and connectivity number as two minimization objective , but the s - system was integrally inferred because no decoupling method was employed .",
    "as a consequence , the obtained pareto front contained numerous pareto vectors , and it was challenging to choose the appropriate pareto solution(s ) as the potential s - system setting(s ) .",
    "_ @xcite and cai _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite simultaneously minimized data error for several different data sets , but , did not optimize a metric to make the obtained network sparse .    when grns are reconstructed via evolutionary computation methods ,",
    "another problem arises with the heavy evaluation process of candidate parameter settings . to evaluate a set of parameters generated by recombination strategies",
    ", the ode system must be solved via some numerical method , for example , the runge - kutta method .",
    "however , all equations of a coupled ode system must be simultaneously solved , and thus , the evaluation process is computationally heavy . to reduce the complexity of individual evaluation ,",
    "tsai and wang@xcite used a linear lagrange polynomial to decouple the ode system , however , another parameter that has to be regulated was introduced .",
    "liu _ _ et al.__@xcite developed a separable parameter estimation method ( spem ) to decouple the s - system . by these means , each ode can be respectively identified by optimization methods .    in order to eliminate the pruning process for setting appropriate parameter values , in this paper we present a multi - objective optimization model for inference of grns , and decoupling the s - system by the spem .",
    "then , a multi - objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to obtain the network topology and parameter values .",
    "although spem includes computation process of inverse matrices , our algorithms can perform well for benchmark problems , because only small population is needed to obtain satisfactory results .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] introduces spem and bi - objective optimization model for grn inference , and a proposed multi - objective evolutionary algorithm is introduced in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "then , section [ sec4 ] performs a preliminary comparison between the obtained pareto sets with results reported in references .",
    "ultimate inference results obtained by akaike information criterion ( aic ) are characterized in section [ sec5 ] , and finally , section [ sec6 ] draws the conclusions and presents the future work .",
    "trying to fit the curves of derivatives instead of the function curves , the spem minimize the difference between @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a candidate parameter vector of the s - system , and @xmath17 is approximated by the five - point numerical derivative method .",
    "then , spem constructs the following minimization problem @xmath20,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the approximate value of @xmath24 at time @xmath25 .",
    "denoting @xmath26 , @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 we can rewrite ( [ spem1 ] ) as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the @xmath31-norm .",
    "note that @xmath32 does not depend on @xmath33 , @xmath33 can be estimated as @xmath34 substitute ( [ spem3 ] ) into ( [ spem2 ] ) , we can infer each equation of s - system by @xmath35s_i .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ i=1,\\dots , n\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after the kinetic constants are obtained , corresponding rate constants can be figure out by ( [ spem3 ] ) .",
    "then , the coupled s - system is decoupled , and parameters can be estimated equation by equation .      to infer parameters values equation by equation , we propose a multi - objective optimization ( mo ) model @xmath36 the first objective minimizes the error for estimation of derivatives , and the second objective is employed to obtain a sparse network , where @xmath30 refers to the @xmath37-norm of parameter vectors , i.e. , number of connections in the network .",
    "then , we propose a multi - objective evolutionary algorithm to obtain the parameter values .",
    "because we employ the spem decoupling the s - system , we can infer ode equations one by one . in the proposed multi - objective evolutionary algorithm ( moea ) , each equation is represented by a combination of bit - string and real variables @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are respectively bit - strings and real vector of length @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath42 , it means that in the model the parameter @xmath43 is not zero ; if @xmath44 , it means that in the model the parameter @xmath45 is not zero . representing a model via @xmath46",
    "can definitely express the model topology by bit - strings , and consequently , no threshold is needed to round a small parameter value to zero .",
    "the moea to solve the multi - objective optimization model ( [ mo ] ) is described as follows .",
    "step1 : : :    randomly generate two populations @xmath47 $ ] and    @xmath48 $ ] of @xmath49 individuals .    here",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 are the binary    populations , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the    real populations .",
    "evaluate @xmath47 $ ] and    @xmath48 $ ] via ( [ mo ] ) . set    @xmath54=[oldpop , oldrpop]$ ] and    @xmath55 ; initialize    @xmath56 to be a    randomly selected individual in @xmath47 $ ] ; step2 : : :    generate @xmath57 offsprings to construct the    intermediate population @xmath58 $ ] and evaluate it .",
    "step3 : : :    set @xmath48=[pop , rpop]$ ] .",
    "perform non - dominated    sorting on the combination of @xmath47 $ ] and    @xmath58 $ ] . then , sort it via the dominance rank and    values of the second objective in ascending order ; step4 : : :    select @xmath49 best individuals to update the population    @xmath47 $ ] ; update    @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath59    via @xmath47 $ ] ; randomly select a non - dominated    individual as @xmath60 ; step 5 : : :    if the stopping criterion is not satisfied , goto step2 ; otherwise ,    output the non - dominated solutions and the iteration process ceases .    because the spem is employed decoupling the s - system , there are only @xmath41 parameters to identify each ode equation .",
    "note that the second minimization objective as the total number of connections .",
    "there are at most @xmath61 non - domimnated solutions in the pareto set .",
    "then , we set the population size greater than @xmath61 , and no diversity mechanisms is needed to obtain a diverse pareto front . however , if we take the norm of parameter vectors as the second objective that can be any non - negative real value , to obtain a diverse pareto front a diverse - keeping strategy is necessary . as a consequence , the time complexity increases .",
    "meanwhile , the obtained pareto set could contain several pareto solutions with same network topology and similar parameter values , which does not deserve the increased time complexity to some extent .    due to the several discrete values of the second objective",
    ", the population could be absorbed by some network topology ( confirmed by the bit - string @xmath62 ) that is easy to locate .",
    "thus , we employ a pool of real vectors that keep the diversity of obtained solutions at the early stage of evolution and focus on local exploitation at the late stage .      to generate candidate solutions ,",
    "three parents are randomly selected .",
    "according to the method proposed in @xcite , three parents are selected as follows .    * with a probability @xmath63 , two different parents @xmath64 and @xmath65 are selected from the present population @xmath66 $ ] , and @xmath67 is selected from the last population @xmath68 $ ] ; * otherwise , three different parents @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath69 are randomly selected from the archive @xmath54 $ ] ;    then , compare @xmath70 with @xmath71 , and initialize the offspring @xmath72 as the winner .      to generate the binary offspring @xmath73",
    ", we employ @xmath56 guiding the search .",
    "@xmath74 ,    * if @xmath75 and @xmath76 hold , @xmath77 is set to be @xmath78 with probability @xmath79 ; * if @xmath75 and @xmath80 hold , @xmath77 is randomly generated with probability @xmath81 ; * otherwise , @xmath77 is randomly generated with probability @xmath81 .      the real offspring @xmath82 is generated as follows .",
    "* with probability @xmath83 , @xmath84 * otherwise , @xmath85    here @xmath86 and @xmath87 are two real vector randomly selected from the real vector set @xmath59 ;      at the beginning , the archive is randomly initialized . during the evolving process",
    ", @xmath88 , the worst archive member whose second objective value is greatest will be replaced once an offspring @xmath89 is generated dominating @xmath88 .",
    "to enhance the global exploration and local exploitation abilities , we employ a real pool @xmath59 with its corresponding objective vector set @xmath90 in the proposed moea .",
    "@xmath59 is initialized as the real population @xmath52 at the beginning , and during the evolving process , a randomly selected real vector @xmath91 is updated by @xmath92 if it dominates @xmath93 via the corresponding objective vectors .",
    "to evaluate the performance of our proposed method , we utilize it inferring four benchmark s - systems . for each benchmark s - system , we employ a population of size 20 to solve the proposed multi - objective optimization model ( [ mo ] ) .",
    "after 4000 iterations , the obtained non - dominated solutions and their objective values are saved .",
    "the parameter settings listed in tab .",
    "[ tab5 ] are controlled via a process indicator @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the generation counter , @xmath96 is the maximum generation for the stopping criterion .",
    "we perform 20 independent runs for each ode equation of four benchmark systems , and the best obtained results with smallest data errors are respectively included in tabs .",
    "[ tab1 ] , [ tab2 ] , [ tab3 ] and [ tab4 ] .",
    "both precise network parameters and obtained results are listed in the tables , where the inference results are enclosed by parentheses . for convenience of comparison ,",
    "the first number in the parentheses is results obtained by our method , and the second is what was reported in references . if the inference result for a run can not correctly identify all connections , we take it as a failure run of the proposed moea .",
    "then , the success rates are also included in the last columns of the tables .    .parameter settings in the proposed moea . [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is shown that the sensitivity @xmath97 is equal to 1 except for the fourth equation ( @xmath98 ) , which means that for all equations the true network connections can be identified with a probability approximately equal to 1 ; however , sometimes the specificity @xmath97 is less than 1 , which occurs when the true network topologies plus false positive connections can achieve better fitting errors .",
    "in this paper , we presents an evolutionary multi - objective approach to inference network of s - system , using the spem decoupling the ode system .",
    "then , aic is employed to select one pareto solution as the final inference result . due to the proposed multi - objective optimization model",
    ", there is no need to preset any parameter value before the inference moea is run .",
    "so , our method could be generally applicable to various kind of grn model .",
    "however , we also find that this method is sensitive to the curve of expression level , and multiple data sets are needed to improve its performances .",
    "future work will be focused on inference of grn based on noisy data , and how to generalize the proposed method to infer big - scale grns .",
