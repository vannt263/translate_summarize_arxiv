    "supersoft sources constitute an interesting new class of x - ray binary sources ( cf .",
    "van den heuvel et al . 1992 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that their spectra are extremely soft ( effective temperatures of a few @xmath8 ) and their luminosities are substantial ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "they thus can not only be studied in the milky way and the near - by magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) but also in more distant galaxies ( the andromeda galaxy m31 and the spiral galaxy ngc  55 ) . for a review see hasinger ( 1994 ) , kahabka & trmper ( 1996 ) and kahabka & van den heuvel ( 1997 ) , see also greiner ( 1996 ) .",
    "they are considered to be at least one class of progenitors of type ia supernovae ( cf .",

    "a distance of 700  kpc is adopted ( slightly different distances of 690 and 725  kpc are used in other literature ) .",
    "the inclination of the galaxy is 77.5@xmath10 .",
    "the inner `` apparent bulge '' has a radius of 3  kpc and the bulge is truncated at a radius of 6.4  kpc .",
    "the disk extends to a radius of @xmath420  kpc ( hatano et al .",
    "first a number of candidate supersoft sources in m31 is derived from the 1991 x - ray point source catalog ( retrieved from cds via anonymous ftp 130.79.128.5 ) making use of the hardness ratios ( `` x - ray colors '' ) hr1 , hr2 and the count rate information .",
    "for the 26 candidates a hydrogen column ( @xmath3 ) distribution and a white dwarf mass distribution is derived assuming non - lte white dwarf atmosphere spectra .",
    "the observationally derived white dwarf mass distribution is compared with the mass distribution predicted from population synthesis calculations and the number of the population is corrected accordingly .",
    "the observationally derived @xmath3 distribution is compared with a galaxy scale height @xmath3 distribution and the population is corrected accordingly .",

    "the selection criterion for a supersoft source is :    @xmath15    a 16-th supersoft source , a recurrent transient has been discovered by white et al .",
    "we call this sub - sample of 16 sources the supper - white ( sw ) sample",
    ".    it has been shown by kahabka ( 1998 ) that the individual spectral parameters giving information on the white dwarf masses of these 16 m31 supersoft sources can be constrained if the hardness ratios hr1 and hr2 and the count rate as given in the catalog of supper et al .",

    "the hardness ratios hr1 and hr2 and the count rates have been compared with theoretical values derived using non - lte white dwarf atmosphere spectra . as a result we found that for all these 16 sources the white dwarf masses were quite large @xmath17 .    in the present work non - lte models of white dwarf atmospheres",

    "it should be noted that although the standard deviations for some sources are very large ( which might suggest that these sources are not detected significantly ) all these sources have been detected significantly in the soft ( 0.1 - 0.4  kev ) band ( see table  5 of supper et al .",
    "the high standard deviations in the 0.1 - 2.4  kev band are due to the fact that in this band most of the counts are background ones from the 0.4 - 2.4  kev range .",
    "white dwarf masses are determined under the assumption that the source is on the stability line of surface hydrogen burning ( cf .",

    "sources lying deep inside the galaxy disk or even located below the galaxy disk are expected to be at least in part even more strongly absorbed and are not covered by the selection criterion used for the sw sample .",

    "deriving a mass distribution of a galaxy population is by far not trivial . in case of white dwarfs in supersoft sources",
    "it appears to be possible to derive reliable estimates of the masses using certain assumptions which have to be shown in later work to be correct or at least not completely unreasonable ( cf .",

    "supersoft sources could then contribute up to a rate of @xmath113 .",
    "capellaro ( 1997 ) assuming our galaxy to be a spiral of type sb or sc , detected a type ia supernova rate of @xmath114 which for m31 , with is about two times larger mass , means : @xmath115 .",
    "it thus seems that the supersoft x - ray sources can make a major contribution to the type ia sn rate in m31 .",

    "from the 1991 m31 x - ray point source catalog a sample of 26 candidate supersoft sources has been derived using one of the selection criteria @xmath116 or @xmath117 , @xmath118 and assuming that the observed count rate is in agreement with the expected steady - state luminosity . for these candidates absorbing hydrogen column densities , effective temperatures and white dwarf masses ( assuming the sources are on the stability line of atmospheric nuclear burning )",

    "the observed white dwarf mass distribution of supersoft sources in m31 appears to be constrained to masses @xmath119 .",
    "the whole population of supersoft sources in m31 is estimated accordingly to be at least 1000 and at most 10,000 taking a theoretical white dwarf mass distribution and a double exponential scale height distribution for the gas and the source distribution into account and under the assumption that the observationally derived sample is restricted to white dwarf masses above @xmath2 .",
    "this range of a population has to be compared with the range of a population of @xmath4800 - 5000 sources as predicted from population synthesis calculations .",
    "we find the source population scale height to be @xmath4300  pc for a scale height for the gas of 150 - 600  pc .",
    "this is consistent with a young stellar population . assuming a life time as a steadily nuclear burning white dwarf ( a supersoft source ) of @xmath13 and that all supersoft sources with masses in excess of @xmath6 are progenitors of supernovae of type ia , a sn ia rate of @xmath120 is inferred for m31 based on these progenitors .",
