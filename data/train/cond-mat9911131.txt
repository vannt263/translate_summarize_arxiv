    "shortly after the discovery of superconductivity in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , the possibility of spin triplet pairing was discussed.@xcite possible pairing symmetries were also classified based on the crystal symmetry.@xcite on the experimental front , there have been attempts to single out the right pairing symmetry among these possibilities .",
    "recent measurement of @xmath9o - knight shift in nmr for the magnetic field parallel to the @xmath10 plane showed no change across @xmath8 , which can be taken as the evidence of the spin triplet pairing with @xmath11-vector parallel to the @xmath12-axis.@xcite here @xmath11 is called the spin vector which is perpendicular to the direction of the spin associated with the condensed pair@xcite .",
    "@xmath13sr experiment found spontaneous magnetic field in the superconducting sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , which seems to indicate broken time reversal symmetry in the superconducting state .",
    "@xcite these experiment may be compatible with the following order parameter @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the magnitude of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "notice that this state is analogous to the @xmath16 phase of @xmath4he and there is a full gap on the fermi surface .",
    "on the other hand , there also exist experiments that can not be explained by a naive application of the order parameter given by eq.(1 ) .",
    "earlier specific heat measurement found residual density of states at low temperatures below @xmath8@xcite , which provokes the ideas of orbital dependent superconductivity@xcite and even non - unitary superconducting state@xcite .",
    "however , more recent specific heat experiment on a cleaner sample reports no residual density of states and it was found that the specific heat behaves as @xmath17 at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite this result stimulated a speculation about different order parameters with line node@xcite .",
    "however , since there are three bands labeled by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 which cross the fermi surface , it is not yet clear whether the order parameter given by eq.(1 ) is compatible with more recent specific heat data or not .",
    "for example , it is possible that the pairing symmetry associated with the @xmath20 band is still given by eq.(1 ) while the order parameter symmetry associated with @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands can be quite different . in this case , the low temperature specific heat will be dominated by the excitations from @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands . in order to resolve the issue , it is important to examine other predictions of the given order parameter and compare the results with future experiments .",
    "one way of identifying the correct order parameter among possible candidates is to investigate the unique collective modes supported by the ground state with a given pairing symmetry .",
    "the observation of the effects of these collective modes would provide convincing evidence for a particular order parameter symmetry .",
    "if we assume that the order parameter of eq.(1 ) is realized in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , the superconducting state would support unique collective modes , the so - called clapping mode and spin waves as well as the phase and amplitude modes of the order parameter which exist also in @xmath21-wave superconductors .",
    "previously we studied the dynamics of spin waves @xcite . a possible way to distinguish the order parameter of the @xmath20 band from those of the @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) band",
    "was also proposed in the context of spin wave dynamics.@xcite    in this paper , we study the dynamics of the sound wave and its coupling to the clapping modes assuming that the order parameter is given by eq.(1 ) . as in @xmath4he ,",
    "only the clapping mode can couple to the sound wave and affects its dynamics .",
    "here we study the sound velocities and attenuation coefficients of the longitudinal and transverse sound waves .",
    "in particular , we identify the clapping mode with the frequency , @xmath22 , and examine the effects of this mode and disorder on the sound wave propagation .    in a recent paper , higashitani and nagai@xcite",
    "obtained the clapping mode with the frequency , @xmath23 , and discussed the possible coupling to the sound wave independent of us .",
    "it is , however , important to realize that the coupling to the sound wave is extermely small because @xmath24 in metals , where @xmath25 is the sound velocity .",
    "indeed the recent measurement of the sound velocity in the normal and superconducting states of sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 reported in @xcite shows that @xmath24 .",
    "they measured the sound velocities of the longitudinal modes , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 $ ] ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 $ ] ) , and the transverse modes , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 $ ] , @xmath32 $ ] ) and @xmath33 ( @xmath31 $ ] , @xmath34 $ ] ) , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the directions of propagation and the polarization of ultrasound , respectively .",
    "they found that the longitudinal sound velocities , @xmath26 and @xmath28 , decrease with a kink at @xmath37 , while the transverse sound velocities do not exhibit any effect of the onset of superconductivity .",
    "we estimate from their experimental data that @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the longitudinal sound velocity .",
    "it can be also seen that the transverse sound velocity , @xmath40 , is much smaller than the longitudinal one @xcite .",
    "incorporating the correct limit , @xmath24 , we obtained the sound velocities and attenuation coefficients for both collisionless and diffusive limits .",
    "in the diffusive limit , the quasi - particle scattering due to impurities should be properly taken into account .",
    "one can show that , in a metal like sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , the collisionless limit is rather difficult to reach because it can be realized only for @xmath41 ghz . for more practical range of frequencies ,",
    "khz @xmath42 mhz , the diffusive limit may be easier to achieve .",
    "on the other hand , we found that it is much easier to see the effects of the coupling between the sound waves and the clapping mode in the collisionless limit .",
    "therefore it is worthwhile to study both regimes .",
    "here we summarize our main results .",
    "0.1 cm * a. collisionless limit *    in the absence of the coupling to the clapping mode , the longitudinal sound velocity decreases in the superconducting state because the effect of the screening of the coulomb potential increases , which happens in the s - wave superconductors as well .",
    "however , one of the important features of the @xmath0-wave order parameter in consideration is that the sound wave can now couple to the clapping mode .",
    "this effect is absent in @xmath21-wave superconductors .",
    "one can show that , among longitudinal waves , @xmath26 mode can couple to the clapping mode , but @xmath28 mode can not .",
    "we found that the longitudinal sound velocity @xmath26 decreases as @xmath43 \\ .\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the couping constant and @xmath45 is the superfluid density .",
    "@xmath46 is the relative shift in the sound velocity .",
    "we estimated the frequency regime where one can observe the effect of the clapping mode and found that the effect is visible if @xmath47 .",
    "this implies that @xmath48 ghz . since @xmath28 does not couple to the clapping mode",
    ", the velocity change is simply given by @xmath49 \\ .\\ ] ]    since the velocity of the transverse wave is much smaller than that of the longitudinal one and the coupling to the electron system is weaker than the longitudinal case as well , we expect that the change of the transverse sound velocity is hard to observe . in order to complete the discussion",
    ", we also present the results for these small changes in transverse velocities . here",
    "only @xmath33 mode couples to the clapping mode , and @xmath30 mode does not .",
    "we found @xmath50 \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath51 \\ , \\ ] ] where the @xmath52 is the transverse coupling constant .",
    "we also found that the leading contribution to the attenuation coefficient is the same as that of @xmath21-wave superconductors in the collisionless limit .",
    "0.1 cm * b. diffusive limit *    this case corresponds to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the scattering rate due to impurities .",
    "as in the case of the collisionless limit , in principle @xmath26 and @xmath33 modes couple to the clapping mode , but it turns out that the effect is almost impossible to detect . neglecting the coupling to the clapping mode and working in the limit @xmath55 , we obtain the following results near @xmath8 .",

    "the shift of the sound velocity and attenuation coefficient decrease linearly in @xmath58 as @xmath59 .",
    "this result for the longitudinal sound wave is consistent with the experimental observation reported in @xcite    in the case of the transverse sound waves , the leading behaviors of the sound velocity and the attenuation coeffient can be obtained simply by replacing @xmath39 and @xmath44 by @xmath40 and @xmath52 in the diffusive limit . however , the absolute value of the transverse sound velocity is much smaller than the longitudinal one and the coupling to the electron system is also much weaker than the case of the longitudinal sound waves .",
    "thus , it would be hard to observe any change at @xmath37 for the transverse wave .",
    "this may explain the experimental finding that the transverse velocity does not show any change across @xmath8 .",
    "we also obtained the attenuation coefficient for all temperatures below @xmath8 .",
    "it is given by eq.([att ] ) and fig.2 shows its behavior .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the clapping mode is briefly discussed . in section iii , we provide a brief summary of the formalism used in ref.@xcite to explain how the sound velocity and the attenuation coefficients are related to the autocorrelation functions of the stress tensor .",
    "we present the results of the study on the sound propagation in the collisionless and diffusive limits in sections iv and v , respectively .",
    "we conclude in section vi .",
    "further details which are not presented in the main text are relegated to the appendix a and b.",
    "as in the @xmath21-wave superconductors , the phase and amplitude modes of the order parameter also exist in the @xmath0-wave superconductors . on the other hand , due to the internal structure of the cooper pair in the @xmath0-wave superconductor ,",
    "there exist other types of collective mode associated with the order parameter .",
    "the nature of these modes is determined by the structure of the order parameter .",
    "there are collective modes associated with the oscillation of the spin vector @xmath11 , which we have already discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there exists another collective mode associated with the orbital part .",
    "using the notation @xmath60 , the oscillation of the orbital part @xmath61 gives rise to the clapping mode with @xmath62 .",
    "this mode couples to the sound waves as we will see in the next section .",
    "therefore , the detection of the clapping mode will provide a unique evidence for the @xmath0-wave superconducting order parameter .",
    "the derivation of the clapping mode and the coupling to the sound wave is discussed in appendix a.",
    "in ordinary liquids , the sound wave is a density wave . in superconductors ,",
    "the density is not only coupled to the longitudinal component of the normal velocity , but also to the superfluid velocity and to temperature .",
