    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) constitute a young neutron star population with some extreme properties .",
    "they show short ( @xmath4 s ) super - eddington soft gamma burst ( @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ) .",
    "three giant bursts ( @xmath7 erg s@xmath6 ) were observed from three different sgrs . for most axp / sgrs , quiescent x - ray luminosities ( @xmath8@xmath9 erg s@xmath6 ) are much higher than the rotational powers @xmath10 of the sources .",
    "all known @xmath11 axp / sgrs have the rotational periods clustered in the @xmath12-@xmath13 s range ( see mereghetti 2008 for a review of axp / sgrs ) .",
    "some of these sources exhibit x - ray outbursts ( enhancements ) after the burst episodes .",
    "these x - ray outbursts can be explained in the frames of both the magnetar model ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) and the fallback disc model ( chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ; alpar 2001 ) . in the magnetar model ,",
    "part of the energy powering the burst is injected into the crust ; the resultant heating and subsequent cooling of the crust produce the observed outburst light curve ( see , e.g. , camero et al .",
    "2014 ) . in the fallback disc model , part of the burst energy is absorbed by the inner disc .",
    "the inner disc matter is pushed back by the burst , and piles up at a larger radius forming a density gradient .",
    "starting from this initial condition , the disc evolves with an abruptly enhanced mass - flow and accretion rate leading to the onset of the x - ray outburst .",
    "subsequently , the accretion rate decreases with the relaxation of the disc , and produces the decay phase of the x - ray light curve .",
    "this model can explain the the x - ray outburst light curves of different axp / sgrs with the same basic disc parameters (  & ertan 2012 ) .",
    "the explanation of the long - term evolution of axp / sgrs is also rather different in the magnetar and the fallback disc models . in the magnetar model",
    ", these sources are evolving in vacuum and are slowed down by magnetic dipole torques . with this assumption ,",
    "the strength of the dipole field on the surface of the neutron star is estimated from the observed period and period derivative of the source using @xmath14 g , which gives @xmath15 g for most axp / sgrs . in this model ,",
    "the explanation of the x - ray luminosity and the rotational properties of axp / sgrs requires the decay of the magnetic dipole field .",
    "the required decay is very rapid for some sources ( turolla et al .",
    "2011 ; vigano et al .",
    "2013 ) , while it is negligible for some others ( e.g. camero et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the decay rate of the dipole field depends mainly on the strength of the initial crustal toroidal field .",
    "for instance , for a neutron star to reach the properties of the so - called low - b magnetar sgr @xmath16+@xmath17 , it should have an initial toroidal field stronger than @xmath18 g ( turolla et al .",
    "2011 ) . for a second low - b magnetar swift j1822.31606",
    ", the model needs an initial crustal toroidal field with a strength of a few @xmath19 g.    in the fallback disc model , explanation of the optical emission and the long - term evolution of axp / sgrs requires conventional dipole fields of young neutron stars ( @xmath20@xmath21 g ) .",
    "the sgr bursts are likely to be powered by strong magnetic fields ( @xmath15 g ) on the surface of the star as described in the magnetar model .",
    "nevertheless , these magnetar fields could be in the small - scale quadrupole fields rather than the dipole component as indicated by the observations of low - b magnetars . in the fallback disk model , the dipole component of the magnetic field interacts with the inner disc , while the higher multipoles do not affect the rotational evolution of the neutron star .",
    "this means that small - scale magnetar fields close to the surface of the star is compatible with the disc model .",
    "however , a hybrid model with a fallback disc around a magnetar dipole field can not produce observed rotational properties , in particular the period clustering of axp / sgrs ( alpar 2001 ; eki & alpar 2003 ; ertan et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) .    in the fallback disc model ,",
    "the torque acting on the neutron star is provided by the disc .",
    "the sources enter a long - lasting accretion phase at some early phase of evolution depending on the initial conditions : dipole field strength , initial period and the disc mass .",
    "the sources experience the most efficient torque in the accretion phase . the mass accretion on to the star powers the x - ray luminosity .",
    "before the onset and after the termination of the accretion phase , the x - ray luminosity is produced by the intrinsic cooling of the neutron star .",
    "this model can produce the basic x - ray and the rotational properties of axp / sgrs ( ertan & erkut 2008 ; ertan et al . 2009 ) , dim isolated neutron stars ( ertan et al .",
    "2014 ) , low - b magnetars ( alpar , ertan & alikan 2011 ; benli et al .",
    "2013 ) , and the so - called high - b radio pulsar  psr j17343333 , which has an anomalous breaking index @xmath22 (  et al . 2013 ) . in this model ,",
    "the dipole field strength required for all these different sources is less than @xmath21 g , and the low - b magnetars with apparently extreme properties are just ordinary axp / sgrs in a relatively late phase of their long - term evolution .",
    "consistent with these results , the typical high - energy ( @xmath23 kev ) spectra of axp / sgrs can be accounted for by the bulk - motion comptonization in the accretion columns of neutron stars with the accretion rates indicated by the x - ray luminosities of these sources ( trmper et al .",
    "2010 , 2013 ; kylafis , trmper & ertan 2014 ) .",
    "recently camero et al .",
    "( 2014 ) performed model fits to the x - ray outburst light curve of 501 , a typical sgr , and also present the long - term evolutionary scenario expected for this source in the magnetar model .",
    "the model requires an initial dipole field of strength @xmath24 g on the pole .",
    "since the current dipole field on the pole ( @xmath25 g ) inferred from the dipole formula is similar to the initial field , there is either negligible or no field decay for this source in this model .    in the present work ,",
    "we analyze both the enhancement light curve and the long - term evolution of 501 with the fallback disc model .",
    "we also compare the estimated optical / infrared ( ir ) flux of the disc with the observed data .",
    "we describe the model parameters briefly , and give the results for the short and the long - term evolution models in sections 2 and 3 respectively .",
    "properties of 501 indicated by our results are discussed and compared to those of the low - b magnetars and high - b radio pulsar   psr j17343333 .",

    "the source was observed by rxte following the swift detection and a period of 5.762067(2 ) s was found from the coherent x - ray pulsations ( g , woods & kouveliotou 2008 ) .",
    "the source also showed optical pulsations with a period of 5.7622 @xmath26 0.0003 s which is in good agreement with the x - ray spin period ( dhillon et al .",
    "2011 ) . the subsequent observations with combined _ rxte / pca , swift / xrt , cxo / acis - s _ and _ xmm - newton / epic - pn _ observations revealed a period derivative of @xmath27 s s@xmath6 ( g et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the minimum distance to 501 is estimated to be @xmath28 1.5 kpc based on a likely association of the source with the supernova remnant hb9 ( aptekar et al .",

    "the bolometric luminosities obtained from these models are @xmath34 erg s@xmath6 and @xmath35 erg s@xmath6 for distances 1.5 and 5 kpc .    in this section ,",

    "independent of the disc mass , the dipole field strength on the pole of the star is well constrained to a narrow range with @xmath59 g which is more than two orders of magnitude weaker than that inferred from the dipole torque formula .",
    "since the source does not come close to the rotational equilibrium , @xmath60   and remains almost constant in the accretion phase ( see e.g.  et al .",
    "2013 for the @xmath61 behaviour in different phases of evolution ) .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "1 that the x - ray luminosity ( upper panel ) , the period ( middle panel ) and the period derivative ( bottom panel ) are reached simultaneously by the model sources in the accretion phase at an age @xmath1 yr which is about 2 times greater than the characteristic age ( @xmath62 ) of 501 . the source could remain in the accretion phase ( constant @xmath61 phase ) until an age @xmath63@xmath3 yr depending on its actual initial disc mass .",
    "the accretion epoch terminates when the inner disc can not penetrate the light cylinder , and the system enters the tracking phase with @xmath43 . during the tracking phase , @xmath61 decreases with decreasing @xmath38 , that is , the maximum @xmath61 is obtained in the accretion phase .",
    "it is also possible that some of the sources could start their evolution in the tracking phase with an inefficient torque . whether these sources can enter the accretion phase at a later time of evolution depends on the initial period , @xmath55 , for a given dipole field and disk mass",
    "if @xmath55 is below a minimum critical value the disk torque can not sufficiently slow - down the neutron star such that the inner disk can never penetrate the light cylinder in the active lifetime of the disk . in this case , @xmath61 decreases continuously converging to the @xmath61 level of the dipole torque .",

    "the details and applications of our x - ray enhancement model can be found in  & ertan ( 2012 ) .",
    "the model can be summarized as follows : the disc in the quiescent state mimics a steady state geometrically thin disc and evolves with @xmath81 .",
    "part of the energy emitted during a burst episode moves the inner disc matter to a larger radii .",
    "this causes the inner disc mater to pile - up at the inner disc which we represent by a gaussian mass distribution as the initial condition in our model . the evolution of this density gradient first leads to an abrupt increase in the mass - flow rate of the inner disc , the accretion rate on to the star and thus the x - ray luminosity .",
    "subsequently , the x - ray luminosity decreases with a rate governed by the viscous relaxation of the disc yielding the decay phase of the x - ray luminosity .",

    "the available absorbed data for the first @xmath82 d of the decay phase were obtained from different satellites , and with fits to different spectral models . due to difficulties in obtaining the unabsorbed x - ray data of this source in a systematic way ,  & ertan ( 2012 ) used the absorbed x - ray data considering also that the absorption does not significantly affect the light curve close to the peak of the outburst when the x - ray luminosity and the temperatures are sufficiently high .    from 150 to 600 d of the decay phase ,",
    "the x - ray light curve gradually decreased to the quiescent x - ray flux level of the source ( camero et al .",
