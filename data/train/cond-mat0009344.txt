    "the electronic transport properties of quantum dots , defined in two - dimensional electron gases in semiconductor heterostructures , have received considerable theoretical as well as experimental attention . @xcite in the coulomb blockade regime , where the quantum dot is only weakly coupled to reservoirs via tunnel barriers , the conductance through the dot shows striking oscillations as a function of a gate voltage which tunes the electrochemical potential inside the dot .",
    "the separation between these so - called coulomb blockade ( cb ) resonances contains information not only on the single electron charging energy of the dot , but also on its internal energy structure . within the widely used constant - interaction approximation,@xcite the addition spectrum",
    "can be decomposed into an electrostatic component given by the total capacitance of the dot , and a chemical component , which reflects the dot s single particle energy spectrum .",
    "the fock - darwin spectrum@xcite has been successfully employed in many experiments to describe the energy level spectrum of quantum dots.@xcite these experiments are thus consistent with a harmonic confinement potential in two dimensions ; to our knowledge , transport signatures of non - parabolic confinement in quantum dots have not been reported yet .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that quantum dots with a hard - wall potential have been fabricated by cleaved - edge overgrowth@xcite and by self - assembly@xcite .",
    "+ the option of patterning quantum dots ( and other nanostructures ) with hard walls by lithographical means is of interest from both a technological as well as from a physical point of view .",
    "one consequence of steep walls is , for example , only a small reduction of the fermi energy in quantum dots as compared to the bulk value .",
    "electrostatic considerations have established a relation between the potential steepness and the depletion length.@xcite thus , steeper confinement is a prerequisite for higher pattern densities .",
    "also , changes in size and shape are reduced as a gate voltage is tuned .",
    "this is of particular importance for statistical properties of quantum dots .",
    "@xcite in addition , recent theoretical results on conductance fluctuations in quantum dots at small magnetic fields are valid only for a hard - wall confinement.@xcite we also mention the generalized kohn theorem,@xcite which states that in parabolic potentials , the far infrared conductivity exhibits only a single resonance that corresponds to the characteristic frequency of the bare potential , independent of electron - electron interactions .",
    "+ in the present paper , we report the fabrication and characterization of quantum dots with super - parabolic confinement potentials .",
    "the steepness of the walls is increased by combining local oxidation using an atomic force microscope ( afm ) with an additional top gate electrode .",
    "magnetotransport experiments are used to map out the dots addition spectra , from which the energy levels are reconstructed .",
    "the essential idea is to detect a super - parabolic confinement via the dots energy spectrum in magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the two - dimensional electron gas ( fig .",
    "1 ) : for small landau level filling factors , a parabolic confinement and a hard - wall confinement generate quite different energy spectra .",
    "+ we have patterned two quantum dots of different size and fabrication parameters for the present study : for the smaller dot ( labelled `` dot s '' ) , the spectrum measured is in qualitative agreement with the fock - darwin model .",
    "however , a quantitative analysis reveals inconsistencies , which dissolve by assuming a hard - wall confinement . for the larger dot ( referred to as `` dot l '' ) ,",
    "the energy spectrum differs _ qualitatively _ from a fock - darwin spectrum , and indicates a super - parabolic confinement . + it is well known that in the regime of small filling factors , a single - particle picture fails to explain the full phenomenology of quantum dots , and charge - density model calculations are used instead .",
    "@xcite therefore , we demonstrate that within a charge - density model , our observations can be explained by a steep - wall confinement as well .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , the theoretical energy spectra of parabolic dots and hard - wall dots are compared . in section iii , we describe the sample preparation , the experimental setup , and the electronic characterization of two quantum dots . in section iv ,",
    "the energy level spectra of the dots are reconstructed from magnetotransport measurements and the results are discussed .",
    "in addition , we estimate the steepness of the walls . a summary and conclusion is given in section v.",
    "for a circular dot with a parabolic confinement , characterized by the confining strength @xmath1 , the energy spectrum is the well - known fock - darwin spectrum@xcite ( fig .",
    "1a ) : @xmath2 here , we have transformed the radial quantum number m and the angular momentum quantum number @xmath3 from the standard representation into the landau level index n ( n=1,2,3 ,  ) and the level index k of the state within a landau level ( k=0,1,2 ,  ) , @xmath4 and @xmath5.@xcite furthermore , @xmath6 denotes the cyclotron frequency , and each level is assumed to be two - fold spin - degenerate . throughout the paper , we restrict ourselves to magnetic fields in which only two spin - degenerate landau levels are occupied , and label the spin - degenerate landau level n as ll(n ) , n = 1,2 .",
    "consequently , the spin - resolved filling factor @xmath7 is always in the regime 2 @xmath8 4 .",
    "+ a corresponding section of the fock - darwin spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "we have chosen typical experimental numbers : a dot radius of r = 200 nm , and @xmath9 = 1 mev .",
    "as the magnetic field is tuned , the fermi level varies in zigzag lines , representing the transfer of electrons between the two landau levels .",
    "the energies of ll(1)-states drop as b is increased , while those of ll(2)-states increase .",
    "a quasi - periodic level crossing between ll(1)-states and ll(2)-states is obtained .",
    "furthermore , the density of states is identical in both landau levels . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the separation between adjacent states with identical n can be estimated as @xmath11 , and the period in b is approximated to first order by @xmath12 , as can be seen from eq.(1 ) .",
    "these approximations are in reasonable agreement with @xmath13 and @xmath14 in fig .",

    "@xmath14 is well approximated by @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 , however , depends sensitively on n , k and the magnetic field .",
    "+ we note that in the model considerations above , we have neglected spins for clarity .",
    "inclusion of the twofold occupation of each orbital state due to spin is necessary for a quantitative comparison of the models with the experimental data below , and reduces all the above average energy level separations and magnetic field periods by a factor of two .",
    "the samples are patterned out of a shallow ga[al]as heterostructure with the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) @xmath22 nm below the surface .",
    "the quantum dots are defined by local oxidation with an afm.@xcite the height of the oxide lines is roughly equal to the penetration depth of the oxidation into the heterostructure .",
    "an oxidation depth of approximately 6 nm depletes the 2deg underneath .",
    "we find that the lateral depletion length @xmath23 can be tailored by the oxidation parameters : @xmath23 increases as the height of the oxide line is increased .",
    "the details of this mechanism are still under investigation.@xcite in a simple picture , however , the oxidation can be understood as a shallow removal of the semiconductor layers , starting at the surface .",
    "removing the oxidized material selectively by a wet etching step does not change the electronic properties of the afm defined nanostructures .",
    "we conclude that the patterned surfaces behave pretty much like a free gaas ( or al@xmath24ga@xmath25as , respectively ) surface , i.e. , the fermi energy is pinned about mid - gap . below the oxidized line , the sample surface has moved closer to the 2deg , which can lead to a depletion of the mobile electrons .",
    "crucial for the magnitude of the lateral depletion length is the depth of the oxidation process . in shallow 2degs",
    "it is well known that most of the electrons originating from the si donors charge surface states , while only a small fraction of them ( typically 10 % ) go to the heterointerface and lead to the mobile carriers .",
    "the oxidized sample surface requires additional electrons per area .",
    "if the donor layer remains intact after the oxidation process , these additional electrons are taken from the underlying 2deg , which is consequently depleted .",
    "the lateral depletion length is therefore roughly determined by the distance between the donor layer and the 2deg .",
    "if , however , the oxidation process penetrates down to the donors ( a si @xmath26-layer located 16 nm below the surface ) , they become electronically inactive in this area , and charges from the neighboring , still intact si - donors have to compensate the surface potential in the oxidized regions . consequently",
    ", these electrons are now missing for the population of the 2deg in the vicinity of the oxide lines , and an increased depletion length results .",
    "we estimate that @xmath23 is now roughly given by the distance between the 2deg and the unpatterned sample surface .",
    "this line of thought is sketched in figs .",
    "2c , d. furthermore , the depletion process is supported by the generation of additional surface states at the edges of the oxidized trenches .",
    "+ dot s is defined by oxide lines with an average height of roughly 20 nm and a width of 100 nm .",
    "its lithographic size is 280 nm@xmath27280 nm ( fig .",
    "the oxide penetrates about 20 nm into the heterostructure and most likely reaches the donor layer .",
    "dot l has a lithographic area of 400 nm@xmath27420 nm . here , the oxide lines are kept as shallow as possible ( height 10 nm ) .",
    "+ after the local oxidation , the samples are covered with a homogeneous top gate ( tg ) electrode . in figs . 2c and d ,",
    "schematic cross sections through the dots are shown .",
    "the measurements were carried out in the mixing chamber of a @xmath28he/@xmath29he - dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of @xmath30 .",
    "the electron density of the ungated two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) was 5.5 @xmath31 10@xmath32m@xmath33 , and its mobility was 90 m@xmath34/vs .",
    "dc bias voltages of 20 @xmath35v were applied across the dot from source to drain , and the current was measured with a resolution of 500 fa .",
    "the measurements were performed in the weak coupling regime , where the quantum point contacts are adjusted to the tunneling regime by voltages applied to the qpc gates in figs .",
    "the conductance is measured as a function of @xmath36 , the gate voltage applied to gate i , and coulomb blockade ( cb ) oscillations are observed ( figs .",
    "fits of single cb resonances to the lineshape expected for coherent single - level transport,@xcite i.e. , @xmath37 , reveal an electron temperature of @xmath38 = 140 mk ( @xmath39 denotes the resonance frequency ) .",
    "magnetic fields up to b = 12 t could be applied perpendicular to the 2deg .",
    "+ from measurements of the cb diamonds,@xcite we determine the single electron charging energies of @xmath40 = 1.22 mev for dot s , and @xmath41 = 180 @xmath35ev for dot l. by measuring the coulomb blockade period as a function of the top gate voltage and using the parallel plate capacitor expression , dot s can be modelled as a circular disc with a radius of r @xmath42 90 nm , which corresponds to @xmath23 @xmath42 50 nm at @xmath43 = + 100 mv , the working point for this device .",
    "the average single - particle energy level spacing can thus be estimated to @xmath44 = 140 @xmath35ev .",
    "the bulk electron density for this top gate voltage was @xmath45 . at b = 8.8 t , the second landau level is depleted inside the dot , which manifests itself in a sudden transition of the phase diagram structure ( not shown)@xcite .",
    "thus , the electron density inside the dot is reduced by @xmath46 , compared to the two - dimensional value .",
    "l , the single electron charging energy is @xmath41 = 180 @xmath35ev , and from the capacitance between the top gate and the dot , we deduce an electronic dot area of @xmath42 400 nm @xmath31 400 nm .",
    "the shallow oxidation , in combination with a large positive top gate voltage of + 390 mv ( such that the second two - dimensional subband is still empty ) generates extremely small depletion lengths of @xmath47 15 nm @xcite and is expected to maximize the steepness of the walls ( fig .",

    "we have determined @xmath51 from measurements of the coulomb blockade diamonds at b = 0.@xcite in regions where the levels move downwards in energy , their amplitude is high , while in regions where they move upwards in energy , their amplitude is strongly suppressed .",
    "regions of high conductance occur when a state belonging to ll(1 ) aligns with the fermi level in source and drain . as the magnetic field increases",
    ", their energy is reduced . on the other hand , states belonging to ll(2 ) will move upwards in energy as b is increased , leading to their depopulation . since the ll(2 ) states are residing in the inner region of the dot ( fig .",
    "1b ) , their coupling to the leads is small , which results in a strongly suppressed peak amplitude . + a similar measurement for dot l , fig .",

    "in contrast to dot s , the separation between successive stripes of high conductance in @xmath36 - direction does _ not _ correspond to one cb period at b=0 , but rather to 2.5 cb periods on average .",

    "in this section , we construct the energy level spectra of the two dots from the measurements of figs . 2e and f.",
    "while this is straightforward for dot s , it requires a more detailed understanding of the addition spectrum measured for dot l , which we gather from activated transport experiments .",
    "the spectra obtained will be compared to the model potentials described in section ii , with the spin splitting included .",
    "+      in fig .",

    "+ the fock - darwin model in the limit of strong magnetic fields states that @xmath64 ( the factor of @xmath65 takes the spin splitting into account ) , from which we obtain @xmath66 2.75 mev , an at first sight reasonable , although large value .",
    "further analysis , however , reveals problems with the interpretation in terms of a fock - darwin model : + ( i ) since @xmath67 nm , we can calculate @xmath68 inside the dot from @xmath69 , which would result in @xmath70 mev , _ larger _ than in the 2deg .",
    "+ ( ii ) we observe @xmath71b = 75 mt . within the fock - darwin model in strong magnetic fields , however , @xmath72 180 mt , is expected .",
    "+ ( iii ) the slope of the energy levels , @xmath73 ( i denotes the ll index ) deviates from the fock - darwin values : here , @xmath74 , as observed experimentally in previous work.@xcite however , we estimate @xmath75 , which is much too large , even considering the experimental uncertainty in @xmath76 .",
    "+ these inconsistencies can be significantly reduced by assuming a hard - wall potential .",
    "we measure @xmath77 80 mt , in reasonable agreement with the @xmath20 expected for r = 90 nm .",
    "also , both the energy level separation and @xmath78 can be much larger than in a parabolic dot .",
    "+ hence , although the behavior of dot s is in qualitative agreement with a parabolic confinement , a quantitative analysis suggests that its confinement resembles a hard - wall potential .      the period in @xmath36 of the conductive regionsin dot l does not correspond to the coulomb blockade oscillation period at b=0 , as it does in dot s. in order to obtain more information on the states with suppressed conductance , we measured the coulomb diamonds , i.e. the conductance as a function of both @xmath36 and the source - drain voltage @xmath79 , at b = 8 t ( fig .",
    "4 ) . at _ large _ bias voltages , i.e. for @xmath80 , an average cb oscillation period of @xmath81 mv",
    "is observed , slightly smaller than @xmath54 observed at b=0 .",
    "as @xmath82 is reduced , the conductance gets suppressed for 70 @xmath83 of the cb resonances , corresponding to a ratio between suppressed peaks and visible peaks of 2.5:1 .",
    "the conductance doublets in @xmath84-direction , fig .",
    "2f , remain visible at small @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , the shape of the diamonds with suppressed conductance tends to follow the shape of the nearest diamond in which the conductance outside the coulomb blockade is not suppressed , which indicates that the activated current flows predominantly via ll(1 ) states .",
    "these observations lead us to conclude that the density of ll(2 ) states at the fermi level is about 2.5 times the density of ll(1 ) states .",
    "ll(2 ) states get occupied when aligned with the fermi energy , but since their coupling to the leads is negligible , transport via these states is not measurable , even at large @xmath79 .",
    "rather , transport occurs via excitation of ll(1 ) states .",
    "+ with this information , we are now able to reconstruct the energy level spectrum of dot l by subtracting the @xmath85 from the addition spectrum of fig .",
    "2f . the phase diagram is shown in fig . 3c . here",
    ", we have determined the phase boundaries due to ll(2 ) states from the activated transport measurements of fig .",
    "4 , concluding that we must cross @xmath42 2.5 ll(2)-states on average between adjacent ll(1)-states .",
    "the zigzag lines obtained are again separated by one coulomb period in @xmath36 , and it can be seen that the different structure originates in the fact that most states at the fermi level couple extremely poorly to the leads .",
    "we point out that alternative choices of the phase boundaries are inconsistent not only with the activated transport measurements , but also with other considerations : if we were to assume that the ll(2 ) states run like the white , dashed line connecting point 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "3c , we would cross 3.5 ll(2 ) states on average between adjacent ll(1 ) states .",
    "in addition , all energy levels would run downwards in energy as b is increased , which would lead to an unphysical population of the dot with electrons by increasing b. if we , on the other hand , were to assume that the ll(2 ) states run parallel to the line between point 1 and 3 , we would cross equally many ll(2 ) states as ll(1 ) states as @xmath36 is tuned , in clear contradiction to the activated transport experiments .",
    "also , the slope of the ll(2 ) states would be 25 mev / t , which is approximately one order of magnitude larger than their maximum slope of @xmath86 , and we would obtain an unphysically small period for the `` magneto - coulomb blockade oscillations'',@xcite which means that a change in magnetic field of only 10 mt would be sufficient to change the total number of electrons in the dot by one .",
    "+ performing the same procedure as before , we reconstruct the energy spectrum of dot l , fig .",
    "an energy level separation between ll(1 ) states of @xmath87 = 160 @xmath35ev , and @xmath88 = 60 @xmath35ev for ll(2 ) is found .",
    "hence , the density of ll(2 ) states at the fermi level is 2.5 times greater than the density of ll(1 ) states , which indicates a significant deviation from a fock - darwin potential .",
    "in addition , note that @xmath14 = 13 mt = @xmath89 .",
    "this is expected for a hard - wall dot , since for each additional flux quantum , two ll(1 ) states are generated .",
    "+ we thus conclude that the energy spectrum of dot l deviates even qualitatively from the fock - darwin model , but agrees well with a hard - wall confinement . in table",
    "i , we compare the parameters of the two dots .",
    "+      so far , we have discussed the energy level spectra within a single - particle picture , and found strong evidence for super - parabolic confinement .",
    "it is , however , well - known that certain aspects of the energy spectrum of quantum dots can not be understood in such a simple picture , but are rather interpreted in terms of a charge - density model.@xcite this is particularly true when strong magnetic fields are present , @xcite and therefore raises the question whether our observations hint towards steep walls also within a charge - density model . to answer this issue , we study the depletion of dot l along the vertical arrow in fig .",
    "3c , i.e. , as we proceed from point a to point e. for comparison , we first look at the depletion process within the single - particle picture . the corresponding changes in the energies @xmath90 of ll(i ) are depicted in fig .",
    "5a . at our starting point",
    "a , we have removed an electron from ll(1 ) into the reservoirs . at point",
    "b , a ll(2)-electron is transferred into the leads .",
    "this , however , does not lead to significant conductance , since the coupling of the ll(2)-states to the leads is poor . in point b ,",
    "the energy of ll(2 ) drops by @xmath88 + @xmath85 , and that one of ll(1 ) by just @xmath85 .",
    "the same process takes place at points c and d , with the corresponding energy shifts . at point",
    "e , the next ll(1)-electron is removed from the dot .",
    "consequently , 3 electrons have been removed from ll(2 ) and one from ll(1 ) . in order to repeat this process cyclically",
    ", @xmath87 has to be larger than @xmath88 .",
    "this is what we have already established above . at",
    "increased source - drain bias voltages , we would start to see activated transport via nearby ll(1)-states at some points between a and e. the magnitude of @xmath36 at such activated processes is given by the points where the black , dashed lines intersect with the arrow .",
    "the separation between the phase boundary and the arrow is a measure of the activation energy necessary .",
    "these varying activation energies give rise to the observed `` meta - diamonds '' in fig .",
    "+ within a charge - density model , the measured phase diagram gets a different interpretation:@xcite for filling factors @xmath91 , ll(1 ) forms a compressible ring at the dot edge , fig .",
    "at the fermi level , ll(2 ) is spatially separated from this ring by an incompressible region and forms a compressible disk in the dot center ; @xmath58 in fig .",
    "3c now denotes the number of electrons in the outer ring ( i=1 ) and in the center disc ( i=2 ) . here",
    ", we assume that spin splitting does not generate an additional electrostatic structure .",
    "the two compressible regions are coupled via an intra - dot capacitance @xmath92 ; charging the outer ring will now change the electrostatic energy of the inner dot by @xmath93 .",
    "if we perform a gate sweep similar to the one indicated by the arrow in fig .",
    "3b , a removal of an electron from the outer ring would change the energy of the ring by @xmath94 , and the one of the inner dot by @xmath95.@xcite similarly , removing an electron from the inner dot changes its energy by @xmath96 , and that one of the ring by @xmath95 , which gives rise to the energy ladder depicted in fig .",
    "5c . within this picture ,",
    "@xmath97 , i=1,2 reflect the single electron charging energies of the two compressible regions , and hence the size , of the outer ring and the inner dot , respectively . since @xmath98 ,",
    "the area of the ring must be smaller than the area of the inner dot .",
    "this means that the width of the outer compressible stripe , @xmath99 , is small compared to the dot radius . in previous work ,",
    "the relation between the width of the compressible regions and the potential profile has been well established:@xcite @xmath100 , where n(x ) is the local electron density and x the distance from the edge of the dot . since @xmath101 is proportional to the electric field at x ,",
    "we conclude that also within the charge - density model , the potential walls are steep .      while we observe clear signatures of super - parabolic confinement , it is not straightforward to determine the actual steepness of the walls .",
    "we can give no more than an order of magnitude estimate for the edge steepness @xmath102 . according to sivan and imry @xcite , one can approximate @xmath103 in a hard - wall dot by @xmath104 , where @xmath105 denotes the magnetic length and l the dot diameter .",
    "our measurements of @xmath103 are in good agreement with this expression , which indicates that the level separation is not strongly reduced by a finite wall steepness .",
    "we can estimate the steepness at the fermi level in dot s from the fock - darwin model , despite its shortcomings , to @xmath102 = @xmath106 , which gives @xmath107 0.6 mev / nm .",
    "furthermore , the charge - density model can be quantified in some more detail for dot l. since @xmath95 corresponds to the separation between adjacent conductive regions in fig .",
    "3c , we estimate @xmath108 .",
    "we denote the width of the outermost compressible stripe by @xmath99 , and the width of the incompressible stripe as @xmath109 ( see fig .",
    "the ratio between the area of center region and the outer ring is about 2.5 , since we have 2.5 times more levels in the inner region than in the outer ring .",
    "we use the formula for a planar capacitor@xcite to estimate the ratio @xmath110 0.5 , leading to @xmath111 25 nm and @xmath112 50 nm .",
    "the fermi energy drops completely over the distance @xmath109 .",
    "hence , we can estimate @xmath113 400 @xmath35ev / nm . this is the _ average _ wall steepness .",
    "the edge of dot l is thus about one order of magnitude steeper than in conventional dots , as estimated from self - consistent charge - density functional calculations.@xcite since the lateral depletion length is smaller in dot l than in dot s , one might qualitatively expect that the wall steepness is larger .",
