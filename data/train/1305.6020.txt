    "single nanoscopic particles such as atoms @xcite , molecules @xcite and quantum dots @xcite are an ideal probe for sub - wavelength imaging applications .",
    "a single atom , in particular , is an ultimate detector for electromagnetic ( em ) fields owing to its sub - nanometer size and strong interaction with light @xcite . for sub - wavelength imaging with single atoms , it is then necessary to localize the atoms in the nanometer scale .",
    "single ions confined in space with specially arranged electrodes have been used as a probe for mapping the transverse and axial profile of an intracavity em field @xcite .",
    "implementing such localization with single neutral atoms is rather difficult in contrast to single ions .",
    "nonetheless , a single neutral atom was tightly localized in an optical lattice in the lamb - dicke regime @xcite and its spectrum was observed to determine its inter - potential - well tunneling rate @xcite .",
    "an intracavity dipole trap was used to confine a single neutral atom near an antinode for maximum atom - cavity interaction while heating effects induced uncertain atomic delocalization @xcite . recently , three - dimensional sideband cooling @xcite was demonstrated to localize single atoms tightly in a cavity .",
    "however , it was not yet possible to scan their positions continuously in the nanometer scale for advanced photonics applications using the atom - cavity coupling constant as a variable @xcite .",
    "vacuum fluctuations , the subject of imaging in the present study , arise from the creation and annihilation of virtual particles .",
    "macroscopically , the vacuum energy density associated with the vacuum fluctuations is known to be proportional to the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "microscopically , vacuum fluctuations lead to the lamb shift @xcite and the spontaneous emission of atoms .",
    "moreover , the casimir effect @xcite was observed between two metallic plates or dielectric mirrors .",
    "the cavity vacuum , coupled with single atoms @xcite , superconducting qubits @xcite , cold atomic ensembles @xcite and bose - einstein condensates @xcite , makes it possible to perform a wide range of fundamental studies based on its spatial structure @xcite and amplified strength @xcite .",
    "although vacuum field has no classical counterpart , it is common practice to assume its spatial structure based on the solution of maxwell s equations @xcite .",
    "the rms amplitude of a vacuum field is then obtained from zero - point energy in the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) theory . under field",
    "quantization in the absence of dissipation @xcite , the root mean square ( rms ) vacuum field corresponding to a tem@xmath2 mode of a fabry - prot - type cavity is given by @xmath3}\\cos{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z}{\\lambda}\\right ) } , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] when the mirror spacing is much less than the rayleigh range .",
    "here @xmath4 is the permittivity of vacuum , @xmath5 is the mode volume , @xmath6 is the cavity mode waist , and @xmath7 is the resonant wavelength ( angular frequency ) .",
    "an excited two - level atom resonant with this vacuum field would then undergo a vacuum - field - driven transition , the rate of which for a short interaction time is proportional to the vacuum intensity @xmath8 .",
    "previously , the spatial structure of the vacuum field in a cavity was partially revealed with single trapped ions under more dominant interactions with free - space vacuum @xcite .",
    "the rms amplitude of the vacuum field was also obtained from measurements of vacuum rabi frequency 2@xmath9 with @xmath10 the atomic induced dipole moment @xcite .",
    "however , all of these measurements were either limited to a fixed atomic position with uncertain delocalization effects @xcite and unwanted displacement of the atomic equilibrium position @xcite or averaged over several wavelengths @xcite .",
    "here we introduce a nanohole array @xcite to control the atomic position and use single atoms as a nanoscopic probe for the vacuum field in the cavity .",
    "pre - excited single atoms in the cavity respond to the cavity vacuum field and emit single photons to the cavity mode .",
    "we measure the photons emitted out the cavity .",
    "the number of photons is then proportional to the vacuum - field intensity .",
    "we map out the vacuum intensity distribution by scanning the nanohole array along two transverse directions .",
    "the vacuum intensity profile along the direction of atomic beam is obtained from the transit - time broadening in the atom - cavity detuning dependence of the observed signal . in this way",
    "the 3d profile of the vacuum - field intensity is imaged with a spatial resolution of about 170 nm , which is mostly limited by the nanohole diameter .",
    "* design of experiment . * an ideal experimental scheme to image the vacuum - field intensity @xmath8 of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is sketched in fig .",
    "a key element is a nanohole atomic beam aperture , whose hole diameter is much smaller than @xmath11 .",
    "atomic position localization and short interaction time are achieved by injecting excited two - level atoms one by one at a large velocity through the nanohole aperture .",
    "the aperture position is scanned along the axial ( @xmath12 ) and transverse ( @xmath13 ) directions just in front of the cavity mode .",
    "the interaction time @xmath14 between the atom and the cavity mode is so brief that the vacuum rabi angle @xmath15 is much smaller than unity .",
    "another requirement is that the injected atom should interact mostly with the cavity vacuum .",
    "its free - space emission should be negligible during the transit through the cavity and the photon emitted by a preceding atom should decay the cavity well before the entry of the next atom .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the condition that the intracavity mean photon number @xmath16 in the steady state should be much less than unity .",
    "the atomic emission rate , and thus @xmath16 , will then be proportional to the intensity @xmath17 of the zero - point electromagnetic field fluctuating in the single cavity mode .",
    "variation of @xmath17 along the atomic path ( in the @xmath18 direction ) is encoded in the transit - time broadened atom - cavity scan curve of @xmath16 @xcite . combining this information",
    ", we can reconstruct the 3d structure of the vacuum field .",
    "the above experimental scheme performed in the _ linear _ regime ( _ i.e. _ , negligible rabi angle and @xmath19 ) does not provide the actual rms amplitude @xmath20 of the vacuum field .",
    "however , the rms amplitude can be obtained from measurements in the _ nonlinear _ regime ( _ i.e. _ , appreciable rabi angle and @xmath16 comparable to or larger than unity ) , corresponding to the emergence of one - atom lasing @xcite .",
    "this will be explained below and also in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our actual experiment depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b)-(d ) , we use a fabry - prot type cavity made of two mirrors with a 10-cm radius of curvature and a 1.09 mm mirror spacing .",
    "the resulting rayleigh range is 7.4 mm and thus the mode waist @xmath6 is expected to remain almost constant at 43 @xmath10 m ( the largest variation less than 0.1 @xmath10 m ) along the entire axial ( @xmath12 ) range of the mode .",
    "we employ a supersonic beam of @xmath21ba atoms and utilize its @xmath22s@xmath23p@xmath24 transition with @xmath11=791.1 nm and @xmath25 khz , the free - space spontaneous emission rate . the maximum atom - cavity coupling constant @xmath26 is expected to be @xmath27 khz , which surpasses @xmath28 and the cavity decay rate @xmath29 khz , thus putting our experiment in the strong coupling regime .",
    "the cooperativity parameter @xmath30 is @xmath31 .",
    "although only one nanohole is assumed in the above ideal scheme , in actual experiments it is impossible to have an intracavity mean atom number @xmath32 sufficient to yield a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio for @xmath16 even at the highest atomic beam flux when only one nanohole is used .",
    "instead , we employ an array of nanoholes with a period of @xmath33 [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ] in order to increase @xmath32 to a practical level ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 .",
    "this approach is acceptable since the vacuum field of interest is expected to be periodic along the cavity axis , based on the mode solution of maxwell s equations .",
    "it works even for an arbitrary cavity vacuum via fourier transform as discussed below and in ref .",
    "the nanoholes with a diameter of 170 nm were milled with the focused ion beam ( fib ) technique on a 75-nm - thick silicon nitride membrane [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ] .",
    "the total number of holes is 72 @xmath34 16 in the @xmath35 directions , spanning a range of 28.5 @xmath10 m @xmath34 6.3 @xmath10 m on the membrane .",
    "since the @xmath13 direction span range is much smaller than the mode waist @xmath6 , we have enough imaging resolution in that direction . + * 3d imaging of cavity vacuum . * the trace in fig .  [ fig2](a )",
    "shows the observed @xmath16 as a function of the @xmath12 coordinate of the nanohole array while its @xmath13 coordinate is fixed near the mode center ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we keep the cavity on resonance with a feed - forward technique @xcite .",
    "the oscillatory feature comes about since the atomic emission rate is enhanced / suppressed when the nanohole columns are aligned with the antinodes / nodes of the cavity vacuum . the data in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] were obtained with an optimal value of @xmath37 which simultaneously maximize the signal - to - noise and the probability of having zero photons in the cavity when each atom arrives at the mode .",
    "the probability is more than 91% , and therefore we can attribute the oscillatory feature mostly to the spatial variation of the cavity vacuum .",
    "the vacuum rabi angle @xmath38 acquired during the entire transit time along an antinode is only @xmath39 , justifying that the data were taken in the linear regime . any deviation from the linearity will show up in the fitting error @xcite . the observed @xmath16 is in good agreement with the theory curve based on the quantum master equation @xcite with a period of @xmath33 .",
    "the limited visibility in fig .  [ fig2](a ) is due to the atomic position spread after the nanoholes . in order to reveal the latent structure of the vacuum field , we deconvolved the raw data while regarding the atomic spatial distribution as a point - spread function .",
    "the richardson - lucy algorithm @xcite was used for deconvolution .",
    "combining similar traces measured for 7 different @xmath13 coordinates at a 15-@xmath10 m interval , we then obtain the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , which is proportional to an integrated @xmath40 over the @xmath18 coordinate when an atom is injected onto a point in the @xmath41 plane .",
    "fitting the trace for each @xmath13 coordinate with a sine - squared function in @xmath12 yields a resonant wavelength of @xmath11=791.0@xmath420.6 nm , consistent with the known transition wavelength of barium .",
    "the temporal profile of the vacuum field along the @xmath18 direction during the atomic transit is obtained by fourier - transforming the amplitude associated with the transit - time broadened atom - cavity scan curve in fig .",

    "the small discrepancy may draw one s attention to the long - standing problem of the field quantization in open systems , related to the sustainability of the zero - point energy and the uncertainty principle under dissipations @xcite .",
