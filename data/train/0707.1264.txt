    "optical circuits make use of light to process information .",
    "they operate at the speed of light with almost no energy dissipation , unlike electronic analogs .",
    "optical fibres  @xcite and photonic crystal fibers  @xcite have already found important applications in optical communications and optoelectronic devices . implementing ultrafast optical sources and all - optical switches based on novel ( quantum - confined ) materials , such as organic thin films and quantum dots ,  @xcite as well as silicon - based structures ,  @xcite is now in progress .",
    "the realizability of a single - photon optical switch based on warm rubidium vapor has recently been demonstrated .",
    "@xcite    a key element of any optical logic device is the optical switch , which either passes or reflects the incoming light , depending on its intensity .",
    "one possibility to design an optical switch is to utilize the phenomenon of optical bistability . since the theoretical prediction of this effect by mccall  @xcite and its experimental demonstration by gibbs , mccall , and venkatesan  @xcite for a cavity filled with potassium atoms , an extensive literature , both theoretical and experimental , has developed on this topic ( see refs .   for historical overviews and ref .   for recent developments on optical instability in wide aperture laser systems ) .",
    "a generic optical bistable element exhibits two stable stationary transmission states for the same input intensity , a property which in principle opens the door to applications such as all - optical switches , optical transistors , and optical memories .",
    "nonlinearity and feedback are the two necessary ingredients in order to enable optical bistable response of an optical system .",
    "the former can be provided , e.g. , by a saturable medium , while a cavity ( mirrors ) can serve to build up a feedback .",
    "this arrangement has been used in the first demonstration of _ controlling light with light_.  @xcite sometimes , however , the nonlinearity itself plays the role of the feedback . here",
    ", bistability is an _ intrinsic _ property of the material ; no _ external _ feedback , like a cavity , is needed .",
    "thus , mirrorless ( or cavityless ) optical bistability can be realized , which is even more advantageous from the viewpoint of designing all - optical devices . during the past decade",
    ", this type of bistability has been observed in a variety of inorganic materials heavily doped with rare - earth ions .",
    "@xcite in refs .  , a population dependent dipole - dipole interaction in ion pairs has been put forward as a nonlinearity and feedback mechanism to explain the effect .",
    "this interpretation has been debated in a number of papers .",
    "@xcite    another class of materials , promising from the viewpoint of all - optical manipulation of light , are molecular aggregates and conjugated polymers .",
    "these systems commonly exhibit narrow absorption bands and suppression of exciton - phonon coupling , superradiance and giant optical nonlinearities , fast collective optical response and efficient energy or charge transport ( see for an overview refs .  ) , which are ingredients necessary to design optoelectronics or all - optical devices . molecular aggregates and conjugated polymers",
    "have already been used to fabricate light emitting diodes  @xcite and organic solid - state lasers .",
    "@xcite    one particularly interesting effect , which has already received a considerable amount of theoretical discussion , but still awaits experimental realization , is the mirrorless optical bistability of a single molecular aggregate  @xcite or an assembly of molecular aggregates .",
    "@xcite the bistable behavior of a _ single _ linear aggregate consists of a sudden switching of the aggregate s excited state population from a low level to a higher one upon a small change of the input intensity around a critical point .",
    "the effect originates from a dynamic resonance frequency shift , which depends on the number of excited monomers in the aggregate .",
    "the origin of this shift lies in the quasi - fermionic nature of frenkel excitons in one dimension .",
    "@xcite this nonlinearity plays the role of _ intrinsic _ feedback , necessary for bistability to occur",
    ". there exists , however , a restriction on the aggregate length : an aggregate exhibits bistable behavior only if its coherence length is larger than the emission wavelength , which makes experimental realization problematic",
    ".    an _ assembly _ of molecular aggregates arranged in an ultrathin film geometry ( with the film thickness small compared to the emission wavelength ) may display intrinsic optical bistability governed by another mechanism , where the density of molecules becomes the driving parameter .",
    "the same mechanism holds for an ultrathin film of homogeneously broadened two - level systems .",
    "@xcite when the density in the film is high enough , the on - resonance refractive index can get sufficiently large to totally reflect an incoming field of low intensity .",
    "then the incoming field is almost completely compensated by a secondary field of opposite phase , which is generated by the aggregate dipoles .",
    "the dipole - induced field is bounded in magnitude , meaning that this picture only holds if the incoming field intensity is smaller than a certain value , determined by the density of aggregates . when this value is exceeded ,",
    "the aggregates become saturated , which suppresses the dipole - induced field and abruptly changes the ( nonlinear ) refractive index and transmittivity of the film . the field produced by",
    "the aggregate dipoles plays the role of _ intrinsic _ feedback .",
    "the output field depends nonlinearly on the input field of the film .    in refs .",
    "-   a thin film arrangement of oriented linear j - aggregates was considered , where the localization segments of a single disordered aggregate were modeled as independent homogeneous chains of fluctuating size .",
    "each segment was considered as a few - level system , with an individual ground state and one or two excited states corresponding to the dominant optical states of the segment . within this framework , both the ground state to one - exciton  @xcite and",
    "one - to - two  @xcite exciton transitions were taken into account , and bistable behavior was found in a certain region in the parameter space .",
    "the approach used in refs .   and   assumed full correlation of fluctuations of the lowest exciton energy and the transition dipole moment , taking both magnitudes as solely depending on the segment size . the real picture , however , is quite different .",
    "@xcite in practise the optical response of j - aggregates is strongly affected by disorder in the molecular transition energies .",
    "the band - edge of the exciton energy spectrum of such a disordered aggregate is formed by states that are localized on segments with small overlap .",
    "the lowest state of a segment is optically dominant , whereas the other states have a much smaller oscillator strength .",
    "the energy of the lowest state is not correlated with the size of the segment ; it is determined by uncorrelated well - like fluctuations of the site potential .",
    "@xcite therefore , the optically dominant states of non - overlapping segments can be arbitrarily close in energy , having at the same time completely different transition dipoles .",
    "@xcite in other words , the transition dipoles and energies of the relevant states turn out to be uncorrelated rather than correlated .    in this paper",
    ", we exploit the two - level model , implemented in refs .   and  , to describe the film s optical response . however , unlike refs .   and  , we will account properly for the statistical fluctuations of the transition dipole moment and the transition energy , as they appear after diagonalizing the frenkel exciton hamiltonian with uncorrelated on - site disorder .",
    "we calculate the joint probability distribution of these quantities and use it to compute the electric polarization of the film , which features in the maxwell equation for the field .",
    "the aggregate segment dynamics is described within the @xmath0-density matrix formalism .",
    "we derive a novel steady - state equation for the output field intensity as a function of the input intensity in terms of the joint probability distribution of the energy and the transition dipole moment . on this basis",
    ", the bistability phase diagram of the film is calculated .",
    "the critical parameter for bistability to occur turns out to be different ( larger ) than that found in refs .  .",
    "by numerically solving the truncated maxwell - bloch equations in the time domain , we study the stability of the different branches of the three - valued solution for the output field intensity .",
    "the calculation of an optical hysteresis loop ( an adiabatic up - and - down - scan of the field ) demonstrates that only two of them are stable .",
    "a new element in the paper is that we also analyze switching time between both stable branches , and show that it slows down dramatically close to the switching point .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we present the model and mathematical formalism .",
    "section  [ sec : linear regime ] deals with the linear regime of the transmission .",
    "the steady state equation for the output intensity in the nonlinear regime is derived in sec .",

    "[ sec : time - domain analysis ] , the stability of different branches is considered , together with a study of the switching time . in sec .  [",
    "sec : driving parameters ] we discuss the possibility to achieve optical bistability using j - aggregates of polymethine dyes .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] summarizes the paper .",
    "finally , in the appendix we address the effect of interference of the ground state to one - exciton transitions , originating from the fact that excitons are born from the same ground state , with all monomers being unexcited .",
    "we aim to study the transmittivity of an assembly of linear j - aggregates arranged in a thin film geometry ( with the film thickness @xmath1 small compared to the emission wavelength @xmath2 inside the film ) .",
    "all aggregates are aligned in one direction , parallel to the film plane .",
    "such an arrangement can be achieved , e.g. , by spin - coating .",
    "@xcite the limit of @xmath3 allows one to neglect the inhomogeneity of the field inside the film .",
    "the aggregates in the film are assumed to be decoupled from each other .",
    "this finds its justification in the strongly anisotropic nature of the system we have in mind . as we will see later ( sec .",
    "vi ) , films of interest for bistability should have a molecular density of the order of @xmath4 @xmath5 . with a typical separation of 1 nm between molecules within a single aggregate",
    ", this implies that neighboring aggregates are separated by 10 nm .",
    "thus , the dominant dipole - dipole interactions between molecules of different chains are a factor of 1000 weaker than those within chains . as a consequence",
    ", we expect that the former interactions will merely result in small shifts of resonance energies , away from the single - chain exciton energies considered below .",
    "on the other hand , the effect of interactions of the aggregate molecules with the surrounding host molecules is important , because as a consequence of the usually inhomogeneous nature of the host media , they lead to disorder in the molecular transition energies and in the molecular transfer integrals , both of which give rise to localization of the exciton states on segments of the aggregates .",
    "finally , thermal fluctuations in the environment result in intraband scattering of the excitons that causes two effects : equilibration of the exciton population and homogeneous broadening of the exciton levels . in this paper",
    ", we neglect the former effect .",
    "this finds its justification in many experimental studies , which have shown that the fluorescence stokes shift of j - aggregates of cyanine dyes usually is very small .",
    "@xcite )      we model a single aggregate as a linear array of @xmath6 two - level monomers with parallel transition dipoles . in this paper , we restrict ourselves to optical transitions between the ground state an the one - exciton manifold , described by the frenkel exciton hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the state in which the @xmath9th site is excited and all the other sites are in the ground state and @xmath10 is the excitation energy of site @xmath9 .",

    "the parameter @xmath16 represents the nearest - neighbor transfer interaction , which will be chosen positive ( as is appropriate for j - aggregates ) .",
    "the exciton energies @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and wavefunctions @xmath19 , are obtained as eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the @xmath20 hamilton matrix @xmath21 .    from the set of exciton states",
    "@xmath22 we only take into account the optically dominant states which , for @xmath23 , reside in the neighborhood of the low - energy bare band edge at @xmath24 .",
    "these states are located at different segments of the aggregate , which overlap weakly , and have a wavefunction with no node . therefore , they are called @xmath25-like states . to find all such states , we use the selection rule proposed in ref .  .",

    "this rule selects states with a wavefunction consisting of mainly one peak . from now on ,",
    "the state index @xmath27 will count only such @xmath25-like states .",
    "the number of these states is roughly equal to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is their typical localization size .",
    "we assume that the vibration - induced coherence length of excitons is much larger than the disorder - induced localization length , a condition that can be fulfilled at low temperature .",
    "@xcite in this limit , the exciton eigenstates @xmath30 form a good basis .",
    "the above picture implies that an aggregate is modeled as a set of independent segments , each of which has its own ground state @xmath31 and an @xmath25-like excited state @xmath32 .",
    "the optical transition between these states is governed by the segment dipole operator @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the transition dipole moment of a monomer .",
    "the corresponding transition dipole moment of a segment is calculated as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the dimensionless transition dipole moment .",
    "the optical dynamics of a segment is described in terms of the @xmath37-density matrix ( @xmath38 ) which obeys the bloch - like equations ( see the appendix )    [ eq : density matrix ] @xmath39",
    "@xmath40 @xmath41    here we set the plank constant @xmath42 and introduced the following notations : @xmath43 is the radiative rate of the exciton state @xmath27 ( @xmath44 being the monomer radiative rate ) , and @xmath45 is the dephasing rate of the state @xmath27 , which includes a pure dephasing term , @xmath46 .",

    "can be considered as scalars .",
    "the amplitude @xmath59 is assumed to vary slowly on the scale of the optical period @xmath60 and wavelength @xmath61 .    we assume without loss of generality that the film is located in the zy plane ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "then the total field at @xmath62 ( inside the film ) is given by  @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the electric polarization of the film ( electric dipole moment per unit volume ) , the dot denotes the time derivative , and @xmath65 stands for speed of light . the second term in the right hand side of eq .",

    "this value for @xmath1 is easily accessible with the spin - coating method  @xcite and guarantees the applicability of the mean - field approach for the description of the thin film optical response .",
    "@xcite the typical width of the j - band of polymethine dyes is on the order of several tens of cm@xmath223 or approximately 1 ps@xmath223 ( in frequency units ) .",
    "@xcite thus , for the set of parameters we chose , the number density of molecules @xmath230 must be on the order of @xmath4 @xmath5 to get the ratio @xmath231 required for bistability to occur .",
    "this concentration is usually achieved in spin - coated films .",
    "another option to adjust the parameters favoring bistability is to consider @xmath16-aggregates composed of monomers with higher radiative constant @xmath44 and a larger emission wavelength @xmath232 . from this point of view",
    ", j - aggregates of squarylium dyes may be suitable candidates .",
    "@xcite this type of aggregates , spin - coated on a substrate , shows a sharp absorption peak at @xmath233 nm with hwhm = 20 nm at room temperature and a fast ( @xmath234 fs ) optical response  @xcite combined with a giant cubic succeptibility ,  @xcite both attributed to the excitonic nature of the optical excitations .",
    "the monomer decay time has been reported to be @xmath234 ps ,  @xcite ) , although no information about the quantum yield has been presented .",
    "if we assume that this time is of radiative nature , the superradiant constant @xmath112 can be adjusted to values above the bistability threshold even for smaller concentration of monomers in the film . on the other hand , for larger @xmath44 also the intensity required for switching increases , which is not desired because of the limited photostability of most j - aggregates .",
    "we theoretically studied the optical response of an ultrathin film of oriented j - aggregates , with the goal to examine the possibility of bistable behavior of the system .",
    "the standard frenkel exciton model was used for a single aggregate : an open linear chain of monomers coupled by delocalizing dipole - dipole excitation transfer interactions , in combination with uncorrelated on - site disorder , which tends to localize the exciton states .",
    "we considered a single aggregate as a meso - ensemble of two - level systems , each one composed of an @xmath25-like localized one - exciton state and its own ground state .",
    "the one - to - two exciton transitions have been neglected .    as a tool to describe the transmission properties of the film , we employed the optical maxwell - bloch equations adapted for a thin film .",
    "the electric polarization of the film was calculated by making use of a joint probability distribution of exciton energies and transition dipole moments , properly taking into account the correlation properties of these two stochastic variables .",
    "the joint distribution function was calculated by numerically diagonalizing the frenkel hamiltonian and averaging over many disorder realizations .",
    "we derived a novel steady - state equation for the transmitted signal in terms of the joint distribution function , and demonstrated that three - valued solutions to this equation exist in a certain domain of the parameter space @xmath160,where @xmath112 is the superradiant constant and @xmath90 is the half - width - at - half - maximum of the absorption band .",
    "our approach allowed us to generalize previous results  @xcite to correctly account for the stochastic nature of the exciton energy and transition dipole moment . using the new steady - state equation , we have found that the critical value of the so - called `` cooperative number '' @xmath231 ,  @xcite which governs the occurrence of bistability of the film , is higher than obtained before .",
    "@xcite moreover , in contrast to refs .   and",
    ", we have analyzed the switching time , which show a dramatic increase for input intensities close to the switching point .",
    "we also found that the `` cooperative number '' @xmath231 increases with @xmath90 , but only slightly , varying between 12 and approximately 25 within a wide range of @xmath90 . estimating the parameters of our model for aggregate of polymethin dyes shows that these are a promising candidate to measure the effect .    finally , we note that also the microcavity arrangement of molecular aggregates  @xcite is of interest for applications . during the last decade ,",
    "organic microcavities have received a great deal of attention because of the strong coupling of the excitons to cavity photons , leading to giant polariton splitting in these devices .",

    "support was also received from nanoned , a national nanotechnology programme coordinated by the dutch ministry of economic affairs .",
    "our approach to the optical dynamics of a single aggregate was based on the representation of the aggregate as a meso - ensemble of two - level systems with their own ground states .",
    "the model has its origin in the fact that the optically dominant exciton states are localized on different segments and overlap weakly . in reality , however , the ground state of an aggregate ( all the monomers are in their ground states ) is common for all ( multi-  ) exciton states .",
    "this results in cross - interference of field - induced as well as spontaneous transitions .",
    "below , we provide estimates of these additional terms and show that in the limit of dominant inhomogeneous broadening of the j - band , the cross - interference effects can be neglected . in our estimates , we will only consider ground state - to - one - exciton transitions .",

    "furthermore , @xmath245 ( @xmath246 ) describes the quantum interference in the radiative relaxation of the @xmath27th and @xmath247th states , resulting from the cross - coupling of different decay channels .",

( [ eq : density matrix ] ) , by several terms .",
    "because all the exciton states have the same ground state , which is reflected in the normalization condition  ( [ rho-00 ] ) , the low - frequency coherences are now involved in the aggregate optical dynamics .",
    "they are coupled to the populations [ eq .  ( [ rho - nunu ] ) ] as well as to the high - frequency ( optical ) coherences @xmath53 [ eqs .",
    "( [ rho - nunu ] ) and  ( [ rho - nu0 ] ) ] via both the cross - coupling of the transitions and the field .",
    "in addition , the cross - coupling also couples the optical coherences @xmath53 [ eq .  ( [ rho - nu0 ] ) ] .    in quantum optics of atomic gases ,",
    "the cross - coupling of transitions has been found to be the origin of many fascinating effects , such as narrow resonances , transparency and gain without population inversion ( see for an overview refs .  ) , as well as bistability at a low threshold .",
    "@xcite all these effects , however , require specific conditions : equivalent magnitudes of all the @xmath256 and the absence of dephasing and inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "any deviation from these requirements washes out those effects .",
    "in particular , this happens for j - aggregates ; below we argue why all the cross - terms in eqs .",
    "( [ density_matrix_equations ] ) can be neglected for these systems .",
    "the contribution of the cross - terms to a given state @xmath27 always comes in the form of a summation over all other states @xmath247 .",
