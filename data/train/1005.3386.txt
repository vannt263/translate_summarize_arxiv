    "the index in the pwn - dominated case is @xmath193 from 0.1 gev to 1 tev ( fig.[g128 ] ) .",
    "the resulting tev @xmath0-ray spectral energy distributions in the two scenarios are all consistent with the hess flux points , so we can not determine which case is preferred by comparison with the detected fluxes in the tev range now .",
    "however , the flux in the gev band in the pwn - dominated case is several times higher than in the snr - dominated case , so future detections in this band can give constraints on the origin of the @xmath0-rays from hess j1813 - 178 .",
    "even if a denser medium with @xmath195 @xmath3 is used in the model to enhance the p - p collisions in the snr shell , the ic scattering of the electrons / positrons in the pwn is still prominent enough to contribute significantly to the high - energy @xmath0-ray emission from the composite snr . in the model",
    ", the pwn evolves in the remnant with an age of @xmath161 yr , and high - energy electrons / positrons are injected continuously into the nebula from the energetic pulsar during the evolution .",
    "in fact , if the emission detected with _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ integral _ is the synchrotron radiation from the electrons / positrons injected in the pwn , the detected vhe @xmath0-rays can be easily explained by the ic scattering of these electrons / positrons off the ambient soft photons .",
    "therefore , it is natural to argue that the observed high - energy photons from the x - ray to vhe @xmath0-ray bands originate mainly from the pwn inside the composite remnant although the contribution of the snr shell to the @xmath0-rays becomes significant for a denser medium with a density of @xmath4 @xmath3 .",
    "the origin of the vhe @xmath0-rays from hess j1813 - 178 is investigated in this paper .",
    "although the source is pointlike in vhe @xmath0-rays , a shell origin of the vhe @xmath0-rays can not be ruled out because the psf of the hess telescope is very close to the size of the snr s shell ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a snr with a diameter of @xmath196 was identified in the radio bands to be associated with the vhe @xmath0-ray source .",
    "moreover , x - ray observations showed a pwn powered by an energetic pulsar is embedded in the snr @xcite , and the pulsar was recently discovered in a long , continuous _ xmm - newton _ x - ray timing observation @xcite .",
    "we apply a model which can self - consistently calculate the multiwavelength nonthermal emission both from the snr shell and from the pwn embedded in the remnant . in the model ,",
    "electrons / positrons with a spectrum of a relativistic maxwellian plus a power - law high - energy tail are injected in the nebula during the pwn during its evolution inside the snr ; protons and electrons are accelerated by the snr shock wave , and the spectrum of the accelerated particles are calculated with a semi - analytical non - linear model .",
    "our results indicate that : with the parameters in table[para ] , ( 1 ) the observed emission of the shell in the radio bands can be well explained as synchrotron radiation of the electrons accelerated by the snr shock wave , whereas the flux of p - p collisions of the accelerated protons is significantly smaller than the tev flux observed with hess ; ( 2 ) the observed emission in the x - ray to hard x - ray band detected with _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ integral _ , respectively , can be explained as the synchrotron radiation of the electrons / positrons injected in the pwn ; ( 3 ) the vhe @xmath0-rays in the tev band are mainly produced via ic scattering of the electrons / positrons injected in the nebula on the cmb and interstellar ir photons .    with a sub - energetic explosion ( @xmath197 erg ) , an age of @xmath161 yr , and an ambient density of @xmath2 @xmath3 , the radius of the composite snr g12.8 - 0.0 , 1.7 pc , as well as the multiband observed nonthermal fluxes for the remnant",
    "can be reproduced within this model described in this paper .",
    "the present value of the snr shock s velocity is about 1000 km s@xmath15 , and the vhe @xmath0-rays are predominately produced from the nebula inside the remnant via ic scattering .",
    "of course , p - p interaction from the snr shell can be enhanced with a denser medium around the remnant ( fig.[figs6 ] ) .",
    "even if this condition were satisfied , the @xmath0-rays produced via ic scattering in the pwn remain significant , hence , in this case , both the snr shell and the pwn would contribute to the production of the observed @xmath0-ray flux . in gev @xmath0-rays ,",
    "the spectral property of the resulting emission in this snr - dominated scenario ( fig.[figs6 ] ) differs significantly from that in the pwn - dominated case ( fig.[g128 ] ) .",
    "the vhe @xmath0-rays of hess j1813 - 178 detected with hess can be naturally explained as the ic scattering of the electrons / positrons injected into the pwn although the p - p collisions become important with a denser ambient medium for the remnant .",
    "our study give more insights on the nature of the multiband nonthermal emission of the composite snr g12.8 - 0.0 , even though some assumptions are made in the model .",
