    "web based deals offering deep discounts to a group of online buyers on products and services is a fast growing market .",
    "group - buying deals attract new customers as well as guarantee customer traffic within a stipulated expiry date for local businesses like restaurants and tour operators  @xcite .",
    "most of these group - buying deals are sold by intermediaries like gropon , groupbuy and many other daily deal providers .",
    "though these intermediaries depended on email based marketing models in the past , banner ads in social networking and other sites are increasingly used to attract deal customers .    unlike the traditional ads ,",
    "group - buying intermediaries receive their payment only upon satisfying the minimum number of conversions before the deal expiry ( i.e. if the deal tips ) .",
    "this implies that if the deal does not tip , advertiser loses the amount used to buy impressions , and receives no payment .",
    "if the advertiser fulfills or exceeds the guarantee , he receives a payment equal to the product of number of conversions and pay per conversions  similar to the traditional ads .",
    "this model is used by popular group - buying advertisers like groupon , and groupbuy among many other deal providers . though most of these deals tips for sites like groupon in current email based marketing , tipping the deals will get harder with increasing competition to attract business owners and shift to the display - ad based marketing .",
    "the proposed strategy enables the deal advertisers to offer more aggressive tipping points , hence more volume of sales to merchants .",
    "further , this model is easy scale to other forms of group - buying campaigns  like penalties for not meeting tipping similar to guaranteed display ads .    to maximize the profits while bidding for group - buy ads , bidders have to minimize cost by bidding low , but still have to win sufficient number of conversions to satisfy guarantees before the deal expiry .",
    "bidding high increases the probability of winning impressions thereby improves the chance of the deal tipping . on the contrary , higher bids increase the payment to the exchange thereby reducing the profit .",
    "hence bids need to be optimized considering these two conflicting pulls .",
    "this maximal profit bidding necessitates dynamic bid optimization based on the time to expiry and the number of received conversions .",
    "we address this problem of maximizing deal bidder profits , by real - time optimization of bids to minimize the cost of impressions while satisfying the deal tipping guarantees . for group - buying deals , the traditional static bidding strategies based on optimization of expected profits of a single impression is far from optimal .",
    "a significant difference from the traditional ads is that the optimal bid value depends on the time to expiry and number of more conversions required to satisfy the guarantees .",
    "for example , consider a deal requiring just a few more conversions to fulfill the guarantee .",
    "if the deal is about to expire the advertiser would have to bid higher amounts to increase the probability of winning more impressions . on the other hand , if the time to expiry is long for the same deal , he would better off bidding smaller amounts winning fewer fraction of impressions to minimize the payment to the exchange ( since there would be higher number of user visits in larger time intervals ) . evidently , the optimum bid amount is a function of the time dependent parameters like the time to expiry and the additional number of conversions needed to satisfy guarantees . due to this time dependence of optimal bids ,",
    "any static bidding strategy will be sub - optimal , necessitating real - time bidding .",
    "fortunately , this dynamic bid optimization is made possible by the advent of ad exchanges offering real - time auctions ( e.g. realmedia , doubleclick , adecn ) .    since the revenue is conditional upon tipping the deal",
    ", the bidding strategies are significantly harder than the traditional non - guaranteed bidding .",
    "in addition to the dynamic quantities mentioned above , deal profit depends on a number of static quantities : pay per event , number and bid distributions of other bidders , conversion rates , and the auction mechanism  @xcite .",
    "consequently , formulating and maximizing expected profits  which is a function of all these static and dynamic quantities  is significantly harder . adding to the complexity , the optimization is online necessitating low computation timings .    our method of optimizing profit for guaranteed deals has two steps : ( i ) formulating the expected profit ( ii ) maximizing the profit against the bid .",
    "for the first step , we derive the expected profit as a function of the bid value , time to expiry , fulfilled conversions , amount spent to buy impressions , auction mechanism , click through rate and the number and distribution of the other bidders . since many of these parameters are dynamic as described above , the objective function value changes as the bidding progresses .",
    "among all these parameters , the only parameter the bidder can change is his own bid amount .",
    "hence we optimize the expected profit against the bid amount in the second step .",
    "when the profits are optimum , the deal bids are in a symmetric bayesian nash equilibrium similar to the traditional ads  @xcite .    considering the complexity of the optimization , a closed form solution is unlikely .",
    "though the optimization is against a single variable ( i.e. bid amount ) , our analysis shows that the objective function is neither convex nor quasi - convex ( unimodal ) .",
    "consequently , an optimization method guaranteed to converge to optimal bids on every instance is unlikely .",
    "further , the derivative of the objective function is harder to solve than the objective itself .",
    "considering these factors , we resort to direct numerical optimization ( without using gradients ) starting from multiple points .    *",
    "running time minimization : * since the optimization is online , computation time needs to be minimized .",
    "therefore we explore running time optimization in multiple levels .",
    "firstly , we use a fast converging brent s optimizer .",
    "secondly , we reformulate the objective for faster computation for typical parameter values .",
    "further , we approximate large binomial cumulative probability expressions with a single term normal approximation .",
    "since the changes in the optimal bids for subsequent impressions are incremental , we reuse optimal bid values of previous impressions whenever changes are likely to be negligible .",
    "* extensions : * interestingly , the solutions of many related problems can be directly derived from the proposed objective function .",
    "we describe the four proposed extensions below :    ( i ) deal selection : :    deal selection chooses the best deals to bid to maximize the bidder    profits . combining optimal bidding and selection",
    ", we derive the    bidders private value and the marginal profit increase for the    impression for each deal .",
    "the deal with the highest marginal profit    increase is the greedy optimal selection .",
    "( ii ) deal admissibility : :    admissibility is the problem of predicting whether bidding for a    group - buying deal is likely to be profitable based on its attributes .    the intermediary or the advertiser may decide to accept or reject a    deal campaign based on admissibility criterion . we show that a special    case of our objective function combined with the bid optimization    provides effective admission control . (",
    "iii ) non - bidding selection : :    for non - bidding scenarios like the publisher directly selecting the    deals to display , the proposed formulation suggests optimal selection    among the inventory of deals .",
    "( iv ) non - guaranteed ads : :    we show that the real time bid optimization of traditional    non - guaranteed ads is a special case of the proposed optimization .",
    "when there are no guarantees , the proposed objective function reduces    to expected profits of traditional ads , yielding known optimal static    bid formulations .",
    "thus the method serves as a unified real time    bidding strategy for both guaranteed and non - guaranteed ads .",
    "* evaluations and results : * we evaluate the proposed methods and the extensions in a query log of size 9.3 million impressions of 935 ads . in our first set of experiments ,",
    "we compare our profits of the proposed real time strategy with the optimal static and base adaptive baselines .",
    "the results show that the proposed strategy improves the profits over the baselines significantly .",
    "subsequently , experiments showing improved profits in spite of violated assumptions of the competitor bids demonstrate robustness of the strategy .",
    "further , our running time evaluations demonstrate acceptable optimization timings .",
    "finally , our evaluations of the ad selection and admissibility demonstrate that the extensions improve profits significantly over the baselines .",
    "rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section discusses related work , followed by section on notations and the formal problem definition .",
    "section  [ sec - maximizingprofit ] derives the expected profits and proposes the optimization method .",
    "subsequently , we discuss running time minimizations .",

    "@xcite addressed the problem of optimal selection of guaranteed ( group buying ) ads .",
    "our work is different , since we deal with optimal bidding , whereas grabchak _",

    "the optimal bidding problem of group - buy deals and the extensions have not been addressed .",
    "every group - buy deal @xmath0 has a required minimum clicks @xmath1 , an expiry time @xmath2 , a cost per click ( cpc ) @xmath3 , and a click through rate ( ctr ) @xmath4 .",
    "thus a deal may be represented as , @xmath5    for the rest of the paper our discussions are based on guaranteed number of clicks for the ease of description .",
    "the discussions and results are equally applicable for guaranteed conversions ( refer to section  [ sec - gnerelizations ] for the details ) ( by substituting conversion rates ( cvr ) for click through rates and click per action ( cpa ) for cpc ) and guaranteed displays ( by setting click through rate to one and substituting cost per impression ( cpi ) for ctr ) .",

    "the time @xmath8 denotes @xmath8 user visits ( impression opportunities ) rather than wall clock time . for a deal",
    "@xmath0 the profit @xmath10 at time @xmath8 is , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a mapping from bids to the payment whose closed form depends on the auction model , the number of other bidders and the bid distributions . for",
    "the commonly used first price auction for display ads @xmath13 . for other auctions like second price auction",
    ", closed forms can be derived based on order statistics  @xcite . after fulfilling guarantees",
    "( i.e. @xmath14 ) the expected profit function for the guaranteed deals are the same as that of the traditional non - guaranteed ads .",
    "hence , the period of interest for our analysis and experiments is the time before guarantees are fulfilled .    to maximize the profit in equation  [ eqn - profitforumuation ] ,",
    "the only parameter decided by the bidder is the bid amount .",
    "hence we may state the profit maximization problem as ,    * bidding problem : * _ given a guaranteed ad @xmath15 , and number of received conversions @xmath9 , find the bid amount @xmath16 such that the expected profit from @xmath17 user visits is maximal , where @xmath17 is the expected number of user visits before the ad expiry time @xmath2 . _",
    "to explain the nature of the problem , we start by finding the optimal bid based on the expected values of parameters at @xmath18 .",
    "this is the best possible estimate at that point of time .",
    "as time progresses , we will get better estimates of parameters based on the actual values of number of conversions , and user visits so far .",
    "hence we keep updating the optimal bid @xmath16 based on the current state and expected numbers in the future .",
    "we assume that @xmath17 is known , as it can be generally estimated from the traffic statistics  @xcite .",
    "we derive the expected profits of group - buy deal campaigns based on the current state of the deal .",
    "subsequently we analyze the nature of the the profit - function , and present a method to maximize the profits in real - time by bid adjustments .",
    "the click probability of a deal is , @xmath19 the first factor @xmath20 is equal to the ctr of the deal  is a constant for static auctions considered here . the second factor  probability of winning impression @xmath21is an increasing function of the bid amount .",
    "this implies that the probability of satisfying click guarantees , and consequently the expected profit increase with the bid amount . on the contrary ,",
    "the amount paid by the bidder to the publisher ( @xmath12 ) is an increasing function of the bid amount .",
    "hence the profit tends to decrease with increasing bid amount .",
    "the bids need to be optimized considering these two conflicting effects on the profit .    for real - time bidding , different advertisers or intermediaries place bids for a given ad impression .",
    "generally the highest bidder wins , and will display his ad . in general bid values of a bidder varies , either due to the bidder s private value distribution , or due to a deliberate randomization done by the bidder to avoid giving advantage to the competition  @xcite .",
    "hence , the event of winning is probabilistic , with a binary outcome .",
    "further , winning in consecutive bids can be assumed to be independent of each other . hence bidding to win impressions are bernoulli trials with success probability increasing with the bid amount .",
    "the users click with probabilities equal to the estimated ctr of the winning ad .",
    "this is again a bernoulli trial with success probability equal to the ctr .",
    "hence these two trials  bidding and getting conversions  may be combined as a single bernoulli trial of bidding to win clicks .",
    "the probability of success for this composite trial is equal to the product of ctr and probability of winning an impression . for composite bernoulli trial described above",
    ", the number of successes follows a binomial distribution .",
    "to facilitate representing such a binomial distribution , we introduce the following two functions , @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath4 is the ctr of the ad , and @xmath24 is the additional number of clicks required to satisfy the guarantees .    function @xmath25 is a mapping from the bid value to the probability of winning the impression . for a sealed bid auction",
    "in which the highest bid wins ( e.g. first or second price auctions ) , this probability is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the cumulative probability distribution of the bids of other bidders , and @xmath28 is the total number of bidders . to get a closed form of @xmath25 we need to assume a distribution function of bids .",
    "for example , if the bids are uniformly distributed between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "similar closed forms can be derived for other distributions , and even for cases where different competitors following different distributions  @xcite .    at optimal profits ,",
    "the bids are the best responses to competitors and hence are in a symmetric bayesian - nash equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "consequently , we may limit our analysis to truthful bidding without the loss of generality as stated by the revelation principle  @xcite .",
    "hence the assumptions on bid distributions above are equivalent to the same assumptions on private value distributions of bidders at the optimal profit outcomes .    now the net expected profits is given by the objective function , @xmath32 please refer to appendix  [ appendix - secexpectedprofitderivation ] for the derivation of the expected profits .",
    "the expected profit in equation  [ eqn - expectedprofitsingledeal ] has to be optimized with respect to the bid amount .",
    "an option is to differentiate the function with respect to @xmath16 and solve the derivative for zero .",
    "but this is hard since the derivative may have large number of terms , and solving the derivative will be harder than a direct approach .",
    "hence a direct optimization of the objective function  as we do below  is faster .",
    "an example curve of variation of the objective function with bids is shown in figure  [ fig - objectivenonconvex ] .",
    "two observations significant to the numerical optimization are ( i ) the optimization is non - convex .",
    "( ii ) the function is not even quasi - convex ( unimodal ) .",
    "this implies that a bisection or gradient descent method may get trapped in a local optimum , and hence the convergence to the global optima is not guaranteed .",
    "consequently , we need to start the optimization from multiple points making the problem harder .    for the bidding process",
    ", the winning probability is one if the bid is greater than the maximum bid of the competitors bid distribution ; and zero for bids less than the minimum bids . hence the optimal values will always be between the maximum and minimum even without imposing external constraints .",
    "this allows a simpler unconstrained optimization .",
    "the optimizer restarts the search from multiple random starting points to avoid local minima traps ( the details of the restarts are discussed in the section  [ subsec - minimizingrunning ] ) .",
    "further since the optimization is online , fast - convergence is highly desirable . considering these factors , we adapt brent s optimization method .",
    "brent s optimization combines parabolic interpolation with golden ratio search for faster convergence .",
    "if the parabolic interpolation fails , the search falls back to the golden ratio search .    , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and single competitor with uniform random bid in @xmath36 $ ] ( i ) exact binomial for @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "( ii ) normal approximation for @xmath39 , @xmath40.,width=264,height=207 ]",
    "the optimization of the bids has to be performed online between the impression opportunities . evaluating objective function in equation  [ eqn - expectedprofitsingledeal ]",
    "directly may involve computing hundreds of thousands of terms . since the time duration between the impression opportunities can be very small",
    ", the optimization time must be within acceptable limits .",
    "in addition to using fast converging brent s optimizer , we adopt several approximations and computational methods for improved running time .    * reducing number of terms : * typically for deals the user visits needed to get the required number of clicks are very large compared to the clicks needed for tipping the deal .",
    "i.e. @xmath41 ; except for a last few user visits before deal expiry . exploiting this ,",
    "we reduce the computation time by rewriting the equations [ eqn - phiexpression ] and [ eqn - thetaexpression ] as , @xmath42 @xmath43 this rewriting may reduce computations from hundreds of thousands of terms to less than a few hundred terms .    *",
    "normal approximation : * in spite of replacing @xmath17 by @xmath24 , computing binomial cdfs in equation [ eqn - phiexpressiontuned ] and [ eqn - thetaexpressiontuned ] may involve summation of hundreds of combinatorial terms . the binomial cdf may be approximated by a single term normal cdf for large values of @xmath17 ( central limit theorem ) . exploiting this , we compute @xmath44 and @xmath45 based on a normal cdf with correction for continuity .",
    "i.e. @xmath46 there is no analytical solution for this integral , but can be looked up from a normal cdf table or can be approximated by finite analytical forms .",
    "similarly , approximating the standardized form of @xmath45 as @xmath47 , @xmath48 where @xmath49    @xmath50    for small @xmath17 and @xmath24 , normal approximation may diverge more from the original binomial function , and computation of the binomial is less costly .",
    "hence it is more accurate to use actual binomial distribution for smaller @xmath24 and @xmath17 .",
    "we depend on the common rule of thumb for approximating binomial cdf by normal cdf , i.e. if @xmath51 we use normal approximation .    considering the optimization of the normal approximation ,",
    "the sample graph of the objective function with the approximations is shown in figure  [ fig - objectivenonconvex ] . like the original binomial objective , the normal approximation is neither convex nor quasi - convex .",
    "consequently optimizing the approximation faces the same difficulties as the optimization of the original objective .    *",
    "setting the starting points : * the optimal bid values generally change only nominally for subsequent impressions of a deal .",
    "exploiting this fact , the optimal bid for an impression is used as the starting point for optimization for the next impression .",
    "this reusing of optimal bids expedite convergence .",
    "* multiple starting points : * the non - convexity of the objective requires the optimal value search to start from multiple points . as optimal bids change only incrementally for successive impressions of a deal , we avoid restart from multiple points for every impression . for this  instead of starting from previous optimal values as described above  we chose random starting points for optimization for the first twenty impressions .",
    "the bid corresponding to the maximum objective value among these searches is used as the optimal value .",
    "this strategy is found to be converging to optimal values for all the deals we tested .    *",
    "re - computation frequency : * as the change in optimal bids are nominal for subsequent impression opportunities , the previous bids can be reused .",
    "hence we re - optimize bids only after a number of impression opportunities ( every thirty two impression opportunities in our experiments ) .",
    "further , optimal value is always recomputed if there is a click , since one more clicks may cause a non - trivial changes in the optimal bid .",
    "the optimal bidding for group - by deals is a general problem , which on specific assumptions reduces to number of related use - cases . as a corollary",
    ", the proposed solution reduces to solutions of these problems on the same assumptions . in figure  [ fig - objecviereductions ]",
    "we enumerate these extensions and assumptions on which the guaranteed bidding will reduce to these problems .",
    "considering three downward branches in figure  [ fig - objecviereductions ] , the guaranteed bidding easily transform to guaranteed clicks , displays and conversions .",
    "for example by setting @xmath52 the deal definition in equation  [ eqn - dealdefinition ] will define a guaranteed conversion campaign .",
    "consequently , on the same assumption the profit formulation in equation  [ eqn - expectedprofitsingledeal ] gives guaranteed click campaign profits .",
    "similarly , by setting @xmath4 equal to 1 and cvr , the problem and the solution will be applicable for guaranteed impressions and conversions deals respectively .",
    "four upward branches in figure  [ fig - objecviereductions ] illustrate reductions to related bidding and selection problems . we discuss them in the sections below and",
    "the the deal related extensions are evaluated separately in sections  [ subsec - selectingdealsexpt ] and  [ subsec - admissibilitydealsexpt ] .",
    "deal selection is the problem of maximizing expected profits by choosing the best deal to bid for every impression . considering the online nature of the problem",
    ", we perform a greedy deal selection .",
    "the deal with the maximum marginal profit by the impression is selected as the winner . expected marginal profit is calculated as the difference between the expected profits of winning the impression and failing to win the impression . adding the bid amount to marginal profit to derive the marginal revenue as ,    @xmath53    \\label{eqn - expectedtruevalue }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "derivation of the equation is given in appendix  [ appendix - secprivatevaluederivation ] .",
    "this marginal revenue is the expected private value of the impression for the deal bidder , isomorphic to the private value of the traditional ads .",
    "similar to the traditional ads , @xmath54 gives the expected profit by displaying deal @xmath55 at time @xmath8 .    to select a deal",
    ", the bid values of deals are optimized against the expected profits as described in section  [ sec - maximizingprofit ] .",
    "these optimal bids are substituted in equation  [ eqn - expectedtruevalue ] to calculate the private values .",
    "the deal with the highest increase in the expected profit is selected for bidding .",
    "we evaluate the proposed selection in section  [ subsec - selectingdealsexpt ] .",
    "selection considering deals groups is a harder combinatorial optimization problem , and we leave this for future research .",
    "admissibility criterion decides if the profit from a deal is likely to be positive .",
    "admissibility can be directly derived as a special case of optimal bidding .",
    "more specifically , if the maximal expected profit from an deal is positive at @xmath18 the ad is admissible . at @xmath18",
    "the equation  [ eqn - expectedprofitsingledeal ] reduces to , @xmath56 where @xmath2 is the expected number of visits before the deal expiry . to evaluate admissibility ,",
    "bids are optimized for maximal profits and substituted in equation  [ eqn - admissibility ] .",
    "if the expected profits are positive , we consider the deal as admissible .",
    "the profit increase from admissibility is evaluated in section  [ subsec - admissibilitydealsexpt ] .      if there are no competing bidders  i.e .",
    "number of bidders is equal to one  the problem will reduce to that of selection from competing deals . alternatively",
    ", this scenario may be thought of as the publisher selecting deals directly . in this case @xmath57 in selection equation  [ eqn - expectedtruevalue ] for all values of @xmath16 . since",
    "this is a special case of the selection with bidding , we do not include separate evaluations , as results are directly implied . alternatively , since there is no bidding involved , selection may be modeled as an offline problem . in this case ,",
    "selection of deal sets for maximization profits of deal combinations may be of interest .",
    "we leave this optimal offline selection of deal sets for future research .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig - objecviereductions ] , when the minimum click guarantee is zero , the guaranteed deal bidding reduces to the bidding of tradition non - guaranteed ads .",
    "consequently , the expected profits for non - guaranteed ads may obtained by substituting @xmath58 in equation  [ eqn - expectedprofitsingledeal ] as , @xmath59 considering the profit from a single impression ( i.e. @xmath60 ) , thereby ignoring the constants terms of past profits , the expected profit becomes , @xmath61 .",
    "this expected profits can be maximized with respect to the bid values .",
    "for example , for a first price auction with @xmath28 bidders and competitors having a bid distribution with cumulative distribution function of @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "note that the expected profits , hence the optimal bids , derived above is the same as the existing formulations of optimal static bid profits of traditional ads  @xcite .",
    "this is a manifestation of the broader fact that the existing bidding formulations are optimal for static environments .",
    "hence the optimal real time bids will essentially be the same .",
    "in other words , the real - time bidding provides no advantage over static bidding for non - guaranteed ads in static environments . on the other hand",
    ", the real - time bidding would improve profits over existing bidding for dynamic environments  @xcite .",
    "thus the proposed bidding provides a strategy to account for the dynamism in parameters of traditional ads  like the changed estimates of click - through rate or competitor bid distributions .",
    "we compared the profits by the proposed bidding strategy with baseline strategies of ( i ) optimal static bidding ( ii ) a basic real time bidding .",
    "we evaluated the profit increase , running time , deal selection and admissibility  including the robustness of our method to violation of assumptions .",
    "* data set : * from a click log of 330 million impressions , we randomly selected 935 ads ( with 9.3 million impressions ) having a minimum of 5 clicks and 1000 impressions .",
    "click log contains impressions and whether the impression resulted in a click or not .",
    "* baseline bidders : * first baseline bidder is an optimal static bidder .",
    "the bidder derives optimal bids as a function of number of competitors and their bid distributions  @xcite , and is optimal if there are no guarantees .",
    "the second baseline bidder is a basic adaptive bidder , which bids as @xmath65 .",
    "the strategy is intuitive , as it increases bid over the static optimal bid if the required click rate is greater than the ctr and decreases the bids otherwise .",
    "we also used the profits by a placing a random bid as a baseline in our initial experiments .",
    "random bidding performed much worse than all of the above baselines and is not plotted in the results .      to compare the profits by bidders , the proposed real - time ( rt ) and baseline bidders compete with random bidders for every ad in the  replayed \" click log .",
    "for example , the rt bidder places its bid for the first impression of an ad , along with the competing random bidders .",
    "if the rt bidders bid is the highest , the bidder wins the impression .",
    "the deal wins a click if the click log indicates a click for that impression .",
    "then the same process repeats for the second impression and so on .",
    "similarly , other baseline bidders are made to compete with the same random bidders for the same set of ads , and the realized profits are compared .",
    "this replaying reproduces online experiment , since the user action in the consecutive impressions are most likely from different users , and hence independent .",
    "the experiments are repeated by changing every significant parameter ",
    "one at a time  to analyze the effects of different parameters .",
    "since the click logs are of traditional ads having no required clicks or expiry , we set the expiry timings as the number of impressions of the ad in the log . to compensate for using the traditional ads instead of deals ,",
    "the required clicks are varied by a parameter sweep over the plausible range .",
    "we do not vary expiry time , since the ratio of required clicks to the expiry time determines the profit  rather than the expiry time alone  and this ratio varies as we do a parameter sweep on required clicks .",
