    "a chain of coupled oscillators is a universal mathematical model that describes a large variety of phenomena in physics , chemistry , biology and other sciences .",
    "examples include energy localization and propagation,@xcite discrete solitons,@xcite chemical reactions,@xcite nonequilibrium phase transitions,@xcite stochastic resonance,@xcite synchronization,@xcite brain dynamics@xcite and many others .",
    "a special case of that model , a chain of charged particles that interact via the coulomb interaction , also has a variety of applications .",
    "in particular , if the charges have the same sign and are confined by a trapping potential , it describes the so - called one - dimensional coulomb crystals , i.e. , a crystallized structure of ions in a linear trap formed by external focusing fields.@xcite if neighboring charges have opposite signs and a repulsive interaction exists between particles , then a such chain represents a relevant model for one - dimensional ionic crystals .",
    "it seems that those models can be useful also for the study of one - dimensional crystals within carbon nanotubes.@xcite    during the last decade , much attention was devoted to the transport properties of particles in thermal ratchets , i.e. , spatially periodic stochastic models exhibiting noise - induced macroscopic transport .",
    "the ratchet effect or stochastic transport in asymmetric potentials is important for biological motors,@xcite separation techniques,@xcite surface smoothing@xcite and vortex density reduction,@xcite to name a few .",
    "most studies of ratchets , including deterministic ones,@xcite i.e. , ratchets without internal and external noises , have been performed for a _ single _ particle .",
    "however , examples of coupled particles@xcite and vortices@xcite show that their _ collective _ interactions can significantly modify the transport properties from the single particle case .",
    "to our knowledge , the transport properties of a chain of strongly coupled charged particles in deterministic ratchets have not been studied at all .    in this paper",
    ", we study the equilibrium , oscillatory and transport properties of a chain where the neighboring particles have the same mass and opposite charges .",
    "particles interact with each other via both the coulomb interaction and a repulsive interaction that depends on the interparticle distance as @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the coordinate of the @xmath2th particle , @xmath3 ) . in sec .",
    "ii , we consider the ground state of such a chain depending on the exponent @xmath4 .",
    "three different states of a chain , namely , a periodic chain with equidistant particles , a periodic chain with non - equidistant particles , and a chain with infinite period , are analyzed , and the interparticle distances and the chain energies as functions of @xmath4 are calculated .",
    "in contrast to intuitive expectations , we show that there is a critical value of the exponent , @xmath5 , such that for @xmath6 the minimum energy occurs for a chain with equidistant particles , and for @xmath7 the minimum energy occurs for a chain with infinite period .",
    "propagation of longitudinal waves in a chain with equidistant particles , its stability with respect to small displacement of particles from their equilibrium positions , and forced vibrations of particles under action of an alternating electric field are studied in sec .",
    "we derive the set of equations that describe small oscillations of the particles , find the phonon spectrum and its asymptotics near the center and boundary of the brillouin zone , and calculate the amplitude of forced vibrations .",
    "we show that the spectrum consists of one branch ; on the boundary of the brillouin zone it has a non - analyticity which is caused by the long - range action of the coulomb interaction , and a chain is stable only if @xmath8 .    the deterministic transport of a chain is studied in sec .",
    "we consider the case when the ratchet potential is charge independent , and a chain is driven by a longitudinal alternating electric field .",
    "we find the average velocity of a chain and analyze in detail its dependence on the parameters characterizing the interparticle interactions , ratchet potential and alternating electric field .",
