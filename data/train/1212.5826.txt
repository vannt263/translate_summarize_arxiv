    "in this paper we consider the following second order differential equation @xmath0 with suitably chosen functions @xmath1 to be defined below by ( [ albe ] ) and some constants @xmath2 to be determined later and suitable initial or boundary conditions derived from some model describing the motion of the rocket , cf .",
    "specifically , it can be derived from the one - dimensional first oder differential equation @xmath3 this equation can be used to model a rocket motion with decreasing mass @xmath4 and under external force @xmath5 .",
    "the rocket should be equipped with the engine that emits mass @xmath6 with velocities @xmath7 @xmath8   .\\,$]therefore , the difference between the mass of the rocket @xmath9 and the mass of the gas emitted at time @xmath10 is constant and equal @xmath11 which is some positive value , i.e. @xmath12 . in @xmath11",
    "we include all components of the rocket infrastructure like the engine , empty tank , guidance equipment , payload and the like .",
    "the function @xmath13 denotes all external forces that stimulate the rocket motion for example the gravity force or the drag force and in fact may depend also on the position and the velocity of the rocket , cf .",
    "( [ fex ] )    the expression @xmath14 is the force acting on the rocket body which is given by the amount of mass expelled and the velocity of the mass relative to the rocket body , i.e. @xmath15 . the rocket moves forward since the rocket loses mass as it accelerates , so @xmath16 must be negative for any rocket .",
    "the term @xmath17 is called the thrust of the rocket and can be interpreted as an additional force on the rocket due to the gas expulsion .",
    "the detailed derivation of the rocket equation one can find , among others , in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite.the equation @xmath18 is so called the meerskii rocket equation , for details see @xcite , @xcite , where alos the case of more that just one emitted mass was considered .",
    "if we assume , the external force to be zero and a constant relative velocity of the emitted mass , i.e. @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21   $ ] , then the equation @xmath18 has the form of the well - known tsiolkovskii rocket equation .",
    "the corresponding solution to the tsiolkovskii equation with the initial conditions @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be easily found after integration of @xmath18 and reads as follows@xmath24 the tsiolkovskii rocket equation in the gravitational field , i.e. @xmath25 with the initial conditions @xmath26 and @xmath27has a solution of the form@xmath28 assume that @xmath29 with @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a drag coefficient , @xmath32 is the cross sectional area of the rocket , @xmath33 is the air density that changes with altitude @xmath34 and can be approximated by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the so called `` scale height '' of the atmosphere , and finally @xmath37 is the air density at sea level .",
    "in that case it is impossible to solve the equation explicitly .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the effect of drag loss is usually quite small and is often reasonable to ignore it in the first approach . in practice ,",
    "the drag force is approximately only about 2% of the gravity force .",
    "except for the rocket equation , the tsiolkovskii equation can also be applied to the one photon decay of the excited nucleus . moreover ,",
    "it is possible to identify the meerskii equation with the bremsstrahlung equation where the electron is in the permanent decay .",
    "many other decays can be investigated from the point of view of the meerskii equation , as one can see in @xcite .    in the paper",
    "we will consider the equation @xmath38 with a given relative velocity of emitted masses @xmath39 for any @xmath40 and @xmath21   .$ ] chemical rockets produce exhaust jets at velocities @xmath41 from @xmath42 @xmath43 to @xmath44 @xmath45    if we assume that the relative velocity is a given function @xmath46 we obtain the following equation@xmath47 let us put @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes rocket position at time @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the external force depends not only on time @xmath10 but also on the rocket position @xmath50 and its velocity @xmath51 according to gravitational and drag forces , i.e. @xmath52 such that @xmath53   \\times\\mathbb{r}\\times\\mathbb{r}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}$].therefore , we get the equation @xmath54 for any @xmath8   .$]we provide our equation @xmath55 with the boundary conditions@xmath56 which guarantee that the rocket attains the given point in the required period of time .",
    "after a shift @xmath57 by a linear function@xmath58 where @xmath59 and equation @xmath55 reads @xmath60 for any @xmath8   $ ] and @xmath61 satisfies the homogenous dirichlet boundary conditions@xmath62 consequently , one can reduce considered equation to a aforementioned form@xmath0 where@xmath63",
    "it should be noted that due to the presence of the derivative @xmath64 the equation @xmath65 is not in a variational form .",
    "therefore our approach differs from the one employed in @xcite ( for extension to elliptic problems see @xcite ) and makes use of integral formulation approach .",
    "specifically the boundary value problem @xmath66 with @xmath67 can be reformulated in the following way@xmath68 where the nonlinear term @xmath69 is defined as @xmath70 with the abuse of notation , namely @xmath64 denotes in the above formula the third independent variable and the function @xmath71 is defined by@xmath72 recall that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are defined by formulas @xmath75 the function @xmath76 is the green function , i.e. the continuous symmetric function satisfying the following conditions .    1 .   the homogeneous equation , i.e. for any @xmath77@xmath78 2 .   the boundary conditions , i.e. for any @xmath79 $ ] @xmath80 3",

    "indeed , for any @xmath95 the function @xmath98 is continuous since the functions appearing under the integral sign @xmath99 are uniformly continuous and @xmath100 is also continuous by the integrability of @xmath101 cf .",

    "we provide crude but immediate estimates yielding by the schauder fixed point theorem the existence of a fixed point for the operator @xmath104 to this end we start with simple estimates of the following sup norms @xmath105@xmath106 where @xmath107   } { \\displaystyle\\int\\limits_{t_{0}}^{t_{1 } } } g\\left (   t , s\\right )   ds,\\\\ g_{1 } &   = \\sup_{t\\in\\left [   t_{0},t_{1}\\right ]   } { \\displaystyle\\int\\limits_{t_{0}}^{t_{1 } } } \\left|\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t}\\left (   t , s\\right ) \\right| ds.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using formula @xmath108 one can easily derive the value of @xmath109 and @xmath110      as announced we will make use of the schauder fixed point theorem for the operator @xmath97.defined by @xmath114 we should prove that it maps some ball @xmath115 in @xmath116 into itself . using the preliminary estimates",
    "@xmath117 and defining @xmath118 the invariance of the ball @xmath115 under the action of @xmath97 can be reduced to the following condition@xmath119 which can be satisfied by some @xmath120 if @xmath121 i.e. @xmath122 and the value in the nominator is positive which is guaranteed provided @xmath123",
    "if @xmath125 i.e. we neglect the drag force , accounting for negligable , in real world model , part , our assumptions are naturally satisfied .",
    "in such a context it is natural that one can attain the destination point in the desired period of time .",
    "in fact since the equation is linear one can derive the explicit formula for the solution .",
    "in this section we provide more subtle a priori estimates taking into regard the negative sign of some terms appearing in @xmath126 and instead of using schauder theorem , we apply more subtle schafer theorem .",
    "first , we neglect negative term in ( [ bvp ] ) and integrate inequality @xmath127 using boundary conditions .",
    "thus we get by ( [ tso ] ) the bound for @xmath128 and hence for @xmath61 .",
    "next we multiply by @xmath64 both sides of ( [ bvp ] ) and integrate after dividing by @xmath129 ... to get better a priori bounds ."
