    "in recent years , the formation and properties of bipolarons , consisting of two electrons forming a pair in real space , have received considerable interest due to their potential role , e.g. , in high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "theories based on bipolaron formation have been proposed for the superconducting transition in the cuprates,@xcite and the metal - insulator transition and colossal magnetoresistance in the manganites.@xcite despite some fundamental problems,@xcite they are still issue of ongoing discussion .",
    "many interesting materials fall into the adiabatic regime of small but finite phonon frequencies and intermediate to strong electron - phonon coupling . for such parameters , analytical approaches based on , e.g. ,",

    "in contrast , computational methods represent a very powerful instrument to obtain exact , unbiased information , and a lot of numerical work has recently been devoted to an understanding of the holstein and the holstein - hubbard ( hh ) model .    in this paper , we present a simple but surprisingly accurate variational approach to the hh bipolaron .",
    "more importantly , we extend a recently developed quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method@xcite to the case of two electrons of opposite spin . the resulting algorithm is used to study bipolaron formation in the one - dimensional hh model , focusing on the adiabatic regime . while the ground - state properties of the hh bipolaron are rather well understood",
    ", here we exploit the capability of the qmc approach to also study finite temperatures .",
    "we find that , in particular , the weakly bound intersite bipolaron is susceptible to thermal dissociation .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to previous studies , we are able to consider a very large range of the electron - phonon and electron - electron interaction .    the outline of this work is as follows . in sec .  [",

    "the hh model is defined in terms of dimensionless phonon by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 describes the hopping of electrons , @xmath2 corresponds to the sum of the kinetic ( @xmath3 ) and elastic ( @xmath4 ) energy of the phonons , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 denote the electron - phonon ( el - ph ) and electron - electron ( el - el ) interaction terms , respectively . here",

    "the third term , @xmath5 , describes the coupling of dispersionless einstein phonons to the electron occupation number @xmath15 . for doped cuprates or manganites ,",
    "such a local interaction is expected to be a reasonable approximation as a result of screening . in the first term",
    ", the symbol @xmath16 denotes a summation over all nearest - neighbor hopping pairs @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the parameters of the model are the hopping integral @xmath19 , the phonon energy @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , the el - ph coupling constant @xmath22 , and the coulomb repulsion @xmath23 . for @xmath24 , eq .  ( [ eq : holstein ] ) is identical to the holstein model.@xcite as in previous work , we introduce the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the bare bandwidth in d dimensions .",
    "we further define the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and express all energies in units of @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , the independent parameters of the model are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "we shall see below that a very useful quantity is given by the polaron binding energy @xmath32 .",
    "finally , throughout this paper , periodic boundary conditions in real space are assumed .",
    "this work is exclusively concerned with the case of two electrons , neglecting the interaction between bipolarons which will definitely be present to some degree in real materials .",
    "furthermore , we restrict our attention to two electrons with opposite spin , i.e. , to the singlet bipolaron . a comparison of the singlet and triplet state has recently been given in ref .  .",
    "a review of early work on the bipolaron problem can be found in the book of alexandrov and mott.@xcite here we focus the discussion on more recent developments .",
    "the latter can roughly be divided into two classes depending on the methods employed : ( a ) variational approaches,@xcite and ( b ) unbiased numerical studies using ed,@xcite variational diagonalization,@xcite the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg),@xcite and qmc.@xcite except for the qmc study of de raedt and lagendijk,@xcite all work was restricted to the ground state . moreover , even their qmc results were reported only for a single , low temperature .",
    "this motivates our study of temperature effects in sec .",

    "are only weakly influenced by finite - size effects .",
    "an important disadvantage of ed and dmrg is the fact that the phonon hilbert space has to be truncated , so that these methods can not easily be used to study the adiabatic ( @xmath33 ) and/or strong - coupling ( @xmath34 ) regime . in contrast , no such limitations are imposed on qmc and most variational methods .",
    "although de raedt and lagendijk only considered the adiabatic limit @xmath35 , similar to other authors,@xcite their method can also be applied for finite phonon frequency.@xcite moreover , it may be generalized to include dispersive phonons .",
    "recently , an extended holstein model with long - range el - ph interaction has been investigated by bona and trugman.@xcite de raedt and lagendijk also considered long - range coulomb interaction , while most other authors only took into account the local hubbard - type interaction given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : holstein ] ) , except for zhang et al.@xcite who have omitted this term in their dmrg calculations .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that bipolaron formation in a model with jahn - teller modes  as present in the perovskite manganites  has been studied by shawish et al.@xcite",
    "the basis of both the variational approach and the qmc method presented below is the unitary transformation @xmath36 of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : holstein ] ) , with @xmath37 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "the result is @xmath38 with @xmath39 as discussed in ref .",
    ", henceforth also referred to as i , the extended transformation @xmath40 takes into account nonlocal lattice displacements , which are essential for a correct description in the regime @xmath41 .",
    "similar to i , for the qmc method , we resort to the standard lang - firsov ( lf ) transformation@xcite with @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 has been chosen such that the el - ph coupling term @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : holstein ] ) cancels .",
    "the transformed hamiltonian then takes the form @xmath44 hence , in contrast to the polaron problem,@xcite the el - el interaction term , resulting from the canonical transformation , does not vanish but instead combines with the hubbard term .",
    "the derivation of the qmc algorithm for the bipolaron problem is very similar to the one - electron case,@xcite and we shall therefore focus on the differences occurring . moreover , we restrict the discussion to one dimension .",
    "we set out to calculate the partition function @xmath45 , with @xmath46 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfhamiltonian ] ) . to this end",

    "we begin with the contribution of the kinetic term @xmath61 [ eq .  ( [ eq : lfhamiltonian ] ) ] .",
    "it follows that the tight - binding hopping matrix , denoted as @xmath74 , has dimension @xmath75 .",
    "the exponential of the transformed hopping term can be written as@xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is diagonal in the basis  ( [ eq : basis ] ) .",
    "the second contribution to the matrix @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) comes from the effective el - el interaction term @xmath79 [ eq .  ( [ eq : lfhamiltonian ] ) ] in terms of the diagonal matrix @xmath80 we would like to emphasize that the random variables @xmath81 merely enter the diagonal matrix @xmath82 , while the @xmath75 matrices @xmath83 and @xmath74 are fixed throughout the entire mc simulation . thus , in total , we have @xmath84 and the fermionic trace is calculated as @xmath85 which is identical to the sum over the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath78 in the basis  ( [ eq : basis ] ) .",
    "the first observable of interest is the kinetic energy of the electrons defined as @xmath86 where we have exploited spin symmetry .",
    "following the same steps as in the derivation of the partition function we get @xmath87 writing out explicitly the fermionic trace we obtain @xmath88 and the kinetic energy finally becomes @xmath89 in addition to @xmath90 , we shall also consider the correlation function @xmath91 a simple calculation leads to @xmath92 finally , we would like to point out that other observables , such as the total energy and the momentum distribution @xmath93 , may also be measured within the current approach , while correlation functions such as @xmath94 or the quasiparticle weight can not be determined accurately.@xcite      we make use of the principal component representation and the reweighting procedure , which have been discussed in detail in i. defining the principal components @xmath95 , in terms of which @xmath70 [ eq .  ( [ eq : action - w - matrix ] ) ] takes a gaussian form which can be sampled exactly,@xcite allows to perform calculations that are free of any autocorrelations between successive phonon configurations . in combination with the reweighting , every new phonon configuration is accepted , and measurements can be made after each sweep through the @xmath96 space - time lattice .",
    "the reweighting refers to the use of the purely bosonic weight @xmath97 in the qmc simulation , while all the influence of the electrons and their interaction with the phonons  contained in @xmath98is treated exactly as part of the observables .",
    "the most significant difference between the present calculations and the one - electron case in i is the dimension of the matrices involved . while for one electron all matrices have size @xmath99@xmath100 being the extension of the 1d lattice under consideration  here",
    "the dimension is @xmath75 .",
    "clearly , this restricts calculations with respect to the number of lattice sites , especially in higher dimensions @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",
    "the total numerical effort for the current approach is proportional to @xmath103 .",
    "in contrast , the one - electron algorithm@xcite displays the same dependence @xmath104 as the determinant qmc method of blankenbecler et al.@xcite for the many - electron case , which can be reduced to @xmath105 by employing the checkerboard breakup of the hopping matrix.@xcite the increase in required computer time for the bipolaron results from the fixed number of electrons .",
    "recently , a grand - canonical version of the one - electron algorithm , also with a computer time @xmath106 , has been applied to study the dependence of polaron formation on carrier density in the spinless holstein model.@xcite for the bipolaron problem , we shall see below that the present algorithm allows one to study lattices of reasonable size @xmath107 , for a wide range of the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , we can obtain accurate results in the adiabatic regime @xmath108 .",
    "let us briefly compare our method to other qmc approaches to the hh bipolaron .",
    "the method of de raedt and lagendijk@xcite is based on an analytic integration over the phonon degrees of freedom , leading to a model with retarded el - el interaction .",
    "similar to our approach , it employs a suzuki - trotter approximation and gives results at finite temperatures . for simplicity , de raedt and lagendijk only considered the adiabatic limit @xmath35 , in which there are no retardation effects .",
    "the numerical effort grows as @xmath109 , but is virtually independent of the system size , so that simulations can be carried out even for large clusters in three dimensions .",
    "however , it is not clear how a small but finite phonon frequency @xmath108 will affect the computer time .",
    "macridin et al.@xcite used the diagrammatic qmc method to study two electrons on a @xmath110 lattice .",
    "although their approach does not rely on the suzuki - trotter decomposition , it is limited to zero temperature , and statistical errors increase noticeably for @xmath108 .",
    "moreover , the accuracy also decreases for large values of @xmath30 and/or @xmath31 , whereas we shall see in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] that we can easily study the strong el - ph coupling regime also for @xmath111 .    in i",
    ", we announced the possibility of reducing the numerical effort for the present method by exploiting the translational invariance of the model . to this end , the basis states ( [ eq : basis ] ) would have to be replaced by states @xmath112 with total quasimomentum @xmath113 , and with the two electrons separated by a distance @xmath114 .",
    "a similar idea has been used by kornilovitch@xcite for a single electron . in one dimension",
    ", the use of the basis @xmath112 would reduce the size of the matrices in the algorithm from @xmath75 to @xmath99 .",

    "( [ eq : matproduct ] ) ] for each allowed value of @xmath113 . in total",
    ", we could therefore reduce the numerical effort by a factor @xmath100 .",
    "the major drawback of using the reduced basis in momentum space is that it significantly complicates the program code .",
    "consequently , in this work , we have restricted ourselves to the straight - forward extension of the one - electron algorithm presented in i.    finally , the minus - sign problem , which has been mentioned in i , also exists here .",
    "however , as for one electron , it quickly diminishes with increasing system size , and does therefore not conceivably affect simulations .",
    "although the method can easily be applied also in higher dimensions , we wish to keep the notation simple and therefore restrict the derivation to @xmath116 .",
