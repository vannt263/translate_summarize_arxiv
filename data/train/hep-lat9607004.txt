    "the decay constant of the @xmath2 meson , @xmath3 , is of fundamental importance to tests of the standard model because it is needed in the determination of the ckm matrix . while one of the simplest weak matrix elements to study , it is not very well known and dominates the uncertainty in extracting @xmath6 , one of the smallest ckm elements , from @xmath7 mixing .",
    "the best chance of an experimental measurement of @xmath3 lies in the decay @xmath8 .",
    "however , this decay has yet to be observed , and @xmath3 appears in combination with @xmath9 , which is only known to within a factor of 2 .",
    "theoretical calculations using for example qcd sum rules within the framework of heavy quark effective theory  ( hqet )  @xcite and lattice field theory have been actively pursued over the last few years with the current world average standing at @xmath10  mev  @xcite .",
    "as a first principles approach , lattice simulations offer ultimately the most reliable calculation of @xmath3 .",
    "the initial problem of simulating a @xmath11 quark with compton wavelength of the order of the typical lattice spacing presently achievable was first solved by using the static approximation  @xcite , where the heavy quark is treated as a static colour source within the heavy - light meson .",
    "simulations using conventional relativistic methods around the @xmath12 meson showed the corrections to the static approximation in this region , and hence also at the @xmath2 meson , are much larger than naively expected .",
    "this has contributed to the sizable uncertainty remaining in @xmath3 , shown above .",
    "the determination of @xmath3 directly at @xmath13 on the lattice is required , and this is now possible with the development of non relativistic qcd  ( nrqcd )  @xcite . using this approach the error in the decay constant can be significantly reduced with the computational power currently available .",
    "initial calculations have already been performed by hashimoto  @xcite and davies  @xcite .",
    "this analysis forms the second stage of a project applying nrqcd to heavy - light systems and studying heavy quark symmetry at the @xmath2 meson .",
    "our previous papers have dealt with the @xmath2 meson spectrum in both the quenched approximation  @xcite and partially including the effects of sea quarks @xcite .",
    "we now present our results for the decay constants of the heavy - light mesons from dynamical configurations .",
    "note that the combination @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mixing parameter for the @xmath2 system , is the experimentally relevant quantity , and thus a calculation of @xmath15 is also needed .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ simdet ]",
    "we describe the simulation details including the systematic errors associated with the calculation .",
    "the meson operators required to compute the decay constant to @xmath1 are set out in section  [ mesop ] and we discuss computing the decay constant consistently to this order in terms of the evolution equation used .",
    "next , we examine the predictions of heavy quark symmetry for the behaviour of the decay constant in the heavy quark mass limit . the contributions from the interactions of the heavy quark at @xmath1",
    "are analysed and combinations of decay constants which isolate these individual contributions are discussed .",
    "section  [ results ] illustrates our results and fitting analysis with a subset of the data .",
    "the heavy quark mass dependence of the decay constants are investigated in section  [ hq_decay ] ; the individual non - perturbative @xmath1 coefficients of the slope of the decay constant are extracted .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in section  [ conc ] .",
    "the simulations were performed using 100 @xmath16 gauge configurations at @xmath17 with two flavours of staggered dynamical sea quarks with a bare quark mass of @xmath18 .",
    "these configurations were generously made available by the collaboration ; more details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we fixed the configurations to the coulomb gauge .",
    "the light quark propagators were generated using the wilson fermion action , without an @xmath19 improvement term , at two values of the hopping parameter , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the former corresponds to a quark mass close to strange , where @xmath22 from @xmath23 , while @xmath21 is somewhat lighter , with @xmath24 .    with only two values of light quark mass",
    "it is not possible to perform a trustworthy chiral extrapolation .",
    "in addition , the systematic errors associated with the light quarks , discussed below , affect the determination of the bare strange quark mass ; @xmath25 extracted from pseudoscalar mesons , using the lowest order chiral mass dependence to find the ` experimental mass ' of the pure @xmath26 pseudoscalar , differs from @xmath25 obtained from the vector meson @xmath27 .",
    "thus , most of the results will be presented for @xmath28 .    in this simulation",
    "we truncate the nrqcd series at @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the bare heavy quark mass , and the action takes the form : @xmath31 where @xmath32 tadpole improvement of the gauge links is used throughout i.e. they are divided by @xmath33 , where we use @xmath34 measured from the plaquette , and the hyperfine coefficient is given the tree - level value @xmath35 .",
    "we use the standard clover - leaf operator for the b field .",
    "the heavy quark propagators were computed using the evolution equation  @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the stabilising parameter . in the static limit",
    "this reduces to @xmath38    we generated heavy quark propagators at 11 values of ( @xmath39,n ) corresponding to ( 0.8,5 ) , ( 1.0,4 ) , ( 1.2,3 ) , ( 1.7,2 ) , ( 2.0,2 ) , ( 2.5,2 ) , ( 3.0,2 ) , ( 3.5,1 ) , ( 4.0,1 ) , ( 7.0,1 ) and ( 10.0,1 ) , and the static limit .",
    "this roughly corresponds to a range of meson masses from @xmath40 to @xmath41 and is sufficient for a reasonable investigation of heavy quark symmetry .",
    "however , it is not possible to simulate the @xmath12 meson on this lattice using nrqcd ; a larger lattice spacing is required , @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "details of the construction of meson operators , the smearing functions used and our fitting analysis can be found in  @xcite . as discussed in this reference",
    "there are large systematic errors associated with this simulation arising from the use of wilson light fermions",
    ". the emphasis of our analysis will be on determining the heavy quark mass dependence of the decay constants and extracting the nonperturbative coefficients of the heavy quark expansion to @xmath1 .",
    "the systematic error arising from the light quark in these @xmath44 coefficients is naively estimated to be a relative error of @xmath45 for this ensemble  ( where we take @xmath46 for these configurations ) .",
    "the truncation of the nrqcd series and the use of the tree - level value for the hyperfine coefficient introduce absolute errors of @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively . both correspond to approximately @xmath49 errors in the value and @xmath50 errors in the slope of the decay constant at @xmath13 .",
    "the coefficients of the quadratic term in the heavy quark expansion can not be correctly determined in this analysis .",
    "the size of the systematic errors induced by the light quark action are indicated by the large uncertainty in the lattice spacing ; we use @xmath51  gev .",
    "this gives @xmath52 as corresponding to the bare @xmath11 quark mass .",
    "we are currently repeating our analysis using tadpole - improved clover light fermions  @xcite .",
    "the pseudoscalar decay constant is defined by @xmath53 where @xmath54 at tree level and @xmath55 and @xmath56 represent 4-component light and heavy quark fields respectively . in this convention",
    "the experimental value of @xmath57 is @xmath58  mev .",
    "similarly , the vector decay constant is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 at tree level .",
    "the calculation of these matrix elements , and thus decay constants , to @xmath1 in nrqcd requires several operators . at tree level",
    "these can be obtained by relating @xmath56 of full qcd to the 2-component nrqcd fields , @xmath61 and @xmath62 for heavy quarks and heavy antiquarks respectively , using the foldy - wouthuysen transformation .",
    "to @xmath1 , @xmath63 with the convention that our meson states be built out of a heavy quark and a light antiquark , the @xmath62 field will not contribute to the above matrix elements through @xmath1 , and we obtain @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the axial current , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the vector current . @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote the upper and lower two components of @xmath55 respectively .",
    "our euclidean space @xmath71 matrices are chosen as , @xmath72    beyond tree level all operators with the same quantum numbers can mix under renormalisation .",
    "thus at @xmath73 the basis of operators for the axial current , is given by   @xmath74 using translation invariance , the zero momentum currents involving @xmath75 and @xmath76 are identical on the lattice and comparing with equation  [ foldycurr ] it is sufficient to calculate matrix elements of the tree level operators @xmath77 and @xmath75 .",
    "similarly , the basis of operators for the vector current , @xmath78 is reduced , for the numerical computation , to @xmath77 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 matrix properties have also been used .",
    "we computed the pseudoscalar and vector matrix elements corresponding to this minimal set of operators by inserting a smeared interpolating field with the same quantum numbers as @xmath77 at the source and all combinations of local currents at the sink for each meson .",
    "the perturbative calculation of the renormalisation factors needed to relate the matrix elements in nrqcd to the currents in full qcd has not yet been completed  @xcite .",
    "thus , we use the static renormalisation factors  @xcite and are restricted to the tree level @xmath1 corrections ; we omit @xmath82 for the vector meson .",
    "since this correction is of @xmath48 it is roughly the same size as that induced by unknown perturbative matching corrections in the coefficient @xmath83 , which are not included in the analysis .",
    "the renormalisation factors in nrqcd depend on the heavy quark mass and hence using the static value introduces an @xmath84 error into the @xmath1 coefficients extracted from our results .",
    "it is possible that the power divergences which appear in nrqcd may lead to significant non - perturbative contributions to the renormalisation factors  @xcite .",
    "no clear indication of ` renormalon ' effects has been found in other quantities calculated perturbatively in nrqcd  @xcite , however , we intend to compute the renormalisation factors non - perturbatively to check this .",
    "strictly , our analysis is not fully consistent to @xmath1 .",
    "note that the evolution equation given in equation  [ evol ] induces an @xmath85 systematic error in the currents .",
    "this is because it does not apply the relativistic correction operator @xmath86 on the initial timeslice .",
    "since all subsequent timeslices include this operator the transfer matrix is consistent to @xmath1 .",
    "thus , it is only in the amplitude of the meson correlator , i.e. the decay constant , that is missing this @xmath85 contribution .",
    "a better but computationally more costly evolution equation is given by @xmath87 for all timeslices .",
    "since our use of the wilson action for light quarks also induces errors of this order of magnitude , we used equation  [ evol ] in this project . in a comparison of these evolution equations using clover fermions for",
    "the light quarks  @xcite we found the insertion of @xmath86 on the source timeslice introduces @xmath88 correction to @xmath89 and @xmath90 correction to @xmath91 around @xmath92 . considering the systematic errors inherent in this calculation and our statistical accuracy of @xmath93 , the omission of this correction will not significantly affect our findings .",
    "in the heavy quark limit the decay constant can be parameterised in terms of an expansion in @xmath0 : @xmath94 the coefficient @xmath95 is determined by nonperturbative contributions arising from the hyperfine interaction  ( @xmath96 ) and the kinetic energy of the heavy quark  ( @xmath97 ) , which appear in the nrqcd action , and the corrections to the current arising from the foldy - wouthuysen transformation . from first order perturbation theory in @xmath0 about the static limit : @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 for pseudoscalar and vector mesons respectively .",
    "the integer factors in this equation are introduced for convenience when comparing with hqet .",
    "@xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 where @xmath104 represents the meson in the limit of infinite heavy quark mass , and equations  [ gkin]-[cooreqn ] are tree level expressions .",
    "note that the kinetic and hyperfine terms contribute to the decay constant through the correction to the meson wavefunction .",
    "equation  [ slope ] suggests that the individual contribution from each @xmath1 term can be obtained separately by taking appropriate combinations of the pseudoscalar and vector decay constants , @xmath105 and @xmath106 respectively . for clarity below , we denote @xmath107 with similar quantities defined for the vector particle by replacing ps with v. we also denote the spin - average of the decay constants , @xmath108    .expansions about the static limit to @xmath1 of combinations of the pseudoscalar and vector decay constant , with and without the current corrections .",

    "we presented a lattice study , partially including the effects of dynamical quarks , of the heavy - light pseudoscalar and vector decay constants using wilson light quarks and nrqcd heavy quarks .",
    "all @xmath1 terms in the nrqcd action and matrix elements were included ; an @xmath109 wave - function renormalization induced by the evolution equation is the same order as the light quark discretization errors .",
    "we find consistency between the extrapolation of the nrqcd result and the static case , as expected , although the static result is not very well determined .",
    "there are significant @xmath110 corrections to @xmath111 around @xmath13 , and this leads to a large systematic error in extracting @xmath3 ; the use of wilson light quarks introduces a systematic error of roughly the same magnitude .",
    "it is necessary to go to the next order in nrqcd and use an improved light quark action in order to reliably extract @xmath3 .",
    "we found the slope of the decay constants with @xmath0 to be significantly larger than that found in previous lattice simulations .",
