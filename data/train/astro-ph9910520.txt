    "in this paper we address two fundamental aspects which influence , to different extent , the photometric quality of high resolution spectra , i.e. the correction for the echelle blaze function ( ripple correction ) , and the absolute calibration .",
    "the results of this study , which are based on about one thousand spectra , mainly of  standard stars , have been implemented in the  newly extracted spectra system ( ) , a data archive and distribution facility developed by the  esa project ( see wamsteker et al .",
    "1999 ) , as well as in the  data reduction package ( nichols and linsky 1996 , garhart et al .",

    "the correction of  high resolution spectra for the echelle grating efficiency has for long been considered a critical area in the context of  data reduction procedures .",
    "the   system includes an upgraded ripple correction algorithm which is presented and discussed in the following .",
    "let us indicate with r@xmath1 ) the grating efficiency ( blaze function ) of the high resolution spectrographs , for a given order m and wavelength @xmath2 . as shown by ahmad ( 1981 ) and",
    "ake ( 1981 ) , this function is adequately represented by :    @xmath3    where    @xmath4    being @xmath5(m ) the wavelength of the central maximum of the blaze function for order m , and @xmath0 a parameter which can be shown to be , in the first approximation , inversely proportional to the half width at half maximum ( hwhm ) of the order considered :    @xmath6    the quantity    @xmath7    is called the ripple constant , but , as discussed in the following , it turns out to be a function of order number for the   setup .",
    "let us indicate with f(@xmath2 ) the observed net spectrum normalized to the exposure time .",
    "the shape of the blaze function r@xmath8 ) can be determined from the observations , knowing the inverse sensitivity curve of the camera ( s@xmath9(@xmath2)c(@xmath2 ) , see section [ sec : abscal ] ) , and the absolute flux of the target f(@xmath2 ) :    @xmath10    this equation implies that the blaze parameters can not be derived from f(@xmath2 ) directly , because it is affected by the distortions introduced by the multiplying factor c(@xmath2)s@xmath9(@xmath2)/f(@xmath2 ) , which is not only wavelength  dependent , but differs also from target to target .",
    "not having taken this fact into account is one of the major causes for the inaccuracy of the ripple correction in previous releases of the  data reduction packages and , in particular , for the suspected dependence of the ripple parameters on the spectral type of the source considered .",
    "our approach to derive the ripple parameters is equivalent to using eq .",
    "[ eq : erre ] , but is of much easier implementation .",
    "it consists in normalizing the observed spectrum to its continuum .",
    "the continuum was determined , for each spectral order , in correspondence to the expected peaks of the blaze function ( grady and garhart 1989 ) , where @xmath11 , and then interpolated over wavelength .",
    "let us indicate with y(@xmath2 ) the net spectrum extracted from order m after normalization to the continuum , and with t(m,@xmath2 ) its analytical representation .",
    "we can write :    @xmath12    where a@xmath13 is an adjustable parameter representing the net peak intensity of the blaze function ( at @xmath14 ) . because of normalization to the continuum , a@xmath15 .",
    "the unknown blaze parameters @xmath0 , @xmath16(m ) and a@xmath13 were determined iteratively , for each order , via a non - linear least - squares fitting algorithm , i.e. by minimizing @xmath17 .",
    "all the data points were given the same weight except those affected by saturation , itf extrapolation , reseau marks or particle events , which were discarded .",
    "spectral absorption features were also discarded through an automatic rejection procedure .",
    "an example of the fitting for the lwp05471 spectrum of the standard star bd+28  4211 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] .",
    "we stress that the ripple parameters should be derived , as done here , in vacuum wavelengths and in the velocity scale of the  spacecraft .      for this study",
    "we have selected 516 good quality high resolution spectra of the  calibration standards obtained between 1978 and 1995 , and namely : 182 spectra for the swp camera , 296 for the lwp and 138 for the lwr .",
    "this represents the near totality of data of this kind available . as input data we used the mhxi net spectra as extracted with . among the most frequently observed standards we quote bd+28 4211 , bd+75 325 , hd60753 , hd3360 , g191 b2b , ngc246 , hd120315 and hd93521 .",
    "in addition , to test specific aspects of the ripple correction algorithm , it was necessary to introduce about 200 net spectra ( also extracted with ) of targets having heterogeneous spectral types .",
    "the large majority of the spectra were obtained through the large entrance apertures of the spectrographs .",
    "a few small aperture spectra were also considered , whenever available , to cross - check the applicability of the large aperture ripple correction algorithm to that case . for the long wavelength cameras ,",

    "another test made was to verify the accuracy of the absolute calibration in the overlap region around 1950   between the swp and the lwp and lwr cameras .",
    "we find that , in this region , the short and long wavelength cameras agree to within 2 to 6% on average . as an example , we show in fig . [",
    "fig : over ] the overlap region for two pairs of spectra of hd60753 .",
    "the good match between short and long wavelength high resolution spectra can also be deduced from fig .",
    "[ fig : wr ] , which shows a combined swp - lwp spectrum of the wolf rayet star hd152270 .",
    "we note that residual non - linearity effects in the intensity transfer function , especially in the case of underexposed spectra , or spectra near the saturation limit , can occasionally cause a flux mismatch between the short and long wavelength cameras .",
    "we have shown that a reliable correction for the echelle blaze function can be obtained for  high resolution spectra processed with .",
    "we find that not only the k parameter , but also the @xmath0 parameter varies with order number , and that the central peaks of the blaze function deviate from the reference positions in a way which depends on the value of the thda temperature for the swp camera , and on the observation date for the lwp and lwr cameras .",
    "having taken into account all these dependences ( and not only the dependence of k on order number as in previous investigations ) , allows the present algorithm to successfully correct most spectra . according to our experience",
    ", the algorithm might fail in a few cases ( probably less then 5 - 10% ) .",
    "the identified cases of failure correspond to images in which the interorder background level is not properly evaluated with the  automatic extraction procedure or to cases in which the target is not acquired ( purposely or not ) in the center of the large entrance apertures of the  spectrographs . in this respect ,",
    "we note that a displacement of 1 arcsec along the dispersion line corresponds to a velocity shift of the wavelength scale of about 5 km / s , irrespective of the camera used .",
    "for example , a displacement of 5 arcsec , or 0.125   at 1500  would produce a flux mismatch in the overlap region midway between adjacent orders of about 4% .",
    "as for the absolute calibration of  high resolution spectra , we have shown that its internal accuracy is about 4% and that it applies both to continuum and emission line sources .",
    "the flatter shape of the c(@xmath2 ) function found here is due to the improved background extraction procedure in  ( smith 1999 ) ."
