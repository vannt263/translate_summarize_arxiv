    "we now have observational evidence that black holes indeed exist in nature .",
    "they are at the cores of quasars and other active galactic nuclei ( agns ) as well as sources in our galaxy , commonly referred to as microquasars or galactic black holes .",
    "many of these sources are associated with polar jets emanating from their cores .",
    "black holes were theoretically predicted from einstein s theory of general relativity .",
    "theoretical and numerical calculations ( williams 1991 , 1995 , 1999 , 2001 , 2002a , 2002b , 2003 ) , described briefly below , show that penrose ( 1969 ) gravitational - particle scattering processes are sufficient to describe energy - momentum extraction from a rotating kerr ( 1963 ) black hole , from radii within the marginal stable orbit ( @xmath4 , in gravitational units : @xmath5 ; @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the angular momentum per unit mass parameter and @xmath8 is the mass of the black hole ) , while electromagnetic interactions or magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) appear to govern the `` flow '' of polar jets of the extracted particles , escaping away from the central source , out to the observed distances , as suggested by observations ( junor , biretta , & livio 1999 ) .    in the primary paper",
    "cited above ( williams 1995 ) , theoretical model calculations involving monte carlo computer simulations of compton scattering and electron - positron ( @xmath9 ) pair production processes in the ergosphere of a supermassive ( @xmath10 ) rotating black hole are presented .",
    "particles from an accretion disk surrounding the rotating black hole fall into the ergosphere and scatter off particles that are in bound equatorially and nonequatorially confined orbits .",
    "the accretion flow is assumed to be of the form of the so - called _ two - temperature _ bistable disk model , in which the disk can in principle exist in two phases : a thin disk ( novikov & thorne 1973 ) and/or ion torus ( lightman & eardley 1974 ; shapiro , lightman , & eardley 1976 ; eilek 1980 ; eilek & kafatos 1983 ) , where the electrons and protons ( or ions ) can have separate temperatures of up to @xmath11  k and @xmath12  k , respectively .",
    "note that disk models of this sort are also referred to as thin disk / ion corona models , and more recently , the ion corona has been called an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; mahadevan , narayan , & krolik 1997 ) .",
    "the penrose mechanism , in general , allows rotational energy of a kerr black hole ( kbh ) to be extracted by scattered particles escaping from the ergosphere to large distances from the rotating black hole .",
    "the results of these model calculations show that the penrose mechanism is capable of producing the astronomically observed high energy particles ( @xmath13  gev ) emitted by quasars and other agns .",
    "this mechanism can extract hard x - ray to @xmath14-ray photons from penrose compton scatterings of initially low energy soft x - ray photons by target orbiting electrons in the ergosphere .",
    "the penrose pair production ( @xmath0 ) processes allow relativistic @xmath9 pairs to escape with energies up to @xmath15  gev , or greater depending on the form of the accretion disk ; these pairs are produced when infalling low energy photons collide with bound , highly blueshifted photons at the @xmath16 .",
    "this process may very well be the origin of the relativistic electrons inferred from observations to emerge from the cores of agns .",
    "importantly , these model calculations show that the lense - thirring effect ( thirring & lense 1918 ) , i.e. , the dragging of inertial frames into rotation , inside the ergosphere , caused by the angular momentum of the rotating black hole , results in a gravitomagnetic force being exerted on the scattered escaping particles .",
    "this force ( which is the gravitational analog or resemblance of a magnetic force ) produces asymmetrical particle emissions in the polar direction , above and below the equatorial plane , consistent with the asymmetrical or one - sided jets observed in radio strong agns ( williams 2002a , 1999 ) .",
    "the dragging of inertial frames also causes the penrose escaping particles to escape along vortical trajectories ( as discussed in the following paragraphs ) .",
    "these penrose processes can apply to any size rotating black hole and , in general , to any type of relativistic elementary particle scattering energy - momentum exchange process , inside the ergosphere , allowing particles to escape with rotational energy - momentum from the kbh . even in the context of mhd , according to the guiding center ( landau & lifshitz 1975 ) approximation , the single - particle approach is essential close to the black hole ( de felice & carlotto 1997 ; karas & doviak 1997 ; de felice & zonotti 2000 ) , i.e. , the behavior of individual particles moving along geodesics in the strong central gravitational force field is also that of the bulk of fluid elements .",
    "this suggests that even though a mhd simulation is not performed in this present paper , the results will be valid for the trajectories of particle flows and @xmath1 pairs produced near the black - hole event horizon .",
    "nevertheless , the penrose analysis presented here should be considered in the context of a full - scale relativistic mhd simulation .",
    "however , because of the proximity of the penrose processes to the horizon , and the dominating effect of gravity , the resulting trajectories are expected to be approximately the same in the mhd regime .    in the model calculations summarized above , in which energy - momentum is extracted from a rotating black hole , it is found that particles escape with relativistic velocities along vortical trajectories , above and below the equatorial plane , with small helical angles of escape , implying strong coil - like vortex plasma collimation ( williams 2001 , 2002b ) .",
    "thus , from these model calculations , it appears that the rotating black hole naturally produces particle trajectories collimated about the axis of symmetry , i.e. , the polar axis .",
    "such vortical orbits or trajectories have been discussed by some other authors ( de felice & calvani 1972 ; de felice & curir 1992 ; de felice & carlotto 1997 ; de felice & zanotti ( 2000 ) ; see also bik , semerk , & hadrava 1993 ; karas & doviak 1997 ) .",
    "their independent findings , deduced from the geodesic properties of the kerr metric , and referred to as geometry induced collimation , can serve as confirmation of williams ( 1991 , 1995 ) theoretical and numerical calculated results , or vice versa .    in this paper ,",
    "i examine the escape conditions and the resulting four - momentum vectors of the penrose pair production ( @xmath0 ) processes , showing that the particles indeed escape to infinity in the form of vortical jets intrinsically collimated about the polar axis , because of the frame dragging of spacetime inside the ergosphere of the kbh .",
    "importantly , we shall see that these @xmath1 pairs escape without any appreciable interaction with the dynamically stable accretion disk particles .",
    "now , although most of the penrose compton scattered photons escape along vortical trajectories as well , we are concerned , in this paper , only with the penrose pair production ( @xmath0 ) electrons , because these are the particles that compile the main constituents of the observed jets , being responsible for the synchrotron radiation and doppler boosting ( giving rise to superluminal motion ) .",
    "i refer the reader to the above references , particularly williams ( 1995 ) , for a thorough description of the `` penrose - williams '' ( williams 2002b ) processes discussed in this present paper .",
    "after the scattering events , not all of the particles escape to infinity .",
    "a set of escape conditions must be applied to see if a particular particle escapes from the gravitational potential well of the black hole [ see williams ( 1995 ) and references therein for further descriptions of the escape conditions ] .",
    "it is known that outside the event horizon , the orbit of a photon ( or an unbound material particle with @xmath17 ) , may have one or no radial turning points for which @xmath18 ( piran & shaham 1977 ; williams 1995 ) , where @xmath19 is the energy of the particle as measured by an observer at infinity ; @xmath20 is the rest mass energy ; and @xmath21 is the radial component of the covariant four - momentum vector @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath23 define the conserved azimuthal coordinate angular momentum ( @xmath24 ) , then if @xmath25 for that particle lies in the range @xmath26 for a direct orbit not confined to the equatorial plane [ @xmath27 ; @xmath28 is the so - called carter constant of motion ( carter 1968 ) : @xmath29 , \\label{eq : carter}\\ ] ] where the value of @xmath28 is zero for particles whose motions are confined to the equatorial plane ] , there will be one turning point ; otherwise , there will be none , where @xmath30 is the iso - energy orbit : the circular orbit of equal energy at constant radius @xmath31 , a potential turning point , and @xmath32 is the corresponding azimuthal angular momentum .",

    "that the penrose produced @xmath1 pairs escape to infinity along vortical trajectories without any appreciable interaction with stable accretion disk particles can be seen in the momentum spectra of figures  1 , 2 ( for a supermassive kbh ) , and figure  3 ( for a `` micro - massive '' kbh ) , as explained in the paragraphs below .",
    "note , in gravitational units ( @xmath57 ) such distribution spectral plots for the same initial energies are approximately the same irrespective of the mass of the black hole adopted to make the plot ( see williams 2002b ) .",
    "the penrose pair production processes used to calculate figures  1 , 2 , and  3 are for an idealized configuration with the purpose to simply show the effect of the inertial frame dragging [ produced by the gravitational field of the spinning black hole , i.e. , its gravitomagnetic field ( williams 1999 ; 2002a ) ] , and not an attempt to connect the calculations to detailed observations .",
    "nevertheless , the initial energies used for these penrose processes are based on energies found to exist in relativistic accretion disk models ( novikov & thorne 1973 ; eilek 1980 ; eilek & kafatos 1983 ) for black hole masses @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and the expected blueshift in orbital energies : increased by the factor @xmath60 at the photon orbit ( williams 1995 ) , where @xmath61 is the contravariant diagonal time component of the kerr metric in boyer - lindquist ( 1967 ) coordinates ; such initial energies yield final results consistent with general observed jet particle energies .",
    "the initial incident photons , indicated by the subscript @xmath62 , are assumed to infall radially along the equatorial plane [ @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) , with energies @xmath65  mev for figures  1 and 2 ; @xmath66  mev for figure  3 .",
    "these incident photons are allowed to collide with highly blueshifted target photons that orbit at the photon orbit @xmath67 , in nonequatorially confined trajectories , which repeatedly cross ( i.e. , pass through ) the equatorial plane in `` spherical - like '' orbits that reach certain latitudinal angles ( wilkin 1972 ) .",
    "the collision is assumed to take place when the target photon passes through the equatorial plane .",
    "the initial orbital parameters for the target photons , indicated by the subscript @xmath68 , are given by equations  ( [ eq : orb1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : orb2 ] ) for a particular @xmath69 .",
    "specifically , the target photon orbits can be populated by prior penrose compton scattering ( williams 1995 ; 2002b ) , and probably by proton - proton scatterings of neutral pions that decay ( @xmath70 ) , occurring in `` hot '' adafs ( eilek & kafatos 1983 ; mahadevan , narayan , & krolik 1997 ) , assuming some of the @xmath71decay photons are created with appropriate @xmath28 values and energies to become bound at the photon orbit ( williams 1995 , 2002a ) .",
    "now , in a realistic situation the incident and target particles are not constrained to this idealized configuration , but this configuration , including the range of initial energies used ( see also captions of figs .",
    "1 , 2 , and  3 ) , is most efficient and allows maximum energy - momentum extraction ( williams 1995 ) .",
    "figures  1@xmath7 , 2@xmath7 , and  3@xmath7 show the azimuthal momenta @xmath46 of the penrose pair production ( @xmath0 ) versus the energy @xmath45 of the escaping electron pairs after 2000 events [ each point ( i.e. , tiny dot ) represents an escaping particle resulting from the events ] . in general , since the energy @xmath19 as measured by an observer at infinity is linearly proportional to the azimuthal angular momentum @xmath23 in the transformation laws , from the local nonrotating frame to the observer s frame at infinity [ compare eqs .",

    "( compare also equation  [ [ eq : orb1 ] ] ) , which is apparently transferred to the scattered particles , the scatter plots ( figs .",
    "1@xmath7 , 2@xmath7 , 3@xmath7 ) representing the approximately 2000 escaping electrons per plot appear linear .",
    "figures  1@xmath72 , 2@xmath72 , and  3@xmath72 show the azimuthal coordinate momentum versus energy of the @xmath1 pairs , superimposed on the azimuthal coordinate momentum versus energy , orbital parameters , of an electron orbit not confined to the equatorial plane ( wilkins 1972 ) , at @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the radii of marginally bound and marginally stable orbits , respectively .",
    "the conserved orbital parameters @xmath19 and @xmath23 for the nonequatorially confined orbits ( for massless and material particles ) , which reduce to the forms of bardeen , press , teukolsky ( 1972 ) for @xmath75 , as measured by an observer at infinity , are given by equations  ( [ eq : orb1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : orb2 ] ) .",
    "notice on figures  1@xmath72 , 2@xmath72 , and  3@xmath72 that for @xmath76 at @xmath73 , @xmath77 most of the escaping @xmath1 pairs have @xmath78 , indicating turning points inside the inner radius of the stable accretion disk ( @xmath79 ) ; and some , particularly the higher energy pairs , have turning points inside @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , compare figures  1@xmath72 , 2@xmath72 , and  3@xmath72 over the total energy range to see that the curves for @xmath74 and @xmath73 do not merge into one curve at lower energies ; they only appear to on figures  1@xmath72 and  2@xmath72 .",
    "this , as well as the satisfaction of the turning point condition stated above ( according to equation  [ [ eq : escape1 ] ] ) at @xmath80 @xmath73 and/or @xmath81 @xmath74 , can clearly be seen when comparing figures  4 and  5 , which show specific intervals for the cases displayed in figures  1@xmath72 and  2@xmath72 .",
    "notice also that , the display in figures  1@xmath82 , 2@xmath82 , and  3@xmath82 , showing @xmath83 for @xmath76 at @xmath73 , @xmath77 for most of the escaping @xmath1 pairs , means that these electrons escape to infinity along vortical trajectories , with helical angles of escape , measured relative to the equatorial plane , @xmath84 to @xmath85 , @xmath86 to @xmath85 , and @xmath87 to @xmath85 , for the electrons displayed in figures  1 , 2 , and  3 , respectively ( see fig .  6",
    "; see also williams 2002b , 2002a ) .    finally , notice that in figure  1@xmath82 , some of the @xmath1 pairs with @xmath88  mev do not escape and can possibly become bound , i.e. , populate the orbits , at @xmath73 or @xmath74 for `` later '' penrose compton scattering events , involving these nonequatorially confined electrons as targets ( williams 1995 , 2002b ) .",
    "this shows that these penrose processes and the accretion disk assumed ( williams 1995 ) can compile a self - consistent model producing the three general spectral high energy regimes observed in all agns , more or less ( e.g. , compare figure  8 of williams 2003 ) .",
    "that is , for a particular self - consistent case , somewhat _",
    "similar _ to that of figure  1 , from prior penrose compton scattering of initial photons ( @xmath89  mev ) by equatorially confined electron targets at @xmath90 , the final inward scattered photons @xmath91  kev , with turning points after being blueshifted by a factor of @xmath92 ( williams 2002a ) , can populate the photon orbit for penrose pair production ( @xmath0 ) , which in turn yields electrons that can populate the nonequatorially confined target orbits : with energies up to @xmath93  mev , similar to that seen in figure  1@xmath82 , for subsequent penrose compton scattering . in this self - consistent case , however , @xmath45 can extend up to @xmath94  mev ( compare fig .  1 ) .",
    "note , the population of the target particle orbits and accretion disk properties are discussed in details in williams ( 1995 , 2002a , 2002b , 2003 ) .    the helical angles of escape stated above ( compare fig .  6 ) , and given analytically by @xmath95 } ^{1/2 } , \\label{eq : helical1}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 [ as derived from the `` carter constant '' of motion by letting @xmath97 ( see equation  [ [ eq : carter ] ] ; see also piran & shaham 1977 ) , where @xmath98 for escaping below `` @xmath99 '' or above `` @xmath100 '' the equatorial plane ] , suggest that the particles escape to large distances along coil - like geodesics conglomerated in the form of collimated swirling current plasma polar jets , with energy - momentum of the kbh transferred from the highly blueshifted frame dragged scattering events .",
    "now , a test particle moves on a geodesic in a gravitational field if it is not acted on by some external force , but if the parameters such as energy and angular momentum vary with time , then forces are present that can destroy the geodesic character of the motion .",
    "but the geodesic character of a trajectory , however , can be approximately saved if the time scale of a significant variation of the physical parameters , say @xmath101 , is longer than the dynamical time , @xmath102 , associated with a geodesic trajectory ( de felice & carlotto 1997 ) .",
    "this means that , if the orbital parameters vary slightly so as to preserve the initial @xmath103 angle ( i.e. , the emission angle of the particle above or below the equatorial plane ) , then under suitable conditions , say in a suitable electromagnetic field , we obtain a net axial collimation .",
    "calculations by de felice & carlotto ( 1997 ) ; karas & doviak ( 1997 ) suggest that the average dynamical time associated with the vortical geodesics is sufficiently short to give confidence that the average time of a significant variation of the physical parameters , due to dissipative or accelerating processes , is long enough to ensure the geodesicity condition on outgoing vortical orbits .",
    "this then can possibly permit the maintenance of the intrinsic collimation of the penrose scattered particles by the kbh , particularly because of the sturdiness or stiffness ( de felice & carlotto 1997 ) of the coil - like structure of the geodesics .",
    "moreover , their calculations also show that for a lorentz force acting on a charge particle near the event horizon , for a @xmath58 kbh , inertia and gravity dominate over electromagnetic disturbance .    for completeness",
    ", the overall difference in the distributions of the polar angles of escape , displayed in figure  6 , is a general relativistic effect due to the gravitomagnetic ( gm ) force field acting on the momentum of individual particles , resulting in an `` alteration '' of the incoming and scattering angles .",
    "the resultant force in the polar direction , as conveyed in the spectra of figure  6 , depends largely on the counterbalance between the dynamics of the nonequatorially confined target photons orbits ( with latitudinal angles @xmath104 about the equatorial plane ) and the gm force .",
    "note , an important feature of the gm field ( caused by the angular momentum of the rotating black hole ) is the production of symmetrical and asymmetrical polar jets : appearing to break the expected reflection symmetry of the kerr metric , above and below the equatorial plane ( williams 2002a ) .",
    "the general shapes of the spectra are not the same because the energy - momenta of the initial and escaping particles , in the three cases ( figs .",
    "6@xmath105 ) are different ; therefore , the gm force ( @xmath106 ) , acting proportional to the momentum ( @xmath107 ) of a particle , will be different , where @xmath108 is the gm tensor ( thorne , price , & macdonald 1986 ) .",
    "the gm force behaves in some degree like a `` coriolis force , '' acting on the momentum of particles in the local inertial frame that has been dragged into rotation .",
    "this can be somewhat understood by looking at the gm force component in the polar direction : @xmath109 with @xmath110 as defined by the components of the gm tensor for @xmath111 , where it appears that the spacetime frame dragging is so severe that the gm field lines are distorted into the direction of rotation , producing the nonzero @xmath112 term ( williams 2002a ) .",
    "notice in equation  ( [ eq : gm ] ) , using equation  ( [ eq : gm1 ] ) , that the first term maintains equatorial reflection symmetry , while the second term introduces asymmetry ; this second term is expected to exist effectively only near the event horizon ( @xmath113 ) , i.e. , inside the ergosphere : the region of importance for the penrose mechanism to operate .",
    "a general analysis of equations  ( [ eq : gm ] ) and  ( [ eq : gm1 ] ) reveals the following conditions :    * at @xmath114 , @xmath115 or @xmath116 , the force on the particle will be @xmath117 or @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "* at @xmath119 , @xmath116 , @xmath120 , the force on the particle will be @xmath117 for @xmath121 , and @xmath118 for @xmath122 . * at @xmath123 , @xmath116 , @xmath120 , the force on the particle will be @xmath118 .",
    "we now use the three conditions above to explain the escaping particle distribution in the individual spectra of figure  6 . the momentum components ( @xmath124 , @xmath21 ) and the polar angle ( @xmath125 ) are to be compared with that of the initial and escaping particles . in the case of the lowest energy ( fig .  6@xmath82 ; see also fig .",
    "3 ) target ( @xmath126  mev ) and incoming ( @xmath66  mev ) photons , the initial asymmetry , favoring the positive @xmath127 direction , is established by the gm field acting on the radially infalling photons according to condition  1 .",
    "the outward radial momenta of the escaping electrons with @xmath128 , according to conditions  1@xmath1003 , are not large enough to overcome the force produced by @xmath117 ; therefore , the asymmetry remains . for the lowest energy escaping electrons",
    ", the gm force dominates over the dynamics of the target photons , resulting in helical angles of escape @xmath129 for most of the escaping electrons .",
    "also , the @xmath130 component has a larger absolute value for a particle with a larger @xmath131 ( williams 2002a ) , thus contributing to the distribution being forced away from the equatorial plane according to conditions  2 and  3 ( compare eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : gm ] ] and  [ [ eq : gm1 ] ] ) . finally , in this particular case , as the energy of the escaping electrons increases , the gm force dominates less and less , while the orbital dynamics of the target photons begin to dominate , producing smaller @xmath131 values , consistent with the latitudinal angles of the target photons ( which are @xmath104 ) .    in the case of the somewhat higher energy ( fig .",
    "6@xmath7 ; see also fig .",

    "the gm force dominates over the dynamics of the target photons , resulting in helical angles of escape as high as @xmath133 according to conditions  2 and  3 . nevertheless , as the energy of the escaping electrons increase , the orbital dynamics of the target photons begin to dominate , producing smaller @xmath131 values .",
    "in the case of the highest energy ( fig .  6@xmath72 ; see also fig .",
    "2 ) target ( @xmath134  mev ) and incoming ( @xmath65  mev ) photons , the asymmetry , favoring the positive @xmath127 direction , caused by the gm field acting on the the radially infalling photons according to condition  1 and the high energy escaping electrons according to condition  2 , where @xmath117 dominates for @xmath121 ( recall that @xmath124 increases with increasing @xmath19 ) , appears to dominate over @xmath118 in conditions  1@xmath1003 .",
    "also , except for the relatively very lowest energy of the escaping pairs , the orbital dynamics of the target photons appear to dominate over the gm force , as the escaping energy increases , producing predominantly electrons with @xmath135 .",
    "note , in these penrose processes , the gm force is inherently tied to the overall scattering process through the kerr metric .",
    "that is , just as we do not have to calculate separately the gravitational force on the scattered particles due to the mass @xmath8 of the kbh , we do not have to calculate separately the gm force on the scattered particles due to the angular momentum @xmath136 of the kbh .",
    "the gm force , however , is given here separately only to show how it relates to the final four - momenta of the scattered particles , in an effort to explain the major difference of spectral distributions displayed in figure  6 .",
    "in this paper , i have shown that the penrose pair production ( @xmath0 ) electrons , of processes occurring at the photon orbit @xmath137 , escape to infinity along vortical trajectories about the polar axis , without any appreciable interaction with the stable accretion disk particles ( which are located at @xmath138 ) .",
    "this is also expected to be true for the penrose compton scattered escaping photons that have inward directed radial momenta with turning points at @xmath139 , escaping along vortical orbits concentric to the polar axis ( williams 2001 , 2002b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "since the penrose compton scattering processes occur at radii @xmath140 the scattered photons with positive radial momenta probably have appreciable interaction with the inner region of the accretion disk , as suggested by the broad fe k@xmath141 emission line at @xmath142  kev observed in the bright seyfert  1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) ; see the qualitative description in williams ( 2002b ) .",
    "details concerning mcg6 - 30 - 15 will be investigated in a future paper .",
    "overall , these vortical trajectories of escaping particles suggest that the kbh is responsible for the precollimation ( de felice & curir 1992 ; de felice & carlotto 1997 ; de felice & zanotti 2000 ; see also bik , semerk , & hadrava 1993 ; karas & doviak 1997 ) of the observed jets of relativistic particles , emanating from the cores of objects powered by black holes ( compare junor , biretta , & livio 1999 ) .",
    "note , the coil - like collimation of the vortical orbits , presented here , and those of the penrose compton scattering processes , are investigated in further details elsewhere .",
    "further investigations of this precollimation will include the self - induced dynamo magnetic field associated with the vortical orbiting escaping penrose produced ( @xmath0 ) pairs ; such a field could be an important contribution to the observed synchrotron emission as well as in maintaining collimation .",
    "recent polarization measures ( e.g. , see homan 2004 and references therein ) appear to be consistent with the dynamics and kinematics of these vortical polar trajectories of escaping electrons .",
    "the degree to which the above statement applies consistently , with the interpretation that the observed transverse rotation - measure gradients across the jets ( gabuzda & murray 2003 ) are due to an intrinsic helical magnetic field structure associated with the accretion disk , must be looked at in detail .",
    "the best - case scenario would be for the magnetic field of the accretion disk to assist in further collimating and accelerating the penrose produced relativistic jet particles as they escape from the black hole out to observed distances .    in comparison with some mhd energy extraction models , of the blandford - znajek ( 1977 ) and blandford - payne ( 1982 ) type , we find the following .",
    "firstly , because of the proximity of the penrose pair production ( @xmath0 ) processes ( williams 1995 ) to the event horizon , i.e. , occurring at the photon orbit @xmath137 inside the marginally bound orbit @xmath73 ( the last radius for any bound material particle before it falls directly into the black hole ) , the accretion disk magnetic field , proposed to be frozen to the plasma particles ( e.g. , koide et al . 2002 ; koide 2003 ; meier , koide , & uchida 2001 ) , is expected to have a negligible effect on these pair production processes , even without considering that the existences of such magnetic fields or `` flux tubes '' near the event horizon are inconsistent with general relativistic findings by bik ( 2000 ) and bik & ledvinka ( 2000 ) .",
    "these findings reveal that such fields , if aligned with the rotation axis , will be expelled from the horizon or redshifted away , for a rapidly rotating black hole ( i.e. , a near extreme kbh ) .",
    "now based on these findings , it is probably safe to say that the disk magnetic field may have little , if any , effect on the penrose compton scattering processes ( williams 1995 ) , particularly those occurring at @xmath143 , the radii first to be populated by the target electrons ( williams 2002b ) and where the most energy would be extracted for a specific @xmath144 value [ compare the bound electron orbits displayed in figs .",
    "1@xmath82 and  3@xmath82 ; see also fig .",
    "1(b ) of williams 1995 ] .",
    "the radius of marginally bound orbit @xmath73 is closer to the event horizon ( @xmath145 ) than it is to @xmath74 ( @xmath146 ) , where @xmath147 for @xmath148 ( bardeen et al .",
    "1972 ) .",
    "secondly , the main advantage of the penrose - williams processes , over such blandford - znajek ( 1977 ) and blandford - payne ( 1982 ) type models , is that the penrose - williams gravitational energy - momentum extraction processes occur independently of a magnetic field , while producing highly relativistic particles that escape to infinity along intrinsically collimated vortical trajectories in the form of symmetrical or asymmetrical jets , because of the inertial frame dragging .",
    "another feature of these processes is that most of the energy extracted is gravitational binding energy with only a small fraction of the scattered particles having final negative energies ( up to @xmath149% of the penrose compton scattered photons and up to @xmath150% of the penrose pair produced electrons , occurring only in the lowest energy - momentum scattering processes ) , which means that the angular momentum of the black hole will not decrease significantly in these processes .",
    "the lifetime of these processes is expected to be indefinite as long as there is matter to be accreted , since positive energy - momentum particles are also scattered into the kbh .",
    "the resulting escaping plasma jets are expected to generate a self - induced dynamo magnetic field , as stated above , in the form of a polar solenoid - like field , which could possibly magnetically confine and further assist in acceleration , collimation processes , as well as producing observed synchrotron radiation .",
    "importantly , as soon as the inner region unstable disk particles reach a temperature @xmath151  kev  the energy needed to populate the target particle orbits for penrose compton scattering , assuming , of course , the probable existence of turning points ( compare eq .",
    "[ [ eq : escape1 ] ] and discussion in   [ sec : orbits ] ) , this penrose process can `` turn on '' ( williams 2002b ) , irrespective of the mass of the rotating black hole .",
    "moreover , the general observed high energy luminosity spectra of quasars and microquasars can be reproduced by these processes ( see williams 2002b , 2003 ) .",
    "the above features are general characteristics of observed black hole sources .",
    "none of the 3-d mhd energy extraction jet models at the present ( e.g. , koide et al .",
    "2000 ; meier et al . 2001",
    "; koide et al . 2002 ; koide 2003 , 2004 ) exhibit such characteristic features in such details as does the penrose - williams mechanism . nevertheless",
    ", 3-d mhd models can possible achieve the necessary powers ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; meier et al .",
    "2001 ) , but , in some cases , only after assuming an unrealistically large strength magnetic field .",
    "lastly , it appears that the modern - day blandford - znajek ( 1977 ) and blandford - payne ( 1982 ) type models are essentially faced with the age - old problem of converting from electromagnetic energy to particle energy and thus the inability of generating the highly relativistic particles needed to be consistent with observations .",
    "the problems associated with such models in the direct extraction of energy near the event horizon suggest that these models may be important in the weak gravitational field limit , serving perhaps the same purpose they do in the jets of protostars , i.e. , appearing to have a dominant role on a large scale at distances outside the strong effects of general relativity .",
    "the recent model of koide ( 2004 ) and its application to @xmath14-ray bursts , assuming a large scale , superstrong radial magnetic field ( @xmath152  g ) down to the event horizon of a rapidly rotating kbh ( @xmath153 ) , produces a mildly relativistic outflow . not only , at least at the present , does this model not collimate , but it may not be consistent with the general relativistic determination that any `` radiatable '' multipole field gets radiated away completely as a star collapses to a kbh ( de la cruz , chase , & israel 1970 ; price 1972 ) , which includes the magnetic field , leaving only nonzero monopole parameters @xmath8 , @xmath136 , and @xmath154 , where @xmath136 ( @xmath155 ) is the black - hole angular momentum , and @xmath154 is the electric charge , hence the `` no - hair theorem '' ( misner , thorne , & wheeler 1973 ; carter 1973 ) . also , the problem remains in the model of koide ( 2004 ) as to how such a superstrong field is created in the popular ( or generally accepted ) model of stellar evolution .    in any case , the penrose - williams processes described in this paper ( see also williams 2002a , 2002b , 2003 ) may be related to the beamed energy output observed in @xmath14-ray bursts .",
    "it is suspected that these processes , which could `` quickly '' turn on and off under suitable conditions , might be important .",
    "particularly , these processes might prove to be invaluable in explaining the jets in so - called collapsars , i.e , black hole formation in massive stars with rotation ( macfadyen , woosley , & heger 2001 ) , without the needed of a superstrong magnetic field .",
    "equally , considering an `` inactive '' and/or perhaps `` isolated '' rotating black hole , if its tidal forces encounter and destroy an object of sufficient density , then as the debris is infalling , these penrose processes could produce characteristics associated with some @xmath14-ray bursts : an energetic short - lived burst , collimation , synchrotron emission , as well as the afterglows in the x - ray ( costa et al .",
    "1997 ) , optical ( van paradijs et al . 1997 ) , and radio ( frail et al .",
    "1997 ) regimes .",
    "that is , @xmath14-ray and x - ray jets can be produced possibly from penrose compton scattering , and radio to optical synchrotron jet emission from subsequent penrose pair production ( @xmath0 ) electrons , interacting with the expected intrinsically induced magnetic field ( mentioned above ) .",
    "details of the application of these penrose processes to @xmath14-ray bursts await future investigations .",
    "note , in general , evaluation in a full - scale relativistic mhd regime is needed to follow the evolution of the trajectories of the escaping penrose particles and their interactions with the intrinsically induced magnetic field and that of the surrounding accretion disk .",
    "this indeed will be a challenge . yet , with existing mhd 3-d simulations , and since we have analytical expressions for the trajectories of the escaping particles ( see williams 2002a ) , such a task could be accomplished .",
    "finally , for completeness , even though the penrose processes present here are quite efficient ( williams 1995 ) without a magnetic field , the presence of a disk magnetic field , however , inside the ergosphere , might increase the efficiency ( see wagh & dadhich 1989 and references therein ) .",
    "the effects of such a magnetic field , if sufficiently small , might be represented by a random motion superimposed on the orbital velocities of the charged particles , say the target electrons in penrose compton scattering ( see e.g. williams 1995 ) .",
