    "white dwarf stars are the most common end - point of stellar evolution .",
    "they provide a wealth of information about the evolution of their progenitor stars , and the physical processes occurring in stars .",
    "they also provide valuable information about the star formation history of the solar neighborhood , and allow us to study the properties of various stellar populations ",
    "see , and for reviews .",
    "in particular , white dwarfs are used as accurate age indicators for a wide variety of galactic populations , including the disk , and open and globular clusters  see and for some recent applications .",
    "the use of white dwarfs as reliable and precise clocks to date stellar populations has prompted the computation of detailed and complete evolutionary models for these stars , taking into account all the relevant sources and sinks of energy , and the evolutionary history of progenitor stars .",
    "the computation of such models requires a detailed knowledge of the main physical processes responsible for their evolution . among these processes , and",
    "relevant for the present paper , is the slow gravitational settling of @xmath0ne in the liquid phase , that has been shown to strongly decrease the cooling rate of white dwarfs resulting from high - metallicity ( @xmath8 ) progenitors @xcite .",
    "@xmath0ne is the most abundant impurity present in the carbon - oxygen interiors of typical white dwarfs , and is the result of helium burning of the @xmath9n built up during the cno cycle . in particular",
    ", the two additional neutrons present in the @xmath0ne nucleus ( relative to @xmath10 ) results in a net downward gravitational force and a slow settling of @xmath0ne in the liquid regions towards the center of the white dwarf .",
    "the role of @xmath0ne sedimentation in the energetics of crystallizing white dwarfs was first addressed by , and quantitatively explored later by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that @xmath0ne sedimentation releases substantial energy to modify appreciably the cooling of massive white dwarfs , delaying the evolution by about @xmath11 yrs at low luminosities ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the occurrence of this process in the interior of cool white dwarfs has been shown to be a key factor in solving the longstanding age discrepancy of the metal - rich cluster ngc  6791 @xcite    the studies of @xcite and @xcite revealed the necessity of including the gravitational energy released by @xmath0ne sedimentation in the calculations of detailed white dwarf cooling sequences .",
    "motivated by these findings , in this paper we investigate the impact of @xmath0ne sedimentation on the cooling age of white dwarfs resulting from solar metallicity progenitors .",
    "our aim is to provide an accurate assessment of the differences in the cooling ages when this process is neglected .",
    "the results presented here improve our previous works in two ways .",
    "first , the calculations presented here include realistic initial @xmath0ne abundance distributions in the white dwarf interior , resulting from the evolutionary history of progenitor stars .",
    "in particular , we compute the full evolution of progenitor stars starting from the zams all the way through the phases of hydrogen and helium core burning and the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) . in this way we obtained realistic initial @xmath0ne profiles at the beginning of the white dwarf cooling sequence , necessary to accurately compute the energy released by the slow @xmath0ne sedimentation along the entire white dwarf cooling track . and ,",
    "secondly , the physical description of @xmath0ne diffusion in strongly coupled plasma mixtures is substantially improved .",
    "specifically , in our calculations we employ the new diffusion coefficients for @xmath0ne based on the molecular dynamics simulations of @xmath13c , @xmath14o , and @xmath0ne mixtures of @xcite .",
    "these diffusion coefficients are now accurately known .",
    "thus , the remaining uncertainties in their specific values should not be relevant for white dwarf evolutionary calculations .",
    "we extend the scope of the paper by exploring the consequences of @xmath0ne sedimentation for the adiabatic pulsational properties of zz  ceti stars . to this end",
    ", we perform an adiabatic , nonradial pulsation analysis of @xmath15-modes .",
    "the results presented here are the first ones in showing the impact of @xmath0ne sedimentation on the expected spectrum of pulsation periods of evolving zz  ceti star models .",

    "particularly , it has been used to compute very accurate and realistic white dwarf models . a recent test comparing lpcode with a different white dwarf",
    "evolutionary code shows that uncertainties in the white dwarf cooling ages that result from the different numerical implementations of the stellar evolution equations are less than 2% .",

    "the evolution of the models before the white dwarf stage is described in detail in @xcite , to which the reader is referred .",
    "in contrast with our previous studies of the impact of @xmath0ne sedimentation on white dwarf evolution , in this work we have considered realistic initial @xmath0ne profiles at the beginning of the cooling track .",
    "relevant to this aspect , we mention that lpcode considers a simultaneous treatment of non - instantaneous mixing(and extra - mixing if present ) , element diffusion ( chemical and thermal diffusion plus gravitational settling ) and nuclear burning of elements .",
    "the code treats convective boundary mixing as a diffusion process by assuming that mixing velocities decay exponentially beyond each convective boundary .",
    "specifically , we assumed a diffusion coefficient @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the pressure scale height at the convective boundary , @xmath21 is the diffusion coefficient of unstable regions close to the convective boundary , and @xmath22 is the geometric distance from the edge of the convective boundary .",
    "convective boundary mixing has been considered during the core hydrogen and helium burning phases and in the thermally - pulsing agb .",
    "the convective boundary mixing efficiency @xmath23 has been calibrated to different values in different convective boundaries in order to reproduce different observables during the pre - white dwarf phase  see @xcite for details .",

    "for the low - temperature regime we used the molecular opacities with varying carbon - to - oxygen ratios of @xcite , presented in .",
    "these opacities are necessary for a realistic treatment of the evolution of the progenitor during the thermally - pulsing agb phase . at low effective temperatures in the white dwarf regime , outer boundary conditions for the evolving models",

    "another improvement with respect to our previous studies , is that we have included in this work the most recent determination of the @xmath0ne diffusion coefficients @xcite .",
    "we have also improved our numerical treatment for @xmath0ne sedimentation by assuming that @xmath0ne diffuses in a one component plasma background , consisting of a fictitious element with atomic weight ( @xmath24 ) and atomic number ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "in contrast with our previous treatment , here @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the fictitious element are defined by the average @xmath24 and @xmath25 in each layer , and not assumed constant through different layers .",

    "the calculations presented here constitute the first grid of solar - metallicity white dwarf evolutionary sequences that include the effects of @xmath0ne sedimentation in a consistent way .",

    "this takes place during those stages of the evolution during which the white dwarf core is liquid , and is more relevant for massive white dwarfs , owing to their larger gravities .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have convincingly shown that the slow @xmath0ne sedimentation process releases enough energy to strongly alter the evolution of white dwarfs characterized by a high metal content in their interiors . here , we find that cooling times are substantially modified in the case of white dwarf with solar metallicity progenitors . this can be inferred from fig .",

    ", time delays range from 0.7 to 1.2  gyr , depending on the stellar mass ( see table [ tabladeltat ] ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that the oldest white dwarfs in the galactic disk are likely low metallicity , so the impact of @xmath0 ne sedimentation on those white dwarfs should be less relevant . also note that massive white dwarfs have larger gravities , and therefore @xmath0ne sedimentation is more effective . at low luminosities ,",
    "when the white dwarf crystallizes , @xmath0ne stops diffusing inwards through the solid phase , therefore the time delay stops growing .",
    "this is reflected in the curve of the right side panels , as it becomes constant after crystallization .",
    "time delays are slightly shorter in the @xmath43 white dwarf model than in the @xmath44 model , because more massive white dwarf crystallize at a higher luminosity , preventing @xmath0ne to keep diffusing . in summary ,",
    "@xmath0ne sedimentation , a process not considered in most existing grids of white dwarf evolutionary sequences used to date stellar populations , induces substantial delays in the cooling times of white dwarfs with solar metallicity progenitors .",

    "we defer these comparisons to future work .",
    "early estimates of the impact of @xmath0ne diffusion on the pulsation properties of zz  ceti stars was done by @xcite , who found that this process could change the period of the high radial order @xmath45modes by about 1 @xmath46 . in this section ,",
    "we perform a detailed analysis to provide a reliable assessment of the adiabatic pulsation properties of our white dwarf evolutionary models that take into account @xmath0ne diffusion .",
    "we compute pulsation periods in the range @xmath47  s corresponding to dipole ( @xmath48 ) @xmath15 modes .",

    "[ fig : fvb_057 ] for a selected @xmath49 white dwarf model at @xmath50 .",
    "for comparison purposes , we show in the upper panel the chemical stratification of the model .",
    "note that at this stage of the evolution , which corresponds to the domain of zz  ceti stars , element diffusion has markedly altered the initial @xmath0ne distribution in the star .",
    "in particular , it has strongly smoothed out the abrupt change of the @xmath0ne abundance at @xmath51 , and it has produced a bump in its abundance at @xmath52 .",
    "this bump is located at the tail of the helium distribution , where the average values of @xmath25 and @xmath24 grow inwards , leading to a change in the diffusion coefficients at those layers .",
    "in particular , the diffusion coefficients decrease inwards at that interface , thus @xmath0ne ions tend to accumulate .",
    "as the white dwarf evolves , this bump diffuses inwards .    in the middle and bottom panels of fig .",

    "has proceeded to the domain of the zz  ceti stars , @xmath0ne has diffused toward the central regions of the star , so the outer layers of the core have already been depleted of this element .",
    "this behavior turns out to be markedly more noticeable for larger gravities .",
    "this can be appreciated in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fvb_083 ] , which shows the chemical abundance distribution of a selected @xmath40 white dwarf model at @xmath29 .",

    "note in particular that the overabundance of @xmath0ne in the inner regions of the star leads to an increase of the density and therefore to a global increase in the brunt - visl frequency in those regions .",
    "the precise shape of the brunt - visl frequency largely determines the structure of the @xmath15-mode period spectrum . since this quantity is modified by the overabundance of the @xmath0ne in the inner regions of the star , particularly in massive white dwarfs , the value of the pulsation periods",
    "are thus expected to be affected when sedimentation of @xmath0ne is allowed to operate .",
    "this is demonstrated with the help of figs .",
    "[ fig : periods_057 ] and [ fig : periods_083 ] for the same models analyzed in the previous paragraph .",
    "the upper panel of each figure shows the @xmath57 pulsation periods , @xmath58 , as a function of the radial order @xmath59 .",
    "the middle and bottom panels illustrate , respectively , the difference in the periods induced by the sedimentation process of @xmath0ne , @xmath60 , and the forward period spacing , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the squared symbols ( in red ) correspond to the case when @xmath0ne sedimentation is considered and the cross symbols ( in black ) for the case in which diffusion is disregarded . in the case of the low - mass white dwarf model",
    ", the impact of @xmath0ne sedimentation on the pulsation periods is small and barely appreciable in the plot .",
    "the period differences , @xmath63 , between the models with and without @xmath0ne sedimentation in the range of the periods observed in zz  ceti stars ( from 100 to 1500  s ) are on average @xmath64  s , reaching values as high as @xmath65  s. although these differences are not large , they are still comparable to the typical average residual in model fits to the observed periods of pulsating white dwarfs ( @xmath66  s ) finally , the forward period spacing ( which is extremely sensitive to the precise shape of the chemical profiles ) also experiences a noticeable change when we take into account @xmath0ne sedimentation , as it is displayed in the bottom panel of this figure . in summary , the effects of @xmath0ne sedimentation on the pulsational properties of our model are appreciable for modes with very long periods ( high radial orders ) .",
    "however , we do not expect a large impact on the @xmath15-mode period spectrum of average - mass zz  ceti stars in the range of periods typically observed in these pulsating white dwarfs .",
    "the situation is quite different for the case of more massive white dwarfs , where @xmath0ne sedimentation becomes much more relevant .",
    "this can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ fig : periods_083 ] for a selected white dwarf model of our most massive sequence .",
    "now the differences in the theoretical periods that result from including @xmath0ne sedimentation are on average @xmath67  s , with values as high as @xmath68  s. these differences are , by far , much larger than the typical average residual in model fits to the observed periods of pulsating white dwarfs .",
    "the impact of considering @xmath0ne sedimentation on the forward period spacing is also noteworthy for this massive white dwarf model .",
    "note that the effects are larger for higher radial orders ( long periods ) .",
    "although our results show that @xmath0ne sedimentation affects the pulsation periods , it could still be difficult to infer its presence from a particular signature in the pulsation spectrum , since these differences may be mimicked by other changes in the models .",
    "the rate of period change , @xmath69 , which depends on the chemical composition of the core , is also affected by @xmath0ne sedimentation .",
    "this quantity is related to the rate of change in the temperature of the isothermal core ( @xmath70 ) through the equation : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are dimensionless constants of order unity depending on the equation of state , thicknesses of the hydrogen and helium layers , chemical composition , amongst others parameters @xcite . usually , for white dwarfs with hydrogen - rich atmospheres in the zz",
    "ceti instability strip the second term of the right hand side of equation [ pdot ] is negligible .",
    "the impact of considering @xmath0ne sedimentation on the rates of period change , at @xmath74 , is larger for the more massive white dwarf model ( @xmath40 ) than for the @xmath38 model . in the case of the more massive white dwarf model with @xmath75 ,",
    "the temporal rates of period change obtained by the calculations are , on average , @xmath76  s / s larger for the sequences that neglect @xmath0ne diffusion .",
    "this result was somehow expected since these sequences cool faster than the ones that include @xmath0ne diffusion . in the case of the @xmath77 white dwarf model with @xmath78 , no appreciable difference , on average , in the temporal rates of period change induced by @xmath0ne diffusion",
    "was obtained . at this point in the evolution ( @xmath79 ) , the rate of change in the temperature of the isothermal core is still not affected by the @xmath0ne sedimentation process ( see [ fig : delays ] ) .",
    "thus , no difference in @xmath69 is expected to occur as a consequence of this process .",
    "the sedimentation of @xmath0ne is a well established physical process that has been shown to be an important source of gravitational energy during the cooling of white dwarfs descending from metal - rich progenitor stars @xcite .",
    "the reason behind this is that the neutron excess that characterizes the @xmath0ne nucleus yields a net downward force and , consequently , in the liquid regions of the star @xmath0ne slowly diffuses towards the center of the white dwarf .",
    "observational evidence for the occurrence of @xmath0ne sedimentation in the liquid interior of white dwarfs has been provided by @xcite .",
    "however , most of the existing cooling sequences do not take this process into account .",
    "the only exceptions are the works of @xcite and @xcite , who calculated grids of evolutionary cooling sequences of white dwarfs descending from metal - rich progenitors , hence with high @xmath0ne abundances . in summary ,",
    "a realistic assessment of the delay caused by @xmath0ne sedimentation in the cooling of white dwarfs resulting from solar metallicity progenitors was lacking .",
    "although the role of @xmath0ne sedimentation becomes less relevant when the metal content of white dwarf progenitors is smaller , the effect of @xmath0ne diffusion on the cooling of white dwarfs with solar metallicity might not be entirely negligible @xcite . in this context , the aim of this paper was to provide a grid of cooling sequences for such white dwarfs incorporating for the first time the effect of @xmath0ne sedimentation .",
    "to this end , we computed the full evolution of 0.528 , 0.576 , 0.657 , and @xmath40 white dwarf models resulting from the complete evolution of progenitor stars of 1.0 , 1.5 , 3.0 and @xmath80 from the zams all the way through the phases of hydrogen and helium core burning to the thermally pulsing agb phase . in this way , our white dwarf cooling sequences incorporate realistic initial @xmath0ne profiles as dictated by nuclear burning history of the progenitor star . in addition , we computed @xmath0ne sedimentation using the most recent and reliable @xmath0ne diffusion coefficients @xcite .",
    "our computations also take into account all of the relevant energy sources , including latent heat and phase separation during crystallization .",
    "we found that @xmath0ne sedimentation leads to a substantial lengthening of the evolutionary times at low luminosities of white dwarfs resulting from solar metallicity progenitors .",
    "in particular , at @xmath81 , time delays range from 0.7 to 1.2 gyr , depending on the stellar mass .",
    "these delays in the cooling times are non negligible whatsoever . in fact , they are much longer than the uncertainties in white dwarf cooling times due to current uncertainties in the stellar microphysics .",
    "we extend the scope of the paper by investigating the impact of @xmath0ne sedimentation on the adiabatic pulsational properties of zz  ceti models . to this end",

    "has proceeded to the zz  ceti domain , element diffusion has notably altered the @xmath0ne distribution in the inner regions of the star .",
    "this has consequences for the brunt - visl frequency .",
    "in particular , for low - mass zz  ceti models we find that the period differences in the range of the periods observed in zz  ceti stars ( @xmath82  s ) are up to @xmath83  s. the rate of period change in low - mass zz  ceti models are not affected by @xmath0ne sedimentation process .",

    ", we find that differences in the theoretical periods that result from including @xmath0ne sedimentation reach values as high as @xmath84  s. the forward period spacings and the rate of period change are also affected .",
    "we conclude that @xmath0ne sedimentation is a relevant source of energy for white dwarfs resulting from solar metallicity progenitors , that should be taken into account in the computation of realistic cooling sequences for these stars , as well as in attempts to perform precise asteroseismology of zz  ceti stars . in particular , in the light of our findings , @xmath0ne sedimentation induces non - negligible changes in the pulsation periods and the period spacings of zz  ceti stars .",
