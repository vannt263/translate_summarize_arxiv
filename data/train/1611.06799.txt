    "<S> we use a chiral interaction at n3lo in the @xmath0 channel of the nucleon - nucleon interaction in order to investigate the on - shell transition along the similarity renormalization group flow towards the infrared limit . </S>",
    "<S> we find a crossover at a scale that depends on the number of grid points used to discretise the momentum space .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most appealing features of nature is universality . </S>",
    "<S> some phenomena disguise themselves across many different areas where physical systems are described by sometimes unrelated theories or models . yet they appear recurrently in some form .    </S>",
    "<S> an excellent example is the phase transition resulting from a broken symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed in magnetism when the temperature of a spin chain in a two - dimensional ising model crosses a critical value @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it appears in nuclear physics when observing rotational spectra of deformed nucleiit @xcite and it is also present in hadron physics when the coupling between quarks in a two - flavour njl model exceeds a critical value @xcite .    in both magnetism and nuclear physics </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition results from the breaking of the rotational symmetry and the corresponding goldstone bosons are spin waves and nuclear rotation . in hadron physics </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition results from the chiral symmetry breaking and the corresponding goldstone boson is the pion . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ trans ] for both two - dimensional ising model ( left ) and two - flavour njl model ( right ) .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we report on a similar and remarkable phase transition observed in the similarity renormalization group flow , which is used to change and calibrate the resolution scale of nuclear interactions to their natural values in different applications .        </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of an nn interaction with the srg @xcite is performed by numerically integrating the wegner renormalization group flow equation for the potential matrix @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the similarity cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> the flow equation generates a set of isospectral interactions that approaches a diagonal form as @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we explore the use of the frobenius norm ( fn ) of the potential as a measure of the on - shellness of the interaction in order to study the on - shell transition as the interaction undergoes the renormalization group flow through wegner s equation . for a real self - adjoint potential , @xmath6 the fn , @xmath7 , </S>",

    "<S> since we are interested in the infrared region of the similarity cutoff , we choose the n3lo chiral potential of entem and machleidt @xcite due to its short tail in momentum space which makes the srg evolution for @xmath5 more practical . in the case of the n3lo potential </S>",
    "<S> , we can work with a maximum momentum of @xmath11 and @xmath12 points for discretisation . </S>",
    "<S> this setup gives very reasonable values of the two - body contribution for the triton and helium binding energies as we approach typical values for the similarity cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> following our previous works @xcite , where a toy model for the nuclear force was used , we perform here the evolution of the n3lo potential in the range @xmath13 , generating a family of phase - equivalent effective potentials @xmath14 partially shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> our results indicate a crossover at a critical similarity cutoff @xmath18 approximately @xmath23 , below which we can consider the interaction to be on - shell . </S>",
    "<S> the usefulness of this observation is that in a system with a finite size , such as the atomic nucleus , where the momentum is naturally discretized , the on - shell limit is reached rather quickly . </S>",
