    "margulis  @xcite proved that the fundamental group of a flat lorentz manifold does not have to be virtually polycyclic , thus answering in the negative a question posed by milnor .",
    "milnor had asked whether auslander s conjecture , that every crystallographic group must be amenable , can be generalized to non - cocompact groups .",
    "margulis examples are affine groups whose linear parts are _ schottky groups _ : free , discrete groups such that every non - identity element is hyperbolic .",

    "while a group of isometries @xmath5 acts properly on the hyperbolic plane if it is discrete , a group of affine transformations whose linear part is @xmath5 might not act properly on @xmath0 , even though it acts freely .",
    "we are thus led to study _ affine deformations _ of a discrete group @xmath5 , which are groups of affine transformations whose linear part is @xmath5 .",

    ".    it has been conjectured by goldman - margulis that this necessary condition is also sufficient .",
    "an interesting , further question is , if the margulis invariant is positive for a finite set of elements in the group , can we deduce that the group must act properly on @xmath0 ?",
    "jones  @xcite proved that when @xmath8 is the fundamental group of a pair of pants , an affine deformation of the group @xmath9 acts properly and freely if and only if the margulis invariants of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 all have the same sign .",
    "this is achieved by showing that the translational parts assigned to @xmath13 and @xmath14 satisfy the drumm - goldman geometric condition .    in this paper , we show that jones result does not extend to the case when @xmath5 is the fundamental group of a punctured torus .",
    "we elaborate on a construction by drumm  @xcite , which gives examples of groups @xmath15 , where the margulis invariant for both @xmath10 and @xmath11 is positive , but is negative for @xmath12 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : main ] , stated below , describes examples of affine groups @xmath16 , with schottky linear part , such that :    * the margulis invariant of every word of length up to @xmath17 is positive ; * the margulis invariant of @xmath18 is negative .",
    "we can construct such counterexamples for every @xmath17 , with a fixed schottky linear part .",
    "recall that every hyperbolic isometry @xmath19 admits an attracting , future - pointing eigenvector ( of euclidean length one ) , which we denote by @xmath20 .",
    "the fundamental group of a punctured torus has the following interesting property . if @xmath21 is the fundamental group of a punctured torus , the set of vectors @xmath22 such that @xmath23 , for all @xmath24 , intersects non - trivially with the set of vectors @xmath22 such that @xmath25 .",

    "we apply some basic ideas of symbolic dynamics on the boundary of the hyperbolic plane ( see , for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "we show that there is a non - empty set of vectors @xmath22 , such that :    * @xmath26 ; * @xmath27 , for every word @xmath19 of length up to @xmath17 , except if the left factor of @xmath19 is of the form @xmath28 .",
    "this ensures that , choosing an appropriate factor of @xmath22 to be the translational part of @xmath10 , the margulis invariant is always positive , as long as there are no factors of the form @xmath28 .    in the second item",
    ", the case of words starting with @xmath28 poses a little bit of a difficulty , since the positioning of their eigenvectors potentially yield negative values of the margulis invariant for words of small length .",
    "however , we may impose a certain technical condition on @xmath21 , called _ property c _ ; roughly speaking , property c bounds the distance between the attracting eigenvector of @xmath29 and the attracting eigenvector of @xmath28 . in the addition formula for the margulis invariant , negative contributions from words of the form @xmath30 are then cancelled out by contributions from words of the form @xmath31 .",
    "property c thus ensures that the margulis invariant is positive for _ every _ word up to length @xmath17 .",
