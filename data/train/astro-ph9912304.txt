    "it is a mystery as to what powers the x - ray emission from transiently accreting neutron star and black hole binaries ( collectively referred to as soft x - ray transients , sxts ) when they are in their faint , quiescent state ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the cause of the bright outbursts is the sudden accretion of material that has accumulated in the outer disk , just as in the dwarf novae systems ( see for a recent discussion ) .",
    "while the majority of the sxt s containing neutron stars have been detected in quiescence , only three sxts that contain black holes have been detected :  @xcite , 404cyg@xcite , and  @xcite . while there is agreement that neutron stars ( ns ) are , on - average , brighter in quiescence than the black - hole candidates ( bhcs ) @xcite , the sources of the quiescent emission are still under debate .",
    "several possible mechanisms for the ns quiescent emission have been introduced , including accretion @xcite and magnetospheric emission from a turned - on radio pulsar @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical @xcite and observational work @xcite successfully attributes much of the quiescent luminosity of the transiently accreting nss to thermal emission from the ns surface .",
    "the repeated deposition of nuclear energy deep in the crust ( about 1 mev per accreted baryon ) during outbursts keeps the core of these accreting neutron stars hotter than their age would suggest @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of the thermal emission is then fixed by the time - averaged accretion rate  integrated over many outbursts  to be @xmath4  @xmath5 .",
    "the only emission mechanism available to the quiescent black hole is accretion .",
    "the puzzle of their emission mechanism began when rosat / pspc detected x - rays from  at a level @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "mcclintock et al . (",
    "1995 ) made it clear that this x - ray emission could not be due to a steady - state accretion disk around the black hole , as if so , there would be a production of optical and uv photons from the outer parts of the disk which would far exceed that observed .",
    "this puzzle can be solved with an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) , making it a commonly discussed energy source for the bhc quiescent x - ray emission @xcite . in this case , the x - rays are produced via compton up - scattering of the optical / uv synchrotron emission from the flow close to the black hole .",
    "these models much more successfully handle the ratio of optical / uv emission to x - ray emission , which is critical in evaluating their success (  [ sec : adaf ] ) .",
    "these models require large accretion rates in quiescence ; fully a third of the mass transfer rate in the binary ( see for a discussion ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the alternative hypothesis that some or all of the quiescent x - ray emission from the bhcs originates from the active corona of the rapidly rotating and convective stellar companion .",
    "coronal x - ray emission from the companion star has not been examined in any detail previously .",
    "mcclintock et al . (",
    "1995 ) concluded that the x - ray luminosity of coronally active stars was too low to explain bh sxt emission ( @xmath7  ) , referring to a comparison between the x - ray luminosity of cvs and unevolved k dwarfs in the pleiades made by eracleous @xcite .",
    "however , the more analogous systems are tidally locked ( and slightly evolved ) stars in tight binaries , such as the rs  cvn and algol systems . these have x - ray luminosities from coronal activity that can reach  @xcite . the analogy between quiescent bhcs and the rs cvn binaries",
    "was further noted by verbunt ( 1996 ) , and we confirm his initial findings about the x - ray emission .",
    "in   [ sec : rscvn ] , we briefly discuss coronal x - ray production in other tidally locked binaries , making it clear what level of x - ray emission is possible from the sxt companion stars .",
    "we find that the x - ray emission from two (  and ) of the three detected bhcs is consistent with coronal emission , while one bhc ( 404cyg ) and all ns systems are too bright to be explained with coronal emission from the companion .",
    "the implications this has for future x - ray observations are discussed in  [ sec : futxray ] .",
    "possible radio and/or optical confirmation of the coronal hypothesis is discussed in ",
    "[ sec : implications ] .",
    "when first noting the prominent li absorption line in the sxt 404cyg , wallerstein @xcite considered the hypothesis that li was overabundant as in an rs cvn binary . though he discarded it because he estimated the li to be too abundant , we feel this was premature .",
    "our investigations into coronal indicators find that the lithium detected in many of the sxt companions is likely from coronal activity , thus eliminating the need for exotic mechanism having to do with the compact object .",
    "we conclude in   [ sec : conclude ] and mention a few tests for coronal x - ray emission in these systems .",
    "we also outline the implications our work has for the general picture of accretion in quiescence in the sxts .",
    "the level of coronal activity for stars with outer convective zones strongly depends on the stellar rotation rate ( see ) .",
    "the simplest dynamo picture requires rotation and a radiative layer underneath the convective zone .",
    "this naturally occurs in late - type main sequence stars ( spectral types f through m ) where the accumulated x - ray observations point to the ratio of soft x - ray to bolometric luminosities ( @xmath8 ) saturating at a level of @xmath9 @xcite toward short rotation periods ( 1 day ) @xcite .",
    "this saturation level decreases for rotation periods longer than a few days and appears to be independent of stellar age @xcite .",
    "the inevitable slowing of isolated stars with age means that high levels of activity can best be maintained for long times via tidal locking in a tight binary .",
    "the common systems that result are the rs cvn , algol and by dra type binaries ; many of which are prevalent x - ray sources in old open clusters , such as m67 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray properties of rs cvns were surveyed by dempsey @xcite , who found 112 such objects in the _ rosat _  all - sky survey .",
    "they found that most rapidly rotating ( less than ten days ) late type dwarfs exhibit @xmath10 , with some systems exceeding the @xmath11 level that vilhu and walter @xcite had denoted previously as a possible `` saturation '' limit .",
    "dempsey et al .",
    "@xcite found much the same x - ray properties for the by draconis dwarf - type binaries .",
    "the companion stars in the sxts are also rapidly rotating through tidal locking and have rotation rates and spectral types similar to these active systems @xcite .",
    "this amplifies the need to carefully assess the likelihood that a significant part of the observed soft x - ray emission in these binaries is from coronal activity .",
    "we start by making the simplest comparison between the sxt companions and the active binaries , which is the ratio of the x - ray to bolometric flux , .",
    "this _ distant - independent _ quantity immediately tells us which sxts could possibly have substantial x - ray emission from active coronae .",
    "the sxts we analyze are the optically identified , spectroscopically typed sxts with low quiescent luminosities (  ; ) .",
    "this gives us eight bhcs : , , , , , ,  and 404cyg ; and four nss : , 4 , 1608 , and 2129 .",
    "here , we give the details of measuring  for the sxts . to obtain x - ray fluxes in the _ rosat_/pspc passband ( 0.4 - 2.4 kev ) for comparison with coronal sources , we re - fit x - ray data from our previous studies of these objects @xcite , and converted the upper - limit fluxes for those we had not previously analyzed ( specifically ,  and ) using w3pimms . for the fits , we assume all the x - ray emission is from the stellar corona , and use a raymond - smith plasma plus galactic absorption column , as implemented in xspec v10.0 @xcite , with solar - abundance , and holding the column density ( =/ [ ] ) fixed at the values we previously adopted for each source , except where noted .",

    "the bhc data we analyse here are of low signal to noise . for example ,  has only 45 + /-",
    "9 counts . binned into 3 pha spectral bins , these data can be adequately fit with nearly any model ( power - law , blackbody , bremmstrahlung ) .",
    "it is our present goal to only interpret the x - ray flux as from a stellar corona , which motivates our selection and application of a raymond - smith plasma model .",
    "the current data do not allow us to test the hypothesis based on the spectral fits .",
    "these data have been previously analysed in a wide range of models , and we refer the interested reader of the results of such analyses to those studies ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "after measuring the unabsorbed x - ray flux  ( 0.4 - 2.4 kev ) , we also find the bolometric luminosity of the stellar companion @xmath13",
    "@xcite , where @xmath14 is the quiescent magnitude , @xmath15 is a correction due to the non - stellar continuum ( see  [ sec : adaf ] for a discussion ) , b.c . is the bolometric correction for the measured spectral type , and  is the reddening .    to estimate @xmath15",
    "we examined all previous measurements of the fraction ( @xmath16 ) of the optical continuum that is not from the stellar companion ( see table  [ tab : f ] ) .",
    "these measurements were taken in different passbands , from different objects , often using different techniques and at different times , some with and others without error estimation .",
    "the vast majority are @xmath1750% .",
    "four measurements of the @xmath1830 we list are above this and we therefore consider a @xmath19% flux contribution to be exceptional ( the data of is the same as ) . note especially the values by orosz @xcite for  and @xcite for , which indicate a time - variable @xmath16 .",
    "while it would be highly preferable to apply individual  and more precise  estimates of this contribution for the individual sources , such contributions must be measured simultaneously with the photometric measurement , due to the observed time - variability of @xmath16 , and these are generally not available .",
    "we adopt @xmath20 , which includes a conservative uncertainty for this correction . aside from uncertainty in disk contribution",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in @xmath21 to be dominated by uncertainty in the b.c . and @xmath22 . our ( conservative ) uncertainties in the b.c .",
    "are found from the effect of the uncertainty of the companion s spectral type on the assumed b.c .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath14 are small compared to these , so we neglect them .",
    "we use the following conversions : @xmath23 , @xcite ; = 0.179 @xmath24@xmath25 @xcite .",

    "however , they did not report the flux for this component and so we can not compare it to the typical levels seen in other interacting binaries ( @xmath71 ; ) . from our estimate of @xmath21 , and assuming rotational broadening of 50 km , this works out to 0.6 - 3  @xmath72 .",
    "this is comparable to the flux observed in a variable single - peaked h@xmath66 emission line , super - imposed on a double - peaked line  present in july , 1994 , but absent in may , 1993 @xcite .",
    "however , variability in rs cvn h@xmath66 emission at this level has not been reported .    finally , we note that c iv has been observed in the uv spectra of rs  cvn sources , correlated with x - ray emission @xcite . there are no reported c iv lines of sxts in the literature , although it would seem that they should be present",
    ".      nearly all optical observations in quiescence find evidence for excess optical / uv light over and above that from the companion ( see for a recent example , and table 2 ) .",
    "the most commonly invoked source of this emission is an outer disk that is truncated at some finite inner radius in order to avoid over producing uv and x - ray emission .",
    "however , the advent of the adaf models for the quiescent x - ray emission has modified this story , as the synchrotron emission from the inner parts of the adaf flow can possibly explain the observed optical excess @xcite .",
    "in these models , the x - rays are made via comptonization of the synchrotron photons from deeper in the flow .",
    "indeed , an advantage of the adaf models ( which ca nt _ a priori _ predict the x - ray flux ) is their ability to predict the ratio of the optical to the x - ray emission in a nearly model independent way .",
    "we begin by summarizing the state of modeling for 404cyg , as coronal emission appears unlikely to explain its quiescent x - ray emission .",
    "the current best set of adaf models @xcite simultaneously fit the quiescent excess optical and x - ray emission from 404cyg .",
    "the required mass transfer rate in the quiescent adaf flow is comparable to the total mass transfer rate in the binary , implying the incoming material from the companion is shared between the hot advective flow and accumulation in the outer disk .",
    "all of the excess optical / uv emission is explained as synchrotron emission from the adaf , and is emitted within a few tens of schwarzschild radii of the @xmath73 black hole .",
    "the outer cool disk makes no contribution to the total excess emission in this model .",
    "how do the adaf models fare when a substantial part of the x - ray emission comes from the corona of the companion ?",
    "the optical / uv excess from a 0620 - 00 is well measured , and adaf modeling that fit the x - ray data over - predicted the optical / uv emission by factors as large as four @xcite .",
    "this conflict is alleviated if some of the observed x - rays are from the stellar corona , as then the adaf contribution can be reduced to explain the optical / uv excess . in that case , the stellar corona and adaf x - ray emission are comparable .    an alternative picture would be to explain all the bhc x - ray emission as coronal and the optical / uv excess as from a truncated outer disk .",
    "this situation seems likely for gro j1655 - 40 , as the current adaf models that fit the x - ray data under - predict the optical / uv excess @xcite .",
    "this system might best be explained with all x - ray emission coming from the stellar corona .",
    "indeed , the detailed modeling by orosz & bailyn @xcite of the excess optical emission exclusively in terms of an outer disk was successful and required no adaf flow .",
    "we have shown that two (  and ) of the three x - ray detected black hole binaries exhibit x - ray fluxes entirely consistent with coronal emission from the companion star .",
    "the upper limits on the remaining bhcs are also consistent with production via chromospheric activity in the secondary . in addition",
    ", we found that the photospheric lithium content measured for many of the sxt companions is typical for coronally active stars .",
    "we therefore conclude that the quiescent x - ray emission from all but one bhc might be due to coronal emission from the companion star .",
    "there are many ways to confirm the chromospheric hypothesis .",
    "the most straightforward is x - ray spectroscopy of the bhcs in quiescence with _",
    "chandra_and _ xmm - newton_. resolving the soft ( 0.2 - 2.0 kev ) x - ray emission into the coronal line emission common for chromospheric emission would be strong confirmation .",
    "however , the calculated equivalent widths make their detection quite difficult @xcite .",
    "additional means of confirming the chromospheric hypothesis is analysis of the ca ii h&k absorption lines , the `` re - filling '' of which is correlated with the x - ray chromospheric surface flux @xcite ; or from similar analysis of the ca ii infra - red triplet , as performed by dempsey  @xcite .",
    "radio emission ( 5 - 8 ghz ) observed from coronally active stars is correlated with x - ray luminosity ; consistency between the @xmath74 of bhcs and that observed from coronally active stars would support the interpretation of the x - rays as due to stellar coronal activity .",
    "coronal variability from flares ( which occur roughly 40% of the time in rs cvn systems ; ) requires that such observations be carried out simultaneously in the x - ray and radio frequencies .",
    "not all quiescent sxt x - ray emission can be explained as coronal activity in the companion .",
    "the quiescent x - ray flux from the bhc 404cyg  is a factor of ten brighter than can be explained as coronal emission and all four nss ( , 4 , 1608 , 2129 ) have quiescent x - ray luminosities which are at least ten times greater than expected from chromospheric emission alone . as noted in the introduction , much of the quiescent x - ray emission from the ns systems is naturally explained as thermal emission from the ns @xcite .    however , accretion power is the only choice for the unambiguous black hole candidate 404cyg .",
    "the current adaf modeling requires accretion rates in quiescence of order @xmath75 , a large fraction of the mass transfer rate in the binary .",
    "quiescent accretion rates _ at least three orders of magnitude lower _ may be needed to explain the observed variability in some of the quiescent nss ( a factor of 4.20.5 in 8 days from 4 ; and in 4u  2129 + 47 , by a factor of 3.40.6 between nov - dec 1992 and march 1994 ; ) .",
    "there is no simple reason why these accretion rates should be so different , although some scenarios have been investigated @xcite .",
    "much of the current debate about the role of accretion as a power source in quiescence centers around understanding what fraction of the continuous flow into the outer disk ( which makes itself apparent via excess continuum emission and broad , double - peaked @xmath76 lines ) accumulates there ( for the next outburst ) versus proceeding all the way into the compact object .",
    "the adaf modeling of the bhcs require that the incoming flow is about evenly split , whereas the much more severe limits on quiescent accretion for the ns systems says that 99.9% of the accreted matter does not find its way to the compact object .",
    "the observational situation is clearly in a state of flux .",
    "the upcoming x - ray observations of the previously detected sxts will sort out the emission sources via x - ray spectral information , rather than just total fluxes .",
    "it might be that all sxt s have variable accretion rates in quiescence and that the basal quiescent x - ray flux is set by either coronal emission from the companion or  when present  by thermal emission from the neutron star .",
