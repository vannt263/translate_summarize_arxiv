    ". calculated values for some materials using eq.([ecoh ] ) are compared with experimental values@xcite in table._1_. also we compare the energy per particle vs volume curve of aluminum with the data obtained from ab - initio calculations@xcite in fig.([1 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that there is a serious mismatch between the two . however from fig.([1 ] ) , we can notice that the slopes of the mglj eos and that of the ab - initio curve are similar which is the reason for pressure calculated from mglj eos being accurate .",

    "it can be seen that thermodynamic properties calculated using mglj potential with parameters of sun diverge for materials with @xmath19 is less than @xmath0 .",
    "for example , consider the excess internal energy per particle ( @xmath27 ) obtained through the energy equation@xcite .",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29 is the density of the system and @xmath30 is the radial distribution function .",
    "since @xmath30 becomes @xmath31 asymptotically , the integral requires that each term of @xmath32 decays faster than @xmath33 .",
    "however , if @xmath19 is less than @xmath0 , the attractive component of @xmath32 decays slower than @xmath33 allowing @xmath27 in eq.([ee ] ) to diverge and for most of the materials @xmath19 is less than @xmath0 .",
    "this renders the potential , as parameterized by sun , to be inapplicable to calculate thermodynamic properties as they involve evaluation of integrals similar to eq.([ee ] ) .",
    "also the potential can not be used in molecular simulations as the tail correction for internal energy is similar to eq.([ee ] ) with lower limit being replaced by the cutoff radius of the potential .",
    "we noted that the mglj eos predicts cohesive energies erroneously .",
    "also we showed that the mglj potential can not be used in liquid state theories and molecular simulations for materials with @xmath34 less than @xmath0 as the thermodynamic quantities calculated using it diverge .",
