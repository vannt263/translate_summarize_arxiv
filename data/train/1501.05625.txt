    "* hereafter at13 ) recently reported the discovery of a li - rich red giant ( rg ) star in ngc 6819 .",
    "this star , 2m19411367 + 4003382 , has @xmath3(li)@xmath4  dex ( [ li / h]@xmath51.3 ) and is unusual even within the class of rare li - rich giants .",
    "the star s current position on a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) suggests that it has evolved beyond the li dilution phase of first dredge - up ( fdu ) , and , indeed , the other ngc  6819 rgs at similar magnitudes have @xmath3(li)@xmath6  dex ( at13 ) .",
    "what makes this li - rich star so unusual is that its cmd position is clearly below and blueward of the luminosity bump , the evolutionary stage where models have demonstrated that newly synthesized li can be circulated to the stellar envelope , resulting in a brief stage of li - richness ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , hereafter d12 ) .",
    "other recent studies ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) have identified li - rich stars in the field that are too hot to be bump stars .",
    "the former study hypothesized that these stars are red clump ( rc ) stars that replenished li during the he flash , and the low @xmath0c/@xmath1c  of many of these stars are consistent with internal li regeneration .",
    "the latter study favored planetary engulfment because their stars tend to be more rapidly rotating and have @xmath0c/@xmath1c  near normal fdu values .",
    "the currently favored model for 2m19411367 + 4003382  is the mixing model of d12 , which can explain li - rich giants below the luminosity bump .",
    "in addition to enriching the surface with li , the mixing alters the star s evolution , making it follow a more extended `` retrograde '' evolutionary path down the red giant branch ( rgb ) compared to normal luminosity bump evolution . in the discovery paper , at13 argued that 2m19411367 + 4003382 s li abundance and position on the rgb was most consistent with this model , but they also noted that a crucial test of this hypothesis is the measurement of @xmath0c/@xmath1c  to confirm whether the extra mixing has indeed occurred .    what makes 2m19411367 + 4003382  such a powerful test of li - regeneration hypotheses is its apparent membership in an open cluster , which allows a direct comparison of its abundances to other stars of nearly identical evolution .",
    "however , its membership is not conclusively established .",
    "its radial velocity ( rv ) , original proper motion measurement @xcite , color , and magnitude ( e.g , at13 ) support membership ( see figure  [ fig : membership ] ) , but its asteroseismic properties @xcite and more recently measured proper motion @xcite support non - membership . both of these non - membership criteria have caveats .",
    "@xcite reported that stars with high rv membership probabilities but low proper motion membership probabilities tend to have larger proper motion errors that stars of similar brightness .",
    "this suggests that there may have been confusion in the star s identification on the photographic plates .",
    "the asteroseismic properties of the li - rich star suggest a lower @xmath2 and mass than expected for cluster membership , but they yield a luminosity that places the star near the distance of the cluster .",
    "( these caveats are discussed in more detail in section [ sec : case2 ] ) .    in this paper , we use high - resolution , infrared spectra to address questions on the li - rich star s cluster membership and evolutionary status .",
    "we select three similarly evolved comparison rgs in ngc 6819 ( section [ sec : comps ] ) and measure abundances of ten elements in the li - rich star and comparison stars ( section [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "we measure a spectroscopic @xmath2 , and find that it is consistent with the asteroseismic @xmath2 ( section [ sec : gravity ] ) .",
    "the apogee spectra also reveal that the li - rich star is rotating slightly more rapidly than the other rgs ( section [ sec : vsini ] ) .",
    "we combine our data and literature resources to consider possible contamination from companions or unrelated background sources ( section [ sec : binary ] ) .",
    "finally , we explore the implications of these results under the two possible cases of cluster membership ( section [ sec : overview ] ) and summarize our findings ( section [ sec : end ] ) .     marks the rv of the li - rich star.[fig : membership],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   marks the rv of the li - rich star.[fig : membership],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    lcccc 2mass & 2m19411367 + 4003382 & 2m19404965 + 4014313 & 2m19412222 + 4016442 &",

    "we performed multiple checks of whether our spectroscopic analysis is affected by either a companion to the li - rich star or an unrelated fore / background object .",
    "first , we fit model spectral energy distributions ( sed ) to photometry spanning optical @xcite , near - ir ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",

    "the best results are obtained for a bare photosphere with a hotter temperature ( @xmath7@xmath73  k ) than that derived from our @xmath36 calibration and a larger line - of - sight extinction .",
    "this solution implies that the li - rich star is a more distant star affected by additional extinction .",
    "however , the analysis favors the largest extinction we allowed in the fit , @xmath74 , which is slightly higher than @xmath75 , the extinction in the @xcite map at this position .",
    "additionally , the same sed analysis of the most similar comparison star also favors a hotter , more reddened solution .",

    "a second round cross - correlations used the todcor algorithm @xcite to generate a two - dimensional cross - correlation using a wide range of possible secondary spectral types : no significant secondary peaks were identified .",
    "we conclude that the spectral absorption features are truly arising in the red giant s atmosphere and are not significantly contaminated by flux from any binary companion or unassociated blend .",
    "our analysis of the li - rich star has confirmed that it is evolved  its low @xmath2 and non - solar c / n are consistent with the picture of a rg that has undergone fdu and should have depleted li .",
    "however , given the uncertainties in the cluster membership , the li - rich star may be a more massive , more luminous background rg that coincidentally shares the same rv , [ fe / h ] , and cmd locus as the cluster .",
    "therefore , to fully explore the implications of our measurements we provide two scenarios .",
    "the first scenario presumes that the li - rich star is not a member of ngc  6819 , and we explore how that assumption changes our derived abundances , @xmath2 , etc .",
    "the second scenario explores the implications of the star being a cluster member , and we demonstrate why we favor this scenario .        if the li - rich star is not a member of the cluster , then the temperature derived from the @xmath77 is a lower limit , since the reddening may be underestimated .",
    "we can test how our analysis will change if we adopt the total line - of - sight reddening observed in the direction of 2m19411367 + 4003382 . if we adopt @xmath74 ( the preferred solution of the sed fitting ) , then @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "reapplying our temperature calibration yields 4840  k. the strong temperature dependence of lines increases @xmath3 ( ) , while remains nearly constant .",
    "thus , the ionization equilibrium plot ( figure  [ fig : ti ] ) for @xmath80  k would have a similar shape , but the horizontal line would shift upwards by @xmath81  dex and intersect the @xmath3 ( ) line at @xmath82 and @xmath3(ti)@xmath83  dex .",
    "this means that if the li - rich star is in indeed a background red giant , then its surface gravity is higher than that predicted by the asteroseismology and matches that expected from the stellar isochrones .    since the li - rich star has the same metallicity as the confirmed cluster stars , we can adopt solar metallicity stellar evolution tracks @xcite to find the range of masses and ages of stars near this @xmath7 and @xmath2 but that have luminosities exceeding that adopted in table  [ tab : stars ] under the assumption of cluster membership .",
    "we find that stars within @xmath84  k , @xmath85  dex , and @xmath86 span a mass range of 1.83.0  @xmath42  and an age range of 0.41.6  gyr",

    ".      we can use mixing signatures to explore whether internal replenishment of li is a viable mechanism for the full range of possible masses and ages of the li - rich star .",
    "constraints on these stellar parameters were made in the last section for the high extinction case , but we must also consider the case where the li - rich star is affected by the same amount of extinction as the cluster stars , i.e. , if there is negligible extinction between the cluster and the li - rich star .",
    "we repeat the analysis with stellar evolution tracks for @xmath87  k , @xmath88  dex , and @xmath86 .",
    "the resulting mass range is @xmath894.0  @xmath42  and an age range of 0.21.6  gyr . in this scenario , both first and second ascent evolutionary stages for the full mass range",
    "are consistent with the selection criteria . as a result ,",
    "1.8  @xmath42  stars near the cool end of our @xmath7 range ( 4620  k ) are luminosity bump stars that also meet the gravity and luminosity constraint .    in",
    "either assumed extinction scenario , the li - rich star is an evolved giant that should have undergone convective dilution and show depleted li .",
    "the allowed parameters of the li - rich star includes two regimes where li regeneration has been suggested to occur  the luminosity bump , and the narrow mass range of rc stars identified by @xcite . thus , internal li regeneration seems to be a viable explanation .",
    "however , a common feature of internal li regeneration models is that the li synthesis must happen deep enough in the star that whatever mechanism is ferrying the newly synthesized li into the convection zone must also ferry @xmath1c and thereby lower the surface @xmath0c/@xmath1c .",
    "the absence of strong @xmath1c features excludes the deep mixing that should accompany li - regeneration via the d12 models favored by at13 , unless we are observing the star near the beginning of the rapid li enrichment stage ( in which the star spends less than a few myr with enriched li but fdu levels of @xmath0c/@xmath1c ) .",

    "we used the mesa stellar evolution code @xcite to generate limiting mass models of @xmath97 and 4.0  @xmath42  to determine the amount of mass in the outer convection zone for stars near 4700 and 4840  k at different phases of the rgb evolution . in all cases ,",
    "that mass was at least 1.1  @xmath42 .",
    "consequently , the amount of material required to explain the enhanced li in 2m19411367 + 4003382   is 0.1  @xmath42 , which is a stellar mass companion . such a low mass companion would have been missed by our binary analysis .",
    "however , low mass stars are also li depleted .",
    "substellar companions retain their birth supply of li , but they are too low mass unless they are significantly enriched in li over the solar nebular value .",
    "the inferences on the origin of the excess li mentioned in the previous section are valid in the case of cluster membership , but we place further constraints on the unusual nature of the li - rich star if it is truly a cluster member . the cluster membership is supported from a number of lines of evidence . its rv is consistent with membership , and its optical and infrared magnitudes coincide with the cluster s cmd locus . this latter piece of evidence is further supported by the fact that the temperature we derived from the 2mass colors is the same as that derived by the aspcap pipeline ( see section [ sec : comps ] ) .",
    "the aspcap pipeline fits model spectra to the continuum - normalized observed spectrum and is , importantly , independent of any assumption of reddening .",
    "therefore , the aspcap temperature verifies that the reddening of the li - rich star is the same as the rest of the cluster and thus shares the temperature and magnitude of the cluster s isochrone",
    ".      one of the major pieces of evidence against membership for the li - rich star is that @xcite find proper motions inconsistent with membership .",
    "however , the authors of that paper noted that finding low proper motion membership probabilities for stars with high rv membership probabilities is likely due to source confusion ( see their figure 6 ) .",
    "in fact , an earlier proper motion study @xcite gave the li - rich star ( star 90 in that paper ) a 90% membership probability .",
    "an inspection of a digitized sky surveys ( dss ) optical blue image and the 2mass @xmath98-band image in figure  [ fig : image ] reveals an elongation in the optical dss image that is not present in the @xmath98-band image .",
    "this is suggestive of a faint , blue source .",
    "if this source is visible in the plates used by @xcite , or worse is only visible in some of the plates , it could shift the apparent photocenter of the li - rich star and skew the proper motion measurement .",
    "star 90 on the @xcite plate is very round , suggesting that the nearby blue source is too faint to adversely affect the earlier proper motion measurement .",
    "indeed , the @xmath99 limit of the @xcite plate is quoted as @xmath100  mag , whereas the magnitude limits of the plates used in @xcite are @xmath10122  mag . because this visual companion is faint and blue",

    "[ fig : image],scaledwidth=50.0% ]      cluster membership adds more problems to both the internal and external replenishment models . as a cluster member ,",
    "the evolutionary stage of the li - rich star is clearly below the luminosity bump , which led a13 to favor the recent d12 models .",
    "however , there is a discrepancy between the d12 models and the li - rich star s cmd position .",
    "d12 s model predicts an evolution that traces an extended luminosity bump - like zigzag on the cmd . unlike the luminosity bump , the extended zigzag in the d12 models",

    "the other cluster rgs provide a revised estimate for pre - engulfment @xmath3(li ) , which is lower than that estimated in section [ sec : external ] . additionally , with a well known evolutionary stage",
    ", we can more accurately pinpoint a mesa model to estimate the size of the convection zone . using the 1.7  @xmath42  mesa run , we inspected the internal profiles for four evolutionary stages on the first ascent rgb near @xmath104  k. in all cases , there is @xmath105  @xmath42  in the convective envelope , requiring 0.15  @xmath42  of accreted material to explain the observed @xmath3(li ) .",
    "another implication of the cluster membership is that it allows us to put stronger credence on the asteroseismology result , since our spectroscopic @xmath2 agrees with the asteroseismic @xmath2 . the scaling relations for @xmath18 and @xmath20 can both be cast to depend only on @xmath7 , @xmath106 , and either @xmath107 or @xmath108 . since @xmath7   is accurately known and has the weakest influence on @xmath18 and @xmath20 , the remaining quantities can be derived without any other assumptions .",
    "these results are given in the bottom section of table  [ tab : stars ] .",

    "this analysis places the li - rich star at roughly the distance of the cluster but with a mass of only 0.7  @xmath42 , which explains the `` low '' @xmath2 .",
    "the main sequence lifetime of such a low mass star exceeds the age of the universe .",
    "if this mass is correct , the most plausible explanation is that the star lost a significant fraction of its mass , and we suggest that this mass loss is related to the source of li .",
    "furthermore , this low mass does not nullify the cmd position as evidence of cluster membership .",
    "the luminosity of stars with h - burning shells is dictated by the mass of the stellar core , leading to a core mass - luminosity relationship .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that this relationship holds for intermediate mass stars and that the total mass has a negligible effect on this relationship .",
    "thus , if the li - rich star began its life with the same mass as the other rgs and only lost mass recently , it should have the same core mass as the other rgs .",
    "the case for enrichment by an external source of @xmath3(li )  is much more feasible if the star is really 0.7  @xmath42",
    ". we can again adopt @xmath3(li )  @xmath6  dex for the pre - engulfment abundance and use the mesa models of the 1.7  @xmath42  star . if an engulfed companion strips 1  @xmath42  of material from the star before it disperses into the remaining stellar envelope , then the remaining envelope is only 0.4  @xmath42 .",
    "since the star is not entirely stripped of the original convective envelope , the mass loss not does extend deep enough to expose material with low @xmath0c/@xmath1c .",
    "only a 45@xmath109 object is required to enrich @xmath3(li )  up to the observed value .",
    "this mass is safely in the substellar companion regime of objects , which retain their birth @xmath3(li ) .",
