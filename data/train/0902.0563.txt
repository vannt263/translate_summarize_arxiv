    "hera , running from 1992 until 2007 , was the only electron - proton ( @xmath0 ) collider in the world , providing head - on collision data for two multi - purpose detectors , h1 and zeus .",
    "studies of neutral current ( nc , @xmath5 , mediated by @xmath6 and @xmath7 bosons ) and charged current ( cc , @xmath8 , mediated by @xmath9 bosons ) deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes , performed by both collaborations , allowed for a substantial increase in the understanding of pqcd and parton density functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "first analyses using the full luminosity of @xmath10 are about to be finalized .",
    "this paper points to the most recent measurements of the @xmath2 and @xmath4 structure functions , as well as to the first combination of reduced @xmath11 cross sections measured separately by h1 and zeus and to common qcd pdf fits , resulting in much more precise picture of the structure of the proton .",
    "the kinematics of dis can be described using three variables : the momentum transfer , @xmath1 , the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath12 and the inelasticity , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the center - of - mass collision energy squared ) .",

    "the h1 and zeus collaborations have both used their data to perform reduced cross section and @xmath3 measurements as well as nlo qcd pdf fits @xcite @xcite .",
    "as these measurements are limited by systematic effects , both data sets have now been combined ( fig  [ fig : pdfs ] left ) using a theory - free hessian fit such , that both experiments calibrate each other @xcite .",
    "this results in a common data set with reduced systematic uncertainties , which is then used as input to the herapdf0.1 fit ( fig  [ fig : pdfs ] right ) .",
    "the new pdfs @xcite are of impressive precision as compared to the fit of each dataset alone , as well as to the global parton analyses @xcite @xcite .     as a function of @xmath1 at different @xmath12 values .",

    "the structure function @xmath27 is obtained from the difference of @xmath28 ( from previous data ) and @xmath29 scattering cross sections ( fig .  [ fig : fl ] left ) .",
