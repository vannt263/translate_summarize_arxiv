    "recent deep _ chandra _  observations of the inner 9  around the super - massive black hole at the galactic center have revealed over 2000 individual point - like x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "the sources have luminosities between @xmath5 and @xmath6  erg s@xmath1 ( for a distance of 8 kpc to the galactic center ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus they probably represent some combination of young stellar objects , wolf - rayet and early o stars , interacting binaries ( rs cvns ) , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , young pulsars , and black holes and neutron stars accreting from binary companions ( low- and high - mass x - ray binaries ; lmxbs and hmxbs ) . however , the spectra of the galactic center sources are very hard in the energy range of 28 kev .",
    "spectra that are similarly hard have only been observed previously from magnetically accreting cvs ( mcvs ) and hmxb pulsars .",
    "moreover , seven of the hard sources exhibit x - ray modulations with periods between 300  s and 4.5  h , which also suggests that they are magnetized white dwarfs or neutron stars @xcite .",
    "these basic observations are a good first step toward determining the natures of the point sources . however ,",
    "if their natures can be determined conclusively , the large number of sources in the field would make it possible to study two important pieces of astrophysics : ( 1 ) the history of star formation at the galactic center , and ( 2 ) the physics of x - ray production in accreting stellar remnants .",
    "how stars form at the galactic center is still a mystery , because the strong tidal forces and milligauss magnetic fields there should prevent all but the most massive molecular clouds from collapsing .",
    "nonetheless , it appears that star formation has occurred recently , because three massive stellar clusters younger than @xmath7 years old lie within @xmath8  pc of the galactic center : irs 16 , the arches , and the quintuplet @xcite .",
    "however , it is still a matter of debate as to whether the star formation is continuous or episodic , and whether it occurs only in localized regions or is relatively uniform throughout the galactic center .",
    "@xcite addressed this question by modeling the evolution of the population of luminous infrared stars , and concluded that the star formation is probably continuous .",
    "the x - ray sources at the galactic center could provide an additional , independent constraint on the star formation history there , because they should be dominated by accreting stellar remnants .",
    "the size of the sample of x - ray sources  an order of magnitude larger than the numbers of known lmxbs , hmxbs , and magnetic cvs  also makes it a valuable database for studying the physics of x - ray production .",
    "several outstanding questions could be addressed with the current data .",
    "if the sample contains large numbers of magnetic cvs , it could be used to determine the duty cycle of bright accretion states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the fraction of such systems that exhibit hard spectral components ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if there is a significant number of neutron star hmxbs , it may be possible to determine whether material accreted at rates far below the eddington limit can penetrate the neutron star s magnetosphere and reach its surface @xcite .",
    "finally , the large sample of galactic center x - ray sources would be useful for identifying systems with unusual properties .",
    "previous hard x - ray surveys of the galactic plane have identified several slowly - rotating accreting neutron stars and white dwarfs @xcite , magnetic cvs with extremely strong emission lines from he - like fe @xcite , and accreting stellar remnants with high intrinsic absorption @xcite .",
    "these systems could represent resting points for stellar remnants that have not been observed previously , and are therefore important for calculating the formation rate of such remnants in the galaxy .    in this paper",
    ", we take a further step toward the above goals by using the properties of the x - ray emission from the point sources near the galactic center @xcite to constrain better their natures . in sections 2.12.3 ,",
    "we examine the spectra of the point sources both individually and averaged together , in order to determine the temperatures of the emitting regions . in section 2.4 , we search for short - term variability , which is often seen from coronal x - ray sources , and long - term variability , which is common in some accreting x - ray sources . in section  3 ,",
    "we compare the properties of the observed sources with those of known classes of x - ray source .",
    "finally , in section  4 , we briefly explore the future prospects for definitively identifying the natures of these sources .",
    "twelve separate pointings toward the galactic center have been carried out using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer imaging array ( acis - i ) aboard the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite in order to monitor  ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the acis - i is a set of four 1024-by-1024 pixel ccds , covering a field of view of 17  by 17 .",
    "when placed on - axis at the focal plane of the grazing - incidence x - ray mirrors , the imaging resolution is determined primarily by the pixel size of the ccds , 0492 .",
    "the ccds also measure the energies of incident photons within a calibrated energy band of 0.58  kev , with a resolution of 50300 ev ( depending on photon energy and distance from the read - out node ) .",
    "the ccd frames are read out every 3.2  s , which provides the nominal time resolution of the data .",
    "the methods we used to create a combined image of the field , to identify point sources , and to compute the photometry for each source are described in @xcite and @xcite . in brief , for each observation we corrected the pulse heights of the events for position - dependent charge - transfer inefficiency @xcite , excluded events that did not pass the standard asca grade filters and _ chandra _  x - ray center ( cxc ) good - time filters , and removed intervals during which the background rate flares to @xmath9 above the mean level .",
    "the final total live time was 626 ks . in order to produce a single composite image",
    ", we then applied a correction to the absolute astrometry of each pointing using three tycho sources detected strongly in each _ chandra _  observation ( compare * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and re - projected the sky coordinates of each event to the tangent plane at the radio position of . the image ( excluding the first half of obsid 1561 , during which the @xmath10  erg @xmath11 s@xmath1  transient  was observed ;",
    "see muno et al .",
    "2003c ) was searched for point sources using @xcite in three energy bands : 0.58  kev , 0.51.5  kev , and 48  kev .",
    "we used a significance threshold of @xmath12 , which corresponds to the chance probability of detecting a spurious source within a beam defined by the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we detected a total of 2357 x - ray point sources .",
    "of these , 281 were detected in the soft band ( 124 exclusively in the soft band ) , and so are located in the foreground of the galactic center .",
    "the remaining sources , of which 1792 were detected in the full band , and 1832 in the hard band ( 441 exclusively in the hard band ) are most likely located near or beyond the galactic center .",
    "we computed photometry for each source in the 0.58.0  kev band using the routine from the tools for x - ray analysis ( tara ) .",
    "we extracted event lists for each source for each observation , using a polygonal region generally chosen to match the contour of 90% encircled energy from the psf , although smaller regions were used if two sources were nearby in the field .",
    "we used a region defined by the psf for 1.5  kev photons for foreground sources , and a larger extraction area corresponding to the psf for 4.5 kev photons for galactic center sources .",
    "a background event list was extracted for each source from a circular region centered on the point source , excluding from the event list ( _ i _ ) counts in circles circumscribing the 95% contour of the psf around any point sources and ( _ ii _ ) the bright , filamentary structures noted by @xcite .",
    "the background region was unique for each observation .",
    "it was chosen to include a fraction of @xmath13 total counts , where the number of counts from each observation was scaled to the fraction of the total exposure time .",
    "the photometry for the complete sample of sources is listed in the electronic version of table  3 from @xcite .",
    "we then extracted spectra and background estimates for each of the sources from the same regions from which we computed the photometry .",
    "we summed the source and background spectra from all 12 observations .",
    "then , we grouped the source spectra between 0.58.0  kev so that each spectral bin contained at least 20 total counts .",
    "next , we computed the effective area function at the position of each source for each observation .",
    "this was corrected to account for the fraction of the psf enclosed by the extraction region and for the time - varying hydrocarbon build - up on the detectors .",
    "we estimated the detector response for each source in each observation using position - dependent response files that accounted for the corrections we made to undo partially the charge - transfer inefficiency @xcite . finally , to create composite functions    for the full data set , we averaged both the response and effective area functions , weighted by the number of counts detected from each source in each observation .",
    "four example spectra are displayed in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "we have confirmed that the spectra of the point sources were not contaminated by the diffuse x - ray emission in the field by repeating the analysis above for a subset of sources using an extraction region that enclosed only 50% of the psf at 4.5  kev .",
    "the spectra were indistinguishable for the larger and smaller extraction regions , which confirms that we have successfully removed the background emission from the point - source spectra .",
    "we modeled the x - ray spectra of those sources with at least 80 net counts , which provided four or more independent spectral bins . to provide a rough characterization of the spectrum ,",
    "we used either a power - law or thermal plasma continuum absorbed at low energies by gas and dust . to model the thermal plasma , we used in @xcite .",
    "we assumed that the elemental abundances were 0.5 solar , which is consistent with the values derived from the average spectra of the point sources ( see section  [ sec : av : vapec ] ) , as well as the fe abundances often observed from cvs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we accounted for gas absorption using the model phabs , and the dust scattering using a modified version of the model dust    in which we removed the assumption that the dust was optically thin .",
    "the column depth of dust was set to @xmath14 , and the halo size to 100 times the psf size @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : indiv ] we list the parameters of the best - fit spectral models : the column densities @xmath15 , either the power - law slope @xmath16 or the temperature @xmath17 , the observed and de - absorbed 28  kev fluxes , and the reduced @xmath18 . the uncertainties are 90% confidence intervals ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we also indicate sources from which the spectra should be viewed with caution , of which there are three categories : confused sources for which the radii of their psf overlap those of a nearby source by more than 25% , sources that were near chip edges , and sources with variability ( section  [ sec : var ] ) . about 25% of the sources",
    "are flagged in this manner .",
    "we consider a spectrum to be adequately reproduced by a model if the chance probability of obtaining the derived value of @xmath18 is greater than 5% . of the 566 sources that we modeled in this manner",
    ", the spectra of 470 could be modeled with an absorbed power law , and 469 could be modeled with an absorbed , collisionally - ionized plasma .",
    "both spectral models were consistent with the data for 440 sources , because of limited statistics and the small bandpass over which photons are detected ( for most sources , galactic absorption prevents photons @xmath20  kev from reaching the detector , while the effective area of the acis - i is small above 8  kev ) .",
    "only 30 sources could be modeled with a power law but not a thermal plasma , while 29 sources could be modeled by a thermal plasma but not a power law .",
    "finally , 67 spectra deviated from both continuum models at the 95% level .",
    "about 25 of these resemble statistical fluctuations , 30 are bright sources that appear to require multiple continuum components , and 12 exhibited strong iron emission between 6 and 7 kev .    for individual sources ,",
    "the uncertainties on the spectral parameters are rather large .",
    "however , it is possible to draw some general conclusions about the population of x - ray sources from table  [ tab : indiv ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : dist ] , we plot the distributions of the best - fit absorption columns and photon indices or temperatures for all of those sources that    were adequately fit with the simple absorbed continuum model . as was mentioned in @xcite , 265 out of 470 of the point sources have power - law spectra with @xmath21 , even after accounting for the absorption column .",
    "however , only 77 sources have 90% confidence limits for which @xmath21 , and some of the apparent hardness of their spectra is due to line emission from fe between 67 kev ( see section  [ sec : fe ] ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the hard sources also have high best - fit temperatures under the thermal plasma model .",
    "however , because of the poor statistics and small bandpass , the temperatures are unconstrained in one - third of the sources , and there are only 21 sources with 90% lower limits on the temperatures that are @xmath22  kev .",
    "the slopes of the spectra are not correlated with the intensities of the sources ( figure  [ fig : gvf ] ) .",
    "the median absorption column toward the the sources is @xmath23  @xmath11 for a power - law continuum , and @xmath24  @xmath11 for a thermal plasma continuum .",
    "the median value for the power - law continuum is identical to the column that is inferred from the @xmath25-band extinction toward  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a summary ) , while that for a thermal plasma continuum is twice as high .",
    "the difference between the median values results from the facts that ( 1 ) for a faint , hard source the values of @xmath15 and the spectral slope can not be determined independently , and ( 2 ) the thermal plasma continuum , can appear no harder than a @xmath26 power law .",
    "therefore , the thermal plasma models produce a higher median value of @xmath15 . under either model , 30% of the sources",
    "are inferred to have a absorption column of @xmath27  @xmath11 .",
    "the one source that appears to be absorbed by more than @xmath28  @xmath11 , cxogc j174539.3290027 , is relatively faint , and the spectrum is poorly constrained .",
    "finally , we note that these spectra have been modeled assuming that all of the x - rays from a given source are absorbed by a single column of material .",
    "if we assume instead that a fraction of the x - ray emitting region is absorbed by a higher column ( so - called `` partial covering '' models ) an acceptable fit can be obtained for an arbitrary range of continuum shapes , because the bandpass over which we measure the spectrum is limited .",
    "visual inspection of the 67 sources for which the simple continuum failed to reproduce their spectra indicates that @xmath29% exhibit residuals between 67  kev that may represent line emission from fe .",
    "therefore , we have performed a uniform search for fe line emission from the brightest sources with hard spectra .",
    "we selected only those sources with more than 160 net counts , because we found that fainter sources were unlikely to provide more than one spectral bin between 67 kev .",
    "likewise , we selected only those sources that were best - fit by absorbed power laws with @xmath30 , because sources with steeper spectra were typically background - dominated above 6  kev .",
    "there were 183 sources that met both of these criteria .",
    "we modeled each source with an absorbed power law plus a gaussian line that was fixed at either 6.4 kev to search for low - ionization ( `` neutral '' ) fe emission , or at 6.7 kev to search for he - like fe .",
    "the widths of the lines were fixed at 100 ev , to account for the fact that both the low - ionization and he - like lines are actually a blend of multiple transitions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    to evaluate the significance of the added line , we computed a statistic @xmath31 from the reduction in @xmath18 provided by the more complex model : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the values with and without the line , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the numbers of degrees of freedom for the fits ( @xmath37 , here ) . unfortunately , because the null result of our more complex model , a line of zero flux , lies on a boundary of the parameter space we are considering ( i.e. , an emission line with negative flux is not physical , so the hard lower limit to the line flux is 0 ) , @xmath31 is not distributed according to the @xmath38distribution @xcite . therefore , we have simulated the expected distribution of @xmath31 for each of our sources using the markov - chain monte carlo technique described in @xcite .",
    "this technique allows us to evaluate the chance probability of observing a value of @xmath31 given ( 1 ) the statistical distributions of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and    the normalization from the fit , ( 2 ) the method used to group the spectral bins , and ( 3 ) the spectrum assumed for the background subtraction . between 1001000 simulations values from the simulations",
    "exceeded the observed @xmath31 value more than once , indicating the significance of the line was @xmath39% .",
    "for the rest , we ran 1000 simulations , to establish whether the line was at least 99% significant ( i.e. , @xmath40 @xmath31 values exceeding the observed one ) . ]",
    "were computed for each source .",
    "we present in figure  [ fig : mcmc ] a comparison of the chance probabilities derived from the theoretical @xmath41-distribution and from the monte carlo simulations . in general , the theoretical @xmath41-distribution significantly under - estimates the significance of a line ( the chance probability is deemed to be too large ) , although in 10% of the cases",
    "the theoretical distribution over - estimates the significance .",
    "this demonstrates the necessity of performing simulations in order to estimate the significance of an added line feature .",
    "we have listed those sources with significant line emission in table  [ tab : iron ] .",
    "we consider a line to be detected if it has less than a 1% chance probability of arising from random variations in the continuum , and if the fit produced @xmath42 . in total , 35% ( 64 out of 181 ) of the sources that we examined have significant fe line emission .",
    "we find that 25% of sources exhibit a significant line near 6.7  kev , while 16% of sources exhibit emission at 6.4  kev .",
    "there are 15 sources with significant lines at both 6.4 and 6.7  kev , but these tend to be faint sources in which it is not possible to constrain the line energy .",
    "we plot histograms of the equivalent widths and the equivalent widths as a function of the flux in figure  [ fig : iron ] . for both species , the equivalent widths range from 200 ev to 5 kev .",
    "the median equivalent widths were 370 ev for the 6.4 kev fe line , and 530 ev for the 6.7 kev fe line .",
    "six sources have lines with equivalent widths greater than 1  kev that appear upon visual inspection to be real .",
    "there are two systems with apparent equivalent widths @xmath43 kev , but these have steep continuum spectra with @xmath44 , and the excess emission between 67 kev represents either a hard continuum component or poor background subtraction .",
    "when line emission is not detected , the median 1-@xmath45 upper limits to the line equivalent widths are 220  ev for he - like fe , and 240  ev for low - ionization fe .      in order to understand the average spectra of the galactic center point sources",
    ", we summed the spectra of sub - groups of the individual point sources .",
    "we selected only those sources that were not detected below 1.5  kev with , as these are most likely to lie near the galactic center .",
    "we also excluded sources brighter than 500 net counts , because these sources provided individual spectra of good quality .",
    "we computed average effective area and response functions by averaging those from the individual sources , weighted by the number of counts from each source .",
    "we estimated the average background by extracting a spectrum from the rectangular region that traced the orientation of the acis - i detector during the 500  ks series of observations from 2002 may to june .",
    "we excluded from the background spectrum events that fell within circles circumscribing the 95% contour of the psf around any point sources .    in figure",
    "[ fig : psraw ] , we display the summed spectra of the galactic center point sources with fewer than 500 net counts .",
    "the spectrum below 2  kev is dominated by the diffuse emission from the galactic center . in figure",
    "[ fig : psmod ] we display the background - subtracted spectrum .",
    "the instrumental ni line at 7.5  kev is absent from the spectrum , which indicates that the background subtraction was successful .",
    "lines of si , s , and ar are also weak or absent in the spectrum of the point sources , in contrast to that of the diffuse emission ( dashed line in figure  [ fig : psraw ] ) .",
    "prominent lines from he - like and h - line fe are evident at 6.7 and 6.9  kev , while weak , fluorescent k-@xmath46 emission from low - ionization fe is evident at 6.4 kev .",
    "we modeled this spectrum using two approaches .",
    "first , we modeled the emission phenomenologically , using a power - law continuum and gaussian line emission from si ,    s , ar , ca , and fe .",
    "the lines we included were chosen by examining whether lines from the strongest transitions from table  1 in mewe , gronenschild , & van den oord ( 1985 ) significantly improved the residuals when comparing the model to the data .",
    "for the final model , we placed lines at the energies expected for the he - like @xmath47 transitions of si , s , ar , ca , and fe ; the he - like @xmath48 transitions of si and s ; the h - like @xmath47 transitions of si , s , ar , and fe ; and low - ionization fe k-@xmath46 at 6.4  kev .",
    "this model allowed us to measure and compare the equivalent widths of the lines .",
    "we also used a model consisting of two thermal plasma components , each of which was absorbed by a separate column of gas .",
    "this model is identical to the model used for the diffuse emission by @xcite .",
    "we also note that this model is qualitatively similar to the multi - temperature , multi - absorber models typically used to model the accretion shocks in magnetized cvs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "several assumptions were required for the models to reproduce the data .",
    "first , we only applied the model between @xmath49  kev .",
    "below this energy range the photon counts are dominated by foreground diffuse emission , while above this range the acis - i has a small effective area .",
    "second , when modeling individual lines with gaussians , the widths of the lines from he - like si , s , and fe and low - ionization fe were allowed to be as large as @xmath50  ev to account for the fact that the lines are blends of several transitions that can not be resolved with acis .",
    "third , we allowed for a @xmath51% shift in the energy scale in each spectrum because of uncertainties in gain calibration of our cti - corrected data . when fitting gaussians to the he - like transitions and the 6.4  kev line of fe , the line centroids were varied one - by - one until they achieved best - fit values , and then frozen . when using plasma models , the red - shift parameter was used to change the energy scale in a similar manner .",
    "finally , a 3% systematic uncertainty was added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty in order to account for uncertainties in the acis effective area .    to account for absorption in each model we assumed ( 1 )    that the entire region was affected by one column of material that represents the average galactic absorption ( modeled with in ) and ( 2 ) that a fraction of each region was affected by a second column that represents absorbing material that only partially - covers the x - ray emitting region ( modeled with ) .",
    "this partial - covering absorption model produces a low - energy cut - off that is less steep than that which would be produced by a single absorber .",
    "the model can roughly account for the fact that both the point sources and absorbing material are distributed along the line of sight .",
    "the mathematical form of the model was @xmath52 + f_{\\rm pc}e^{-\\sigma(e)n_{\\rm pc , h } } ) , \\label{eq : abs}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the energy - dependent absorption cross - section , @xmath15 is the absorption column , @xmath54 is the partial - covering column , and @xmath55 is the partial - covering fraction .",
    "dust scattering was not included , because when modeling the spectrum its optical depth was degenerate with the partial - covering fraction @xmath55 .",
    "since the natures of these point sources are uncertain , the most straightforward way of modeling their spectrum is with an absorbed power - law continuum and gaussian line emission .",
    "the average spectrum of sources with fewer than 500 net counts is displayed along with the model spectrum in figure  [ fig : psmod ] .",
    "the model parameters are listed in the first column of table  [ tab : psint ] .",
    "after some initial tests , we found that @xmath55 was poorly constrained , but the best - fit values were near 0.95 .",
    "we therefore fixed @xmath55 to this value .",
    "the remaining parameters were allowed to vary . the total absorption column , @xmath56  @xmath11 ,",
    "is slightly higher than the expected galactic value .",
    "simulations in indicate that this is probably because we did not include dust scattering , which produces about 30% of the total absorption .",
    "the inferred continuum is flat , with photon index @xmath4 , which is similar to the median value from the individual sources , @xmath2 .",
    "finally , the equivalent width of the he - like fe line is 400  ev , which is similar to that observed from individual bright sources .",
    "the strength of the neutral fe line is considerably lower than those detected from the individual sources , although this is not surprising since fewer of the individual sources exhibit 6.4  kev lines than do 6.7  kev lines ( see section  [ sec : fe ] ) .",
    "we then examined how the average spectra of the point sources varied with flux .",
    "we compared the summed spectra of sources with fewer than 80 net counts to those with 80500 net counts , because these two groups of sources produce nearly the same numbers of net counts ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters of our phenomenological model of these spectra are listed in the second two columns of table  [ tab : psint ] .",
    "both the absorption column and photon index were slightly larger in the bright sources .",
    "however , the continuum shape looks very similar by eye . to highlight this , in figure  [ fig : rat ] we plot the ratio of the averaged spectra of sources with 80500 net counts to that of sources with @xmath58 net counts .",
    "the only differences in the continuum spectra are above 7  kev , which may indicate that the faint sources produce slightly more high - energy flux .",
    "differences in the equivalent widths of the line emission are also evident in figure  [ fig : rat ] .",
    "the equivalent width of the fe xxv he-@xmath46 emission was 30% higher in the fainter sources ( 3.7@xmath45 ) , and the equivalent width of neutral fe k-@xmath46 was a factor of 2 lower in the faint sources ( 4.9@xmath45 ) .",
    "there is also a factor of 3 less s he-@xmath46 emission in the faint sources ( 4.3@xmath45 ) .",
    "we also split the data into smaller flux intervals , and found similar results .",
    "thus , the continuum spectra of the point sources change very little with intensity , but the s and fe lines range over a factor of @xmath59 in equivalent width .",
    "we also examined the combined spectra as a function of the hard color , which provides a measure of the steepness of the spectrum .",
    "the hard color is defined as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the number of counts in a hard band from 4.78.0  kev , and @xmath62 is the number of counts in a softer band from 3.34.7  kev .",
    "we divided the data using three ranges in hard color , guided by the expected power - law index from simulations with @xcite : @xmath63 for sources with @xmath64 spectra , @xmath65 for sources with @xmath26 spectra , and @xmath66 for sources with @xmath67 spectra .",
    "the spectra are plotted in figure  [ fig : spechr ] , and the best - fit parameters for the phenomenological model are listed in the last three columns of table  [ tab : psint ] .",
    "we find that the sources with larger @xmath68 have continuum spectra that are intrinsically flatter , at least given our model for the interstellar and intrinsic absorption .",
    "we also find significant changes in the line strengths , although there is no monotonic trend with @xmath68 .",
    "we next modeled the spectra of the point sources as originating from two thermal plasmas , each of which was absorbed by a separate component as parameterized in equation  [ eq : abs ] , as well as emission from low - ionization fe at 6.4  kev .",
    "the parameters of the best fit models to the average spectra for the groups of sources used in the previous section are all listed in table  [ tab : twokt ] .",
    "the values of @xmath69 are generally larger under the plasma models than under the phenomenological models , because the plasma models predict too little flux above 7  kev .",
    "however , the plasma models do provide a good qualitative description of the data .",
    "the weak lines from si , s , and ar require cool plasmas with @xmath70  kev ; this component appears to be visible only in sources with @xmath66 .",
    "the abundances of si and s appear to be significantly below solar values in the soft sources , where the lines are most clearly detected .",
    "the he - like and h - like fe lines require hotter plasmas with @xmath71  kev .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "long - term variations are more common and are often caused either by changes in the density of the wind at the location of compact objects that have eccentric orbits around the donor star , or by instabilities in the excretion disks around the be stars that are the mass donors in half of the known hmxbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the above considerations suggest that faint , neutron star hmxbs can account for some fraction of the hard galactic center point sources .",
    "the main problem with this hypothesis is that few hmxbs have been observed at @xmath151  erg s@xmath1 , and the ones that have can be described with much softer @xmath171 spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , the physics of x - ray production at low accretion rates is uncertain , so we can not be certain of what x - ray properties to expect from faint hmxbs .",
    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are the most numerous accretion - powered x - ray sources .",
    "their local space density is @xmath172 pc@xmath104 @xcite , so that if we scale their number to the stellar density at the galactic center , within 20 pc of  we would expect @xmath173 cvs , and within a cylinder centered on the galactic center that is 20 pc in radius and 440 pc deep we would expect @xmath174 .",
    "about 50% of cvs are luminous enough to be observed from the galactic center @xcite , so they could account for the majority of the x - ray sources detected there .",
    "systems with non - magnetized white dwarfs , which comprise 80% of cvs , have luminosities between @xmath175  erg s@xmath1 , and spectra that can be described with @xmath176  kev plasma from an accretion shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , these systems should have hard colors @xmath122 in figure  [ fig : indiv ] , and would be located in a similar portion of the color - intensity diagram as rs cvns and ysos .    cvs containing magnetized white dwarfs , which are referred to as polars and intermediate polars depending on whether or not the rotational period of the white dwarf",
    "is synchronized to its orbital period , comprise about 20% of all cvs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see also the cvcat database ) .",
    "polars have similar spectra and luminosities as un - magnetized cvs , with the addition of a @xmath177  ev `` soft excess '' that is attributed to `` blobs '' of accreted material that penetrate deeply into the photosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the soft component would be unobservable above 2  kev , so polars should also have @xmath178 in figure  [ fig : indiv ] .",
    "polars also commonly exhibit variations in their average luminosity on time scales of years : @xmath179% of the polars surveyed by @xcite changed in intensity by factors of @xmath180 between observations taken with _ rosat _  ( 19901999 ) and _ xmm - newton _  ( 2000present ) .",
    "such variations would be detectable from most of the galactic center sources ( figure  [ fig : shortterm ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the two years spanned by the _ chandra _  observations of the galactic center , we would expect @xmath181 of the polars to exhibit long - term variations . since only 2% of the sources located at or beyond the galactic center",
    "are variable , at most 20% could be polars .",
    "the intermediate polars are typically more luminous than other cvs , with @xmath182  erg s@xmath1 , and represent about 5% of the total population ( see cvcat ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is thought to be related to the fact that they tend to have longer orbital periods ( @xmath183 h ) , which could result in a higher mass transfer rate ; however , the high @xmath184 could also be a selection effect , because if a cv is bright , it is easier to detect modulations in the x - ray and optical emission at the rotational and orbital periods @xcite .",
    "intermediate polars also typically have much harder spectra than other cvs : when approximated as a power law , the optically thin thermal plasma usually seen from cvs should have @xmath26 , whereas the spectra of intermediate polars usually have @xmath64 .",
    "this is probably a result of the geometry of the accretion flow , because , as in other cvs , prominent line emission from he - like and h - like fe indicates that the x - rays are produced either by plasma with @xmath111  kev or by a plasma photo - ionized by continuum x - rays that are not observed directly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in either case",
    ", the x - ray emitting regions would have to be partially absorbed by material in the accretion flows , which removes low - energy photons from the spectra , thus making them flatter .",
    "intermediate polars should have @xmath168 in figure  [ fig : indiv ] , which makes them the best candidates among cvs for the hard galactic center sources .",
    "the detailed spectral properties of intermediate polars are broadly consistent with the average spectra of the point sources in figure  [ fig : psmod ] .",
    "weak emission at 6.4  kev is observed from these systems , and is attributed to x - rays that reflect off of the white dwarf s surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , when the spectra of intermediate polars are modeled as emission from thermal plasma , the derived fe abundances are often near or below the solar values ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is similar to what we infer for the point sources in table  [ tab : twokt ] .",
    "finally , the general lack of variability in the x - ray emission from the galactic center sources ( aside from periodic modulations ) is also consistent with the stable emission usually seen from intermediate polars . on long time scales ,",
    "the optical luminosity of intermediate polars usually remains constant for many decades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; because the optical and x - ray flux are correlated in polars , we would expect the x - ray emission from intermediate polars also remains constant . flares lasting several hours , presumably from accretion events , are sometimes observed from magnetic cvs , but appear to be rare and most prominent in the soft x - ray band ( @xmath20  kev ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the predominant short time scale variability in intermediate polars is due to modulations of the emitting regions as the white dwarfs rotate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have detected periodic modulations from seven of the brightest 285 galactic center sources @xcite . since we were only sensitive to high - amplitude modulations , it is likely that many sources with low - amplitude modulations went undetected .",
    "therefore , although the faintness of the galactic center x - ray sources is probably the main cause of the lack of observed short - term variability , it is also plausible that the sources are intrinsically steady x - ray emitters like intermediate polars .",
    "since the properties of the galactic center sources change little as a function of their luminosity between @xmath5 and @xmath6  erg s@xmath1(figures  [ fig : rat ] and [ fig : indiv ] ) , we believe that the majority of the galactic center sources are intermediate polars .",
    "intermediate polars comprise 5% of all known cvs @xcite , so given that there could be @xmath185 cvs within a pencil - beam centered on the galactic center that is 20 pc in radius and 440 pc deep , they could reasonably account for the 1000 x - ray sources with @xmath186 .",
    "bykov ( 2002 , 2003 ) has suggested that the point sources in the galactic center may not be stellar , but could be iron - rich fragments of supernova explosions that are interacting with molecular clouds . on order @xmath187 x - ray emitting knots",
    "could plausibly be produced by just 3 supernova occurring within the last 1000 y within 20  pc of the galactic center ; already , sgr a east @xcite and the radio wisp e @xcite are thought to be remnants of recent supernova .",
    "the observational properties of the point sources can be reproduced by choosing several parameters in the ejecta model @xcite : the slope @xmath188 distribution of the knots ( @xmath189 ) is determined by their sizes and velocities , the slopes of their continuum x - ray emission ( @xmath190 ) is set by the amplitudes of magneto - hydrodynamic turbulence in the shocks they produce , and the equivalent widths of the fe emission ( up to 1  kev ) by their iron abundances .",
    "future observations of known supernova remnants will better constrain the properties of the x - ray emitting knots , which in turn could make it possible to distinguish such knots from the stellar sources in the field .",
    "a handful of the galactic center sources resemble unusual objects that have been found through shallower _ asca _ , _ bepposax _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ integral _  surveys of the galactic plane .",
    "these sources are important , because they could represent stellar remnants that are in short - lived states of accretion .",
    "we list the properties of 14 unusual sources from other surveys in table  [ tab : odd ] .",
    "the first three are polars that were identified with _ asca _  as having unusually strong emission lines from he - like fe ( equivalent widths @xmath191 kev ) ; the fourth _ xmm - newton _  source has similarly strong fe emission at 6.7 kev , but its nature is uncertain .",
    "we find that 6 out of 183 galactic center sources searched for fe emission have 6.7 kev lines with equivalent widths greater than 1 kev , which is similar to the fraction of such sources identified in the _ asca _  galactic plane survey .",
    "the next four are highly - absorbed ( @xmath192  @xmath11 ) sources identified with _ integral _  and _ xmm - newton _ , one of which has strong low - ionization fe emission with an equivalent width @xmath191  kev .",
    "we find that 30% of the galactic center sources have similarly high absorption , and two systems exhibit 6.4  kev fe lines with equivalent widths @xmath191 kev ( cxogc j174613.7290662 and gxocg j174617.2285449 in table  [ tab : iron ] ) .",
    "the final five are hard x - ray sources with slow ( @xmath193  s ) , high - amplitude periodic modulations in their x - ray emission .",
    "we find seven hard sources near the galactic center ( and one foreground source ) with similar periodic x - ray modulations @xcite .",
    "these sources would have been difficult to identify with the soft x - ray detectors on _ rosat _  ( 0.12.4 kev ) , which was the last observatory that systematically surveyed the sky for faint x - ray sources .",
    "our study of the galactic center suggests that they account for a few percent of all faint x - ray sources .",
    "we have established that , on average , the x - ray sources detected in 626  ks of _ chandra _  acis - i observations of the field around  have hard , @xmath21 spectra with prominent emission from he - like fe at 6.7  kev ( figure  [ fig : psmod ] and table  [ tab : psint ] ) .",
    "they also generally do not vary by more than factors of a few on time scales of hours or months .",
    "the best candidates for these hard x - ray sources are intermediate polars , which represent the most luminous and spectrally hardest 5% of all cvs .",
    "therefore , the galactic center x - ray sources are likely to be only a sub - sample of a population of @xmath165 cvs located near the galactic center .",
    "although a single population of sources may dominate the image , there are certainly many classes of objects present in smaller numbers in the field . determining the numbers of rare objects is particularly important .",
    "for instance , the numbers of massive wolf - rayet and o stars and faint neutron star high - mass x - ray binaries can constrain the recent rate of massive star formation near the galactic center , while the numbers of lmxbs provide direct tests of the validity of unusual pathways for binary stellar evolution . for this reason",
    ", we are carrying out deep infrared observations of the galactic center to identify counterparts to the x - ray sources .",
    "these observations will be useful for distinguishing cvs from , for example , hmxbs and wr / o stars . at at a distance of 8  kpc and with an extinction of @xmath194 @xcite , cvs should have @xmath25 magnitudes of 2225 , and therefore would be among the faintest detectable sources at the galactic center @xcite .",
    "in contrast , hmxbs and wr / o stars should have @xmath25 magnitudes brighter than 15 @xcite and will be very easy to detect .",
    "therefore , the prospects for identifying the natures of the galactic center x - ray sources are promising .",
