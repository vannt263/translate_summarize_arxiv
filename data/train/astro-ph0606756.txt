    "while studies in visible light , particularly spectroscopy , have been key to our understanding the nature and evolution of stars during most of their life cycles , the early and late stages of stellar evolution are best studied in the infrared .",
    "this is because , during these stages , the stars are embedded in regions of dust and gas .",
    "the late stages of stars of intermediate initial mass ( 1  8  ) are characterized by very high luminosities and obscuration by dusty , expanding circumstellar envelopes ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "circumstellar dust envelopes absorb photospheric optical and ultraviolet emission and re - radiate it in the mid- to far - infrared ( mfir ) .",
    "thus evolved intermediate - mass stars are luminous in the infrared ( ir ) but may be highly obscured at optical wavelengths .",
    "current theories of the later stages of the evolution of mass - losing stars therefore have been informed by _ iras _ , _ iso _ , and _",
    "2mass _  studies of intermediate - mass evolved stars in the milky way galaxy and magellanic clouds .",
    "understanding the envelope chemistry of optically - obscured post - main sequence ( ms ) stars through ir studies is important for our overall view of galaxy evolution , since these stars dominate the rate of return of stellar processed material to the ism @xcite . optical surveys",
    "( e.g. , @xcite and refs .  therein )",
    "can miss these objects because they are too faint to be detected .",
    "dusty circumstellar shells in evolved stars are produced as the star loses mass via a combination of pulsations and radiation pressure on dust grains newly formed via the pulsation process .",
    "once accelerated , these grains strip the ( predominantly molecular ) gas away from the stellar envelope . while on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , intermediate mass stars undergo dredge - up and surface enrichment in products of nucleosynthesis .",
    "the enriched material is thus returned to the ism via the molecule - rich circumstellar dust shell .",
    "more massive ( @xmath28  ) stars in the red supergiant ( rsg ) stage may resemble high mass - loss rate agb stars , in that they are also surrounded by optically - thick circumstellar dust shells , though such high mass - loss rate rsgs are rare .",
    "highly - obscured , evolved intermediate - mass ( agb ) stars with large mass - loss rates likely dominate the rate of return of nuclear processed material to the interstellar medium .",
    "however , in our own galaxy , it can be difficult to distinguish between high mass - loss agb and rsg stars , due to their highly uncertain distances .",
    "ir spectroscopy is particularly useful in determining the properties of circumstellar dust .",
    "the emission and absorption properties of different dust grains have been studied in the laboratory and modeled ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ir - bright stars in the galaxy have been observed with the _ iras _",
    "lrs and , subsequently , with the spectrometers aboard _ iso _",
    "( see reviews by @xcite and references therein ) and classified using the dust features revealed in these spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the sensitivity of the _ spitzer _  infrared spectrograph ( _ irs _ , @xcite ) on the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope @xcite now makes it possible to study the ir spectra of ir - luminous , evolved stars in nearby galaxies .    in the absence of spectroscopy ,",
    "photometric tools such as color - color diagrams can be used to identify and classify evolved stars .",
    "new studies of stellar populations in the galaxy as well as in nearby external galaxies will rely in particular on photometry obtained with the _ spitzer _  infrared array camera ( _ irac _ , @xcite ) and multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer_(_mips _ , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the point sources detected in _",
    "irac _  and _ mips _",
    "imaging of nearby galaxies likely will be dominated by dust - enshrouded post - ms stars . as strong silicate and carbonaceous",
    "dust features at @xmath310  distinguish c - rich and o - rich envelope chemistries , respectively , the use of _ irac _  and _ mips _",
    "colors can , in principal , avoid the ambiguity in assigning stellar classes based on near - infrared ( nir ) colors ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter ) .",
    "however , such photometric diagnostics must first be reliably associated with ir spectral properties , which are best determined from _ irs _  spectroscopy .",
    "as previous infrared surveys have demonstrated ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is an ideal nearby galaxy to study the evolution of mass - losing post - ms stars .",
    "firstly , it contains a large population of ir - luminous , mass - losing objects found at essentially the same distance , thereby alleviating the distance ambiguities that haunt _ iras _  and _ iso _  samples of mass - losing stars in the galaxy .",
    "this allows the spectral properties of the lmc evolved star population to be directly related to their luminosities , providing important constraints on stellar models .",
    "indeed , the luminosity distribution of carbon stars in the lmc has long been a key test of models of the late stages of stellar evolution in low metallicity environments ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , the low metallicities and high star formation rates of the lmc mimic those of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "in addition , spectra of lmc objects can be used to establish `` ground truth '' for ir photometric diagnostics .    due to the proximity of the lmc ,",
    "individual objects have been detected by previous ir satellites : _ iras _  and _ msx _",
    "each detected @xmath31800 ir sources in or towards the lmc ( @xcite ; ) .",
    "the most sensitive band on _ msx _ , a band ( @xmath4 = 8.3  ) , was approximately four times more sensitive than the _ iras _  12  band , and permitted the detection of evolved stars with less extreme ir luminosities than those detected by _ iras_.  combined the _ msx _  a band flux ( in magnitudes ) with near - ir ( jhk ) measurements from the _ 2mass _  survey to form various diagnostic color - color and color - magnitude diagrams for the lmc objects . to classify their nature based upon these ir fluxes , they compared these color - color and color - magnitude diagrams to analogous diagrams constructed for various classes of stars based upon the @xcite `` sky '' model of the galaxy . on this basis , they characterized the stars in specific categories , including red supergiants , early ( low mass loss ) o - rich and c - rich agb stars ( category 5 ) , late ( high mass loss ) o - rich and c - rich agb stars ( category 6 ) , and pns and h  ii regions ( category 7 ) . within these categories ,",
    "the different types of objects were distinguished somewhat on the basis of colors , although only for the late c - rich and o - rich agb stars were the objects well distinguished within a category .",
    "note that  classified @xmath3500 of the @xmath31800 objects in their study as foreground galactic objects . to check the accuracy of this classification scheme for the lmc objects , investigated the spectral types of the lmc objects using data in simbad .",
    "however , for the bona fide lmc objects , only a small percentage had classifications ; these were especially uncommon for categories 6 and 7 .",
    "although the limited data do not contradict their classifications , these classifications suffer from limited spectroscopic support .",
    "this is not surprising , as the ir - luminous objects detected by _ msx _",
    "do not commend themselves to visible spectroscopy , and the requisite mid - ir spectroscopy has been impractical until only recently . to date ,",
    "the study by  stands as the most comprehensive classification of luminous 8  sources in the lmc .",
    "therefore it is important to verify and/or correct the  color classifications .",
    "we have conducted a spectroscopic study with _ spitzer _  _ irs _  ( pi : j. kastner ; pid : 3426 ) of a representative sample of objects selected on the basis of their ir colors and magnitudes to be the most ir - luminous post - ms stars in the lmc . here",
    "we present the atlas of spectra .",
    "we then use these spectra as the basis both for understanding the high - luminosity end of the lmc evolved star population and for establishing photometric diagnostics for classifying ir stars . in  [ sec : obs ] we describe the sample selection , observations , and data reduction . in  [ sec : res ] we present the spectra and classify them according to continuum and spectral features and bolometric luminosities . in ",
    "[ sec : dis ] we describe the classes of objects identified and compare the classifications with the types assigned by .",
    "we then use our library of _ irs _  spectra to show how _ spitzer_/_2mass _",
    "colors can be used to classify ir - luminous sources in external galaxies reliably and unambiguously .",
    "on the basis of our new classifications , we discuss the implications for the late stages of stellar evolution .",
    "detailed analysis of individual spectra and of the spectral classes established in this study will be presented in future papers .",
    "the complete sample observed by _ irs",
    "_  comprises 62 ir sources , selected on the basis of large 8.3  fluxes from the comprehensive catalog of _ 2mass_/_msx _",
    "sources compiled by .",
    "the  sources were classified based on ir colors .",
    "these sources have coordinates accurate to @xmath5 .",
    "we selected those _ msx _  8.3  ( a - band ) sources with @xmath6  mjy ( a@xmath7 ) that were classified by , on the basis of",
    "_ 2mass_/_msx _  ir colors , as `` late '' ( i.e. very red ) o - rich agb (  oor ` oh / ir ' ) , `` late '' c - rich agb ( ` c ir ' ) , red supergiants ( ` rsg ' ) , or planetary nebulae ( ` pn ' ) .",
    "this resulted in a preliminary sample of @xmath8 sources .",
    "of these , @xmath9% were classified as oh / ir , @xmath10% as pn , @xmath11% as rsg , @xmath11% as o agb , and @xmath12% as c ir .",
    "we then randomly deselected sources so as to `` thin '' this preliminary list to 59 targets , distributed so as to include 10  15 sources from each of these five evolved star spectral classes defined in the  _ 2mass_/_msx _  study . to ensure representation in the sample of the most rapidly mass - losing , and",
    "hence highly obscured , objects  which may have not been detected by _",
    "2mass _  and therefore may have been excluded from the  sample  we include seven additional _ iras_sources . these were sources selected from known or candidate evolved stars @xcite , that satisfied our 8  flux criterion , for which _ 2mass_positions were made available subsequent to publication of the  msx lmc catalog , and which were not listed on the _ spitzer _  reserved observations catalog .",
    "of this final sample of 66 sources , four targets ( 1  source and 3 _ iras _",
    "sources ) were not observed , due to conflicts with other _ spitzer_programs .",
    "the 62 observed sample objects are listed in table [ tab : sample ] , where we list _",
    "2mass _  ( j , h , and k ) and _ msx _  ( a ) magnitudes , ir types determined from the ir colors by , and object types and other star names we obtained from simbad .",
    "the targets were observed by _ spitzer _  using the _ irs _  in staring mode .",
    "the short - low ( sl ) and long - low ( ll ) modules were used ; these modules cover the wavelength ranges 5.2  14  and 14  38  , respectively , with resolving powers of 64  128 .",
    "two nod positions along the slit were observed to facilitate rejection of artifacts in the data .",
    "for most objects , four exposures of 30 and 14 seconds for the sl and ll modules , respectively , were obtained at each nod position .",
    "a few unusually bright objects were observed with shorter exposure times to avoid saturating the detector . to accurately position each object in the slit ,",
    "a peak - up procedure was used ( _ irs _  or pcrs ) . two observations ( msx  lmc  769 and 773 ) were unsuccessful due to peak - up failure ; the fields were crowded and the peak - up centered on the wrong object .",
    "thus , this atlas presents spectra of 60 objects .",
    "the raw data were processed through the _ spitzer _  pipeline version s11.0 . after pipeline processing , the basic calibrated data ( bcds ) were processed using the smart software @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional spectral images ( bcds ) of the multiple exposures were median - combined and , in most cases , the off - source images were subtracted to remove the sky background . in the case of four objects ,",
    "the off order was contaminated and could not be used for sky subtraction . in these cases ,",
    "the sky was estimated locally , on either side of the extracted aperture .",
    "spectra were extracted and the fluxes were calibrated using the default point source extraction apertures in smart . the modules at each nod position were merged and the edges and overlapping regions of the modules were trimmed .",
    "the spectra from the two nod positions were then averaged to produce the final spectrum .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "pipeline produces uncertainty images ; however the uncertainty images produced by the s11 pipeline are unreliable .",
    "therefore , we estimated the flux uncertainty in each spectrum based upon the differences between the two nod position spectra at each wavelength .",
    "the final uncertainty for each spectrum was assumed to be the median value of the uncertainties at all wavelengths ; these generally ranged from 2  20  mjy , though 4 objects had median uncertainties @xmath230  mjy .",
    "we found that the relative uncertainties ( the median value of the uncertainty at each wavelength divided by the flux at that wavelength ) were typically @xmath32% , with a maximum of 5% .",
    "we note that the wavelength calibration in the s11 pipeline is incorrect ( too red ) by 0.04  for the sl module and also uncertain ( by @xmath130.14  ) for the ll module .",
    "these wavelength inaccuracies are not expected to have any effect on the analysis or conclusions of this paper .",
    "mass - losing evolved stars are expected to show distinctive ir features , depending on the chemistry of the circumstellar dust ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "oxygen - rich dust shows silicate features at 9.7 and 18  which appear in emission at low optical depths and absorption at high optical depths ( i.e. high mass - loss rates ) .",
    "carbon - rich stars show a broad sic dust emission feature at 11.5  and a narrow absorption feature at 13.7  , due to  gas in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "the irs spectra are presented in figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the spectra are grouped according to the dominant spectral features : features indicative of a predominance of silicate dust ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec]_a _ ) ; features indicative of a predominance of carbonaceous dust and/or molecules ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec]_b _ ) ; or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features and narrow emission lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec]_c _ ) .",
    "the o - rich objects are further divided into subgroups ( see  [ subsec : res_clas ] ) . within each group , the objects",
    "are then placed in order of increasing luminosity , which we have calculated ( see  [ subsec : res_lum ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : spec ] also shows the infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the sample objects , including the _ irs _  spectra , _ msx _  8.3  fluxes , and _",
    "2mass _  and _ iras _  fluxes ( obtained from simbad ) where available . two objects ( msx  lmc  1072 and 1524 )",
    "were observed using only the ll modules , as data were already being obtained for _ spitzer _  project pid:1094 . a third object ( msx  lmc  1280 )",
    "was observed using only the sl modules , as data were being obtained for program pid:3505 .",
    "the largest of the three groups of spectra is that of the oxygen - rich objects .",
    "these mostly show the expected strong silicate emission features and have continua that are dominated by photospheric emission at short wavelengths and dust emission at longer wavelengths .",
    "the silicate features are generally quite smooth , indicating an amorphous composition for the silicate dust ( msx  lmc  1326 is a notable exception , showing peaks indicative of crystalline silicate dust ; @xcite ) .",
    "many of the spectra of the evolved o - rich objects ( most of which are rsgs ; see  [ subsec : dis_class_o ] ) also show a narrow 6.2  emission feature .",
    "this is unexpected , since this feature is generally attributed to pahs , carbon - based molecules which are not expected to be found in the circumstellar environment of an o - rich evolved star .",
    "the 2-dimensional spectra show that this feature is commonly seen in emission in the sky ( i.e. , in the lmc ) in the vicinity of these o - rich objects , and that there is some spectral contamination that is not completely canceled out in the sky subtraction process . however , this sky emission is at very low flux density levels , not enough to explain the bright features observed .",
    "extraction of off - source spectra indicates that the 6.2  feature can is only detectable on the source , and is not apparent in off - source spectra , with or without sky subtraction .",
    "the presence of this 6.2  carbon feature , and the suggestion of the 11.3  pah feature , in the spectra of some o - rich objects is a puzzle .",
    "the second group of objects , the c - rich sources , show the expected sic emission and  absorption features and have continua dominated by dust emission .",
    "the broad `` 30 micron '' feature seen in c - rich evolved sources and attributed to mgs is also present in most .",
    "there are also a significant number of very red objects that show forbidden emission lines and strong features attributed to pahs ; these make up the third group of sources in our sample . in figure",
    "[ fig : egspec ] we present a typical spectrum from each of the three groups , with the primary spectral features indicated .",
    "spurious features appear in several of the spectra , at wavelengths 15.6 , 18.7 , 33.5 , 34.8 , and 36.0  .",
    "examination of the 2-dimensional spectral images shows that these are due to background `` sky '' emission lines originating in diffuse gas in the lmc ; the lines appear in off - source as well as on - source spectral images and are unrelated to the program sources .",
    "the wavelengths correspond to known [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] emission lines .",
    "these spurious features appear in our spectra of c - rich and o - rich sources in emission or absorption ; because this diffuse emission is not uniform across the region covered by the spectrograph slit , it is not always removed properly by our sky subtraction .",
    "these features are seen at much stronger levels in emission in the very red emission - line objects , and in these cases they clearly arise from the sources themselves .",
    "infrared luminosities were calculated by integrating the flux over the wavelength range 1  100  .",
    "the _ irs _",
    "spectra were used to determine the flux densities over the wavelength range 5.0  36.0  .",
    "the integrated fluxes over the range 1  5  were determined using a blackbody scaled to match the _ 2mass _  flux densities , and the flux densities from 36  100  were estimated using a blackbody weighted by @xmath14 ( to approximate optically - thin emission ) and scaled to match the _ irs _  spectrum and available _ iras _  data .",
    "an example of this procedure for each of the three groups is shown in figure [ fig : lumcalc ] . a distance to the lmc of 50.1  kpc ( distance modulus 18.50  mag ; @xcite ) was assumed .",
    "the uncertainties in the luminosities are dominated by the uncertainty in the shapes of the spectral energy distribution in the wavelength ranges outside the irs spectrum .",
    "the temperatures of the blackbodies were varied to estimate the uncertainties in the measurement of the luminosities , which were found to be 5 ",
    "10% for the o - rich and c - rich evolved stars .",
    "the assumption that the shape of the sed between 2 and 5  can be approximated by a blackbody curve was investigated using iso spectra of galactic objects and might contribute an additional uncertainty to the luminosities of up to a further 19% ( typically 4% ) . in calculating the luminosities of the mass - losing stars ,",
    "we note that we have neglected the effects of variability .",
    "long period variables may vary by up to 1 magnitude in the nir , which results in up to a factor 2.5 uncertainty in the derived luminosities of these objects , assuming that the shape of the 1  100  sed remains the same as the flux varies .",
    "although not affected by variability , the uncertainties in the measurement of the luminosities of the red emission - line objects are large because most of the emission is from wavelengths longer than the irs spectral range , where the shape of the spectral energy distribution is poorly constrained .",
    "the uncertainties in the luminosities of these sources may be up to a factor of a few .",
    "the bolometric luminosity will be dominated by the ir luminosity for most sources .",
    "the rsgs are the only stars in the sample for which optical emission might be expected to contribute significantly to the sed ; however , we find that the derived bolometric correction for the rsgs has very little dispersion between objects (  [ subsec : dis_cols ] ) , so there can be little contribution shortward of jhk .",
    "luminosities are listed in table [ tab : data ] .",
    "histograms of the luminosities of the stars in each group are shown in figure [ fig : lumhist ] .",
    "several ir spectral classification schemes have been established since the advent of satellite mid - ir spectroscopy . _",
    "iras _  had a low - resolution spectrometer ( lrs ) that obtained spectra in the range 8@xmath1523 with a resolution that varied from @xmath340 at the short end to @xmath320 at the long end .",
    "the original _ iras _",
    "lrs atlas contained spectra of 5425 sources @xcite .",
    "these were classified based upon the continuum shape ( blue or red ) and the presence or absence of certain dominant spectral features ( i.e. , silicate emission or absorption or c - rich features ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite extracted spectra of additional objects from the _ iras _  database to arrive at a total of 11,224 sources .",
    "these were classified into nine groups , with a one - letter designation based on the dominant spectral feature(s ) and/or the shape of the continuum .",
    "@xcite developed a new classification system ( hereafter the kspw system ) that they applied to the over 900 objects for which complete spectra were obtained by _",
    "iso _  with the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) .",
    "the sws had a wavelength range of 2.4@xmath1545 @xmath16 m with a resolution of 1000  2000 .",
    "since our irs spectra extend to 38  and have a resolution of 64  120 , they are better matched to the _ iso _  spectra , and we will consequently classify our spectra according to the kspw system .    we compared our _ irs _  spectra to typical _ iso _  spectra in the kspw spectral classes . in the kspw system , stars are classified according to their continua , with subclasses assigned according to the appearance of specific spectral features .",
    "the continuum is characterized by the temperature of the dominant emitter , in particular whether it is photospheric or dust emission .",
    "spectral features include broad features associated with silicate or carbon rich dust emission , complex features thought to be due to pah emission , and narrow atomic and molecular features .",
    "we classified each of our sample objects according to the kspw system .",
    "we also assigned an `` _ irs _  type '' to each star in our sample based on the observed spectral features and luminosities ( as well as optical information for the two peculiar objects ) .",
    "the various classifications of the sample objects so derived from the _ irs _  spectra are listed in table [ tab : data ] , along with the original  type .",
    "the new classifications are discussed in the next section .",
    "o - rich objects represent the largest group in the sample , with 33/60 objects ( 55% ) having ir features indicative of o - rich dust .",
    "the majority of these o - rich spectra ( 25/33 ) are dominated by photospheric emission at shorter wavelengths and by dust emission at longer wavelengths ( group 2 in the kspw system ) .",
    "most of these ( 22 objects ) have strong silicate dust emission features , and hence we classify these objects as belonging to kspw subgroup 2sec , while the remaining three are best classified as 2sea .",
    "these 3 objects show weaker , broader 10  emission and weaker , more sharply peaked 18 - 20  emission than the 2sec stars , as well as a 13  feature in emission , possibly due to aluminum - rich silicate grains @xcite .",
    "all except one ( msx  lmc  1677 , discussed below ) of the 22 o - rich objects with strong dust features and significant photospheric emission have ir luminosities @xmath17  , and so we identify them as rsgs .",
    "the previous classifications of these objects  were either o - rich agb stars or rsgs ( see table [ tab : data ] ) .",
    "examination of the luminosities of the three o - rich stars in subgroup 2sea and msx  lmc  1677 ( subgroup 2sec ) reveals that , if these stars were at the distance of the lmc , they would have luminosities @xmath185.8@xmath19  .",
    "these luminosities would place them significantly above the distribution of luminosities for the rsgs ( figure [ fig : lumhist ] ; these four objects are not included in the histogram ) .",
    "we conclude that these four stars are in fact in the halo of the milky way galaxy .",
    "one of the stars , msx  lmc  412 ( rs men ) , is a known galactic cap mira variable with a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath2140  and period of 304 days @xcite .",
    "these authors derive a distance to this star of 4.75  kpc using the period - luminosity relation to determine the luminosity and inferring the distance from the measured flux .",
    "we estimate luminosities for the other three galactic stars using their k magnitudes and color - period - luminosity relationships determined by @xcite .",
    "distances of 4.2 , 3.3 , and 5.1  kpc , for msx  lmc  1150 , 1686 , and 1677 , respectively , were inferred for the three sources using luminosities so derived .",
    "three of the stars are identified by as o  agb stars from their blue nir colors , while one star , msx  lmc  1686 , had been misidentified as a c agb star .",
    "the nir colors of msx  lmc  1686 are consistent with the categories of both o agb and c agb  and   note that there is some confusion and overlap between these categories .",
    "these galactic cap stars will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "three , possibly four , of the o - rich stars , msx  lmc  642 , 1072 , 1524 , and 1280 , have spectra dominated by warm dust ( group 3 ) .",
    "we classify these as kspw subgroup 3se , i.e. , similar to the majority of the o - rich stars ( subgroup 2sec ) with strong silicate emission at 10 and 18  from optically thin dust emission , but with thermal continuum from an optically thick dust shell .",
    "the sed , @xmath20 , peaks around 10  15  , indicating a strong warm dust contribution , although @xmath21 peaks closer to 2  , due to the contribution from the reddened stellar photosphere .",
    "the silicate emission features are stronger than the galactic o - rich agb stars discussed above .",
    "the combined sl+ll spectra of msx  lmc  1072 and 1524 , kindly provided by marckwick - kemper , confirm the classifications we made based on our ll spectra .",
    "the classification of msx  lmc  1280 is based on our sl spectrum , which covers only the 5  14  wavelength range , and is therefore somewhat tentative .",
    "the luminosity of this source was derived by assuming the same spectral shape as msx  lmc  1189 , and is highly uncertain . these four o - rich stars with dust - dominated spectra have ir luminosities of @xmath32  7 @xmath22  , placing them very high on the agb , so we tentatively identify these as luminous o - rich agb stars . although the theoretical limit for the luminosity of agb stars is @xmath23  , luminosities slightly higher than this may be possible from higher mass ( @xmath310  ) progenitors at low metallicity ( i.e. , super - agb stars @xcite ) .",
    "our classifications of these objects based upon the mid - ir spectra differ significantly from those of : one of the 3se stars ( msx  lmc  1072 ) has  type pn , but its _ irs _  spectrum clearly lacks the red continuum .",
    "it is likely to be a o agb star , as it only narrowly falls outside of the criteria for identifying o agb stars in : h - k = 0.76 , 0.01 magnitudes too red .",
    "the other stars classified as 3se have  type c ir .",
    "msx  lmc  1280 , 1524 , and 642 have _ 2mass_/_msx _",
    "colors inconsistent with the  criteria for o agb , oh / ir stars and rsgs but their _ irs _  spectra clearly indicate o - rich envelopes .",
    "we find no population of less luminous o - rich agb stars in the sample .",
    "it is possible lower luminosity o - rich objects were excluded from the sample due to our a - band selection criterion ( @xmath6  mjy ;  [ sec : obs ] ) . unlike the c - rich agb stars , the 8  flux is a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity for the o - rich agb stars , therefore lower luminosity o - rich agb stars are relatively fainter at 8  .",
    "the 4 galactic o - rich agb stars in our sample , for example , would have @xmath24  mjy if they were at the distance of the lmc , and so would have been excluded from our sample .",
    "identifications of o - rich agb stars fainter than those studied in this work are necessary to confirm the possibility that the lack of lower luminosity o - rich agb stars in our sample is a selection effect .",

    "most of these are too luminous to be the immediate descendents of evolved , intermediate - mass stars ( figure [ fig : lumhist ] ) , but rather they agree with the luminosities of  regions powered by massive young o stars .",

    "the similarity of the continuum shapes of the pn and  region in figure [ fig : pncomp ] suggests that these types of objects will have similar mid - ir ( 5  35  ) colors and so will be difficult to distinguish photometrically in this wavelength range .",
    "the _ irs _  spectra provide further evidence that the pah - dominated sources are extended  regions and not pne .",
    "the discontinuity seen at @xmath314  between the spectra formed by the short and long wavelength modules ( see fig . [",
    "fig : egspec]_c _ ) is attributed to the extended nature of these sources ( a similar phenomenon also affects certain _ iso_spectra of extended sources ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this `` jump '' indicates that the spatial extents of the pah - dominated sources are greater than the width of the sl slit ( 3.6 ) , which is smaller than the ll slit ( 10.5 ) .",
    "a spatial extent of 5  at 50.1  kpc corresponds to a physical size of 25000  au ( 1.2  pc ) , confirming that these sources are unlikely to be pne .",
    "the red , emission - line sources also appear extended in 2-d spectral images and this is confirmed by fitting gaussian functions along the spectrum of each source and comparing the fwhm to a similar fit to one of the o - rich point sources ( msx  lmc  1150 ) .    in summary",
    ", we find that all of the program objects selected as pne based on their nir/_msx _  colors are , in fact , dusty  regions associated with luminous young o / b stars . thus the color distinction between these two groups made by",
    "is not supported .",
    "this in fact confirms their caveat that many of their objects classified as pn may be  regions with enhanced reddening .",
    "revised criteria will need to be developed to distinguish pn from  regions photometrically , and these will probably need to rely upon wavelengths other than just the near- and mid - ir .",
    "figure [ fig : nircols ] shows ir color - color diagrams for the stars in this study , based upon the _",
    "2mass _  and _ msx _  photometry .",
    "the stars of most of the various irs spectral types separate quite cleanly into different regions of this diagram , confirming that ir color criteria can be used to classify the spectral types , although this may not be the case for distinguishing pne and  regions , and pne may occupy the region between the agb stars and the  regions and make the separation less clean .",
    "as previously noted , however , our irs spectral classifications frequently differ from the original  classes assigned to these objects .  indeed mention that the o - rich and c - rich agb star classifications are rather uncertain due to the similar regions in color space that these objects occupy .",
    "other authors have also shown , both observationally @xcite and theoretically @xcite , the difficulty of distinguishing o - rich and c - rich evolved stars based on their ir colors .",
    "we nevertheless propose modified ir color criteria , based on the locations of objects in figure [ fig : nircols ] , subject to the uncertainty due to our sample incompleteness .",
    "the isolated locations of the two oh / ir stars in our sample in the color - color diagrams suggests that other  objects with _",

    "further observations are required to probe the borderline regions where classifications overlap or are uncertain and to identify where pne in the lmc lie on these diagrams .",
    "color - magnitude diagrams are also extremely useful in discriminating between spectral types of stars ( figure [ fig : colmag ] ) .",
    "the galactic and lmc objects separate clearly , with galactic objects having brighter apparent magnitudes due to their relatively modest distances .",
    "the agb star luminosity sequence is also evident , with the c - rich objects in the majority and the most ir - luminous agb stars being o - rich .",
    "the most ir - luminous lmc objects in our sample are the rsgs and the lone oh / ir supergiant ( msx  lmc  1182 ) , the latter of which is redder due to the thick dust shell presumably surrounding this source .",
    "the lone oh / ir agb star ( msx  lmc  807 ) has a lower ir luminosity , comparable to the c - rich agb stars .",
    "the  regions , which have j - band magnitudes similar to , but k magnitudes fainter than , the c - rich agb stars ( due to their bluer j - k colors ; fig .",

    "one of the primary goals of this program was to determine reliable relations between _ spitzer _  _ irac _  and _ mips _",

    "therefore , we also derived _ irac _  and _ mips _  flux densities for the objects using the _ irs _  spectra and the spectral response functions of the _ irac _  5.8 and 8.0  bands and the _ mips _  24  band .",

    "the three galactic pne plotted overlap with the  regions and appear to fill the gap between the evolved stars and regions .",
    "clearly , observations of lmc pne are required to determine whether the proposed photometric classifications of evolved stars and  regions are `` contaminated '' by pne .",
    "the comparison objects were selected at random from the database of @xcite  subject to the constraint that the _ iso _  spectrum had reasonable signal - to - noise ratio  and the synthetic _ irac _  and _ mips _",
    "colors were derived from the _ iso _  spectra .",
    "the galactic objects fall in the same regions of the diagram as the lmc stars , indicating that the _ irac_/_mips _  color - color diagrams are not very sensitive to metallicity . therefore these diagnostics can be applied to external galaxies without being adversely affected by metallicity differences , at least in the range @xmath30.5  1  .",

    "color - magnitude diagrams represent an effective means to distinguish between evolved stars and  regions in external galaxies , and should easily identify the most luminous , rapidly mass - losing stars ( i.e. , oh / ir supergiants ) in such galaxies .",
    "ir colors may also be useful to infer the luminosity of evolved stars . using the measured luminosities of the c - rich agb stars and the rsgs , for which we have a sufficiently large number of objects , we investigated the relation between the luminosity and the nir ( k - band ) magnitude .",
    "we defined a quasi-``bolometric correction '' to be the ratio of the bolometric luminosity to the k - band flux density .",
    "for the c - rich agb stars , this ratio shows a clear trend with the k - a color ( figure [ fig : cbolcor ] ) .",

    "predicted in this way is less than a factor of 2 , with most of predicted luminosities within 20% of the measured luminosity .    for the rsgs ,",
    "there is a unique value of the `` bolometric correction '' for all k magnitudes ( figure [ fig : rsgbolcor ] ) .",
    "the mean value for all sources is @xmath39  /jy .",
    "thus the luminosities of rsgs can be predicted from their k magnitudes with an uncertainty of less than 15% .",
    "these results are potentially very useful in the study of galactic carbon stars and rsgs , assuming that metallicity does not affect the bolometric correction .",
    "the bolometric corrections derived here will enable estimates of luminosities , and hence distances , of stars to be made simply from their ir colors and fluxes .      the predominance of c - rich stellar envelopes among the lower - luminosity members of our sample , and a relatively sharp dividing line between c - rich and o - rich infrared - luminous , evolved stars , is apparent in table [ tab : data ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : lumhist ] .",
    "these results suggest constraints on models of the processes of nuclear burning and dredge - up in intermediate- to high - mass stars and , at the same time , may indicate the importance of the metallicity of the star - forming environment on the ultimate evolutionary endpoints of such stars .",
    "we caution that our ir - luminous lmc sample was selected based on a classification scheme that has proven somewhat unreliable , especially with regard to the distinctions between o - rich and c - rich agb stars and between pne and  regions .",
    "this sample therefore may not well represent the ir - luminous , evolved stellar population of the lmc . the flux limit imposed",
    "may also have biased the sample against o - rich agb stars .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that we find @xmath40% of the agb stars in our sample are c - rich argues that the low metallicity of the lmc serves to facilitiate carbon star formation , due to the relative ease of inverting the c / o ratio at the stellar surface . at the same time , the apparent upper cutoff in the luminosity of ir - luminous carbon stars in the lmc , @xmath41  ( table [ tab : data ] ) , implies an upper limit of @xmath33.7  for the initial mass of carbon star progenitors in the lmc @xcite , though we note that this depends on assumptions about the mass loss , dredge - up efficiency and envelope burning .",
    "the apparent presence of such a carbon star luminosity cutoff , and the fact that the only three agb stars brighter than this are o - rich , suggests that `` hot bottom burning '' ( see @xcite and references therein ) inhibits carbon star formation in the lmc for initial masses larger than @xmath33.7  .",
    "furthermore , the fact that all rsgs in the sample are o - rich suggests that the he - burning phase for such massive ( @xmath42  ) stars is short , that the onset of c burning in such stars is rapid , and/or that the envelopes of such stars are sufficiently massive that it is difficult to invert the c / o ratio even given low initial metallicity .",
    "we also note that , for the o - rich evolved stars , all except one ( msx  lmc  1072 ) with @xmath43  have spectral shape 2sec , while all except one ( msx  lmc  815 ) with @xmath44  have spectral class 3se .",
    "this transition coincides with the theoretical upper limit on agb luminosity @xcite , although luminous o - rich stars in a hot bottom burning phase may fall above the classical agb limit ( e.g. , @xcite ) so the luminosity separation of agb stars and rsgs is uncertain .",
    "the two exceptions are the ones closest to this dividing luminosity and it may be that variability is playing a role in confusing the classification of the two objects .",
    "thus is it possible that the _ irs _  spectral shape may provide clues to an object s luminosity and progenitor mass , which would be particularly useful in cases where the luminosity is otherwise ambiguous .",
    "we caution , however , that the present lmc _",
    "irs _  sample was selected to represent the types of object in the lmc but not their relative numbers , and so is not proportionally representative of the luminous mid - ir population of the lmc . for example , the most luminous sources listed in  are dominated by objects classified as `` oh / ir stars ''  which , our irs survey demonstrates , are predominantly or perhaps exclusively c - rich agb stars  whereas such objects constituted only @xmath10% of the sample we have surveyed thus far with irs .",

    "the oh / ir supergiant msc  lmc  1182 , along with the two luminous c - rich agb stars that are also _ iras _  sources ( msx  lmc  1592 and 1652 ) , offer indications of the types of sources we might expect to find among this group .",
    "we have obtained _ spitzer _  low - resolution spectra for a representative sample of 60 luminous 8  sources in the lmc .",

    "the _ irs _  spectra covered the wavelength range 5  35  , allowing determination of the envelope chemistry from detailed spectral features , particularly silicate emission features at 10 and 18  in o - rich objects and the sic emission feature at 11  and  absorption feature at 13.7  in c - rich objects .",
    "we derived ir luminosities from the combined _",
    "2mass _  and _ irs_spectral energy distributions of the objects and used these , along with the spectra , to classify the object types .",
    "we identify 16 c - rich agb stars , 4 o - rich agb stars , 21 rsgs , 11  regions , and 2 oh / ir stars ( one supergiant and one agb star ) .",
    "we also find 2 b supergiants that have peculiar ir spectra and 4 o - rich agb stars that are in fact foreground galactic mira variables .",
    "we find the vast majority of the agb stars , with ir luminosities @xmath0  , have c - rich envelopes , while the o - rich objects are almost all luminous rsgs with @xmath45 .",
    "the predominance of c - rich stars along the agb in the lmc is consistent with the hypothesis that c - rich stars form more easily than o - rich stars in lower metallicity environments .",

    "the fact that all of the supergiant stars are o - rich , in turn , may indicate that massive supergiants do not have sufficiently long he - burning lifetimes to produce c - rich surfaces , and hence c - rich ejecta , despite the low metallicity of the lmc .",

    "<S> we present an atlas of _ spitzer _  space telescope infrared spectrograph ( _ irs _ ) spectra of highly luminous , compact mid - infrared sources in the large magellanic cloud . </S>",
    "<S> sources were selected on the basis of infrared colors and 8  ( _ msx _ ) fluxes indicative of highly evolved , intermediate- to high - mass stars with current or recent mass loss at large rates . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the chemistry of the circumstellar envelope from the mid - ir continuum and spectral features and classify the spectral types of the stars . in the sample of 60 sources , we find 21 red supergiants ( rsgs ) , 16 c - rich asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , 11  regions , 4 likely o - rich agb stars , 4 galactic o - rich agb stars , 2 oh / ir stars , and 2 b[e ] supergiants with peculiar ir spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the overwhelming majority of the sample agb stars ( with typical ir luminosities @xmath0  ) have c - rich envelopes , while the o - rich objects are predominantly luminous rsgs with @xmath1  . </S>",
    "<S> for both classes of evolved star ( c - rich agb stars and rsgs ) , we use the near- to mid - infrared spectral energy distributions to determine mean bolometric corrections to the stellar k - band flux densities . for carbon stars , </S>",
    "<S> the bolometric corrections depend on the infrared color , whereas for rsgs , the bolometric correction is independent of ir color . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal that objects previously classified as pne on the basis of ir colors are in fact compact  regions with very red _ irs _  spectra that include strong atomic recombination lines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the _ irs _  spectral classes in our sample separate clearly in infrared color - color diagrams that use combinations of _ 2mass _  data and synthetic _ irac_/_mips _  fluxes derived from the _ irs_spectra . on this basis </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest diagnostics to identify and classify , with high confidence levels , ir - luminous evolved stars and compact regions in nearby galaxies using _ spitzer _  and near - infrared photometry . </S>"
