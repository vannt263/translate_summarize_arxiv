    "recently the concepts and methods of statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics are applied to investigate social , economic and psychological phenomena @xcite . among the interesting subjects that have attracted",
    "physicists are the opinion dynamics @xcite including voting process @xcite and social impact theory @xcite .",
    "social impact theory stemmed from the bystander effect that was first demonstrated in the laboratory by psychologists who studied the effect of social interaction among bystanders @xcite .",
    "this effect is a marvel phenomenon where people are less likely to intervene in emergencies when others are present than when they are alone .",
    "a well known example is kitty genovese case @xcite .",
    "she was stabbed to death at one night in 1964 by a mentally ill murderer for about 30 minutes while at least 38 witnesses were believed to have failed to help the victim . on the other hand",
    "the refutation that the popular account of the murder is mostly wrong was suggested on the website @xcite .",
    "regardless to this controversy @xcite many experimental results in the laboratory and from field studies show the bystander effect obviously @xcite .",
    "although the social impact theory originated from the bystander effect and related models have been developed , there does not exist any model describing quantitatively the bystander effect itself . to construct the model mentioned above we abstract a few important factors from the existing literatures @xcite .",
    "the main dependent variables are the rates of reporting the smoke in the test room , helping endangered victims and so on .",
    "when tested alone , subjects behaved reasonably and the response rate was high .",
    "however the rate was significantly depressed when they were with other subjects .",
    "subjects with others were unsure of what had happened or thought other people would or could do something . in another experiment subjects who were friends responded faster than those who were strangers . the subjects who had met the victim were significantly faster to report victim s distress than other subjects . and",
    "the degree of arousal that bystanders perceive is a monotonic positive function of the perceived severity and clarity of the emergency , and bystander s emotional involvement with the victim , which will be also considered by our rescue model in an abstract way .",
    "a simple rescue model is introduced for investigating the statistical feature of the effects of the victim s acquaintance with bystanders and those among bystanders in emergency situations .",
    "we focus on the relations between agents rather than agents themselves , so define a relation spin between two agents as @xmath1 which is @xmath2 if agents @xmath3 and @xmath4 have been successful in the intervention and @xmath5 otherwise .",
    "@xmath1 can be interpreted as an element of adjacency matrix of helping network .",
    "each agent @xmath3 has its intervention threshold @xmath6 over which that agent can try to intervene in an emergency situation .    at each time",
    "step an accident happens which consists of the degree of accident represented as a random number @xmath7 uniformly drawn from @xmath8 $ ] , a randomly selected victim @xmath9 , the number of bystanders @xmath0 confined to @xmath10 $ ] , and a set of randomly selected @xmath0 bystanders @xmath11 from a population .",
    "then the update rule is as following : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a heaviside step function .",
    "only one bystander @xmath14 with the largest value @xmath15 can intervene per accident .",
    "if we assume that the response speed of bystander @xmath3 is exponential in @xmath15 , the selection of the bystander with the largest @xmath15 is justified .",
    "additionally , once one bystander intervenes , the pressures on the others will disappear . if @xmath16 , the rescue succeeds and then the victim @xmath9 and that bystander @xmath3 gain acquaintances if they have not been related to each other . in case of @xmath17 the rescue fails and then their acquaintance is cut if existed .",
    "@xmath18 represents the degree of victim s acquaintance with bystander , so can be called an acquaintance strength .",
    "the third term of @xmath19 function is related to the acquaintances among bystanders , for each relation @xmath20 gives @xmath2 if two bystanders know each other or @xmath21 otherwise .",
    "there does not exist any neutral relation here .",
    "@xmath22 is used to tune the strength of coupling so can be called a coupling strength . as an order parameter we adopt the average helping rate : @xmath23 which can be also interpreted as a social temperature or an average linkage of the helping network .",
    "we fix @xmath24 for all @xmath3 according to the experimental result @xcite that @xmath25 of alone subjects intervened and @xmath26 does not change through this paper , which means we consider a population composed of homogeneous and non - adaptive agents . and for the most cases @xmath18 is also fixed as @xmath27 .",
    "the main control parameter is the number of bystanders @xmath0 .",
    "finally , the initial conditions are @xmath28 for all pairs .",
    "at first let us consider only the effect of victim s acquaintance with bystanders and ignore those among bystanders .",
    "generally an equation for the average helping rate can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 denote @xmath32 for a fixed @xmath0 .",
    "given the values of parameters as above , when @xmath33 , the rescue fails independent of @xmath34 so one of acquaintances , if exists , should be cut .",
    "when @xmath35 , @xmath36 so this interval of @xmath7 does not contribute to the equation .",
    "when @xmath37 the rescue succeeds independent of @xmath34 so a new acquaintance is formed only if there is no acquaintance between them . @xmath38",
    "the stationary solution is obtained easily . @xmath39",
    "the solution means that although the coupling strength is not considered ( @xmath29 ) , the helping rate depends on the number of bystanders @xmath0 . as increasing @xmath0 the probability that the victim does not know any bystanders ( contributes to @xmath40 ) decreases rapidly and the complementary probability ( contributes to @xmath41 ) increases",
    "this is why the helping rate decays . in this case",
    "@xmath18 affects not the decaying behavior but the decaying speed only when @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath18 becomes larger than @xmath26 , @xmath43 so @xmath44 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and reproduce the experimental results that people who live in larger cities are less likely to help the strangers @xcite .",
    "compared to ref .",

    "here @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . ]",
    "if the coupling among bystanders is taken into account and @xmath49 , the interval @xmath8 $ ] of @xmath7 is divided into five subintervals by four points @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "whether @xmath51 is smaller or larger than @xmath52 does not affect the result .",
    "for each subinterval the transition rate is calculated .",
    "@xmath54 the second term in r.h.s . of @xmath55 vanishes when @xmath56 , so we get the solutions for both cases . @xmath57    the numerical simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] support the analytic solution .",
    "one can find a maximum value of @xmath58 when @xmath59 , which means that there exists an optimal coupling strength @xmath60 to maximize the helping rate when given @xmath26 and @xmath18 .     and",
    "@xmath58 has a maximum value when @xmath59 .",
    "the other parameter values are the same as fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . ]      for a general @xmath0 , the interval @xmath8 $ ] of @xmath7 is divided by the following points : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath62 , @xmath65 . for each subinterval",
    "the transition rate can be calculated .",
    "@xmath66 where @xmath67 consequently to get a stationary solution we must solve the following equation .",
    "@xmath68 since @xmath69 is the @xmath70th order polynomial , the order of above equation is @xmath71 and difficult to solve exactly for all @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , as an approximation we consider only the most left , the second and the most right subintervals . @xmath72",
    "the approximate stationary solution is @xmath73    .",
    "circles represent the numerical results and solid line and dotted line do the approximate solution for @xmath74 and for @xmath29 for comparison respectively .",
    "inset graph shows the exponentially decaying behavior of the same data . ]",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the numerical simulations supporting the approximation except for @xmath75 .",
    "the helping rate undergoes a trough for @xmath0 less than @xmath76 , which is also partly observed in the experiment results @xcite , and then decreases monotonically as for the case without a coupling effect ( @xmath29 ) . for @xmath77",
    "the helping rate shows a sudden drop to @xmath5 . to understand this behavior",
    "intuitively two factors should be considered . on the one hand as for the case without a coupling effect , the increasing number of bystanders increases the probability of cutting acquaintance too . on the other hand the most left subinterval @xmath78 , which most contributes to @xmath41 , decreases as increasing @xmath0 . in this paper @xmath26",
    "is fixed as a rather small value so that a change of the most right subinterval rarely affects @xmath40 . in conclusion ,",
    "when @xmath79 the former factor dominates the latter so that the helping rate decreases .",
    "when @xmath80 the increasing @xmath0 minimizes the inhibiting effect by other bystanders to make the helping rate increase .",
    "once @xmath0 passes @xmath76 , the decreasing subinterval vanishes and only the former factor works .     as a function of @xmath22",

    "coupling effect among bystanders plays both positive and negative roles in emergencies .",

    "especially when @xmath82 , @xmath83 decays exponentially with slope of @xmath84 in the semi - log plot .",
    "once @xmath0 passes @xmath85 , @xmath83 turns to @xmath5 because of too many other inhibiting bystanders .",
