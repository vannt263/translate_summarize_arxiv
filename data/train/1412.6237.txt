    "an edge coloring of a graph @xmath0 is called an _ acyclic edge coloring _ if it is proper ( i.e. , adjacent edges receive different colors ) and every cycle in @xmath0 contains edges of at least three different colors ( there are no _ bichromatic cycles _ in @xmath0 ) .",
    "the least number of colors needed for an acyclic edge coloring of @xmath0 is called the _ acyclic chromatic index _ of @xmath0 and is denoted by @xmath1 . the notion of acyclic ( vertex )",
    "coloring was first introduced by grnbaum @xcite .",
    "the edge version was first considered by fiamik @xcite , and independently by alon , mcdiarmid , and reed @xcite .    as for many other graph parameters ,",
    "it is quite natural to ask for an upper bound on the acyclic chromatic index of a graph @xmath0 in terms of its maximum degree @xmath3 . since @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the ordinary chromatic index of @xmath0",
    ", this bound must be at least linear in @xmath3 .",
    "the first linear bound was given by alon et al .",
    "@xcite , who showed that @xmath14 .",
    "although it resolved the problem of determining the order of growth of @xmath1 in terms of @xmath3 , it was conjectured that the sharp bound should be lower .",
    "[ conj : aecc ] for every graph @xmath0 , @xmath2 .",
    "note that the bound in conjecture [ conj : aecc ] is only one more than vizing s bound on the chromatic index of @xmath0 .",
    "however , this elegant conjecture is still far from being proven .",
    "the first major improvement to the bound @xmath14 was made by molloy and reed @xcite , who proved that @xmath15 .",
    "this bound remained the best for a while , until ndreca , procacci , and scoppola @xcite managed to improve it to @xmath16 .",
    "this estimate was recently lowered further to @xmath4 by esperet and parreau @xcite .",
    "all the bounds mentioned above were derived using probabilistic arguments , and recent progress was stimulated by discovering more sophisticated and powerful analogues of the lovsz local lemma , namely the stronger version of the lll due to bissacot , fernndez , procacci , and scoppola @xcite and the entropy compression method of moser and tardos @xcite .",
    "the probability that a cycle would become bichromatic in a random coloring is less if the cycle is longer .",
    "thus , it should be easier to establish better bounds on the acyclic chromatic index for graphs with high enough girth .",
    "indeed , alon et al .",
    "@xcite showed that if @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is some universal constant , then @xmath2 .",
    "they also proved that if @xmath19 , then @xmath20 .",

    "we are now turning to the case when @xmath11 is bounded below by some constant independent of @xmath3 , which will be the main topic of this paper .",

    "consists in further improvement of the latter bounds .",
    "namely , we establish the following .",

    "that almost the same proof in fact works for any bipartite @xmath5 was observed by esperet and de verclos .",
