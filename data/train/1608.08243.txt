    "the interest in quantum key distribution ( qkd ) schemes  @xcite through free - space channels is caused by the intriguing practical perspectives : communication between mobile participants , link through hardly accessible regions , global quantum communications via satellites  @xcite , etc .",
    "the entanglement- and nonlocality - based qkd protocols usually assume sharing entangled field modes between remote participants . in this context",
    "the ekert protocol ( e91 ) @xcite is based on checking violations of bell inequalities , cf .",
    ", e.g. , ref .  @xcite .",
    "for example , in experiments performed on the canary islands , nonlocality has been checked for photons transfered through a @xmath0 atmospheric channel @xcite .",
    "a consistent theoretical analysis of bell - inequality tests in the turbulent atmosphere requires a deep understanding of destructive phenomena in all stages of the experiment .",
    "this includes generation , transmission and detection of nonclassical light . fading effects , i.e. fluctuating losses , cf .",
    "refs  @xcite , absorption , and noise events originated from dark counts or stray light results in diminishing the nonlocal properties of the transfered light .    in the bell - like experiment implemented in the @xmath0 atmospheric channel  @xcite",
    ", the scenario of copropagation has been studied . in that case two entangled photons were sent in the same direction from the transmitter to the receiver with a temporal separation , which is much smaller than the characteristic time scales of atmospheric variations .",
    "such fading channels can be considered as having correlated transmittances . for",
    "this scenario the turbulence may even improve measured values of the bell parameter  @xcite .",
    "this effect can be easily explained by the fact that correlated counts from the source are more likely to be detected when the channel is randomly transparent . on the other hand , for the events with low transmittances",
    "the detection of simultaneous noise clicks occurs with lower probabilities .",
    "multi - photon pairs from the parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) sources  @xcite and noise counts lead also to the appearance of so - called double - click events , which make it impossible to ascribe a definite value of the qubit for the corresponding measurements  @xcite . the exclusion of such events from the consideration may lead to lower security of qkd protocols .",
    "instead , one assigns to the corresponding qubit a random value .",
    "this technique , usually referred to as squash model  @xcite , enables one to perform a consistent mapping of the continuous variable pdc states onto the discrete - variable qubit states .    in the present paper",
    "we address three issues .",
    "first , we show that the uncorrelated fading channels in the scenario of counterpropagating radiation fields can still preserve the nonlocal properties better than the comparable deterministic - loss channels implemented , e.g. , with optical fibers .",
    "we demonstrate that the corresponding improvements are feasible only in the presence of multi - photon entangled pairs .",
    "second , we study how the incorporation of double - click events in the framework of the corresponding squash models influences the feasibility of checking the bell nonlocality in turbulent - atmosphere channels .",
    "third , we consider a postselection procedure , which enables us to verify the bell nonlocality in the case of relatively intense stray light and dark counts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ squashing ] we derive relations for the correlation coefficients and bell parameters in the presence of double - click events and for scenarios of copropagating and counterpropagating fields . in sec .",
    "[ copropagation ] we analyze the effect of double - click events on the bell nonlocality in the case of copropagation .",
    "the case of counterpropagation is considered in sec .",
    "[ counterpropagation ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : post - processing ] we consider a postselection procedure , which enables us to improve the violations of bell inequalities . in sec .",
    "[ summaryandconclusions ] we summarize our results and give some conclusions .",
    "let us recall the physical background of the bell nonlocality tests in the atmospheric channels  @xcite .",
    "we distinguish between two scenarios : the first one with different modes of the entangled light copropagating in the same direction and the second one with the modes being counterpropagating , cf .",
    "[ scheme ] .",
    "the pdc source generates the entangled photons , which are sent through the turbulent atmosphere to the receivers @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in the copropagation scenario",
    "one photon is sent directly and another one through a delay line to the corresponding receiver . there",
    "the photons are analyzed with the polarization analyzers .",
    "each of them consists of a half - wave plate , @xmath3 , rotating the polarization by the angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the polarizing beam splitters , @xmath6 , and the click detectors for the transmission and reflection channels , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the scheme of copropagation additionally includes the @xmath9 beam splitter , @xmath10 , which randomly selects photons propagating to the receivers @xmath1 and @xmath2 with the unavoidable introduction of @xmath11 deterministic losses , cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite . in the scenario of counterpropagation",
    ", the entangled photons are sent in different directions through different atmospheric channels .",
    "the photons reach the receivers @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where they are analyzed with the corresponding polarization analyzers .    if the detector @xmath7 in the corresponding transmission channel clicks , this means that the incoming photon is linearly polarized with the angle @xmath12 . if the detector @xmath13 in the corresponding reflection channel clicks , the incoming photon is assumed to be polarized in the orthogonal direction . for our purposes",
    "it is important to count the simultaneous clicks on the sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 in order to reconstruct the frequencies @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",

    "the bell inequality can be violated . for such nonclassical fields the correlation properties are incompatible with those of any local model",
    ". the violation of inequality ( [ bellineq ] ) certifies the presence of nonlocal quantum correlations of light .",
    "the analysis of the bell - nonlocality test requires the derivation of the joint probabilities , @xmath25 , for the detection of the photons at the receiver sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the derivation of these quantities can be performed on the similar footing as it was done in ref .",
    "however , here we should not omit the double clicks , i.e. , such events that detectors in transmission and reflection channels click simultaneously at least in one site , @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "this may happen due to the stray light , dark counts and multi - photon pairs . according to the photodetection theory  @xcite we can write the joint probabilities of photon detection as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the density operator and @xmath28 are the positive operator - valued measures for the on / off detectors @xmath29 related to the absence and presence of detection events , respectively . here",

    "details of calculations can be found in appendix  [ app : bell states ] .",
    "the scenario of copropagation , which is represented in fig .  [ scheme](a ) and experimentally studied in @xcite , is characterized by a very short time interval between two entangled pulses .",

    "indeed , from the cauchy - schwarz inequality it follows that @xmath91 .",

    "@xcite this property has been theoretically considered by neglecting the double - click events , i.e. eq .",
    "( [ probabilitysquash ] ) has been taken without the last three terms , see also appendix  [ app : ndubleclicks ] .",

    "they significantly contribute to the double - click events .",
    "we ascribe to each such event a random value of the corresponding qubit .",
    "this protocol is characterized by classical probabilities and it certainly diminishes the nonclassical correlations between the sites @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",

    "results of the corresponding calculations are presented in fig .",
    "there is a standard behavior , which consists in decreasing the value of the bell parameter with growing contributions from multi - photon pairs . in the scenario which does not incorporate double - click events , cf .",
    "appendix  [ app : ndubleclicks ] , this decreasing behavior is not significant : the measured value of bell parameter is much higher compared with the case of deterministic - loss channels .",
    "the situation is dramatically changed in the case of incorporating the double - click events . in the corresponding scenario",
    "the advantages of fading are not really essential in many cases , particularly for strong losses as it appears for the strong - turbulence channel . however , still for the weak - to - moderate turbulence channel , fading leads to a better result compared with the deterministic losses if the source is weak , i.e. for small values of the squeezing parameter @xmath42 .",
    "this implies that under such conditions advantages of fading can still be used .",
    "in cases when verifications of the bell nonlocality is impossible , one can try to improve the situation with a certain postselection procedure , using the technique proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for this purpose",
    "one sends intense light pulses in each channel , before the series of nonclassical - light pulses . with these pulses one can test the channel and then postselect the events with transmittances , @xmath103 , exceeding a certain postselection threshold , @xmath104 , see fig .",

    "the calculations for the postselection procedure are performed with the pdt given in eq .",
    "( [ pdt_ps ] ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath110 is the probability that the transmittances exceed the value of @xmath104 in both channels .",
    "this quantity characterizes the feasibility of the postselection procedure .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we represent the dependence of the bell parameter on the postselection efficiency @xmath104 . under the considered conditions the verification of the bell nonlocality is impossible without the postselection procedure due to the large dark - count and stray - light noise , characterized by the noise intensity , @xmath35 .",
    "the postselection procedure certainly improves the situation . in the case of the strong - turbulence channel",
    "it may sufficiently increase the bell parameter with reasonable values of @xmath111 .",
    "however , in the case of the weak - to - moderate turbulence channel the result of such a postselection appears to be much weaker .",
    "to conclude , we note that the incorporation of double - click events as well as the absence of correlations in the transmittances are certainly destructive factors for verifications of bell nonlocality in the turbulent atmosphere . in this paper we have theoretically studied the corresponding experiment with two types of channels : 1.6 km channel with the weak - to - moderate turbulent conditions and 144 km channel with the strong turbulence . in both cases we have found that the incorporation of double - click events does not destroy advantages of fading channels in the scenario of copropagation .",
