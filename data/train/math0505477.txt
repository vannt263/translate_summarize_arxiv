    "the representation dimension of an artin algebra was defined by m.auslander @xcite as a way of measuring homologically how far an algebra is from being of finite representation type .",
    "( for the precise definition see section [ sec - defs ] below . ) in fact , auslander showed that the representation dimension of an algebra is at most 2 if and only if the algebra has finite representation type , i.e. has only finitely many indecomposable modules ( up to isomorphism ) .    for more than two decades it remained unclear whether auslander s philosophy and hopes were justified , one of the main problems being that the precise value of the representation dimension of an algebra is very hard to determine . for instance ,",
    "until the late 1990 s there were still only very few examples of algebras known with representation dimension 3 , and not a single algebra with representation dimension @xmath5 .",
    "this situation changed dramatically over the last few years , with spectacular recent progress which we briefly mention here .",
    "o.iyama proved that the representation dimension is always finite @xcite .",
    "this integer attached to any algebra is actually an invariant under various notions and levels of equivalences of algebras . as it is defined , the representation dimension is invariant under morita equivalences . in modern representation theory",
    "the notions of stable equivalences and especially derived equivalences became increasingly important .",
    "it was recently shown by x.guo @xcite that the representation dimension is invariant under stable equivalences .",
    "( for stable equivalences of morita type this was already shown by c.xi @xcite . ) in particular , for selfinjective algebras the representation dimension is invariant under derived equivalences , thus providing one of the few explicit invariants of derived module categories known so far .",
    "a breakthrough was obtained by r.rouquier @xcite ( but see also the new revised version @xcite ) . as a consequence of a deep general theory of dimensions of triangulated categories he obtained the first examples of algebras with representation dimension @xmath5 , solving one of the most fundamental open questions about this invariant .",
    "much more than that , rouquier obtained that the representation dimension is unbounded , by showing that for any @xmath6 the exterior algebra of an @xmath7-dimensional vector space has representation dimension @xmath8 .",
    "actually , the methods used there indicate a very geometric nature of the representation dimension in these cases , and from this approach one can expect many more explicit examples in the near future",
    ".    these recent results finally make it clear that auslander s philosophy of measuring how far an algebra is from being of finite representation type is working ; we get a new division of algebras according to the size of their representation dimension . note that this new division certainly does not run along the lines of the classical division into finite , tame and wild representation type .",
    "for instance , already auslander showed that all finite - dimensional hereditary algebras have representation dimension at most 3 , not depending on their representation type .",
    "there is something completely new to be discovered !",
    "so far , it remains mysterious in general what structural properties of an algebra actually determine the representation dimension . in this paper",
    ", we will provide more examples of algebras of wild representation type having representation dimension 3 .",
    "our main motivation comes from group algebras .",
    "it is well known that the representation type of a modular group algebra @xmath9 of a finite group over a field @xmath1 of characteristic @xmath10 is determined by a sylow @xmath10-subgroup @xmath11 of @xmath12 @xcite : @xmath9 has finite representation type if and only if @xmath11 is cyclic ; @xmath9 has tame representation type precisely when @xmath13 and @xmath11 is dihedral , semidihedral or quaternion . in all other cases",
    "@xmath9 has wild representation type .",
    "hence , in the cyclic case , the representation dimension of @xmath9 is at most 2 .",
    "it is also known that all group algebras of tame representation type ( and related algebras ) have representation dimension 3 .",
    "( unfortunately , there is no complete proof in the literature , but see @xcite , and @xcite,4.4.2 . )    from rouquier s work one gets that for any @xmath6 the mod 2 group algebra of an elementary abelian group @xmath14 of order @xmath15 has representation dimension @xmath8 .",
    "one could hope that the geometric methods used could be adapted and generalized to deal with elementary abelian @xmath10-groups in odd characteristic as well . however , these geometric methods do not work for elementary abelian groups of rank 2 .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to give some partial results on the rank 2 case , thus providing the first examples to fill this rank-2-gap. note that the mod @xmath10 group algebra of @xmath16 is isomorphic to the commutative ring @xmath2/(x^{p^m } , y^{p^n})$ ] .",
    "so the natural class of algebras to study are the commutative rings @xmath17/(x^m , y^n)$ ] , for natural numbers @xmath18 .",
    "our main result in this paper gives the precise value of the representation dimension for the algebras @xmath19 .",
    "note that this result is independent of the ground field .",
    "[ mainthm ] let @xmath1 be a field and let @xmath20/(x^2 , y^{2+n})$ ] for every non - negative integer @xmath7 .",
    "then the representation dimension of @xmath21 is 3 .    as a consequence",
    "we get the following partial answer on the rank-2-gap for group algebras .",
    "[ cor - groups ] let @xmath1 be a field of characteristic 2 .",
    "then for any @xmath22 the group algebra @xmath23 has representation dimension 3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - defs ]",
    "we recall the necessary definitions and background on representation dimensions .",
    "in particular , we outline the method for determining the precise value of the representation dimension .",
    "the final section [ sec - main ] then contains the proof of the main result .",
    "the representation dimension has been defined by m.auslander @xcite for arbitrary artin algebras . however , for the purpose of this paper , by an algebra we mean a finite - dimensional algebra over a fixed field @xmath1 .",
    "( it will turn out that our results will not depend on the ground field . )    a finitely generated @xmath24-module @xmath25 is called a _",
    "generator - cogenerator _ for @xmath24 if all projective indecomposable modules and all injective indecomposable @xmath24-modules occur as direct summands of @xmath25 .",
    "auslander s basic idea was to study homological properties of endomorphism rings of modules ( instead of studying modules directly ) . for any algebra @xmath24 the _ representation dimension _",

    "more precisely , @xmath30 if and only if @xmath24 is semisimple , and @xmath31 for all algebras @xmath24 .",
    "the definition indicates how to determine upper bounds for @xmath28 ; in fact , if one can show for some generator - cogenerator @xmath25 that @xmath32 then @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , if one can find a generator - cogenerator @xmath25 with @xmath34 , and if @xmath24 is not of finite representation type , then one has shown that @xmath35 . of course , the notoriously difficult problem is to find a suitable module @xmath25 .    however , this is exactly the strategy we will pursue successfully in the proof of our main theorem .",
    "we will explain in section [ sec - main ] below how to construct inductively generator - cogenerators for the algebras @xmath2/(x^2,y^{2+n})$ ] with endomorphism rings of global dimension 3 .",
    "we now describe the general method used later for how to determine the global dimension of the endomorphism ring of a generator - cogenerator @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath25 be a finitely generated module over a finite - dimensional algebra @xmath24 .",
    "the identity of @xmath36 is the sum of the  identity maps \" on the indecomposable direct summands of @xmath25 .",

    "the crucial aspect in this strategy is to come up with a generator - cogenerator @xmath25 for which this process really stops at this stage , i.e. for which @xmath60 in the second step above .",

    "actually , in order to prove theorem [ mainthm ] it suffices to show that @xmath68 , due to the following general result . recall that an algebra @xmath24 is called _ basic _ if all simple @xmath24-modules are of dimension 1 .",
    "note that our algebras @xmath2/(x^2,y^{2+n})$ ] are basic since the trivial module @xmath1 is the only simple module .",
