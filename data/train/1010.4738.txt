    "the inclusive direct ( prompt ) photon production in hadronic collisions has been quite useful for accessing information on parton distributions in hadrons .",
    "moreover , direct photons appears to be an useful probe of the initial state of matter created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "their interaction with the medium is purely electromagnetic , which gives a baseline for the interpretation of jet - quenching models . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "the prompt photon production is reasonably described in the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite and on the color dipole formalism @xcite as well .",
    "recently , the first measurements of inclusive photon production in association with heavy flavour jets have been reported by d0 collaboration @xcite .",
    "such a process provide important information on the parton content of the initial state hadrons as it is sensitive to charm ( bottom ) and gluon densities within the colliding hadrons .    in pqcd the inclusive production of prompt photons plus a heavy flavour quark @xcite",
    "is driven by the qcd compton scattering , @xmath4 , and also receives contribution from quark - antiquark annihilation process , @xmath5 .",
    "this is the reason of such a process to be sensitive to the heavy quark and gluon content of hadron , which have considerable uncertainties .",
    "the data description was found to be fairly good @xcite for large transverse momenta photons , where a perturbative approach is completely justifiable . on the other hand ,",
    "the same process can be addressed in the target rest frame @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the direct photon production is viewed as an electromagnetic bremsstrahlung of a ( light or heavy ) quark that interacts with the target via gluonic exchanges .",
    "this idea has been used to describe tevatron data on prompt photon production at midrapidities using light quarks contribution @xcite .",
    "investigations of such formalism in association with aspects of saturation physics , for instance the color glass condensate framework @xcite , have been made for @xmath6 and @xmath7 collisions in a number of works @xcite .    in this work",
    "we apply the target rest frame formalism to photon plus heavy quark production cross section in high energies .",
    "the dependence of the production cross section on the final state particle rapidities and transverse momenta is investigated . in next section",
    "we introduce the main formulae to compute the hadronic differential cross section .",
    "it is already known from previous studies @xcite that the photon transverse momentum spectrum is a sensitive probe of color dipole scattering cross section .",
    "we investigate the consequence of using several implementations of dipole cross sections which are constrained from deep inelastic scattering data .",
    "the theoretical results are compared to tevatron measurements for the @xmath8 x production cross sections .",
    "an analysis for proton - proton and proton - lead collisions at the lhc regime is also developed . in order to do so",
    ", we will rely on geometric scaling arguments to do the transition from a nucleon to a nucleus target .",
    "the numerical results are discussed in detail in last section .",
    "in this section we summarize the relevant formulae to compute the @xmath9 production cross section at small-@xmath10 regime in the target rest frame .",
    "such an approach has been early developed by kopeliovich @xcite to the drell - yan production in the context of nuclear shadowing and further developed in @xcite .",
    "here , it will be considered that the photon transverse momentum is large compared to the hadronic scale , @xmath11 , and at the same time smaller than the hadronic center - of - mass energy , @xmath12 . in the target rest frame",
    "the production process is viewed as follows . a large-@xmath10 heavy quark ( or heavy antiquark ) of the hadron projectile scatters off the gluonic field of the hadron target and radiates a real photon .",
    "the relevant diagrams are those where the photon is radiated before or after the interaction with the target , whereas diagrams involving the quarks interacting with the target both before and after the photon vertex are suppressed in the high energy limit .",
    "although in the process of electromagnetic bremsstrahlung by a heavy - quark no quark - antiquark dipole participates , we soon observe that the cross section can be expressed via the elementary dipole cross section , @xmath13 , of interaction of a @xmath14 dipole with a target .",
    "this allows us to make use of the extensive phenomenology on deep - inelastic scattering where the dipole cross section is very well determined from data on small-@xmath10 region @xcite .",
    "the scattering cross section for production of a massless on - shell quark with momentum @xmath15 and a real photon with momentum @xmath16 was derived in @xcite .",

    "the momentum fraction @xmath36 is related to the photon and final state quark rapidities and transverse momenta as follows @xcite : @xmath37    in order to compute the hadronic cross section for photon plus heavy quark production it is needed to convolute the partonic cross section , eq .",

    "therefore , the differential cross section for the hadronic production is given by , @xmath39    the charm and bottom pdfs are presently assumed to be radiatively generated and then are related to the gluon pdf through dglap evolution equations .",
    "it is noticed that the charm structure function at large-@xmath10 measured by emc collaboration suggests that there might be an intrinsic charm ( ic ) component in nucleon . in general ,",
    "nonperturbative models are considered to describe such a component ( see , for instance refs .",
    "those models are not considered here . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) , the difference between charm and bottom comes from the quark charge , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and from the quark pdf ( charm pdf is larger than the bottom one ) . for the factorization / renormalization scale , @xmath42 ,",
    "the photon transverse momentum is usually chosen .    to proceed further",
    ", we need to know the quantity @xmath43 .",
    "it can be computed numerically using the available phenomenological dipole cross sections @xcite . here",
    ", we consider some of them that have been used to describe deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data and rhic data as well .",
    "we can gain some physical insight using analytical versions of the amplitude @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , considering small dipole configurations ( which is the typical configuration for large @xmath44 considered in the current study ) the color dipole amplitude behaves like @xmath45 .",
    "such an expression is typical in saturation models based on the qcd nonlinear evolution equations for the dipole amplitude and its behavior is known as geometric scaling on the variable @xmath46 .",
    "the intrinsic momentum scale , @xmath47 , is the so - called saturation scale ( for central rapidities at tevatron , @xmath48 gev ) .",
    "for some fixed values of the anomalous dimension , @xmath49 , the zeroth - order hankel transform in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs_def ] ) can be done analytically considering @xmath50 . in ref .",

    "thus , it is important to consider dipole models where the anomalous dimension is running .",
    "this is named extended geometric scaling property . for a running anomalous dimension which does not depend explicitly on the dipole size @xmath32",
    ", it can be obtained the following @xcite : @xmath57 where we consider two models for the running anomalous dimension , which have been confronted to rhic data on charged particle multiplicities .",

    "@xcite , despite any particular assumptions on the dipole amplitude the factor in denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs_gen2 ] ) diverges as the momenta of produced quark and photon are parallel , @xmath83 , which is the usual collinear divergence present in perturbation theory .",

    ", we are using the target rest frame approach in the limit of its validity in the tevatron regime .",
    "formally , this approach is valid at small-@xmath36 , see eq .",

    "let us now comment on the numerical results for theoretical approaches considered here . as already found in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nlo pqcd calculation describes in good agreement the bottom data .",
    "however , the large @xmath24 range of charm data is underestimated and it seems to favor a ic component which would be important at that region . on the other hand ,",
    "the target rest frame approach produces distinct results depending on the input for the dipole cross section .",
    "the jb parameterization is close to the nlo pqcd ( the anomalous dimension for jb is near the dglap one as it is derived in the double logarithmic , dll , limit of bfkl approach ) for charm and deviates from pqcd at @xmath104 60 gev for the bottom case .",
    "a weak reason could be due the fact we are considering the strong coupling fixed , @xmath105 , in jb parameterization for both cases and a distinct bottom pdf .",
    "we have checked that it is not the case .",
    "probably , the deviation does come from the relative contribution of a set of diagrams that are not accounted for in the target rest frame approach compared to pqcq .",
    "for instance , it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the annihilation process @xmath106 is very important at large @xmath24 for the bottom case .",
    "the target rest frame approach only involves the compton subprocess and can not be directly compared to the nlo pqcd calculation .",
    "the buw and dhj parameterizations differ not only in the scaling behavior , but in the way the large @xmath44 limit of @xmath107 approaches to one .",
    "this last feature leads to different large momentum slopes of dipole amplitude and therefore to distinct predictions for the large @xmath24-slope when using eqs .",
