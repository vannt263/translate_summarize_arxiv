    "multiple - input multiple - output or mimo wireless systems have received a significant amount of interest due to their capability of dramatically increasing the capacity of a communication link  @xcite .",
    "also , there has been considerable work on a variety of schemes which exploit multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver in order to obtain spatial diversity , i.e. to improve the reliability of the system such as orthogonal space - time block codes ( ostbc )  @xcite and space - time trellis codes  @xcite ( sttc ) .",
    "an simple example for a sttc is the delay diversity code , first proposed in  @xcite and also discussed in  @xcite , where the data stream on the first transmit antenna is transmitted with delays on the other antennas .",
    "the delay diversity code achieves full diversity but has a disadvantage of a slight rate loss due to some leading and tailing zeros . in order to avoid this drawback",
    ", cyclic delay diversity ( cdd ) has been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of cdd over ostbc is that a code rate of one is achieved independent of the number of transmit antennas , whereas ostbc suffer a rate loss by increasing the number of transmit antennas  @xcite .",
    "the performance of cdd in terms of error probability was analyzed in@xcite for frequency flat and frequency selective channels .",
    "the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff for delay diversity was characterized in  @xcite .",
    "based on the assumption that statistical information about the channel is available at the transmitter , transmit filters employed at the transmitter are optimized in  @xcite in order to minimize the chernoff bound on the error probability of cdd . the average rate for cdd by assuming gaussian as well as psk / qam input signals for a point - to - point transmission with @xmath0 or @xmath1 transmit antennas and @xmath2 receive antennas was investigated in terms of monte - carlo simulations in  @xcite .",
    "as noticed in  @xcite , most of the work on space - time coding so far is focused on single - user systems .",
    "for such single - user systems , it was shown that the loss in terms of spectral efficiency for transmit diversity schemes increases significantly for more than one receive antenna  @xcite , making them inappropriate for high rate transmission . in this work , by assuming a gaussian codebook , we analyze the ergodic rate performance of a multiple access channel ( mac ) system with multiple users transmitting their data to the base station by using a cdd . at the receiver ,",
    "we apply a joint maximum - likelihood ( ml ) detector .",
    "we compare the achieved ergodic sum - rate with the sum - capacity of a mac system assuming that the users do not have channel state information ( csi ) and the base station has full csi .",
    "we show that , if the number of receive antennas @xmath3 is less than the number of users @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath5 in the system ( which is a reasonable assumption ) , the loss of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency is negligible .",
    "this is in strong contrast to single - user systems  @xcite .",
    "thus , cdd is indeed an attractive candidate for transmit strategies in mimo multi - user systems .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "system ] , we introduce the system model and the construction of the cdd . the performance of cdd in terms of spectral efficiency is then analyzed and compared to the sum - capacity in section  [ sec : perfan ] , followed by simulations and concluding remarks in section  [ sec : simu ] and  [ sec : conc ] .",

    "we focus on delay optimal codes , in the sense that the decoding is performed after @xmath20 channel uses with @xmath24@xcite .",
    "the channel between user @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and the base station is modeled by a random zero - mean component channel @xmath27 ( @xmath28 $ ] ) with identically independent distributed ( iid ) complex gaussian entries , i.e. @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",

    "the separation of these two cases is motivated by the fact that the spectral efficiency for transmit diversity schemes in single - user systems with one receiving antenna is close to ( e.g. qstbc ) or even equal to capacity ( alamouti scheme )  @xcite . with more than one receive antenna",
