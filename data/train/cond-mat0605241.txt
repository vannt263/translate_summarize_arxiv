    "understanding of atomic transport in multicomponent solids has been a longstanding challenge @xcite-@xcite . in particular , the problem of interdiffusion in binary metallic alloys ( as well as other types of mixed crystals ) is very intricate : there is a delicate interplay between kinetic aspects that have a complicated energetics ( such as jump rates of the various kinds of atoms to available vacant sites ) and effects due to non - random arrangement of these atoms on the lattice sites ( a problem which needs to be considered in the framework of statistical thermodynamics @xcite ) .",
    "even the simplistic limiting case of perfectly random occupation of the sites of a rigid perfect lattice by two atomic species ( @xmath14 ) and a small fraction of vacancies ( @xmath1 ) , where one assumes constant jump rates @xmath15 of the two types of atoms to the vacant sites ( i.e. jump rates that do not depend on the occupation of the sites surrounding the vacant sites ) , is highly nontrivial @xcite .",
    "one finds that neither the self - diffusion coefficients @xmath16 nor the interdiffusion coefficient @xmath17 can be analytically reliably predicted , given @xmath18 and the average concentration @xmath19 ; nor does a simple relation between @xmath16 and @xmath17 exist @xcite .",
    "recently , attention has been focused on this problem because of several fascinating developments : ( i ) progress with the electronic structure calculations of vacancy formation energies , jump rates etc . as well as better understanding of short range order parameters in alloys puts the `` first - principles '' calculation of interdiffusion and self - diffusion coefficients in ordered solid alloys such as @xmath20 within reach @xcite .",
    "( ii ) progress with the atom - tracking scanning tunnelling microscopy observation of atomic motions in two - dimensional surface alloys such as in atoms in cu(001 ) surfaces @xcite or pd atoms in cu(001 ) surfaces @xcite has provided compelling direct evidence for the operation of vacancy mediated surface diffusion .",
    "this is a nontrivial result , since competing mechanisms ( surface atoms leave the topmost atomic layer to become adatoms on top of this layer @xcite , or direct exchange between neighboring surface atoms , `` assisted '' by the free space above the topmost monolayer of atoms at the crystal surface ) can not be ruled out a priori .",
    "of course , this finding enforces the hypothesis that vacancy mechanism dominates self- and interdiffusion processes in crystal lattices in the bulk @xcite .    in the present work we try to contribute to this problem , emphasizing the statistical mechanics approach by considering again a rigid lattice model but allowing for interactions causing a nontrivial long range order ( or , at least , short range order ) between the atoms in the system .",
    "we are not addressing a specific material , but rather try to elucidate the generic phenomena caused by the interplay of local correlations in the occupancy of lattice sites and the disparities in the jump rates @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the two species .",
    "thus , our model is close in spirit to the work in ref .",
    "@xcite and employs a related monte carlo simulation methodology @xcite . unlike @xcite",
    ", the present model does include a nearest - neighbor attraction between unlike neighbors , and thus nontrivial static order - disorder phenomena occur .",
    "as expected , we shall demonstrate that the resulting correlations in the occupancy of the lattice sites have a drastic effect on the transport phenomena , and hence can not be neglected when one tries to interpret real data .",
    "we also emphasize that these correlation phenomena need a treatment beyond mean field level .",
    "we point out this fact , because sometimes a first principle electronic structure calculation is combined with statistical mechanics of mean field type or the cluster variation method @xcite , and such approximations then clearly spoil the desirable rigor .",
    "we also note that similar models as studied here have been frequently used to study domain growth in alloys that are quenched from the high temperature phase to a temperature below the order - disorder transition temperature @xcite .    in section",
    "ii we describe our ( two - dimensional ) model .",
    "we restrict the present work to two - dimensional systems , since recently there has been great interest in two - dimensional alloys @xcite , and we hope that extensions of our modelling can make contact with corresponding experiments . in section iii",
    "we summarize our simulation methodology , while section iv briefly reviews some pertinent theoretical concepts and approximations we wish to test .",
    "section v describes our numerical results , while section vi summarizes our conclusions , and gives an outlook to future work .",
    "having in mind the application of our work to two - dimensional surface alloys , we assume a perfect square lattice of adsorption sites ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "these adsorption sites can either be taken by an a - atom , a b - atom , or a vacancy .",
    "therefore this model traditionally is also referred to as the abv model @xcite .",
    "it can also be viewed as an extension of simple lattice gas models , where diffusion of a single species ( a ) occurs by hopping to vacant sites , to two components .",
    "diffusion in lattice gases with a single species has been extensively studied @xcite , but diffusion in a two - component lattice gas so far has been thoroughly examined only in the noninteracting case @xcite . here",
    "we restrict attention to a model with strictly pairwise interactions between nearest neighbors only , which we denote as @xmath23 and @xmath24 pairs .",
    "however , in general one can consider also energy parameters between pairs of lattice sites involving one ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) or two ( @xmath27 ) vacancies , but here we do not consider the @xmath28 model in full generality , but only the special case @xmath29 , although from first principles electronic structure calculations there is evidence that nonzero @xmath30 may occur @xcite . while all these parameters affect the diffusion behavior of the model , actually only a subset of them controls the static behavior .",
    "with respect to static properties of this model , the well - known transcription to the spin@xmath31 blume - emery - griffiths model shows ( see e.g. @xcite ) , that for constant concentrations only three interaction parameters would be needed . note that",
    "although there are three concentration variables , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , due to the constraint @xmath34 only two of them are independent . actually , the physically most interesting case is the limit @xmath35 , since in thermal equilibrium the concentration of vacancies is very small . in the noninteracting case @xcite , it was found that many aspects of this limiting behavior @xmath35 are already reproduced if the vacancy concentration is of the order of a few percent only , e.g. @xmath36 , and in fact we shall adopt this choice in the case of the present simulations .",
    "also for the interacting case the limit @xmath35 greatly simplifies matters , since then , with respect to static properties , we have to consider only a single energy parameter @xmath37 , defined by    @xmath38    if @xmath39 , the model in thermal equilibrium will exhibit ordering , while for @xmath40 , phase separation occurs @xcite . in the case of a square lattice , the model in the limit @xmath41 is equivalent to the two - dimensional ising model , for which some static properties of interest are exactly known @xcite .",
    "in particular , for @xmath42 the critical temperature @xmath43 is known exactly , namely @xmath44^{-1 } \\approx 1.1345 .\\ ] ] this is the maximum value of the critical temperature curve @xmath45 at which the order - disorder phase transition occurs . according to the well - known bragg - williams mean - field approximation",
    ", one would rather obtain @xmath46 than the result implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , @xmath47 @xcite . here and in the following ,",
    "the maximum value @xmath48 of the pure model without vacancies is simply denoted as @xmath43 . however , an even more important failure of the mean field theory is the prediction that an order - disorder transition from the disordered phase to a phase with long - range checkerboard order occurs over the entire concentration range , with @xmath49 , see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of mean field theory . as a matter of fact ,",
    "long range order is only possible for a much more restricted range of concentrations , namely @xcite @xmath50 ( note that the pairwise character of the interactions implies a symmetry of the phase diagram around the line @xmath51 , in the limit @xmath35 @xcite ) .",
    "if we work with a small but nonzero concentration of vacancies @xmath33 , the maximum critical temperature no longer occurs at @xmath52 , but rather at @xmath53 , and the phase diagram is in this case symmetric around this concentration @xmath54 .",
    "apart from this statement , there are no longer any exact results available , but it is fairly straightforward to obtain the phase diagram from standard monte carlo methods @xcite with an accuracy that is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows our estimates of the phase boundary for @xmath36 , in comparison with previous results for @xmath55 .",
    "as has been well documented in the literature @xcite , such phase diagrams are conveniently mapped out by transforming the model to a magnetic ising spin model ( representing the cases that lattice site @xmath56 is taken by an @xmath57atom by spin up , @xmath58atom by spin down , respectively ) and considering the transition from the paramagnetic to the antiferromagnetic phase for various magnetic fields @xmath59 ( @xmath60 , if @xmath61 , and with @xmath62 and @xmath63 being the chemical potentials of @xmath64 and @xmath58 particles , respectively ) .",
    "estimating then the magnetization @xmath65 at the phase boundary , one then obtains the corresponding critical concentrations from @xmath66 fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that for @xmath36 the maximum critical temperature occurs for @xmath67 , and for @xmath68 the phase boundary ends at the concentrations @xmath69 .",
    "as it should be , the phase diagram is symmetric around @xmath70 .",
    "the analysis indicates that the order - disorder transition stays second order throughout , also in the presence of this small vacancy concentration .",
    "although it is clear that a vacancy concentration of @xmath36 does have some clearly visible effects , in comparison to the model with @xmath71 , these changes do not affect the qualitative character of the phase behavior , but cause only minor modifications of quantitative details . for obtaining accurate results on the dynamic behavior of the model with a modest amount of computing time , working with sufficiently many vacancies on the lattice",
    "is mandatory .",
    "note that for the diffusion studies we use a lattice of linear dimensions @xmath72 , while the static phase diagram was extracted from a standard finite size scaling analysis @xcite , see figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] for an example , using sizes @xmath73 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied throughout .",
    "the static quantities that were analyzed in order to obtain the phase boundary are the antiferromagnetic order parameter @xmath74 ( we refer here to the transformation of the model to the ising spin representation again ) @xmath75 where @xmath76 label the lattice sites in @xmath77 and @xmath78 direction , respectively .",
    "similarly , the magnetization @xmath79 is given by averaging all the spins without a phase factor @xmath80 and the susceptibility @xmath81 and staggered susceptibility @xmath82 are obtained from the standard fluctuation relations @xmath83 @xmath84 note that in a finite system in the absence of symetry - breaking fields one needs to work with the average of the absolute value @xmath85 rather than @xmath86 in order to have a meaningful order parameter @xcite .",
    "a further quantity useful for finding the location of the transition is the fourth order cumulant of the order parameter @xcite @xmath87 \\ , , \\ ] ] since the critical temperature can be found from the intersection of the cumulants plotted versus temperature for different lattice sizes .",
    "for the two - dimensional ising universality class , this intersection should occur for a value @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that this expectation is only rather roughly fulfilled . to some extent",
    "this may be attributed to statistical errors , but in addition probably for @xmath89 there are somewhat larger corrections to finite size scaling than for the `` pure '' model ( i.e. , the model without vacancies ) .",
    "we have hence estimated @xmath90 alternatively from a plot of the temperatures @xmath91 , where the maximum of @xmath92 for finite @xmath93 occurs , versus the finite size scaling variable @xmath94 ( remember @xmath95 in the two - dimensional ising model @xcite ) , see fig .  [ fig4]a . the quality of the finite size scaling `` data collapse '' of the order parameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) gives us confidence in the reliability of our procedures .",
    "we emphasize that the present paper concerns only the choice of the symmetric case , @xmath61 .",
    "while any asymmetry between @xmath64 and @xmath96 , leading to @xmath97 , has little effect on static properties for small @xmath33 , the distribution of the vacancies and their dynamics may get strongly affected by such an asymmetry @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention a static quantity that plays a role in discussing the self - diffusion coefficient of particles in lattice gas models , the so - called `` vacancy availability factor '' @xcite @xmath98 here @xmath99 is the standard cowley - warren short range order parameter @xcite for the nearest neighbor shell of a particle : @xmath100 if there is a random occupation of the lattice sites by any particles and vacancies ( note that here we are not concerned with short range order describing the non - random occupation of @xmath64 versus @xmath96 particles on the lattice .",
    "due to the symmetry @xmath101 , there is also no need to consider separate vacancy availability factors for @xmath64 and @xmath96 particles ) .",
    "actually , we expect that in the limit @xmath102 also @xmath103 , and then @xmath104 .",
    "hence a calculation of @xmath105 can serve as a test whether the chosen vacancy concentration is small enough in order to reproduce the desired limit @xmath71 .",
    "the monte carlo simulations consist of an initial part , necessary to equilibrate the system for the desired conditions , and a final part , where the transport coefficients of interest are `` measured '' in the simulation . while in the case of the completely random @xmath28 alloy studied in @xcite",
    "the generation of an initial configuration is straightforward , this is not so here , because depending on where the chosen state point @xmath106 is in the phase diagram , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we have long range order or not .",
    "if the system in equilibrium is in a state where long range order occurs , it is important to prepare the system in a monodomain sample : otherwise the presence of antiphase domain boundaries @xcite might spoil the results . in particular , at very low temperature interdiffusion could be strongly enhanced near such boundaries , in comparison with the bulk .",
    "although such effects are interesting in their own right , they need separate study from bulk behavior , and are out of consideration here .",
    "actually the best way to prepare the equilibrated initial configurations , in cases where long range order is present , is the use of the `` magnetic '' representation of the model as an ising antiferromagnet in a field @xmath59 ( remember that @xmath59 physically corresponds to the chemical potential difference between @xmath64 and @xmath96 particles @xcite ) . recording the magnetization @xmath107 as function of the field",
    ", one can choose the field such that states with the desired value of @xmath79 and hence @xmath108 result .",
    "the initial spin configuration is that of a perfect antiferromagnetic structure , from which a fraction @xmath33 of sites chosen at random is removed .",
    "the monte carlo algorithm that was used is the standard single spin flip metropolis algorithm @xcite , mixed with random exchanges of the vacancies with randomly chosen neighbors .",
    "note that during this equilibration part the concentration @xmath109 is not strictly constant , but slightly fluctuating : this lack of conservation of @xmath109 is desirable , however , since `` hydrodynamic slowing down '' @xcite of long wavelength concentration fluctuations would otherwise hamper the equilibration of concentration correlations at long distances .    in the final stage of the monte carlo runs , of course ,",
    "the spin flip monte carlo moves are shut off , since for the analysis of the diffusion constants the concentrations @xmath110 need to be strictly conserved .",
    "most straightforward is the estimation of the self - diffusion coefficients ( also called  ` tracer diffusion coefficients' ) @xmath111 of tagged @xmath64 and @xmath96 particles , since there one simply can apply the einstein relation @xmath112 @xmath113 being the dimensionality of the lattice ( @xmath114 here ) , and @xmath115 being the position of the @xmath56-th particle at time @xmath116 . fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] illustrates the application of this method for a typical example , in the case @xmath117 , temperature @xmath118 ( in units of @xmath43 , eq .  [ eq2 ] ) , and concentrations @xmath119 , respectively . while the plot of @xmath120 vs. @xmath116 , for a total time of @xmath121 mcs , look at first sight almost linear ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , left part ) , a closer look reveals a slight but systematic decrease of the slope of the @xmath122 vs. @xmath116 curve with increasing time .",
    "a similar observation was already reported by kehr et al .",
    "@xcite , who attributed this decrease of slope to the presence of a logarithmic correction .",
    "specifically , it was shown that in @xmath13 the estimate @xmath123 of the tracer diffusion constants depend on the time interval @xmath124 of estimation as @xmath125 where @xmath126 are phenomenological constants .",
    "therefore we have analyzed @xmath123 as a function of @xmath124 in the present case ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , right part ) .",
    "we found rather generally that there is a significant dependence of @xmath123 on @xmath124 for @xmath127 , while for @xmath128 the dependence on @xmath124 can safely be neglected .",
    "a remarkable feature of the results also is that the faster b particles exhibit ( in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) a diffusion constant that is only about a factor of three larger than the slower a particles , while the jump rate is a factor of 100 larger .",
    "this fact already indicates that there is no straightforward relation between the tracer diffusion constants and the jump rates .",
    "in the description of collective diffusion , the onsager coefficients @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 play a central role , since they appear as coefficients in the linear relations between particle currents @xmath133 and the corresponding driving forces , the gradients of the potential differences between a ( or b ) particles and vacancies v , respectively @xcite : @xmath134 @xmath135 note that due to the symmetry relation @xmath136 only three of these four onsager coefficients are thought to be independent .",
    "there is no simple relation between the two jump rates @xmath15 ( and temperature t and the concentrations @xmath19 ) and these three onsager coefficients @xmath137 , of course .",
    "hence it is a task of the simulation to estimate these onsager coefficients , and it is well known @xcite that this can be done by applying a force to the particles , which acts in the same way as a chemical potential gradient . due to the periodic boundary conditions , particles that leave",
    "the box at one side will reenter at the opposite one , and hence a chemical potential gradient causes a steady state flux of particles through the simulation box in the direction of this driving force .",
    "care is needed in two respects :    * one must average long enough to make sure that slow transients after the imposition of the force have died out and steady - state conditions are actually reached .",
    "* one must make sure that the applied force is small enough so one works in the region where the response of the system to this force is strictly linear , as written in eqs .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) , ( [ eq13 ] ) , and nonlinear corrections can be completely neglected .",
    "this method of estimating onsager coefficients was pioneered by murch and thorn @xcite for one - component lattice gases and extended to random alloy models in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to these papers for a more detailed justification and discussion of this method .",
    "following @xcite we implement this force on species of particles @xmath138 ( @xmath139 or @xmath96 ) by taking the jump rates in the @xmath77 direction as @xmath140 while the jump rate in the @xmath141 directions remains @xmath142 . if we would have a single particle ( s.p . ) only , the mean velocity in the @xmath143 direction would be @xmath144 , which should correspond to @xmath145 , @xmath146 being the force in @xmath77 direction , in the regime of linear response .",
    "hence one concludes that from the velocity of species @xmath147 one can deduce the onsager coefficient @xmath148 if a force @xmath146 is exerted on species @xmath138 via @xmath149 the application of this method is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . there",
    "the mean displacement @xmath150 of @xmath57 and @xmath58 particles is followed over @xmath151 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) per site , and a very good linearity of @xmath152 vs. @xmath116 is observed ( left part ) . in order to check for nonlinear effects ,",
    "the bias parameter @xmath153 is varied in the range @xmath154 , and the results are extrapolated to @xmath155 .",
    "( right part of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "consistent with previous work on the random @xmath28 model @xcite , nonlinear effects are rather weak , and in this way we are able to estimate onsager coefficients with a relative error of a few percent .",
    "still a different approach was followed to estimate the interdiffusion constant @xmath17 .",
    "we prepare a system in thermal equilibrium in the presence of a wavevector - dependent chemical potential difference @xmath156 defined as @xmath157 @xmath158 being an amplitude that needs to be chosen such that the resulting concentration variation is still in the regime where linear response holds , and @xmath159 is the wavelength of the modulation ( which is chosen such that the linear dimension @xmath93 of the lattice is an integer multiple of @xmath159 ) .",
    "note that in the ising spin representation @xmath156 simply translates in a wavelength - dependent magnetic field , of course .",
    "the system then is equilibrated in the presence of this perturbation for a large number of monte carlo steps ( of the order of @xmath160 mcs ) .",
    "this causes a corresponding periodic concentration variation , see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , left part .",
    "the sinusoidal shape of this initial concentration variation provides a confirmation that the linear response description is applicable otherwise the presence of higher harmonics in the concentration variation would indicate the presence of nonlinear effects .",
    "then a `` clock '' is set to time @xmath161 and the perturbation @xmath162 is put to zero for times @xmath163 . as a consequence , the concentration variation decays to zero as the time @xmath164 .",
    "it turns out that this decay with time can be described by a superposition of two simple exponential decays , one governing the decay of the concentration difference @xmath165 of the particles , the other corresponding to the decay of the total density . as discussed in detail for the random @xmath28 model @xcite , the concentration variation",
    "can be described therefore as ( @xmath166 , and @xmath167 are two diffusion constants ) @xmath168 @xmath169 where @xmath170 are amplitude prefactors , which one can estimate from the treatment that will be outlined in the following section .",
    "here we only mention that @xmath171 , and in the limit @xmath71 we have @xmath172 , while @xmath173 stay finite ( of the order of @xmath158 ) . in this limit the two diffusion constants @xmath174",
    "are of very different order of magnitude , since @xmath175 , while @xmath176 stays of order unity @xcite .",
    "thus density variations have a very small amplitude ( of order @xmath33 ) and decay fast , while concentration variations decay much slower .",
    "this consideration leads us to identify @xmath177 as the interdiffusion constant @xmath17 in this limit . for finite nonzero @xmath33 ,",
    "however , in principle both density and concentration variations are coupled , and both diffusion constants @xmath174 contribute to the interdiffusion of @xmath64 and @xmath96 particles @xcite .    the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] illustrates that even for @xmath33 as large as @xmath36 there is already a reasonable separation between density and concentration fluctuations : both @xmath178 and @xmath179 reach their asymptotic decay ( where only the same factor @xmath180 matters , as is evident from the fact that there are two parallel straight lines on the semilog plot ) already at a time @xmath181 , long before the concentration variations have decayed to zero .",
    "a basic ingredient of all analytical theories are the conservation laws for the numbers of a and b particles , which lead to continuity equations for the local concentrations",
    "@xmath182 @xmath183 @xmath184 note that these equations hold rigorously , if a local concentration field @xmath185 @xmath186 can be defined , unlike the so - called constitutive relations , eqs .",

    "( [ eq12]),([eq13 ] ) @xcite .",
    "we also note that in our model ( unlike real alloys , where vacancies can be created by hopping of atoms from lattice sites to interstitial sites , and where vacancies can be destroyed by hopping of interstitial atoms to a neighboring vacant site of the lattice @xcite ) also vacancies are conserved , and hence @xmath188 however , as discussed in @xcite there is no need to include @xmath189 and @xmath190 as additional dynamical variables in the problem : the condition that every lattice site is either occupied by an a - atom , b - atom or vacant ( v ) translates into the constraint @xmath191 .",
