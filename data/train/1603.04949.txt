    "a number of papers have recently considered the problem of constructing a coherent quantum observer for a quantum system ; e.g. , see @xcite . in the coherent quantum observer problem , a quantum plant",
    "is coupled to a quantum observer which is also a quantum system .",
    "the quantum observer is constructed to be a physically realizable quantum system so that the system variables of the quantum observer converge in some suitable sense to the system variables of the quantum plant . the papers @xcite considered the problem of constructing a direct coupling quantum observer for a given closed quantum system . in @xcite , the proposed observer is shown to be able to estimate some but not all of the plant variables in a time averaged sense .",
    "also , the paper @xcite shows that a possible experimental implementation of the augmented quantum plant and quantum observer system considered in @xcite may be constructed using a non - degenerate parametric amplifier ( ndpa ) which is coupled to a beamsplitter by suitable choice of the ndpa and beamsplitter parameters .    in the paper @xcite , the quantum plant consisted of a number of quantum harmonic oscillators where the number of variables to be estimated was allowed to be at most half of the total number of variables describing the quantum plant .",
    "however , the quantum plant was assumed to have very simple dynamics corresponding to a zero hamiltonian .",
    "then a quantum observer was constructed whose number of variables was equal to twice the number of variables to be estimated . in this paper",
    "we extend the results of @xcite by first allowing for more general linear quantum plants with non - zero hamiltonians .",
    "conditions are given on whether a given set of variables of interest can be estimated via a direct coupling quantum observer .",
    "then a direct coupling quantum observer is constructed whose order is the same as the number of variables to be estimated when this number is even . in the case that the number of variables to be estimated is odd , the order of the observer is one more than the number of variables to be estimated . compared to the result in @xcite , this is a reduced order observer . as in @xcite , the convergence of the observer outputs to the plant outputs is a time averaged convergence since the overall plant - observer system is a closed quantum linear system .",
    "in the quantum observer problem under consideration , both the quantum plant and the quantum observer are linear quantum systems ; see also @xcite . we will restrict attention to closed linear quantum systems which do not interact with an external environment .",
