    "in the last years , magnetized quark matter has attracted the attention of the physics community due to its relevance for heavy ion collisions at very high energies @xcite , to the understanding of the first phases of the universe @xcite and for studies involving compact objects like magnetars @xcite .    in the presence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "the behavior of quark matter is determined by the competition between two different mechanisms : the enhancement of the quark condensate because of the opening of the gap between the landau states leading to the increase of low - energy contributions to the formation of the chiral condensate ; and the suppression of the quark condensate due to the partial restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "it was shown that in the region of low momenta relevant for chiral symmetry breaking there is a strong screening effect of the gluon interactions , which suppresses the condensate @xcite . in this region ,",
    "the gluons acquire a mass @xmath0 of the order of @xmath1 , due to the coupling of the gluon field to a quark - antiquark interacting state . in the presence of a strong enough magnetic field ,",
    "this mass @xmath0 for gluons becomes larger .",
    "this , along with the property that the strong coupling @xmath2 decreases with increasing @xmath3 , @xmath4 with @xmath5 , @xcite leads to an effective weakening of the interaction between the quarks in the presence of an external magnetic field , and damps the chiral condensate .",
    "the suppression of the quark condensate , also known as inverse magnetic catalysis ( imc ) , manifests itself on the decrease of the pseudocritical chiral transition temperature obtained in lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations with physical quark masses and an increase of the polyakov field @xcite .",
    "recent results in two - flavor lqcd with dynamical overlap fermions in an external magnetic field also support the imc scenario @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it is argued that the imc may be a consequence of how the gluonic sector reacts to the presence of a magnetic field , and , it is shown that the magnetic field drives up the expectation value of the polyakov field .",
    "the distribution of gluon fields changes as a consequence of the distortion of the quark loops in the magnetic field background .",
    "therefore , the backreaction of the quarks on the gauge fields should be incorporated in effective models in order to describe the imc .",
    "almost all low - energy effective models , at zero chemical potential , including the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl)-type models , find an enhancement of the condensate due to the magnetic field , and no reduction of the pseudocritical chiral transition temperature with the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , a recent study using the polyakov  nambu  jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) @xcite has shown that if the lqcd data @xcite is fitted by making the pure - gauge critical temperature @xmath6 , a parameter of the pnjl model , @xmath3 dependent , the model is able to describe an imc . several recent studies @xcite discuss the origin of the imc phenomenon . in particular , the magnetic inhibition can be a possible explanation for the decreasing behavior of the chiral restoration temperature with increasing @xmath3 @xcite ; another mechanism to explain the imc around the critical temperature as induced by sphalerons was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the discussion above points out that the gluon distribution reacts to the magnetic background and suggests that the effective interaction between the quarks should get this dependence . with this motivation , we adopt a running coupling constant of the chiral invariant quartic quark interaction in njl and pnjl models with the magnetic field .",
    "the damping of the strength of the effective quartic interaction is built phenomenologically , keeping su(3 ) flavor symmetry , under different assumptions inspired by lattice results for the quark condensate at finite temperature and magnetic field .",

    "iii , the importance of the running coupling in the ( p)njl models for magnetized quark matter is discussed .",
    "also , the behavior of the condensates with temperature and the magnetic field intensity is compared with the lqcd results . finally , in sec .",

    "as already referred , the presence of an external magnetic field has two competing mechanisms : on one hand it enhances the chiral condensate due to the increase of low - energy contributions ; on the other hand there is a suppression of the condensate because in the region of the low momenta relevant for the chiral symmetry breaking mechanism there is a strong screening effect of the gluon interactions @xcite .",
    "this suppression of the condensate , also known as imc , manifests itself as the decrease of the pseudocritical chiral transition temperature obtained in lqcd calculations with physical quark masses @xcite and in the increasing of the polyakov loop @xcite .    within the njl and pnjl models",

    "<S> the qcd phase diagram at zero chemical potential and finite temperature subject to an external magnetic field is studied within the three - flavor nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model and the njl model with the polyakov loop . </S>",
    "<S> a scalar coupling parameter dependent on the magnetic field intensity is considered . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar coupling has been fitted so that the lattice qcd pseudocritical chiral transition temperatures are reproduced and in the limit of large magnetic field decreases with the inverse of the magnetic field intensity . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence of the coupling allows us to reproduce the lattice qcd results with respect to the quark condensates and polyakov loop : due to the magnetic field the quark condensates are enhanced at low and high temperatures and suppressed for temperatures close to the transition temperatures and the polyakov loop increases with the magnetic field . </S>"
