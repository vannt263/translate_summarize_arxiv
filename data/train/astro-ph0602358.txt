    "the central engines that power gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are thought to consist of a newly formed stellar mass black hole surrounded by a hot , dense , magnetized disk .",
    "the prompt and afterglow emissions are inferred to be produced in ultra - relativistic outflows that are launched by the central engine and accelerate to lorentz factors @xmath2 .",
    "the free energy source of those relativistic , gamma - ray emitting jets can be either the gravitational potential energy of accreted matter or the spin energy of a kerr black hole . whether due to dissipation of some fraction of the spin energy of the hole ( van putten & levinson 2003 ; levinson 2005 ) , or owing to hyper - accretion rates ( popham et al . 1999 ; pruet et al .",
    "2003 ) , the disk surrounding the black hole is expected to be sustained at mev temperatures , and its midplane density is expected to be high , in excess of @xmath3 gr @xmath4 . under such conditions the disk is optically thick to electromagnetic radiation and the dominant energy loss mechanism is neutrino emission .",
    "additionally , the nuclear composition in the inner parts of the disk is likely to be neutron rich ( beloborodov , 2003 ; pruet et al .",
    "2003 ) ; the neutron - to - proton ratio can in principle approach 30 if the disk material is cold enough ( @xmath5 mev ) and dense enough ( @xmath6 gr @xmath4 at the disk midplane ; see e.g. , fig . 1 in beloborodov [ 2003 ] ) .",
    "the prodigious neutrino luminosity is expected to drive a powerful wind from the disk .",
    "this wind is most likely baryon rich and expands at sub or mildly relativistic speeds except , perhaps , inside a core containing the putative baryon poor grb jet",
    ". the surrounding baryon rich wind may play an important role in the collimation of the central jet ( levinson & eichler , 2000 ; rosswog & ramirez - ruiz , 2003 ) , and its presence may also lead to some observational consequences ( e.g. , a supernova - like event ) .",
    "the nuclear composition of the disk outflow , particularly the central grb jet , is an issue of considerable interest .",
    "if , as often assumed , the grb jet picks up nuclei from the disk ( e.g. , derishev , kocharovsky & kocharovsky 1999 ; beloborodov 2003 ) then it may contain matter with a large neutron excess that is likely to affect its dynamics ( fuller et al .",
    "2000 ; vlahakis , peng & konigl 2003 ; rossi et al . 2005 ) , as well as some of the characteristics of the afterglow emission ( e.g. , derishev , kocharovsky & kocharovsky 1999 ; bachall & meszaros 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , the disk wind may be a potential site for nucleosynthesis ( pruet et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "the nuclear composition of the disk outflow should depend on the conditions at the disk surface and the details of mass ejection process , particularly on the ratio of outflow time and neutronization timescale .",
    "the gross features of the physical picture outlined above are supported by recent numerical simulations ( e.g. , proga et al .",
    "2003 ; mckinney , 2005a ; and references therein ) , however , the detailed structure and properties of the polar outflow are only marginally resolved .",
    "in particular , the origin of the fireball - whether emanates from the inner regions of the disk or produced via a bz mechanism , the nature of the baryon loading process , and the nuclear composition of the outflow are yet open issues . moreover , as will be shown below the mass ejection process is rather sensitive to the conditions at the flow injection point and the physical processes involved , which makes it difficult to study using global numerical simulations .    in order that a wind be accelerated hydrodynamically to high lorentz factors , the entropy per baryon at the wind injection region must be extremely high .",
    "purely hydrodynamic fireballs demand @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the terminal lorentz factor of the fireball and @xmath9 is the temperature at the base of the outflow .",
    "although the specific entropy of the fireball should rise as it accelerates , owing to absorption of neutrinos escaping from the dense layers of the disk , such extreme values are unlikely to be achieved .",
    "the requirements on the baryon loading can be alleviated if the outflow is magnetically dominated . in that case",
    ", the disk must support an ordered magnetic field with strength in excess of a few times @xmath10 g to account for the observed grb energies ( e.g. , levinson & eichler 1993 ; meszaros & rees , 1997 ) .",
    "such strong fields conceivably exist in the dense disks of hyperaccreting black holes ( e.g. , mckinney , 2005b ) . since the energy is extracted magnetically , acceleration of the outflow to high lorentz factors does not require , in principle , high specific entropy , but rather a high magnetic energy per baryon @xmath11 . in the ideal mhd case @xmath12 and",
    "if the fireball accelerates along magnetic field lines that are anchored to the disk , the question then arises as to how baryon overloading of magnetic field lines can be avoided .",
    "vlahakis , peng & konigl ( 2003 ) proposed that such high @xmath11 may not in fact be necessary if the ratio of baryon - to - magnetic flux is not conserved on magnetic flux surfaces .",
    "specifically , they considered a situation in which a neutron rich outflow , expelled along magnetic field lines that emanate from accreted disk material in the vicinity of the innermost stable circular orbit , is accelerated magnetically to a lorentz factor of order 10 , at which point the neutrons decouple .",
    "the remaining protons then continue to accelerate magnetically to @xmath13 . with",
    "n / p ratio of about 30 , @xmath14 or so is sufficient before decoupling ( but not smaller , otherwise the neutrons wo nt decouple at all ) .",
    "however , such a high n / p ratio requires optimal conditions in the disk , and essentially no evolution of the electron fraction @xmath15 during the acceleration phase prior to decoupling , which is questionable .",
    "the issue of mass loading has not been addressed in most of the previous work on magnetized , relativistic disk outflows .",
    "the common approach , following the pioneering work of blandford & payne ( 1982 ) , is to seek self - similar solutions of the trans - field equation ( li et al . , 1992 ; contopoulos 1994 ; vlahakis & konigle 2003 ) .",
    "while such a treatment considerably simplifies the analysis , it precludes the incorporation of gravity ( in the relativistic case ) as well as neutrino heating in the flow equations , and in addition does not allow matching of the self - similar outflow solution to a keplerian disk ( li et al .",
    "the immediate implication is that the self - similar outflow solutions can not be extended down to the sub - slow magnetosonic region . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass - to - magnetic flux ratio is determined by the regularity condition at the slow magnetosonic point , namely by the requirement that the outflow must pass smoothly through this point .",
    "this means that solutions of the flow equations in the sub - slow magnetosonic region must be obtained in order for the mass flux to be calculated . since the self - similar treatment is inapplicable in this region",
    ", one must seek a different approach . in this paper",
    "we construct a model for grmhd disk outflows with neutrino - driven mass ejection , and employ it to calculate the structure of the flow in the sub - slow region . using the regularity condition at the slow magnetosonic point we carefully examine how the mass flux depends on the conditions at the injection point , on geometry of magnetic surfaces , and on other wind quantities . in ",
    "2 we present the basic equations for a grmhd wind with external energy and momentum sources . in ",
    "3 we derive analytic expressions for the flow quantities in terms of the location and temperature at the slow point by employing the regularity condition , and identify some systematic trends . in ",
    "4 we present numerical solutions . our approach is to integrate the flow equations assuming the magnetic field geometry is given .",
    "since the slow point is located close to the disk midplane , our choice of a particular field geometry reflects in part a choice of boundary conditions .",
    "we explore a range of field geometries in order to elucidate the dependence of the mass flux on the shape of the field lines .",
    "neutrino - driven winds have been discussed previously in other contexts ( e.g. , duncan et al .",
    "1986 ; levinson & eichler 1993 ; woosley et al .",
    "1994 ; witti et al . 1994 ; qian & woosley 1996 ; thompson et al . 2001 ) . however , most previous models assume purely hydrodynamic , spherically symmetric winds , which are less relevant to the problem at hand .",
    "a simplified model of hydrodynamic disk outflow is presented in pruet et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , mainly in connection with nucleosynthesis .",
    "in this work we generalize those previous treatments to incorporate grmhd effects and disk geometries .",
    "we consider a mhd wind expelled from the surface of a hot , magnetized disk surrounding a non - rotating black hole . the range of conditions in the disk is envisioned to be similar to that computed by popham et .",
    "al . ( 1999 ) for hyperaccreting black holes with mass accretion rates @xmath16 @xmath17 s@xmath1 and viscosity parameters @xmath18 . under such conditions",
    "the total neutrino luminosity emitted from the disk lies in the range @xmath19 - @xmath20 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "we focus our attention on the inner regions of the disk ( within 10 schwarzschild radii or so ) where the midplane density exceeds about @xmath21 gr @xmath4 , and where the major fraction of the neutrino luminosity is generated .",
    "now , for the range of temperatures considered the torus material should be a mixture of baryons and a light fluid ( photons and electron - positron pairs in equilibrium ) .",
    "the light and baryonic fluids will be tightly coupled in the sub - slow magnetosonic region , owing to the large thomson depth . deep beneath its surface ,",
    "the torus is in a hydrostatic equilibrium where the vertical gravitational force exerted on it by the black hole is supported by the baryon pressure .",
    "in this region heating and cooling processes due to neutrino emission and absorption proceed at very high rates , and the temperature variation in the vertical direction is expected to be very small . as a consequence , the vertical density profile is roughly a gaussian with a rather small scale height ( @xmath22 ; see below ) . as the density drops , the ratio of light fluid pressure to baryonic pressure increases roughly as @xmath23 , until at @xmath24 gr @xmath4 the light fluid pressure dominates over the baryonic pressure ( see eq .",
    "[ [ sigma ] ] below ) . at this point hydrostatic equilibrium can no longer be sustained and the matter starts accelerating along magnetic field lines .",
    "this suggests that the mass flux carried by the wind should be controlled by the heating and cooling processes at the base of the wind .",
    "these processes are therefore incorporated into the flow equations derived below . to simplify the analysis we consider , in what follows , only time independent , axisymmetric models .",
    "as shown by vlahakis & konigle ( 2003b ) , a relativistic mhd pulse can be adequately described by the same equations .      since ,",
    "as explained above , the light and baryonic fluids will be tightly coupled at the base of the outflow , they can be treated as a single fluid .",
    "we denote by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , the proper baryon rest mass density , total pressure , total energy density , and dimensionless specific enthalpy of this mixed fluid .",
    "the stress - energy tensor then takes the form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the four - velocity measured in units of c , @xmath31 is the electromagnetic tensor , and @xmath32 is the metric tensor . in what follows",
    "we take spacetime to have a schwarzschild geometry , defined by the line element @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "we denote by @xmath36 the source terms associated with energy and momentum transfer by some external agent .",
    "the dynamics of the mhd system is then governed by the following set of equations : energy and momentum equations @xmath37 continuity equation @xmath38 and maxwell s equations , @xmath39 we assume the flow to be stationary and axisymmetric ( @xmath40 ) , and require infinite conductivity , @xmath41 .",
    "the above set of equations then admit two invariants : the mass - to - magnetic flux ratio @xmath42 and the angular velocity , @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the poloidal 4-velocity of the fluid defined by @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the corresponding 3-velocity , where @xmath47 is the lorentz factor , @xmath48 , @xmath49 is a rescaled poloidal magnetic field defined through @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the toroidal magnetic field . by contracting @xmath52 with eq .",

    "( 1990 ) to the non - adiabatic case .",
    "as seen , energy and momentum exchange with an external agent ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) formally modifies the conditions at the critical points .",
    "however , in practice we find this to be a small correction . as shown below , the main effect of heating is to enhance the temperature and the specific entropy at the slow point . in cases where the stream function is known , the above set of equations , augmented by an equation of state @xmath83 ,",
    "can be solved to yield the structure of the flow .",
    "the poloidal magnetic field can then be expressed in terms of the stream function .",

    "we invoke a spherical neutrino source with a radius @xmath103 cm and a total luminosity @xmath104 erg s@xmath1 , which are treated as free parameters .",
    "some fraction of the energy of the escaping neutrinos is deposited in the surface layers of the disk , via pair neutrino annihilation into electron - positron pairs and neutrino capture on neutrons and protons , thereby giving rise to a significant heating of the matter near the injection point of the wind .",
    "it is conceivable that turbulence or magnetic field dissipation may provide additional heating of the surface layers , but these processes are difficult to model and will be ignored .",
    "detailed account of the various neutrino heating and cooling process is given in qian & woosley ( 1996 ) .",
    "the heating rate due to neutrino absorption is approximately ( see also bethe and wilson 1985 ) @xmath105 and that due to neutrino - antineutrino annihilation into electron - positron pairs is ( e.g. , goodman et al .",

    "equating the last two rates one obtains the density below which the pair neutrino cooling rate exceeds the cooling rate due to electron and positron capture on nucleons , @xmath112 the critical density is found to be always well above this value , implying that urca cooling is the dominant energy loss mechanism in the regions of interest .",

    "the effective temperature @xmath246 lies in the range @xmath247 to @xmath248 mev for the range of neutrino luminosities discussed in popham et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "sample results and the parameters employed are summarized in figs 2 - 8 and in table 1 .",
    "typical solutions are shown in fig 2 , where the change along a field line of the flow quantities indicated is plotted against the normalized height above the disk midplane , @xmath249 , for the split monopole geometry with @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 g , @xmath253 , and @xmath254 , and for different values of the neutrino luminosity given in terms of @xmath246 .",
    "for each of the cases shown the temperature at the origin is @xmath255 since @xmath251 .",
    "as seen , the slow magnetosonic point is located rather close to the disk surface , at @xmath256 , as one might expect .",
    "well beneath the slow magnetosonic point the flow velocity is small , the density is high , and the specific entropy is dominated by the baryons , that is @xmath236 . in this region",
    "the net energy deposition rate nearly vanishes , viz .",
    ", @xmath257 , and the temperature profile is given to a good approximation by equation ( [ tprof ] ) .",
    "as the flow accelerates its temperature starts falling , and since the neutrino cooling rate is very sensitive to the temperature @xmath258 increases rapidly leading to a steep rise of the entropy per baryon to its terminal value , as seen in fig 2 .",
    "the reason why the energy deposition per unit length peaks well below the slow point , as seen , is that @xmath44 there is small and , hence , the time over which a fluid element is exposed to the external neutrino flux , @xmath259 , is large .",
    "although formally the total energy per baryon is not conserved along streamlines , we find that it changes only slightly ( to less than 0.1 % ) as the flow accelerates .",
    "this is because the net energy deposited per baryon comprises only a small fraction of the baryon rest mass .",
    "the main effect of neutrino heating is not to change the net outflow energy along streamlines , but rather to enhance the baryon load by increasing the light fluid pressure in layers of higher baryon density .",
    "thus , in practice the total energy per baryon can be considered conserved in the relativistic and mildly relativistic cases ( this may not be true if the wind is highly sub - relativistic ) , and so the value of @xmath198 presents , essentially , an upper limit for the asymptotic lorentz factor of the wind .",
    "the values of @xmath198 , @xmath197 and the mass flux , which we somewhat arbitrarily define as @xmath260 ( for a two - sided outflow ) , that corresponds to the cases depicted in fig .",
    "2 are listed in table 1 .",
    "the values of @xmath197 and @xmath198 computed numerically are in good agreement with analytic expressions given in eqs .",
    "( [ eta - crit ] ) and ( [ e - ant ] ) .    in fig .",
    "3 we plotted solutions obtained for a centrifugally driven outflow along field lines in the unstable regime ( @xmath261 ) .",
    "the effective disk surface in this example is located at @xmath262 .",
    "the temperature at the surface is @xmath263 mev , and the remaining parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "as seen , the slow magnetosonic point is located very near the surface .",
    "the correspoding mass fluxes are @xmath264 , @xmath265 , @xmath266 , and @xmath267 for @xmath268 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "in addition to this example , we also explored other regimes of the parameter space .",
    "the main conclusion is that , quite generally , the mass loading of centrifugally driven winds from neutrino cooled disks is too large to allow acceleration to relativistic speeds .",
    "since we are merely interested in relativistic winds here we focus , in what follows , on the regime @xmath269 .",
    "fig 4 exhibits the dependence of the total energy per baryon @xmath198 on the ratio @xmath270 .",
    "it is clearly seen that the magnetic energy per baryon , @xmath271 , depends linearly on @xmath270 , in agreement with the analytic expression given in eq .",
    "( [ e - ant ] ) . the ratio of mass - to - magnetic flux @xmath197 is found to be practically independent of @xmath270 . in the examples depicted in fig 4 , @xmath197 changes by less than 3% over the range @xmath272 .",
    "in fact we find that the mass flux @xmath273 is highly insensitive also to the strength of the poloidal field @xmath226 , provided the alfvn mach number @xmath66 is sufficiently small at the slow magnetosonic point ( that is , @xmath274 there ) , and that it depends predominantly on the neutrino flux , the geometry of magnetic field lines , and the angular velocity @xmath135 .",
    "this confirms that for a given choice of the latter parameters , @xmath11 is proportional to the product @xmath275 .",
    "the results presented in fig 4 can then be readily rescaled for other choices of @xmath226 .",
    "the dependence of baryon loading on the inclination angle of the field line is examined in fig 5 , where @xmath197 is plotted against the parameter @xmath276 for a fixed @xmath116 ( which corresponds to changing the distance @xmath200 in fig 1 keeping @xmath116 fixed ) .",
    "the corresponding mass flux , @xmath260 , is indicated on the right axis . as expected , the mass flux is larger on field lines with larger inclination angles , owing to the slingshot effect .",
    "the dependence of mass loading on the radius at which the field line intersects the disk is demonstrated in fig .",
    "6 , where @xmath197 and @xmath277 are plotted against @xmath116 for a fixed @xmath276 . as seen , the trend is that the mass flux increases with increasing @xmath116 .",
    "this mainly reflects the fact that the escape velocity is smaller on field lines that emanate from larger disk radii @xmath116 .",
    "however , the dependence is weaker than one might anticipate , owing to the decrease in the heating rate with increasing @xmath278 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ qnun ] ] and below ) .",
    "we also made some runs with different values of @xmath279 and found the mass flux to be sensitive also to this parameter at low @xmath246 .",
    "general relativistic effects appear to be important near the black hole , but we do not attempt here to quantify them .    for completeness , we also examined the dependence of @xmath197 on the angular velocity of magnetic flux tubes . although the latter is naively expected to be nearly keplerian , it is conceivable that various effects may give rise to non - keplerian rotation of some flux tubes during certain periods . the general trend , as seen in fig .",
    "7 , is for the baryon load to increase with increasing @xmath135 , by virtue of the larger contribution of centrifugal forces .",
    "however , a change in @xmath135 may also lead to a change in the poynting flux , so the implications for the asymptotic lorentz factor are not straightforward .",
    "fig 8 presents results obtained using the self - similar configuration with @xmath280 given by eq .",
    "( [ parabolic ] ) , for @xmath281 ( left panels ) and @xmath282 ( right panels ) .",
    "the behavior of the solutions is rather similar to the split monopole case .",
    "we generally find low mass fluxes for which @xmath283 on field lines that emanate from within several @xmath102 and that diverge not too fast at low enough neutrino temperatures ( @xmath284 mev ) .",
    "we have also checked other forms of @xmath280 . in all cases",
    "we find that at @xmath284 mev relativistic outflows can be launched from the innermost disk regions .",
    "we finally address the question whether the nuclear composition of the expelled matter changes during the acceleration of the flow .",
    "significant evolution of the electron fraction @xmath15 is expected if the neutronization timescale , @xmath285 s , is much shorter than the outflow time @xmath286 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath15 should take place at the base of the flow , where the temperature is highest and , hence , @xmath287 is shortest , and where @xmath44 is smallest and , hence , @xmath288 is longest . for most cases studied above",
    "we find the outflow time to be comparable to @xmath287 , and so the n / p ratio is expected to evolve during the initial acceleration phase .",
    "quantitative treatment of the nuclear processes in the wind is beyond the scope of this paper and is left for a future investigation .",
    "we have explored stationary , axisymmetric grmhd disk outflows in schwarzschild geometry with neutrino - driven mass ejection , under conditions anticipated in hyperacrreting black holes .",
    "we have examined the dependence of mass loading of the outflow on the neutrino luminosity emitted by the disk and on other wind quantities , for a range of effective neutrino temperatures @xmath289 mev , which for the simplified geometry of the neutrino emission zone invoked in our model corresponds to a neutrino luminosity range @xmath290 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "we find that up to a few percent of the neutrino luminosity produced inside the disk is deposited at the upper disk layers and used up to eject baryons along magnetic field lines .",
    "the neutrino - driven mass flux depends predominantly on the effective neutrino temperature at the base of the flow , on magnetic field geometry in the sub - slow magnetosonic region , and on the angular velocity of magnetic flux surfaces , but is highly insensitive to the strength of poloidal and toroidal magnetic field components near the surface provided the alfvn mach number is sufficiently small at the slow point ; the dependence on neutrino luminosity and the shape of magnetic field lines near the disk surface appears to be particularly sensitive .",
    "the heating of the wind by the escaping neutrinos results in a steep rise of the entropy per baryon , @xmath55 , during the initial acceleration phase , after which it saturates .",
    "the final value of @xmath55 is larger for lower @xmath291 , but does not seem to reach extreme values . for the range of conditions explored above it is typically below @xmath292 per baryon .",
    "our principle conclusion is that ejection of relativistic outflows from the innermost disk radii , within several @xmath102 or so , is possible in principle for certain magnetic field configurations even in non - rotating black holes , provided the neutrino luminosity is sufficiently low , and the magnetic field is sufficiently strong . in the case of the split monopole field delineated in section 4.1 , we obtain a mass flux of @xmath293 gr @xmath294 s@xmath1 on field lines in the vicinity of the innermost stable circular orbit that make an angle @xmath295 with the rotation axis , for a neutrino luminosity @xmath296 erg s@xmath1 ( corresponding to @xmath297 mev ) .",
    "the outflow along those field lines can , therefore , accelerate to lorentz factors @xmath298 if the magnetic field strength at the disk surface is @xmath299 g. the mass flux depends sensitively on both @xmath300 and @xmath246 , as can be seen from figure 5 and table 1 , and so a steep profile of the lorentz factor across the polar jet is naively expected .",
    "we find a similar trend also for the other field geometries adopted .",
    "thus , the picture often envisioned , of an ultra - relativistic core surrounded by a slower , baryon rich wind ( e.g. , levinson & eichler 1993 , 2000 ; ) seems a natural consequence of neutrino - assisted mhd disk outflows . at higher effective temperatures , @xmath301 mev or so",
    ", the baryon load is typically well in excess of the value inferred in grb fireballs , and the wind is expected to be slow .",
    "this conclusion may be altered if the central black hole is rapidly rotating .",
    "the hyperaccretion process is likely to be intermittent , leading to temporal changes in the neutrino luminosity .",
    "this should result in large variations of the lorentz factors of consecutive fluid shells expelled from the disk in the polar region , owing to the sensitive dependence of mass loading on @xmath291 .",
    "in this situation we expect strong shocks to form in the outflow .",
    "if the polar disk outflow is associated with the grb - producing jet , then the observed gamma - ray emission can be quite efficiently produced behind those shocks .",
    "it is worth noting that the conditions we find to be optimal for launching an ultrarelativistic jet in the polar region , are also the conditions favorable for large neutron - to - proton ratio in the disk .",
    "for example , by employing the results presented in table 2 of popham et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we estimate @xmath302 mev for accretion rates @xmath303 s@xmath1 into a 3 @xmath17 schwarzschild black hole . under such conditions",
    "a neutron - to - proton ratio larger than 10 is expected inside the disk within a few @xmath102 for viscosity parameters @xmath304 ( pruet et al .",
    "2003 ; see also beloborodoc 2003 ) .",
    "if turbulent mixing can quickly lift up neutron rich matter to the surface layers , then in can be picked up by the outflow .",
    "beloborodov ( 2003 ) has shown that deneutronization is not expected at temperatures below about @xmath305 mev if the mixing timescale is of the order of @xmath306 .",
    "however , because at low @xmath246 the flow time is comparable to the neutronization timescale , the electron fraction @xmath15 may evolve as the flow accelerates and the final nuclear composition of the outflow may somewhat change .",
    "further analysis is needed to determine the wind composition , but the trend seems to be that ultrarelativistic disk outflows can plausibly contain neutron rich matter .",
    "this is in accord with the conjecture often made , that fireballs pick up neutron rich material from the disk .",
