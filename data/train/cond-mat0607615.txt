    "the study of mean field spin glasses has been very challenging from both a physical and a mathematical point of view .",
    "it took several years after the main model ( the sherrington - kirkpatrick , or simply sk ) was introduced before giorgio parisi was able to compute the free energy so ingeniously ( @xcite and references therein ) , and it took much longer still until a fully rigorous proof of parisi s formula was found @xcite .",
    "parisi went beyond the solution for the free energy and gave an ansatz about the pure states of the model as well , prescribing the so - called ultrametric or hierarchical organization of the phases ( @xcite and references therein ) . from a rigorous point of view , the closest the community could get so far to ultrametricity are identities constraining the probability distribution of the _ overlaps _ , namely the aizenman - contucci ( ac ) and the ghirlanda - guerra identities ( see @xcite respectively ) . for further reading , we refer to @xcite , but also to the general references @xcite .",
    "most of the few important rigorous results about mean field spin glasses can be elegantly summarized within a powerful and physically profound approach introduced recently by aizenman et al . in @xcite .",
    "we want to show here that in this framework the ac identities can be deduced too .",
    "this is achieved by studying a stochastic stability of some kind , similarly to what is discussed in @xcite , inside the environment ( the _ random overlap structure _ ) suggested in @xcite , and taking into account also the intensive nature of the internal energy density .",
    "a central point of the treatment is a power series expansion similar to the one performed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the concept of random overlap structure ( henceforth rost ) , and use it to state the related extended variational principle . in section 3",
    "we present the main results regarding the ac identities and similar families of relations . in appendix",
    "a we emphasize that the same results are valid in any quasi - stationary rost , not just the boltzmann one .",
    "the hamiltonian of the sk model is defined on ising spin configurations @xmath0 of @xmath1 spins , labeled by @xmath2 , as @xmath3 where @xmath4 are i.i.d .",
    "centered unit gaussian random variables .",
    "we will assume there is no external field .",
    "being a centered gaussian variable , the hamiltonian is determined by its covariance @xmath5 = \\frac{1}{2}nq^2_{\\sigma\\sigma'}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the overlap , and @xmath7 denotes here the expectation with respect to all the ( quenched ) gaussian variables .",
    "the partition function @xmath8 , the quenched free energy density @xmath9 and pressure @xmath10 are defined as : @xmath11 the boltzmann - gibbs average of an observable @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath13 and defined as @xmath14 but we will use the same @xmath13 to indicate in general ( weighted ) sums over spins or non - quenched variables , to be specified when needed , and with @xmath15 we will mean the product ( _ replica _ ) measure of the needed number of copies of @xmath13 .",
    "let us now introduce an auxiliary system .",
    "a _ random overlap structure _ @xmath16 is a triple @xmath17 where    * @xmath18 is a discrete space ( set of abstract spin - configurations ) ; * @xmath19 $ ] is a positive definite kernel ( _ overlap kernel _ ) , with @xmath20 ( and @xmath21 on the diagonal of @xmath22 ) ; * @xmath23 is a normalized discrete positive random measure , i.e. a system of random weights such that there is a probability measure @xmath24 on @xmath25^{\\sigma}$ ] so that @xmath26 almost surely in the @xmath24-sense .",
    "the randomness in the weights @xmath27 is independent of the randomness of the quenched variables from the original system with spins @xmath28 .",
    "we equip a rost with two families of independent and centered gaussians @xmath29 and @xmath30 with covariances @xmath31&= & \\delta_{ij}\\tilde{q}_{\\gamma\\gamma^{\\prime}}\\ , \\\\",
    "\\label{hat } \\mathbb{e}[\\hat{h}(\\gamma)\\hat{h}(\\gamma^{\\prime})]&= & \\tilde{q}^2_{\\gamma\\gamma^{\\prime}}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] given a rost @xmath16 we define the trial pressure as @xmath32 where @xmath7 denotes hereafter the expectation with respect to all the ( quenched ) random variables ( including the randomness in the random weights @xmath27 ) but spins @xmath28 and the abstract spins @xmath33 , the sum over which is in fact written explicitly .",
    "the following theorem ( @xcite ) can be easily proven by interpolation    infimizing for each @xmath1 separately the trial function @xmath34 defined in ( [ trial ] ) over the whole rost space , the resulting sequence tends to the limiting pressure @xmath35 of the sk model as @xmath1 tends to infinity @xmath36    for a given rost , the trial pressures \\{@xmath37 } are a well defined sequence of real numbers indexed by @xmath1 ; a rost @xmath16 is said to be optimal if @xmath38 see @xcite for comments on some topological aspects of the rost theory .",
    "the space of all rost can be restricted to those rost s enjoying some factorization property that all optimal rost s enjoy , without missing the exact pressure @xcite .",
    "we will therefore limit ourselves to these rost s , called quasi - stationary .",
    "an optimal rost is the parisi one ( @xcite ) , another optimal one is the so - called boltzmann rost @xmath39 , defined as follows .",
    "take @xmath40 , and denote by @xmath41 the points of @xmath42 .",
    "we clearly have in mind an auxiliary spin systems ( and that is why we use @xmath41 as opposed to the previous @xmath33 to denote its points ) .",
    "in fact , we also choose @xmath43 which satisfy ( [ tilde])-([hat ] ) with @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are families of i.i.d .",
    "random variables independent of the original couplings @xmath47 , with whom they share the same distribution ( i.e. all the @xmath45 and @xmath46 are centered unit gaussian random variables ) .",
    "the variables @xmath48 are called _",
    "cavity fields_. let us also choose @xmath49    if we call @xmath50 the structure defined above , we will formally write @xmath51 as @xmath52 , and we call @xmath39 the boltzmann rost .",
    "the reason why such a rost is optimal is purely thermodynamic , and equivalent to the existence of the thermodynamic limit of the free energy per spin .",
    "a detailed proof of this fact can be found in @xcite ; here we just mention the main point : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the limit in the cesro sense .",
    "notice that the boltzmann rost does not depend on @xmath1 , after the @xmath55-limit .",
    "in this section we show that in the optimal boltzmann rost s the overlap fluctuations obey some restrictions , namely those found by aizenman and contucci in @xcite . in other words",
    "we exhibit a recipe to generate the ac polynomials within the rost approach .",
    "let us focus on the denominator of the trial pressure @xmath56 , defined in ( [ trial ] ) , computed at the boltzmann rost @xmath39 , defined in the previous section .",
    "let us normalize this quantity by dividing by @xmath57 and weight @xmath30 with an independent variable @xmath58 as opposed to @xmath59 , which appears in the _ boltzmannfaktor _ @xmath60 .",
    "as in the boltzmann structure we have actual spins ( @xmath41 ) and we do not use the spins @xmath28 here , we will still use @xmath13 ( or @xmath61 to denote the boltzmann - gibbs ( replica ) measure ( at inverse temperature @xmath59 ) in the space @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , we will use the notation @xmath62 and , if present , a subscript @xmath59 recalls that the _ boltzmannfaktor _ in @xmath15 has inverse temperature @xmath59 .",
    "more precisely , we are computing the left hand side of the next equality to get this    [ lisboa ] @xmath63    similar calculations have been performed already , but in this specific context the result has been only stated without proof in @xcite , while a detailed proof is given only in the dilute case in @xcite .",
    "so let us prove the lemma .",
    "let us take @xmath55 finite .",
    "thanks to the property of addition of independent gaussian variables , the left hand side of ( [ deng ] ) is the same as @xmath64 which in turn , thanks to the convexity of @xmath65 , can be estimated as follows @xmath66 now @xmath67 therefore , when @xmath52 , we get ( [ deng ] ) for almost all @xmath59 , i.e. whenever @xmath68 , or equivalently whenever @xmath69 . notice that the quantity in ( [ deng ] ) does not depend on @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "if we define @xmath82 then @xmath83 does not depend on @xmath1 @xcite , if we consider the infinite boltzmann rost , where @xmath52 .",
    "again , assume we replace the @xmath59 in front of the cavity fields @xmath48 ( but not in the state @xmath15 ) with a parameter @xmath84 , and define , upon rescaling , [ psi ] ( t)=__i=1^n_i_i  .",
    "we want to study the flux ( in @xmath85 ) of equation ( [ psi ] ) to obtain an integrable expansion .",

    "@xmath81    now the way to proceed is simple : we have to expand the @xmath85-derivative of @xmath99 ( right hand side of ( [ stream ] ) ) using the cavity streaming equation ( [ simmetria ] ) , and we will stop the iteration at the first non trivial order ( that is expected to be at least four , being the first ac relation of that order ) . once a closed - form expression is in our hands , we can write down an order by order expansion of the ( modified ) denominator of the boltzmann rost ( that is the function @xmath100 evaluated for @xmath101 )",
    ". we have @xmath102 after the first iteration : @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 the higher orders can be obtained exactly in the same way , so we can write down right away the expression for @xmath106 , referring to @xcite for a detailed explanation of this iterative method : @xmath107 notice that the averages no longer depend on @xmath85 . in this expansion we considered both @xmath108-overlaps and @xmath109-overlaps , but as the sum over the spins @xmath28 can be performed explicitly",
    ", we can obtain an explicit expression at least for the @xmath108-overlaps , and get @xmath110 moreover , as the @xmath108-overlaps have been calculated explicitly , we can use a graphical formalism @xcite . in such a formalism we use points to identify replicas and lines for the overlaps between them .",
    "so for example : @xmath111 and so on . now we can integrate ( [ stream ] ) thanks to the polynomial expansion based on ( [ expansion ] ) and to the expressions for the @xmath108-fluctuations .",
    "we obtain @xmath112dt^{\\prime}\\ , \\ ] ] @xmath113\\ .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] this expression , though truncated at this low order , already looks pretty much alike the expansion found using the internal energy part of the boltzmann pressure .",
    "we stress however two important features of expression ( [ main ] ) .",
    "the first is that within this approach we do not have problems concerning the replica simmetry anzatz ( rs ) @xcite , and this can be seen by the proliferating of the overalaps fluctuations , via which we expand the entropy ( a rs theory does not allow such fluctuations ) .",
    "secondly , we note that not all the terms inside the equations ( [ main ] ) are intensive : the last three graphs are all multiplied by a factor @xmath1 .",
    "recalling that this expansion does not depend on @xmath1 , and physically a density is intensive by definition , we put to zero all the terms in the squared bracket , so to have @xmath114 again we can find the ac identities .",
    "for sake of simplicity , all the explicit calculation we performed took into account the boltmann structure only .",
    "but the whole content actually does not depend on the explicit form of the hamiltonians , it merely relies on the gaussian nature of the random variables and their moments , independently of the space they are defined in . in other words , as long as we consider centered gaussian variables , the whole treatment depends only on their covariances .",
    "that is why changing the rost does not change the results , except the overlaps in the various expressions will be those of the considered rost ( e.g. the ultrametric parisi trial overlaps ) , provided some properties are preserved ( quasi - stationarity ) .",
    "let us focus for instance on the internal energy part , which is simpler , and see that the results of subsection [ internal ] are the same in any quasi - stationary rost .",
    "first of all , notice that the proof of theorem [ acinternal ] never makes use of the explicit form of the hamiltonians and therefore ( [ contr1])-([contr2])-([contr3 ] ) stay identical , as they are determined purely by the covariances of the hamiltonians . the same clearly holds for all the other terms not explicitly considered in the example .",
    "so the validity of the results coincides with the validity of lemma [ lisboa ] .",
    "the rost s for which such a lemma holds are called quasi - stationary ( see @xcite ) , in this case with respect to the cavity step ( see @xcite ) .",
    "notice that the left hand side of ( [ deng ] ) is zero for @xmath115 independently of the particular rost .",
    "hence by the fundamental theorem of calculus the same left hand side coincides with the integral from zero to @xmath58 of its derivative ( with respect to @xmath58 ) .",
    "but the form of such a derivative is just determined by the covariance of @xmath30 ( this is at the heart of @xcite ) , which is always defined to be an overlap . therefore a simple gaussian integration by parts , as illustrated in @xcite , leads to the right hand side of ( [ deng ] ) .",
    "these are the intuitive reasons that heuristically explain why both the explicit calculation in lemma [ lisboa ] and the expansion of theorem [ acinternal ] are the same in any quasi - stationary rost , and so are the ac polynomials , no matter what the overlap looks like in a generic abstract space .",
    "so ac polynomials hold in any quasi - stationary rost , non - optimal too , but if the chosen rost is not optimal there will be no overlap locking and the trial overlap will have very little to share with the true ones of the model .",
    "moreover ( [ deng ] ) will not in general provide the internal energy of the model ( but this can be the case in some optimal rost too , like the parisi one ! ) .",
    "we have shown how some constraints on the distribution of the overlap naturally arise within the random overlap structure approach .",
    "as our analysis of the boltzmann rost is similar to the study of stochastic stability it is not surprising that the constraints coincide with the aizenman - contucci identities . in the rost context",
    ", such identities are easily connected with the existence of the thermodynamic limit of the free energy density ( which is equivalent to the optimality of the boltzmann rost ) and with the physical fact that the internal energy is intensive .",
    "we also showed that , as expected , the entropy part of the free energy yields the same constraints as the other part ( i.e. the internal energy ) .",
    "the hope for the near future is that the rost approach will lead eventually to a good understanding of the pure states and the phase transitions of the model .",
    "a first step has been taken in @xcite , and our present results can be considered as a second step in this direction .",
    "( other more interesting results regarding the phase transition at @xmath116 can also be obtained with the same techniques employed here , including the graphical representation @xcite . )",
    "a further step should bring the ghirlanda - guerra identities , and then hopefully a proof of ultrametricity .",
    "the authors warmly thank francesco guerra and pierluigi contucci for a precious scientific and personal support , and sincerely thank peter sollich for useful discussions and much advice .",
    "a grateful appreciation is owed to louis - pierre arguin for pointing out a weak point in a previous version of the paper and for very fruitful conversations ."
