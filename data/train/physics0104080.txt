    "the most fundamental event in the history of life was probably the appearance via spontaneous creation of a molecule capable of replicating itself ( replicator ) . given a possible mechanism of replication , which in this case is some form of template activity , the evolution of such replicators has been extensively investigated through the chemical kinetics formalism put forward by eigen and co - workers in the seventies @xcite .",
    "those studies have raised a series of objections to the simplistic view of the emergence of a complex organism from a collection of competing species of replicators .",
    "for instance , the finding that the length of a molecule ( polynucleotide ) is limited due to the finite replication accuracy per nucleotide has prompted the proposal of models that incorporated some sort of cooperation between the replicators , such as the molecular catalytic feedback networks termed hypercycles @xcite .",
    "these models , however , have attracted their own criticisms since , as pointed out by maynard smith , giving catalytic support in such molecular networks is in fact an altruistic behavior and so they are extremely vulnerable to the presence of parasites , i.e. , molecules that do not reciprocate the catalytic support they receive @xcite . a possible solution to this problem",
    "is provided by the structured deme formulation of group selection @xcite , where it is assumed that the replicators are spatially localized , say , in rock crevices or water droplets , so that the benefits accrued from cooperation are directed mostly to the members of the catalytic network @xcite .",
    "yet another successful approach to the problem of resistance against parasites is based on a reaction - diffusion system where replication and diffusion taking place on an adsorbing surface generate self - organized spiral structures @xcite .",
    "interestingly , as these spatial structures , which greatly increase the stability of the hypercycles against parasites , can be viewed as super - organisms that approach is also related to the group selection theory @xcite .    since in the prebiotic or chemical evolution context ,",
    "natural selection is essentially the dynamics of replicators , it is not surprising that most of the studies in this subject have focused almost exclusively on the competition between replicators , among which the so - called malthusian and hypercyclic replicators are the most important @xcite .",
    "the former corresponds to the simplest reproduction process , namely , the binary fission of a parent replicator and is modelled by the chemical reaction @xmath9 where @xmath0 is the replicator and @xmath5 is the source materials ( mononucleotide resources ) .",
    "it is well - known that the concentration of @xmath0 grows exponentially with the rate constant @xmath2 , provided that the concentration of @xmath5 is kept constant , hence the name malthusian replicator . to avoid this explosive growth ,",
    "one usually imposes a constraint on the total concentration of replicators which can be implemented in practice by a dilution flux @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can allow the replicators to be degraded by hydrolysis into its mononucleotide components @xmath5 according to the reaction @xmath10 which seems a more natural approach to limit the growth of @xmath0 .",
    "as best exemplified by sexual reproduction , there are situations that can not be described by ( [ reac_malt ] ) since two replicators are necessary to produce a third one . in this case",
    "the corresponding chemical reaction is @xmath11 which leads to a hyperbolic growth of the concentration of replicator @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a hypercyclic replicator is defined as one that can replicate itself using both ( [ reac_malt ] ) and ( [ reac_hyper ] ) reaction schemes .",
    "actually , the term hypercycle derives from the superimposition of the catalytic replication cycle ( [ reac_hyper ] ) on the self - replication cycle ( [ reac_malt ] ) .",
    "of course , the limit @xmath12 corresponds to the malthusian replicator while @xmath13 can be associated to an obligatory sexual replicator .",
    "in contrast to previous works that have concentrated on the competition between replicators either of the same kind but with different production rates @xcite or of different kinds @xcite , in this paper we address a more fundamental problem that has received comparatively little attention , namely , the stability of the different kinds of replicators , viewed here as an active ( ordered ) phase of the molecular system , against the empty ( disordered ) phase composed of the resource materials only .",
    "this lack of interest was probably due to the fact that the usual kinetics formalism used to study the dynamics of replicators does not represent the mononucleotide resource dynamics explicitly ( see however @xcite ) , thus precluding the study of the issues addressed in the present contribution .",
    "more pointedly , we consider the dynamics of a population of identical hypercyclic replicators on a lattice space both in the deterministic infinite diffusion ( mean - field ) limit and in the stochastic position - fixed ( contact process ) limit where each replicator on a lattice cell never moves .",
    "the last limit is particularly interesting because it allows the connection between the replicator models and some standard models of nonequilibrium phase transition in a lattice ( e.g. directed percolation ) @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the powerful analytical tools of statistical mechanics can be readily used to advance our understanding of the evolution of replicators .",
    "of particular relevance is the so - called dynamic monte carlo method whose idea is to set the system initially in the empty state with a seed of replicators in the center of the lattice and then study the subsequent spreading of activity @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the thorough analysis of both limits exposes the limitations of the widely used deterministic chemical kinetics or mean - field formalism to study the problem of the emergence of life .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : level2 ] we present the set of rules that govern the evolution of a population of hypercyclic replicators in a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "the mean - field or infinite diffusion limit , which models an ideally mixed medium , is studied analytically in sec .",
    "[ sec : level3 ] .",
    "the results are summarized in a phase diagram showing the regions of stability of the empty and active regimes in the space of the control parameters of the model .",
    "those regions are delimitated by continuous as well as discontinuous transition lines that join at a tricritical point . in sec .",
    "[ sec : level4 ] we study the position - fixed or contact process limit using mainly the dynamic monte carlo method which allows the computation of the critical dynamic exponents that describe quantitatively the spreading of a vanishingly small population of replicators . finally , some concluding remarks are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : level5 ] .",
    "in particular , we compare the hypercyclic replicator model with schlgl s models of nonequilibrium phase transition in reaction - diffusion systems @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that chemical evolution started with a surface - bonded autocatalytic chemical network as there are enormous thermodynamics and kinetics advantages of surface binding reactions , especially in the case of reactions that require unlikely collisions of many reactants @xcite .",
    "the binding must be strong enough to keep the reactants on the surface but also flexible enough to allow their slow migration on it .",
    "interestingly , if this proposal proves correct it will probably lead to the replacement of the popular notion of a primitive soup by that of a primitive pizza instead @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we define our replicator model in a two - dimensional space consisting of @xmath14 cells in a square toroidal lattice .",
    "each cell is either empty or occupied by a replicator and it is assumed that an empty cell contains all source material required to assemble a new replicator .",
    "the evolution of the population of replicators is governed by the following local rules :    * a replicator has a probability @xmath6 of decaying ; after decay the cell becomes empty .",
    "this rule is motivated by the hydrolysis reaction ( [ reac_decay ] ) .",
    "* a replicator in one of the four first neighbor cells ( von neumann neighborhood ) of an empty cell can replicate into that cell with probability @xmath2 .",
    "this process is referred to as non - catalised self - replication and is motivated by the reaction ( [ reac_malt ] ) .",
    "* regardless of the previous rule , a replicator in the von neumann neighborhood of an empty cell can replicate into that cell if there are other replicators in the intersection of the moore neighborhoods of both cells .",
    "the probability of this type of replication , which is motivated by reaction ( [ reac_hyper ] ) , is @xmath4 for each pair of replicators .",
    "we recall that the moore neighborhod of a given cell consists of its first and second nearest neighbors , adding up to eight cells .",
    "hence in the extreme situation where an empty cell is surrounded by eight replicators , it can become occupied with probability @xmath15 . to carry out the simulations we choose the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath2 such that @xmath16 .",
    "these rules are applied simultaneously to all cells in the lattice so our model can be viewed as a two - dimensional stochastic cellular automaton .",
    "actually the model is essentially an adaptation to one - membered hypercycles of the spatial cellular automaton model of multi - membered hypercycles proposed by boerlijst and hogeweg @xcite .",
    "the dynamics defined by the rules given above is manifestly irreversible and , in particular , the state characterized by empty cells only is an absorbing state , i.e. , a configuration from which the system can not escape . in this sense ,",
    "the principle of detailed balance is broken and the active stationary state is in fact in nonequilibrium . although the more realistic situation is a diffusion - controled reaction where each reactant can move randomly on the lattice , in this paper we choose to study in detail the simpler extreme cases of infinite diffusion ( mean field ) and no diffusion ( contact process ) .",
    "of course , we hope that features common to both limits will be present in the finite diffusion situation as well .",
    "the mean - field limit describes exactly an infinite population of reactants in an ideally mixed medium and so it is equivalent to the usual chemical kinetics formulation . neglecting spatial correlations among cells , i.e. , assuming that at any time the molecules are distributed randomly over the lattice cells , it is straightforward to write the evolution equation for the density of replicators or occupied cells at time @xmath17 , namely , @xmath18 we will consider only the stationary solutions @xmath19 of this equation .",
    "the absorbing ( empty ) state @xmath20 is always a solution , while the non - zero solutions are given by the roots of the quadratic equation @xmath21 where we have introduced the dimensionless parameters @xmath22 this equation has real roots provided that the condition @xmath23 is satisfied .",
    "in addition we can easily show that : ( i ) for @xmath24 and @xmath25 both roots are positive ; ( ii ) for @xmath24 and @xmath26 both roots are negative ; and ( iii ) for @xmath27 only one of the roots is negative .",
    "furthermore , though the solution @xmath28 exists in the entire plane @xmath29 , it is stable only if the condition @xmath30 which reduces to @xmath31 , is satisfied . in the region",
    "where the non - zero roots are physical ( i.e. , real and positive ) , the stable root is always the largest one . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_mf ] we show the steady - state density of replicators for two different choices of initial density .",
    "we identify three distinct phases : the absorbing or empty phase @xmath32 associated to the solution @xmath20 ; the replicating or active phase @xmath33 associated to the solution @xmath34 ; and the phase labeled @xmath35 where both solutions @xmath20 and @xmath34 are stable . in this phase ,",
    "the outcome of the dynamics is not determined by the control parameters only but also by the initial abundance of replicators .",
    "> from this figure it is clear that the system undergoes a continuous non - equilibrium phase transition from phase @xmath32 to phase @xmath33 at @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "explicitly , near this transition the density of replicators can be written as @xmath38 the continuous transition ends at the tricritical point @xmath39 so that for @xmath40 the transition between phases @xmath32 and @xmath35 , that takes place at @xmath41 , as well as the transition between phases @xmath35 and @xmath33 , that occurs at @xmath42 , are discontinuous .",
    "in particular , the jumps of the densities of replicators are @xmath43 at the transition @xmath44 , and @xmath45 at the transition @xmath46 .",
    "these results are conveniently summarized in the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag_mf ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that setting @xmath47 we find , close to the tricritical point , @xmath48 so that the tricritical point is not in the same universality class as the transition observed in the absence of catalytically assisted replication .",
    "the interpretation of our results within the prebiotic evolution context leads to the conclusion that for finite values of @xmath49 an obligatory sexual replicator can not emerge spontaneously ( i.e. , appear at vanishingly small concentrations ) .",
    "for instance , for @xmath50 , the minimal initial density of replicators necessary to engender a prosperous population is @xmath51 at the transition point @xmath52 , vanishing as @xmath53 for large @xmath49 .",
    "actually , an initial colony of replicators is certain to grow from vanishingly small concentrations provided that @xmath54 .",
    "these conclusions , however , must be taken with caution since in the deterministic limit a vanishingly small concentration means an infinite population of replicators , while one would expect the first replicators to show up as a single or a few copies at most .",
    "of course , a proper understanding of this emergence phenomenon calls for a stochastic approach , which is the subject of the next section .",
    "the primary aim of this section is to determine what features of the rich phase - diagram obtained in the mean - field limit show up also in the opposite limit , where the replicators are fixed on the lattice cells .",
    "this is a rather challenging enterprise as , at least in the case of equilibrium phase - transitions , there is no totally unambiguous way by which one can detect the order of the transition through the analysis of finite systems alone @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we tackle this problem using both a steady - state approach for finite lattices and the dynamical monte carlo method for lattices of effectively infinite size .",
    "first we measure de density @xmath55 of replicators in the steady state .",
    "our results for two system sizes ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : rho ] and [ fig : log_rho ] . for each set of the control parameters we made runs of @xmath58 generations , neglecting the first @xmath59 generations and recording @xmath55 at steps of @xmath60 generations .",
    "a generation corresponds to the simultaneous update of all lattice cells .",
    "each data point is the arithmetic mean of these recorded data .",
    "provided that the population is not extinct , the results are independent of the choice of the initial configuration . in particular , we have made runs starting from all cells occupied or from a seed of only four clustered occupied cells .",
    "furthermore , as in the mean - field limit we have verified that our results depend only on the ratios @xmath8 and @xmath7 so throughout the remaining of this paper the value of the decay constant is held fixed at @xmath61 .",
    "these results clearly indicate the existence of a phase transition separating the active ( @xmath34 ) and empty ( @xmath28 ) phases of the model . assuming that in the neighborhood of the transition points the density of replicators goes to zero as @xmath62 and using the least - square method we can estimate both the critical replication rate @xmath63 and the critical exponent @xmath64 .",
    "these estimates are presented in table [ tab : steady ] and the quality of the fitting can be appreciated from fig .",
    "[ fig : log_rho ] .",
    "the statistical errors are of order of @xmath65 but the systematic errors , which are due mainly to the difficulty to carry out long runs very close to the transition point , are probably much larger .",
    "we note that our estimates of @xmath66 for small values of @xmath49 indicate that in this regime the replicator model belongs to the so - called @xmath67 directed - percolation universality class for which @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that in finite systems the active regime is a meta - stable one as there is always a finite probability that the colony becomes extinct due to fluctuations in the stochastic dynamics . since this",
    "extinction probability increases towards @xmath69 as the critical point is approached , it is very difficult to obtain reliable estimates of @xmath63 and @xmath66 by means of numerical simulations in the steady - state regime .",
    "of course we are aware that if the transition happens to become discontinuous at some value of @xmath70 then the assumption of a power - law singularity at the transition point breaks down ( actually @xmath71 in this case ) .",
    "in fact , the ( anomalous ) continuous decrease of @xmath66 as @xmath49 increases ( see table [ tab : steady ] ) is an indication that this might be the case .",
    "our careless use of the power - law assumption is intentional and aims to illustrate the difficulty of detecting the order of a phase transition using results of steady - state simulations : the abrupt variation of @xmath55 at criticality observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] for certain values of @xmath49 , which might indicate the occurrence of a first - order irreversible transition , can be explained as a continuous transition with a small exponent @xmath66 as well .",
    ".estimates of the critical point @xmath63 and the critical exponent @xmath66 assuming the power - law singularity @xmath72 . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we turn now to the analysis of the spreading behavior of a small colony of replicators settled initially in the center of an otherwise empty lattice of infinite size .",
    "more pointedly , the initial colony is composed of four replicators located in the von neumann neighborhod of the central empty cell .",
    "finite size effects are absent because the lattice size is taken large enough so that during the time we follow the evolution of the colony the replicators can never reach the lattice boundaries .",
    "this of course sets an upper limit to the number of generations we can follow the colony and so , in particular , we let the population evolve up to typically @xmath73 . as usual , we concentrate on the time dependence of the following key quantities @xcite : ( i ) the average number of replicators @xmath74 ; ( ii ) the survival probability of the colony @xmath75 ; and ( iii ) the average mean - square distance over which the replicators have spread @xmath76 . for each time",
    "@xmath17 we carry out @xmath77 independent runs , all starting with the same initial colony .",
    "hence @xmath75 is simply the fraction of runs for which there is at least one replicator in the lattice at time @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath74 is an average taken over all runs including those which have already been extinct at generation @xmath17 , the average number of replicators per surviving run is given by the ratio @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , noting that @xmath76 is averaged only over the surviving runs , we can define the fractal dimension @xmath79 of the surviving colonies of replicators at a given time @xmath17 as @xmath80 .    at the transition",
    "points we expect that the measured quantities obey the following scaling laws @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are dynamic exponents which are related with the fractal dimension of the clusters of replicators through the equation @xmath85 in principle , these scaling laws are valid for continuous as well as discontinuous phase transitions , though the scaling relations between the exponents , such as the ` hyperscaling ' relation @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the lattice dimension , hold only in the case of continuous transitions .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : logn_s ] and [ fig : logp_s ] we present log - log plots of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , as functions of @xmath17 in the vicinity of the critical point for @xmath88 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath17 is not shown since , near criticality , the curves for different values of @xmath89 are clustered together and do not reveal any qualitatively relevant information on the colony evolution .",
    "the asymptotic straight lines observed in these figures are the signature of critical behavior while upward and downward deviations indicate supercritical and subcritical behaviors , respectively . a precise estimate for the critical exponents",
    "is obtained by considering the local slopes of the curves shown in the previous figures .",
    "for instance , the local slope @xmath90 is defined by @xcite @xmath91}{\\ln 5 } , \\ ] ] which for large @xmath17 behaves as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a constant .",
    "analogous expressions hold for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "hence plots of the local slopes as functions of @xmath96 allow the calculation of the critical exponents . using this procedure",
    "we find @xmath97 which yields the exponents @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the error in @xmath63 is estimated by determining two values of @xmath89 as close as possible to the critical point for which upward and downward deviations can be observed , while the errors in the critical exponents are , as usual , the statistical errors obtained by fitting the local slopes by straigh lines in the large @xmath17 regime .",
    "our exponents are in good agreement with those of the @xmath67 directed - percolation @xcite and satisfy very well the hyperscaling relation ( [ hyperscaling ] ) thus indicating that the transition in the limit @xmath88 is continuous , as expected .",
    "the results of the spreading analysis for the other extreme case , @xmath50 , which models a population of obligatory sexual replicators are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : logn_c ] and [ fig : logp_c ] .",
    "although the dependence of @xmath101 on @xmath17 is similar to that observed in the previous case , the behavior pattern of @xmath102 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : logn_c ] ) is rather different : in the supercritical regime ( i.e. , @xmath103 ) @xmath74 first increases reaching a maximum , then decreases reaching a minimum and finally starts to increase monotonically again .",
    "this pattern is illustrated better in fig .",
    "[ fig : logn_0.05 ] , which shows the spreading results for @xmath104 .",
    "analysis of these figures , which exceptionally show the colony evolution up to @xmath105 generations , suggests that a flat line separates the supercritical and the subcritical regimes implying thus the vanishing of the exponent @xmath83 at the transition point .",
    "furthermore , the qualitatively distinct behavior patterns of @xmath102 illustrated in figs . [ fig : logn_s ] , [ fig : logn_c ] and [ fig : logn_0.05 ] can be used to identify unambiguously the order of the nonequilibrium phase transition and hence to estimate the location of the tricritical point . to appreciate how the time dependence of @xmath102 in the supercritical regime changes continuously from the simple monotonic increase for @xmath50 to the complicated behavior described above for @xmath88 we present in figs .

    "in fact , analysis of figs .",
    "[ fig : logn_c ] to [ fig : logn_0.25 ] suggests that the turning point between those distinct behavior patterns occurs when the maximum and the minimum of @xmath74 coincide , i.e. , the critical curve @xmath102 vs. @xmath108 has an inflection point ( see fig . [",
    "fig : logn_0.15 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath89 and the corresponding @xmath109 at which this behavior occurs are then identified as the coordinates of the tricritical point . applying this procedure we find @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",

    "the errors in the estimates of the transition points are calculated as described before for the case @xmath88 . except for that case ,",
    "we refrain from presenting the ( statistical ) errors in the exponents since the systematic errors are unusually large , due probably to the crossover behavior among ( at least ) three different universality classes . for instance , in the vicinity of the transition point for @xmath112 , analysis of the local slope @xmath113 up to @xmath114 indicates a clear tendency to the asymptotic value @xmath115 while for @xmath116 the tendency suddenly changes towards the asymptotic value @xmath117 .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs for @xmath107 also : the initial tendency is towards @xmath117 and then changes towards @xmath118 for larger times . as a result",
    "the estimate of the exponents becomes strongly dependent on the precise location of the transition points , which requires even better statistics as well as much longer runs .",

    "this result contrasts to our findings in the mean - field limit that the fixed point associated to the empty phase becomes unstable for @xmath54 so that even starting with a vanishingly small concentration of replicators the population never dies out . as mentioned before , the reason for this discrepancy is not the difference in mobility of the replicators but the fact that the mean - field analysis actually considers an infinite population and hence it fails to take into account the stochastic fluctuations that could drive a small population to extinction .    for sake of completeness , we should mention that we have also carried out a similar analysis for one - dimensional lattices ( chains ) .",

    "furthermore , motivated by the modern theories for the evolution of life that suggest a scenario of diffusion - controlled chemical reactions taking place on adsorbing surfaces ( probably pyrite ) where each reactant can move randomly on the surface @xcite , we have considered a two - dimensional lattice model where each reactant can occupy one of the lattice cells .    since the diffusion process of reactants complicates considerably the analysis , we have focussed on the two extreme situations : the infinite diffusion or mean - field limit and the position - fixed or contact process limit .",
    "the expectation is that features common to both limits should also be present in the more realistic , intermediate situations . in both cases we found rich phase diagrams showing the regions in the plane @xmath133 where the replicators persist ( active phase ) and",
    "die out ( empty phase ) : these regions are separated by second - order nonequilibrium phase transitions which turn into first - order ones at tricritical points .",
    "the dynamic monte carlo method has proven very well suited to our investigation of the position - fixed limit not only because the method is based on the analysis of the spreading behavior of a small colony of active cells , which is exactly the problem we are interested in , but because , rather surprisingly , it allows an unambiguous identification of the order of the nonequilibrium phase transition .",
    "in addition , we show that the continuous transition is in the universality class of the @xmath67 directed percolation .    some remarks on the apparent similarity between schlgl s first and second models and the replicator models studied in this paper are in order @xcite .",
    "in fact , irreversible versions of schlgl s first and second models are recovered when the reactant @xmath5 is eliminated from reactions ( [ reac_malt ] ) and ( [ reac_hyper ] ) , respectively , so that the existence of an empty cell containing source materials is not required for replication .",
    "interestingly , this difference is not important in the case of malthusian replicators ( @xmath12 ) since this model has the same critical behavior as schlgl s first model , namely , a second - order phase transition which is in the same universality class of the @xmath134 directed percolation ( the mean - field limit is obtained for @xmath135 ) @xcite .",
    "the comparison between schlgl s second model and obligatory sexual replicators ( @xmath13 ) is more involved . on the one hand ,",
    "the mean - field analysis of schlgl s second model predicts a first - order phase transition @xcite but monte carlo calculations indicate that the transition for @xmath136 is a second - order one which is actually in the same universality class as the transition in schlgl s first model @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", our results for the case @xmath13 show that a directed - percolation - like , second - order phase transition takes place for @xmath137 only , the transition being discontinuous for higher dimensions ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "we should mention , however , that the monte carlo implementation of schlgl s second model actually allows the diffusion of reactants to neighboring cells and , in addition , allows a cell to shelter more than one reactant @xcite so that a comparison with the position - fixed limit may not be appropriate . in any event",
    ", it is our opinion that the hypercyclic replicator model should not be viewed as a mere variant of schlgl s models ; rather it is a well - established model of chemical evolution @xcite which , as far as we know , has not been studied beyond the mean - field limit .",
    "although the simple replicator model considered in this paper turned out to be a quite exciting model of nonequilibrium phase transitions , we should not lose sight of the original purpose of this work and so , at this stage , it is important to highlight the relevance of our results to the origin of life issue .",
    "in fact , the mere existence of a phase transition between the empty and the active regimes poses a difficulty to our scenario of the emergence of life since the scaled production rate @xmath89 of the spontaneously created self - replicating molecule must be larger than some threshold value already at the outset . though increasing the mobility of the reactants decreases this threshold somewhat , that scenario would be more plausible if replicators with vanishingly small production rates could also thrive .",
    "the situation becomes even worse in the case of first - order transitions : in the deterministic mean - field limit the initial abundance of the spontaneously created replicators should be large as well , while in the stochastic position - fixed limit the probability of survival in the vicinity of the transition point is some orders of magnitude smaller than in the case of a second - order transition ( see figs . [",
    "fig : logp_s ] and [ fig : logp_c ] ) .",
    "furthermore , our results indicate that some important conclusions , such as the certainty of survival for @xmath54 or the role played by the initial concentration of replicators near a discontinuous transition , are actually artifacts of the deterministic formalism commonly used to study chemical evolution .    in summary ,",
    "our results show the necessity of adding some new elements to the standard scenario for the emergence of life whose effect would be to avoid the phase - transitions , allowing thus inefficient replicators to thrive at this first stage of life .",
    "only then one can invoke natural selection and imperfect replication to boost the replication rates .",
    "in addition , our results point to the inadequacy of the deterministic mean - field or chemical kinetics formulation to address the origin of life issue and suggest as an alternative stochastic formulation the dynamic monte carlo method that has been extensively used in the physics literature to study nonequilibrium phase transitions .    the work of j.f.f . is supported in part by conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico ( cnpq ) and fundao de amparo  pesquisa do estado de so paulo ( fapesp ) , proj .",
