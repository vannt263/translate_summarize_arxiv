    "in the last decade magnetic multilayer systems and the giant magnetoresistance resulting from interlayer couplings have been receiving considerable interest in both applied and fundamental scientific research .",

    "the most complete theory unifying all previous approaches has been devised by bruno @xcite .",
    "however , neither interlayer coupling in systems composed of two _ nonmetallic _ materials , nor mechanisms that might give rise to coupling between _ antiferromagnetic _ ( afm ) layers have been considered in these works .    yet",
    ", neutron diffraction data for three different sl systems composed of afm and nonmagnetic semiconducting materials , reported in the mid - nineties , revealed the existence of pronounced interlayer correlations between the afm blocks .",
    "also recently , coupling between fm  semiconductor layers has been found in eus / pbs sls @xcite . in these all - semiconductor systems ,",
    "the carrier concentration is far too low to support any significant rkky interactions ; in addition , the afm layers do not carry a net magnetic moment .",
    "thus , the two main ingredients which were believed to play a crucial role in interlayer coupling  mobile carriers and layer magnetization  are absent in these cases .",
    "these results have clearly demonstrated that the magnetic interlayer coupling is not restricted to structures containing fm metallic components .",
    "the proper understanding of correlations between the afm semiconductor layers may shed new light on the interlayer coupling mechanisms .",

    "however , in the eute epilayer and sl samples only the @xmath36 maximum is observed in the neutron diffraction spectra ; no detectable magnetic scattering was ever found at the other three reflection sites in any of the investigated specimens .",
    "this means that in the layer systems only a single @xmath38-domain state forms  the one in which the fm spin sheets are _ parallel _ to the eute layers  whereas the other three ` oblique ' configurations never occur .",
    "the observed preference in the @xmath38-domain formation can be explained by simple energy arguments . in the type ii afm structure",
    "a spin residing in a given fm sheet has six fm nearest neighbors ( nns ) located in the same sheet , and three afm ( ` frustrated ' ) nns in each adjacent sheet .",
    "the afm next - nearest neighbors ( nnns ) are also located in the adjacent sheets , three in each .",

    "the spins residing in monolayers with numbers @xmath53 have a full set of six parallel and six antiparallel nns , so that the total energy of the nn interactions for these spins is zero , regardless of the domain arrangement . however , the spins in the interface monolayers ( i.e. , those with @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) have only nine magnetic nns : 6(@xmath47)+3(@xmath49 ) for the ` in - plane ' and 4(@xmath47)+5(@xmath49 ) for the ` oblique ' domains . hence , due to the finite thickness of the layer , the exchange energy of the nn spins is not equal to zero any more and different for the in - plane and oblique configurations , with corresponding average magnetic energy per eu atom of : @xmath56 \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] and @xmath57 , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 . because @xmath59 , the ` in - plane ' spin arrangement is the one that minimizes the total magnetic energy .",
    "another factor that favors the ` in - plane ' domain configuration is strain . since @xmath60 , the eute lattice is ` compressed ' in the layer plane .",
    "therefore the distance @xmath61 between the nn eu ions located in the same ( 111 ) monolayer shortens , while , due to the lattice reaction to the strain the distance @xmath62 between the nns residing in the adjacent ( 111 ) monolayers increases .",

    "the @xmath65 exchange constants in eu chalcogenides generally increases with the decrease of the ion - ion separation .",
    "hence , one can expect the @xmath66 for the ` in - plane ' nns to be higher , and the @xmath67 for the ` out - of - plane ' nns lower than @xmath68 .",

    "no such preference was observed in the experimental data .    finally , in ref .",
    "a mechanism was presented , which attributes the interlayer coupling to the sensitivity of the sl electronic energies to the magnetic order in consecutive magnetic layers .",
    "the total energy of the valence electrons for two different magnetic sls , one with the same and the other with opposite spin configurations in neighboring magnetic layers , was compared .",
    "the difference between these two energies was considered as a measure of the strength of the interlayer magnetic coupling resulting from band structure effects . in ref .",

    "in this model the interlayer correlations are mediated by valence - band electrons and are inferred from the minimization of the total electronic energy of the eute / pbte system on the spin arrangements in adjacent magnetic layers . essentially , the major features of this theoretical model , namely :    * monotonic decay of the interlayer interactions with the distance between magnetic layers , * independence of coupling strength on magnetic layer thickness , and * opposite directions of the spins in the bounding monolayers of the two consecutive eute layers facing each other across the pbte spacer    have been confirmed in our neutron and magnetization experiments , although in order to be able to check experimentally the last issue ( especially for @xmath221 sls ) samples with extreme structural perfection were necessary .",
    "in this appendix we calculate the profiles of diffraction spectra for a sl made up of alternating @xmath20 antiferromagnetic layers and @xmath20 nonmagnetic layers , each consisting of @xmath16 and @xmath17 atomic monolayers , respectively . for simplicity , in the following it",
    "is assumed that in both sl constituent materials the spacing between the monolayers has the same value of @xmath222 and that there are only two possible directions of spin ( magnetization ) in each magnetic monolayer ( it can be shown , however , that the results of this appendix remain valid for systems with several in - plane easy axes and for layers consisting of many @xmath126-domains @xcite ) .      * _ perfectly correlated sls _",
    " interlayer correlations lead to one of the two types of magnetic order , illustrated in the diagrams in section  [ theory1 ] , in the entire sl ; * _ uncorrelated sls _ ; and * _ partially correlated sls _  structures , in which there is a dominant tendency to form one type of correlations between the successive magnetic layers , but due to some disruptive mechanisms a minority of nearest - neighbor layers pairs is aligned in the opposite way .    in the standard kinematical theory approach the diffracted wave , resulting from magnetic scattering of unpolarized neutrons ,",
    "is obtained by adding up all waves diffracted by individual magnetic atoms .",
    "this leads to the following equation : @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the scattering vector , @xmath225 is the single - atom magnetic formfactor , @xmath226 is the position of the @xmath227 atom , and @xmath228 is the magnetic scattering amplitude for a single atom , equal @xmath229 or @xmath230 for the `` up '' and `` down '' spin orientation , respectively . in the symmetric reflection geometry , most often used in diffraction studies of multilayers , the scattering vector is parallel to the superlattice axis : @xmath231 .",
    "the summation over individual atoms can be then replaced by a summation over the monolayers . since for all atoms located in the @xmath232 monolayer @xmath233 ,",
    "the equation simplifies to : @xmath234 where @xmath235 , the sum of magnetic scattering amplitudes of all atoms residing in the @xmath232 monolayer , is proportional to the monolayer magnetization . taking advantage of the sl periodicity , one can separate this equation into a summation over all monolayers within a sl `` elementary cell ''  a bilayer ( bl )  and over the @xmath20 sl repeats . thus , for a bilayer , consisting of @xmath16 magnetic monolayers ( and @xmath17 nonmagnetic ones , for which all the @xmath236 ) , one can define the magnetic structure factor @xmath237 as : @xmath238 eq .",
    "( [ ap2 ] ) can thus be written in the form : @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the sl period . the spin configuration in the @xmath241 magnetic layer with respect to the first layer",
    "is described in eq .",
    "( [ ap3 ] ) by the @xmath242 coefficient , which takes the value @xmath243 for the same and @xmath244 for the opposite magnetization sequences .",
    "the intensity @xmath245 of the diffracted radiation is given by : @xmath246 | f_{\\rm bl}(q_z)|^2 \\label{ap5}\\ ] ] where the structure factor square @xmath247 can be written as : @xmath248 the structure factor term @xmath249 has broad maxima ( with weak subsidiaries on both sides ) centered at @xmath250 , @xmath251 , i.e. , half - way in between the reciprocal lattice points corresponding to the basic atomic structure with periodicity @xmath222 .",
    "calculating the spectrum profiles @xmath245 for sls with _ perfect interlayer correlations _ requires putting in eq .",
    "( [ ap5 ] ) @xmath242 appropriate for the given type of correlation .",
    "the task reduces then to summing geometric progressions , which yields : for @xmath252        these functions consist of sharp maxima at regular intervals @xmath256 . the intensity of the narrow lines is `` modulated '' by the structure factor , what produces the characteristic groups of peaks .",
    "it should be noted that a change from one to another type of interlayer correlations causes the narrow line positions to shift by @xmath257 , which makes possible to detect such a transition .    in order to analyze _ uncorrelated _ and _ partially correlated _ sls the double sum in eq .",
    "( [ ap5 ] ) should be rearranged into sums over different kinds of layer pairs : namely , the sum of all same - layer terms ( @xmath258 ) , the sum of all terms with @xmath259 ( i.e. , corresponding to adjacent magnetic layers ) , all terms with @xmath260 ( i.e. , corresponding to next - nearest layer pairs ) , an so on :    @xmath261 = n + \\sum_{\\alpha\\ne\\beta}\\xi_\\alpha\\xi_\\beta\\cos[q_zd(\\alpha-\\beta ) ] \\nonumber \\nonumber\\\\ = n + 2\\cos(q_zd)\\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{n-2}\\xi_\\alpha \\xi_{\\alpha+1 } + 2\\cos(2q_zd)\\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{n-3}\\xi_\\alpha \\xi_{\\alpha+2 } + \\ldots+ 2\\cos[(n-1)q_zd]\\xi_0\\xi_{n-1 } \\label{ap8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the @xmath262 product for any pair of layers , labeled @xmath130 and @xmath263 , can be thought of as the _ correlation coefficient _ for this pair .",
    "the number of layer pairs that are @xmath264 apart is @xmath265 ; hence , the average correlation coefficient for all such pairs in the sl structure can be written as : @xmath266 using eqs .",
    "( [ ap8 ] ) and ( [ ap9 ] ) one can write the eq .",
    "( [ ap5 ] ) for diffracted intensity in a simple form : @xmath267 \\label{ap10}\\ ] ]    for a `` perfectly random '' superlattice the correlation coefficients for all layer pairs vanish on statistical averaging .",
    "hence , for the _ uncorrelated _ system : @xmath268 i.e. , the diffraction spectrum reproduces the shape of the structure factor square  in agreement with the expected result for a random system with no coherence between the waves scattered by individual layers .",
    "the last situation to discuss is the _ partially correlated _ superlattice . if it is assumed that the only relevant interactions are between the nearest layers , and there are no long - range interactions , which introduce coupling between the more distant layer pairs , then it is straightforward to show that the correlation coefficient for second - nearest layers is @xmath269 , for third - nearest layers is @xmath270 , etc . in the following",
    "we drop the subscript and denote @xmath271 by @xmath184 .",
    "if the value of @xmath206 is significantly lower than 1 , the correlation coefficients rapidly decrease , and only the first few terms in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ ap10 ] ) are relevant .",
