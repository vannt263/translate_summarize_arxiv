    "in the last years there have been several attempts to understand the diverse aspects of cosmology , as the presence of stable vacua and inflationary conditions , in the framework of supergravity and string theory @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting features emerging from these type of models consists on the study of the consequences of higher dimensional degrees of freedom on the cosmology derived from four - dimensional effective theories @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out that the presence of extra dimensions leads to an interesting connection with the ekpyrotic model @xcite , which generated considerable activity @xcite . the essential ingredient in these models",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) is to consider an effective action with a graviton and a massless scalar field , the dilaton , describing the evolution of the universe , while incorporating some of the ideas of pre - big - bang proposal @xcite in that the evolution of the universe began in the far past .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that relativistic theories of gravity such as general relativity or string theories are invariant under reparametrization of time .",
    "the quantization of such theories presents a number of problems of principle known as `` the problem of time '' @xcite .",
    "this problem is present in all systems whose classical version is invariant under time reparametrization , leading to its absence at the quantum level .",
    "therefore , the formal question involves how to handle the classical hamiltonian constraint , @xmath0 , in the quantum theory .",
    "also , connected with the problem of time is the `` hilbert space problem '' @xcite referring to the not at all obvious selection of the inner product of states in quantum gravity , and whether there is a need for such a structure at all .    the above features , as it is well known , point out the necessity to construct a consistent theory of gravity at quantum level .",
    "one promising attempt is string theory where the structure of the internal space plays a relevant role in the construction of interesting effective models containing cosmological features as the presence of positive valued minima of the scalar potential and slow - roll inflationary conditions .",
    "the usual procedure for that is to consider compactification on generalized manifolds , on which internal fluxes have back - reacted , altering the smooth calabi - yau geometry and stabilizing all the moduli @xcite .    in the present work we shall consider an alternative procedure about the role played by the moduli . in particular we shall not consider the presence of fluxes , as in string theory , in order to obtain a moduli - dependent scalar potential in the effective theory .",
    "rather , we are going to promote some of the moduli to time - dependent fields by considering the particular case of a ten - dimensional gravity coupled to a time - dependent dilaton compactified on a 6-dimensional torus with a time - dependent khler modulus . with the propose to track down the role",
    "play by such fields , we are going to ignore the dynamics of the complex structure field ( for instance , by assuming that it is already stabilized by the presence of a string field in higher scales ) .",
    "the work is organized in the following form . in section",
    "ii we present the construction of our effective action by compactification on a time - dependent torus , while in section iii we study its lagrangian and hamiltonian descriptions using as toy model the bianchi type ii cosmological model and we present the general structure for all bianchi class a models .",
    "section iv is devoted on finding the corresponding classical solutions for few different cases involving the presence or absence of matter content . in section",
    "v we present some solutions to the corresponding wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation in the context of standard quantum cosmology , resulting the modified bessel function @xmath1 , solutions that in some sense are similar to this find in previous work @xcite . in order that the unnormalized probability density @xmath2 does not diverge for @xmath3 and at fixed @xmath4 , which are the gravitational variables , we drop the function @xmath5 , remaining only the function @xmath6 .",
    "also in this section we make an analysis for particular case in the constants in the solution found in the asymptotic behavior for large argument in the gravitational variables and it is compare with the bohm s solutions obtained , finding that this corresponds to lowest - order wkb approximation .",
    "the bohm s solutions was obtained in other decomposition of the quantum wdw equation , related with the bohm s formalism , which was applied in the supersymmetric quantum cosmology @xcite . finally our conclusions are presented in section vi .",
    "we start from a ten - dimensional action coupled with a dilaton ( which is the bosonic component common to all superstring theories ) , which after dimensional reduction can be interpreted as a brans - dicke like theory @xcite . in the string frame ,",
    "the effective action depends on two time - dependent scalar fields : the dilation @xmath7 and the khler modulus @xmath8 , where the initial high - dimensional ( effective ) theory is given by    @xmath9 + 4\\,\\hat{g}^{mn}\\nabla_{m}\\,\\phi\\,\\nabla_{n}\\,\\phi\\bigg ] , \\label{action}\\ ] ]    with a metric described by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 are the indices of the 10-dimensional space , and greek and latin indices correspond to the external and internal space , respectively .",
    "the internal metric is given by    @xmath12    in order to rewrite it in the einstein frame , we take as usual , the conformal transformation of the four dimensional metric @xmath13 as    @xmath14    where @xmath13 is the metric in the string frame and @xmath15 is the metric in einstein frame and the dilaton has been redefined accordingly as @xmath16 .",
    "notice that in this way , the effective dilaton @xmath17 is also a time - dependent field . following this notion , we have that the action reads    @xmath18    where we have omitted the upper script @xmath19 in the metric .",
    "now with the expression we proceed to build the lagrangian and the hamiltonian of the theory at the classical regimen employing the anisotropic cosmological bianchi type ii model .",
    "in the last section we have built the reduced effective action , now we will construct the classical hamiltonian from the expression .",
    "we are going to assume that the background of the extended space ( four dimensional ) is a bianchi type ii anisotropic cosmological model . in order to do it ,",
    "let us recall here the canonical formulation in the adm formalism of the diagonal bianchi class a cosmological models .",
    "the metric has the form    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the lapse function , @xmath22 is a @xmath23 diagonal matrix , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are scalar functions known as misner variables , @xmath27 are one - forms that characterize each cosmological bianchi type model @xcite , and obey the form @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the structure constants of the corresponding model .",
    "the one - forms for the bianchi type ii model are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "so , the corresponding metric of the bianchi type ii in misner s parametrization has the form    @xmath33    substituting @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , we have the following form    @xmath37    the lagrangian density as effective theory for this model , including an intuitive way the matter content for a barotropic perfect fluid as a first approximation , has the structure @xcite    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the parameter that characterize the epochs in the evolution to the universe .",
