    "the _ clustering coefficient _ of a user in a social network is the proportion of pairs of its friends that are themselves friends .",
    "mean clustering coefficient _ for the network is the average clustering coefficient taken over all users .",
    "this concept was introduced by watts and strogatz @xcite to determine whether a given network is a ` small world ' network .",
    "it was reported in ugander et .",
    "al @xcite that the facebook graph is locally dense but globally sparse .",
    "indeed the clustering coefficient of vertices of small degree is close to @xmath11 and steadily decreases with increasing degree . in this paper",
    "we focus on the global cycle structure of graphs that are locally sufficiently dense . unless specified otherwise , all graphs under consideration are assumed to be connected and of order at least @xmath12 .    for graph theory terminology",
    "not introduced here we follow @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a graph and @xmath13 a vertex of @xmath1 .",
    "then the _ neighbourhood _ of @xmath13 , denoted by @xmath14 , is the set of all vertices adjacent with @xmath13 and the closed neighbourhood of @xmath13 is the set @xmath15 = n(v ) \\cup\\{v\\}$ ] .",
    "if @xmath5 is a set of vertices in a graph , then the _ subgraph induced _ by @xmath5 , denoted by @xmath16 , is the subgraph of @xmath1 with vertex set @xmath5 such that two vertices of @xmath5 are adjacent in @xmath16 if and only if they are adjacent in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph property .",
    "a graph @xmath1 is said to be _ locally _ @xmath0 ( _ closed locally _",
    "@xmath17 ) , if the subgraph induced by the open neighbourhood ( closed neighbourhood , respectively ) of every vertex in @xmath1 has property @xmath0 .",
    "the _ clustering coefficient _ of a vertex @xmath13 of degree @xmath18 , denoted by @xmath19 , is the ratio of the number of edges in the subgraph induced by @xmath14 to the maximum number of edges in a @xmath20-vertex graph , i.e , @xmath21 .",
    "the _ minimum clustering coefficient _ of a graph @xmath1 with minimum degree @xmath22 , denoted by @xmath23 , is the smallest clustering coefficient among all vertices of @xmath1 . in the sequel",
    "we assume that all graphs under consideration have minimum degree at least @xmath24 .",
    "if the minimum clustering coefficient of a class of graphs , is bounded by a constant @xmath25 , @xmath26 , then these graphs are said to be _ locally dense_. we observe that there are classes of graphs , although being locally dense , may be globally sparse with large diameter .",
    "for example , the class of graphs that are strong products ( see @xcite ) of a path @xmath27 of order @xmath28 and the complete graph @xmath29 of order @xmath24 , denoted by @xmath30 , has minimum clustering coefficient at least @xmath11 , is sparse since @xmath31 as @xmath32 and has diameter @xmath33 . in this paper",
    "we show that connected locally connected graphs with bounded maximum degree , for which the minimum clustering coefficient is at least 1/2 , have a rich cycle structure . in order to make these notions more precise we begin with pertinent definitions and relevant background on cycle properties in graphs that possess certain local properties .",
    "let @xmath1 be a graph of order @xmath34 .",
    "then @xmath1 is _ hamiltonian _ if @xmath1 has a cycle of length @xmath34 .",
    "if , in addition , @xmath1 has a cycle of every length from 3 up to @xmath34 , then @xmath1 is _ pancyclic _ , see @xcite . an even stronger notion than pancyclicity is that of ` full cycle extendability ' , introduced by hendry @xcite . a cycle @xmath7 in a graph @xmath1 is _ extendable _ if there exists a cycle @xmath35 in @xmath1 that contains all the vertices of @xmath7 and one additional vertex .",
    "the graph @xmath1 is _ cycle extendable _ if every nonhamiltonian cycle of @xmath1 is extendable .",
    "if , in addition , every vertex of @xmath1 lies on a 3-cycle , then @xmath1 is _ fully cycle extendable_. a condition weaker than pancyclicity has been the focus of a number of research articles .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote , respectively , the length of a shortest cycle , called the _ girth _ of @xmath1 , and a longest cycle , called the _ circumference _ of @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath1 is called _ weakly pancyclic _ if @xmath1 has a cycle of every length between @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the problem of determining whether or not a graph has a hamiltonian cycle",
    "is called the _ hamilton cycle",
    "problem_.    in 1974 , chartrand and pippert @xcite initiated the study of locally connected graphs .",
    "cycle properties of these graphs with bounded maximum degree have since been studied extensively - see for example @xcite .",
    "another class of graphs that has been widely studied in relation to the hamilton cycle problem , is the class of claw - free , i.e. @xmath38-free , graphs .",
    "these are precisely the graphs @xmath1 for which @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .",
    "thus claw - free graphs can also be described in terms of a local property .",
    "the hamilton cycle problem is np - complete for both locally connected graphs , see @xcite , and for claw - free graphs , see @xcite .",
    "the next result of oberly and sumner demonstrates the strength of combining these two local properties .    [ oberly and sumner ] _ @xcite _ if @xmath1 is a connected , locally connected claw - free graph , then @xmath1 is hamiltonian .",
    "clark @xcite showed that connected , locally connected claw - free graph are in fact pancyclic and hendry @xcite observed that clark had actually shown that these graphs are fully cycle extendable .",
    "these results support bondy s well - known ` meta - conjecture ' that almost any condition that guarantees that a graph has a hamilton cycle actually guarantees much more about the cycle structure of the graph .    if , in theorem [ oberly and sumner ] , the claw - free condition is dropped , hamiltonicity is no longer guaranteed .",
    "in fact , pareek and skupin @xcite observed that there exist infinitely many connected , locally hamiltonian graphs that are nonhamiltonian .",
    "however , clark s result led ryjek to suspect that every locally connected graph has a rich cycle structure , even if it is not hamiltonian .",
    "he proposed the following conjecture ( see @xcite . )",
    "[ ryjacek ] ( ryjek ) every locally connected graph is weakly pancyclic .",
    "ryjek s conjecture seems to be very difficult to settle , so it is natural to consider weaker conjectures .",
    "this conjecture has been studied , for example , for locally traceable and locally hamiltonian graphs with maximum degree at most 5 and 6 , respectively , see @xcite , neither of which need to be hamiltonian , see @xcite .",
    "one may well ask whether there are local connectedness conditions that guarantee ( global ) hamiltonicity .",
    "one such result was obtained by hasratian and kachatrian @xcite . recall that a graph @xmath1 of order @xmath41 has the ore property if @xmath42 for all pairs @xmath43 of non - adjacent vertices @xmath44 and @xmath13 of @xmath1 and it has the dirac property if @xmath45 for all @xmath40 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that closed locally ore graphs are hamiltonian and this result was subsequently strengthened in @xcite to full cycle extendability for these graphs .",
    "thus , in particular , all closed locally dirac graphs are fully cycle extendable . if a graph is closed locally dirac , then the clustering coefficient of each vertex is at least @xmath11 .",
    "this prompts the question : can the closed locally dirac condition can be weakened to requiring the graph to have minimum local clustering coefficient at least 1/2 while still guaranteeing hamiltonicity of the graph ?",
    "we show in this paper that locally connected graphs with minimum clustering coefficient at least @xmath11 need not be hamiltonian . nevertheless our results demonstrate that these graphs have a rich cycle structure and they lend support to ryjek s conjecture .",
    "the hamilton cycle problem for graphs with small maximum degree remains difficult , even when additional structural properties are imposed on the graph .",
    "for example , the hamilton cycle problem is np - complete for bipartite planar graphs with @xmath46 ( see @xcite ) , for @xmath47-regular graphs for any fixed @xmath47 ( see @xcite ) and even for planar cubic 3-connected claw - free graphs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , some progress has been made for locally connected graphs with small maximum degree .",
    "the first result in this connection was obtained in @xcite where it was shown that every connected , locally connected graph with maximum degree @xmath48 is either hamiltonian or isomorphic to the complete @xmath12-partite graph @xmath49 .",
    "all connected , locally connected graphs with maximum degree at most @xmath50 are described in @xcite .",
    "apart from @xmath49 , all of these graphs are actually fully cycle extendable . since @xmath49 is weakly pancyclic , ryjek s conjecture holds for locally connected graphs with maximum degree at most 4 .",
    "global cycle properties of connected , locally connected graphs with maximum degree 5 were investigated in @xcite .",
    "collectively these results imply that every connected , locally connected graph with @xmath51 and @xmath52 is fully cycle extendable .",
    "a graph @xmath1 is _ locally isometric _ if @xmath53 is an isometric subgraph ( distance preserving subgraph ) of @xmath1 for all @xmath40 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the hamilton cycle problem is np - complete even for locally isometric graphs with maximum degree @xmath54 .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown in @xcite that ryjek s conjecture holds for all locally isometric graphs with maximum degree 6 and without true twins ( i.e. , pairs of vertices having the same closed neighbourhood ) ; these graphs are in fact fully cycle extendable .",
    "let @xmath55 be vertices of a graph @xmath1 and @xmath5 a set of vertices of @xmath1 . if @xmath56 is adjacent with @xmath57 ( or every vertex of @xmath5 ) we write @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 , respectively ) .",
    "we use @xmath60 to indicate that @xmath56 is not adjacent with any vertex of @xmath5 .",
    "in this section we obtain a structural characterization of those connected , locally connected graphs with minimum clustering coefficient @xmath11 and maximum degree at most 6 that are fully cycle extendable . to state this characterization",
    "we introduce some useful definitions .",
    "let @xmath3 be a subgraph of a graph @xmath1 and let @xmath4 .",
    "we say that @xmath3 is a _ strongly induced subgraph _ of @xmath1 with _ attachment set _",
    "@xmath5 if @xmath3 is an induced subgraph of @xmath1 and the vertices of @xmath6 are not incident with edges that do not belong to @xmath3 , i.e. , only the vertices of @xmath5 may be incident with edges of @xmath1 that are not in @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a connected , locally connected graph with minimum clustering coefficient @xmath62 . if @xmath1 has maximum degree @xmath63 or @xmath12 , then @xmath1 is isomorphic to @xmath64 or either @xmath65 or @xmath66 , respectively ( where @xmath67 is an edge of @xmath65 ) .",
    "so @xmath1 is fully cycle extendable . if @xmath68 , then it is readily seen that @xmath1 is fully cycle - extendable unless @xmath69 .    for the remainder of this section we focus on graphs with @xmath70 .",
