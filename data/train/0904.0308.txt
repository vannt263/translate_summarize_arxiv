    "study of secure communication in the presence of an eavesdropper began with wyner@xcite .",
    "following wyner , csiszr & krner@xcite dealt with this topic . in this study , we consider a sender alice , an authorized receiver bob and an unauthorized receiver eve , who is referred to as a wire - tapper .",
    "this research treats two channels , a channel to bob and a channel to eve ; such a model is called a wire - tap channel . whereas the studies above treated the discrete memoryless case , hayashi@xcite derived a general capacity formula for an arbitrary sequence of wire - tap channels . in this model ,",
    "amount of eve s accessible information is evaluated by the mutual information @xmath2 between alice s and eve s variables with the code @xmath3 , and is abbreviated to eve s information .",
    "several papers @xcite in cryptography community adopt the leaked information criterion based on the variational distance while several papers @xcite in information theory community adopt the leaked information criterion based on the mutual information .",
    "as is illustrated in appendix iii , there exists an example where the leaked information criterion based on the mutual information is more restrictive than that based on variational distance .",
    "hence , we adopt the leaked information criterion based on the mutual information .",
    "as was shown by csiszr @xcite , in the discrete memoryless case , if the transmission rate is less than the capacity and if we choose suitable codes , eve s information goes to zero exponentially .",
    "that is , when the given channel is used with @xmath4 times , eve s information @xmath5 with a suitable code @xmath6 behaves as @xmath7 . in order to estimate the speed of the convergence , we focus on the _ exponential decreasing rate _ of eve s information , which is referred to as the _ exponent _ of eve s information : @xmath8 hayashi@xcite estimates this exponent for the wire - tap channels in the discrete memoryless case .",
    "this type of evaluation is quite useful for estimating eve s information from a finite - length code .",
    "the first purpose of this paper is to improve the previous exponent of eve s information .    on the other hand , using the rnyi entropy of order 2 , bennett et al @xcite evaluate eve s information after the application of a universal@xmath9 hashing function@xcite .",
    "their result gives an upper bound of eve s information for the generation of a secret key from a common random number without communication .",
    "renner and wolf @xcite and renner @xcite improved this approach and obtained evaluations based on smooth rnyi entropy .",
    "renner @xcite applied his method to the security analysis of quantum key distribution .",
    "however , no research studied the relation between these results related to various kinds of rnyi entropies and the above results concerning wire - tap channel .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to generalize bennett et al @xcite s result and to apply it to wire - tap channel model . as the first step , in section [ s4 ]",
    ", we focus on secret key generation from a common random number without communication . even in this model",
    ", we highlight the exponent of eve s information in the case of independent and identical distribution ( i.i.d .",
    "case ) . in subsection",
    "[ s41 ] , we extend the result of bennett et al @xcite to the case of the rnyi entropy of order @xmath0 for @xmath1 $ ] and obtain a new upper bound for eve s information in this problem as the main theorem .",
    "we apply this bound to the i.i.d .",
    "case . then",
    ", derived a lower bound of the exponent of eve s information . in subsection [ s42 ] , we also apply renner and wolf @xcite s method to the evaluation of the exponent of eve s information .",
    "then , another lower bound is derived based on smooth rnyi entropy .",
    "it is shown that the lower bound based on rnyi entropy of order @xmath0 is better than that based on smooth rnyi entropy .    in section [ s2 ] , applying the evaluation obtained in subsection [ s41 ] , we derive an upper bound for eve s information from random coding in a wire - tap channel .",
    "the upper bound obtained here satisfies the concavity property with respect to the distribution of alice s system .",
    "this property is essential for connecting this proof with secret key generation from a common random number without communication .",
    "the method we present contrasts with the method in hayashi@xcite .",
    "hayashi@xcite deals with channel resolvability and applies it to the security of wire - tap channel ; this approach was strongly motivated by devetak @xcite and winter et al @xcite . in section [ s6 ] , we show that this upper bound for eve s information is better than hayashi@xcite s bound for the wire - tap channel model .    in a realistic setting , it is usual to restrict our codes to linear codes .",
    "however , no existing result gives a code satisfying the following conditions : ( 1 ) the code is constructed by linear codes .",
    "( 2 ) eve s information exponentially goes to zero when the transmission rate is smaller than the difference between the mutual information from alice to bob and that to eve . in section [ s3 ]",
    ", we make a code satisfying the above conditions .",
    "that is , we make our code generated by a combination of arbitrary linear codes and privacy amplification by the concatenation of toeplitz matrix @xcite and the identity . under this kinds of code",
    ", we obtain the same upper bound for eve s information .",
    "when the channel is an _ additive _ channel , i.e. , the probability space and the set of input signals are given as the same finite module and the probability transition matrix @xmath10 corresponding to the channel is given as @xmath11 with a probability distribution on the finite module .",
    "this fact holds when the channel is a variant of an additive channel .    in section [ s5 ] , we also apply our result to secret key agreement with public discussion , which has been treated by ahlswede & csiszr@xcite , maurer@xcite , and muramatsu@xcite et al .",
    "maurer @xcite and ahlswede & csiszr@xcite showed that the optimal key generation rate is the difference of conditional entropies @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the random variables for alice , bob , and eve , respectively .",
    "csiszr@xcite , renner@xcite , and naito et al @xcite mentioned the existence of a bound for eve s information that exponentially goes to zero when the key generation rate is smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "however , no existing result clearly gives a lower bound for the exponential decreasing rate for eve s information when the key generation rate is smaller than @xmath12 . applying our result",
    ", we obtain such a lower bound for the exponential decreasing rate for eve s information . in this case",
    ", we apply our code to a wire - tap channel with a variant of additive channels .",
    "our protocol can be realized by a combination of a linear code and privacy amplification by the concatenation of toeplitz matrix @xcite and the identity .    in appendix",
    "[ s7 ] , we prove the main theorem mentioned in section [ s4 ] . in appendix",
    "[ stoep ] , we show that the concatenation of toeplitz matrix @xcite and the identity is a universal@xmath9 hashing function @xcite .",

    "the task is to extract a common random number @xmath19 from the random number @xmath16 , which is almost independent of eve s random number @xmath17 . here",

    ", we define the functions @xmath21 using these functions , we can define rnyi entropy of order @xmath0 @xmath22 and the conditional rnyi entropy of order @xmath0 : @xmath23 if there is no possibility for confusion , @xmath24 is omitted .    now , we focus on an ensemble of the functions @xmath25 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes a random variable describing the stochastic behavior of the function @xmath20 .",
    "an ensemble of the functions @xmath25 is called universal@xmath9 when it satisfies the following condition@xcite :    @xmath29 , the probability that @xmath30 is at most @xmath31 .",
    "we sometimes require the following additional condition :    for any @xmath28 , the cardinality of @xmath32 does not depend on @xmath33 .",
    "this condition will be used in section iii .",
    "indeed , when the cardinality @xmath34 is a power of a prime power @xmath35 and @xmath36 is another power of the same prime power @xmath35 , an ensemble @xmath37 satisfying the both conditions is given by the the concatenation of toeplitz matrix and the identity @xmath38@xcite only with @xmath39 random variables taking values in the finite filed @xmath40 .",
    "that is , the matrix @xmath38 has small complexity . the construction and its proof are given in appendix [ stoep ] .",
    "when @xmath36 is an arbitrary integer and the cardinality @xmath34 is an arbitrary multiple of @xmath36 , an ensemble @xmath37 satisfying the both conditions is given in the following way .",
    "first , we fix a function @xmath20 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 such that the cardinality @xmath41 is @xmath42 .",
    "we randomly choose an permutation @xmath43 on @xmath26 with the uniform distribution , where @xmath44 denotes the set of permutation on @xmath26 .",
    "so , we can make a random function @xmath45 .",
    "this ensemble satisfies the both conditions .    as is shown in the appendix [ s7 ] , we obtain the following theorem .",
    "when the ensemble of the functions @xmath37 is universal@xmath9 , it satisfies @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "note that bennett et al @xcite proved this inequality for the case of @xmath48 .",
    "since the mutual information @xmath49 is bounded by @xmath50 , we obtain @xmath51    this inequality implies the following theorem .",
    "there exists a function @xmath20 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 such that @xmath52    in the following , we mainly use the quantity @xmath53 instead of @xmath54 . because the usage of @xmath54 requires more complicated calculation .",
    "next , we consider the case when our distribution @xmath55 is given by the @xmath4-fold independent and identical distribution of @xmath56 , i.e , @xmath57 .",
    "ahlswede and csiszr @xcite showed that the optimal generation rate @xmath58 equals the conditional entropy @xmath59 .",
    "that is , the generation rate @xmath60 is smaller than @xmath59 , eve s information @xmath61 goes to zero . in order to treat the speed of this convergence , we focus on the supremum of the _ exponentially decreasing rate ( exponent ) _ of @xmath61 for a given @xmath62 @xmath63 since the relation @xmath64 holds , the inequality ( [ 4 - 25 - 1 ] ) implies that @xmath65 since @xmath66 , eve s information @xmath61 exponentially goes to zero for @xmath67 .",
    "rnyi entropy of order @xmath68 @xmath69 is bounded by the min - entropy @xmath70",
    "i.e. , the inequality @xmath71 holds .",

    "this definition is different from that of renner @xcite . modifying the discussion by renner and wolf @xcite",
    ", we can derive another upper bound of @xmath75 based on the smooth min - entropy @xmath76 in the following way .    using the variational distance @xmath77 : @xmath78 we have the continuity of the shannon entropy in the following sense : when @xmath79 , the function @xmath80 satisfies the following inequality : @xmath81 based on the variational distance , we define the following modification : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a probability distribution .",

    "next , we consider the wire - tap channel model , in which the eavesdropper ( wire - tapper ) , eve and the authorized receiver bob receive information from the authorized sender alice . in this case , in order for eve to have less information , alice chooses a suitable encoding .",

    "let @xmath119 and @xmath120 be the probability spaces of bob and eve , and @xmath121 be the set of alphabets sent by alice .",

    "therefore , if the error correcting code @xmath240 can be constructed with effective encoding and decoding times and @xmath165 is additive or general additive , the code @xmath249 for a wire - tap channel satisfying the inequality ( [ 4 - 27 - 2 ] ) or ( [ 4 - 27 - 3 ] ) can be constructed by using random linear privacy amplification .",
    "furthermore , for the @xmath4-fold discrete memoryless case of the wire - tap channel @xmath276 , it is possible to achieve the rate @xmath277 by a combination of this error correcting and random linear privacy amplification when an error correcting code attaining the shannon rate @xmath278 is available and the channel @xmath165 is general additive , i.e. , @xmath279 . in this case , when the sacrifice information rate is @xmath62 , as follows from the discussion of section [ s6 ] and ( [ 2 - 13 - 1 ] ) , the exponent of eve s information is greater than @xmath280 .",
    "this method is very useful when the channels @xmath190 and @xmath165 are additive .",
    "however , even if the channels are not additive or general additive , this method is still useful because it requires only a linear code and random privacy amplification , which is simpler requirement than that of the random coding method given in the proof of theorem [ 3 - 6 ] while this method can not attain the optimal rate .",
    "next , following maurer@xcite , we apply the above discussions to secret key agreement , in which , alice , bob , and eve are assumed to have initial random variables @xmath281 , @xmath282 , and @xmath283 , respectively . the task for alice and bob is to share a common random variable almost independent of eve s random variable @xmath90 by using a public communication .",
    "the quality is evaluated by three quantities : the size of the final common random variable , the probability that their final variables coincide , and the mutual information between alice s final variables and eve s random variable . in order to construct a protocol for this task , we assume that the set @xmath284 has a module structure ( any finite set can be regarded as a cyclic group ) . then , the objective of secret key agreement can be realized by applying the code of a wire - tap channel as follows .",
    "first , alice generates another uniform random variable @xmath257 and sends the random variable @xmath285 .",
    "then , the distribution of the random variables @xmath286 ( @xmath287 ) accessible to bob ( eve ) can be regarded as the output distribution of the channel @xmath288 ( @xmath289 ) .",
    "the channels @xmath290 and @xmath291 are given as follows .",
    "@xmath292 where @xmath293 ( @xmath294 ) is the joint probability between alice s initial random variable @xmath18 and bob s ( eve s ) initial random variable @xmath295 ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "hence , the channel @xmath165 is general additive .",
    "applying theorem [ 3 - 6 ] to the uniform distribution @xmath296 , for any numbers @xmath36 and @xmath297 , there exists a code @xmath3 such that @xmath298 because @xmath299 . and @xmath300 .    in particular , when @xmath121 is an @xmath4-dimensional vector space @xmath262 over the finite field @xmath40 and the joint distribution between @xmath13 and @xmath14(@xmath15 ) is the @xmath4-fold independent and identical distribution ( i.i.d",
    "of @xmath301 ( @xmath302 ) , respectively , the relation @xmath303 holds .",
    "thus , there exists a code @xmath6 for any integers @xmath192 , and any probability distribution @xmath156 on @xmath121 such that @xmath304 hence , the achievable rate of this protocol is equal to @xmath305 which was obtained by maurer@xcite and ahlswede - csiszr@xcite . here , since the channels @xmath190 and @xmath165 can be regarded as general additive , we can apply the discussion in section [ s3 ] .",
    "that is , the bound ( [ 2 - 13 - 2 ] ) can be attained with the combination of a linear code and random privacy amplification , which is given in section [ s3 ] .",
    "we have derived an upper bound for eve s information in secret key generation from a common random number without communication when a universal@xmath9 hash function is applied . since our bound is based on the rnyi entropy of order @xmath0 for @xmath1 $ ] , it can be regarded as an extension of bennett et al @xcite s result with the rnyi entropy of order 2 .    applying this bound to the wire - tap channel , we obtain an upper bound for eve s information , which yields an exponential upper bound .",
    "this bound improves on the existing bound @xcite .",
    "further , when the error correction code is given by a linear code and when the channel is additive or general additive , the privacy amplification is given by the concatenation of toeplitz matrix and the identity . finally , our result has been applied to secret key agreement with public communication .",

    "the author is grateful to professor ryutaroh matsumoto for a helpful comment for proof of theorem 2 and inequalities ( [ 4 - 27 - 2 ] ) and ( [ 4 - 27 - 3 ] ) , and interesting discussions .",
    "the author thanks professors renato renner and shun watanabe for helpful discussions .",
    "in particular , he greatly thanks professor shun watanabe for allowing him to including his example mentioned in appendix iii .",
    "he is also grateful to the referees for helpful comments concerning this manuscript .",
    "the concavity of @xmath306 implies that @xmath307 condition [ c1 ] guarantees that @xmath308 since any two positive numbers @xmath257 and @xmath129 satisfy @xmath309 for @xmath161 , @xmath310 hence , @xmath311 therefore , taking the expectation with respect to the random variable @xmath15 , we have @xmath312 the concavity of the logarithm implies @xmath313 thus , from ( [ 5 - 14 - 2 ] ) , the concavity of the logarithm yields that @xmath314 where the last inequality follows from the logarithmic inequality @xmath315 .",
    "therefore , we obtain ( [ 5 - 14 - 1 ] ) .",
    "the concatenation of toeplitz matrix and the identity @xmath38 of size @xmath267 on the finite filed @xmath40 is given as follows .",
    "first , we choose an @xmath264 random variables @xmath265 on the finite filed @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath316 is the @xmath317 identity matrix and the @xmath318 matrix @xmath319 is defined by the @xmath264 random variables @xmath265 as follows .",
    "@xmath320 this matrix is called a toeplitz matrix .    now , we prove that the @xmath267 matrices @xmath38 satisfy condition [ c2 ] .",
    "more precisely , we show the following .",
    "( 1 ) an element @xmath321 belongs to the kernel of @xmath38 with probability @xmath322 if @xmath323 and @xmath324 .",
    "( 2 ) it does not belong to the kernel of the @xmath267 matrix @xmath38 if @xmath325 and @xmath324 .    indeed ,",
    "since ( 2 ) is trivial , we will show ( 1 ) . for @xmath326 , we let @xmath33 be the minimum index @xmath33 such that @xmath327 .",
    "we fix the @xmath328 random variables @xmath329 .",
    "that is , we show that the element @xmath330 belongs to the kernel with probability @xmath322 when the @xmath328 random variables @xmath329 are fixed .",
    "then , the condition @xmath331 can be expressed as the following @xmath332 conditions . @xmath333",
    "the @xmath334-th condition does not depend on the @xmath335 variables @xmath336 .",
    "hence , this condition only depends on the variable @xmath337 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath334-th condition holds with probability @xmath338 .",
    "similarly , we can show that the @xmath339-th condition holds with probability @xmath338 under the @xmath334-th condition .",
    "thus , the @xmath334-th condition and the @xmath339-th condition hold with probability @xmath340 . repeating this discussion inductively",
    ", we can conclude that all @xmath332 conditions hold with probability @xmath341 .",
    "in this appendix , we explain an example , in which , the leaked information criterion based on the variational distance is small but the leaked information criterion based on the mutual information is large .",
    "this example is proposed by shun watanabe@xcite .",
    "the former criterion is given as @xcite @xmath342 where @xmath343 is the uniform distribution on @xmath284 and the variational distance is given as @xmath344 .",
    "pinsker inequality @xcite guarantees that @xmath345 where @xmath346 .",
    "this inequality shows that when @xmath347 and @xmath348 are close to zero , @xmath349 is also close to zero .",
    "assume that the eve s distribution @xmath350 is the uniform distribution , and @xmath351 .",
    "for any small real number @xmath352 , we define a subset @xmath353 such that @xmath354 .",
    "the conditional distribution @xmath355 is assumed to be given as @xmath356 where @xmath357 is @xmath358 when @xmath359 , and is @xmath360 otherwise .",
    "then , the leaked information criterion based on the variational distance is evaluated as @xmath361 in oder to evaluate the leaked information criterion based on the mutual information , we focus on the probability @xmath362 fano inequality@xcite yields that @xmath363 since @xmath364 , @xmath365 in particular , when @xmath366 and @xmath367 , @xmath368    this example shows that even if @xmath349 is close to zero , there is a possibility that @xmath369 is not close to zero .",
    "hence , we can not guarantee the security based on mutual information from the security based on variational distance while we can guarantee the security based on variational distance from the security based on mutual information when @xmath370 is close to zero .",
    "therefore , the leaked information criterion based on the mutual information is more restrictive than that based on variational distance .",
