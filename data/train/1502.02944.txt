    "moreover , the system of energy levels of @xmath4 point particles _ has no _ level corresponding to @xmath336 phonons in a gas of @xmath4 nonpoint particles .",
    "that is , some states of a gas of nonpoint particles have an analog in a gas of point particles , whereas another states do not have .",
    "intuitively it seems that a real system of @xmath337 bose particles can hold @xmath338 oscillatory waves ( phonons ) .",
    "it is possible that , for finite @xmath289 the excitations for point particles are defined not quite self - consistently .",
    "we have shown above that , for a weak and intermediate couplings , the dispersion law for point bosons does depend on the presence of boundaries , whereas the ground - state energy is independent of boundaries ( to within the surface correction @xmath339 ) .",
    "why is it so as regards equations ? as was shown in sec .",
    "iii , the equations for the ground state for systems with zero and periodic bcs differ from each other only by two terms , which are small for large @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "however , for zero bcs , the low - lying excitations are not phonons . in order to see this ,",
    "let us compare the microscopic sound velocity @xmath343 with the macroscopic one @xmath344 @xmath345 @xcite . under the periodic bcs , they are identical @xcite .",
    "therefore , the excitations with small @xmath239 can be interpreted as phonons . under zero bcs ,",
    "the system is characterized by the same @xmath15 and @xmath346 , but by the different value of @xmath347 , being approximately @xmath348 times over @xmath346 at @xmath349 .",

    "for @xmath353 we have @xmath354 , and the excitations can be considered as phonons . which structure of the wave function ( wf ) under zero bcs should be in order that an excitation be a phonon ?",
    "the total wfs are not eigenfunctions of the operator of total momentum even for @xmath355 . but the wf can contain a multiplier corresponding to two counter - propagating waves . in this case , the wf of a low - energy state should have the form @xmath356 where the function @xmath357 is an eigenfunction of the total operator of momentum with the eigenvalue @xmath0 .",
    "the structure of ( [ 5 - 1 ] ) is phonon - like .",
    "if such representation is possible , then the excited state has the phonon structure and is characterized by the quasimomentum @xmath0 . in this case , the relation @xmath354 should hold .",
    "but since @xmath346 is the same as for periodic bcs , the dispersion law @xmath1 should coincide with that for a periodic system .",
    "we do not know whether a representation of the form ( [ 5 - 1 ] ) exists .    according to solutions @xcite ,",
    "the boundaries of a system of nonpoint bosons affect both the dispersion law and the ground - state energy . for a 1d system of almost point bosons with the weak interaction and zero bcs ,",
    "the following dispersion law is found @xcite : @xmath358 for the solutions @xcite , the equality @xmath354 holds ; this can be verified for the weak coupling .",
    "the dispersion law ( [ 5 - 18 ] ) is characterized by the sound velocity , which is @xmath359 times less than the bogolyubov one ( see ( [ 3 - 18 ] ) ) . however , for the point bosons in a box , the effective @xmath347 is larger than the bogolyubov @xmath360 .",
    "if there exists a continuous transition from a nonpoint interaction to the point one , then the noncoincidence of solutions @xcite with those for point bosons indicates the incorrectness of either solutions @xcite or the solutions of the present work .",
    "however , we solved the gaudin equations for @xmath81 by two different methods and are sure in the validity of the solutions .",
    "in addition , if there is no phonon representation for excitations of a gas of point bosons under zero bcs , we are faced with the difficulty for the theory of point bosons . indeed , for the real quantum bose liquids , the low - lying excitations are phonons .",
    "this is testified , for example , by the experiments on the scattering of neutrons and by the measurements of the heat capacity of 3d he ii in a vessel ( zero bcs ) .",
    "the distinction of the one- and three - dimensional cases should not be important , because several microscopic models of he ii @xcite work in 1d and 3d and give for 1d and 3d the solutions of the same structure .    as a possible reason for all disagreements",
    ", we can indicate the absence of a continuous transition from a nonpoint interaction to the point one , i.e. , the anomality of the @xmath361-function .",
    "the @xmath361-function is a singular generalized function .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the replacement of a real potential by the @xmath361-function is admissible . in particular , it was proved mathematically @xcite that the energy levels of a system of 3d bosons in a very extended trap are close to those of the lieb ",
    "liniger problem . however , the wave functions of @xmath4 nonpoint and @xmath4 point particles have different forms @xcite .",
    "is it the different forms of the same functions or the evidence of the difference of the functions ?",
    "it is known only @xcite that , under periodic bcs , the wfs of point bosons with @xmath355 can be written as the zero approximation for the wfs of nonpoint bosons .",
    "it is necessary to show that , for an @xmath4-particle 1d system , all energy levels and the wfs for the almost point and point interactions coincide . in the appendix , this is proved for the one - particle problem .",
    "the same should be proved at least for @xmath362 as well .",
    "it is of interest that , in the 2d- and 3d - spaces , the potential @xmath363 has no influence on the solutions of the schrdinger equation for some tasks @xcite .",
    "the equations for spin systems and point bosons are similar @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the dispersion laws of spin waves under zero and periodic bcs should be different ( by our method of determination of @xmath0 ) , whereas the thermodynamic quantities should coincide . from whence",
    ", we may conclude that the difference of the curves @xmath1 is unobservable .",
    "but it was shown in experiments on the scattering of neutrons that the low - lying excitations of magnetics with boundaries ( zero bcs ) are quite observable and have quasimomentum .",
    "the possible reason is that the spin wave is accompanied by the sound wave .",
    "an important point is that the contact hamiltonian describes well the real exchange interaction and contains no @xmath361-function .",
    "therefore , the solutions should correspond to the natural properties , and disagreements due to the @xmath361-function should not arise .",
    "such a deductive method indicates that the problems of solutions for spin waves and point bosons under zero bcs are not , apparently , related to the @xmath361-function .",
    "we have obtained two main results : 1 ) it is found that the dispersion law @xmath1 of a system of point bosons depends strongly on boundaries in the regimes of weak and intermediate coupling .",
    "2 ) the thermodynamics of a gas of point bosons is constructed by a new method .",
    "our analysis shows that the values of thermodynamic quantities are independent of the boundaries . by our method of determination of the quasimomentum @xmath0 of an excitation",
    ", it turns out that , under zero bcs , the low - energy excitations are characterized by a linear dispersion law and a nonphonon structure of the wave function .",
    "it seems strange , because the experiment indicates that the low - lying excitations of real uniform quantum liquids with zero boundary conditions are phonons .",
    "it is possible that there exists a way of determination of @xmath0 under zero bcs , for which the low - energy excitations are phonons .",
    "otherwise , the solutions for point bosons do not describe the real low - lying modes , and we meet an internal difficulty of theory .",
