    "a measurement of the differential cross section for elastic neutron - proton ( @xmath0 ) scattering is notoriously difficult .",
    "it is even so difficult that almost none of the data sets measured at energies below the pion - production threshold is completely free of systematic flaws . in partial - wave analyses ( pwa s ) of the @xmath0 scattering data",
    "@xcite some of these flaws do not give rise to sizable systematic contributions to @xmath1 .",
    "data sets with such minor flaws will not distort too much the statistics  @xcite in these pwa s , and therefore such sets can be included in the database ; examples are the lampf data  @xcite and the triumf data  @xcite .",
    "some flaws , on the other hand , are so serious that their contribution to @xmath1 dominates over the statistical contribution to the extent that the standard rules of statistics no longer apply .",
    "consequently , such data sets  @xcite must be excluded from the databases used in pwa s .",
    "this is of course an unfortunate and undesirable situation , especially in view of the waste of investment and effort involved in these experiments .    in this paper",
    "we present the `` adnorm '' method .",
    "this is a method of angle - dependent normalization  @xcite to treat certain systematically - flawed @xmath0 differential cross sections .",
    "this adnorm method is meant to be used only in good , energy - dependent pwa s .",
    "we will show that the application of this method to certain data sets , which were previously unacceptable in energy - dependent pwa s , can give impressive results .",
    "the values of @xmath1 drop dramatically and can even become statistically acceptable .",
    "this implies that these data sets can , instead of discarding them , from now on be included in the @xmath0 database .",
    "the salvation of these systematically - flawed data sets  @xcite is a major accomplishment of our adnorm method .    in recent publications  @xcite we pointed out that the uppsala data at 162 mev  @xcite contain unexplained large systematic errors .",
    "also some other @xmath0 differential cross section measurements appeared to have systematic errors similar ( but not identical ) to the uppsala data ; the princeton  @xcite and freiburg  @xcite data are prominent examples .    in the following",
    "we will compare the data in the standard way with the energy - dependent nijmegen partial - wave analysis pwa93",
    "first of all we will establish that these flawed data sets have significant , smoothly angle - dependent , systematic errors .",
    "since we have no explanation for these systematic experimental errors , we must simply accept the fact that certain data have such errors .",
    "we are surprised , however , that so many @xmath0 differential cross sections have such similar , angle - dependent systematic errors .",
    "then we will apply the adnorm method to these data and demonstrate that this method can correct for some of such systematic errors . in order to save two sizable data sets , which became almost acceptable after using the adnorm method , we changed slightly the definition of an individual outlier .",
    "this has nothing to do with the adnorm method , but it is a measure taken in the same spirit : try to be as frugal as possible with data sets , and do not omit them from the data base , unless absolutely necessary . in this way",
    "we obtain normalized data sets that are statistically acceptable and that can be included henceforth in the @xmath0 databases for pwa s .",
    "an @xmath0 differential cross section @xmath2 , consisting of @xmath3 data points , is called _ experimentally _ normalized , when for this data set the normalization has actually been measured . in that case",
    ", it has an experimental norm @xmath4 with a corresponding experimental error @xmath5 . this norm and error",
    "are included as a datum in the data base . for backward @xmath0 scattering",
    "this error is often of the order of 4% or larger . in the nijmegen pwa s",
    "we also determine for each data set the normalization @xmath6 with an error @xmath7 .",
    "this is a _ calculated _ normalization ( for a discussion of these points see ref .",
    "this error @xmath7 is in most cases less than 1%  @xcite .",
    "when these two normalizations @xmath8 and @xmath6 differ by more than 3 standard deviations ( s.d . ) , we remove the experimental normalization and its error from the database .",
    "the data set is then `` floated '' , which means in practice that a very large normalization error is assigned to the data set .",
    "a data set is also floated when its normalization has not been measured at all . in the case of floated data the calculated normalization @xmath6",
    "is determined solely by the angular distribution .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom @xmath9 for a set with @xmath3 data points is then @xmath10 . for the determination of the calculated normalization @xmath6",
    "we have sacrificed one degree of freedom .    for seriously flawed data sets one can not get a sufficiently low value of @xmath1 by merely adjusting or floating the normalization .",
    "such data sets are then omitted from the data base for pwa s .",
    "the main point of this paper is the observation that for some of such unacceptable data sets we can introduce an _ angle - dependent _ normalization @xmath11 in such a way that we essentially sacrifice _ two or more _ degrees of freedom to obtain significant drops in the value of @xmath1 .",
    "such a sacrifice is unfortunately necessary in our attempt to save these data sets from being discarded otherwise .    in the adnorm method",
    "we have to make assumptions when we are trying to parametrize the angular dependence of the systematic errors .",
    "we first map the experimental angular interval @xmath12 $ ] onto the interval @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "this mapping can be done in many ways .",
    "we consider the two mappings @xmath14 with @xmath15 , and @xmath16 with @xmath17",
    ".    for the discrete set of @xmath3 data points @xmath18 @xmath19 on the @xmath20-interval @xmath13 $ ] we define the inner product @xmath21 .",
    "this allows us to construct the polynomials @xmath22 , which are orthogonal with respect to this inner product and normalized such that @xmath23 .",
    "next we expand @xmath11 in these orthogonal polynomials @xmath24 on this discrete set of data points .",
    "we write @xmath25 \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : norm}\\ ] ] we allow for the introduction of an extra function @xmath26 . in practical cases we make the simplest choice @xmath27 , but _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath28 could also be a suitable choice .",
    "the expansion in orthogonal polynomials gives exactly the same @xmath11 as a power series expansion up to the same power @xmath29 . in the case of a power series expansion the coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 vary very much with the value of @xmath29 , this is not the case anymore for an expansion in orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the normalization @xmath30 and the @xmath29 adnorm parameters @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and their errors are determined by the least - squares method , where the data are compared with pwa93 . in an actual pwa such data sets contribute with @xmath33 degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath1 that results when @xmath29 adnorm parameters are introduced is called @xmath34 . when the standard angle - independent normalization ( with zero adnorm parameters ) is applied , the @xmath1 is called @xmath35 .",
    "how many adnorm parameters @xmath31 do we have to introduce ?",
    "the basic rule is that each introduced parameter should cause a _",
    "significant _ drop in @xmath1 .",
    "we apply a 3 s.d .",
    "criterion : we introduce the parameter @xmath31 only when @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter is then significant .",
    "this procedure of introducing additional parameters stops when no significant drop in @xmath1 can be achieved anymore .",
    "when we end up with nonzero adnorm parameters , then we have shown that there are significant angle - dependent systematic errors present in the data , and we have explicitly parametrized these systematic errors .",
    "we have convinced ourselves that the final result of the parametrization is essentially independent of our specific assumptions .",
    "the renormalized differential cross sections , obtained by different ways of parametrization , were statistically practically the same .",
    "let us see how this procedure works out for the uppsala data  @xcite at @xmath37 mev . at this neutron beam energy",
    "the @xmath0 differential cross section was measured in five overlapping angular regions .",
    "we ordered these sets by increasing neutron scattering angles and called the sets 1 to 5 , where set 1 contains the data at the most forward angles and set 5 at the most backward angles  @xcite .",
    "these data were then compared to pwa93 .",
    "we removed the point at 93@xmath38 from set 2 because it contributes more than 9 ( 3 s.d . ) to @xmath1 .    in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] we list the number of data @xmath3 in each set , the value @xmath35 obtained by just applying the standard angle - independent normalization ( all adnorm parameters @xmath39 ) , the values of @xmath40 obtained by applying the @xmath41-adnorm method of eq .",
    "[ eq : map1 ] , and the values of @xmath42 obtained by applying the @xmath43-adnorm method of eq .",
    "[ eq : map2 ] .    from this table  [ tab:1 ] we see that the fits of the sets 1 and 4 improve significantly ( a drop in @xmath1 of much more than 9 ) when introducing only one adnorm parameter @xmath44 . for sets 2 and 3 this is not true , and we will therefore take @xmath45 for these two sets . for set 5 we need two @xmath41-adnorm parameters , while only one @xmath43-adnorm parameter is necessary . after the @xmath41-adnorm method",
    "is applied with only one adnorm parameter the slope of the angle - dependent normalization @xmath11 is called @xmath46 .",
    "the value of this slope can be found in the next - to - last row of table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "this slope is used to compare systematic errors in different experiments .",
    "it is important to note that the slope for set 1 is positive , while the slopes for the sets 4 and 5 are negative . in the last row",
    "is given the variation in % of the normalization @xmath11 in the case @xmath29=1 over the interval @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the combined data set has @xmath47 and when normalized in the standard angle - independent way ( no adnorm parameters ) we obtain @xmath48 .",
    "this value is 12 s.d .",
    "higher than the expectation value @xmath49 .",
    "the value for @xmath1 drops to @xmath50 after introducing four @xmath41-adnorm parameters ( @xmath44 for each of the sets 1 and 4 , and @xmath44 and @xmath51 for set 5 ) . with the @xmath43-adnorm method it drops to @xmath52 after introducing three @xmath43-adnorm parameters ( @xmath44 for each of the sets 1 , 4 , and 5 ) .",
    "the difference between the two adnorm methods is minor . in order to demonstrate this",
    ", we calculated the @xmath1(dif ) for the difference between the two differential cross sections obtained by the two adnorm methods .",
    "this @xmath1(dif ) is very low , only 0.8 for the total data set .",
    "the conclusion is that the large systematic errors of unknown origin present in the uppsala data can be corrected for by using one of the adnorm methods .",
    "the drop of about 150 in @xmath1 resulting from the introduction of only 3 @xmath43-adnorm ( or 4 @xmath41-adnorm ) parameters is impressive .    to present the data in a similar way as was done by the uppsala group  @xcite , we averaged the data in the overlap regions between the different sets .",
    "the difference @xmath53 normalized in the various ways discussed , is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . in the top panel",
    "we show the data normalized in the uppsala way and we get @xmath54 for the 54 data points . in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we show the data normalized in the standard angle - independent way .",
    "this leads to @xmath55 . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we present the data normalized with the @xmath41-adnorm method .",
    "we obtain then @xmath56 . from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] one clearly sees the difference between the various ways the data have been normalized , and the enormous improvement obtained with the adnorm method .",
    "another place where the angle - dependent normalization procedure works impressively is the abundant freiburg data  @xcite .",
    "this data set consists of 4 different measurements ( labeled expt i to expt iv ) of @xmath0 differential cross sections , each at 20 beam energies between @xmath57 and 580.0 mev , with a spacing of about 20 mev . because we compare with pwa93 we can only study data with energies less than 350 mev , _",
    "i.e. _ the 8 energies from 199.9 mev to 340.0 mev . because of their too high individual contribution to @xmath1 ( more than 3 s.d . )",
    "we remove from the database the four data points ( expt , @xmath58 , @xmath41 ) = ( ii , 261.9 mev , @xmath59 ) , ( ii , 300.2 mev , @xmath60 ) , ( ii , 340.0 mev , @xmath61 ) , and ( iii , 199.9 mev , @xmath62 ) . for the total freiburg data set we are left then with 859 data points .    in table",
    "[ tab:2 ] we present the @xmath63 values for these 4 experiments at 8 energies after the standard angle - independent normalization .",
    "it is clear that @xmath35 for most of these 32 data sets is much too high . for the total data set of 859 points we find @xmath64 , which is 32 s.d .",
    "higher than the expectation value @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , the total freiburg data set would normally be discarded in pwa s .",
    "however , we can try the adnorm method",
    ". the results of applying the @xmath41-adnorm method are presented in table  [ tab:3 ] .",
    "the first striking observation is the enormous drop in @xmath1 , from 2139 to 831 , for the 859 data points .",
    "this drop was achieved by introducing next to the original 32 normalizations @xmath30 also 45 @xmath41-adnorm parameters .",
    "this implies on the average a drop of no less than 29 per adnorm parameter .",
    "looking at the four experiments separately , one sees that expt i and expt iv have values for @xmath66 that are smaller than their expectation value ( @xmath67 s.d . and @xmath67 s.d . ) , that expt ii has a @xmath66 that is 0.6 s.d .",
    "higher than its expectation value , and that expt iii has a @xmath66 that is 3.3 s.d .",
    "higher than its expectation value .",
    "this , unfortunately , means that expt iii would have to be excluded from the database for pwa93 . for the remaining 647 points of expt i ,",
    "ii , and iv we expect @xmath68 .",
    "we get @xmath69 , which is an excellent result .",
    "we have checked explicitly that the @xmath1-distribution of the renormalized freiburg data is in very good agreement with the theoretical expectation  @xcite . with the @xmath43-adnorm method we got similar results . using 46 @xmath43-adnorm parameters and 32 normalizations we reached @xmath70= 832 for the 859 data points .",
    "also in this case expt iii should be omitted from the database for pwa s . in table  [ tab:3 ] we also present the values of the slope @xmath46 of the data at @xmath57 mev after applying the @xmath41-adnorm method with @xmath71 .",
    "the conclusion is that the freiburg data set , when compared to pwa93 using the adnorm method , has three statistically acceptable experiments and one , expt iii , that is statistically not acceptable .",
    "however , one must realize that if this expt iii were included in a new pwa , then it might possibly have a statistically acceptable value of @xmath1 .",
    "we would like to point out that also this expt iii can be saved , when we are willing to bend a little our rule for individual outliers . in the introduction we already pointed out that this has nothing to do with the adnorm method , but only with our wish not to discard data unless it is absolutely necessary .",
    "when for expt iii a 2.5 s.d",
    ". rule is used instead of a 3 s.d .",
    "rule , we must remove also the three data points ( iii , 199.9 mev , @xmath72 ) , ( iii , 240.2 mev , @xmath73 ) , and ( iii , 340.0 mev , @xmath74 ) as more than 2.5 s.d . outliers . in table",
    "[ tab:3 ] the most right column of expt iii contains the relevant information for this case . for the 209 data points left from expt iii we have the expectation value @xmath75 , and we find @xmath76 , which is 2.3 s.d .",
    "higher than expected . therefore , expt iii is now also statistically acceptable .",
    "the conclusion is that the four freiburg experiments , consisting of 856 datapoints , can be made statistically acceptable with the adnorm method and using the 2.5 s.d .",
    "rule for outliers .",
    "finally , we consider the princeton data  @xcite .",
    "this relatively old data set is generally not included in pwa s and these data were _",
    "e.g. _ also discarded in the final version of pwa93 .",
    "we can , however , revisit these data with the adnorm method .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab:4 ] .",
    "after we have removed two data points ( @xmath77 mev , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) as more than 3 s.d .",
    "outliers , the total set contains 156 data points , divided over 9 energies below @xmath80 mev .",
    "when we normalize these data in the standard manner we get @xmath81 .",
    "this is about 25 s.d .",
    "higher than the expectation value .",
    "next we applied the @xmath41-adnorm method .",
    "this required 14 additional adnorm parameters .",
    "the expectation value is then @xmath82 .",
    "we obtain @xmath83 , which is still 3.9 s.d . too high .",
    "therefore the princeton data , unfortunately , can not be saved by the adnorm method alone , despite the enormous improvement in @xmath1 from 582 to 195 , which amounts on the average to a drop of 28 per adnorm parameter . using the @xmath43-adnorm method",
    "gives similar results .",
    "however , when again we are willing to bend our rule for individual outliers a little , we can also save these data . according to the 2.5 s.d . rule the three data points ( @xmath58 , @xmath41 ) = ( 224 mev , @xmath84 ) , ( 239 mev , @xmath85 ) , and ( 257 mev , @xmath86 )",
    "must also be omitted .",
    "there are then 153 data points left , which leads to the expectation value @xmath87 .",
    "the second entries in table  [ tab:4 ] give the relevant information for this case .",
    "we obtain @xmath88 , which is 2.4 s.d .",
    "higher than expected .",
    "about the adnorm method that we proposed here , the question could be raised :  is it successful because it corrects for experimental errors , or perhaps because it corrects for unknown biases in the pwa s ? \" we claim that we correct for unknown systematic _ experimental _ errors . to demonstrate this we defined the slope parameter @xmath89 for the case @xmath71 .",
    "looking at the different problematic experiments in about the same angular region and at about the same energy , we note significant differences . in the backward direction",
    "@xmath90 $ ] there are several experiments at about the same energy .",
    "these are the uppsala set 5 at 162 mev , the freiburg expt s i and ii at 199.9 mev , and the princeton data at 182 mev .",
    "the values of @xmath91 are @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "these slopes do not agree !",
    "the disagreement between the uppsala sets 1 and 2 and the freiburg expt iv is worse .",
    "uppsala set 1 covers the angular region @xmath96 $ ] and has @xmath97 .",
    "uppsala set 2 covers @xmath98 $ ] and has @xmath99 .",
    "the freiburg expt iv covers @xmath100 $ ] and has @xmath101 , which is even of the _ opposite _ sign as the values for the uppsala sets 1 and 2 . when one wants to blame pwa93 for the discrepancy and claim that the uppsala and freiburg data are in agreement",
    ", then one should at least find the same values for @xmath46 . because the @xmath46 values for these experiments are significantly different",
    ", we can conclude that the uppsala and freiburg data are not in agreement with each other .",
    "it is then also clear that the discrepancies must be of experimental origin .    in conclusion , we have shown that many of the measurements of the @xmath0 differential cross section suffer from similar systematic errors .",
    "these errors are mostly so large that the corresponding data sets can not be included in pwa s .",
    "however , it turned out that these systematic errors have a smooth angular dependence , which can easily be parametrized .",
    "this allowed us then to use the adnorm method to correct for these systematic errors .",
    "in many cases this gave rise to impressive drops in the values of @xmath1 for several of the seriously flawed data sets .",
    "many of the data sets became statistically acceptable after application of the adnorm method and therefore can now be included in the data base for pwa s .",
    "however , some of the sets required also a slight change in the definition of outlier to make them acceptable . in this manner ,",
    "several @xmath0 data sets  @xcite can be saved from oblivion .",
