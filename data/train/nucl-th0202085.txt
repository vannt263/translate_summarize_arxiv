    "it has long been known that spectroscopy of doubly odd deformed nuclei evidences phenomena which can be directly associated with the interaction between the unpaired neutron and proton .",
    "the two most important effects of this kind are known as gallagher - moszkowski ( gm ) splitting @xcite and newby ( n ) shift @xcite .",
    "recently , use of large multi - detector @xmath6-ray arrays with high analyzing power has largely extended the amount of experimental data on this class of nuclei .",
    "for instance , currently available data in the rare - earth region allow the empirical determination of 137 gm splittings and 36 n shifts for 25 doubly odd nuclei @xcite .",
    "these are to be compared with the 50 gm splittings and 19 n shifts known in the mid 1970s , as reported in the extensive review article by boisson _",
    "the new experimental data have also evidenced the occurrence of other phenomena which may provide further information on the neutron - proton ( n - p ) interaction .",
    "of particular interest is the odd - even staggering in @xmath7 bands , the most important mechanism responsible for it being the direct coriolis coupling with one or more n - shifted @xmath4 bands @xcite . also to be mentioned is the signature inversion phenomenon , which in the last few years has attracted much attention leading to several experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "various attempts have been made to understand this phenomenon in term of different mechanisms , but its interpretation still remains an open question @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "( hereafter referred to as i ) we have studied the doubly odd deformed nucleus @xmath8lu by performing a complete coriolis band - mixing calculation within the framework of the particle - rotor model .",
    "we focused attention on the lowest @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands , where the effects of the residual n - p interaction are particularly evident producing a significant n shift in the former and an odd - even staggering in the latter .",
    "the aim of our study was in fact to investigate the role of the tensor force , which has long been a controversial matter .",
    "a detailed discussion on this point can be found in i. in that paper we have used for the n - p interaction both a finite - range force with a gaussian radial shape and a zero - range interaction . to completely explore the role of the tensor force , we have performed two different calculations with the gaussian potential , with and without the tensor terms , respectively .",
    "the main result of these calculations was that the tensor force is absolutely essential for the description of the above mentioned bands in @xmath8lu . in i",
    "we have also confirmed the relevance of exchange forces , which was already emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    ", we extend our calculations to other doubly odd deformed nuclei in the rare - earth region , focusing attention on n - shifted and odd - even staggered bands in @xmath0lu , @xmath1ta , @xmath2ta , and @xmath3re ( some preliminary results have already been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . the main motivation for this work is to verify if the conclusions based on the study of @xmath8lu are confirmed when considering a larger set of experimental data .",
    "in fact , the role of the tensor force in doubly odd deformed nuclei seems not yet completely recognized , as evidenced by the large number of recent calculations making use of zero - range forces ( see for example ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give a brief description of the model and some details of our calculations .",
    "our results are presented and compared with the experimental data in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv we draw the conclusions of our study .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , our calculations are performed within the framework of the particle - rotor model , in which the unpaired neutron and proton are strongly coupled to an axially symmetric core and interact through a residual effective interaction .",
    "this is a well known model and a detailed description can be found , for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we give in the following the most relevant formulas .",
    "the total hamiltonian is written as @xmath11 the term @xmath12 includes the rotational energy of the whole system , the deformed , axially symmetric field for the neutron and proton , and the one - body intrinsic contribution from the rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "it reads @xmath13.\\ ] ] the two terms @xmath14 and @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) stand for the coriolis coupling and the coupling of particle degrees of freedom through the rotational motion , respectively .",
    "their explicit expressions are @xmath16 and @xmath17 in eqs .",
    "( 2)-(4 ) , @xmath18 is the moment of inertia of the core while @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the total and intrinsic angular momentum operators , respectively .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are their projections on the intrinsic symmetry axis and , owing to the axial symmetry , are represented by the same quantum number @xmath23 .",
    "the effective n - p interaction in ( 1 ) has the general form @xmath24,\\ ] ] where the notation is just the same as that adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as basis states we use the eigenfunctions of @xmath12 , which are written as a symmetrized product of rotational functions @xmath25 and intrinsic wave functions @xmath26",
    "@xmath27 @xmath28 is the the quantum number corresponding to @xmath29 and @xmath30 stands for all the additional quantum numbers necessary to completely specify the states .",
    "the state @xmath31 is the time - reversal partner of @xmath32 .",
    "the quantum number @xmath23 has two possible values @xmath33 corresponding to parallel or anti - parallel coupling of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "each intrinsic state gives then rise to a rotational band , but the hamiltonian ( 1 ) produces an admixture of different bands .",
    "the explicit expressions of the matrix elements of the total hamiltonian can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it can be seen that while the coriolis interaction has only @xmath36 matrix elements , the two terms @xmath37 and @xmath38 give rise to diagonal and non - diagonal contributions . in particular , the latter has diagonal matrix elements different from zero only for @xmath4 bands with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , they have been generated by a standard nilsson potential as defined , for instance , in @xcite . in our calculations for the four nuclei @xmath0lu , @xmath1ta , @xmath2ta , and @xmath3re the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 in this potential have been fixed by using the mass - dependent formulas of ref .",
    "@xcite , while the harmonic oscillator parameter @xmath30 has been chosen according to the expression @xmath43 @xmath44 .",
    "the deformation parameter @xmath45 has been deduced for each doubly odd nucleus from the even - even neighbor . in table",
    "i , we report the values of @xmath45 together with those of the rotational parameter , @xmath46 , used in our calculations . for each doubly odd nucleus",
    "this latter quantity has been deduced from low - lying bands with a pure rotational character .",
    "the adopted single - particle schemes for the neutron and proton are listed in table ii for the four considered nuclei , each scheme being essentially derived from the experimental spectra of the two neighboring odd - mass nuclei .",
    "as regards the residual n - p interaction ( 5 ) , we have used a finite - range force with a radial dependence @xmath47 of the gaussian form @xmath48    as mentioned in the introduction , the main aim of this study is to assess the role of the tensor force . to this end , we have performed two different calculations with the gaussian potential , with and without the tensor terms , respectively . in both cases , for all the parameters of the force we have adopted the values determined by boisson _",
    "@xcite , the only exception being @xmath49 , which does not contribute either to the gm splttings or to the n shifts .",
    "these values , as well as that of @xmath49 , are reported in i , where the reasons of our choice are also discussed .    before closing this section",
    "it is worth mentioning that we have also performed calculations making use of a @xmath50 interaction with a strength of the spin - spin parameter varied over a large range of values .",
    "we have found that no value of this strength gives a satisfactory description of the n shifts and odd - even staggerings in any of the considered nuclei , thus confirming our results for @xmath8lu ( see i ) . as a consequence , here we will not compare with experiment the results obtained by using a @xmath50 force , but make only some comments to point out the inadequacy of this force to explain the above mentioned effects .",
    "we report here the results of our calculations for @xmath0lu , @xmath1ta , @xmath2ta , and @xmath3re , which are all well deformed nuclei .",
    "the choice of these nuclei is motivated by the fact that enough experimental information relevant to our study is available for them .",
    "in fact , in the experimental spectra of @xmath0lu , @xmath2ta , and @xmath3re @xmath4 bands , which are not strongly perturbed but have a sizeable n shift , have been recognized , while in @xmath1ta and @xmath3re there are @xmath5 bands which exhibit a significant odd - even staggering . we have focused attention on those data which are directly related to the n - p interaction , so as to give a sound answer to the question regarding the role of the tensor term .",
    "in fact , aside from the residual n - p interaction , also the terms @xmath38 and @xmath51 of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) may give a contribution to the odd - even shift ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and a complex interplay of all these interactions may occur in bands characterized by a strong admixture of different intrinsic wave functions . in these cases , even taking explicitly into account all contributions coming from hamiltonian ( 1 ) , it would be a very difficult task to disentangle the genuine effects of the n - p interaction .    in figs . 1 - 3 the experimental spectra of the @xmath4 bands",
    "@xcite are reported and compared with the calculated ones , which are obtained making use of the two different interactions mentioned in sec .",
    "ii . the @xmath52 @xmath53n\\frac{7}{2}[633]$ ]",
    "band of @xmath0lu starting at 281 kev excitation energy is shown in fig .",
    "this band , recognized in several other odd - odd nuclei , has been observed in @xmath0lu up to @xmath54 .",
    "we see that a very good agreement with experiment is obtained for the gaussian force with tensor terms .",
    "this is not the case for the calculations performed with the pure central interaction . from fig .",
    "1 it appears that the two calculations yield almost the same level spacings for states with even and odd angular momenta separately .",
    "the main difference between the two spectra resides in the energy displacement of levels of odd @xmath55 relative to those of even @xmath55 , i.e. the n shift . in first order perturbation theory",
    "the n shift is just defined as the matrix element latexmath:[$\\langle \\nu_{p } \\omega_{p } , \\nu_{n } \\overline{\\omega}_{n}|v_{np }    iii we report the values of this matrix element obtained with the central plus tensor force together with the individual contributions . for the above",
    "mentioned @xmath4 band in @xmath0lu we see that the magnitude of the matrix element is almost entirely determined by the tensor force , the central part giving only 1 kev contribution .",
    "this result is in line with the early findings of refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was evidenced the importance of the contribution of tensor force to the n shift for bands based on antiparallel or parallel intrinsic spins .",
    "for the latter the effects of the tensor part are predominant , as expected from the study of ref .",
    "@xcite , where an analysis in the asymptotic limit was performed . in this context",
    ", we should also mention that when using a @xmath50 force , as defined for instance in i , there is no reasonable way to reproduce the odd - even shift of this band .",
    "in fact , taking a negative value for the strength @xmath57 of the spin - spin term , the odd - even shift has the opposite sign as compared to the experimental one , its magnitude increasing almost linearly with @xmath57 . as an example , when using @xmath58 - 0.9 mev , which is a reasonable value to reproduce the gm splitting in the rare earth region @xcite , the matrix element latexmath:[$\\langle \\nu_{p } \\omega_{p } , \\nu_{n } \\overline{\\omega}_{n}|v_{np }    kev .",
    "the fact that a @xmath50 force produces a shift with the wrong sign while a pure central force gives a very small contribution , but with the right sign , makes evident the importance of the exchange forces .    in figs . 2 and 3 we compare the experimental and calculated spectra for two lowest @xmath4 bands in @xmath2ta and @xmath3re , respectively .",
    "the first is the @xmath60 @xmath53n\\frac{7}{2}[503]$ ] band with a bandhead energy at 558 kev while the second is the @xmath52 @xmath61n\\frac{9}{2}[505]$ ] band starting at 208 kev . unfortunately , only low - spin members of these two bands have been identified , but , as for @xmath0lu , an excellent agreement is obtained in both cases when a gaussian force with tensor terms is used . from figs . 2 and 3 we see that the right level order is obtained while the discrepancies in the energies are less than 20 kev for all the states .",
    "as regards the calculations with a pure central force , the situation is quite similar to that discussed for @xmath0lu .",
    "in fact , the disagreement between the experimental data and the results of these calculations resides in the relative displacement in the energy of the states with odd and even angular momentum , which , as mentioned before , is essentially due to n - p interaction . in table",
    "iii we report the values of the relevant matrix elements .",
    "we see again that the pure central force gives only a small contribution , the magnitude of these matrix elements being essentially determined by the tensor force .    to conclude this discussion",
    ", we have shown that the tensor force is quite able to explain the odd - even shift in @xmath4 bands of @xmath0lu , @xmath2ta and @xmath3re .",
    "we now compare in table iv the empirical gm splittings @xcite for these three nuclei with those derived from the calculated bandhead energies . in this table",
    "we only report the results obtained using the gaussian plus tensor force .",
    "this is to show how this force , parametrized as in ref .",
    "@xcite , leads to a very good description of the three nuclei @xmath0lu , @xmath2ta and @xmath3re on the whole .",
    "in fact , we see from table iv that not only is the sign correctly reproduced in all cases , also the quantitative agreement is quite satisfactory .",
    "the discrepancy between the calculated and experimental values is always less than 50 kev , except in one case where it turns out to be 101 kev . in this case , however , the empirical gm splitting is affected by an error of 57 kev .",
    "let us now come to the odd - even staggering effect . in fig .",
    "4 the experimental @xcite ratio @xmath62/2i$ ] for the @xmath63 n \\frac{9}{2 } [ 624 ] $ ] ground - state band in @xmath1ta is plotted vs @xmath55 and compared with the calculated ones . we see that this band exhibits a rather large odd - even staggering , the even @xmath55 states being energetically favored with respect to the odd ones .",
    "this behavior is satisfactorily reproduced by the calculation including the tensor force while with the pure central gaussian force the staggering is almost nonexistent .",
    "it should be pointed out that the staggering in this band may be traced to direct coriolis coupling with the @xmath64 n \\frac{7}{2 } [ 633 ] $ ] band .",
    "in fact , in both our calculations we have found that the wave functions of the states of the @xmath65 band contain significant components ( up to 30@xmath66 ) of states of the above @xmath67 band .",
    "the fact that only the calculation including the tensor terms gives the right staggering implies therefore that only this force is able to produce a sizeable n shift for this @xmath67 band .",
    "since this band has not been recognized in @xmath1ta , a direct comparison is not possible at the present time .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the @xmath67 band in @xmath0lu ( see fig .",
    "1 ) has just to the same intrinsic n - p configuration . as we have already pointed out above , only with the gaussian plus tensor force the energy of the even @xmath55 states of this band",
    "is decreased so as to bring the calculated spectrum in good agreement with the experimental one .    in fig .",
    "5 the experimental staggering observed in the @xmath68 n \\frac{3}{2 } [ 512 ] $ ] ground - state band of @xmath3re @xcite is compared with the calculated ones .",
    "although this band does not exhibit a large odd - even staggering , we see that only with the gaussian plus tensor force the calculated behavior reproduces the experimental one . also in this case",
    "the wave functions of the states of the @xmath69 band obtained from both calculations contain appreciable components ( 5 - 10 @xmath66 ) of states with @xmath70 n \\frac{5}{2 } [ 503 ] $ ] .",
    "the difference in the two calculations may therefore be traced back to the different values of the matrix element @xmath71 n \\overline{\\frac{5}{2 } } [ 503 ] | v_{np } | p \\overline{\\frac{5}{2 } } [ 402 ] n \\frac{5}{2 } [ 503 ] \\rangle $ ] .",
    "in fact , as can be seen from table iii , only the matrix element of the gaussian plus tensor force turns out to be adequate to produce a sizeable n shift for the @xmath72 band . unfortunately",
    ", this band has not been observed in @xmath3re or in other rare - earth nuclei .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the results of a study of the well deformed doubly odd nuclei @xmath0lu , @xmath1ta , @xmath2ta , and @xmath3re within the framework of the particle - rotor model .",
    "we have performed complete coriolis band - mixing calculations , focusing attention on the lowest @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands , where the effects of the neutron - proton interaction are particularly evident .",
    "as regards this interaction , we have used in our calculations a gaussian force with and without tensor terms adopting in both cases the values of the parameters originally determined by boisson _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "this study represents an extension of our previous work on @xmath8lu aimed at obtaining further insight into the role of the tensor force in the description of doubly odd deformed nuclei .",
    "the results presented here , as those reported in i , show that the tensor force is an essential ingredient , if not unique in some cases , to explain the odd - even shift in @xmath4 bands .",
    "also the staggering in @xmath7 bands , whose basic mechanism is the coriolis mixing with n - shifted @xmath4 bands , is very well accounted for by our calculations with tensor terms .",
    "it should be mentioned that in more complex situations , where there is a strong band mixing , other mechanisms may play a significant role and only the right interplay between them can explain the observed effects .",
    "this is , for instance , the case of the so called doubly decoupled bands , namely of bands based on high-@xmath73 unique - parity shell - model states .",
    "also in this context , however , the tensor force should not be neglected , as is done in most of the existing studies to date .",
    "the use of an incomplete neutron - proton interaction may in fact lead to an incorrect evaluation of the weight of other mechanisms .",
