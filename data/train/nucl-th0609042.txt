    "one of the major goals of high - energy heavy - ion research is to explore the properties of strongly interacting matter , particularly its phase structure @xcite .",
    "the regions of temperature and baryon density that can be accessed depend on the collision energy .",
    "thus systems with a very small net baryon density but rather high temperature are formed at rhic @xcite @xmath3 , while it is expected that the creation of the highest possible baryon densities would occur at more moderate collision energies ( @xmath4 @xcite ) , such as those becoming available at the planned fair @xcite or at the low - energy end of rhic .",
    "our understanding of the qcd phase diagram is best developed at vanishing chemical potential , @xmath5 , where lattice qcd calculations are most easily carried out .",
    "the most recent results indicate that the transformation from a low - entropy hadron resonance gas to a high - entropy quark - gluon plasma occurs smoothly as the temperature is raised , with no real phase transition being present @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , at zero temperature most models predict the occurrence of a first - order phase transition when the density is raised @xcite , though no firm results are yet available for the corresponding value of the chemical potential , @xmath6 .",
    "however , if the @xmath7 transformation is in fact of first order , one would expect the phase boundary to extend into the region of finite temperature and terminate at a certain critical endpoint , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent lattice qcd results @xcite suggest the presence of such a first - order phase transition line and an associated critical end - point , though its precise location is not yet determined .    the facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) under construction at gsi in germany will make it possible to create compressed baryonic matter in the laboratory , matter with a high net baryon density .",
    "the increasing interest in this physics area is underscored by the recent proposal for a low - energy campaign at rhic aimed at the identification of the critical point @xcite and by current discussions about the feasibility of searching for the mixed phase at the jinr nuclotron @xcite .    in order to assess the prospects for using these facilities to explore the phase structure it is important to know what",
    "thermodynamic environments are being generated in the bulk of the collision systems at the various bombarding energies available .",
    "for this purpose , we have employed a number of existing models to simulate central collisions of gold nuclei in the beam energy range anticipated at fair ( @xmath9 ) and then extracted key information about the bulk environments generated in the course of a collision .",
    "generally , the systems involved in a high - energy nuclear collision evolve rapidly in time and , furthermore , they are far from being uniform in space .",
    "the former feature prevents equilibrium from being fully established , while the latter feature invalidates the familiar thermodynamic relations which pertain to bulk matter . as a consequence ,",
    "dynamical simulation models are indispensable in the exploration of these processes .    however , within a given microscopic transport model",
    ", it is possible to extract the characteristics of the local environment at any point in space and time and on this basis ascertain the degree of local equilibrium achieved and extract the corresponding local characteristics .",
    "such a study was first made by dorso _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who calculated the breakup of an initially compressed and heated nucleus and extracted its thermodynamic phase evolution .",
    "this analysis showed that the bulk of the system entered the spinodal region associated with the first - order nuclear liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "furthermore , the resulting fragmentation pattern exhibited signs of filamentation , a general characteristic feature of spinodal phase decomposition .    as an instructive reference case for our present study",
    ", we consider central collisions of two gold nuclei and focus on the physical conditions at the center of the system .",
    "thus , in the cm frame , we consider only a small region around the origin , @xmath10 , and then seek to characterize the physical environment there as it evolves in the course of time .",
    "we are particularly interested in the net baryon density @xmath11 and the energy density @xmath12 .",
    "the local stress tensor is also of interest but will not be examined here .",
    "since we focus on the center of the system , there is no collective flow by symmetry .",
    "( while this is strictly true only on the average , each individual event might display some flow at the origin , but this possibility is unimportant and may be safely disregarded . )",
    "we do not wish to engage in a technical discussion of how these quantities can be extracted in the various models but refer the reader to the relevant literature cited for each particular model .",
    "we only note here that in numerical treatments that employ a grid in position space , such as fluid dynamics , these values can simply be read off at the appropriate lattice site ( the origin , in the present case ) , while methods that represent the dynamical state of the system in terms of individual ( test ) particles must resort to an average over a suitably small test volume @xmath13 around the origin .",
    "[ due to the strong lorentz contraction early on , the test volume must initially be sufficiently thin ; a typical choice would be @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the lorentz factor associated with the initial nuclear motion in the cm frame . on the other hand , as the longitudinal expansion progresses and the system grows increasingly dilute , it may improve the sampling statistics to stretch the test box . ]",
    "it is important to note that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 have well - defined values at all times . in particular",
    ", their extraction does not require that local thermal equilibration has been reached .",
    "this is one advantage of considering these particular observables for the present study .",
    "however , of course , their thermodynamic relevance does depend on the degree of local equilibration achieved , as reflected principally in the isotropy of the pressure tensor .    in each individual model",
    ", it may be possible to also extract local thermodynamic quantities , such as temperature @xmath16 , chemical potential @xmath17 , or entropy density @xmath18 , but although most extraction methods can be cast in sufficiently general terms to make them applicable also to non - equilibrium scenarios , those quantities have physical meaning only in equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , importantly , even if equilibrium is reached , identical values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 will generally lead to different values for those thermodynamic quantities from one model to the other , due to their differences in mean fields and degrees of freedom .",
    "by contrast , the mechanical quantities @xmath0 and @xmath1 are inherently more robust variables since they are subject to local conservation laws .",
    "for example , in ideal fluid dynamics the conservation of four - momentum is expressed as @xmath19 , while the conservation of baryon charge is expressed by the continuity equation @xmath20 .",
    "since the various dynamical models generally abide by these basic conservation laws , they will have a tendency to yield similar results for the corresponding quantities . by asking about the behavior of such conserved observables",
    "we may therefore expect to obtain relatively robust answers .",
    "[ of course , for the purpose of discriminating between models ( which is _ not _ our purpose here ) , it would probably be better to consider observables that are more sensitive to the specific model ingredients . ]    to further underscore the qualitative difference between `` mechanical '' or `` dynamical '' quantities such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 and `` thermodynamical '' quantities such as @xmath17 and @xmath16 , we note that the above - mentioned conservation laws guarantee that the local energy or ( baryon ) charge density can not change without the occurrence of a suitable amount of energy or charge transport , which requires some time .",
    "by contrast , there are no such conservation laws restricting the rate of change of the local temperature or entropy or chemical potential , which can change essentially instantaneously as a result of local reaction processes , such as ionization or chemical bonding .",
    "[ while such phenomena may well offer useful signals of the hadronization phase transition ( which can be viewed as some sort of bonding ) , they are not of interest for the present study . ]    a further advantage of considering the variables @xmath1 and @xmath0 rather than @xmath16 and @xmath17 is that the equation of state , _",
    "i.e. _  the pressure @xmath21 is then always a single - valued function while this is not always the case for @xmath22 . indeed , precisely when a first - order phase transition is present , the bulk pressure ( _ i.e. _  the pressure of a spatially uniform system ) , @xmath22 , is multi - valued throughout the region of phase coexistence . because of this feature , if the phase trajectory were represented as @xmath23 , it would exhibit a rather complex behavior as the expansion drives the system through the phase coexistence region , thus complicating the analysis considerably .",
    "this problem is not encountered in the @xmath24 representation , where the phase trajectory has a regular behavior throughout .",

    "we use the hadronic chiral flavor - su(3 ) model @xcite .",
    "this model is based on a chiral hadronic su(3 ) lagrangian that incorporates and couples the complete set of baryons from the lowest flavor - su(3 ) octet , the entire multiplets of scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , and axial vector mesons , as well as baryon resonance states @xcite .",
    "these hadrons have various types of interaction that endow them with effective masses and induce spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking as well as scale breaking via a dilaton field .",
    "the parameters of the model are fixed by symmetry considerations , hadronic vacuum observables , or nuclear matter saturation properties .",
    "the model provides a satisfactory description of both finite nuclei and neutron stars @xcite and , furthermore , it has been used for fluid - dynamical studies of the space - time evolution and hbt radii in relativistic nuclear collisions @xcite .    with the baryon resonance couplings chosen suitably ,",

    "( but it is seen to differ quantitatively from the schematic reference boundary discussed above - a useful reminder of that fact that the phase boundary is still rather poorly understood . ) furthermore , phase trajectories that are consistent with the phase diagram of the model can be obtained by performing adiabatic expansions .",
    "such expansions conserve the entropy per net baryon and that condition in turn yields a unique trajectory in the @xmath26 phase plane , once the initial phase point @xmath29 has been specified .    a simple but rough estimate of the initial conditions can be obtained by assuming that the very early dynamics is dominated by the interpenetration of the two lorentz - contracted nuclei .",
    "then the early baryon density ( in the cm frame ) is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the normal nuclear saturation density present in the nuclear interior and @xmath15 is the lorentz factor of the nuclei in the cm frame , @xmath32 , where @xmath27 is the beam kinetic energy per nucleon for a stationary target . in the cm ,",

    "these comparisons are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : comp ] for the beam energies @xmath81 .",
    "first of all , we note that by and large there is a remarkable degree of agreement between the results of the different models .",
    "the most notable exception is the qgsm expansion paths which come out significantly lower than those of the other models , as we have already discussed in sect .",
    "[ qgsm ] .",
    "for the subsequent discussion , in order to make a concrete analysis possible , we take the adopted reference phase boundary at face value .",
    "but it is important to keep in mind that this particular boundary , though not inconsistent with any information we presently have , is likely to be quantitatively inaccurate .",
    "however , its qualitative form is expected to be correct and our comments below are therefore expected to be robust , provided that appropriate adjustments are made in the specific energy values mentioned .    at the lowest beam energies ( under @xmath44 or so with the adopted phase boundary ) ,",
    "the degree of compression and agitation attained does not suffice to bring the central part of the system into the phase coexistence region and such collisions are not likely to have a bearing on the possible existence of a phase transition .",
    "however , due to their relative slowness , these collisions achieve of high degree of local equilibrium and the data obtained in this range may well provide quantitative information on the equation of state at the corresponding moderate compressions .",
    "above those `` subthreshold '' energies follows a range of beam energies ( approximately @xmath82 for the adopted reference phase boundary ) , within which the highest degree of compression occurs within the region of phase coexistence .",
    "as the beam energy is increased through this range , the turning point of the phase trajectory moves across the coexistence region , starting at the hadronic phase coexistence boundary and ending at the plasma boundary .",
    "though somewhat more violent , these trajectories are generally expected to still attain a high degree of local equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , importantly , they spend the longest period of time within the phase coexistence region . therefore",
    ", this energy range appears to be especially well suited for generating signals of the phase transition .",
    "as the collision energy is increased further , the turning point of the phase trajectory moves further inside the plasma region and , at the same time , the expansion path steepens .",
    "the time spent crossing the phase coexistence region then decreases , both in absolute terms and relative to the overall expansion time , so one would expect any phase - transition signals to gradually subside .    ultimately , beyond a certain critical collision energy ( for which the expansion phase trajectory passes straight through the critical point ) , the phase trajectory never enters the coexistence region but passes entirely to the left of the critical point .",
    "though interesting in its own right , this super - critical region of collision energy would not be expected to elucidate the character of the deconfinement phase transformation , _ i.e. _  to help determine whether there is in fact a first - order transition at sufficiently high baryon density .",
    "we also note that the adiabatic expansion results obtained with the su(3 ) model correspond approximately to the backtracking of the very early ( and mostly non - equilibrium ) dynamics when the two lorentz - contracted nuclear densities are being forced to interpenetrate .",
    "this feature mostly reflects the fact that the adopted initial values were taken to reflect such a scenario .",
    "if suitably modified initial conditions were chosen , for example obtained from the turning point of a dynamical trajectory , then the resulting expansion path would exhibit a large degree of resemblance with the corresponding dynamical trajectory .",
    "thus one may characterize the actual dynamical expansions as being approximately adiabatic .    finally , we wish to emphasize that none of the dynamical models employed ( except possibly phsd ) incorporate a first - order phase transition",
    ". they would therefore not be suitable , in their present form , for studying actual dynamical consequences of a phase transition . however , the presence of such a phase transition is not expected to have an overwhelming effect on the gross dynamics , primarily due to the predominance of the overall expansion .",
    "[ this expectation is supported by comparisons between hsd ( which does not contain a partonic phase ) and phsd ( which does have a partonic phase ) in the energy range considered here .",
    "] therefore , it must also be expected that the effects of a phase transition would be relatively subtle and might best be studied with carefully designed correlation observables .",
    "the present study has sought to elucidate the bulk conditions that may be expected to occur in nuclear collisions in the energy range where a possible first - order hadronization phase transition would be encountered . for this",
    "we have employed a number of existing dynamical models to central au+au collisions and extracted the time evolution of net baryon density @xmath0 and the energy density @xmath1 at the center of the system where these are expected to achieve their largest values .",
    "the different models exhibit a large degree of mutual agreement on the behavior of the corresponding phase trajectories @xmath24 , as was summarized in fig .",
    "[ f : comp ] , even if they differ substantially in other regards .",
    "a central issue in the physics of strongly interacting matter is whether the hadronization phase transformation is of first order at sufficiently high baryon density .",
    "the calculation of the corresponding critical point , and the associated phase boundary , poses a significant theoretical challenge and the question may ultimately have to be settled by experiment .",
    "the experimental investigation of this question may employ conceptually different strategies .",
    "one strategy searches for the critical point by means of special signals that may occur if the phase trajectory reaches its vicinity .",
    "however , the location of the critical point remains theoretically poorly understood and , as is well illustrated by fig .",
    "[ f : comp ] , a small shift in its position would require a relatively large change in the collision energy of the critical phase trajectory that passes through it .",
    "consequently , it is hard to predict what energy range would be most suitable for this approach . indeed , our present studies can not rule out that the critical collision energy lies somewhere in the sps range above the energies reachable by the planned fair .",
    "a different experimental strategy seeks direct evidence of the first - order transition by concentrating on signals that might appear as a result of the phase trajectory encountering the phase - transition line .",
    "one would expect that such signals would best be generated if the bulk of the system were brought well inside the phase coexistence region , where a phase decomposition is favored , and kept there for a time sufficient to allow the development of the macroscopic non - uniformities associated with the phase decomposition .",
    "though also associated with significant uncertainties , this issue can probably be assessed with somewhat larger confidence .",
    "thus , considering the large degree of mutual agreement between the different dynamical results and taking first the adopted schematic phase boundary at face value , the present study suggest that the optimal beam energy is around @xmath45 , corresponding to @xmath83 for a collider .",
    "we must , however , make allowance for the fact that the adopted schematic phase boundary is not expected to be quantitatively accurate",
    ". furthermore , the dynamical models , though yielding fairly similar results , may all possess common inaccuracies . with a factor of two admitted to account for such uncertainties",
    ", the present study would then suggest that the optimal conditions for exploring the hadronization phase transition are likely ( though not certain ) to occur for beam kinetic energies of @xmath84 , corresponding to @xmath85 for a collider .",
    "these numbers suggest that the planned fair at gsi is well matched for such studies .",
    "furthermore , this region may also be accessible at the low - energy end of rhic at bnl , as well as at a possible upgraded nuclotron at jinr in dubna .",
    "of course , further dynamical studies are required before it is possible to identify the specific candidate signals and to assess whether they can indeed be expected to develop sufficiently even at the optimal collision energy .",
    "we hope that this study will provide stimulation in this regard .",
