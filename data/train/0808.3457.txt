    "it is well - known that one can extract information on the space - time dimensions of the particle emission source ( the region of homogeneity ) in heavy - ion collisions ( hics ) by using the hanbury - brown - twiss interferometry ( hbt ) @xcite techniques . with the ongoing advances in detectors and accelerators",
    "one is able to explore collision energies for hics from less than @xmath2  gev ( sis / fair energy regime ) , @xmath3  gev ( fair / ags and sps ) up to @xmath4 gev ( rhic ) . within this broad energy region quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "predicts a transition from a hadron gas to a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , and it is expected that this new qgp state of matter exists at least temporarily in the center of hics . during the phase transition ( i.e. , in the mixed phase ) , it was proposed that a nontrivial transition in the spatio - temporal characteristics of the source exists @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , so far the excitation functions of the hbt parameters have not shown any _ obvious _ discontinuities in experiments with energies from sis , ags , sps , up to rhic @xcite . instead , several unexpected and interesting phenomena occurred , namely , the `` e - puzzle '' , the `` t - puzzle '' , and the `` non - gaussian '' effect @xcite ( for an explanation of these terms , see below ) .",
    "objectively speaking , the existing theoretical investigations are still in - sufficient and further thorough investigations are needed .    in a recent work on the hbt correlation , adopting the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd , v2.2 ) transport model @xcite and the `` correlation after - burner '' ( crab , v3.0@xmath5 ) analyzing program @xcite , the transverse momentum , system - size , centrality , and rapidity dependence of the hbt parameters of the sources of different identical particle pairs ( two @xmath6s , two @xmath7s , and two @xmath8s ) at ags , sps and rhic energies @xcite were investigated .",
    "it was found that although the calculations are generally in line with the experimental data , discrepancies are not negligible .",
    "one of the most puzzling phenomena is that the calculated ratio of hbt radii in the outward direction ( @xmath9 ) and in sideward direction ( @xmath10 ) from central hics is always larger than that extracted from the data at all investigated energies , if the cascade mode is employed , which was named as the hbt time - related puzzle ( `` hbt t - puzzle '' ) @xcite . after considering a soft equation of state ( eos ) with momentum dependence ( dubbed as sm - eos ) for formed baryons and a simple skyrme - like ( density dependent ) potential for the `` pre - formed '' particles @xcite ,",
    "the hbt radius @xmath9 is pushed down and the @xmath10 is pulled up to approach the data so that the `` hbt t - puzzle '' disappears throughout the whole energy region . meanwhile ,",
    "the transverse mass ( @xmath11 ) scaling , which was predicted in ref.@xcite , and has been probed by several experiments recently @xcite , can also be much better understood with the help of `` pre - formed '' particle potentials in hics @xcite .",
    "therefore , it was concluded that the interaction ( here it is embodied with potentials ) of particles at the early stages of hics can help to solve the `` hbt t - puzzle '' .",
    "however , besides the potential effects , the resonance dynamics and decay may also influence the momentum distribution of emitted particles as well as their correlation @xcite .",
    "since this question has been left aside in our previous works , in this paper , we want to complete the discussion by investigating the effects of the handling of resonance decay times on the hbt quantities by adopting the microscopically transport model urqmd .",
    "the different contributions from the resonance decay and from the potential modification are then compared . in order to have a clearer situation , in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the low energy region , i.e. , the fair / ags energy regime . in this energy region",
    "hadronic interactions dominate the dynamics .",
    "string dynamics is negligible and the quarks are still confined and the interactions between them do not need to be taken into account during the hics .",
    "a further simplification is that the available resonances at these beam energies are mainly the @xmath12s , and one can restrict the analysis of resonance modification to this hadron . due to the fact that pions have the largest abundance , they are well suited for the present analysis . negatively charged pions can be easily measured ( no contamination from misidentified k@xmath13s and protons ) and experimental data are therefore available from most experiments today .",
    "thus , we focus the present analysis on negatively charged pions .    the paper is arranged as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the urqmd transport model and the crab analyzing program are introduced .",
    "the different treatments of @xmath14 decay and the effects on pion production are also discussed . in section 3 , firstly , the gaussian fitting to the one- and the three - dimensional correlation functions of negatively charged pions and the non - gaussian effect are explored and discussed .",
    "secondly , we show the comparison of the transverse momentum dependence of hbt radii and @xmath1 ratios ( from the gaussian fitting ) between calculations with different treatments of the resonance decay and with(without ) mean field potentials and experimental data at ags energies .",
    "finally , in section 4 , a summary and outlook is given .",
    "the first formal version ( ver1.0 ) of the urqmd transport model was published in the end of last century @xcite . since then , a large number of successful theoretical analyses , predictions , and comparisons with data based on this transport model have been accomplished for _ pp _ , _ p_a and aa reactions for a large range of beam energies , i.e. , from sis , ags , sps , up to rhic @xcite .    the urqmd model is based on analogous principles as the quantum molecular dynamics model ( qmd ) @xcite and the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics model ( rqmd ) @xcite . similar to qmd ,",
    "hadrons are represented by gaussian wave packets in phase space , and the phase space of hadron @xmath15 is propagated according to hamilton s equation of motion :    @xmath16    here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the coordinate and momentum of hadron @xmath15 .",

    "recently , in order to be more successfully applied into the intermediate energy region ( @xmath29a gev ) , the urqmd has contained more potential terms @xcite , those are , 1 ) the density - dependent symmetry potential , which is essential for isospin - asymmetric reactions at intermediate and low energies , and 2 ) the momentum - dependent term @xcite @xmath30\\rho_i/\\rho_0 , \\label{umd}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are parameters , @xmath33 is the normal density .",

    "further , it was also found that the experimental pion and proton directed and elliptic flows from hics with beam energies from @xmath36a mev to @xmath37a gev can be well described @xcite .    at higher beam energies ,",
    "the yukawa- , pauli- , and symmetry- potentials of baryons becomes negligible , while the skyrme- and the momentum - dependent part of potentials still influence the whole dynamical process of hics . with the help of a covariant prescription of mean field from rqmd / s @xcite ,",
    "the effects of the mean field with momentum dependence on collective flows from hics at 2 - 158a gev energies were studied by a jet aa microscopic transportation model ( jam ) and it has been found that the momentum dependence in the nuclear mean field is important for the understanding of the proton collective flows at ags and even at sps energies @xcite . in this work , we choose the same sm - eos as that in ref .",

    "<S> hbt correlations of @xmath0 pairs at fair / ags energies are investigated by using the urqmd transport model and the crab analyzing program . </S>",
    "<S> three different possible sources ( treatment of resonance lifetimes , a soft equation of state and non - gaussian effects ) to understand the hbt @xmath1 puzzle are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we find that different treatments of the resonance decay time can not resolve the hbt time - related puzzle , however it can modify the hbt radii at low transverse momenta to some extent to explain the data slightly . secondly , with a soft equation of state with momentum dependence , the measured transverse momentum dependent hbt radii and @xmath1 ratio can be described fairly well . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , non - gaussian effects are visible in the calculated correlation function . using the edgeworth expansion </S>",
    "<S> , one finds that the non - gaussian effect is strongest in the longitudinal direction and weakest in the sideward direction .    </S>",
