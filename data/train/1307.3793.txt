    "`` water fountain '' sources ( wfs ) are asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) or post - agb stars that host highly - collimated , fast ( @xmath850 ) , bipolar jets traced by 22.2  ghz 2o  maser emission .",
    "interestingly , all of the observed dynamical ages of the wf jets are less than 100  yr . as of 2013 , 15 sources have been identified as possible wfs ( in more detail , see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is expected that they are signposts of the transition phase from the agb to post - agb , when one can see ignition of a stellar jet and a resulting metamorphosis from spherically symmetric to asymmetric structure of the circumstellar envelope ( cse ) .",
    "here we focus our interest on some wfs , in which 2o  masers near the dynamical centers of the jets show lower expansion velocities , roughly equal to a typical expansion velocity of a cse in the agb phase ( @xmath930 ) , and exhibit spherical symmetric distributions .",
    "the spherical expansion in such an expansion velocity is well traced in agb cses by 1612  mhz oh maser emission ( see , e.g. , the stellar oh maser data base , @xcite ) .",
    "they are a completely different component from the collimated wf jet whose velocity often exceeds 100  ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for these interesting wfs",
    ", it is considered that they still host relic cses made at the end of the agb phase because the majority of wfs are strongly obscured in the near - infrared bands ( e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is also considered that the stellar mass loss rate in the agb phase will increase over @xmath10 or much higher @xcite .",
    "a wf likely appears when the mass loss rate of the agb cse reaches its maximum , but what will happen to the cse soon after this phase ?",
    "thus , the exploration of the inner part of cses , including the oh and low - velocity 2o  masers , is important for identifying the stellar evolutionary phase through diagnosing the kinematics of such stellar mass loss .",
    "eventually , the study of the wfs will provide important clues to understanding the mechanisms of stellar jet launching and planetary nebula shaping in terms of the agb to post - agb transition .    in this paper , we present the spatiokinematics of 2o  masers and their spatial relationship with the 1612  mhz oh maser emission associated with 1846 ( hereafter abbreviated as i18460 ) , as revealed by observations with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) and the european vlbi network ( evn ) .",
    "the preliminary results were reported by @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we describe the results in more detail .",
    "this paper also presents additional data of the i18460 2o  masers that were used for determining the secular proper motion of i18460 .",
    "i18460 was first identified as a wf by @xcite .",
    "the 2o  maser spectrum showed a very large velocity separation of @xmath0290 , centered at the local - standard - of - rest ( lsr ) velocity of @xmath5100 .",
    "it also showed the systemic velocity component , whose velocity ( @xmath5120 ) coincides with that of the intrinsic co emission of i18460 @xcite and the center velocity of the double - peaked spectrum of oh masers @xcite .",
    "such a systemic velocity component of 2o  maser emission has sometimes been observed in the archetypal wf source , w43a @xcite .",
    "it has been unclear with what that component is associated , candidates are either a _ relic _ agb cse as defined above or an `` equatorial '' flow .",
    "the latter has an expansion velocity ( @xmath11 ) higher than that of the former ( @xmath121020 ) .",
    "the existence of an equatorial flow in a wf was recognized in the spatiokinematical structure of sio masers in w43a ( @xcite ( see also the case of iras  16342@xmath133814 , @xcite ) ) , but its origin is still obscure because of limited data from such flows . in iras  18286@xmath130959 ,",
    "paper ii also recognized the existence of a similar flow , but 2o  maser features associated with the flow were considered as  outliers \" of the collimated jet , which show proper motions much slower than those in the jet . in the case of i18460 , we revealed the spatiokinematics of 2o  masers in the systemic velocity components in detail for the first time in wfs . in this paper , we adopt a distance to i18460 of @xmath142  kpc ( see section [ sec : center ] ) , which is considerably less than the kinematic distance derived by assuming a circular orbit in the milky way ( 6.0 or 7.8  kpc ) .",
    "section [ sec : observations ] describes the vlba and evn observations of the 2o  and oh masers in i18460 , respectively , including normal maser source mapping and phase - referencing astrometric procedures .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents the 2o and oh maser maps and the results of astrometry .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] discusses the slowly expanding flow of i18460 , whose spatiokinematical structure is clearly elucidated , and the secular motion of i18460 in the milky way , which may provide an important clue to revealing the character of the central star in i18460 .",
    "we describe the vlba and evn observations ( project codes bi033 and ei009 , respectively ) and the analyses of their data , which follow the same procedure as those in paper ii .",
    "we also describe the astrometry of the 2o masers conducted in other vlba observations ( bi036 ) .",
    "table [ tab : status ] summarizes the status of the vlba observations and data reduction of the i18460 2o  masers .",
    "vlba observations were conducted three times during 2006 september2007 february ( bi033 ) and three times during 2008 september2009 february ( bi036 ) . in the first set of observations , another 2o  maser source iras  18286@xmath130959",
    "was also observed at the same time @xcite ( hereafter paper ii ) , therefore the on - source time for i18460 was limited to 3  hr . in the second set of observations , the antenna - nodding ,",
    "phase - referencing technique was employed for astrometry of the i18460 2o  masers , in which the maser and the phase - reference source j185146.7@xmath15003532 ( hereafter abbreviated as j1851 , 2@xmath16.52 away from i18460 ) were observed in a source - switching cycle of one minute . in all of the six sessions",
    ", the continuum source ot  081 was also observed for 4 minutes in every 20 minutes for calibration of group - delay residuals and bandpass characteristics .",
    "the received signals were recorded at a rate of 128  mbits  s@xmath17 with 2 bit quantization into eight base - band channels ( bbcs ) in dual circular polarization .",
    "the centers of four pairs of bbcs , each of which has a bandwidth of 4  mhz , were set to lsr velocities of @xmath1355 , 0 , 120 , and 240 .",
    "the recorded data were correlated with the socorro fx correlator using an integration period of 2  s. the data of each bbc was divided into 256 spectral channels , yielding a velocity spacing of 0.21  per spectral channel .",
    "the following coordinates were adopted as the delay - tracking centers in the data correlation :    @xmath1818@xmath1948@xmath2042@xmath21.94 , @xmath22  @xmath1301@xmath1648@xmath233028 and    @xmath1818@xmath1948@xmath2043@xmath21.027 , @xmath22  @xmath1301@xmath1648@xmath233046 for i18460 for the first and second sets of three sessions , respectively , and    @xmath1818@xmath1951@xmath2046@xmath21.723080 , @xmath22  @xmath1500@xmath1635@xmath233236283 for j1851 .    for the data reduction , we used the nrao s aips package and employed a normal procedure .",
    "after calibration of group - delay residuals and bandpass characteristics using scans on ot  081 , fringe fitting and self - calibration were made using a spectral channel that contained bright maser emission .",
    "column 3 in table [ tab : status ] gives the lsr velocity of the spectral channel selected as phase- and position - reference .",
    "the obtained solutions of calibration were applied to the data in all spectral channels .",
    "finally , image cubes of the maser source were synthesized in visibility deconvolution through the clean algorithm . because most of the 2o  maser spots ( velocity components ) were spatially partially resolved , calibration solutions and the associated visibilities were missing from relatively long baselines ( @xmath24 ) in the image synthesis . as a result , naturally weighted visibilities associated with available self - calibration solutions yielded a typical synthesized beam of 1.5  mas@xmath251.0  mas .",
    "columns 4 and 5 of table [ tab : status ] give values of the 1 @xmath26 noise level and the synthesized beam pattern , respectively .    in each spectral channel of the synthesized image cube , using a pops pipeline script including the aips task sad , brightness peaks higher than 7 @xmath26 noise level were identified as _ maser spots _ and their parameters as gaussian brightness components were extracted .",
    "we determined the position of a _ maser feature _ , which is a physical maser clump consisting of a cluster of maser spots seen in consecutive velocity components and at almost the same position within the synthesized beam , as described in @xcite .",
    "the peak - brightness velocity of a feature was determined by quadratic fitting of the peak intensities of the brightest three spots in the feature , then the position of the corresponding peak velocity was determined from linear interpolation of the positions of the two brightest spots .    for the astrometry of the i18460 2o masers , in the sessions of 20082009",
    ", all phase calibration steps were made using the data of j1851 , the solutions were then applied to the data of i18460 . because the calibration of unknown zenith delay residuals was imperfect and i18460",
    "is very close to the celestial equator , the synthesized maser source images were partially defocused , especially in the north  south direction . however , the obtained position accuracy of the 2o  masers ( @xmath140.1  mas and @xmath140.5  mas in the right ascension ( r.a . ) and declination directions ( decl . ) , respectively ) is sufficient to measure the linear proper motions of the masers and to compare their coordinates with those of the oh masers . for measurement of _",
    "relative _ maser proper motions , we used the image cube obtained from the astrometric analysis rather than that from the self - calibration scheme mentioned above .",
    "the evn observation of the i18460 oh masers ( @xmath27 @xmath28 at 1.612231f  ghz ) ( project code ei009b ) was conducted on 2007 june 11 using the following telescopes : lovell 76  m in jodrell bank , cambridge 32  m , westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( 14 25-m ) , medicina 32  m , noto 32  m , effelsberg 100  m , onsala 25  m , torun 32  m , and hartebeesthoek 26  m. we used the antenna - nodding phase - referencing technique ( e.g. , @xcite ) to obtain astrometric measurements for the maser source .",
    "this was possible for every telescope except the lovell 76  m , which always observed i18460 without antenna nodding .",
    "i18460 and the phase - reference continuum emission source j183307.8@xmath15013511 ( hereafter abbreviated as j1833 ) were scanned in a source - switching cycle of 5  minutes , resulting in the total duration of scans on i18460 being @xmath143  hr .",
    "j183243.5@xmath15135744 was observed for 3 minutes in every 40 minutes for calibration of group - delay residuals and bandpass characteristics .",
    "the received signals were recorded at a rate of 128  mbits  s@xmath17 with 2 bit quantization into eight bbcs in dual circular polarization .",
    "one pair of bbcs had a bandwidth of 1  mhz and others have 4  mhz for observing the i18460 2o  maser and the j1833 continuum emission , respectively .",
    "the recorded data were correlated with the mark iv processor in the joint institute for vlbi in europe using an integration period of 4  s. the data of each bbc was divided into 512 and 32 spectral channels , respectively , for the maser and continuum observations .",
    "a velocity channel spacing of 0.36  was obtained for the maser data .",
    "the coordinates of i18460 adopted in the data correlation were the same as the first set of the coordinates for the vlba data ( section [ sec : vlba ] ) .",
    "the following coordinates for j1833 were used in the data correlation :    @xmath1818@xmath1933@xmath2007@xmath21.760875 ,    @xmath22  @xmath1501@xmath1615@xmath233530098 .    in the analysis of the evn data , in addition to the standard calibration procedures as described in section [ sec : vlba ] , calibration of residual delays due to the ionosphere",
    "was also applied using the aips task tecor .",
    "fringe fitting and self - calibration were carried out as done for our vlba observations but using the data of j183243.5@xmath15135744 .",
    "phase referencing , fringe fitting and self - calibration were undertaken using the data of j1833 .",
    "the calibration solutions were applied to the data of i18460 .",
    "the image of j1833 and the image cube of the oh maser source were synthesized in visibility deconvolution through the clean algorithm .",
    "calibration solutions and their associated visibilities were lost from long baselines ( @xmath29 ) on j1833 , which has an extended structure ; this resulted in a large beam size for the image synthesis of the oh maser source . through the phase - referencing technique , we synthesized a maser image cube ( referred to as the phase - referencing - based cube ) and determined the absolute coordinates of the oh maser source .",
    "in addition , in order to obtain a higher angular resolution image cube of the oh maser source , free from the effects of the extended structure of j1833 , fringe fitting and self - calibration were also carried out using the oh maser data .",
    "the spectral channel at @xmath6111.7  was used as phase reference .",
    "the uniformly weighted visibilities yielded a synthesized beam of 97  mas@xmath2523  mas at a p.a.@xmath6 11 .",
    "thus we generated another maser image cube ( referred to as the self - calibration - based cube ) .",
    "the oh masers were also spatially resolved on baselines to the hartebeesthoek station , causing the elongated beam pattern in the north  south direction .",
    "tables [ tab : features_h2o_a ] and [ tab : features_h2o_b ] give the parameters of 2o  maser features detected in the observation sessions in 20062007 and 20082009 , respectively . in table",
    "[ tab : features_h2o_b ] , the positions are given as offsets with respect to the phase - tracking center of i18460 .",
    "with lsr velocity and proper motion measurements , the three - dimensional spatiokinematics of the 2o  masers has been revealed .",
    "table [ tab : pmotions ] gives the list of _ relative _ proper motions of 2o  maser features found in all observations .",
    "note that the position - reference maser features 1846:i2013 _ 6 _ and _ 19 _ have similar lsr velocities but are unlikely the same maser feature .",
    "they were observed at different epochs and likely located around the eastern and southern parts of the center maser region , respectively .",
    "it is difficult to find the same feature detected in both of the first three epochs ( 20062007 ) and the last three epochs ( 20082009 ) .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to combine the proper motion data obtained from the 20062007 season with those from the l20082009 season .",
    "nevertheless , we hereafter analyze the two sets of proper motions independently while checking their mutual consistency in the maser distributions and the kinematics .",
    "the 2o  masers clearly exhibit both a highly collimated bipolar jet in the north  south direction ( see section [ sec : jet ] ) and a central cluster of maser features ( hereafter the central components , see section [ sec : center ] ) .",
    "the latter masers have lsr velocities within 10  of the systemic velocity , which we adopt as @xmath6124.7  @xcite in this paper . using the astrometric data obtained during 2008 september2009 february , the absolute coordinates of the 2o  masers in the central components and the secular stellar proper motion were derived ( see section [ sec : secular - motion ] ) . using the same data , an annual parallax of the 2o  masers was tentatively detected .",
    "the oh masers show a double - peaked spectrum with a velocity separation of @xmath525(@xmath6111114 and 136140  in the phase - referencing - based cube and @xmath6111116 and 139140  in the self - calibration - based cube ) , which is typical of that seen in other agb stars .",
    "figure [ fig : oh - spectrum ] shows the cross - power spectrum of the oh masers in i18460 .",
    "table [ tab : features_oh ] gives the parameters of the oh maser spots detected using the two types of calibration scheme .",
    "the reason for the difference in the velocity ranges in which the maser spots are detected is unclear , but we speculate is due to the difference in the dynamic range caused by different conditions in phase calibration and the difference in the synthesized beam patterns .",
    "they are also exactly associated with the central 2o  maser components ( see section [ sec : oh ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : h2o ] shows a comprehensive view of the spatiokinematics of 2o  masers in i18460 found in the first three epochs . as shown in figure [ fig : h2o](a ) and ( b ) , the blue - shifted ( @xmath1@xmath2 @xmath3 ) and red - shifted ( @xmath4242 ) components are separated by @xmath5120  mas , corresponding to a linear scale of @xmath5240  au at 2  kpc .",
    "we detected highly collimated , fast proper motions of the blue - shifted masers ( @xmath3010  mas  yr@xmath17 ) with respect to the central masers .",
    "however , we could not measure proper motions of the red - shifted masers because they were detected at only the first epoch .",
    "nevertheless we can approximate the relative proper motions of the blue - shifted masers with respect to the central masers as the velocity vectors of one side of the bipolar jet components .",
    "the maser locations and motions projected on the sky give a dynamical age of the jet to be only @xmath56  yr in the observation epochs of 2006 september2007 february .",
    "the proper motions are well aligned along the jet axis , which is defined here to be a straight line connecting the blue - shifted masers with the red - shifted .",
    "the jet axis passes through the central masers .",
    "if we assume a circular distribution of the central masers ( a thick grey circle in figure [ fig : h2o](a ) ) , the separation between the circle center ( a plus symbol in figure [ fig : h2o](a ) ) and the jet axis is only @xmath510  mas ( @xmath520  au ) .",
    "because of the limited number of jet masers , this paper does not discuss a precessing jet model as proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the center velocity of the two velocity components of the jet masers ranges between @xmath3187113 , depending on which pair of the blue - shifted and red - shifted components are linked .",
    "pairing of the @xmath4242 and @xmath32  components gives @xmath31113 , which is close to the systemic velocities derived from the central components and the oh masers ( @xmath14125 ) as mentioned in sections [ sec : center ] and [ sec : oh ] , respectively .",
    "however , we can not rule out pairing the @xmath4242 and @xmath33  components to derive the center velocity .",
    "we derive a three - dimensional flow speed of @xmath34180  at an inclination of @xmath3532  with respect to the line of sight under the assumption of @xmath787 .",

    "[ sec : jet ] and as shown in figure [ fig : h2o](a ) , the distribution of a large fraction of 2o  maser features in the central component is well expressed by a ( thick ) ring with a radius of @xmath518  mas ( @xmath536  au ) .",
    "the maser features located in the central region but outside the ring are distributed in the east  west direction , perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "we are able to measure 11 relative proper motions of 2o  masers .",

    "the justification of the derived distance is discussed in section [ sec : distance ] .",
    "we obtained five _ absolute _ proper motions of 2o  maser features observed in 20082009 .",
    "because of intrinsic fading of the 2o  masers , we detect the central component with a smaller number of features than that in 20062007 . the northeast  southwest alignment and the proper motions of the 2o maser features found in 20082009 were similar to those found in 20062007 ( figure [ fig : h2o](c ) ) .",
    "therefore , we can assume that the masers from the different epochs are likely associated with a common origin .",
    "two out of the five maser features were detected in all three epochs in 20082009 .",
    "we fitted their absolute motions with respect to the position - reference source j1851 to the modeled motions , each of which was assumed to be composed of a constant velocity motion and an annual parallactic motion ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "table [ tab : secular - motion ] shows the results of the maser motion fitting .",
    "we obtained annual parallax values of 0.450.58  mas , corresponding to a range of the distance to i18460 of 1.72.2  kpc .",
    "however , the time baseline was too short ( only 5 months ) and the degree of freedom in the model fitting was too low ( @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the number of observing epochs ) for reliable analysis .",
    "therefore , the derived parallax was used just to extract the non - negligible parallax modulations and to obtain more precise linear proper motions required for further analysis .",
    "thus we derived the absolute proper motion of the position - reference maser feature ( 1846:i2013-_19 _ ) of @xmath72 mas in the celestial coordinates .",
    "figure [ fig : astrometry ] shows the relative proper motions of the 2o  maser features found in 20082009 with respect to the position - reference feature .",
    "they exhibit expanding flow motions , similar to the masers shown in figures [ fig : h2o](b)(c ) .",
    "this is clear even if we eliminate the motion of the feature , 1846:i2013-_17 _ , which was detected at only two epochs and whose measured large relative proper motion was doubtful . using the proper motion data of the features 1846:i2013- _ 16 _ , _ 18 _ , _ 19 _ , and _ 20 _ , we estimated the stellar motion to be @xmath73(mas  yr@xmath17 ) with respect to the position - reference feature .",
    "this corresponds to an expanding velocity of the cse of @xmath55 .",
    "the uncertainty of the relative stellar motion may be comparable to or smaller than this value .",

    "figure [ fig : astrometry ] shows the velocity - integrated brightness contour map of the two velocity components of the oh masers obtained from the self - calibration - based image cube . the origin of the contour map is set to the position of the reference oh maser spot at @xmath6111.7 , whose absolute coordinates were determined on the phase - referencing based image cube to be @xmath1818@xmath1948@xmath2043@xmath21.02701@xmath640@xmath21.00007 , @xmath22  @xmath1301@xmath1648@xmath23304526@xmath6400026 . interestingly , the position - reference 2o  feature and oh spot were located within 10  mas ( see section [ sec : secular - motion ] ) , corresponding to a linear scale of @xmath520  au , even taking into account the maser positions at the different epochs and the maser motions in the period of these epochs .",
    "the oh masers and the central 2o  ones have a common lsr velocity range ( 110140 ) and indicate similar expansion velocities ( 1020 , section [ sec : center ] ) .",
    "it is strongly suggested that these masers share a common origin .",
    "figure [ fig : oh ] shows the distribution of the oh masers in more detail .",
    "each of the maser spots was resolved out on baselines to the hartebeesthoek station : the spot size was estimated to be @xmath7525  mas .",
    "the blue - shifted and red - shifted clusters of oh maser spots were split into the east  west direction by a separation of @xmath550  mas , comparable to the extent of the central component of 2o  masers .",
    "the origin of a systematic lsr velocity gradient visible in only the red - shifted component is unknown and it should be investigated whether this velocity gradient is always visible .",
    "but we note that the directions of the elongation of the 2o maser distribution ( section [ sec : center ] ) , the cluster splitting , and the velocity gradient are perpendicular to the axis of the 2o  maser jet ( section [ sec : jet ] ) . furthermore , the expansion speeds and the angular distribution sizes are equal for the central component of 2o masers and the oh masers .",
    "these properties are similar to those of 2o  and oh masers in w  43a @xcite , where the existence of 2o  masers that are not associated with the collimated jet was first claimed . however , the kinematics of the w43a 2o  masers looks different from that of the oh maser although the kinematic information was quite limited in that source .",
    "the central component of 2o  masers in i18460 is the first example whose spatiokinematical structure was determined through the construction of the radially expanding flow model as described in section [ sec : center ] and compared with the kinematics of the oh masers .",
    "the results of this paper favor a much shorter distance to i18460 ( @xmath762.0  kpc ) than the derived kinematic distance ( @xmath776.9  kpc ) .",
    "the latter value is obtained when one uses only the radial velocity and assumes a circular orbit of i18460 in the milky way .",
    "this suggests that this source is located close to a tangential point in the milky way . using both the radial velocity and the proper motion ( section [ sec : secular - motion ] ) , @xmath786.0 or 7.8  kpc is obtained .",
    "however , unless the maser source is of a young generation , the assumption of a circular orbit is unlikely ( see also section [ sec : secular - motions2 ] ) .",
    "as described in section [ sec : center ] , the statistical parallax distance to i18460 is estimated as @xmath79  kpc .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : h2o ] , the distribution of the central components of 2o  masers is elongated in the east  west direction . in addition , as shown in figure [ fig : spherical - flow ] , the expanding flow appears to be accelerated outward .",
    "these results may affect this estimate of distance ; the variance of proper motions may have a bias in the east  west direction . in practice , as already mentioned , the outward acceleration is negligible and the calculated results support that such a variance bias is also negligible . on the other hand , if these 2o  masers are associated with a face - on equatorial flow , then a transverse velocity variance larger than that in the radial direction is expected , causing a possible bias to a shorter distance .",
    "this possibility is also unlikely when taking into account the similarity of the kinematics of the 2o  masers to that of the 1612  mhz oh masers , which suggest spherical expansion .",
    "thus , even the possible bias in @xmath80 can not explain the much shorter distance to i18460 .",
    "the annual parallax unambiguously rules out a large @xmath81 , although the uncertainty of the parallax is very large .",
    "the driving mechanism of the wf jet is still in debate , but a comparison of the jet parameters with other parameters of the wf sources will shed light on the mechanism . for those wfs with an estimated three - dimensional jet velocity , however , we find so far no clear correlation among the three - dimensional velocity , dynamical age , and degree of collimation of the jet and the stellar luminosity ( roughly evaluated with the _ iras _ flux at the 25  @xmath82 m band multiplied by the square of the source distance ) .",
    "an offset of the center velocity of a collimated jet from the systemic velocity of a cse and an angular offset of the originating point of a collimated jet from that of a cse are observable in the maser spatiokinematics .",
    "the existence of these offsets implies the existence of a binary system in which the jet and the cse originate from different host stars . in the case of i18460 , as shown in figures [ fig : h2o ] and [ fig : astrometry ] ( see sections [ sec : jet ] , [ sec : center ] , and [ sec : oh ] ) , an upper limit to the angular offset mentioned above was given to be @xmath220  mas ( @xmath240  au at 2  kpc ) .",
    "the center velocity offset was derived to be 1040  from the center velocity of the jet 2o  masers and the systemic velocity derived from the oh maser spectrum ( see section [ sec : jet ] ) .",
    "the derived velocity offset is roughly consistent with those in iras  16342@xmath133814 and iras  18286@xmath130959 , in which the center velocities of 2o  and oh masers differ by up to 30(@xcite , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "however , uncertainties of these center velocities of the jet masers are large .",
    "unless the point symmetry of the 2o  maser spectra is well examined , the large uncertainty of the center velocity of the jet can not be reduced , so it prevents us from any realistic constraint on the orbital parameters of a supposed binary system or being convinced of the existence of the binary system .    here",
    ", we consider the possibility of identification of a binary system , with one component driving the wf jet while the other hosts the cse .",
    "the latter may be an o - rich intermediate - mass agb or post - agb star @xcite , * so here we assume a current stellar mass of @xmath141  @xmath83*. in the case of w  43a , in which the center velocities of the 2o , oh , and sio masers are estimated to be consistent with one another within a few , it is possible to consider a separation of 100  au between two stars , which is comparable to the upper limit to the separation estimated from the maser observations ( @xcite , see also the case of oh  12.8@xmath130.9 , @xcite ) .",
    "if a companion orbits the supposed star with a velocity of 1040  as estimated in i18460 , the separation of these stars may be in a range of 0.69  au , which can not be spatially resolved with the current analysis technique relying on the maser data .",
    "on the other hand , the case of the highest velocity offset corresponds to a velocity fluctuation of the host star of @xmath750.3  at 9  au and an orbital period of @xmath230  yr .",
    "these derived parameters will be examined in future infrared and sub - millimeter observations which can resolve such a scale and which will enable us to conduct high - resolution spectroscopy of molecular lines associated with the central stars and the accompanying jets and cses . in any case , finding point a symmetric distribution of the jet masers and a reasonable jet model may be necessary to more precisely estimate the center velocity of the jet , which is essential to identify a binary system .",
    "it is noteworthy that the 2o  masers in i18460 had faded between the 20062007 and 20082009 seasons .",
    "it should be taken into account that stellar 2o  masers are highly variable in both their angular and velocity distribution and some of the variation will be correlated with stellar pulsation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of the wf jet masers , however , it is possible that we are observing _ the evolution _ of the jet on a timescale comparable to the estimated dynamical time scale ( see section [ sec : jet ] ) .",
    "we have to confirm , using future long - term observations , whether we are observing the true  death \" of a wf or recurrent jet ejections ; this should reveal the role of the wf jet in shaping the future planetary nebula .",
    "the agb cse / equatorial flow as well as the collimated fast jet is important components to probe the evolutionary status of the wf source . as mentioned in section [ sec : oh ] , the oh masers and the central component of 2o  masers in i18460 resemble those of agb cses . taking into account that these masers do not have a high expansion velocity ( @xmath84815 ) and they trace only a limited volume of the cse or equatorial flow , these masers likely have close association with each other as shown in some oh / ir stars .",
    "it is noteworthy that the equatorial elongation in the 2o / oh cse is still marginal .",
    "it is suggested that the 1612  mhz oh masers are radially amplified and it is possible that their area projected on the plane of sky is sometimes smaller than that of 2o  masers . even taking into account these factors , the noted properties of the oh and 2o  masers in i18460 imply that this cse may be a relic agb cse rather than a product of recent rapid growth of an equatorial torus or flow as suggested by @xcite . because the collimated jet of i18460 still looks extremely young ( it has a dynamical age of only @xmath146  yr , see section [ sec : jet ] ) it is too early to observe the intrinsic evolution of the equatorial flow even if it is recently launched .",
    "@xcite suggested a time lag of a few hundred years between the rapid growth of the equatorial torus and the ignition of the collimated jet . in practice ,",
    "the dynamical age of the i18460 cse is only @xmath5140  yr . any dynamical age derived from the data of 2o  and",
    "oh masers may be much shorter than the true age of the dynamical component ( i.e. , jet or cse ) .",
    "nevertheless we believe that the former time scale is meaningful when comparing the dynamical time scales among the maser sources when discussing the evolution of the maser sources .",
    "in fact , @xcite and @xcite have found the temporal evolution of the 2o  maser jets in w  43a and oh  12.8@xmath130.9 on the decade scale , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the expansion rate of the 2o  maser region in the jet is roughly consistent with that expected from the dynamical ages.3814 @xcite , in which relative proper motions of the 2o  observed in 20082009 were completely different from those in 2002 @xcite .",
    "the authors pointed out two possible causes of the result .",
    "we also consider their second possibility as an extreme case , in which 2o  masers reached the edge of the cse and maser excitation does not occur at a distance larger than that to this point from the star . ]",
    "it is unclear whether the existence of the relic agb cse indicates that its hosting source is in the early phase of the wf .",
    "as already mentioned , the dynamical ages of the cses are much longer than those of the jets .",
    "the jet will affect only the inner part of the cse in the wf phase , and the volume of the interaction with the highly collimated jet will be still quite limited .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to find any correlation between the kinematic parameters of the jet and the cse with the overall properties of the cse as traced by its infrared colors .",
    "however , if we suppose a beaming effect of 2o  and oh masers , the small interaction with the jet may enhance the difference in preferred locations of these masers in the cse .",
    "similar to 1612  mhz oh masers , 2o  masers in a cse prefer radial beaming , in which the maser emission is amplified radially with respect to the central star ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", one can see 2o  masers associated with the cse if the collimated jet breaks up the cse only along the plane of the sky while the cse is still maintained in the line of sight .",
    "after checking the previous vlbi observations of wfs @xcite , we speculate that the central 2o  masers of the wfs , associated with relic agb cses , may be visible in the case in which the jet inclination angle with respect to the line of sight is sufficiently large ( @xmath8530 ) .",
    "this speculation should be further examined in future vlbi observations of other wfs .",
    "as shown in sections [ sec : center ] and [ sec : secular - motion ] , we have derived the distance and the secular motion of i18460 to be @xmath86  kpc and @xmath74 mas , respectively . based on these values , we further estimate the location and the three - dimensional motion of i18460 in the milky way . table [ tab : mw - motion ] gives the list of relevant parameters .",
    "we note common properties of the wfs whose kinematics in the milky way have been estimated ( iras  19134@xmath152131 , @xcite ; iras  18286@xmath130959 , paper i ) . although some of the wfs are located several hundred parsecs away from the galactic mid - plane ( iras  163424@xmath133814 , iras  19134@xmath152131 ) , a large fraction of the wfs is located in the galactic thin disk as seen for massive - star forming regions .",
    "nevertheless , their three - dimensional motions have large deviations by @xmath7550  from those expected from the circular galactic rotation .",
    "it is expected that the motions of the wf sources have such large deviation as a result of dynamical relaxation during their relatively long lifetimes ( @xmath87  yr ) . however ,",
    "this is inconsistent with the observation that some of the wfs , including i18460 , still persist in the galactic mid - plane .",
    "paper i point out the possibility of a binary motion for such a peculiar motion .",
    "the present vlba and evn observations have revealed the spatiokinematical structures of both of the collimated fast jet and the slowly expanding equatorial flow or cse associated with i18460 .",
    "the dynamical ages of these kinematical components are extremely short ( @xmath146 and @xmath14140  yr , respectively ) although these values may not be equal to their true ages .",
    "the suggestion that i18460 should be in a very young stage of the wf evolution is supported by its association with the cse as seen in oh / ir stars .",
    "the driving sources of the different components are located within @xmath1410  mas ( @xmath1420  au ) , a situation very similar to the case of the 2o  and sio masers in w  43a @xcite . by adding the present results , the common properties of the three - dimensional velocity vectors of the wfs in the milky way have been elucidated , which implies that the wfs harbor binary systems .",
    "future observations that enable us to resolve such binary systems ( @xmath220  au at a few kilo parsecs ) , as those conducted with new facilities such as the atacama large millimeter - submillimeter array ( alma ) , will directly shed light on the evolution of agb / post - agb stars generating the wfs .",
