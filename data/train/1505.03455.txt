    "supersymmetry remains at present a favored solution to the hierarchy problem of the standard model  ( sm ) .",
    "supersymmetry is obviously a broken symmetry , as none of the superpartners of the sm particles have been experimentally observed so far .",
    "the idea of weak scale supersymmetry , as embodied , for example , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model  ( mssm ) , as a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem has already been partly tested at the large hadron collider  ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "the most minimal constrained model is found to be disfavoured , and the emphasis in the studies has moved to other well motivated models .",
    "the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking , which is crucial for determining the masses of the superpartners of the sm particles , is not known at present .",
    "there are different viable models of supersymmetry breaking in which supersymmetry breaking is mediated by a specific interaction in a hidden sector and is communicated to the visible sector via some mediator fields .",
    "well known examples of hidden sector supersymmetry breaking include gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking  @xcite , gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking  @xcite , and anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking  @xcite , respectively .",
    "it is usually assumed that one mediation mechanism dominates , which depends on the type of problem that one wishes to address in the context of mssm .",
    "in fact , it may well be that a single mediation mechanism does not dominate . in some situations the anomaly mediated and gravity mediated contributions to the supersymmetry breaking",
    "can coexist and manifest at a comparable value , leading to what is known as mirage mediation , a situation that naturally arises in some string theories  @xcite .",
    "the name derives from the fact that soft gaugino masses unify at a scale  ( the mirage scale ) which is lower than the grand unification or gut scale .",
    "models based on mirage mediation can solve the tachyonic slepton mass problem of the anomaly mediation models .",
    "the mirage mediation models have been studied extensively in the literature  @xcite .    however , in the absence of any definite experimental indication regarding the mass spectrum of the sparticles , it is important to consider the case where all the three types of supersymmetry breakings contribute to the soft masses , and ultimately determine the mass spectrum of the supersymmetric partners of the sm states .",
    "such a scenario has been dubbed as deflected mirage mediation  @xcite . in the deflected mirage mediation",
    "the gaugino mass unification is deflected by the threshold effect from the messenger fields associated with the gauge mediation contribution .",
    "the messenger fields are included at scales @xmath0 , and the renormalization group running is affected by the threshold corrections at this scale .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that in a broad class of supergravity models , which might be realized in string theory , the contributions to soft supersymmetry breaking masses from the three different mediation mechanisms are comparable @xcite .",
    "this makes the study of deflected mirage mediation models rather compelling .    as discussed above , in order to predict the masses of the superpartners of the sm particles , it is essential to understand the nature of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the usual approach to this has been to consider a particular model of supersymmetry breaking , e.g. the gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking model  ( usualy referred to as msugra ) with a limited number of parameters at the high scale  ( possibly the gut scale ) , and evolve these , using renormalization group equations , to the electroweak scale and fit them to the data  @xcite .",
    "this method , the so called `` top - down '' approach has some drawbacks , namely that the reliability of the fit decreases with the increase of the number of parameters at the high scale .",
    "this approach is also sensitive to uncertainities of the measured quantities , which includes gauge couplings at the electroweak scale and the masses of the sm particles .    an alternative approach , which is complementary to the `` top - down '' approach , that has been advocated involves the measured masses at the elctroweak scale and evolve these to the high scale where supersymmetry is broken  @xcite .",
    "the resulting structure is then analyzed and conclusions about the underlying theory at high scales obtained .",
    "this approach , which can be called `` bottom - up '' approach , has uncertainities resulting from the present experimental uncertainities in the measurement of gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "another alternative to obtain information on the nature of supersymmetry breaking is to obtain specific relations among the masses of the superpartners of the sm particles which result from the structure of the underlying theory at the high scale . in this approach",
    "the yukawa couplings of the first- and second - generations are usually ignored and the renormalization group is used to evolve the parameters from high scale to the low scale , and then specific relations among sparticle masses are derived based on the particular theory at the high scale  @xcite . in this context",
    "it has also been pointed out that there are a set of combinations of parameters of a supersymmetric model that are renormalization group invariant  ( rgi ) at the 1-loop level  @xcite .",
    "although the argument regarding rgi holds only at the leading - log order , 2-loop corrections are expected to be small and are likely to be negligible compared with the experimental uncertainities .",
    "thus , these higher order effects can either be neglected or absorbed into a shift of the measured values of the renormalization group invariants .",
    "it has been argued that these rgis can be used to extract the parameters of different supersymmetry breaking models at the high scale , and thereby establish the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "rgis can also be used for constructing sum rules relating the particle masses , and they are discussed in this context in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we derive the renormalization group invariants for deflected mirage mediation and examine how the appearance of messenger particles at the specific energy scale lower than the gut - scale affects the invariants .",
    "we investigate the gut - scale parameters of the deflected mirage mediation in terms of the rgis , and examine validity of sum rules derived previously of the rgis and derive new ones specific to the deflected mirage mediation .",
    "in particular , we derive soft supersymmetry breaking parameters in terms of the rgis .",
    "we also examine the higgs mass in the deflected mirage mediation scenario to constrain the parameters of the model .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : dmm ] , we describe the deflected mirage mediation mechanism that we consider in this paper .",
    "here we analyze the soft supersymmetry breaking gaugino and scalar masses of the model , and the boundary conditions on these parameters .",
    "phenomenological implications , which include the higgs mass , are studied in this section . in section  [ sec : rginvariants ] we describe the renormalization group invariants and calculate these invariants for the deflected mirage mediation supersymmetry breaking model .",
    "we then use these invariants to solve for the parameters of the model . in section",
    "[ sec : sumrules ] we obtain sum rules for the deflected mirage mediation scenario and discuss some special cases . in section  v we proceed to compare the predictions of the pure mirage mediation scenario with those of the gravity , amsb , and the gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking models , respectively .",

    "<S> we examine the deflected mirage mediation supersymmetry breaking ( dmmsb ) scenario , which combines three supersymmetry breaking scenarios , namely anomaly mediation , gravity mediation and gauge mediation using the one - loop renormalization group invariants ( rgis ) . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the effects on the rgis at the threshold where the gauge messengers emerge , and derive the supersymmetry breaking parameters in terms of the rgis . </S>",
    "<S> we further discuss whether supersymmetry breaking mediation mechanism can be determined using a limited set of invariants , and derive sum rules valid for dmmsb below the gauge messenger scale . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we examine the implications of the measured higgs mass for the dmmsb spectrum .    </S>",
