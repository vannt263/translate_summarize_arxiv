    "in any thorough investigation of meson production or other reactions resulting from nucleon - nucleon collisions , it is important to have proton - neutron data as well as proton - proton .",
    "medium energy neutron beams , even when produced from stripped deuterons , have a significant momentum spread .",
    "unless the @xmath3 centre - of - mass energy is determined by other means , such as by measuring all final - state particles , these neutron beams are not suitable for measuring cross sections that vary fast with energy , as is the case for meson production near threshold .",
    "the alternative , of using the neutron inside deuterium as a target for a proton beam , faces similar problems due to the fermi motion of the neutron in the target . despite the typical neutron momentum in the deuteron being only around 60  mev / c , this spreads the c.m.energy by approximately 100  mev , depending upon the mass of the meson being produced .",
    "a precise experiment therefore requires all final - state particles to be measured also in this approach .",
    "the suggestion of using the deuteron as a substitute for a neutron target is very plausible because the average proton - neutron separation in the nucleus is about 4  fm , which is large compared to the typical range of forces between elementary particles . to a good first approximation then , an incident particle will interact with either a proton or neutron target , leaving the other nucleon in the deuteron as a _ spectator _ , moving with the momentum that it had before the collision . in the thick targets used in bubble chamber or electronic measurements with external beams",
    ", one rarely detects such a spectator particle , which has an energy of only a few mev .",
    "this situation has been radically changed with the advent of medium energy proton storage rings where one can work with thin windowless targets .",
    "it then becomes feasible to measure the proton spectators in solid state counters placed in the vacuum of the target chamber inside such a ring .",
    "knowing the beam energy and the spectator momentum allows one to reconstruct the c.m.energy of the proton - neutron system without measuring all the particles produced in this reaction . in this way it is possible to exploit the intrinsic target momenta , measuring a cross section over a range of well - defined c.m .",
    "energies while working at a fixed beam momentum .",
    "furthermore , merely identifying a spectator proton @xmath0 is an indication that the production reaction has taken place on the neutron and not on the proton , thus simplifying significantly the subsequent data analysis .",
    "these ideas have all been successfully tested in an initial experiment at the celsius ring , where the spectator protons were measured in a set of simple silicon detectors  @xcite .",
    "all final particles in the @xmath1 reaction were detected , with the two photons from the @xmath4 decay being used as the trigger . using a circulating beam",
    "whose energy was fixed at 320  mev , the authors could deduce within the spectator model the variation of the @xmath2 total cross section at five c.m.energies near threshold and this agreed with the results from standard data compilations . on the other hand",
    ", the lack of an independent luminosity measurement meant that it was not possible to determine absolute cross sections .",
    "since there is no room for these spectator counters in the new wasa target chamber at celsius , they are now being used at cosy to study the @xmath5 reaction  @xcite .    at the cosy - anke facility of the forschungszentrum jlich",
    "we have extended the celsius technique by constructing a telescope of three silicon detectors , the details of which are given in section  2 .",
    "the self - triggering capabilities of the telescope allow efficient data taking at high particle fluxes . as discussed in the following section , the set - up yields good measurements of both the energies and angles of slow protons and deuterons emerging from a deuterium target . using the @xmath6-@xmath7 technique",
    "the system permits particle identification and , in particular , the separation of recoil protons from deuterons over significant energy ranges .",
    "one new feature of this set - up is its capability of working down to proton momenta of 70@xmath8mev / c .",
    "not only are the achievable statistics significantly increased , as compared to experiments with higher threshold energies , but also the interpretation of the data in terms of its model dependence becomes substantially simplified .",
    "the technique is put to the test in section  4 , where the measurement of the @xmath9 reaction away from threshold is described . by using a deuterium cluster - jet target and detecting the fast deuteron in the forward system of the anke magnetic spectrometer , the @xmath4",
    "could be identified as a peak in the @xmath10 missing mass .",
    "the @xmath2 total cross section thus extracted agrees with the results deduced from previous experiments .    in subsequent experiments",
    "the spectator telescope has been used to measure the total cross sections for the @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath12  @xcite reactions near threshold . at the high beam momenta required for @xmath13 production ,",
    "the recoil deuterons from elastic proton - deuteron scattering can also be detected in the telescope and used to determine the luminosity by comparing with known @xmath14 differential cross sections .",
    "another application of the set - up is the measurement of the beam polarisation , which is vitally important for the polarised experimental programme at anke .",
    "these measurements , and the outlook for further work , are outlined in our conclusions of the final section .",
    "the anke facility is a magnetic spectrometer and detection system placed at an internal target position of the cosy light - ion storage ring  @xcite . in order to extend its capabilities through the detection of recoil particles with very low momenta ,",
    "a telescope consisting of three layers of silicon detectors has been chosen , as sketched in top view in fig .  [",
    "f : sp_setup ] .",
    "this enables tracking , energy determination , and particle identification to be carried out within the constraints imposed by the restricted space inside the anke vacuum chamber .    in order to identify a particle _ via _ the @xmath6-@xmath7 method and to determine its kinetic energy , it has to be stopped after traversing a preceding detector and depositing part of its energy therein . now",
    "the fermi momentum of a spectator proton in the deuteron is on average about 60@xmath8mev / c ( @xmath15mev ) and only about 5% of protons have momenta above 250@xmath8mev / c .",
    "moreover , at the higher momenta one has problems in being sure that the recoil proton is indeed a spectator rather than an active participant in a reaction .    a 5@xmath8 mm thick lithium - drifted strip detector  @xcite stops protons with kinetic energies up to 31@xmath8mev , _",
    "i.e. _ momenta up to @xmath16mev / c . taken in combination with a 300@xmath17 m thick detector , protons with @xmath18mev could in principle be used . however , as will be seen in the following section , detection thresholds and angular straggling considerations increase this limit to @xmath19mev . in order to extend this range down to kinetic energies of 2.5@xmath8mev ,",
    "an initial layer consisting of a 60@xmath17 m thick surface - barrier detector was also installed .",
    "this choice combines a low threshold for protons , with energy deposits sufficient to distinguish protons from deuterons .",
    "though it would have been very helpful to reduce the energy threshold for spectator protons by using , say , an 18@xmath17 m thick surface - barrier detector , it was found in a separate test measurement  @xcite that the energy resolution _ versus _ band separation in this case would not suffice to distinguish between protons and deuterons .",
    "the details of the layers finally chosen are given in table  [ t : si_detectors ] .",
    ".principal properties of the detectors used in the spectator telescope .",
    "the first layer is circular and not segmented . for the others ,",
    "the number of strips and their pitch , is given .",
    "the energy resolution of the detectors was deduced from measurements with an @xmath20-particle source , and the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the peaks , which characterises the noise level , is given . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t : sp ]    in order to study the experimental energy and angular resolution of the silicon layers _ prior _ to the measurements at cosy , a dedicated experiment was performed using the proton beam at the tandem accelerator of the institute of nuclear physics of the university of cologne  @xcite .",
    "this led to the choice of a suitable first layer detector .",
    "it also showed that the position in the 5@xmath8 mm detector , read out using a resistor chain , could be reconstructed with an accuracy better than 300@xmath17 m in absolute value .",
    "the angular resolution is then dominated by angular straggling , which was measured to be in good agreement with results from monte - carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "the target chamber of anke is placed just in front of the spectrometer magnet d2 such that the low energy protons and deuterons detected by the telescope are perturbed by the stray magnetic field . though the fields in this region , @xmath21 t , are much smaller than the maximum values in the spectrometer , @xmath22 t",
    ", significant corrections have to be introduced because of the low spectator proton momenta .",
    "corrections of 0.6@xmath23 to 1.8@xmath23 relative to straight lines , depending upon the spectator energy , have been obtained from monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic dipole of anke , combined with the forward detector system of multiwire proportional counters ( mwpcs ) , scintillator hodoscope and inclined erenkov counters , allows us to identify and measure the momenta of fast particles produced in coincidence with spectator protons in the silicon telescope .",
    "this system , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : anke ] , is described in detail in ref .",
    "the detection and identification of two charged particles allows one to select the production of a single meson , such as the @xmath4 , @xmath24 , or @xmath13 , through the missing mass technique .    to test this method of investigating meson production in proton - neutron interactions at anke",
    ", we have measured the @xmath25 reaction at a beam momentum of 1.2@xmath8gev / c . in fig .",
    "[ f : d_id ] the energy losses of particles in the first plane of the scintillator hodoscope of anke are plotted _ versus _ their reconstructed momenta . the spectrum is dominated by the proton peak around 1.2@xmath8gev / c corresponding to small - angle deuteron break - up events",
    ". however , one also observes clear proton and deuteron bands and , by imposing a momentum - dependent threshold between them , one can reduce the proton contribution significantly . since the landau tail from the quasi - elastic protons",
    "can not be suppressed very effectively at high momenta , only the range below 1.15@xmath8gev / c was selected when extracting the @xmath2 cross section , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ f : d_id ] .",
    "the experimental momentum distribution is compared in fig .  [",
    "f : pi0_p ] to a gaussian fit for the @xmath26 events plus a polynomial _",
    "ansatz _ for the background .",
    "the number of detected events for the @xmath2 reaction has been deduced solely from this figure where , unlike for the missing - mass representation , the distribution is not biased by the assumption that the fast particle is a deuteron . since the experiment was carried out very close to the two - pion threshold , the background must arise primarily from protons misidentified as deuterons .",
    "this is consistent with the missing mass distribution for the same events , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : pi0_mx ] .",
    "there is a clear peak at around 140@xmath8mev / c@xmath27 , corresponding to the undetected @xmath4 .",
    "the large width comes from measuring pion production well above threshold with a limited angular resolution of the forward array .",
    "the small shift compared to the true pion mass is consistent with the geometric precision of the set - up .",
    "the second peak towards the maximum missing mass is due to the proton background .",
    "+    the integrated luminosity for the @xmath4 production experiment at 600@xmath8mev was obtained by counting protons elastically and quasi - elastically scattered from the target at laboratory angles between 5@xmath23 and 10@xmath23 , as described in ref .",
    "it is not possible to separate cleanly @xmath28 from @xmath29 events using just the anke forward detector information , though the momentum resolution is sufficient to exclude pion production .",
    "the inclusive @xmath30 differential cross section can be reliably estimated within the glauber model  @xcite .",
    "such a calculation , which takes into account the sum of elastic and inelastic terms in closure approximation , could be checked in part using the results obtained on the @xmath14 differential cross section , which has been measured close to our energy at @xmath31mev  @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the luminosity can be obtained to @xmath32 using this procedure  @xcite . the reduction in flux due to the presence of a second nucleon in the target ( shadowing ) , has been taken into account by a 5% correction , similar to that used for @xmath24 production  @xcite .    to calculate the acceptance of the whole system , the @xmath33 reaction was simulated using the pluto event generator  @xcite , which includes the fermi motion in the deuteron .",
    "the events thus obtained were fed into the standard geant3 program  @xcite , adjusted to the geometry of the anke .",
    "finally , the momenta of both the spectator proton and fast deuteron were subjected to the experimental cuts imposed by the spectator telescope and forward detector system respectively .    after correcting for the tracking efficiency in the wire chambers and the spectator detection , we deduce a total cross section of @xmath34 mb at an effective mean beam energy of @xmath35mev .",
    "the c.m .",
    "energy is here reconstructd to 7@xmath8mev fwhm . a direct measurement of this cross section with a neutron beam at this energy gave @xmath36 mb  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , on the basis of isospin , @xmath37 mb , where we have used values from the standard data compilation  @xcite .",
    "the agreement with our result is therefore very satisfactory .",
    "we have here described the construction and application of a solid state telescope capable of measuring slow protons and deuterons in the ultra - high vacuum conditions pertaining at an internal - target station of a storage ring .",
    "the technique enables us not only to identify the particles but , also to measure their kinetic energies with 1% precision . using the tracking capabilities of the set - up the angle of the spectator",
    "can be determined and the relative positions of the target and all detectors measured , such that geometrical uncertainties are minimised .",
    "the combination of the silicon telescope with a magnetic analysis system for fast particles permits the identification of reactions on the neutron in the deuterium target and the measurement of their absolute cross sections .",
    "the centre - of - mass energies in such reactions are well defined by the kinematics of the spectator proton and , in fact , the deuteron fermi motion allows a scan over a wide range of energies while keeping the beam momentum fixed .",
    "apart from the @xmath2 test experiment reported here , the system has already been used to investigate near - threshold @xmath13  @xcite and @xmath24  @xcite production from the neutron .",
    "a further use of this technique is the monitoring of the luminosity in experiments at storage rings .",
    "the energy of a recoil deuteron detected near @xmath38 determines very well the kinematics of elastic proton - deuteron scattering , thus fixing the luminosity in terms of the @xmath14 differential cross section .",
    "this method was employed in the analysis of our @xmath39 measurement  @xcite and other reactions at anke . with the current set - up it",
    "could not be used for the @xmath2 measurement presented here .",
    "this geometric limitation can be overcome by an optimised positioning of the system within the redesigned vacuum chamber at anke .",
    "it is important to note that the telescope can also be used to evaluate the luminosity for @xmath40 reactions with a hydrogen target by measuring the low energy proton from @xmath40 elastic scattering near @xmath38 .",
    "another application of the set - up is the measurement of the beam polarisation , which is becoming increasingly important in view of the number of polarisation measurements proposed at cosy  @xcite .",
    "it was proven , using the telescope described here , that it was possible to do this in parallel to data - taking without any harm to or restriction on the beam  @xcite .",
    "the experience gained in building and using the spectator counter system has been put to use in the design of second - generation silicon telescopes  @xcite .",
    "putting four of these new telescopes even closer to the beam will increase the geometrical acceptance by a factor 40 .",
    "since all the detectors , especially the 65@xmath17 m layers , will be double - sided strip detectors , the angles of even low energy spectators will be measured to @xmath41 .",
    "this means that the tracks from the extended target region of a polarised gas target could also be reconstructed .",
    "this will open the window to use polarised deuterium as a source for polarised proton - polarised neutron physics .",
    "we would like to thank t.  krings , g.  fiori , and m.  metz for designing , engineering and testing the 5@xmath8 mm thick silicon detectors .",
