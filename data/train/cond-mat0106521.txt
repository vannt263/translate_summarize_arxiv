    "<S> we make the first report that a metallic pyrochlore oxide 2re2o7 , exhibits type ii superconductivity at 1.1 k. the pyrochlore oxide is known to be a geometrical frustrated system , which includes the tetrahedral network of magnetic ions . </S>",
    "<S> a large number of compounds are classified in the family of pyrochlore oxides , and these compounds exhibit a wide variety of physical properties ranging from insulator through semiconductor and from bad metal to good metal . until now , however , no superconductivity has been reported for frustrated pyrochlore oxides . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk superconductivity of this compound is confirmed by measurements of the resistivity and the a. c. magnetic susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> the 2 , which is extrapolated to 0 k , is estimated as about 0.8 t , using the resistivity measurements under aplied field . </S>",
    "<S> the plot of 2 vs @xmath0 indicates that the cooper pairs are composed of rather heavy quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> this fact suggests that frustrated heavy electrons become superconducting in this compound .    </S>",
    "<S> recently the subject of geometrical frustration in strongly correlated electron systems has attracted considerable interest . </S>",
    "<S> the ground states of these systems are expected to be highly degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> such high degeneracies lead to thermodynamic instability at low temperatures . lifting these degeneracies </S>",
    "<S> makes possible the production of exotic quantum ground states , such as spin - liquid , heavy fermion , and unconventional superconductivity .    the pyrochlore oxide , which has a general formula 2b2o6o , contains a tetrahedral network of a or b cations , leading to geometrical frustration . </S>",
    "<S> the a cations are eight - fold coordinated with six o and two o anions and are located within distorted cubes , while the smaller b cations are six - fold coordinated and are located within distorted octahedra of which the six bond lengths from the central b cation to the corner o anion are equal . </S>",
    "<S> the corner - sharing bo@xmath1 octahedra compose a three - dimensional network as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ crystalstructure]a . </S>",
    "<S> the sublattice of b cations composes a three - dimensional corner - shared tetrahedral network , namely , the pyrochlore lattice as shown in fig.[crystalstructure]b . if the a cations are non - magnetic and the b cations are magnetic , the b - spin magnetic couplings are strongly frustrated under a nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange interaction . for the case of localized electron spin moments , theoretical studies of the heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice have suggested that the ground state of such an insulator would be long - range magnetic order@xcite , spin - freezing@xcite , or quantum spin liquid@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the geometrical frustration plays a crucial role even in the case of itinerant electrons in the pyrochlore lattice . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the metallic spinel oxide liv@xmath2o@xmath3 , which has a pyrochlore lattice of vanadium , has been reported to show heavy fermion behavior at low temperatures due to the geometrical frustration@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a large number of compounds are classified in the family of pyrochlore oxides , and these compounds exhibit a wide variety of physical properties ranging from insulator through semiconductor and from bad metal to good metal@xcite . until now , however , no superconductivity has been reported for frustrated pyrochlore oxides . here </S>",
    "<S> , we make the first report that a metallic cubic pyrochlore oxide 2re2o7 , exhibits type ii superconductivity at 1.1 k.    polycrystalline samples of 2re2o7 were prepared by solid state reaction . </S>",
    "<S> a stoichiometric mixture of cdo , reo@xmath4 , and re metal was pelletized , and put into an alumina tammann tube . </S>",
    "<S> the pellet in the tammann tube was further inserted into an evacuated silica tube and preheated at 300 for several hours in order to avoid a vaporization of the starting materials . </S>",
    "<S> then , the pellet was heated at 1000 for several hours . the powder xrd pattern measured at room temperature was identified as the cubic pyrochlore structure with a lattice parameter a=10.221 , which is consistent with the previous report@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the direct current ( d. c. ) electrical resistivity of the sintered sample of 2re2o7 was measured using a standard four - probe technique in the temperature range of 0.3 to 300 k under applied field from 0 to 2 t. low - temperature measurements below 1.9 k were performed using a @xmath5he refrigerator . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ resistivity ] shows the temperature dependence of the d.c . </S>",
    "<S> electrical resistivity of 2re2o7 under zero applied field . </S>",
    "<S> the electrical resistivity shows a steep descent below @xmath6 200 k. this anomaly at @xmath7 was observed in the d.c . magnetic susceptibility measurement as well . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this anormaly has not been identified . </S>",
    "<S> the electrical resistivity drops to zero sharply at the onset superconducting temperature = 1.1 k , and shows effectively zero resistivity below 1.05 k. changes of driving electric current density produced slight differences in the resistivity below 1.7 k , an effect which may be due to the superconductivity of a small amount of impurity rhenium metal ( = 1.7 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity transition at 1.1 k is not due to filamentary superconductivity of re , since the observed critical field is much larger than the critical field of re ( 0.02 t ) , as will be described below . </S>",
    "<S> the large residual resistivity of @xmath8 cm may suggest a low carrier density of this system . from band calculations , </S>",
    "<S> it is pointed out that the system has a very small density of states at the fermi level , which is located within the 5d - band and in the valley between the very flat bands of the rhenium 5d electrons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the electronic specific heat coefficient has been found to be large , _ </S>",
    "<S> i. e. _ , @xmath9=13.3 mj / re mol@xmath10 k@xmath11@xcite , indicating that heavy quasiparticles are formed due to the spin - frustration in this compound .    the alternating current ( a. c. ) magnetic susceptibility was measured by a mutual- inductance method at a magnetic field of 2@xmath1210@xmath13 t in the temperature range of 0.3 to 1.8 k. as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ acchi ] , a strong diamagnetic signal ( @xmath14 ) has been observed below 1.06 k , which corresponds to the end - point transition temperature of the electrical resistivity measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the dissipative component @xmath14  shows only a small peak around , indicating no weak superconducting link between superconducting grains . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting volume fraction was estimated roughly as @xmath15 50 % at 0.3 k. from this experiment , a bulk superconducting state has been strongly confirmed in 2re2o7 below 1.1 k.    to estimate the superconducting critical field , the magnetic field dependence of has been determined by resistivity measurements . as the magnetic field was applied , the sample maintained zero resistivity until the field reached 2 . at 2 </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity was quenched abruptly as shown in fig.[hc2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the upper critical field , which is extrapolated to zero temperature in the plot of 2 vs @xmath0 ( fig . [ hc2 ] , inset ) using the whh model@xcite , is estimated as 2 ( 0)=0.8 t. the superconducting coherence length , @xmath16 is expressed as @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the fluxoid quantum ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pippard coherence length , @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath21 is the superconducting energy gap at @xmath0=0 k ) was obtained as about 300   using the relation , @xmath22 for a clean superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> this compound is considered to be a clean superconductor , since the mean free path @xmath23 is estimated as @xmath24 m @xmath25 @xmath26 , using the drude relation , @xmath27 with resistivity @xmath28 m and carrier concentration @xmath29 m@xmath30 which is a typical value for metallic pyrochlore compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the observed large initial slope of 2 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath31 @xmath15 1 t / k@xmath11 , indicates that the cooper pairs are composed of rather heavy quasiparticles , since @xmath31 is proportional to the square of effective mass @xmath32 , in agreement with the large @xmath9 value . </S>",
    "<S> this fact suggests , indeed , that frustrated heavy electrons become superconducting in this compound .    </S>",
    "<S> generally , superconductivity due to a magnetic interaction competes with magnetic frustration , since no particular magnetic excitation for a superconducting attractive channel exists due to the frustration . </S>",
    "<S> the present study gives the first example of coexistence of magnetic frustration and superconductivity . </S>"
