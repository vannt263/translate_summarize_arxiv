    "microquasars ( mq ) are x - ray binary systems containing neutron stars or black holes that display relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "currently @xmath1  16 of these sources are known in our galaxy @xcite . since their discovery ,",
    "mqs have attracted the attention of the high energy astrophysics community because they are scaled - down versions of quasars , and allow the study of jet emission and formation on much shorter timescales .",
    "an evidence of tev emission has been obtained in the stellar - mass black hole mq cyg x-1 @xcite . a mq scenario",
    "@xcite @xcite has also been suggested for the recently detected tev sources ls 5039 @xcite and ls i + 61 303 @xcite though they could otherwise contain a young non - accreting pulsar and be powered by its rotation @xcite @xcite , as is the case for psr b1259 -63 @xcite .",
    "the detection of new mqs in the tev domain is therefore an important target for the present vhe gamma - ray observatories .",
    "we present the magic observations of four well - established galactic mqs : grs  1915 + 105 , cyg  x-1 , cyg  x-3 and ss  433 .",
    "these sources present unique properties concerning the non - thermal activity , the kinetic power present in their jets and the surrounding radiation / matter fields where gamma - rays could be generated both in leptonic and hadronic scenarios .",
    "the observations span four cycles of operations of the telescope from 2005 to 2008 , resulting in a variety of physical conditions ( regarding both orbital phases and spectral states ) in which vhe emission could be produced .    in sect .  2",
    ", we refer the magic telescope performance , the data reduction method and analysis technique applied . in sect .",
    "3 we present the data sample and the trigger strategy actually used in our observations .",
    "we report the resulting upper limits to the tev emission for each source , both for the whole sample and in a phase - folded basis . in sect .  4 .",
    "day - by - day analysis for transient emissions is also shown .",
    "5 is devoted to the discussion of the obtained results .",
    "the magic telescope @xcite is a new generation imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope at la palma , canary islands , spain ( 28.3@xmath2n , 17.8@xmath2w , 2240 m a.s.l . ) , successfully operating since the beginning of 2004 .",
    "the parabolically - shaped reflector , with its total mirror area of 236 m@xmath3 , allows magic to sample a part of the cherenkov light pool and focus it onto a multi - pixel camera , composed of 576 photomultipliers ( pmts ) .",
    "the output pulses of pmts are converted into optical signals , transmitted via optical fibers and digitized by a flash analogic to digital converter ( fadc ) system . in the first years of the magic operations , 300 msample / s fadcs ( siegen - fadcs )",
    "were used and it was upgraded to 2 gsample / s ultra - fast fadcs ( mux - fadcs ) in february 2007 , reducing contamination of night sky background and improving the reconstruction of the timing characteristics of the recorded images .",
    "the data analysis was performed using the standard magic analysis software .",
    "after the calibration @xcite and the image cleaning @xcite , the shower images were parametrized by the so - called hillas image parameters @xcite . in the case of data taken with the mux - fadcs , two additional parameters , namely the time gradient along the main shower axis and the time spread of the shower pixels ,",
    "were also computed @xcite .",
    "hadronic background suppression was achieved using the random forest ( rf ) method @xcite where for each event the so - called `` hadronness '' was computed based on the hillas and the time parameters .",
    "`` hadronness '' is a measure of the probability that the event is not gamma like .",
    "the rf method was also used for the energy estimation .",
    "the calculation of the number of excess events was performed in two different ways in the data before and after the installation of the mux - fadcs : in siegen - fadc data , disp method @xcite was used , while alpha method @xcite was used in mux - fadc data so that the timing parameters could have been used with less systematic uncertainties .",
    "data taken with significantly lower or higher trigger rate and with zenith angle larger than 50@xmath4 were rejected from the analysis . images with less than 200 ph.e . were discarded in order to assure the better background rejection and to avoid a systematic error in estimation of the background .",
    "the sensitivity of the telescope is estimated to be @xmath5 and 1.6% c.u . for 5@xmath6 detection in 50 hours of low zenith observations , with siegen - fadcs and mux - fadc , respectively @xcite @xcite .",
    "in 2005 and 2006 , the magic telescope observed grs 1915 + 105 and cyg x-3 for 14 hours each .",
    "these observations were triggered by the alerts on the source flaring state at radio frequencies sent by the ratan-600 telescope .",
    "on the other hand cyg x-1 was monitored between july and november 2006 for 46 hours and an evidence of signal at the level of 4.0 @xmath6 ( pre - trial ) was observed on september 24th , 2006 @xcite , when the source was in a _",
    "low / hard _ state and in coincidence with a hard x - ray flare . following this promising result , in 2007",
    ", we moved to a monitoring approach when the sources stayed in the _ low / hard _ state , characterized by the presence of steady relativistic jets where vhe emission could be produced .",
    "the spectral state was defined by using public soft and hard x - ray data from all sky monitor ( asm ) @xcite , hosted by the _",
    "x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) satellite , and from the burst alert telescope ( bat ) @xcite on board of _ swift _ , respectively . table [ triggertable ] shows the used trigger constraints on asm [ 2 - 12 kev ] and bat [ 15 - 50 kev ] fluxes for each of the observed sources .",
    "cyg x-3 was observed in 2007 for 28 hours ; grs 1915 + 105 for 14 hours in june 2007 , and cyg x-1 for 21 hours between july and november 2007 .",
    "ss  433 , was observed during the second half of august 2008 for 15 hours .",
    "the precession of the system can provoke a periodic ( p@xmath7  d ) attenuation of the vhe gamma - rays produced near the compact object .",
    "we observed the source following a predicted minimum of the opacity @xcite , avoiding also the eclipsing companion which cover the jet inner regions each @xmath8 d.    .trigger criteria for the microquasar observations in 2007 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in addition , the gamma - ray luminosities depend linearly on @xmath9 , the fraction of @xmath10 transferred to an accelerated e / p plasma , which is poorly constrained under a theoretical point of view .",
    "it could be much less efficient than expected , though it seems unlikely since acceleration is actually required to explain the persistent leptonic non - thermal emission at lower radio energies and probably at hard x - ray energies .",
    "interestingly , reynoso et al .",
    "@xcite have recently estimated the gamma - ray production in the hadronic jets of ss  433 . by using the hegra upper limit on the vhe flux from this system @xcite , @xmath9 for protons",
    "is constrained to be @xmath11 .",
    "these values assume however that hegra observations took place during unknown precessional phases @xmath12 . in order to account for the absorption of the gamma - ray photons , a @xmath12-averaged flux was used to derive the upper limit on @xmath9 .",
    "the current magic observations were performed during the lowest absorption phases . by comparing",
    "the proton - proton expected gamma - ray fluxes with our upper limits , a more stringent constraint of the hadronic @xmath13 can be derived .",
    "in addition to the steady emission , short - lived ejections can also occur in the transitions between the _ low / hard _ to the _ high / soft _ mq states , although the flaring behaviour is not limited to the state changes in sources like grs  1915  + 105 or cyg  x-3 , and is quite unpredictable .",
    "the kinetic power expelled in such episodes can be up to several times 10@xmath14 erg  s@xmath15 @xcite , producing intense radiation fluxes at all wavelengths .",
    "the appearance of outbursts at radio / ir wavelengths can be related to an increase of the activity also at vhe , although the time - delay between them could range from hours to days @xcite .",
    "the hard x - ray / tev correlation should provide more tightening constraints , since the emission could be produced by the same particle population or with similar timescale . however , the multifrequency correlation could be present only at some stages of the flare @xcite , rendering the triggering of tev outburst detections a quite difficult task",
    ". the non - detection of any transient signal could imply the high absorption present in the inner regions of these systems .",
    "the gamma - ray attenuation with the stellar and accretion disk photon fields could nonetheless distribute the luminosity to lower gamma - ray energies through electromagnetic cascades @xcite @xcite .",
    "this would increase the fluxes at ranges where observatories like _ fermi _ operate , providing the most simultaneous triggering of the putative vhe gamma - ray production in these systems .",
    "to conclude , steady emission from grs  1915  + 105 , cyg x-1 , cyg x-3 and ss  433 remains undetected at vhe , although an evidence of tev flare has been found in cyg x-1 .",
    "a complete , global description of the gamma - ray emission expected accounting both for leptonic and hadronic processes in the different sources and absorption conditions at each orbital phase in which they have been observed is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "nevertheless , some relevant theoretical predictions can already be tested , while further observations at vhe energies with present ground - based cherenkov telescopes and at lower gamma - ray energies with space missions like _ fermi _ , will provide new information on the physics present in these galactic vhe laboratories .",
    "we would like to thank the instituto de astrofisica de canarias for the excellent working conditions at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos in la palma . the support of the german bmbf and mpg , the italian infn and spanish micinn is gratefully acknowledged .",
