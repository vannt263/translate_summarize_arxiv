    "dark energy models , which assume an early epoch of inflation to generate the needed initial energy density fluctuations , do not predict the amplitude of these fluctuations . at present ,",
    "the most robust method to fix this amplitude , and hence the normalization of the model , is to compare model predictions of the large angular scale spatial anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation to what is observed . to this end",
    "we compute the model predictions as a function of the parameter @xmath5 and other cosmological parameters by following brax , martin , & riazuelo ( 2000 ) .",

    "more precisely , the fractional energy - density perturbation power spectrum we consider is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the magnitude of the coordinate spatial wavenumber , @xmath20 is the transfer function , and @xmath21 is the normalization amplitude defined in terms of the bardeen potential .    the cmb fractional temperature perturbation , @xmath22 , is expressed as a function of angular position , @xmath23 , on the sky via the spherical harmonic decomposition , @xmath24 the cmb spatial anisotropy in a gaussian model can then be characterized by the angular perturbation spectrum @xmath25 , defined in terms of the ensemble average , @xmath26 where the @xmath27 s are kronecker delta functions .",
    "the @xmath25 s used here were computed using the boltzmann transfer code of brax et al .",

    "2003a ) does affect the @xmath25 s on the large angular scales of interest here , the effect is not large and an accurate quantitative estimate awaits a better understanding of structure formation . at present",
    "there is not much observational motivation for the inclusion of tilt , gravity waves , or space curvature .",
    "the dark energy scalar field model we consider here is characterized by the potential energy density function @xmath28 where the constant @xmath29 has dimensions of mass raised to the power @xmath30 ( peebles & ratra 1988 ) . in the limit where the exponent @xmath5 approaches zero , the scalar field energy density is equivalent to a constant cosmological constant @xmath0 . here",

    "1 and 2 are a consequence of the interplay between the  usual \" ( fiducial cdm ) sachs - wolfe term and the  integrated \" sachs - wolfe term in the expression for the cmb spatial anisotropy ( see , e.g. , hu & dodelson 2002 for a review ) . the relative importance of these terms is determined by the values of @xmath32 and @xmath5 .",
    "( these terms are not easy to estimate analytically , and we can not trust the inaccurate xcdm approximation and must instead rely on numerical computations because these terms depend in complicated ways on the way in which @xmath10 changes from its value during the matter dominated epoch to its value at zero redshift . ) more precisely , in dark energy models the gravitational potential decays with time at late time , so at late time the gravitational potential and its time derivative are of opposite sign .",
    "consequently there is some anticorrelation between the usual and integrated sachs - wolfe terms .",
    "this anticorrelation more significantly reduces the @xmath25 s at larger @xmath32 ( where the integrated term is not too large ) and larger @xmath5 ( because the transition from matter dominance to dark energy dominance occurs earlier ) .",

    "the main changes relative to the analysis of gorski et al .",
