    "the important task of quantum mechanics is to find the exact bound - states solution of the schrdinger equation for certain potentials of physical interest . generally speaking",
    ", there are a few main traditional methods to study the exact solutions of quantum systems like the coulomb , the harmonic oscillator [ 1,2 ] , the pseudoharmonic [ 3,4 ] and the kratzer [ 4,5 ] potentials . additionally , in order to obtain the bound - states solutions of central potentials , one has to resort to numerical techniques or approximation schemes .",
    "for many of the quantum mechanical systems , most popular approximation methods such as shifted @xmath2 expansion [ 6 ] , perturbation theory [ 7 ] , path integral solution [ 8 ] , algebraic methods with the susyquantum mechanics method and the idea of shape invariance , further closely with the factorization mrthod [ 9 ] , exact quantization rule [ 10,11 ] , the conventional nikiforov and uvarov ( nu ) method  [ 12 - 25 ] .",
    "some of these methods have drawbacks in applications . although some other methods give simple relations for the eigenvalues , however , they lead to a very complicated relations for the eigenfunctions .",
    "the study of exact solutions of the schrdinger equation for a class of non - central potentials with a vector potential and a non - central scalar potential is of considerable interest in quantum chemistry [ 26 - 35 ] . in recent years",
    ", numerous studies [ 36 - 40 ] have been made in analyzing the bound states of an electron in a coulomb field with simultaneous presence of aharanov - bohm ( ab ) [ 41 ] field , and/or a magnetic dirac monopole [ 42 ] , and aharanov - bohm plus oscillator ( abo ) systems . in most of these studies ,",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are obtained by means of seperation of variables in spherical or other orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems .",
    "the path integral for particles moving in non - central potentials is evaluated to derive the energy spectrum of this system analytically [ 43 ] .",
    "in addition , the idea of susy and shape invariance is also used to obtain exact solutions of such non - central but seperable potentials [ 44 ] .",
    "very recently , the conventional nu method has been used to give a clear recipe of how to obtain an explicit exact bound - states solutions for the energy eigenvalues and their corresponding wave functions in terms of orthogonal polynomials for a class of non - central potentials [ 45 ] .",
    "recently , chen and dong [ 46 ] found a new ring - shaped potential and obtained the exact solution of the schrdinger equation for the coulomb potential plus this new ring - shaped potential which has possible applications to ring - shaped organic molecules like cyclic polyenes and benzene .",
    "recently , cheng and dai [ 47 ] , proposed a new potential consisting from the modified kratzer s potential [ 48 ] plus the new proposed ring - shaped potential in [ 46 ] .",
    "they have presented the energy eigenvalues for this proposed exactly - solvable non - central potential in three dimensional @xmath3i.e .",
    ", @xmath4-schrdinger equation through the nu method .",
    "the two quantum systems solved by refs [ 46,47 ] are closely relevant to each other as they deal with a coulombic field interaction except for a slight additional centrifugal potential barrier acts as a repulsive core which is for any arbitrary angular momentum @xmath5 prevents collapse of the system in any dimensional space due to the slight perturbation to the original angular momentum barrier . in a very recent work [ 49 ] ,",
    "we have given a clear recipe of how to obtain analytically the exact energy eigenvalues and the corresponding wave functions of the @xmath0-dimensional space schrdinger equation with the proposed potential in [ 47 ] by means of the conventional nu method .",
    "the conventional nikiforov - uvarov ( @xmath6 ) method [ 12 ] , which received much interest in recent years , has been introduced for solving schrdinger equation [ 13 - 21 ] , klein - gordon [ 22,23 ] , dirac [ 24 ] and salpeter [ 25 ] equations .",
    "the purpose of this work is to follow parallel solution to [ 47 ] and give exact complete solutions to the @xmath0-dimensional schrdinger equation with pseudo - coulomb potential plus ring - shaped potential , a coulombic - like potential with an additional centrifugal barrier , for any arbitrary @xmath7-states using the conventional nikiforov - uvarov method .",
    "for some appropriate choices of parameters , the obtained expressions of energy eigenvalues and their corresponding wave functions for this alternative form of the potential coincide with the @xmath0-@xmath8ensional results given in [ 49 ] and with the three - dimensions results given in [ 47 ] in the limiting case of @xmath9    this work is organized as follows : in section [ bc ] , we shall briefly introduce the basic concepts of the nu method .",
    "section [ es ] is mainly devoted to the exact solution of the schrdinger equation in @xmath0-dimensions for this quantum system by means of the @xmath6 method .",
    "finally , the relevant results are discussed in section [ rac ] .",
    "the nu method is based on reducing the second - order differential equation to a generalized equation of hypergeometric type [ 12 ] . in this sense , the schrdinger equation , after employing an appropriate coordinate transformation @xmath10 transforms to the following form : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are polynomials , at most of second - degree , and @xmath14 is a first - degree polynomial . using a wave function , @xmath15 of  the simple ansatz :    @xmath16    reduces ( 1 ) into an equation of a hypergeometric type    @xmath17    where    @xmath18    @xmath19    and @xmath20 is a parameter defined as @xmath21 the polynomial @xmath22 with the parameter @xmath23 and prime factors show the differentials at first degree be negative .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that @xmath20 or @xmath24 are obtained from a particular solution of the form @xmath25 which is a polynomial of degree @xmath26 further , the other part @xmath27 of the wave function ( 2 ) is the hypergeometric - type function whose polynomial solutions are given by rodrigues relation    @xmath28 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the normalization constant and the weight function @xmath30 must satisfy the condition [ 12 ]    @xmath31    the function @xmath32 and the parameter @xmath20 are defined as    @xmath33    @xmath34    in principle , since @xmath35 has to be a polynomial of degree at most one , the expression under the square root sign in ( 9 ) can be arranged to be the square of a polynomial of first degree [ 12 ] .",
    "this is possible only if its discriminant is zero . in this case ,",
    "an equation for @xmath36 is obtained . after solving this equation , the obtained values of @xmath36",
    "are substituted in ( 9 ) .",
    "in addition , by comparing equations ( 6 ) and ( 10 ) , we obtain the energy eigenvalues .",
    "the pseudo - coulomb potential plus ring - shaped potential in spherical coordinates is defined as [ 47 ]    @xmath37    where @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 are positive real constants .",
    "the potential in ( 11 ) coincides with the potential introduced by cheng - dai [ 47 ] if the parameters take their proper values and also turns to be the modified kratzer potential in the limiting case of @xmath41 [ 48]@xmath42 in fact the energy spectrum for this potential can be obtained directly by considering it as special case of the general non - central seperable potentials [ 45 ] .",
    "our aim is to derive analytically the energy spectrum for a moving particle in the presence of a potential ( 11 ) in a very simple way .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional space schrdinger equation in spherical polar coordinates written for potential ( 11 ) takes the form [ 1,6 ]    @xmath43 \\psi ( r,\\theta , \\varphi ) \\ ] ] @xmath44 \\psi ( r,\\theta , \\varphi ) = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 being the reduced mass of the two particles and @xmath46 being the total wave function separated as follows    @xmath47    on substituting equation ( 13 ) into ( 12 ) leads to a set of second - order differential equations : @xmath48    @xmath49 h(\\theta ) = 0,\\ ] ]    @xmath50 r(r)+\\frac{2\\mu } { \\hbar ^{2}}\\left [ e+\\frac{a}{r}-\\frac{b}{r^{2}}-c\\right ] r(r)=0.\\ ] ]    the solution in ( 16 ) is periodic and must satisfy the period boundary condition @xmath51 from which we obtain @xmath52 further , equation ( 15 ) representing the angular wave equation takes the simple form @xmath53 h(\\theta ) = 0,\\ ] ] which has already been solved before in our previous work [ 49 ] .",
    "we present the final results for the angular part of the wave function as @xmath54 where @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 on the other hand , we are left to solve equation ( 16 ) .",
    "after lengthy , but straightforward , calculations , equation ( 16 ) , representing the radial wave equation can be rewritten as [ 6 ] : @xmath58 g(r)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 the two particles in equation ( 18 ) interacting via coulombic - like field have a slight change in the angular momentum barrier acts as a repulsive core which for any arbitrary @xmath5 prevents collapse of the system in any space dimension due to the additional centrifugal potential barrier .",
    "thus , equation ( 23 ) has to be solved by using the nu method in the next subsection .",
    "the aim of this subsection is to solve the problem with a different radial separation function @xmath60 in any arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we now study the bound - states ( real ) solution @xmath61 of equation ( 23 ) . letting @xmath62 and substituting these expressions in equation ( 23 ) ,",
    "one gets @xmath63 to apply the conventional nu - method , equation ( 26 ) is compared with ( 1 ) and the following expressions are obtained    @xmath64    substituting the above expressions into equation ( 9 ) gives    @xmath65    according to this conventional method , the expression in the square root be the square of a polynomial .",
    "thus , the two roots @xmath36 can be readily obtained as    @xmath66    in view of that , we arrive at the following four possible functions of @xmath67@xmath68 & \\text{\\ for } k_{1}=\\alpha + \\varepsilon \\sqrt{4\\gamma + 1 } , \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}-\\left [ \\varepsilon r+\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{4\\gamma + 1}\\right ] & \\text{\\ for } k_{1}=\\alpha + \\varepsilon \\sqrt{4\\gamma + 1 } , \\\\",
    "\\frac{1}{2}+\\left [ \\varepsilon r-\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{4\\gamma + 1}\\right ] & \\text{\\ for } k_{2}=\\alpha -\\varepsilon \\sqrt{4\\gamma + 1 } , \\\\",
    "\\frac{1}{2}-\\left [ \\varepsilon r-\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{4\\gamma + 1}\\right ] & \\text{\\ for } k_{2}=\\alpha -\\varepsilon \\sqrt{4\\gamma + 1}. \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the correct value of @xmath69 is chosen such that the function @xmath70 given by equation ( 5 ) will have negative derivative [ 12 ] .",
    "so we can select the physical values to be    @xmath71 , \\ ] ]    which yield @xmath72 using equations ( 6 ) and ( 10 ) , the following expressions for @xmath20 are obtained , respectively ,    @xmath73    @xmath74    so we can obtain the energy eigenvalues as    @xmath75    where    @xmath76    with @xmath7 defined in ( 21 ) .",
    "therefore , the final energy spectra in equation ( 35 ) take the following coulombic - like form [ 7 ] @xmath77 where    @xmath78 , \\ ] ]    is simply obtained by means of substituting equation ( 36 ) into ( 35 ) .",
    "\\(i ) if @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( modified kratzer potential - plus - ring - shaped potential ) , the equation ( 35 ) , with the help of equation ( 36 ) , is transformed into the following form    @xmath83    and it is consistent with ref .",
    "[ 47 ] .",
    "\\(ii ) if @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath84 and @xmath41 ( modified kratzer potential)@xmath85 the equation ( 35 ) is transformed into the form    @xmath86    and it is consistent with ref . [ 48 ] .",
    "\\(iii ) if @xmath79 @xmath87 and @xmath88 the equation ( 35 ) is transformed into the form    @xmath89    and it is consistent with ref . [ 49 ] .",

    "let us now turn attention to find the radial wavefunctions for this potential . using @xmath95 @xmath69 and @xmath96 in equations ( 4 ) and ( 8)",
    ", we find @xmath97    @xmath98    then from equation ( 7 ) , we obtain    @xmath99    and the wave function @xmath60 can be written in the form of the generalized laguerre polynomials as    @xmath100    where    @xmath101 .\\ ] ]    finally , the radial wave functions of the schrdinger equation are obtained @xmath102 where    @xmath103    with @xmath104 is given in equation ( 38 ) and @xmath105 is the normalization constant to be determined below .",
    "using the normalization condition , @xmath106 and the orthogonality relation of the generalized laguerre polynomials , @xmath107 ^{2}dz=\\frac{(2n+\\eta + 1)(n+\\eta ) ! } { n!},$ ] we have    @xmath108    letting @xmath82 and @xmath109 the equation ( 48 ) transforms into equation ( 20 ) in ref.[46 ] .",
    "therefore , we may express the normalized total wave functions as    @xmath110 @xmath111",
    "in this paper , the schrdinger equation in any arbitrary dimensions has been solved for its exact bound - states with a a pseudo - coulomb potential plus ring - shaped potential by means of a simple conventional nu method .",
    "the analytical expressions for the total energy levels of this system is found to be different from the results obtained for the modified kratzer s potential in [ 48 ] and also more general than the one obtained recently in @xmath0-dimensions [ 49 ] .",
    "hence , the noncentral potentials treated in [ 45 ] can be introduced as perturbation to the central potentials by adjusting the strength of the coupling constant @xmath40 in the non - central part in terms of the coupling constants of the central part .",
    "in addition , the angular part , the radial part and then the total wave functions are also found .",
    "thus , the schrdinger equation with a new non - central but seperable potential has also been studied ( cf .",
    "[ 45,49]and the references therein ) .",
    "this method is very simple and useful in solving other complicated systems analytically without given a restiction conditions on the solution of some quantum systems as the case in the other models . finally , we point out that these exact results obtained for this new proposed form of the potential ( 11 ) may have some interesting applications in the study of different quantum mechanical systems , atomic and molecular physics .",
