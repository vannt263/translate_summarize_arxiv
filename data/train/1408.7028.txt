    "our ability to measure the spin of a black hole ( bh ) has increased substantially over the last decade . apart from exploring a fundamental prediction concerning orbits around spinning compact objects",
    ", spin measurements may hold the key to understanding how relativistic jets are launched .",
    "as such , spin is a very important quantity to measure .",
    "it is also a very difficult quantity to measure , because in order to do so one must observe the effects that the bh has on nearby material in an accretion disk , and infer information indirectly about the hole itself .    currently , two reliable methods are used to measure the spins of accreting black holes using the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the first is the continuum fitting method ( zhang , cui , & chen 1997 ; shafee et al .",
    "2006 ; mcclintock et al . 2006 ; etc . ) . in this method , one fits spectra with models that estimate an inner radius of the disk , which is assumed to exist at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "the radius of the isco is determined by the spin and mass , and thus the spin can be determined , if the mass is already known .",
    "the distance to the source and the inclination of the inner disk must also be known when performing this method in order to infer the inner radius of the disk from the observed flux .",
    "the mass , distance , and binary inclination can be reliably measured via independant methods ( some examples of such methods applied to various black hole systems can be found in miller - jones et al . 2009 ; gelino et al . 2001 ; orosz et al .",
    "however in cases where the spin vector of the black hole is misaligned with the binary s orbital angular momentum , the inclination of the inner disk may be misaligned with the orbital inclination since it aligns instead with the spin of the black hole ( bardeen & petterson 1975 ) .    the other method for measuring black hole spin using the x - ray spectrum is by modeling spectral features produced via reflection from material in the inner disk ( tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ; miller et al . 2002 ; miller et al . 2004",
    "; for a comprehensive review , see reynolds 2013 ) .",
    "in particular , one examines asymetric blurring of the iron k shell emission lines caused by the strong gravity and by doppler shifts from orbits within that potential .",
    "additionally , other features are produced by reflection that one must account for properly in order to declare their measurement credible .",
    "use of this method has led to spin measurements for both supermassive black holes and bhbs because it does not necessitate a strong disk component to be observed in the x - rays .",
    "this method also does not require prior constraints on the mass or distance , since the shape of the line is determined by the metric ( reynolds 2013 ) .",
    "additionally , the observed shape of the line is affected by the inclination of the inner disk with respect to the observer in such a way that the inner disk inclination can be robustly constrained using this method ( reynolds 2013 ) .    for bhbs",
    ", both methods have found evidence for both extreme and moderate spins . generally , when applied to the same sources , they provide results that are in agreement ( miller et al . 2011 ) .",
    "however there remain two cases for which such an agreement is not found : gro j1655 - 40 and 4u 1543 - 47 ( reynolds 2013 ) .",
    "resolving the discrepancy for gro j1655 - 40 is difficult because the spectrum shows evidence of strong absorption by winds which complicates modeling of the continuum spectrum , and possible strong misalignment between the binary ( greene et al .",
    "2001 ) , the jet ( maccarone 2002 ) , and possibly the inner disk as well ( reis et al . 2009 ) .",
    "however , 4u 1543 - 47 shows very little evidence for the same complications .",
    "furthermore , the discrepancy is @xmath2 for 4u 1543 - 47 , but only @xmath3 for gro j1655 - 40 , making resolving the disagreement in 4u 1543 - 475 the more pressing concern .",
    "we note that both past work and recent studies have demonstrated the potential for x - ray timing to measure black hole spin , if observations can eventually determine the mechanism for quasi - period oscillations ( strohmayer 2001 ; wagoner 2012 ; motta et al . 2014a , b ; bambi et al .",
    "2014 ; dexter and blaes 2014 ) .    in this work",
    ", we shall examine spectra obtained during the 2002 outburst of 4u 1543 - 47 in an attempt to measure its spin .",
    "we use models that combine disk reflection and continuum fitting .",
    "our data reduction and data selection procedures are described in section 2 .",
    "our analysis methods and results are presented in section 3 .",
    "we discuss these results in section 4 , and list our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "for our analysis , we focused on the 49 rxte pointed observations reported in park et al .",
    "the data we consider are the _ rxte _ pca standard products from the heasarc archive .",
    "these products contain the source spectra , background spectra , and the necessary response files .",
    "we did not use hexte data in our analysis , because the model that we use ( _ kerrbb2 _ , see section 3 ) is designed for use with rxte / pca spectra ( the model calls a library and depends on the pca response to deduce the spectral hardening ) , and is thus incompatible with hexte data . as in park et al .",
    ", we added a 0.5% systematic error to all channels using the ftool `` grppha '' .",
    "all subsequent analysis was performed using xspec version 12.8.1 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "owing to calibration uncertainties , and due to the intrinsic softness of the source , we limited our analysis to the energy range 2.9 - 25.0 kev ( park et al .",
    "2004 ) .    as stated earlier , when measuring bh spin via spectral fitting , one assumes that the inner radius of an accretion disk coincides with the isco .",
    "it has been postulated that this assumption holds when an outburst is observed to be in the `` thermal dominant '' or high / soft state . by definition ,",
    "emission in this state is predominantly thermal radiation from the disk ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) , although a weak nonthermal component is usually observed also . in order to limit our analysis to spectra in this state",
    ", we excluded any spectra which have a ratio @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the bolometric disk flux and @xmath6 is the 2.9 - 25.0 kev power - law flux .",
    "the flux values listed in park et al .",
    "( 2004 ) were used to make these selections",
    ".    additionally , mcclintock et al . ( 2006 ) found that spectra used to measure spin via continuum fitting should not imply luminosities that exceed 30% of the eddington limit , since otherwise the disks become geometrically thick and may have nonzero torques at their inner boundary .",
    "we have thus excluded any spectra which have @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 were calculated from @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "after exclusions , we are left with 15 viable observations for analysis .",
    "park et al . ( 2004 ) used a simple model for the x - ray continuum of 4u 1543 - 47 , consisting of a multicolor disk blackbody and a power - law , and found that two additional components were required : a `` smeared absorption edge '' ( modeled using _ smedge _ ) and a relativistically broadened fe k@xmath10 line ( fitted with a laor model ( laor 1991 ) ) .",
    "this implies the existance of relativistically blurred reflection features throughout the entirety of their observations . in order to self - consistently model absorption edges , and emission features present in the reflected spectrum",
    ", we used _ reflionx _",
    "( ross & fabian 2005 ) .",
    "relativistic blurring was produced by convolving _ reflionx _ with _",
    "relconv _ ( dauser et al . 2010 ) .",

    "kerrbb2 _ and _ simpl _ ( mcclintock et al .",

    "we allowed for both self - irradiation of the disk and limb - darkening , and enforced the zero - torque boundary condition for the inner edge of the disk .",
    "the photon indices of _ simpl _ and _ reflionx _ were linked in order for the model to be self - consistent , and the ionization parameter ( @xmath15 ) , scattering fraction ( @xmath16 ) and reflection normalization ( @xmath17 ) were allowed to vary . in _ relconv _ , the spin was linked to that from _ kerrbb2 _ unless stated otherwise , and both emissivity indices were fixed at @xmath18 .",
    "the other parameters of _ relconv _ were fixed at their default values ( with the exception of the inclination , which we examine in the following paragraphs ) .",

    "( 2004 ) and shafee et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "spin constraints found via continuum - fitting also require that the inclination is fixed or constrained , since effects related to the potential compete with inclination - dependent doppler effects .",

    "2006 , mcclintock et al .",
    "2006 , etc . )",
    ", the inclination of the inner disk is assumed to be equivalent to the binary inclination .",
    "however , in a number of sources that have independant measurements of the inner disk inclination , usually via radio observations of a superluminal jet ( e.g. v4641 sgr , gro j1655 - 40 ) , the inner disk inclinations appear to be misaligned with the orbital plane of the binary . furthermore , maccarone et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find that the timescale in which the black hole angular momentum will allign with the orbital angular momentum in such systems can be a substantial fraction of the lifetime of the binary .",

    "we have performed a thorough examination of rxte data of the 2002 outburst of the soft x - ray transient 4u 1543 - 74 . using a combination of continuum - fitting , and disk reflection modeling , we have measured the spin to be @xmath1 .",
    "prior works measuring the spin of 4u 1543 - 74 which used both of these methods separately had found conflicting values of @xmath22 ( 0.75 - 0.85 by shafee et al .",
    "2006 ; @xmath111 by miller et al .",
    "our measured spin is lower than that obtained by shafee et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , primarily because they assumed that the binary inclination is equal to the inclination of the disk .",
    "we instead used the iron line to constrain the inclination of the disk , since there is evidence of potential misalignment of varying degrees in other systems , and since the data clearly favor a higher inclination when self - consistent reflection features are considered .",
    "additionally , our model uses _ simpl _ rather than a power - law , which avoids a systematic overestimate of the spin due to the divergence of a power - law at low energy ( see e.g. steiner et al .",
    "last , our model replaces the _ edge _ and _ smedge _ functions adopted by shafee et al .",
    "( 2006 ) with newer model components that treat absorption and emission features self - consistently while also properly taking relativistic effects into account .",
    "[ fig:1543contours ]    our measurement is consistent with that from miller et al .",
    "our method differs from this prior work in that we require the normalization of _ kerrbb _ to be fixed to 1 , and we use a different combination of models to explain the reflected continuum .",
    "we also examine a different set of observations , focusing specifically on spectra which meet all the criteria necessary for use of the continuum fitting method .",

    "kerrbb2 _ which provides its own method of determining the value of @xmath11 to input to _",
    "kerrbb_.    to make a direct comparison , we decided to fit spectra for 16 evenly spaced values of @xmath23 and 31 evenly spaced values of @xmath22 , for the range @xmath112 and @xmath113 using the _ steppar _ feature in xspec ( this range was refined from our original range , which included the binary inclination @xmath114 and stepped @xmath22 between 0 and 0.998 ) . in all of these fits , values of @xmath115 and @xmath116 were allowed to vary within the range allowed by our grid , and were jointly determined by all 15 spectra .",
    "the resulting contours of @xmath13 are shown in figure  [ fig:1543contours ] .",
    "it is clear that when the mass and distance are allowed to vary , the best - fitting spin is equivalent to that determined by miller et al .",
