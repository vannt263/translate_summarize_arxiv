    "the seminal work of loss and divincenzo@xcite introduced the notion of using individual electrons trapped in gate - defined quantum dots to encode quantum information , an idea which has since burgeoned into a family of promising architectures for quantum computing @xcite .",
    "an early theoretical realisation was that a single qubit encoded in three electron spins could be universally controlled using exchange couplings alone @xcite , which removes any requirement for individually addressable electron spin resonance or magnetic field gradients .",
    "crucially , since exchange couplings in semiconductor experiments are controllable using gate voltages , this allows all qubit operations to be performed electronically ; an attractive feature in experimental implementations .",
    "single - qubit operations for the so - called `` exchange - only '' qubit have been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "pulse sequences are known for single - qubit gates that simultaneously correct leakage errors and other sources of noise  @xcite . proposed two - qubit gates for the exchange - only qubit either involve capacitive coupling @xcite or exchange - coupling @xcite . since exchange coupling is usually much larger than capacitive coupling , exchange gates are usually faster , but come at the cost of requiring complicated pulse sequences in order to echo away the unwanted spin - flip transitions that occur as a side - effect and cause leakage errors .",
    "the first such pulse sequence @xcite that effected a cnot required 19 exchange pulses in 13 timesteps , and was found using a numerical search .",
    "since then , robust numerical searches have found improved pulse sequences that are robust against more sources of decoherence and/or reduce the number of gate operations @xcite .    a recent alternative to the `` exchange - only '' qubit is the `` resonant - exchange qubit '' @xcite , which encodes qubits in the interaction picture with respect to significant exchange coupling between the three dots .",
    "universal single qubit operations are effected using rf gate pulses to the electrodes controlling the exchange couplings .",
    "this qubit has been shown both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite to have several improved properties , including first - order insensitivity to charge fluctuations and reduced leakage error due to nuclear field fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in addition , taylor et al . @xcite have shown that you can perform two - qubit gates between these qubits using charge dipole interactions , while we have suggested an alternative of using simple exchange pulses between nearby qubits @xcite .    in this earlier work @xcite , we showed that a two - qubit cphase gate can be implemented using a single exchange pulse between the constituent quantum dots of neighbouring qubits ( shown schematically in figure [ fig : physical - configurations ] ) .",
    "rapid high - fidelity gate operation is in principle made possible by energetically suppressing the spin - flip transitions that lead to leakage .",
    "this method of effecting a two - qubit gate contrasted with the more conventional approach of long and complicated pulse sequences , and is similar to our earlier proposal for singlet - triplet qubits @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to extend our previous results by considering higher - order analysis , adiabatic pulse profiles , the effect of noise , and the performance of our gate in physically motivated simulations that include noise . in section [ sec : resonant - exchange - qubits ] we briefly review single - qubit resonant - exchange qubit operations , in section [ sec : our - two - qubit ] we review our two - qubit gates , in section [ sec : gate - characterisation ] we formally characterise our two - qubit gate in the butterfly geometry , in section [ sec : alternative - geometries ] we briefly consider other geometries , and in section [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude .    in this work",
    "we set @xmath0 , meaning that energies are interchangeable with angular frequencies .",
    "a resonant exchange qubit is a triple - dot system operating deep in the ( 1,1,1 ) charge state ( each dot almost surely confines a single electron ) .",
    "a large magnetic field is applied along the @xmath1-axis , zeeman splitting the @xmath2 spin states according to the z - projection of their total spins : @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the effective zeeman splitting of an electron subject to the global magnetic field .",
    "note that we have absorbed the g - factor ( up to its sign ) into our definition of @xmath4 .",
    "the logical states of the qubit are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which both have total spin @xmath7 with z - projection of @xmath8 .",
    "the remainder of the eight - dimensional hilbert space describes non - logical states , the spanning eigenstates of which are completed for the energy eigenbasis in table [ tab : qubit - states ] .",
    "these qubits are operated with large intra - qubit exchange couplings @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with oscillatory modulations around @xmath11 providing single qubit control @xcite .",
    "this is depicted and described in more detail in figure [ fig : single - qubit - control ] .",
    "and @xmath10 couplings , states rotate about the same axes as those of the rotations indicated in green and red respectively . if both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are equal to @xmath12 , states rotate about the @xmath1 axis as indicated by the emboldened blue rotation . pulses involving different @xmath9 and @xmath10 couplings allow arbitrary rotations , and hence provide universal single qubit control . as these intra - qubit couplings are controllable using gate voltages , this allows for universal electronic control of qubits.[fig : single - qubit - control ] ]    intra - qubit exchange couplings are in turn controlled by detuning the voltages defining the quantum dots ( which we parametrise as @xmath13 ) .",
    "this allows for complete electronic control of qubits , which potentially simplifies experimental implementation . in several gaas singlet - triplet qubit experiments",
    "@xcite , an exponential ansatz @xmath14 has been found to be a good phenomenological fit to experimental data over a wide range of interesting values of @xmath13 , and so we adopt it in this work .",
    ".energy eigenstates of a single resonant exchange qubit , sorted by @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the total angular momentum quantum number of the three electron spins and @xmath15 is the z - component of the total angular momentum .",
    "@xmath17 is the energy level splitting due to exchange coupling , and @xmath4 is the splitting of an electron subject to the large transverse global field .",
    "each eigenstate with a negative subscript has their constituent spins flipped relative to the corresponding unsubscripted state.[tab : qubit - states ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section we describe how the effective hamiltonian of equations 1 and 2 in the main text is lifted from perturbation theory , the procedure for which follows standard practice @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that , in the limit that inter - qubit coupling @xmath18 is small compared to intra - qubit coupling @xmath12 , the evolution of the logical subspace in which we are interested should be well - approximated by low - order terms in a perturbation expansion around @xmath19 ; from which considerable insight might be gained into qubit dynamics .    to generate the effective hamiltonian for a given geometry , we perturb the hamiltonian describing the two decoupled resonant exchange qubits with the hamiltonian describing the two - qubit coupling of that geometry , to first order in a rayleigh - schroedinger perturbation expansion .",
    "we then construct the effective hamiltonian using the resulting energies @xmath20 and eigenvectors @xmath21 that adiabatically map to the logical states using @xmath22 .",
    "this algorithm explicitly disregards any leakage operations , but captures the dominant dynamics on the logical subspace .",
    "the result is a diagonal hamiltonian , except where the original logical states were degenerate .    for our two resonant exchange qubit system ,",
    "in which the @xmath23 and @xmath24 states are degenerate ( shown in figure 3 of the main text ) , this results in a block - diagonal hamiltonian when written in the basis @xmath25 .",
    "we explicitly compute the effective hamiltonians for the geometries shown in figure 2 of the main text ; that is , the linear , butterfly and rectangular geometries respectively .",
    "we also explicitly compute the coefficients of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , which are then used to populate table ii of the main text .",
    "@xmath30\\ ] ]    @xmath31\\ ] ]       @xmath32\\ ] ]    @xmath33\\ ] ]       @xmath34\\ ] ]    @xmath35\\ ] ]    note that to recover the provided coefficients in table ii of the main text , we assume that all inter - qubit couplings ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) are equal to @xmath18 .",
    "as computed using the `` hybrid '' method described in the text , which is our best approach for maximising the fidelity of gate operations .",
    "@xmath39 is defined as in the text , and plotted here for @xmath40 . in ( b ) we plot the relative difference @xmath41 of the other methods described in the text , namely `` adiabatic '' ( green dashed ) and `` first order '' ( red dotted ) methods , to the `` hybrid '' estimate ( blue solid ) .",
    "the plots share the same x axis , which is the ratio of intra - qubit coupling to inter - qubit coupling @xmath42 .",
    "note that the first order approximation consistently underestimates the phase accrual rate , and so overestimates the gate time .",
    "while an adiabatic phase estimation does better , it ends up underestimating the phase due to the importance of evolution off the logical subspace for large enough @xmath18.[fig : timing - errors ] ]    as mentioned in section iva , over- or under - estimating the ideal gate time @xmath43 leads to over- or under - accrual of two - qubit phase , resulting in poor gate fidelities .",
    "in particular , using a first order approximation neglects higher order terms that give rise to convex non - linearity in @xmath44 , and so consistently exaggerates gate times . in this section , we describe the method by which we obtain accurate timing estimates for use in the simulations of the main text .",
    "there are two methods that one might employ to find an estimate of @xmath43 that includes high order perturbations .",
    "one can make the assumption that evolution is perfectly adiabatic , solve for the eigenvalues at different values of inter - qubit coupling @xmath18 , and thus infer the two - qubit phase accumulation rate @xmath45 ; or , alternatively , one can locally maximise the gate fidelity over gate times .",
    "the first method works well for small values of @xmath42 ( where the adiabatic approximation make sense ) , and the second method works well for larger values of @xmath42 ( where gate times are shorter , and numerical integration has less time to accumulate error ) .",
    "we therefore use a hybrid approach that works well across all values of @xmath42 : for @xmath46 , we use the adiabatic approach , and for @xmath47 we use the adiabatic approach to seed a numerical optimisation of gate fidelity over gate times .    as noted in the main text , the non - linearity of @xmath44 means that we must repeat this estimation process for each pulse shape considered . as the dynamics of our ( noiseless ) two - qubit system is determined by the ratio of @xmath42 , given a particular pulse shape , we need only optimise over the ratio of the two physical degrees of freedom , rather than both .",
    "we therefore proxy the optimisation of @xmath48 for any given pulse shape by optimisations over the single parameter function @xmath49 . in practice",
    "we fix a value of @xmath50 , and vary @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath43 can be recovered from @xmath51 using : @xmath52 the gate time for maximum fidelity @xmath53 for the butterfly configuration using a sinusoidal adiabatic pulse profile is shown in figure [ fig : timing - errors ] , along with the relative error of the first order and adiabatic estimations .",
    "we note that the first order approximation consistently underestimates the phase accrual rate , and so overestimates the gate time .",
    "while an adiabatic phase estimation does better at first , it ends up underestimating the phase due to the importance of evolution off the logical subspace for large enough @xmath18 .",
    "simulations involving the overhauser field modelled as described in the main text requires averaging over a multi - variate normal distribution in 6 variables ( 11 if dc charge noise is also considered ) . while a naive monte - carlo simulation that samples the local overhauser field contribution for each dot will converge eventually , we speed up the convergence by instead sampling preferentially from linear combinations of local overhauser contributions that appear at lower order in perturbation theory .    inspired by perturbation theory , we form a spanning basis for the magnetic fields :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 ( with @xmath56 $ ] ) is the z - component of the overhauser field at dot @xmath57 . we learn from perturbation theory that @xmath58 and @xmath59 first contribute at zeroth order in perturbation theory , @xmath60 and @xmath61 at first order , and @xmath62 at fourth order . as @xmath63 is a global field , it does not contribute .",
    "the higher the order at which the terms contribute , the more significant that term is to the dynamics of the qubit system .",
    "it makes sense , therefore , to sample lower order terms more often .",
    "technically , one should weight each term roughly as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the order at which the term appears in perturbation theory .",
    "we found it simpler , however , to use a conservative ratio of @xmath66 between terms of different order .",
    "that is , for each 100 simulations , we sample @xmath58 and @xmath59 100 times , @xmath60 and @xmath61 20 times , and @xmath62 4 times .",
    "as the terms of the new basis are linear compositions of the @xmath55 terms , the random variable associated with each term will differ from the underlying local field fluctuations .",
    "in particular , if each @xmath67 , then the relevant terms of new basis will be sampled from the distributions : @xmath68",
    "perturbation theory provides the insight that beyond first order the overhauser field cross - couples with charge noise in @xmath18 at second order and above .",
    "this allows the overhauser field to contribute non - trivially to two - qubit phases .",
    "for example , the two - qubit phase accumulation rate to second order for the butterfly configuration is given by : @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and where the coloured and starred line is the effect of cross - coupling .",
    "the intuition is that as @xmath42 and the @xmath71 increase , the greater the two - qubit cross - coupling error . for the useful range of @xmath42 values , and",
    "the experimentally inspired values of @xmath71 used in the main text , the effect of this cross - coupling is negligible ."
