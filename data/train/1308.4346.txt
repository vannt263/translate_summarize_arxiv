    "in this paper we show a kind of atomic decomposition for an integral function @xmath9 if @xmath10 is a bounded domain which can be written as the union of a countable collection of domains @xmath11 with certain properties .",
    "this result is based on a decomposition developed by bogovskii in @xcite , where @xmath12 is finite .",

    "let us introduce the divergence problem for a bounded domain @xmath18 .",
    "given @xmath19 , with vanishing mean value and @xmath20 , the divergence problem deals with the existence of a solution @xmath21 in the sobolev space @xmath22 of @xmath7 satisfying @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the differential matrix of @xmath21 .",
    "this problem has been widely studied and it has many applications , for example , in the particular case @xmath25 , it is fundamental for the variational analysis of the stokes equations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is also well known for its relation with some inequalities such as korn and sobolev poincar .",
    "consequently , several methods have been developed to prove the existence of a solution of @xmath7 satisfying ( [ introduction div ] ) under different assumptions on the domain ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , this result fails if @xmath10 has an external cusp or arbitrarily narrow  corridors \" , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of solutions of the divergence problem holds in some of these  bad \" domains if we consider weighted sobolev spaces with an estimate weaker than ( [ introduction div ] ) .",
    "a similar analysis can be done for its related results .",
    "since the non - existence of standard solutions arises because of the bad behavior of the boundary , it seems natural to work with weights involving the distance to the boundary of @xmath10 or a subset of it .",
    "the following are some papers considering the divergence problem or related results in weighted sobolev spaces @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    as we mentioned before there are many different approaches to this problem .",
    "in the present paper , as it was done in @xcite and @xcite , we use a decomposition of the function @xmath13 in @xmath7 to generalize results valid on simple domains , such as rectangles or star - shaped domains , to more general cases .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in section [ preliminaries ] , we include some notations and preliminary results . in section [ decompositiontechnique ]",
    ", we show the main result of this paper , a decomposition technique for integrable functions defined over a bounded domain @xmath10 which is written as the union of a collection of subdomains @xmath26 with some properties .",
    "the set @xmath12 is required to have a certain partial order structure . in the following sections we include three different applications of the decomposition developed in section [ decompositiontechnique ] .",
    "these sections can be independently read . in section [ general domains ] , we show the existence of a weighted right inverse of the divergence operator on arbitrary bounded domains . in sections [ cuspidal domains ] and [ holder ] ,",
    "we prove the existence of a solution of the divergence problem and the well - posedness of the stokes equations on some domains with an external cusp arbitrarily narrow and on bounded hlder-@xmath8 domains in @xmath27 .",
    "the weights in these two final sections are more specific than the one used in section [ general domains ] .",
    "more precisely , the weights are related to the distance to the cusp and to the distance to the boundary of the domain respectively .",
    "let @xmath18 be a bounded domain . given a measurable positive function @xmath28 we denote with @xmath29 the weighted space with norm @xmath30 and with @xmath31 the weighted sobolev space defined as the closure of @xmath32 with norm @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the differential matrix of @xmath35 .",
    "observe that the seminorm @xmath36 results a norm in the trace zero space .",
    "we say that @xmath10 satisfies @xmath37 , for @xmath38 , with constant @xmath39 if for any @xmath40 there is a solution @xmath41 of @xmath7 satisfying ( [ introduction div ] ) .",

    "we compare @xmath39 with @xmath44 , where @xmath10 is a domain obtained by applying an affine function to a domain @xmath45 satisfying @xmath37 .",
    "this result is standard and the proof uses the piola transform . before stating the lemma ,",
    "let us define the @xmath46-norm of a matrix @xmath47 as @xmath48 where the @xmath46-norm of a vector is @xmath49 .",

    "it can be seen that    @xmath72    as we mentioned before an important application of the existence of a right inverse of the divergence operator is the well - posedness of the stokes equations , given by : @xmath73 for a bounded lipschitz domain @xmath18 ( or more generally a john domain @xcite ) , it is known that , if @xmath74 , the dual space of @xmath75 , and @xmath76 with vanishing mean value , there exists a unique variational solution @xmath77 in @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , this solution satisfies the a priori estimate : @xmath79 where the constant @xmath80 depends only on @xmath10 .    on the other hand",

    "however , it was proved in @xcite that the well - posedness of the incompressible stokes equations ( @xmath81 in ( [ stokes ] ) ) is valid in weighted sobolev spaces for an arbitrary bounded domain @xmath10 if there exists a standard solution of @xmath7 , where @xmath13 is in a weighted sobolev spaces .",

    "we present the example using our notation .",

    "note that the function @xmath97 has its support in @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "finally , we repeat the process with the first two functions . thus , if @xmath100 we have that @xmath101 obtaining the claimed decomposition .",
    "note that we have used the vanishing mean value of @xmath13 only to prove that @xmath102 integrates zero . if we do not assume any other thing but integrability",
    ", we have that @xmath103 if @xmath104 and @xmath105 .    in this work",
    "we extend the decomposition shown in ( [ bogovskii ] ) when @xmath10 is the union of a collection of subdomains @xmath26 , where @xmath12 is a partial ordered countable set instead of a totally ordered finite set .",
    "in fact , @xmath12 is a rooted tree and the partial order is inherited from the graph structure .",
    "let us recall some definitions .",
    "a * rooted tree * is a connected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one simple path , and a * root * is simply a distinguished vertex @xmath106 . for these graphs it is possible to define a * partial order * @xmath107 as @xmath108 if and only if the unique path connecting @xmath109 with the root @xmath110 passes through @xmath111 .",
