    "+ the study of motion planners in the above setting was initiated by farber @xcite .",
    "he observed that a continuous motion planner on @xmath1 exists if and only if @xmath1 is contractible .",
    "this resulted in the introduction of the following invariant , which gives a way of measuring complexity of the motion planning problem .",

    "we take the term `` motion planner '' to mean an @xmath8-motion planner for some @xmath16 .",
    "we refer the reader to for an elaboration of the notion of topological complexity .",
    "( in particular , we note that @xmath17 is typically defined differently .",
    "however , if @xmath1 is an euclidean neighbourhood retract , which is the only case we will be interested in , the definitions coincide . )",
    "a shortcoming of farber s approach to complexity of the motion planning problem is that it does not take into consideration any notion of efficiency , e.g. measured in terms of covered distance or spent energy .",
    "it is very natural that , given a motion planner , one would like to somehow quantify its efficiency and then , possibly even more urgently , understand how far - off of the most efficient planner it is .",
    "+ the aim of this note is to show that @xmath17 actually addresses the problem hinted at above . in order to do this ,",
    "we introduce the notion of _ efficient topological complexity _",
    ", denoted @xmath18 , which takes into account only motion planners with the lowest possible `` average length '' of paths , and then prove that it never differs from @xmath17 by too much , at least for nice spaces :    [ thm : main ] if @xmath1 is a smooth closed orientable riemannian manifold , then @xmath19",
    "fix once and for all a smooth compact orientable riemannian manifold @xmath1 and write @xmath20 for its riemannian metric . given a path @xmath21 , let @xmath22 denote its length , understood in the metric sense for paths which are merely continuous .",
    "we do not assume that @xmath23 is rectifiable , hence it is possible that @xmath24 .    1 .",
    "the _ length _ of a motion planner @xmath25 is @xmath26 note that each domain of continuity of @xmath27 is measurable and thus @xmath28 is well - defined .",
    "moreover , it is clear that @xmath29 .",
    "the _ efficient topological complexity _ of @xmath1 , denoted @xmath30 , is the minimal integer @xmath15 such that there exists an @xmath8-motion planner @xmath27 on @xmath1 with @xmath31 .",
    "such a motion planner @xmath27 will be called _",
    "it is not _ a priori _ clear whether efficient motion planners always exist .",
    "this will follow from our proof of theorem [ thm : main ] , which we briefly prepare for now .",
    "+ additionally assume that @xmath1 has no boundary .",
    "write @xmath32 for the maximal normal neighbourhood in @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the cut locus of a point @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a diffeomorphism ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 28.2 ) .",
    "let @xmath38        \\(1 ) since @xmath37 is a diffeomorphism for any @xmath35 , @xmath44 is a bijection and , furthermore , its derivative is invertible at any point @xmath45 .",
    "consequently @xmath44 is a a bijective local diffeomorphism , hence a diffeomorphism",
    ".      we can now give the proof of our main result .",
    "+ _ proof of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "_ clearly , @xmath47 .",
    "we will show that @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 and choose an @xmath50-motion planner @xmath51 on @xmath1 .",
    "set @xmath52 and define @xmath53 by assigning @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the projection onto the second coordinate .",
    "note that @xmath56 is the unique minimal geodesic from @xmath57 to  @xmath58 , so that @xmath59",
    ". it follows from lemma [ lemma : exp ] that @xmath60 is locally compact and @xmath61 is continuous .",
    "now set , for @xmath62 ,      then @xmath65 constitutes an @xmath8-motion planner on  @xmath1 .",
    "again by lemma [ lemma : exp ] , the complement of @xmath66 is a measure - zero subset , hence so are the sets @xmath67 , @xmath68 . therefore @xmath69 which concludes the proof.@xmath70 +    the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] shows that in order to estimate topological complexity of @xmath1 , it is enough to understand how to motion plan between points @xmath57 , @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "this observation can be formalized through the notion of _ relative topological complexity_. namely , if @xmath73 , then @xmath74 is expressed in terms of local sections of the fibration @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.24 ) , setting @xmath76 , we obtain @xmath77 this is , in fact , farber s ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 4.8 ) approach to motion planners on spheres : recall that if @xmath78 is embedded in @xmath79 in the usual manner , the cut locus of any point @xmath80 consists precisely of the antipode of  @xmath57 .",
    "the difficulty thus boils down to estimating @xmath81 .",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] shows that , perhaps a little surprisingly , @xmath30 depends on the choice of a riemannian metric on @xmath1 only in a very restricted manner .",
    "a natural question to consider is whether it depends on that choice at all ?",
    "the following simple example sheds some light on this problem in the case when  @xmath1 has a non - empty boundary .",
    "( which , admittedly , is not covered by theorem [ thm : main ] . )",
    "let @xmath82 be the two - dimensional unit disk in @xmath83 .",
    "straight line segments give rise to a continuous efficient motion planner on @xmath82 , hence @xmath84 .",
    "now consider @xmath82 embedded in @xmath85 as the upper hemisphere @xmath86 of the two - dimensional unit sphere .",
    "suppose that @xmath87 .",
    "then there exists a continuous motion planner @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "this and continuity of @xmath90 imply that @xmath91 .",
    "thus @xmath92 traverses the arc of a minimal geodesic from @xmath57  to @xmath58 for all @xmath57 , @xmath93 by .",
    "this , however , is absurd , because such a motion planner can not be continuous on the set @xmath94 of pairs of antipodal points from the boundary circle . on the other hand ,",
    "it is easy two to construct an efficient motion planner on  @xmath95 with two domains of continuity .",
    "indeed , @xmath27 is continuous on @xmath96 , and in order to navigate on @xmath94 it suffices to fix orientation of the boundary circle .",
    "we would also like to draw the reader s attention to the fact that the motion planner @xmath97 defined almost everywhere on @xmath10 in the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] has the following desirable properties :    * if the initial and terminal states coincide , the output path is constant ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . *",
    "the path from @xmath57 to @xmath58 is the same as that from @xmath58 to @xmath57 , only traversed in the opposite direction ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . *",
    "re - evaluating a motion in its middle does not change the choice of navigation arc , i.e. if @xmath98 is the re - evaluation instant , then @xmath99    the last property draws attention to the problem of algorithmically finding a vector in @xmath33 pointing in the direction of a minimizing geodesic from @xmath57 to  @xmath58 , rather than deciding on the whole motion at once .",
    "this approach highlights the concept of _ autonomy _ of a mechanical system , allowing it to plan its motion _ on - the - fly _ , perhaps making it possible to correct the path in case obstacles appear . +",
