    "the spin liquid ( sl ) is the state of a magnetic system characterized by short range spin - spin correlations down to temperatures much lower than the curie - weiss temperature , @xmath8 , which is set by the magnetic interactions . while the sl concept was originally proposed in 1973 in the context of a spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice ,  @xcite it is only in recent years that its systematic experimental search in highly frustrated magnetic systems has really taken off .",
    "@xcite a number of quasi two - dimensional  @xcite and three - dimensional ( @xmath9 @xcite materials with sl behavior have been tentatively identified . yet , the tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 insulator is perhaps one of the @xmath10 highly frustrated magnetic systems with sl behavior that has been attracting interest for the longest time .",
    "@xcite in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , the magnetic tb@xmath11 ions reside on a pyrochlore lattice of corner - sharing tetrahedra . despite @xmath12 k ,  @xcite tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2",
    "does not develop conventional magnetic long range order down to at least @xmath13 mk .",
    "@xcite    it is unclear why tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 fails to order .",
    "@xcite it was originally thought that the tb@xmath11 magnetic moments could be described by classical ising spins that can only point in or out of a given tetrahedron ,  @xcite similar to the ho@xmath11 and dy@xmath11 moments in the ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite and dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite spin ice materials .",
    "@xcite however , such an ising model for tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 predicts a transition to a four sublattice nel ordered state at a temperature around 1 k ,  @xcite in dramatic disagreement with experiments .",
    "@xcite the microscopic justification for depicting the tb@xmath11 moments as ising spins stems from considering only the single ion crystal field ( cf ) ground state doublet of tb@xmath11 and neglecting higher excited levels when describing the system at temperatures @xmath14 k.  @xcite however , a number of experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite results argue against such an ising description .",
    "for example , an ising model fails to explain , even at a qualitative level , the symmetry of the neutron scattering intensity pattern , @xmath15 , even in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "@xcite interestingly , @xmath15 remains largely unaltered from 4 k  @xcite down to 50 mk , never extending much beyond the size of a tetrahedron primitive basis .",
    "@xcite one must therefore incorporate the excited cf states when constructing an effective low - energy hamiltonian , @xmath16 , describing tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 at @xmath14 k. the main reason for this necessity is that , unlike in spin ices ,  @xcite the exchange and dipolar interactions in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 are not much smaller than the energy gap @xmath17 k separating the ground and first excited cf doublets .",
    "@xcite also , when described as a classical @xmath18 ising model , tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 is found to be close to the boundary between an `` all - in / all - out '' four sublattice nel ordered ground state and a spin ice state .",
    "@xcite hence , perturbations , such as those introduced by virtual excitations to the excited crystal field states ,  @xcite can in principle give rise to new ground states , and these excitations must therefore be considered at the very outset .",
    "a recent work @xcite argued , on the basis of perturbation theory calculations that consider an independent tetrahedra approximation ( ita ) to model the sl state of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , that exchange and magnetic dipole - dipole interactions induce significant admixing between the ground and excited cf states .",
    "most importantly , this admixing renormalizes the ising ( longitudinal ) part of @xmath16 from that of a non - frustrated @xmath19 ising antiferromagnet  @xcite to that of a frustrated @xmath19 ising ferromagnet , in essence turning the system into a spin ice .",
    "@xcite interaction - induced admixing of the cf states also generates effective off - diagonal ( transverse ) spin - spin interactions in @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite as a result , tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 may possibly be described by an effective frustrated @xmath20 ising ferromagnet model with additional quantum fluctuations transverse to the local @xmath21 directions .",
    "@xcite in other words , tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 may be viewed in the temperature range [ 50 mk @xmath22 10 k ] as being in a thermally and quantum mechanically fluctuating spin ice state where frustrated ferromagnetic correlations in the @xmath18 ising components exist at the shortest lengthscale @xmath4 a _ quantum spin ice _ ( qsi ) of sorts .",
    "@xcite hence , tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 may constitute an exciting playground to explore quantum effects in a spin ice system with the qsi proposal providing a long awaited and useful theoretical perspective to rationalize tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite the possibility of a qsi in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 is also of somewhat fundamental interest as it may relate to the topical problem of fractionalized spin excitations and emerging photon - like excitations in theoretical models of frustrated quantum ising antiferromagnets on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "@xcite    because of the accidental quasi - cancellation of the exchange and dipolar energy scales at the nearest - neighbor level , the zero - frequency qsi correlations in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 may be masked by strong dynamical fluctuations and difficult to detect via neutron scattering  @xcite and muon spin relaxation experiments .",
    "@xcite from this perspective , the behaviors exhibited by tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 may be viewed as an interesting example of the spectral weight downshift expected in highly frustrated magnetic systems .",
    "@xcite we believe that this phenomenology is an important part of the physics of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and at the origin of the stumbling blocks in developping a microscopic theoretical understanding of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite with this in mind , we explore here whether low temperature bulk magnetization , @xmath23 , measurements may be used to expose whether the nearest - neighbor part of the longitudinal ( ising ) sector of @xmath16 describing tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 is indeed that of a frustrated @xmath19 ferromagnet  @xcite and , therefore , whether a qsi description of this system is correct .",
    "perhaps one of the clearest tell - tale bulk magnetic signatures of frustrated ferromagnetic `` two - in / two - out '' ice - rule correlations  @xcite in a spin ice material is the emergence of a magnetization plateau for a magnetic field @xmath5 along the @xmath6 $ ] direction ( diagonal of the conventional cubic unit cell ) at low temperatures once the ice - rule obeying spin correlations have become established .",
    "@xcite motivated by this magnetization plateau phenomenon in classical ising spin ices , we therefore ask here whether a plateau - like feature in the @xmath6 $ ] magnetization can also develop in the collective paramagnetic regime of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 as the frustrated ferromagnetic @xmath18 spin correlations develop at the shortest ( single tetrahedron ) lengthscale .    the suggestion that tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 may be described at low energies and low temperatures by an effective hamiltonian , @xmath16 , whose",
    "longitudinal ising components are frustrated by effective nearest - neighbor couplings was motivated by perturbation theory calculations carried out over a single tetrahedron of interacting tb@xmath11 ions .",
    "@xcite the coupling between the @xmath19 ising components for a pair of interacting tb@xmath11 ions is in principle renormalized by the interactions with all the other tb@xmath11 ions in the system .",
    "therefore , an important question is whether the frustrated `` two - in / two - out '' spin - ice - like correlations are preserved in a perturbation theory extended to a thermodynamically large lattice and , in particular , in the presence of the long - range magnetostatic dipole - dipole interactions between tb@xmath11 ions .",
    "@xcite our preliminary perturbation theory calculations carried over the whole lattice show that the system remains in an ice - rule obeying ground state with competing states with a `` three - in / one - out '' spin configuration having a slightly higher energy .",
    "@xcite consequently , we would expect that , in an `` exact '' treatment of @xmath16 at nonzero temperature , spin ice `` two - in / two - out '' correlations would develop at low temperatures .",
    "the important question is therefore whether such correlations actually develop in real tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 at low temperatures and if they can be evinced by the observation of a @xmath6 $ ] magnetization plateau .    to get a preliminary handle on the relevant temperature and magnetic field scale where qsi physics may become experimentally discernable in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2",
    ", we consider the same ita used in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the sl state of that material since , as stated above , interactions beyond a single tetrahedron do not spoil the existence of an ice - rule obeying semi - classical ground state .",
    "@xcite the merit of the ita to describe the collective paramagnetic state of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the context of the work presented here",
    ", one could interpret the ita as a self - consistent cluster mean - field theory ( scmft )  @xcite where the considered cluster is a tetrahedron , _ but _ where the self - consistency conditions that incorporate the inter - clusters ( inter - tetrahedra ) interactions have been set to zero .",
    "this is because we are describing the collective paramagnetic / spin liquid regime of the model where the correlations extend solely over the smallest cluster lengthscale where no global symmetry is ( yet ) spontaneously broken .",
    "the experimental observation that spin correlations in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 never develop beyond the size of a single tetrahedron from a temperature of @xmath24 k down to 50 mk  @xcite would seem to further provide a post - factum justification to this `` constrained '' paramagnetic description of a scmft of the @xmath16 of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite in other words , the ita should be qualitatively valid for sufficiently small field and temperatures such that long - range spin - spin correlations are not induced .",
    "@xcite finally , for the proposed experiment seeking to expose a magnetization plateau for @xmath5 along [ 111 ] , symmetry considerations play a crucial role ,  @xcite and the ita does capture that symmetry aspect of the problem .",
    "below , we find that for parameter values for which the model exhibits a qsi , and which are appropriate for tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ,  @xcite the low - temperature magnetization @xmath25 ( @xmath26 mk ) does indeed exhibit a plateau for @xmath27 t.",

    "@xcite the plateau develops only at low temperature because the qsi state in @xmath64 in eq .",

    "the system is barely beyond the threshold for exhibiting a qsi state and one finds that the plateau is poorly formed even at @xmath101 mk . our calculations also show that , although a rescaling of @xmath93 and @xmath102 changes the magnetization plateau value and the @xmath90 range over which a magnetization plateau arises , it does not change the generic qualitative behavior seen in fig . 1 as long as the model , and presumably the real system , displays a qsi state for @xmath7 or , in other words , as long as the system possesses frustrated ferromagnetic interactions in the nearest - neighbor ising part of @xmath16 .",

    "the three states with ion # 1 in ( i.e. polarized along [ 111 ] ) have a lower zeeman energy than the other three two - in / two - out states .",
    "hence , with @xmath123 , a state with larger weight from these components , i.e. with ion # 1 , has lower energy than the @xmath7 @xmath124 state and become the ground state . as a result ,",
    "for non - zero and sufficiently weak @xmath90 , the ground state evolves from @xmath125 to a state @xmath104 with @xmath126 and with @xmath117 ( @xmath117 because @xmath119 does not admix @xmath127 with at any order in @xmath119 ) .    as @xmath95",
