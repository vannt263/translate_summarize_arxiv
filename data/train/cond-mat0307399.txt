    "impurities make a useful tool in probing the ground state of high - temperature superconductors .",
    "the most direct impurity probe of the superconducting state is provided by the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurement of the local quasiparticle density of states ( ldos ) around a single impurity .",
    "the stm images of @xmath0 reveal a tetragonal symmetry representative for the d - wave state @xcite .",
    "in addition to a possible identification of the superconducting state , this experiment may shed light on the nature of the quasiparticle scattering process - issue , which is important to the interpretation of the impurity pair - breaking effect in the d - wave superconductor .",
    "it has been shown that the weak impurity - induced suppression of the critical temperature , which is unexpected for d - wave superconductivity @xcite can be understood assuming a momentum - dependent ( anisotropic ) impurity potential @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we discuss the effect of anisotropic impurity scattering on the critical temperature , local density of states in the vicinity of a single impurity , and the quasiparticle density of states for a finite impurity concentration in a d - wave superconductor .",
    "we establish how the internal structure of a defect , which reproduces @xmath1 suppression in the cuprates , alters the above quantities .",
    "we assume that the impurity potential factorizes    @xmath2    where @xmath3 , @xmath4 are isotropic and anisotropic scattering amplitudes , respectively , and @xmath5 is the anisotropy function that vanishes after integration over the fermi surface .",
    "we study the effect of anisotropy by referring to an isotropic impurity potential @xmath6 that determines the scattering strength in both isotropic and anisotropic scattering channels : @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ; where @xmath9 is a partition parameter .",
    "scattering is isotropic for @xmath10 and purely anisotropic for @xmath11 . for the analysis of different scattering limits we introduce a convenient parameter @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the density of states per spin at the fermi level in the normal state .",
    "born scattering is then given by @xmath14 , and the unitary scattering limit is determined by @xmath15 . in the calculations we assume a parabolic energy band and two - dimensional superconductivity .",
    "we discuss the impurity effect on the d - wave superconducting state determined by the order parameter @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , and the amplitude of @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 .",
    "the role of the anisotropy of the impurity potential is particularly clear for the potential ( [ e1 ] ) with an oscillating anisotropy function , which is given on the fermi surface as @xmath20 .",
    "the critical temperature in the born limit reads @xcite    @xmath21 + \\left < ef\\right>^{2}\\left[\\psi\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right.\\\\ \\\\ { \\displaystyle}\\left . -\\psi\\left",
    "( \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{\\pi n_0\\left(v_i^2+v_a^2\\right)}{2\\pi t_{c } } \\left(1-\\frac{2v_iv_a}{v_i^2+v_a^2}\\right)\\right)\\right]\\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ]    and for unitary scattering is given by    @xmath22\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the critical temperature of a pure system , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the impurity concentration .",
    "based on the impurity effect on @xmath1 we can distinguish two groups of scattering potentials determined by the value of the coupling term @xmath26 : the in phase potential with @xmath27 , and the out of phase potential defined by @xmath28 .",
    "analysis of eqs .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) shows that the impurity pair - breaking is minimized for the in phase scattering , that is for @xmath27 or close to @xmath29 , which is achieved for @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "it has been shown that when the scattering is close to being in phase it reproduces the observed @xmath1 suppression @xcite and the @xmath32 critical field initial slope @xcite in the cuprates .",
    "on the other hand , when the scattering is out of phase with the order parameter @xmath33 , or @xmath34 it gives @xmath28 and strong suppression of the critical temperature .",
    "the differing effect of these two groups of impurity potential is also seen in the solution to the gap equation . in fig .",
    "1 we show the gap at a temperature of @xmath35 as a function of the anisotropy degree @xmath36 for in phase ( solid line ) and out of phase scattering ( dashed line ) in the unitary limit .",
    "we note that the anisotropy leading to the maximal @xmath1 for the in phase impurity potential , that is @xmath37 , gives the minimal @xmath1 for out of phase scattering .",
    "the position - dependent change of the quasiparticle density of states around a single impurity is determined by the real space transform of the retarded green s function @xmath38 and reads @xmath39 .",
    "the green s function is obtained from dyson s equation @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the quasiparticle propagator for a pure system and the impurity - induced self - energy @xmath42 is obtained within a single impurity approximation , i.e. , the t - matrix equation is solved with the green s function of a pure system .",
    "we have evaluated the ldos at the impurity site for different partitions of the impurity potential starting from isotropic scattering ( @xmath10 ) and ending on purely anisotropic scattering ( @xmath11 ) . for in phase scattering ( fig .",
    "2 ) we observe a shift of the spectral density from the hole - like resonant state for isotropic scattering to the electron - like resonant state for scattering close to being purely anisotropic .",
    "this effect is similar to the changes in the ldos induced by deviations from particle - hole symmetry , or by changes in sign of the scattering potential @xcite .",
    "the influence of the out of phase anisotropy of the scattering potential is entirely different .",
    "it turns out that the increasing degree of anisotropy broadens and finally destroys the impurity resonant state ( fig .",
    "+     +     +",
    "the quasiparticle density of states for a uniform impurity distribution is obtained self - consistently within the t - matrix approximation , i.e. , the matrix @xmath43 is obtained with the use of a dressed single - particle propagator @xmath44 , and the self - energy is determined by @xmath45 , where @xmath25 is the impurity concentration @xcite .",
    "we have evaluated the density of states , given by the imaginary part of the retarded green s function @xmath46 , in the limit of born scattering ( @xmath47 ) , intermediate scattering ( @xmath48 ) and unitary scattering ( @xmath49 ) . for each considered scattering strength",
    "we have compared the effect of the isotropic impurity potential , the anisotropic potential in phase with the order parameter and the out of phase anisotropic potential ( fig .",
    "the degree of anisotropy was set to @xmath50 .",
    "although the discussed potentials lead to similar densities of states in the born limit , observable differences between anisotropic in phase and out of phase potentials are seen for intermediate scattering and they become significant for the resonant scattering when the in phase potential gives @xmath51 , and the out of phase potential enhances the non - zero value of @xmath52 .",
    "we have shown that the anisotropy of the impurity potential can broaden or destroy the impurity resonant state .",
    "the energy level of the impurity resonant state relative to fermi energy can be shifted by the anisotropy of the impurity potential , in particular the hole - like resonant state is transformed into the electron - like resonant state for highly anisotropic in phase scattering .",
    "significant is also effect of anisotropy on the quasiparticle density of states which is best seen for unitary impurities .",
    "the nonzero value of the low - energy density of states for isotropic scattering is enhanced by the anisotropic impurity potential which is out of phase with the order parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "the in phase impurity potential leads to a vanishing density of states at the fermi level .",
    "these results show that the quasiparticle properties of a disordered d - wave superconductor depend , apart from the way of modeling the disorder @xcite , on the internal structure of a scattering center .",
