    "some deterministic global optimization algorithms have been proposed in recent years , and they are able to solve much general optimization problems such as nonconvex continuous , mixed - integer , differential - algebraic , bilevel , and non - factorable problems @xcite .",
    "the development of deterministic and stochastic just indicate what the  no free lunch theorems \" means , that is , there exists no algorithm which is better than its competitor over all problems @xcite . + in the meanwhile , a novel global optimization theory called the _",

    "the kernels of the theory consist of a canonical dual transformation methodology , a complementary - dual principle , and a triality theory @xcite .",
    "the main merit is that this theory can transform nonconvex / nonsmoonth / discrete optimization / variational problems into continuous concave maximization problems over convex domains , which can be solved easily , under certain conditions , by many well - developed algorithms and softwares .",
    "therefore , the canonical duality theory has been used successfully for solving a large class of challenging problems in computational biology @xcite , engineering mechanics @xcite , information theory @xcite , network communications @xcite , nonlinear dynamical systems @xcite , and some np - hard problems in global optimization @xcite .",
    "+ however , it was realized that the canonical dual problem may have no critical point in the dual feasible space and in this case , the primal problem could be np - hard @xcite . by introducing a linear perturbation term to the primal problem or a quadratic perturbation term to the dual problem",
    ", the issue can be partially tackled with to some extent but is still an open problem @xcite . for one thing , it is not easy to find such an appropriate perturbation . for another , only approximate solution is obtained due to the perturbation . on the other hand ,",
    "it is undoubtedly that solving a constrained optimization problem ( a continuous concave maximization problem over convex domain ) is much more difficult than an unconstrained one .",
    "therefore , some approaches , such as the penalty function method , aim to convert a constrained minimization problem into an equivalent unconstrained one to reduce the computational complexity . +",
    "as is known to us , for nonconvex optimization problem , methods based on gradient are dependent on initial point , and choosing a good initial point can reach a good solution in the end . to overcome local optimality",
    ", it usually requires some type of diversification to find the global optimum .",
    "for instance , the multi - start methods , which are applied by starting from multiple random initial solutions , are widely used to realize diversification @xcite .",
    "however , it remains hard to construct good initial solutions .",
    "+ fortunately , the global optimality condition contained in triality theory , can identify the global minimum , which provides with greatly useful information to select a good initial point and can be utilized to develop related canonical dual algorithms . in this study , we show that , under certain conditions , the canonical dual problem is essentially equivalent to the standard semi - definite programming ( sdp ) problem and then be solved by well - developed software packages , such as sedumi @xcite . in the case that the canonical dual problem has no critical point , four strategies are proposed to develop efficient algorithms based on unconstrained approaches by using the core points of canonical dual transformation methodology , complementary - dual principle and global optimality condition . a series of fourth - order polynomials benchmark optimization problems are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed strategies .",
    "for the completeness of this paper , we give a brief review of the following fourth - order polynomials minimization problem ( primal problem ) in @xcite : @xmath0 where , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are indefinite symmetrical matrices , @xmath3 are given vectors , @xmath4 are known constants . without loss of much generality , the @xmath5 is assumed to be positive .",

    "<S> the canonical duality theory has provided with a unified analytic solution to a range of discrete and continuous problems in global optimization , which can transform a nonconvex primal problem to a concave maximization dual problem over a convex domain without duality gap . </S>",
    "<S> this paper shows that under certain conditions , this canonical dual problem is equivalent to the standard semi - definite programming ( sdp ) problem , which can be solved by well - developed software packages . in order to avoid certain difficulties of using the sdp method , </S>",
    "<S> four strategies are proposed based on unconstrained approaches , which can be used to develop algorithms for solving some challenging problems . </S>",
    "<S> applications are illustrated by fourth - order polynomials benchmark optimization problems .    </S>",
