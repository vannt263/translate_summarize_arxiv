    "in the early work of wu _ et . al _ @xcite a general numerical algorithm was developed which could reconstruct a one - dimensional ( 1d ) local potential from an essentially arbitrary set of levels ( i.e. , bound - states ) .",
    "the basic idea behind the method ( see sec .",
    "ii below ) is to functionally minimize the potential so that it reproduces the prescribed energy eigenvalues to numerical accuracy .",
    "this is , in principle , a solution of the 1d quantum inverse problem for a confined system if one could fit the infinitely many levels to a local potential . of course",
    ", this is beyond any numerical algorithm s ability , and one has to settle for fitting only the first @xmath3 eigenvalues . since the algorithm requires a direct solution of the schrdinger equation ( se ) for every eigenvalue , it is practically limited to fitting roughly @xmath4 eigenvalues . in an interesting application of this algorithm , wu and sprung @xcite chose as their eigenvalue spectrum the complex zeros ( it is implicit throughout this paper that zeros refer to the complex zeros of the zeta function ) of the riemann zeta function , which is well known in number theory @xcite . by finding a local 1d potential which exactly reproduced the first @xmath5 `` eigenvalues '' ,",
    "they had effectively found a 1d quantum hamiltonian for the first 500 zeros of the riemann zeta function .",
    "this is of course interesting in its own right because such hamiltonians have long been conjectured to hold the key to proving the celebrated riemann hypothesis @xcite .",
    "their reconstructed potential was found to be fractal , and the fractal dimension was estimated to be @xmath6 .",
    "this result suggests the intriguing possibility that an integrable system with time - reversal symmetry may generate the riemann zeros provided the potential is fractal .",
    "it is worth commenting that the precise meaning one can attach to such 1d potentials is not clear . in particular , taking a chaotic system ( i.e. , the riemann zeros ) and forcing it to be integrable will lead to a potential that is dependent on the dimension of the hilbert space ( i.e.",
    ", number of levels fitted ) .    motivated by the work mentioned above , ramani _ et",
    ".  al_@xcite also investigated the reconstruction of a 1d system s quantum hamiltonian from its eigenvalues .",
    "their approach to solving the inverse problem was to use a `` dressing transformation '' based on techniques developed in the solution of the nonlinear korteweg - de vries equation .",
    "their method , being much more efficient numerically than the direct se approach resulted in many more levels being fitted for the same numerical effort .",
    "unfortunately , rather than directly examining the riemann zeros , as wu and sprung had previously done , they investigated the fractal properties of potentials generated from energy levels whose nearest - neighbour spacing distribution ( nnsd ) were the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) @xcite . although the nnsd of the riemann zeros are also known to belong to the gue , ramani _ et .",
    "al _ could only make general comments about 1d potentials generated from the gue statistics , but nothing specific about the riemann zeros . nevertheless , their work suggests , using @xmath7 levels , a fractal dimension of @xmath8 as @xmath9 for gue reconstructed potentials . by extension , they conjectured that their more accurate estimate of the fractal dimension leads to a value of @xmath8 for the riemann potential .",
    "in a reply to this work , wu and sprung @xcite have pointed out that using a different spectrum ( i.e. , a set of energy levels whose nnsd is the gue rather than the actual complex riemann zeros ) does not necessarily imply that the fractal dimension of the reconstructed potential should be the same .",
    "one of the key reasons behind this statement is the lack of long - range correlations ( i.e. , the so - called spectral rigidity @xmath2 ) in the generic gue spectrum used in ref .",
    "indeed , it was argued that if the fitting spectrum does not contain proper long - range correlations , the resulting potential may appear to be more random than the riemann zeros potential .",
    "this , of course , can result in two different estimates for the fractal dimension even if a large number of levels have been fitted .",
    "another important concern raised in their reply is that the potential obtained by inversion of the levels need not be unique . in other words ,",
    "even if ramani _ et . al _ had used the riemann zeros as their fitting spectrum , they may not have obtained the same potential ; that is , the fractal dimension may depend on the inversion technique applied .    in light of the above",
    ", we believe that there are several questions which have been left unanswered : ( i ) for the same set of energy levels , are the potentials reconstructed from different inversion procedures unique ?",
    "( ii ) does the fractal dimension depend on the inversion technique ?",
    "what is the fractal dimension for the riemann zeros potential ? ( iv ) is the fractal dimension a generic quantity for reconstructed 1d potentials or does it depend on the nnsd and @xmath2 statistics of the energy level spectrum ?    in what follows , we will attempt to provide answers to these questions",
    ". we will begin by presenting a brief overview of the numerical inversion techniques used in refs .",
    "@xcite , and then apply them to reconstruct the potentials of the riemann zeros and prime numbers .",
    "our decision to focus on these number sequences is three - fold .",
    "first , the contradictory results @xmath0 and @xmath8 for the fractal dimension of the riemann potential remains unresolved .",
    "secondly , the riemann zeros are known to be dual to the prime numbers in the sense that all of the primes are encoded through the complex riemann zeros via riemann s formula @xcite .",
    "one may then speculate as to whether any additional relationships between the riemann zeros and prime numbers can be obtained from the reconstructed fractal potentials .",
    "finally , since the nnsd of the riemann zeros belong to the gue class , and the prime numbers obey a more poisson - like distribution , it is interesting to investigate the dependence of the fractal dimension on the level statistics .",
    "the reconstructed potentials obtained from the two inversion methods will then be used to address the questions of uniqueness and fractal dimension .",
    "in this section , we will give a brief overview of the two inversion techniques used in this paper to reconstruct the local 1d potentials .",
    "after this presentation , we will compare the reconstructed potentials for the riemann zeros and prime number sequence obtained from both methods .",
    "perhaps the most intuitive approach to solving the inverse problem is to directly invoke the se .",
    "one initially starts from some arbitrary potential @xmath10 ( although for reasons of convergence , it is wiser to start from the semiclassical potential as described in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and solve the se to obtain a set of eigenvalues @xmath11 .",
    "one then defines a `` cost function '' f = _ n(_n - e_n)^2  , where the @xmath12 are the exact eigenvalues one wishes to reproduce .",
    "the potential @xmath10 is now adjusted in such a way as to minimize the cost function .",
    "mathematically , this results in the following functional equation : = 2_n ( _ n - e_n)^2_n(x ) = 0  , where @xmath13 is the @xmath14-th normalized wavefunction .",
    "the functional minimization can be performed using a conjugate gradient method and the numerov technique can be used to solve the discrete 1d se .",
    "we have used this approach to successfully reproduce all of the numerical data for the riemann zeros reported in ref .",
    "unfortunately , even on modern pc / workstations , this direct approach involves a large computational undertaking .",
    "we have found it impractical to go beyond @xmath15 levels when using this technique .",
    "the basis for the dressing transformation can be found in the soliton theory of nonlinear wave equations .",
    "the details of this approach are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we give here only the essential equations required for its implementation .",
    "the starting point is a given set of levels @xmath16 which have been shifted so that one has exactly @xmath17 negative eigenvalues with the last eigenvalue satisfying @xmath18 . in this way",
    ", the potential is constructed from the `` top down '' .",
    "this does not impose any restrictions other than the requirement that the number of levels to be fitted is fixed in advance .",
    "an initial potential @xmath19 is then used as input and the first - order differential equation ( diffeq ) f - f^2 + v(x ) = [ feq ] is evaluated numerically with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "once the function @xmath22 has been found at all points , a new potential @xmath23 is constructed from the diffeq : w(x ) = 2 + 2f^2 - v(x )  .",
    "this new potential is then substituted back into eq .",
    "( [ feq ] ) ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) with the eigenvalue now being @xmath25 .",
    "the choice @xmath26 is enforced throughout the calculation and ensures that the final potential @xmath10 is even .",
    "this iterative procedure is continued until all of the eigenvalues have been exhausted .",
    "the final @xmath23 is the desired reconstructed potential which reproduces exactly all of the @xmath3 eigenvalues .",
    "the integration of eq .",
    "( [ feq ] ) can be performed using any standard method , but we have used a fourth - order runge - kutta ( rk ) method with step size @xmath27 to ensure high accuracy .",
    "nevertheless , it should be clear that the dressing transformation is numerically a far superior method since it does not require a large parameter search in the construction of the potential .",
    "consequently , it is easy to fit orders of magnitude more levels than in the direct se approach .",
    "having provided the basic background for numerically solving the inverse problem , we are now in a position to address the question of uniqueness . to this end",
    ", we first reconstruct the potential for the riemann zeros with @xmath28 .",
    "this number was chosen because it represents the maximum number of riemann zeros fitted in ref .",
    "figure 1 displays the potential obtained from the direct se approach ( solid curve ) and the dressing transformation ( dashed ) . in the inset to the figure , we zoom - in on the the region @xmath29 $ ] to illustrate the remarkable agreement between the two methods , which continues until one approaches energies near the last fitted level @xmath30 . obviously above this threshold",
    "the potentials will not agree since the se approach uses the semiclassical profile as its zeroth - order potential whereas the dressing transformation takes @xmath31 .",
    "however , as the number of levels is increased , this threshold is moved to higher and higher energies , so that as @xmath9 , the two potentials should agree over all space .",
    "the equivalence between the two inversion techniques has been checked for up to @xmath15 ( which computationally speaking , represents the upper limit of the se approach ) , but we see absolutely no reason why this equivalence should not be true for arbitrarily large @xmath3 . nevertheless , to ensure that this agreement is not in some way fortuitous , we have also reconstructed the potential for the prime number sequence with @xmath28 .",
    "the results of the two approaches for the primes are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "again , the potentials are indistinguishable except for regions near the last fitted level .",
    "it also proves instructive to compare in more detail the reconstructed potentials for the riemann zeros and prime numbers . to facilitate this comparison",
    ", we present in fig .",
    "3 details of the potentials for @xmath32 levels around the minimum ( one could look at any other region on the curves and obtain similar graphs ) .",
    "figure 3 ( a)-(c ) corresponds to the riemann zeros whereas fig .",
    "3 ( d)-(f ) corresponds to the prime potential .",
    "several interesting observations can be made at this point .",
    "first , we note that for a given number of fitted levels , the riemann zeros potential looks less `` noisy '' than the prime potential .",
    "in fact , by @xmath33 , the prime potential takes on the characteristics of ( roughly speaking ) white noise whereas the riemann zero potential appears to have far more structure .",
    "in particular , the riemann potential contains large jumps at very specific spatial positions which appear to be quite robust ( i.e. , the positions of the jumps do not change as @xmath3 increases ) .",
    "in contrast , any local structure present in the prime potential is completely washed out by @xmath33 .",
    "this suggests that the prime potential may have a larger fractal dimension ( i.e. , close to @xmath8 of white - noise ) than the riemann zeros .",
    "indeed , these observations lead us to consider more closely the fractal potentials generated by ramani _ et . al _ @xcite .    as we mentioned earlier , the potentials in ref .",
    "@xcite were obtained from a generic gue distribution without accounting for the @xmath2 statistics . a comparison of our fig .  3 ( a)-(c ) with their fig .",
    "1 ( a)-(c ) clearly illustrates that a generic gue distribution _ can not _ capture , even qualitatively , the details of the riemann zeros potential .",
    "we are therefore inclined to agree with the assertion in ref .",
    "@xcite that long - range correlations in the level spectrum play an important role in determining the fractal properties of the potential .",
    "this is further emphasized by noting that for large @xmath3 , the prime potential [ see fig .",
    "3 ( f ) ] looks very similar to the large @xmath3 gue fractal potential in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was conjectured to have @xmath34 as @xmath9 .",
    "it is perhaps then not so ambitious to suggest that the prime potential also has fractal dimension @xmath8 .",
    "we can not however make such claims for the riemann zeros , which evidently require a more careful quantitative analysis .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that for the same number of fitted levels , the oscillatory behaviour of the riemann zeros and prime potentials are quite different . what significance then ( if any ) do these rapid oscillations have on the fractal dimension ? before we answer that question , it is perhaps useful to give a short account of the method used by the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite to estimate the fractal dimension of their reconstructed potentials .    the standard procedure for numerically estimating the fractal dimension of curves such as the ones we have generated is to use the box - counting technique @xcite .",
    "simply put , the box - counting technique involves choosing a region on the curve ( over which the character of the oscillations does not change ) and normalizing the axes so that the region is a square of side length equal to unity .",
    "the square region is then divided into @xmath35 cells of side length @xmath36 and the number of cells @xmath37 that contain a portion of the curve is counted . a plot of @xmath38 versus .",
    "@xmath39 is then constructed and the region over which the resulting graph has a constant slope @xmath40 determines the box - dimension @xmath41 ; the box - dimension is usually simply referred to as _ the _ fractal dimension .",
    "although it is not the only method for estimating the fractal dimension of a curve , we will make use of the box - counting technique to allow for a sensible comparison with the results in refs .",
    "@xcite    in fig .  4",
    ", we display the results of the box - counting method as applied to the riemann potential for @xmath42 . in keeping with ref .",
    "@xcite , we have focused on the range @xmath43 $ ] for the analysis . what is clear from the figure is that the slope , @xmath44 , of the linear region in the graph is essentially unchanged for @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , the slopes for @xmath46 and @xmath33 are virtually identical . given that the fractal dimension is given by @xmath47 , we conclude that to two significant figures , @xmath0 for the the riemann zeros potential .",
    "this result is consistent with the findings of wu and sprung @xcite who likewise obtained @xmath0 .",
    "we see no evidence at all for @xmath8 as was suggested by the work of ramani _ et .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows the results of the box - counting method for the prime number potential .",
    "in contrast to the riemann zeros , there is a noticeable increase in the slope of the curve ( i.e. , larger fractal dimension ) as one increases the number of fitted levels from @xmath28 to @xmath46 .",
    "however , for @xmath48 ( not shown ) , the slope is found to be practically unchanged . we are therefore led to conclude that the fractal dimension of the primes is @xmath49 .",
    "we are , however , open to the possibility that as @xmath9 the fractal dimension of the prime potential approaches @xmath8 based on the qualitative behaviour of the potential seen in fig .",
    "3 ( d)-(f ) . indeed",
    ", a similar slow convergence of the fractal dimension was also observed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the gue statistics .",
    "however , numerically investigating this convergence would require possibly millions of levels , which is well beyond the capabilities of our current computational facilities .",
    "we have numerically examined the reconstruction of a 1d local potential from a set of energy levels using two distinct inversion procedures . applying these methods to the riemann zeros and the prime number sequence we find that both inversion techniques produce the same quantum potential when applied to the same set of energy levels .",
    "this provides evidence that the inversion problem in 1d results in a unique potential .",
    "thus , the answer to the first question raised in the introduction is affirmative .",
    "based on this finding , it follows that the fractal dimension can not depend on the method of inversion .",
    "we have also examined the issue of the fractal dimension of the riemann zeros for up to @xmath50 levels and estimate that @xmath0 .",
    "this result is in complete agreement with wu and sprung s @xcite earlier estimate ( albeit using only @xmath28 levels ) , and illustrates that the potentials investigated by ramani _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite have little bearing on the riemann zeros potential . in particular , we demonstrated that it is insufficient to simply account for the nnsd of the energy levels to capture the local details responsible for the fractal properties of the reconstructed potential ; the riemann zeros display local structure that is not reproduced by a generic gue level spectrum .",
    "therefore , long - range correlations appear to play a pivotal role in determining the fractal dimension of the potential",
    ".    the prime number potential has also been investigated , and found to have fractal dimension @xmath49 .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising since the nnsd of the primes is almost poisson - like , whereas the riemann zeros obey the ( chaotic ) gue statistics . unlike the riemann potential",
    ", our calculation of the prime potential s fractal dimension suggests that there may be a very slow convergence ( as @xmath9 ) of the fractal dimension to @xmath8 .",
    "this possibility has also been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite where the fractal properties of white noise - like potentials corresponding to the gue statistics were studied .",
