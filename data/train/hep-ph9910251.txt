    "the proton dipole cross section @xmath3  is a universal quantity in singly dissociative diffractive @xmath4 p processes .  @xcite it is simply the total cross section for scattering a qq pair of a given size and energy in the photonic fluctuation off the proton target .",
    "we make use of a parameterisation used to extract @xmath3  from a fit to electroproduction and photoproduction @xmath4 p total cross - section data  @xcite to predict the diffractive structure function @xmath0 .     [",
    "fig : fluct ]",
    "the dipole cross - section is in general a function of three variables ( figure  [ fig : fluct ] ) : @xmath5 , the cms energy squared of the photon proton system ; @xmath6 , the transverse separation averaged over all orientations of the qq pair ; and @xmath7 , the fraction of the incoming photon light cone energy possessed by one member of the qq pair .",
    "we assumed a form with two terms , each with a regge type @xmath8 dependence and no dependence on @xmath7 .",
    "specifically , we assumed @xmath9 the dipole cross section is related to the photon proton cross section via @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the longitudinal and transverse components of the light cone photon wave function . for the photon wave function itself , we used the tree level qed expression  @xcite modified by a factor @xmath12 to represent confinement effects : @xmath13 \\epsilon^{2 } k_{1}^{2}(\\epsilon r ) + m_{f}^{2 }   k_{0}^{2}(\\epsilon r ) \\right\\ } \\times f(r)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath14 here @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 are modified bessel functions and the sum is over 3 light quark flavours , with a generic mass of assumed value @xmath18 gev@xmath19 .",
    "the values of the constants @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 were generated by the fit .",

    "typical feynman diagrams are shown in figure  [ fig : feynman ] .",
    "for compatibility with this approach , we must replace @xmath8 by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 . first defining @xmath26 we have for the longitudinal and transverse qq components respectively @xmath27 @xmath28 \\phi_{1 } + m^{2 } \\phi_{0 }   \\right\\}\\ ] ] where the lower limit of the integral over @xmath7 is given by @xmath29 and @xmath30",

    "( we have inserted a missing factor of 1/2 compared with the expression in  @xcite . )",
    "this expression diverges if our parameterisation is used as it stands .",
    "however , this is due solely to the mild divergence after @xmath3  saturates in @xmath6 of the factor @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "this behaviour at large @xmath6 is not determined by data and is an artefact of the parameterisation .",
    "hence we have imposed a saturation value for @xmath3  of its value at @xmath6 = 2  fm for all higher @xmath6 .",

    "comparison with zeus 1994",
    "data  @xcite also gives good agreement overall but with deviations at larger @xmath37  values for small and moderate @xmath36 .",
    "we have successfully predicted the diffractive structure function @xmath1using a parameterised dipole cross section obtained from electro- and photoproduction data . unlike the model proposed in  @xcite , the parameterisation exhibits effective saturation in @xmath6 only , with no saturation in the energy variable @xmath38 .",
    "agreement with data is reasonable , leading to the conclusion that the hera data do not necessarily indicate such saturation at present energies .",
