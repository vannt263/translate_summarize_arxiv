    "the earliest stages of stellar evolution for low - mass stars ( 0.22m@xmath1 ) are becoming reasonably clear ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) . the prestellar core stage @xcite represents the phase in which a gravitationally bound molecular cloud core has formed .",
    "thereafter gravitational collapse sets in ( possibly mediated by turbulence or magnetic fields ) and a central hydrostatic protostar forms , which together with its accreting disk and envelope , is known as a class 0 protostar @xcite .",
    "once half of the mass has accreted onto the central object it is known as a class i protostar @xcite , and it subsequently evolves through the class ii & iii young stellar object ( yso ) phases @xcite . to date",
    "only about 40 class 0 protostars are known , and a similar number of prestellar cores @xcite .",
    "debate continues over the details of the evolutionary process , and submillimetre studies of more star - forming regions are required to help clarify the exact manner in which star formation proceeds .",
    "the r coronae australis dark cloud is found at a distance of 170 pc and is one of the closest star - forming regions to the sun .",
    "the cloud is centred on the herbig ae / be stars rcra and tcra , which are the illumination sources of a bright reflection nebula ( ngc 6729 ) , and from which the region takes its name .",
    "there are also a number of other bright young stars in the region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the cloud was previously believed to have an unusually low star - forming efficiency @xcite . the discovery of a cluster of young stars termed the coronet @xcite close to rcra , changed this view .",
    "the cloud is now known to be actively forming stars , and contains a number of embedded objects revealed through radio @xcite and millimetre wavelength observations .",
    "there are a small number of nearby star - forming regions that we can study with good spatial resolution . if we are to understand the process of star formation , it is important that we characterise the similarities and differences between these regions .",
    "the rcra cloud is particularly interesting , as it is not a member of the gould belt .",
    "its formation is therefore potentially dominated by different physics than in the majority of other nearby clouds , which have formed as part of the gould belt .    in this paper",
    ", we report on submillimetre observations of the rcra molecular cloud .",
    "the observations are compared to those taken at other wavelengths , in an endeavour to understand the protostellar and prestellar population of the cloud .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table  [ masses ] we summarise the results and give mass estimates of the prestellar cores and protostellar envelopes for all of our detected sources .",
    "the envelope mass @xmath2 is calculated using the following : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the 850  @xmath0 m flux density , @xmath5 is the distance to the source , @xmath6 is the mass opacity of the gas and dust , and @xmath7 is the planck function at temperature @xmath8 .",
    "we follow who use a 1.3  mm mass opacity of @xmath9 which assumes a gas to dust ratio of 100 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we scale this value to 850  @xmath0 m using the canonical value of @xmath10 of 1.5 , which yields a value of @xmath6 of @xmath11 .",
    "we do this to be consistent with previous work .",
    "however , we note that for smm  1 , we have measured a @xmath10 of @xmath12",
    ". this would decrease the measured masses for the components of smm  1 quoted in table [ masses ] by @xmath13 .",
    "we note that we have been unable to accurately determine @xmath10 for the other sources .    the 1.2 mm continuum map of shows a similar morphology to our scuba data , featuring a strong peak  named mms  13 by  between rcra and tcra .",
    "the position of mms  13 is marked on figure  [ composite ] .",
    "the position and morphology of mms  13 is very similar to that of smm  1 in both the 450 and 850 @xmath0 m scuba data , when they are smoothed to 24 arcsec resolution .",
    "conclude that mms  13 may be a deeply embedded class  0 source , or possibly a proto - herbig - ae / be star .",
    "our higher resolution data show that mms  13 is a composite of smm  1a , 1b and 1c . as discussed above",
    ", we agree that smm  1b and 1c are probably protostellar . however , we believe that smm  1a may be prestellar in nature , due to the lack of a detection of a centimetre source coincident with smm  1a , and the low temperature obtained from the sed fitting . the low temperature indicates the lack of a central heating source .    to summarise , we believe that there are at least three sources in the immediate vicinity of irs  7 .",
    "the cm source vla  10a is the least embedded , and is the only source visible in the infrared .",
    "the extended envelope that is detected in the submillimetre , together with the presence of a mid - infrared source , leads us to believe that smm  1a is probably a class  i object .",
    "vla  10b has only been detected and resolved from nearby sources at cm wavelengths @xcite and in our scuba data ( smm  1b ) .",
    "this object is probably a class  0 protostar , as discussed above .",
    "the third source ( smm  1a ) is only detected in the submillimetre and at 1.2 mm , and we believe it to be prestellar in nature .      the majority of the other submillimetre sources in the region correspond to known young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "smm  2 was detected at 2@xmath14 m by @xcite though it was not identified as an association member .",
    "it is also seen as a shoulder on the side of mms  13 in the 1.2 mm map of , who suggested that it is a class  i object .",
    "smm  2 is shown in figure  [ models](a ) and ( c ) , and also in figure  [ composite ] labelled as ` wmb  55 ' .",
    "we have too few data - points to constrain the sed for this source , therefore can not determine the dust temperature .",
    "we concur with that the source is probably a class  i protostar and therefore use a canonical dust temperature of 30  k to determine the envelope mass ( see table  [ masses ] ) .",
    "smm  3 corresponds to the coronet member irs  1 @xcite , which is also known as hh100  irs .",
    "this is the driving source of the herbig - haro object hh100 @xcite , which was first discovered by @xcite .",
    "it has also been detected at a wavelength of 6  cm ( source vla  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "this source is seen as a shoulder on the side of mms  13 , though it is not resolved in the 1.2 mm data .",
    "irs has a rising sed between 2 and 25  @xmath0 m @xcite , indicating that it is a class  i protostar @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume a dust temperature of 30  k when calculating the envelope mass .",
    "this is quoted in table  [ masses ] .",
    "the source smm  4 is found in the filament stretching from smm  1 to the north - west , and is notably extended in the 14-arcsec jcmt beam .",
    "smm  4 coincides with the coronet member irs  5 @xcite .",
    "it has also been detected at 1.2  mm ( labelled mms  12 by ) , and at 6  cm ( labelled vla  7 by @xcite ) .",
    "smm  4 was not detected in the iras survey of the region @xcite .",
    "consequently the mid - infrared slope of its sed is not known .",
    "thus , the submillimetre and millimetre data do not constrain the dust temperature .",
    "its evolutionary status is therefore unclear .",
    "based on an interpolation between the near - infrared and submillimetre flux densities , we assign this source as a class i protostar , and therefore assume a temperature of 30  k.    smm  5 coincides with the coronet member irs  2 @xcite .",
    "this source has been detected at 1.2  mm ( labelled mms  9 by ) .",
    "mid - infrared observations show that it has a rising sed to longer wavelengths @xcite , indicating that this is a class  i protostar .",
    "smm  6 is the least centrally condensed source in our maps .",
    "the only other detection of this source is at 1.2 mm ( labelled mms  10 by ) .",
    "claim that mms  10 is probably a deeply embedded protostar .",
    "we argue that there is no indication of an embedded protostar ( e.g. infrared or cm source ) , and therefore hypothesise that the object is prestellar in nature .",
    "the millimetre and sub - millimetre data do not constrain the temperature of this object .",
    "therefore we calculate the dust mass for a temperature range of 1015  k ( typical for prestellar cores ",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "smm  7 corresponds to the t - tauri star s  cra @xcite .",
    "it is a strong source at millimetre wavelengths , and is the driving source of the herbig - haro object hh 82 @xcite .",
    "it is known to be a visual binary with a separation of 1.4 arcsec .",
    "it has been detected in the near and mid - infrared .",
    "the slope of its sed between 2 and 25  @xmath0 m indicates that it is a class ii yso . the envelope dust temperature for class ii sources",
    "is generally taken to be 30  k @xcite .",
    "this temperature is consistent with greybody fits ( equation  [ eqn_greybody ] ) to the far - infrared @xcite , submillimetre ( this study ) and millimetre flux densities .",
    "these data constrain the temperature to between 30 and 40  k. its mass is quoted in table  [ masses ] under the assumption of a temperature of 30  k.    smm  8 coincides with the source iras 18595 - 3712 , which has also been detected in the near and mid - infrared , and at millimetre wavelengths .",
    "it has the mid - infrared sed of a class i protostar .",
    "we therefore assume a dust temperature of 30  k @xcite . as for smm  7 ,",
    "this temperature is consistent with greybody fits to the far - infrared , submillimetre and millimetre data .",
    "smm  9 corresponds to the double star vv  cra @xcite , both components of which display t - tauri behaviour @xcite .",
    "the slope of its mid - infrared sed is approximately flat , possibly indicating a yso with an active or flared disk @xcite .",
    "the measured flux density from this source in the far - infrared @xcite , submillimetre ( this study ) and millimetre can be fitted with greybody curves corresponding to a temperature range of @xmath15  k. we therefore use the canonical 30  k when calculating the envelope mass for this source .",
    "we have mapped the r coronae australis molecular cloud at 450 and 850  @xmath0 m , and have compared these data to previous surveys of the region made at infrared , millimetre and centimetre wavelengths .",
    "we have discovered a new class  0 object .",
    "this object is associated with a cm source which was previously of an unknown nature .",
    "the protostar is separated by 0.01 pc from a second source that we hypothesise to be prestellar in nature .",
    "in addition , we have determined the envelope masses of a number of previously identified ysos and identified one further prestellar core .",
    "the authors would like to thank the staff of the jcmt for assistance with the observations .",
    "the jcmt is operated by the joint astronomy centre , hawaii , on behalf of the uk pparc , the netherlands nwo , and the canadian nrc .",
    "djn acknowledges pparc for pdra support ."
