    "it is usually very fruitful to explore the connection between classical and quantum mechanics but this connection is almost always done by going from classical mechanics toward quantum mechanics . here , we go the other way round and exhibit the classical analogue of the transition between the weisskopf - wigner exponential decay @xcite and the rabi oscillation @xcite : these two quantum mechanics regimes are very well known but it is only in 1977 that the existence of a continuous transition between them was exhibited by c. cohen - tannoudji and p. avan @xcite .",
    "this transition is described in detail in the book `` atom - photon interactions '' , by c. cohen - tannoudji , j. dupont - roc and g. grynberg @xcite . at first sight , these two regimes seem to be very different because the weisskopf - wigner exponential decay appears when a discrete state is coupled to a continuum while the rabi oscillation occurs when two discrete states are resonantly coupled .",
    "however , in the presence of the radiation continuum , any atomic system has only one discrete state , its ground state ( i.e. the atomic ground state and the radiation vacuum state ) , and all the excited atomic states are narrow continua with a width equal to their radiative natural width . as a consequence ,",
    "the rabi oscillation between the atomic ground and an excited state , treated as a discrete state , is an approximation of the real situation because the excited state is in fact a narrow continuum : this approximation is excellent for times shorter than the excited state lifetime and rabi oscillation is observed if the rabi period is shorter than the excited state lifetime .",
    "the weisskopf - wigner exponential decay is an excellent approximation in the opposite limit , when the rabi period is larger than the excited state lifetime .    in classical mechanics textbooks , the dynamics of two coupled mechanical oscillators",
    "is usually discussed without damping terms . in this case , the frequencies of the coupled oscillators present an avoided crossing , which is fully analogous to the avoided crossings of the eigenvalues of a hamiltonian @xcite and the dynamics , with a periodic exchange of energy between the two oscillators , is fully analogous to the rabi oscillation .",
    "however , in the absence of damping terms , it is not possible to observe the classical analogue of the weisskopf - wigner exponential decay .",

    "den hartog @xcite which studies the damping of an oscillator by coupling to another oscillator .",
    "this device , patented by h. frahm @xcite in 1911 , is now known as a `` tuned mass damper '' and it has many applications .",
    "however , this book does not consider the general case discussed here .",
    "in the present paper , we study theoretically two coupled oscillators with damping and we observe two limiting cases :    \\i ) if the coupling effect is dominant in a sense explained in section [ se4 ] , the mixing of the two oscillators is not substantially modified by the presence of damping . in particular , this mixing induces an averaging of the damping rates which are equal in the case of exact resonance . in this case , the dynamics remains an analogue of the rabi oscillation ;    \\ii ) if the damping effect is dominant , the mixing of the two oscillators is strongly modified by the presence of damping . in particular , if one of the two oscillators has a negligible damping rate , the situation is completely analogous to the coupling of a discrete state to a continuum : the damping rate of this oscillator , which is only due to its mixing with the other oscillator , decreases if the damping rate of the other oscillator increases .",
    "a similar result is observed in the weisskopf - wigner model , with the decay rate decreasing when the continuum width increases .",
    "the resonant frequency of this oscillator also presents variations , which are fully analogous to the frequency shift of a discrete level due to its coupling to a continuum .",

    "the two regimes discussed above appear to be fully similar to those observed in quantum mechanics when a discrete state is coupled to a continuum . as recalled in the introduction , there are two well - known limiting cases of this dynamics : the weisskopf - wigner exponential decay of the discrete state @xcite is a good approximation when the discrete state is weakly coupled to the continuum while the rabi oscillation between two discrete states @xcite is a good approximation if the continuum width is negligible .",

    "the density of states appearing in the fermi golden rule is inversely proportional to the width @xmath115 and , as a consequence , the decay rate of the discrete state is also @xmath118 .",
    "as @xmath115 gives the decay rate of a continuum wavepacket , the decay rate of the discrete state decreases when the decay rate of a continuum wavepacket increases .",
    "in addition , the coupling to the continuum also induces an energy shift , which is usually difficult to measure and this difficulty explains why it is rarely discussed .",
    "however , this shift is famous in the case of the lamb shift , first discovered in the @xmath119 level of of hydrogen @xcite and its discovery has played a very important role in the development of quantum electro - dynamics .",

    "here is an application of these ideas : we consider an atom in its ground state coupled by a resonant laser to one of its excited states .",
    "because of spontaneous emission , the excited state has a finite lifetime @xmath123 and it is a continuum of finite width @xmath124 .",
    "the discussion is simpler if we may neglect spontaneous emission toward the ground state .",
    "if the rabi frequency @xmath116 is weak , @xmath125 , the effect of the laser is to transfer ground state atoms in the excited state from which they never come back : this means that the laser has given a finite lifetime to the ground state and this lifetime , proportional to @xmath126 , increases when the excited lifetime proportional to @xmath123 decreases . in the opposite case of a strong coupling , @xmath125 ,",
    "the dynamics is described by a rabi oscillation with a period inversely proportional to @xmath116 and both states have the same lifetime equal to @xmath127 .",

    "the damping is shared , proportionally to the mixing induced by the coupling . *",
    "the original case occurs when the difference of damping rates dominates the coupling .",
    "then , the coupling has weaker effects on the frequencies and on the damping rates of the two oscillators .",
    "if the frequency of one oscillator is swept close to resonance , the real and imaginary parts of the frequencies of the coupled oscillators present resonant variations with lorentzian lineshapes , a dispersion lineshape for the real parts of the frequencies and an absorption lineshape for their imaginary parts .",
    "some damping is transferred from the more damped oscillator to the less damped one with a surprising result : the damping transferred decreases when the damping of the more damped oscillator increases .",
