    "the origin of short grbs is still being explored .",
    "short grbs are often detected at lower redshift because these bursts are less energetic .",
    "they constitute less than 20% of all detected grbs .",
    "the lack of supernova associations shows that at least some short grbs are not produced by massive star progenitors @xcite .    on theoretical grounds ,",
    "the mergers of compact binary objects have been investigated as a possible origin of short bursts @xcite .",
    "the compact object merger scenario is observationally supported by the location of short grbs within their host galaxies ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "the transition between short and long grbs at 2  s is somewhat arbitrary , and it is unclear how strongly it reflects differences in the progenitors of grbs .",
    "@xcite argued that the transition between short and long grbs is detector dependent , and collapsars may be found among the short grbs with some of the long grbs produced by non - collapsars .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : sourcesize ] we introduce a formalism to constrain the size of the emission region .",

    "however , the light curve variability is attributed to the activity of the central engine @xcite , and , as such , the minimum variability time scale provides a constraint on the maximum transverse extent of the emission region ( relative to the line - of - sight ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that grbs are powered by relativistic jets propagating with a speed @xmath7 and lorentz factor @xmath8 .",
    "the maximum transverse extent of the source is given by the relation @xmath9 where prime denotes quantities in the comoving frame of the emitting plasma , @xmath10 is the observed minimum variability time scale , @xmath11 is the cosmological redshift , and @xmath12^{-1}$ ] is the doppler factor of the observed radiation , with @xmath13 being the observer viewing angle relative to the velocity of the emitting material . for typical grbs , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "there are several methods for placing lower and upper limits on @xmath16 @xcite , which provide values in the range 20 - 3000 .",
    "the emission region has to be transparent to gamma rays .",
    "a small radius for the emission region and high photon densities imply a very large optical depth to @xmath17 absorption and pair creation @xcite . in order to allow gamma - ray photons to escape from the emission region , the optical depth for @xmath17 absorption , @xmath18 @xcite ,",

    "the spectral photon number density is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the luminosity distance to the source , @xmath30 is the observed energy flux ( also known as @xmath31 ) . combining equations ( [ eq : taugg ] ) and ( [ eq : ne ] ) , assuming the transverse extent of the emission region to be @xmath32 , gives the minimum doppler factor @xmath33 where @xmath34 the minimum lorentz factor , @xmath35 , required for gamma rays to escape from the emission region depends on the combination of the emitted and ambient photon energies .",

    "the gamma - ray burst detector ( gbm)@xcite on board the fermi satellite consists of 12 nai and 2 bgo scintillators which cover the energy range from 8 kev - 40 mev , in 128 energy bins , and monitor the entire sky .",
    "in the five years of its operation , the gbm triggered on more than 1300 grbs .",

    "we have therefore selected a limited sample of @xmath40 grbs with measured redshifts . of those ,",
    "only bursts with good spectral quality and light curves with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio were kept .",
    "the primary condition for the data selection was at least one light curve with signal - to - noise ratios greater than  2 at a sampling of 0.128@xmath41s .",
    "the selection procedure reduced the initial sample to 24  long grbs with measured redshifts .    to add short grbs , we have selected grbs detected by the gbm with duration @xmath2 is defined as the time interval over which 90% of the flux , integrated over the burst duration , was detected .",

    "the intrinsic minimum variability time scale of grbs is determined by the size of the emission region and the emission mechanism .",
    "the observed minimum variability time scales are , in addition , limited by the sensitivity of the detectors , the grbs flux and the sampling of light curves .",

    "the light curve is displayed with two different binnings , @xmath45s and @xmath46s , demonstrating how binning can smooth variability , or decrease signal - to - noise ratio .    to find the observed minimum variability time scale for each grb ,",
    "we have used the method utilized by @xcite , which searches for a characteristic time scale at which the variance ratios per bin width is minimum .",
    "the characteristic time scale is interpreted as an upper limit on the minimum variability time scale .",
    "this method incorporates the following steps : first , the time interval of the prompt emission is selected based on @xmath2 ; then , a background time interval of an equal duration is selected .",
    "both the signal and the background intervals are used to derive differentials , which , in the next step , are used to calculate variances of the signal and the background .",

    "the resulting minimum variability time scales for the entire sample are listed in table  [ tab : short ] .",
    "the variance ratio contains information on the rates of change in the light curves .",
    "these rates of change can decrease either because of the lack of further variability of the sources , or due to limited photon statistics .    to assess whether the observed minimum variability time scale can be intrinsic to the source ,",
    "we have calculated an average significance of the signal in the light curve for each binning , @xmath49 .",
    "if the average significance at the observed minimum variability time scale is @xmath50 , the observed variability time scale is interpreted as the intrinsic property of the emission region .",
    "the average significance , @xmath49 , of the light curve with a binning corresponding to @xmath10 is listed in table  [ tab : short ] for samples of long and short grbs .",

    "the observed variability time scales for long grbs are significantly longer than those of short grbs .",
    "this is in agreement with the minimum variability timescales of long and short grbs obtained by @xcite .",
    "the high significance obtained at @xmath10 suggests that for the majority of the long grbs in our sample , the observed variability time scale is not limited by the statistics . in the case of short grbs ,",
    "the average significance at the observed minimum variability time scale is small , suggesting that the intrinsic variability time scales for these grbs can be shorter than observed",

    "a hint of such a correlation is also present in our sample .",
    "however , as we have shown , the average significance at the characteristic variability timescale is small for short grbs .",
    "thus , the correlation can be the result of limited photon number statistics . in our sample ,",

    "following the formalism described in   [ sec : sourcesize ] , we have obtained the maximum and minimum transverse extents of the prompt emission regions for a sample of 19 short and 24 long grbs .",
    "table  [ tab : short ] lists the properties for each burst .    figure  [ fig : grbsize ] shows upper and lower limits on the transverse extent of the emission region as a function of the duration of the engine activity @xmath55 .",
    "the upper limits were obtained using equation  ( [ eq : size ] ) , where the minimum variability time scale was derived from the light curve analysis described in   [ sec : minvar ] , and the doppler factor was constrained using equation  ( [ eq : doppler ] ) .",
    "the energy flux , @xmath56 , was obtained by fitting the band function  @xcite to the spectrum .",
    "our constraints on the transverse extent of prompt emission region is based on the analysis of the minimum variability time scales and the doppler factors , which are evaluated using @xmath2 and the same energy range for all grbs .",

    "even if short grbs are located 5 times farther away , the observed size would be underestimated by merely a factor of 2 .",
    "the maximum transverse extent of the emission regions of long grbs is larger than that of short grbs by over an order of magnitude .",
    "thus , the assumed redshift for short grbs has little impact on our results .",
    "the minimum transverse extent of the emission region has been estimated differently for short and long grbs . for the majority of the long grbs ,",
    "the observed minimum variability time scale is not limited by the photon counting statistics , and thus may refer to the intrinsic variability of the source .",
    "therefore , the minimum transverse extent of the emission regions has been calculated as @xmath58 , assuming conservatively a minimum value of lorenz factor , @xmath35 , @xmath020 @xcite .",
    "the observed variability time scale for short grbs is limited by photon statistics ; thus the emission region can be smaller than estimated . to evaluate the minimum transverse extent of the emission region in the sample of short grbs , we have used equation  ( [ eq : rmin ] ) .",
    "the emission region of grbs is expected to expand close to the speed of light .",

    "the transverse extents have been estimated using the relation @xmath60 .",
    "the distribution of transverse extents is bimodal , with an average transverse extent of the emission regions of @xmath4 cm , and @xmath61 cm , for short and long grbs , respectively .",
    "these transverse extents are corrected for the redshift factor assuming the average redshift of z=0.85 @xcite for short grbs , and the average redshift of z=1.77 for long grbs listed in table  [ tab : short ] .",
    "the bimodality in the distribution of grb durations has been interpreted as evidence for two progenitor populations . in the collapsar scenario ,",
