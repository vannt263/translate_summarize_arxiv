    "stochastic processes are at the heart of many fundamental problems in statistical physics . in particular",
    ", it was realized a long time ago that brownian motion ( bm ) is the process underlying many physical systems and corresponding random models . since then , bm has not only become a cornerstone of statistical physics @xcite but has also found numerous applications in various areas of science , including biology @xcite , computer science @xcite or financial mathematics @xcite .",
    "these various applications have motivated the study of functionals of brownian motion @xcite , which are observables of the form @xmath16 where @xmath4 can be any function and @xmath0 is a bm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_brownian ] ( a ) ) .",
    "it might also be relevant to consider functionals of variants of bm , like the brownian bridge ( bb ) , @xmath17 , which is a bm conditioned to start and end at the origin ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_brownian ] ( b ) ) , the brownian excursion ( be ) , @xmath18 , which is a bb conditioned to stay positive on the whole time interval @xmath2 $ ] ( see fig . [ fig_brownian ] ( c ) ) as well as the brownian meander , @xmath19 , which is constrained to stay positive on @xmath2 $ ] but can end up at any point at time @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_brownian ] ( d ) ) .",
    "for instance , if @xmath21 , the brownian functional @xmath22 corresponds to the local time at the fixed level @xmath23 , which is an important quantity in probability theory @xcite .",
    "another interesting example concerns the case where @xmath24 for a be , which corresponds to the area under a be . in this case , the distribution of @xmath25 is given by the so called airy - distribution which appears in computer science @xcite as well as in the extreme statistics of elastic interfaces @xcite .",
    "extensions of the airy - distribution to the area under bessel processes ( _ i.e. _ , radius of the @xmath26-dimensional process ) have been recently discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "yet another example which is relevant in finance is the case where @xmath27 , which describes the price of an asian stock option in the black - scholes framework @xcite .",
    "note that in this exponential case , @xmath28 also represents the stationary current of a disordered sinai chain connected to two reservoirs of particles @xcite .",
    "quite interestingly , these functionals of bm and its variants can be studied using powerful tools of theoretical physics , namely path integrals methods ( leading to the so called feynman - kac formula ) .",
    "this allows to recast the study of brownian functionals in a quantum mechanical framework  @xcite .    while such brownian functionals are thus well understood , several recent works have pointed out the physical relevance of _ functionals of the maximum of brownian motion _ , which are much less studied . in this case",
    ", one is interested in observables of the form @xmath29 with @xmath1 where @xmath0 is bm or one of its variants ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_brownian ] ) .",
    "an important case corresponds to the case where @xmath5 where @xmath30 which is the so called density of states ( dos ) near the maximum .",
    "this is a natural and useful quantity to characterize the crowding of near - extremes  @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath31 denotes the amount of time spent by @xmath0 at a distance within the interval @xmath32 $ ] from @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_intro ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath7 is similar to the local time with the major difference that here the distances are measured from @xmath33 , which is itself a random variable .",
    "the statistics of the dos was recently studied by us in the context of near - extreme statistics @xcite .",
    "note that , by definition , @xmath34 .",
    "therefore its average value , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 means an average over the trajectories of bm has a natural probabilistic interpretation as it is the probability density function to find the bm at a given distance @xmath6 from the maximum in the time interval @xmath2 $ ] . in particular",
    ", the average value of any functional of the maximum can be expressed as @xmath37 which naturally holds not only for bm but also for its variants , like brownian bridge or brownian excursion .",
    "another very interesting application of functionals of the maximum of brownian motion concerns the case where @xmath38 , which enters into the analysis of the optimal algorithm to find the maximum of a discrete random walk of @xmath39 steps with @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "indeed , let us consider a discrete random walk ( rw ) , starting from @xmath41 and evolving via the markov rule : @xmath42 where @xmath43 with equal probability @xmath44 .",
    "we study the search problem of finding the maximum of the rw , @xmath45 , while minimizing the number of values of @xmath46 s that are probed .",
    "the cost of the algorithm is identified by the number of probes used to find @xmath47 .",
    "the simplest algorithm consists of probing all positions @xmath46 for @xmath48 : its cost is @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "[ exemple_algo ] , we show an example for @xmath49 where we find @xmath50 in @xmath51 probes : this shows that , because of strong correlations between the positions of the rw , @xmath39 is actually a rough upper bound of the cost of the optimal algorithm .",
    "of course , some rws need more probes than others in order to find @xmath47 . for example , the rw with @xmath39 jumps @xmath52 needs only one probe in @xmath53 but the rw with alternating jumps @xmath54 ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) needs @xmath57 probes to be sure that none @xmath58 .",
    "but of course these cases are rare .",
    "let @xmath59 be the ensemble of algorithms that find @xmath47 , according to the above rules , and let us denote by @xmath60 the cost , as defined above , of the algorithm @xmath23 that belongs to @xmath59 .",
    "of course @xmath60 is a random variable , which varies from one realization of the rw to another , its average value being denoted by @xmath61 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , odlyzko studied the minimal average cost of such algorithms and he showed that , for large @xmath39 , the minimal average cost is proportional to @xmath62 , much smaller than the cost of the aforementioned naive algorithm , which necessitates @xmath39 probes .",
    "indeed , one has @xcite",
    "@xmath63 where @xmath64 is a constant given by @xmath65 } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence the relevance of the functional of the maximum with @xmath66 for this search problem .",
    "note that odlyzko found an expression of @xmath64 in terms of a complicated double integral which was then evaluated independently by hwang @xcite and chassaing @xcite to be @xmath67 furthermore , odlyzko found an algorithm , denoted as od(@xmath39 ) , belonging to @xmath59 , such that @xmath68 hence eqs .",
    "( [ average_cost ] ) and ( [ average_odlyzko ] ) show that odlyzko s algorithm od(@xmath39 ) is on average asymptotically optimal . in a subsequent work , chassaing , marckert and",
    "yor showed that od(@xmath39 ) is not only asymptotically optimal on average ( [ average_odlyzko ] ) but also in distribution @xcite , which means the following .",
    "if one defines @xmath69 as @xmath70 then one has for any @xmath71 @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the random variable defined above in ( [ def_i ] ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors studied the distribution of @xmath73 as well as its moments , using rather involved probabilistic methods .",
    "we will show here how these results can be derived simply using path integrals techniques .    yet another case of a functional of the maximum , @xmath74 , corresponds to the case where @xmath75 . in this case @xmath74 describes the largest exit time of a particle , of unit mass , moving ballistically through a random potential on the segment @xmath76 $ ] ( at zero temperature ) .",
    "consider indeed a random brownian potential @xmath77 over a line segment @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "imagine shooting a classical particle of unit mass with fixed energy @xmath79 from the left of the segment at @xmath80 .",
    "the energy conservation leads to @xmath81 clearly , this classical particle can penetrate the region @xmath78 $ ] if and only if its energy @xmath79 is bigger than the maximum value of the potential @xmath77 over @xmath78 $ ] , i.e. , if @xmath82 where @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "now , imagine sending a beam of classical particles with varying energy through this potential barrier .",
    "only those particles with energy larger than @xmath84 will go through the barrier . the time taken for such a penetrating particle to exit the region",
    "@xmath78 $ ] through its right can be computed from eq .",
    "( [ energy_cons.1 ] ) as @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "clearly , the time needed by a penetrating particle to cross the region @xmath78 $ ] depends on the energy @xmath79 of the particle .",
    "the slowest particle , i.e. , the one that takes the longest time to cross , is the one that has the lowest allowed energy to penetrate , i.e. , the one with energy @xmath87 .",
    "hence , the maximum time needed by a particle to cross the barrier is given by    @xmath88= [ { \\mathcal t}(x_{\\rm max})]= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ , \\int_0 ^ 1 \\frac{dy}{\\sqrt{x_{\\rm max}-x(y ) } } \\ ; , \\ ] ]    which thus corresponds to a functional of the maximum of bm , @xmath89 , with @xmath90 .",
    "in view of these two interesting physical examples in eqs .",
    "( [ def_i ] ) and ( [ time_ballistic ] ) , it is rather natural to consider the family of functionals of the maximum of bm @xmath74 with @xmath91 such that @xmath92 indexed by a real @xmath93 - 2,\\infty[$ ] .",
    "note that , by using the self - affinity of bm , @xmath94 .",
    "in particular for @xmath15 this corresponds to @xmath73 in ( [ def_i ] ) while for @xmath95 this corresponds to @xmath96 in ( [ time_ballistic ] ) . on the other hand , for @xmath97 , @xmath98",
    "is called the area under a brownian double meander @xcite .",
    "for other values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 generalizes these three cases .    of course",

    "hence @xmath103 is distributed according to the airy distribution , discussed above @xcite . for @xmath95 ,",
    "this yields again the maximal time spent by particles to pass through a disordered periodic potential which is a brownian bridge .",
    "finally we conjecture , following the lines of reasoning of refs .",
    "@xcite , that for @xmath15 , i. e. the equivalent of @xmath73 in ( [ def_i ] ) where @xmath0 is replaced by @xmath17 and @xmath33 by @xmath100 , @xmath104 yields the cost of the optimal algorithm to find the maximum of a random walk bridge ( see appendix [ odl_bridge ] ) .",
