    "<S> we report on the generation of more than 5 db of vacuum squeezed light at the rubidium d1 line ( 795 nm ) using periodically poled ktiopo@xmath0 ( ppktp ) in an optical parametric oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate squeezing at low sideband frequencies , making this source of non - classical light compatible with bandwidth limited atom optics experiments . when ppktp is operated as a parametric amplifier , we show a noise reduction of 4 db stably locked within the 150 khz-500 khz frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> this matches the bandwidth of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in rubidium hot vapour cells under the condition of large information delay .    </S>",
    "<S> the control of quantum states of light is of great interest for quantum communication purposes . </S>",
    "<S> many quantum information protocols rely on the possibility of coherently delaying and storing the information carried by a laser beam . </S>",
    "<S> this can for example be achieved using electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimental and theoretical studies have shown that information can be delayed within a narrow bandwidth when light interacts with atoms in a lambda configuration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one step further is the delay of quantum information , carried by squeezed or entangled light states , through such a system . to achieve this goal a source of light with non - classical photon statistics at low sideband frequencies tuned to atomic transitions </S>",
    "<S> is required . </S>",
    "<S> other applications of low frequency squeezing in atom optics include the generation of continuous variable entanglement between an atom laser beam and an optical field . </S>",
    "<S> this can be realized via outcoupling of atoms from a bose - einstein condensate using squeezed light in a raman transition @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> many of these atom optics experiments are performed using transitions at the rubidium d1 line at 795 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of squeezing at these wavelengths has therefore been the subject of many experimental efforts involving either atomic interactions in rubidium or by using the @xmath1 interaction in non - linear media . </S>",
    "<S> squeezing via self - rotation in thermal vapour cells @xcite was shown to be a challenge , since atomic noise reduces the amount of squeezing that could be observed . </S>",
    "<S> relative intensity squeezing of up to 3.5 db generated by four - wave mixing in rb vapour has been shown recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when using @xmath1 non - linear media for the squeezed light generation , it is difficult to identify materials that have high non - linearities and negligible passive losses , as the second harmonic of the rb d1 line , 397.5 nm light , approaches the uv cut - off wavelength of many non - linear optical media . periodically poling on the other hand allows to tailor the properties of non - linear media so that quasi phase matching can be achieved for any desired optical frequency . </S>",
    "<S> early experiments used periodically poled material in waveguide form which offers a high non - linearity and an extended interaction length </S>",
    "<S> . however , losses in waveguides are higher than in bulk material due to technological issues . to date , 0.9 db of squeezing at 795 nm </S>",
    "<S> have been reported using waveguides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ktiopo@xmath0 ( ktp ) presents a high non - linearity together with a good transmission at 397.5 nm which makes periodically poled ktp ( ppktp ) a good candidate for experiments at the d1 rubidium line . </S>",
    "<S> more recent experiments showed the great potential of squeezed state generation in parametric downconversion using ppktp . </S>",
    "<S> more than 7 db of quadrature squeezing has been reported at 860 nm @xcite , while at 795 nm , to date 2.75 db of squeezed vaccum has been observed @xcite .    here , we report on improvements on the generation of squeezing at rubidium wavelengths and show more than 5 db of quantum noise suppression of a vacuum field using optical parametric oscillation ( opo ) . by operating our system with a seed beam of low power ( i. e. by running the opo as an amplifier , opa ) </S>",
    "<S> , we locked the system to deamplification and show more than 4 db of amplitude quadrature squeezing down to 150 khz which makes this non - classical light source suitable for atom optics experiments .        in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> ( set - up see fig.([setup ] ) ) we used a ti : sapphire laser ( coherent mbr ) tuned to 795 nm to pump a second - harmonic generator ( shg ) , to seed the opa , and to provide a local oscillator for the homodyne detection system . </S>",
    "<S> for both the shg and the opa bow - tie cavities with ppktp crystals of length 20 mm and cross - section 1@xmath22 mm@xmath3 were used . </S>",
    "<S> the cavities had a 600 mm round trip perimeter and two curved mirrors ( 100 mm radius of curvature ) giving a waist of 40 @xmath4 m inside the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> with these parameters a single pass efficiency of @xmath52.7@xmath6 w@xmath7 for the ppktp crystal was measured . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 and @xmath9 refer to the pump power at the fundamental and the second harmonic field respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the waist size was chosen to minimize thermal effects whilst still providing enough uv light being generated in the shg . to simplify mode - matching , </S>",
    "<S> the opa cavity was of identical geometry to the shg . by varying the temperature of the crystals between 20 and 50@xmath10c we were able to produce uv light over a range of 1.5 nm around 795.3 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the shg cavity was pumped with 300 mw of infrared light via a 82 % reflectivity flat input coupling mirror . at a phase matching temperature of around 20@xmath10c , uv light at 397.5 </S>",
    "<S> nm was efficiently generated . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum second harmonic conversion efficiency reached in that regime was up to 50@xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the locking was done by detecting the transmitted pump using pound drever hall ( pdh ) techniques @xcite by applying a phase modulation on the pump at 10.4 mhz using pm1 . </S>",
    "<S> the second harmonic light was coupled out from the shg through one of the curved mirrors and was mode matched to the opa cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we observed that our ppktp crystal is prone to grey tracking when it is used for shg at higher power density levels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we noticed a degradation in the efficiency of the frequency doubler as well as a distortion of the mode shape of the second harmonic output field after operating the shg over a longer period of time . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of grey tracking was partly reversed by slowly heating the crystal up to around 120@xmath10c and baking it for a period of several days as suggested in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . to minimize grey tracking effects , </S>",
    "<S> we restricted the amount of uv light produced to around 50 mw . operation in this regime also minimized photo thermal effects in the shg cavity and allowed for a more stable locking . while grey tracking was observed in shg with its relative high power density levels involved , we observed no deterioration of the non - linear crystal when it was used in a sub - threshold opa .    </S>",
    "<S> a mode cleaning cavity was used to generate a tem@xmath12 beam . </S>",
    "<S> this facilitated the mode matching of the beams into the opa cavity and ensured a high interference contrast in the homodyne detection . </S>",
    "<S> as the opa cavity was highly impedance mismatched , deriving an error signal from the reflected seed was more difficult and yielded non optimum locking . </S>",
    "<S> the opa cavity length was therefore locked on resonance using an auxiliary beam propagating in the opposite direction to the pump beam as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ setup ] . </S>",
    "<S> the modulator pm2 provided phase modulation sidebands at @xmath13 mhz allowing the generation of a pdh error signal for the opa cavity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , locking the cavity via the counter propagating beam allowed for the stable generation of vacuum squeezing as the cavity length can be locked independently from the seed .    </S>",
    "<S> the opa was pumped through one of the curved mirrors . after optimizing the mode matching of the pump into the cavity we measured a threshold of around 25 mw , with an output coupler of 95% . </S>",
    "<S> the total losses inside the opa are then estimated to be around 0.5% . </S>",
    "<S> for the actual squeezed state generation , we changed the reflectivity of the output coupling mirror to 92% . </S>",
    "<S> this enhances the squeezing escape efficiency , which we calculate to be 93% . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding theoretical threshold is now 68 mw . </S>",
    "<S> we pumped our opa with 40 mw . </S>",
    "<S> a parametric gain of around 10 was observed in that regime . in the first step we blocked the seed , thus running the opa as an opo to generate a squeezed vacuum state . </S>",
    "<S> the squeezing was measured with a homodyne detection scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the mode matching between the local oscillator and the opa output was 97@xmath11 and the photodiode quantum efficiency was around 95@xmath11 . the overall efficiency , also taking into account the escape efficiency of the squeezing from the cavity , yielded 83@xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ macdonalds ] shows the homodyne detection signal measured in zero span mode at 400 khz with a spectrum analyser , when the phase of the local oscillator was scanned . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution bandwidth was 30 khz and the video bandwidth 100 hz . </S>",
    "<S> this curve shows a noise reduction of 5.2 db @xmath14 0.4 db below the quantum noise limit when correcting for electronic noise ( which is 10 db below the quantum noise level defined by our local oscillator beam ) , the anti - squeezing level is 12 db @xmath14 0.4 db .        </S>",
    "<S> next , we seeded the opo to run it as a parametric amplifier . </S>",
    "<S> to generate squeezing at a particular quadrature , the phases of the pump beam and of the local oscillator with respect to the seed beam need to be controlled . </S>",
    "<S> we chose to lock the pump phase to deamplify the seed and thus generate an amplitude squeezed beam . </S>",
    "<S> the locking signal was derived from the phase modulation signal of the seed beam at 5.6 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> this modulation signal was transmitted through the cavity via the seed beam and measured on the two homodyne detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the sum signal of the detectors was then demodulated and low pass filtered thus providing an error signal to lock the pump phase with respect to the seed beam . as we wanted to measure the amplitude quadrature of the squeezed beam , the homodyne detector needed to be locked to the bright / dark fringe . </S>",
    "<S> the same phase modulation signal at 5.6 mhz which was used for locking to deamplification was also used to lock the homodyne detection . </S>",
    "<S> the locking signal was obtained via the difference signal of the photocurrents of the two detectors . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ locked].a ) shows the evolution of the squeezing spectrum measured at sideband frequencies within the cavity bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum noise suppression gets more efficient at low frequencies as expected . at sideband frequencies below 1 mhz , technical noise is coupled into the system .    </S>",
    "<S> the ultimate sources of noise limiting the low frequency performance of the squeezer are the noise on the seed and , noise of the pump coupled onto the squeezed beam when the opa is seeded . at such low frequencies , </S>",
    "<S> most of the lasers show technical noise ( see inset b ) in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> locked ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> different techniques have been proposed and implemented to overcome these issues . </S>",
    "<S> one approach relies on interferometric cancellation of common mode noise , either by interference of two squeezed beams from two opas which were seeded by the same laser on a symmetric beam splitter , @xcite or by placing a squeezer inside a mach - zehnder configuration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively the seed power level can be reduced . </S>",
    "<S> this minimises the technical noise at low frequencies on the seed beam , but also reduces the coupling of noise from the pump onto the squeezed field @xcite . in the limit of zero power in the seed , </S>",
    "<S> no noise is coupled to the squeezed field , however , to lock the local oscillator to a particular quadrature , a different locking technique such as quantum noise locking @xcite has to be employed . </S>",
    "<S> quantum noise locking requires the detection of the squeezing spectrum over a large bandwidth , which is incompatible with bandwidth limited atomic systems . </S>",
    "<S> to lock the squeezer to deamplification , we therefore reduced the power level of the seed beam to minimise the noise coupling onto the squeezed beam while still being able to generate large enough error signals . </S>",
    "<S> as the locking stability of the system , on the other hand , relies on the total power in the seed , a compromise between seed power and coupling of low frequency noise into the squeezed beam and locking stability needed to be found . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ locked].c ) , the low frequency part of the squeezing spectrum is plotted . </S>",
    "<S> more than 3 db of amplitude squeezing were measured at sideband frequencies down to 150 khz . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here were obtained with a seed power of 2 @xmath4w whilst we were still able to lock stably the set - up for a few minutes .        </S>",
    "<S> our main motivation for the generation of squeezing at atomic wavelengths is to study the performance of eit in rubidium to delay and store quantum information . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of delay possible in such atomic systems at a given sideband frequency is governed by the dispersion properties , which in turn are linked via the kramers kronig relation to the transmission bandwidth . for a quantum delay line to be efficient , </S>",
    "<S> passive losses must be avoided . </S>",
    "<S> thus , useful sideband frequencies where the information is encoded are limited to the sub - megahertz regime . with our squeezing source at hand , it should be possible to demonstrate the delay of quantum information at a sideband frequency of 150 khz by @xmath15s with only moderate losses of 20% @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent sudies showed that additional sources of decoherence might limit the performance of such systems further , i. e. restrict the transmission and also add extra noise @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our aim was therefore to produce large stably locked squeezing at such low ( sub - mhz ) frequencies to probe the capabilities of eit as a quantum information delay line .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated @xmath16 db of vacuum squeezing at the rubidium d1 line using optical parametric oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> ppktp was used as the non - linear crystal for frequency doubling and down conversion . </S>",
    "<S> we were able to stably lock the opa to generate amplitude squeezing in the frequency range compatible with bandwidth limited atom optics experiments . </S>",
    "<S> around 4 db of quantum noise suppression was achieved in a frequency range from 150 khz to 500 khz . the low frequency performance is currently limited by laser noise which couples onto the squeezed beam . the use of an intensity stabilized laser source and the application of an external intensity noise eater should lead to further improvements of the low frequency squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> already now , the squeezing generated gives us the possibility to efficiently examine the quantum performance of eit - based delay lines .    </S>",
