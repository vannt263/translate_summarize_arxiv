    "the study of parity nonconservation ( pnc ) in atoms provides a low - energy search for new physics beyond the standard model ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , which is a relatively inexpensive alternative to the high - energy searches performed in colliders .",
    "in fact , pnc in cesium is currently the most precise low - energy test of the electroweak theory due to the high accuracy of the measurements  @xcite and the calculations needed for their interpretation  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the level of precision that has been obtained in atomic physics calculations and measurements has meant that strong - field qed corrections are observable and must be taken into account .",
    "it was shown in fact , that the inclusion of self - energy - type qed corrections to pnc calculations in cesium restored the agreement with the standard model  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . just as these calculations have proven to be important in the case of cesium",
    ", they will be necessary for the calculations of other atoms as the accuracy increases and as new experiments become available .",
    "for this reason , using the `` radiative potential '' method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we present calculations of the qed corrections to the pnc amplitudes of several transitions in rb , cs , ba@xmath0 , tl , fr and ra@xmath0 .",
    "the case of rubidium is interesting because of its simple electron structure and small value of different corrections to the pnc amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the pnc measurements for rb can be more reliable than for other atoms .",
    "we have shown in our previous work  @xcite that the accuracy of the calculations for rubidium can surpass those for cesium , while the pnc amplitude is only several times smaller  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "francium is a particularly important application .",
    "the frpnc collaboration has begun the construction of a laser cooling and trapping apparatus at the triumf laboratories in canada with the purpose of measuring atomic parity nonconservation in artificially produced francium  @xcite . with a pnc amplitude expected to be around 15 times larger than that of cesium , and its relatively simple electronic configuration which leads to accurate calculations",
    ", francium is an ideal atom for precision measurements of pnc  @xcite .",
    "when these measurements become available it will be very important to have accurate atomic calculations for analysis , and these calculations will require contributions from quantum electrodynamics effects .",
    "there are accurate calculations and measurements available for thallium  @xcite , and measurements have also been considered for the ba@xmath0 ion  @xcite and are in progress for the ra@xmath0 ion  @xcite .",
    "the quantum electrodynamics corrections considered in this work arise from vacuum polarization and elec- tron self - energy . the inclusion of vacuum polarization is numerically relatively simple ,",
    "achieved via inclusion of the uehling potential .",
    "the self - energy contribution is in- cluded via the radiative potential method developed in ref .",
    "note that the radiative correction to the electric dipole transition operator @xmath1 ( vertex correction ) is very small and may be neglected .",
    "the change of the electric dipole matrix elements come from the qed corrections to the electron wave functions .",
    "the parity nonconservation amplitude of a transition ( @xmath2 ) between states of the same parity can be expressed via the sum over all possible intermediate opposite parity states @xmath3 , @xmath4 ,      \\label{eq : pnc}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the electric dipole transition operator and @xmath6 is the nuclear - spin - independent weak interaction .      in the original works , qed corrections",
    "were only calculated for the weak matrix elements ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this was a reasonable approximation numerically for cesium due to a chance cancellation between qed contributions coming from corrections to the energy levels and dipole matrix elements , which were calculated by flambaum and ginges  @xcite .",
    "this cancellation is not guaranteed and it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that corrections from all three sources are equally important and must be included .",
    "full determinations of qed corrections to the entire pnc amplitude have only been considered for cesium @xcite .",
    "the radiative potential method , developed by flambaum and ginges  @xcite , defines an approximate potential @xmath7 such that the radiative correction to the energies coincides with its average value , @xmath8 this potential takes into account the local vacuum polarization operator ( including the lowest - order in @xmath9 uehling potential as well as the higher order wichmann - kroll potential ) and the non - local strong coulomb field electron self - energy operator .    in this work , we use the existing calculations of qed corrections to the weak matrix elements , which are presented in table  [ tab : weak ] .",
    "these values have been taken from the works ref s",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "midpoints and uncertainties have been chosen to agree with different previous determinations .",
    "note also that these calculations are valid only for @xmath10-@xmath11 weak transitions .",
    "we then use the radiative potential method outlined above , with the exception of the small wichmann - kroll term , to calculate the qed corrections to the energy levels and electric dipole matrix elements .",
    "we then calculate the dominating terms in equation ( [ eq : pnc ] ) with and without the radiative corrections to determine the total percentage correction to the pnc amplitudes for several transitions in rb , cs , ba@xmath0 , tl , fr and ra@xmath0 .",
    ".values ( from ref s @xcite ) for the percentage contributions of vacuum polarization including the uehling and smaller wichmann - kroll ( w - k ) potentials , and self - energy - vertex ( se - v ) to weak @xmath10-@xmath12 matrix elements for various atoms .",
    "uncertainty is estimated from the spread of values of different sources . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      despite the fact that there are some individual corrections in the atoms that are quite large , there is significant cancellation between contributions from the weak matrix elements and the combined contributions from the energies and dipoles in most of the transitions presented .",
    "this causes the total qed contributions in most atoms to be highly suppressed .",
    "the uncertainty of the total qed corrections to the pnc amplitudes come from uncertainties of all three sources ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) added in quadrature .",
    "the uncertainty of the first term ( @xmath13 ) has been estimated in  @xcite .",
    "the estimation of uncertainties for two other terms ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) comes from the spread of values of the qed correction found in different approximations ( rpa , brueckner , etc . ) .",
