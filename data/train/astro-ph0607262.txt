    "in the last two decades , observations of high redshift supernovae  @xcite showed that the expansion of the universe is undergoing a phase of positive acceleration . together with measurements of large scale structure  @xcite and of anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )",
    "temperature and polarization  @xcite , these data can be explained if about 70 % of the energy density of our universe is made up by a component with negative pressure , dubbed dark energy ( de ) .",
    "the basic candidate for de is the cosmological constant , @xmath0 , with an equation of state @xmath4 . as showed by the three - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations  @xcite , a power ",
    "law @xmath0cdm model with adiabatic initial conditions is a good fit to most cosmological data  @xcite . within",
    "the framework of a @xmath0cdm cosmology , the combination of the three - year wmap ( wmap3 ) observations with lss and snia data , allowed to measure several fundamental cosmological parameters with percent accuracy .",
    "however , a cosmological constant has severe problems on theoretical grounds , in particular fine  tuning and cosmic coincidence .",
    "several alternatives to a cosmological constants have been proposed , including a perfect fluid with constant @xmath5 ; self  interacting scalar fields , with a time depending @xmath6 ( quintessence  @xcite ) or @xmath7 ( phantom  @xcite ) , or with non  canonical kinetic term ( k  essence  @xcite ; quintom  @xcite ) ; modifications of general relativity  @xcite .",
    "quintessence models are particularly interesting due to the existence of _ tracker _ potentials . under the proper assumptions for the potential  @xcite",
    ", the energy density of quintessence follows closely the evolution of the dominant component , though decreasing more slowly .",
    "in addition , the scalar field evolution does not depend on the initial conditions , lessening fine  tuning and related problems . on the contrary , dynamics depend on the current energy density of de and on the shape of the scalar field potential @xmath8 and its parameters , which should be added to the usual cosmological ones during data analysis .",
    "several authors used a combination of wmap3 data and other cosmological data , to study de properties .",
    "the wmap team placed constraints on the value of @xmath9 , assumed constant , while other works studied the evolution of @xmath10  @xcite , or assumed phenomenological parameterization for @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting constraints may depend on the choice of parameterization ( e.g.  @xcite ) and , in general , do not translate directly into constraints on the shape of the potential .    in this work we use recent cosmological data to directly constrain the shape of two classes of quintessence potentials : the ratra",

    "in the limit of spatial homogeneity , the equation of motion for a quintessence scalar field @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where dots denote derivatives with respect to conformal time @xmath14 , the hubble parameter @xmath15 , and we used natural units , @xmath16 .",
    "the energy and pressure associated with the field are given by @xmath17 together with friedman equations ,   and   allow to solve for the background evolution in a quintessence cosmology , once the the potential @xmath8 , and the density parameters of the different components @xmath18 , @xmath19 , etc .",
    ", are assigned . at variance with a cosmological constant ,",
    "quintessence is not a smooth component and perturbations in the scalar field need to be accounted for  @xcite . in the synchronous gauge",
    "they obey the equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the trace part of the metric perturbation .",
    "perturbation evolution is also fixed by the potential .",
    "quintessence cosmologies , then , clearly depend on shape of @xmath8 , which in principle is totally arbitrary . considering",
    "only tracker potentials allow to ease the fine tuning problem of @xmath0cdm cosmologies .",
    "as said in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , in this work we focus on two classes of tracker potentials , rp and sugra : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the planck mass .",
    "the former was one of the first tracker potentials studied , and is characterized by a slowly varying equation of state .",
    "the latter originates within the context of supergravity theories and the corresponding equation of state undergoes a rapid transition when the field becomes dominant .",
    "both potentials depend on two parameters , the slope @xmath25 and the energy scale @xmath1 . for a given choice of parameters , the scalar field associated with",
    "the two potentials evolve in a similar way until the epoch of de domination ; at that point in a sugra model @xmath11 rapidly falls toward values @xmath26 , while in a rp model @xmath11 decreases more slowly , and stays at considerably higher values .    in a cosmological context , @xmath25 and @xmath1",
    "are not independent ; fixing the current energy density of de , @xmath27 , leaves only one free parameter .",
    "notice that for @xmath28 , we recover the behaviour of the cosmological constant . here",
    ", we take @xmath1 as a free parameter ; however , different conventions are possible  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we test rp and sugra models using recent data , and try to place constraints on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "we assume a power  law spectrum of primordial density fluctuations with adiabatic initial conditions , and restrict our analysis to flat cosmologies with no massive neutrinos , so that @xmath29 .",
    "the models studied are thus specified by seven parameters : the physical baryon , @xmath30 , and cdm , @xmath31 , densities ; the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination @xmath32 ; the slope , @xmath33 , and amplitude , @xmath34 , of the power  spectrum of density fluctuations ; the optical depth to reionization , @xmath14 ; and @xmath35 .",
    "notice that @xmath36 is the reduced hubble parameter , @xmath37km / s / mpc .",
    "this choice of parameters is particularly efficient in minimizing the impact of the degeneracies of cmb angular power spectra on data analysis  @xcite . to explore the parameter space , we used a modified version of the cosmomc package .",
    "we assumed a flat priors on all parameters ; in particular @xmath38 .",
    "the upper limit corresponds to the planck mass , while the lower one is set by @xmath39 , i.e. the cosmological constant energy density in a concordance @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we also tested that a different choice of priors , in particular using @xmath40 instead of @xmath32 , does not significantly alter our results .",
    "models were tested against wmap3 data , the galaxy power spectrum @xmath41 of the full 2df galaxy redshift survey  @xcite and the distance measurements to high - redshift supernovae by the supernova legacy survey ( snsl  @xcite ) .",
    "assuming the three sets of data to be independent , the total likelihood is the product of the individual likelihoods @xmath42 we also define an effective @xmath43 .    in the analysis of the cmb anisotropy spectrum , the wmap team included the contribution of secondary anisotropies due to sunayev ",
    "zeldovich ( sz ) effect  @xcite .",
    "the sz contribution was parametrized in term of the amplitude of the signal , @xmath44 , relative to a reference @xmath0cdm model and final constraints were obtained after marginalization over @xmath44 .",
    "the effects of sz marginalization on @xmath0cdm estimates are very small .",
    "in addition , the sz contribution depends on the mass function and its evolution ; these , in turn , depend on the quintessence model considered and require extensive numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "thus , we set @xmath45 here .",
    "we also did not include small scale data in our analysis of cmb anisotropies .",
    "s mostly probe the recombination history and the running of the spectral index , but are not significantly affected by the quintessence models we considered .",
    "analysis of lss data requires the introduction of an additional parameter , @xmath47 , accounting for the bias in the clustering of galaxies with respect to the clustering of the matter field . here",
    ", we assume that @xmath47 is independent of scale in the range of @xmath48 considered  @xcite , and the code performs an analytic marginalization over it . in these range of wavenumbers",
    "non  linear corrections are small  @xcite , and we do not include them in the analysis . for both sugra and rp potentials we run 10 chains of @xmath49 points each .",

    "this constraint does not directly translate into a constraint on the energy scale @xmath156 , as the @xmath25@xmath1 relation depends on @xmath157 .",
    "however , it was clear that allowed values fall well below the @xmath158gev range , which includes the electroweak ( ew ) and ( possibly ) the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking scales .",
    "let us outline soon that wmap3 data do not improve this situation .",
    "while a sugra potential still provides a fair fit of data for a physically relevant range of @xmath1 values , this is not so for rp .",
    "we therefore confirm that sugra is still a viable cosmology ; on the contrary , while rp is compatible with data , the cosmology it yields has just minor differences from @xmath0cdm .",
    "let us then discuss first the sugra case , which leads to relevant shifts of some parameters in respect to @xmath0cdm .      a first point to be outlined",
    "is that there is no appreciable difference between the likelihood of sugra and @xmath0cdm , as the @xmath159 value , for sugra , is only very marginally improved .",
    "when only wmap3 data are considered , the range of allowed @xmath160 values is essentially unconstrained : @xmath161 , at the 95% confidence level . considering the whole set of data ,",
    "the limit is significantly more stringent : @xmath162 at 95% c.l .",
    "assuming for the other parameters their expectation values , @xmath163 corresponds to @xmath164 .",
    "the strong difference from rp is due to the fact that , at late times , when @xmath12 approaches the planck mass , the exponential term dominates the potential , smoothing the dependence on the energy scale .",
    "as far as other parameters are concerned , mean values and confidence intervals are different from @xmath0cdm ; shifts are more relevant for @xmath33 , @xmath82 and @xmath165 .",
    "the shift of the primeval spectral index @xmath33 , in particular , affects the impact of wmap3 data on the nature of inflation  @xcite . using the whole data set , we find for @xmath0cdm : @xmath166 while for sugra : @xmath167 here",
    "we have quoted the mean , the 68% and 95% c.l .",
    "errors ; the 95% errors include the contribution from the 68% uncertainty .",
    "these figures show that a zeldovich spectrum , excluded at the 95% c.l .",
    "( @xmath168 ) , if @xmath0cdm models are considered , is compatible with the whole data set ( @xmath169 ) , at the same confidence level , for sugra cosmologies ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "more in detail , let us outline that , when using only wmap3 data , constraints on @xmath82 , @xmath165 and @xmath170 are very poor , in qualitative agreement with results for wmap1 data  @xcite . in particular , @xmath171km / s / mpc , @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "this is due to a strong degeneracy between @xmath51 and @xmath82 , which in turn affects estimates of @xmath165 and @xmath170 , as shown in  .",
    "this degeneracy is qualitatively similar to the geometric @xmath9@xmath82 degeneracy in models with a constant equation of state .",
    "fixing all other parameters , the effective value of @xmath174 , is an increasing function of @xmath156 and the field becomes dominant at earlier times than in @xmath0cdm . when fitting cmb data , this behaviour yields higher @xmath175 and lower @xmath170 as @xmath1 increases .",
    "notice that there is no one  to  one relation @xmath1@xmath11 , and results for models with constant @xmath9 can not be straightforwardly applied to constrain the energy scale .",
    "the main difference between wmap1 and wmap3 constraints is in the marginalized distribution of @xmath33 and @xmath14 .",
    "the integrated sachs ",
    "wolfe effect acts on low@xmath46 anisotropy multipoles more strongly in sugra than in @xmath0cdm . in wmap1 , this increases the @xmath14@xmath33 degeneracy , and both @xmath14 and @xmath33 are quite higher for sugra than for @xmath0cdm .",
    "wmap3 estimates of te and ee spectra allows a firm determination of @xmath14 , and considering dynamical de does not significantly worsen constraints on @xmath14 and @xmath33 .    including other datasets in the analysis",
    "strongly reduces the allowed range for @xmath1 , in turn significantly affecting the estimates of parameters degenerate with the energy scale .",
    "both lss and snia data exclude the highest values of @xmath1 , corresponding to models with an high effective @xmath176 . the combination of wmap3 and snls is particularly constraining for this class of models , and adding also 2df data has only minor effects on estimates .",
    "in fact , current sn data seem to prefer models with equation of state around or slightly lower than -1 , while for a quintessence model @xmath177 .",
    "sugra also favours higher values of @xmath178 , although differences are around 1/3 of the current uncertainty . as discussed above",
    ", @xmath1 affects estimates of @xmath14 and @xmath33 which in turn affect @xmath178 through the @xmath179 degeneracy .",
    "however , if additional data allow to establish a clear difference in estimates for sugra and @xmath0cdm , big bang nucleosynthesis measures could allow to distinguish the two models .",
    "let us also outline that sugra models show an improvement in the goodness of fit , when lss data are included in the analysis .",
    "such improvement is modest , @xmath180 , and does not provide a compelling evidence in favour of sugra cosmology .",
    "however , the dynamical range of sugra models is still very wide and compatible with the energy scales of fundamental physics , and at present they offer a valid alternative to @xmath0cdm .",
    "considering only wmap3 data , results for rp are qualitatively similar to sugra .",
    "upper limits on @xmath1 are moderately tighter than in sugra , @xmath181 ( 95% c.l . ) , and discrepancies between rp and @xmath0cdm estimates are greater that those between sugra and @xmath0cdm .",
    "however , adding other data strongly suppress the high tail of the distribution on @xmath1 ; using all data , we find @xmath182 ( 95% c.l . ) , well below the relevant range for ew and susy breaking .",
    "moreover , estimates for other parameters are very similar to @xmath0cdm values , except for @xmath183 and @xmath170 .",
    "both are lower than the corresponding @xmath0cdm figures by about 1 standard deviation .",
    "as already stated , previous works  @xcite used various combinations of data to constrain the slope of rp potential , finding that @xmath155 .",
    "a direct comparison of the marginalized distribution on @xmath25 and @xmath1 is not immediate ; however , we notice that assuming @xmath184 we find that @xmath185 when @xmath186 varies in the range @xmath187 and @xmath188km / s / mpc .",
    "for these values of the parameters , the range of initial conditions for which @xmath12 reaches the tracking regime is very small , and rp models have fine tuning problems similar to @xmath0cdm  @xcite . choosing initial conditions so that @xmath12 does not reach the tracking regime by the present time ,",
    "could alter the bounds on the potential parameters  @xcite .",
    "however , without tracking , quintessence models lose one of their conceptual advantages over other de candidates .",
    "thus rp models , while still compatible with present data , do not seem to be a strong alternative to a standard @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "we have used recent cosmological data to constrain the parameters of two relevant quintessence potentials , ratra ",
    "peebles ( rp ) and sugra .",
    "both potentials depend on an energy scale , @xmath1 , and the corresponding cosmologies reduce to @xmath0cdm for @xmath189 .    both for rp and sugra , current data allow to put only upper limits on @xmath1 , due to a strong degeneracy between @xmath156 and @xmath82 .",
    "when considering only the third  year wmap data , the degeneracy results in wider errors on several parameters , including @xmath82 , @xmath165 and @xmath170 .",
    "when lss and , especially , sn data are added to the analysis , constraints on @xmath1 strongly tighten .",
    "for rp potential , only values close to the cosmological limit are still allowed , and the model does not offer clear advantages to @xmath0cdm .    for sugra potential , instead , values of @xmath190 gev , close to weak interaction energy scale , are still compatible with data .",
    "in addition , estimates of several parameters are different from the corresponding @xmath0cdm values . in particular , the spectral index , @xmath33 ,",
    "is compatible with a zeldovich spectrum at less than 2 standard deviations .",
    "this could have a strong impact on constraints on the shape of the inflation potential .",
    "sugra models , thus , are still a viable and significant alternative to @xmath0cdm .",
