    "pure n=2 yang - mills theory has been analyzed , following the seminal work of seiberg and witten @xcite , for the groups @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "for each group , one finds a riemann surface @xmath0 , together with a preferred differential @xmath9 , such that the spectrum of bps - saturated states of electric and magnetic charges @xmath10 satisfies @xmath11 the moduli of the riemann surface are casimirs of the gauge group constructed out of the expectation value of the higgs field @xmath12 .",
    "its degenerations , and the monodromy of @xmath13 , @xmath14 yield a great deal of information , enabling one to reconstruct the effective gauge pre - potential , @xmath15 .",
    "the construction of the surface and preferred differential has been a somewhat _ ad hoc _ procedure , and one would like to find a uniform presentation for all gauge groups .",
    "we will outline such a construction , in which the differential , @xmath9 , and the proper period integrals can be obtained in a canonical and universal manner .",
    "the complete details will be postponed for another occasion .",
    "it was noticed independently by one of the present authors , and by gorsky  @xcite , that the @xmath6 curve appears as the spectral curve of an integrable system  the periodic toda lattice .",
    "the latter group went further , pointing out that the seiberg - witten differential appears naturally in the so - called _ whitham dynamics _ of adiabatic perturbations of integrable systems , and analyzing the  case in detail .",
    "we will show that , with a few twists , this framework of whitham dynamics for the toda lattice generates the effective pre - potential for all gauge groups .",
    "the theory of integrable systems has become a rich arena for the interplay of dynamical systems , ( loop ) group theory , and algebraic geometry .",
    "the existence of a complete set of integrals of the motion guarantees the existence of a canonical transformation to action - angle variables in which time development is straight - line motion on a torus . in the lax formulation",
    ", one realizes the flows generated by these integrals as = [ _ i , ]  , [ laxeqs ] with the dynamical variables appearing as parameters in the lax operator @xmath16 .",
    "integrability is a consequence of regarding as the condition for a flat gauge potential , so that @xmath16 , @xmath17 are elements of the lie algebra @xmath18 of a lie group @xmath2 .",
    "group theoretically , the phase space of the system is a coadjoint orbit of @xmath2 , typically reduced under the action of some subgroup ( frequently borel ) .",
    "particularly interesting cases arise when @xmath2 is a loop group ; then @xmath16 , @xmath17 are laurent polynomials in the loop variable @xmath19 .",

    "we will introduce the toda lattices for twisted kac - moody algebras in a moment .",
    "one might wonder how much of this data used in the linearization of the hamiltonian flows is invariantly specified . in particular , the construction of the spectral curve @xmath5 requires the choice of a representation @xmath4 that appears neither in the original hamiltonian equations of motion , nor in the coadjoint orbit description of the phase space .",
    "indeed , it is known @xcite that different choices of @xmath4 lead to different but equivalent descriptions of the dynamics , via an _ algebraic correspondence _ ( roughly , a one - to - many map in both directions ) between any given pair of choices .",
    "this fact will be important to us below , for instance one can use it to relate the curves for @xmath40 and @xmath41 yang - mills that have appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "one of the special things about the toda lattice is that its coadjoint orbit is of minimal dimension @xmath42 ; thus the constants of motion are in one - to - one correspondence with the casimirs of @xmath18 .",
    "the root system of @xmath18 respects a grading determined by the eigenvalue of the coxeter element of the weyl group of @xmath18 , or equivalently by the grading determined by the principal  subalgebra whose cartan subalgebra generator is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the weyl vector ( @xmath45 )",
    ". the equation will respect this grading ; giving weight one to @xmath26 and two to @xmath25 , the coefficient of @xmath46 in must be an invariant of the lie algebra of the appropriate grade , hence is a polynomial in the fundamental casimirs of @xmath18 .",
    "the powers of @xmath47 will occur at grade equal to twice the coxeter number @xmath48 , multiplied by the trivial invariant @xmath49 alluded to above ; in the yang - mills theory , this parameter sets the quantum scale .",
    "it is also useful to note that by conjugating @xmath50 , one can find a matrix @xmath51 that satisfies @xmath52 . from this",
    "it follows that is invariant under @xmath53 .",
    "the list of these curves for the classical groups with lax operators in the fundamental representation is : @xmath54 for @xmath6 and @xmath8 , the substitutions @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , convert these curves to the forms presented in @xcite for @xmath6 and @xcite for @xmath8 ; however , we will find that the natural toda variable @xmath22 is more convenient .",
    "we immediately see a problem if we are to relate the invariant curves of toda dynamics to those of n=2 yang - mills theory : the former have the affine root term @xmath57 appearing at a grade @xmath58 , whereas the latter have the instanton - generated term @xmath57 appearing at a grade @xmath59 .",

    "for the toda curves of the nonsimply - laced groups @xmath7 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the two differ : @xmath65 .",
    "fortunately , for each nonsimply - laced affine dynkin diagram , there is a dual diagram with long roots @xmath66 short roots , and @xmath67 ; these are listed in table 2 .",
    "the ade algebras are self - dual under this transformation .",
    "these affine algebras may be obtained as the orbifold of an untwisted kac - moody algebra by the obvious symmetry of its ordinary dynkin diagram ; thus @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , where the superscript @xmath72 denotes the order of the diagram automorphism .",

    "one readily finds the form obtained in @xcite .    to summarize , to the montonen - olive dual of each simple lie algebra @xmath18 , we may associate a family of toda curves @xmath5 whose moduli are the casimirs of @xmath18 , and which respect the discrete @xmath24-symmetry of n=2 yang - mills",
    ". we will now show how one may pick out a preferred rank(@xmath18)-dimensional subspace of the jacobian of @xmath5 on which the flow linearizes , and the correspondence between them for different @xmath4 .",
    "the associated cycles on @xmath5 will be the special ones needed for the seiberg - witten construction .",
    "to find the spectrum of bps - saturated states one must compute @xmath25 , @xmath81 from the periods of a seiberg - witten differential @xmath1 on the riemann surface @xmath5 .",
    "the problem is that for all but the fundamental representation of @xmath6 , the genus of @xmath5 is much larger than rank(@xmath18 ) .",
    "thus , apart from finding @xmath1 , one also needs to determine rank(@xmath18 ) preferred @xmath82- and @xmath83-cycles .",
    "this issue has already been encountered in the study of orthogonal groups , where the preferred cycles can be isolated using the involution @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "this method generalizes neither to higher representations nor to the exceptional groups .",
    "however , the general solution to this problem can be obtained using toda theories .",
    "the key is to realize that the coadjoint orbit , and not so much the surface or its jacobian , that contains the essential physics .",
    "it is easy to see why this must be so in the toda context : there are only @xmath85 dynamical variables , and since the equations linearize on the jacobian , the hamiltonian flows select a complex rank(@xmath18 ) dimensional sub - variety of the jacobian of any given surface .",
    "this sub - variety turns out to be a prym variety , is universal , and in particular is independent of the representation , @xmath4 . we believe that this jacobian sub - variety is the one that solves the seiberg - witten problem . the purpose in this section is to give a far more usable characterization of this special prym variety .    for @xmath86",
    ", the fundamental representation happens to give a curve of genus equal to rank(@xmath18 ) , and thus characterizes the special prym : it is the complete jacobian of this curve .",
    "one can then find how this jacobian sits inside the jacobian of other curves by setting up a _",
    "correspondence_. given two algebraic curves , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , defined by : f(x , z )  =  0 f(x^,z^ )  =  0  , [ corresp ] a correspondence between these curves is a multivalued holomorphic map given by ( one or more ) polynomial equations of the form @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "a correspondence can be used to map homology cycles and holomorphic differentials from one curve to another , and in particular maps the special prym of @xmath87 to the special prym of @xmath88  therefore the fundamental representation of @xmath86 generates the special prym in any representation .",
    "this is discussed extensively in @xcite , where the example of @xmath40 in the @xmath91 and in the @xmath92 is discussed in detail . indeed , suppose that @xmath93 defines the curve for the fundamental of @xmath86 , and @xmath94 defines the curve for the two index anti - symmetric tensor of @xmath86 .",
    "then a correspondence between these curves is given by z  =   z^ f(x - x^,z )  =  0  .",
    "for @xmath95 this correspondence maps the jacobian of the fundamental curve of genus @xmath96 , to a three dimensional sub - variety of the the jacobian of the genus @xmath97 curve derived using the @xmath92 of @xmath40 .",
    "one can check that the corresponding cycles are precisely those identified in @xcite as the solution of the seiberg - witten problem for @xmath41 , and that @xmath1 for one curve maps to @xmath1 for the other .",
    "this method of correspondences is subsumed in a more general group theoretic procedure .",
    "the first step is to view the riemann surface ( [ curve ] ) as a foliation over the riemann sphere for @xmath22 , and extend @xmath98 to an analytic function of @xmath22 .",
    "the number of leaves is then equal to the dimension of the representation @xmath4 .",
    "leaves are connected when @xmath22 takes a value at which two of the eigenvalues of @xmath99 become the same . since the determinant ( [ curve ] ) is invariant under @xmath100 , such values of @xmath22 occur in pairs related by @xmath53 . at a generic higgs vev @xmath101 , and for finite @xmath98 , the eigenvalues come together in pairs , and the result is a square - root branch cut running between the two values of @xmath22 at which this happens .",
    "it is now convenient to consider the element @xmath102 of the cartan sub - algebra of @xmath18 that is conjugate to @xmath99 . by using the action of the weyl group",
    ", we will take @xmath102 to be in the fundamental weyl chamber .",
    "if @xmath103 are the weights of the representation @xmath4 , then the eigenvalues of @xmath99 , and hence the leaves of the foliation , are given by @xmath104 , @xmath105 . since",
    "casimir invariants are equivalent to weyl invariant polynomials in the weights , it follows that in general ( [ curve ] ) will decompose into disconnected component riemann surfaces associated with the weyl orbits of the weights of @xmath4 .",
    "so we will focus on one of these components .",
    "the sheets of the foliation will generically come together when @xmath102 ceases to be a regular element of the lie algebra , that is , when it hits a wall of the fundamental weyl chamber . at generic higgs vevs in the fundamental weyl chamber",
    ", this happens when @xmath106 , for some simple root @xmath107 .",
    "there can be also be `` accidental '' singularities where two eigenvalues come together , and yet @xmath102 is regular . whether this happens or not depends upon the details of the specific example , and even if it happens , there is a method of constructing a cover of the riemann surface with accidental singularities such that the cover only has branch points when @xmath102 ceases to be regular @xcite .",
    "we will therefore ignore accidental singularities , apart from a brief comment later on .",
    "there are thus rank(@xmath18 ) branch cuts over the @xmath22-plane , each associated with a simple root of @xmath18 . above the cut corresponding to @xmath108 ,",
    "leaves labelled by @xmath103 and @xmath109 will be joined together along the cut if and only if the weyl reflection generated by @xmath108 exchanges the the weights @xmath103 and @xmath109 .",
    "this characterizes the foliation at finite values of @xmath98 .",
    "there is another cut that runs from @xmath110 to @xmath111 which determines the structure at @xmath112 . taking the limit as @xmath113 in ( [ curve ] ) , and keeping the dominant terms",
    ", one finds that the result has the coxeter symmetry of the dual affine lie algebra , and that the leaves in the foliation are connected under the action of this symmetry .",
    "the whole point of this construction is that the resulting surface has a symmetry action of the weyl group acting upon it .",
    "this can be used to induce a symmetry on the cycles , upon the holomorphic differentials and hence upon the jacobian variety . however , even though the leaves in the foliation are a weyl orbit , the weyl representation can be ( and in fact is ) reducible ; moreover , it generically contains the fundamental rank(@xmath18 ) dimensional reflection representation .",
    "the preferred prym is obtained by passing to the part of the jacobian variety that corresponds to the reflection representation of the weyl group . in a moment",
    "we will give an example , but we first wish to make the foregoing statement more precise by quoting the results of @xcite .",
    "consider a principal @xmath2-bundle @xmath114 over an algebraic variety @xmath115 , together with a section @xmath12 of the adjoint bundle @xmath116 ( , a higgs vev ) can be _ any _ algebraic variety , leading to the notion of an _ algebraically completely integrable _ hamiltonian system .",
    "] . given this data",
    ", one can construct @xcite a kind of ` universal spectral cover ' @xmath117 with galois group @xmath118 , the weyl group of @xmath2 .",
    "the points of @xmath117 over @xmath119 can typically be identified with chambers of the dual of the unique cartan subalgebra @xmath120 containing @xmath121 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath2 is @xmath86 considered as a matrix in the fundamental representation , a point of the fiber is an ordering of the eigenvalues of @xmath121 .",
    "the universal cover @xmath117 is independent of a choice of representation .    given a representation @xmath122 , with highest weight @xmath123 , we can construct a surface @xmath124 as outlined above ; or we can construct a quotient space @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the parabolic subgroup that fixes @xmath127 . if there are no accidental singularities then @xmath124 is isomorphic to @xmath128 , otherwise @xmath124 is birational to @xmath128 , with @xmath128 covering @xmath124 .",

    "counting the branch points , a simple application of riemann - hurwitz shows that the surface has genus 11 .    following the discussion above ,",
    "it is more natural to think of the surface as a ten - sheeted cover over the @xmath22-plane , with four branch cuts of order @xmath145 ( _ i.e. _ square root cuts ) at finite @xmath98 , and one branch cut of order @xmath146 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath147 ) between @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "label the weights of the @xmath148 , and hence the leaves in the foliation , by vectors of the form @xmath149 ( see figure 1 . ) .",
    "the coxeter element , @xmath150 , is the cyclic permutation of order @xmath97 , and collects the weights of the @xmath148 into two groups of @xmath97 .",
    "this specifies the connections between the foliations at the cut between @xmath110 and @xmath111 . for each simple root @xmath108 , @xmath151",
    ", there are exactly three pairs of weights that are interchanged by the weyl reflection @xmath152 , and corresponding leaves are connected in pairs , leading to @xmath153 pieces of interconnecting plumbing .",
    "if one takes into account the connections from the cut @xmath110 and @xmath111 , the ten sheets connect into two disjoint two spheres , and the remaining @xmath153 connections , associated with the simple roots , convert this into a genus @xmath154 surface . the fact that we get the same answer  viewing the surface as a foliation over the @xmath22-plane , and as a branched cover of the @xmath98-plane using  indicates that there are no accidental singularities .",
    "the resulting picture is shown in figure 1 .",
    "it is relatively easy to find the reflection representation of the weyl group of @xmath140 inside the ten - dimensional representation of @xmath140 : one defines @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the basis vector of the @xmath148 with weight @xmath123 . under the action of the weyl group on the @xmath156 , the vectors @xmath157",

    "however , if one is interested in global questions such as integrated correlations of order parameters , there exists an elegant solution in the form of @xmath191-functions , the kp hierarchy , and topological field theory@xcite .",
    "the connection between this construction and the field - theoretic formulation is quite indirect .",
    "answers to ` local ' ( nevertheless gauge invariant ) questions , such as the ising correlation function at fixed geodesic distance or the partition function at fixed surface moduli , are harder to come by ; they are not encompassed by the integrable - topological formalism and the only tool at present is to resort to the field theoretic description .",
    "on the other hand , this zero - momentum sector contains a great deal of information about the phase structure of the theory .",
    "a great deal is known about the singularities of toda dynamics @xcite which might be adapted to the study of degenerations in n=2 yang - mills @xcite .",
    "one may contemplate a much broader applicability of the above ideas .",
    "curves and seiberg - witten differentials for  theory with fundamental and adjoint matter@xcite , and for @xmath86 with fundamental matter@xcite , have been proposed .",
    "they have natural forms when expressed in toda - style variables . due to the discrete @xmath24-symmetry , the effect on the spectral curve of adding matter is to reduce the degree of the @xmath57 term from @xmath192 to @xmath193 $ ] , with the deficit in homogeneity weight made up in these examples by a polynomial @xmath194 of degree @xmath195 .",
    "the obvious modification of the toda lax operator to try is to lower the grade of the highest weight element @xmath196 .",
    "this will simultaneously increase the size of the coadjoint orbit , so that the moduli of the curve may include the @xmath75 .",
    "the appearance of kac - moody algebras in the solution of n=2 gauge theories is a profound mystery .",
    "the fact that the dual @xmath3 of the gauge group @xmath2 appears suggests a connection to monopole dynamics .",
    "the appearance of the spectral parameter ( loop coordinate ) @xmath22 begs a physical explanation .",
    "this sort of structure has been encountered in @xmath197 supersymmetric models in two dimensions , where the dependence of certain two - point functions upon couplings and scales , and even two - dimensional instanton corrections , is determined by some classical integrable equations ( the @xmath198 equations ) @xcite . following similar lines of thought ,",
    "one is naturally led to consider the four - dimensional version of the chiral ring , and its action on the bundle of yang - mills vacua over the base of higgs vevs .",
    "one finds many close parallels , and some significant differences , between the two and four - dimensional structures , and this approach is still under investigation .",
    "the fact that there is a duality between two and four dimensional instanton corrections in string theory @xcite strongly suggests that there should indeed be a four dimensional version of @xmath199 .",
    "the appearance of affine lie algebras also suggests that the level - rank dualities of wzw models @xcite might ` explain ' n=1 yang - mills dualities . in topological field theories closely related to ours @xcite , a useful set of coordinates localizes the dynamics on the critical points ( branch points ) of the curve ; this may be the convenient way to describe soft breaking to n=1 @xcite .",
    "the soft breaking terms could be added to the whitham dynamics as a secular perturbation of the flow equations @xcite .",
    "one might also imagine extending the scope of our construction to string theory .",
    "kachru  @xcite have found the spectral curve of rigid n=2 yang - mills theory as a limit in the calabi - yau moduli space of some examples , but not others .",
    "the role of the periods of the seiberg - witten differential is played by periods of a three - form on the calabi - yau .",
    "this is not inconsistent with our results ; the invariant specification of toda as coadjoint orbit dynamics on a loop group makes no reference to riemann surfaces .",
    "notice also that the notions of spectral cover and analytically completely integrable hamiltonian system are quite general , and not at all restricted to @xmath115 being a riemann surface ; it is not out of the question that one could construct an integrable system based on calabi - yau manifolds that ` explains ' the results of kachru @xcite , and that includes the effects of coupling to supergravity .",
    "donagi and markman @xcite have built an integrable system canonically associated to any calabi - yau threefold , and conjecture that it is related to mirror symmetry ( and , one might expect , all of t - duality ) .",
    "this calabi - yau integrable system bears many similarities to its riemann surface counterpart employed above .",
    "indeed , could there not be a grand integrable system that governs all the miraculous stringy dualities that have emerged ?",
