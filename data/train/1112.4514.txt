    "systems with multiple exoplanets , and transiting exoplanets , each bolster confidence in the reality of the planetary interpretation of the signals and offer distinct constraints on models of planet formation .",
    "the first extrasolar planets were found around a pulsar @xcite , and it was the multi - planetary nature  in particular the gravitational perturbations between the planets @xcite  which solidified this outlandish claim . around sun - like stars as well , the origin of radial velocity signals continued to be questioned by some , at the time multiple planets were found around ups andromeda @xcite . the orbital configuration of planets relative to each other has shed light on a host of physical processes , from smooth radial migration into resonant orbits @xcite to chaotic scattering into secular eccentricity cycles @xcite . now with ever - growing statistics of ever - smaller doppler - detected planets in multiple systems @xcite , the formation and early history of planetary systems continues to come into sharper focus .    concurrently ,",
    "transiting exoplanets have paid burgeoning dividends , starting with the definitive proof that doppler signals were truly due to gas - giant planets orbiting in close - in orbits @xcite .",
    "transit lightcurves offer precise geometrical constraints on the orbit of the planet @xcite , such that radial velocity and photometric measurements yield the density of the planet and hence point to its composition @xcite .",
    "transiting configurations also enable follow - up measurements @xcite which inform on the mechanisms of planetary formation , evolution , and even weather .",
    "these two research streams , multiplanets and transiting planets , came together for the first time with the discovery of kepler-9 @xcite .",
    "this discovery was enabled by data from the _ kepler _  mission @xcite , which is uniquely suited for such detections as it offers near - continuous high - precision photometric monitoring of target stars .",
    "based on the first 4 months of _ kepler _  data , @xcite announced the detection of 170 stars each with 2 or more candidate transiting planets ; @xcite discussed in detail 5 systems each possessing multiple candidate transiting planets .",
    "a comparative analysis of the population of candidates with multiple planets and single planets was published by @xcite , and @xcite discussed the architecture and dynamics of the ensemble of candidate multi - planet systems .",
    "the path to confirming the planetary nature of such _ kepler _  candidates is arduous . at present , three stars ( in addition to kepler-9 ) hosting multiple transiting candidates have been presented in detail and the planetary nature of each of the candidates has been established : these systems are kepler-10 @xcite , kepler-11 @xcite , and kepler-18 @xcite .",
    "transiting planets are most profitable when their masses can be determined directly from observation , either through radial velocity ( rv ) monitoring of the host star or by transit timing variations ( ttvs ) , as was done for kepler-9bc , kepler-10b , kepler-11bcdef , and kepler-18bcd .",
    "when neither the rv or ttv signals is detected , statistical arguments can be employed to show that the planetary hypothesis is far more likely than alternate scenarios ( namely blends of several stars containing an eclipsing component ) , and this was the means by which kepler-9d , kepler-10c , and kepler-11 g were all validated . while such work proves the existence of a planet and determines its radius , the mass and hence composition remain unknown save for speculation from theoretical considerations .",
    "this paper presents the discovery of a new system , kepler-20 , with five candidate transiting planets .",
    "we validate three of these by statistical argument ; we then proceed to use rv measurements to determine the masses of two of these , and we place an upper limit on the mass of the third .",
    "we do not validate in this paper the remaining two signals ( and hence remain only candidates , albeit very interesting ones , owing to their diminutive sizes ) , rather the validation of these two remaining signals is addressed in a separate effort @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in  2 , we present our extraction of the _ kepler _  light curve (  2.1 ) , our modeling of these data ( and rvs ) to estimate the orbital and physical parameters of the planets and star (  2.2 ) , as well as limits on the motion of the photocentroid during transit (  2.3 ) and a study of the long - term astrophysical variability of the star from the _ kepler _  light curve (  2.4 ) . in ",
    "3 we present follow - up observations that we use to argue for the planetary interpretation , including high - resolution imaging (  3.1 ) and _ spitzer _  photometry (  3.2 ) , and the spectroscopy we use to characterize the star and determine the radial velocity signal (  3.3 ) . in  4 , we present our statistical analysis that validates the planetary nature of the three largest candidate planets in the system . in ",
    "5 we consider the dynamics of the system , and in  6 we discuss the constraints on the composition and formation history of the three planets .      throughout the course of the _ kepler _  mission ,",
    "a given star is known by many different names ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an explanation of _ kepler _  naming conventions ) , and we pause here to explain the relationship of these names in the current context .",
    "the star that is the subject of this paper is located at @xmath19@xmath20 , @xmath21@xmath22  ( j2000 ) .",
    "it was already known as 2massj19104752 + 4220194 , and in the _ kepler _  input catalog it was designated kic  6850504 . after the identification of candidate transiting planets it became a _ kepler",
    "_  object of interest ( koi ) and was further dubbed k00070 , and it appeared as such in the list of candidates published by @xcite .",
    "some authors have elected to denote kois using a different nomenclature , in which case k00070  would be identified as koi-70 . after the confirmation of the planetary nature of three of these candidates it was given its final moniker kepler-20 .",
    "this paper describes that process of confirmation , but for simplicity we refer to the star as kepler-20  throughout .",
    "the three confirmed exoplanets were initially assigned koi designations representing the chronological order in which the transiting signals were identified , but to avoid confusion we will refer to them henceforth by their kepler-20  designations in which they are ordered by increasing orbital period @xmath23 ; kepler-20b  ( k00070.02 , @xmath24  d ) , kepler-20c  ( k00070.01 , @xmath25  d ) , and kepler-20d  ( k00070.03 , @xmath26  d ) .",
    "we will refer to the two remaining candidates as k00070.04  and k00070.05 , but note ( as described below ) that the period of k00070.04  ( @xmath27  d ) is intermediate between those of kepler-20b  and kepler-20c , and the period of k00070.05  ( @xmath28  d ) is intermediate between those of kepler-20c  and kepler-20d .",

    "observations of kepler-20  commenced ut 2009 may 13 with quarter 1 ( q1 ) , and the _ kepler _  data that we describe here extend through ut 2011 march 14 corresponding to the end of quarter 8 ( q8 ) , resulting in near - continuous monitoring over a span of 22.4  months .",
    "the _ kepler _  bandpass spans @xmath29 to @xmath30  nm for which the response is greater than 5% @xcite .",
    "this wavelength domain is roughly equivalent to the @xmath31-band @xcite .",
    "these observations have been reduced and calibrated by the _ kepler _",
    "pipeline @xcite .",
    "the _ kepler _  pipeline produces calibrated light curves referred to as simple aperture photometry ( sap ) data in the _ kepler _  archive , and this is the data product we used as the initial input for our analysis to determine the system parameters ( see below ) .",
    "the pipeline provides time series with times in barycentric julian days ( bjd ) , and flux in photo - electrons per observation .",
    "the data were initially gathered at long cadence @xcite consisting of an integration time per data point of 29.426  minutes . after the identification of candidate transiting planets in the data from q1 , the target",
    "was also observed at short cadence @xcite corresponding to an integration time of 1  minute for q2@xmath32q6 .",
    "we elected to use the long cadence version of the entire q1@xmath32q8 time series for computational efficiency .",

    "the data are available electronically from the multi mission archive at the space telescope science institute ( mast ) web site .",
    "the star is positioned on one of four different detectors , depending upon the particular quarter , which results in the most obvious offsets that occur roughly 4 times per year .",

    "we first cleaned the q1@xmath32q8 long - cadence _ kepler _  sap photometry of kepler-20  of instrumental and long - term astrophysical variability not related to the planetary transits by fitting and removing a second - order polynomial to each contiguous photometric segment .",
    "we defined a segment to be a series of long - cadence observations that does not have a gap larger than five measurements ( spanning at least 2.5 hours ) . in this process",

    "our approach implicitly assumes that all 5 transit signals are due to planets orbiting kepler-20 ; the validation of the 3 largest planets , kepler-20b , kepler-20c , and kepler-20d , is presented in  4 . using the validation approach presented in  4 ,",

    "[ sec : blender ] we use the blender method to demonstrate that this possibility is extremely unlikely for kepler-20b , kepler-20c , and kepler-20d , and it is this blender work that is the basis for our claim that each of these three objects are planets .",

    "both techniques are similarly accurate , but in practice the flux weighted centroid technique is more sensitive to noise for low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) transits .",
    "we use both techniques because they are both subject to biases due to various systematics , but respond to those systematics in different ways .    in our difference image analysis @xcite",
    ", we evaluate the difference between average in - transit pixel images and average out - of - transit images . in the absence of pixel - level systematics , the pixels with the highest flux in the difference image will form a star image at the location of the transiting object , with amplitude equal to the depth of the transit .",

    "the product of the area implied by @xmath235 and the densities in the previous column are listed in column  5 , in units of @xmath237 .",
    "column  6 is the result of multiplying this number of stars by the frequency of suitable ebs ( @xmath238% ; see * ? ? ?",

    "we count 100 candidates that are within @xmath186 of the measured radius ratio of kepler-20d , implying an _ a priori _ transiting planet frequency of @xmath242 .",
    "the likelihood of a planet is therefore several orders of magnitude larger than the likelihood of a false positive ( @xmath243 ) , and we consider kepler-20d  to be validated as a planet with a high degree of confidence .",
    "the transit signals from kepler-20b  and kepler-20c  are better defined , and as a result blender  is able to rule out all scenarios involving background ebs consisting of two stars , as well as all physically associated triples .",

    "we count 52 cases in that list within @xmath186 of the measured radius ratio of kepler-20b , leading to an _ a priori _ planet frequency of @xmath244 .",
    "this is nearly 20,000 times larger than the blend frequency given in table  [ tab : blendfreq_70.02 ] ( @xmath245 ) . for kepler-20c  the planet prior based on the measured radius ratio is @xmath246 , which is approximately @xmath247 times larger than the likelihood of a blend",
    "therefore , both kepler-20b  and kepler-20c  are validated as planets with a very high degree of confidence .",
    "we carried out similar calculations for the candidates k00070.04  and k00070.05 .",
    "the transit signals of these two candidates are much more shallow than those of kepler-20b , kepler-20c , and kepler-20d . as a result ,",
    "the constraint on the shape of the transit is considerably weaker than in the cases described above , and many more false positives than before are found with blender  that provide acceptable fits within @xmath186 of the quality of a planet model .",
    "additionally , neither of these candidates were observed with _",
    ", so the constraint on the near - infrared depth of the transit that allowed us to rule out some of the blends for kepler-20d  is not available here . in particular , physically associated stars transited by a larger planet can not all be ruled out , and this ends up contributing significantly to the overall blend frequency .",
    "we conclude that the blender  methodology as implemented above is insufficient to validate either k00070.04  or k00070.05 , and we defer this issue to a subsequent study @xcite .",

    "in this section we discuss the transit times and long - term stability of the system of planets orbiting kepler-20 .",
    "both are consistent with the planet interpretation for all 5 candidates : transit timing variations ( ttvs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not seen or expected , and the system is expected to be stable over long timescales .",
    "the individual transit times are measured by allowing a template transit light curve to slide in time to fit the data for each transit @xcite .",
    "the resulting transit times are given in table [ tab : ttv ] . aside from slightly more scatter than expected from the formal error bars there is no indication of perturbations such as coherent patterns .",
    "such excess scatter is not atypical of transit times measured by the standard pipeline @xcite .",
    "thus , we find no evidence for dynamical interactions among either the transiting planets or additional , non - transiting planets .    to calculate predicted transit times , we numerically integrate our baseline model , which consists of a central star of mass 0.912  @xmath252 surrounded by planets with periods and epochs given in table  [ tab : p - params ] ( given at dynamical epoch bjd 2454170 ) , and with masses of 8.7 , 0.65 , 16.1 , 1.1 and 8.0 @xmath253 ( from least to greatest orbital period ) , corresponding to the best - fit masses for kepler-20b  and kepler-20c , a guess of @xmath254 @xcite for kepler-20d , and masses giving earth s density for k00070.04  and k00070.05 .",
    "( we remind the reader that we have not , in this paper , validated these two candidates as planets . however , considering them as such for the purposes of evaluating dynamical stability is the conservative choice , since the presence of 5 planets , as opposed to 3 , is more likely to induce dynamical instabilities .",
    "@xcite presents the validation of k00070.04  and k00070.05 , gives their sizes , from which the masses above are derived , and discusses constraints on their masses . )",
    "the orbits are chosen to be initially circular , coplanar , and edge - on to the line of sight .",
    "the root mean square deviations of the model transit times from the best - fit linear ephemeris projected over 8 years are approximately 3s , 76s , 9s , 95s and 10s ( from least to greatest orbital period ) , all significantly smaller than the measurement precision shown in figure  [ fig : tts ] .",
    "next , we investigated long - term stability for this system by integrating the baseline model with the hybrid algorithm in mercury @xcite .",
    "as no close encounters were recorded , this algorithm reduced to the symplectic algorithm @xcite , with time steps of 0.1  days , roughly 2.7% of the period of the innermost planet . over the 10  myr integration duration",
    ", there were no indications of instability .",
    "the orbital eccentricities fluctuated on the scale between approximately @xmath255 ( for kepler-20d ) and @xmath256 ( for k00070.04 ) .",
    "we conclude that plausible , low - eccentricity models for the system are stable over long timescales .",
    "finally , we performed an ensemble of n - body integrations using the time - symmetric 4th order hermite integrator @xcite implemented in swarm - ngeford / code / swarm/ ] to estimate the maximum plausible eccentricity for each planet consistent with long - term stability .",
    "for each n - body integration , we set four planets on circular orbits and assigned one planet a non - zero eccentricity .",
    "the eccentricity and pericenter directions for the planet on a non - circular orbit were drawn from uniform distributions .",
    "the maximum for the uniform distribution of eccentricities was chosen to be slightly larger than necessary for its orbit to cross one of its neighbors .",
    "we report @xmath257 , the maximum initial eccentricity that resulted in a system with no close encounters ( within one mutual hill radius ) and semi - major axes ( in a jacobi frame ) which varied by less than 1% for the duration of the integrations . based on 100 integrations per planet and relatively short integrations ( @xmath247 years )",
    ", we estimate @xmath257 to be 0.19 , 0.16 , 0.16 , 0.38 and 0.55 ( from smallest to largest orbital period ) .",
    "technically , we can not completely exclude larger eccentricities , due to various assumptions ( such as the planet masses , coplanarity , prograde orbits , absence of false positives , and the potential for small islands of stability at higher eccentricity ) .",
    "nevertheless , the n - body integrations support the assumption of non - crossing orbits , as the vast majority of systems with an eccentricity larger than @xmath257 are dynamical unstable .",

    "we employ planet interior structure models @xcite to explore the range of plausible planet compositions .",
    "the interpretation is challenging because we do not yet know if these sub - neptune planets had a stunted formation , or if they formed as gas giants and then lost significant mass to evaporation @xcite .",
    "this is partly owing to the uncertainties involved in atmospheric escape modeling .",
    "notably , both kepler-20c  and kepler-20d  require significant volatile contents to account for their low mean densities , and can not be composed of rocky and iron material alone .",
    "the volatile material in these planets could take the form of ices ( h@xmath259o , ch@xmath260 , nh@xmath261 ) and/or h / he gas accreted during planet formation .",
    "outgassing of rocky planets releases an insufficient quantity of volatiles ( no more than 23% h@xmath259o and 3.6% h@xmath259 relative to the planet mass ) to account for kepler-20c  and could account for kepler-20d  only in fine - tuned near - optimal outgassing scenarios @xcite . for kepler-20c , ices ( likely dominated by h@xmath259o ) would need to constitute the majority of its mass , in the absence of a voluminous , though low - mass , envelope of light gases .",
    "alternatively , a composition with approximately 1% by mass h / he surrounding an earth - composition refractory interior also matches the observed properties of the planet within @xmath207 .",
    "intermediate scenarios , wherein both h / he and higher mean molecular weight volatile species from ices contribute to the planet mass , are also possible . for kepler-20d , the @xmath262 upper limit on the planet density demands at least a few percent h@xmath259o by mass , or a few tenths of a percent h / he by mass .",
    "the nature of kepler-20b s composition is ambiguous : kepler-20b   could be terrestrial ( with the transit radius defined by a rocky surface ) , or it could support a significant gas envelope ( like kepler-20c  and kepler-20d ) . in the mass - radius diagram ( figure  [ fig : rogersmr ] ) ,",
    "the measured properties of kepler-20b  straddle the pure - silicate composition curve that defines a strict upper bound to rocky planet radii .",
    "if kepler-20b  is in fact a terrestrial planet consisting of an iron core surrounded by a silicate mantle , the @xmath207 limits on the planet mass and radius constrain the iron core to be less than 62% of the planet mass .",
    "in particular , an earth - like composition ( 30% iron core , 70% silicate mantle ) is possible and matches the observational constraints to within 1  @xmath230 , but a mercury - like composition ( 70% iron core , 30% silicate mantle ) is not acceptable .",
    "alternatively , kepler-20b  may harbor a substantial gas layer like its sibling planets kepler-20c  and kepler-20d  at larger orbital semi - major axes , and/or contain a significant component of astrophysical ices such as h@xmath263o .",
    "the @xmath207 lower limits on the planet density constrain the fraction of kepler-20b s mass that can be contributed by h@xmath259o ( @xmath264 ) and h / he ( @xmath265 ) .    given their high levels of stellar irradiation ( the semi - major axes of all five kepler-20  planets are smaller than that of mercury ) , atmospheric escape likely played an important role sculpting the compositions of the kepler-20  planets .",
    "planet compositions with low mean molecular weight gas envelopes would be especially susceptible to mass loss . using a model for energy",
    "limited escape from hydrogen - rich envelopes @xcite , we estimate that kepler-20b  would be losing on the order of @xmath266 , which corresponds to 0.02  @xmath267 .",
    "following the same approach , the estimated hydrogen mass loss rates for kepler-20c  and kepler-20d  are @xmath268 ( @xmath269 ) and @xmath270 ( @xmath271 ) , respectively .",
    "our theoretical understanding of atmospheric escape from highly irradiated super - earth and sub - neptune exoplanets is very uncertain , and higher mass loss rates are plausible ( especially at earlier times when the host star was more active ) .",
    "it is intriguing that kepler-20b , with its shorter orbital period and greater vulnerability to mass loss , also has a higher mean density than kepler-20c  and kepler-20d .",
    "more detailed modeling may constrain kepler-20b s compositional history and the extent to which its relative paucity of volatiles can be attributed to evaporation .",
    "the kepler-20  planetary system shares several remarkable attributes with kepler-11 @xcite , namely the presence of multiple transiting low - density low - mass planets in a closely spaced orbital architecture .",
    "the kepler-20  system is less extreme than kepler-11 in the realms of both low planet densities ( figure  [ fig : rogersmr ] ) and dynamical compactness ( the kepler-11 planets exhibit ttvs while the kepler-20  planets do not ) .",
    "a striking feature of the kepler-20  planetary system is the presence of earth - size rocky planet candidates interspersed between volatile - rich sub - neptunes at smaller and larger orbital semi - major axes , as also seen in _ kepler _",
