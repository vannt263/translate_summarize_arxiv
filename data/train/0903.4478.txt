    "our interest here is heterogeneous pool of names , where the names can have different statistics ( under the risk - neutral probability measure ) .",
    "there are several perspectives from which to view this effort .",
    "one is that we seek some sort of _ homogenization _ or _ data fusion_. is there an effective macroscopic description of the behavior of the cdo when the underlying instruments are a large number of different types of bonds ? another is an investigation into the _ fine detail _ of the rare events which cause loss in the investment - grade tranches .",
    "there may be many ways or `` configurations '' for the investment - grade tranches to suffer losses .",
    "which one is most likely to happen ?",
    "this is not only of academic interest ; it also is intimately tied to quantities like loss given default and also to numerical simulations .",
    "we believe this to be an important component of a larger analysis of cdo s , particularly in cases where correlation comes from only a few sources ( we will pursue a simple form of this idea in subsection [ s : correlated ] ) .",
    "we will find a natural generalization of the result of @xcite , where the dominant term ( as the number of names becomes large ) was a relative entropy . here",

    "each name is affected by its own _ idiosyncratic _",
    "randomness and by _ systemic _ randomness ( which affects all of the names ) .",
    "assumedly , the systemic randomness , which corresponds to macroeconomic factors , is _ low - dimensional _ compared to the number of names .",
    "for example , there may be only a handful of macroeconomic factors which a pool of many thousands of names .",
    "we can capture this functionality as @xmath29 where the @xmath30 and @xmath31 are all independent random variables , and @xmath32 is some appropriate set in the product space of the sets where the @xmath33 s and @xmath31 take values .",
    "our interest is to understand the implications of the structural model .",
    "we are not so much concerned with specific models for the @xmath33 s , the @xmath31 , or the @xmath32 s but rather the structure of the rare losses in the investment - grade tranches .",
    "we would also like to avoid , as much as possible , a detailed analysis of the parts of since in practice what we have available to carry out pricing calculations is the price of credit default swaps for the individual names ; i.e. ( after a transformation ) , @xmath34 .",

    "hopefully , when we reinsert the systemic randomness , the variance of @xmath47 will still be small , and we will indeed have an investment - grade tranche .",

    "namely , @xmath50 this then clearly motivates a natural two - step approach .",
    "our first step is to condition on the value of the systemic randomness ( which we may think of as fixing a `` state of the world '' or a `` regime '' ) and concentrate on how rare events occur due to idiosyncratic randomness ( i.e. , to effectively _ suppress _ the systemic randomness ) .",
    "it will turn out that this is in itself a fairly involved calculation .",
    "nevertheless , it is connected with a classic problem in large deviations theory_sanov",
    "s theorem_. with this in hand , we should then be able to return to the original problem and average over the systemic randomness ( in subsection [ s : correlated ] ) .",
    "some of the finer details of these effects of correlation will appear in sequels to this paper . here",
    "we will restrict our interest in the effects of correlation to a very simple model ( which is hopefully nevertheless illustrative ) .",

    "assume that for each @xmath12 , every third i.e. , @xmath61 name follows distribution @xmath58 and the others follow distribution @xmath59 ; i.e. , @xmath62 for all @xmath51 .",
    "to be even more specific , one might let @xmath63 correspond to a bond with moody s a3 rating , and one might let @xmath64 correspond to a bond with moody s ba1 rating see @xcite .",
    "although we could separately carry out the analysis of @xcite for the @xmath65 bonds and the @xmath66 bonds , we shall find that the combined cdo reflects a nontrivial combination of the calculations for each separate bond .",

    "since the @xmath4 s are independent , @xmath43 is a sum of @xmath12 independent ( but not identically - distributed ) bernoulli random variables .",
    "the central idea of collateralized debt obligations ( and structured finance in general ) is that by pooling together a large number of assets , one can use the law of large numbers to reduce variance and create derivatives which depend on tail events .",
    "our assumption that the names are independent means that in some sense we have `` maximal '' randomness ; the dimension of idiosyncratic randomness is the same as the dimension of the number of names .",
    "good bounds on tail behavior should thus result .",

    "if the names are correlated , there is in a sense `` less '' randomness , so the variance should be larger . between our work here and that of @xcite , we have a number of tools which we can use when the degree of randomness is indeed comparable to the number of names in the cdo .",

    "namely , the grtner - ellis theorem of large deviations tells us that the first step in studying rare events is to take the legendre - fenchel transform of a limiting logarithmic moment - generating function .",
    "the background object of interest is the empirical measure , and the appropriate legendre - fenchel transform is given in .",

    "assumedly , they should lead to the intuitively - appealing rate function and agree with the fairly straightforward calculations of example [ ex : twobonds ] , both of which encapsulate the idea that there are many configurations leading to a loss , but we want the one which is least unlikely .",
    "aside of intellectual curiosity , the value of a proof of lemma [ l : variational ] is that in the course of the calculations , a number of properties of extremals are identified ; these have direct implications for the rest of our calculations .",
    "more exactly , they identify the measure change which we use in section [ s : measurechange ] . more generally ,",
