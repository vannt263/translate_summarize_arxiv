    "elucidating the finite - temperature phase structure of lattice qcd with the wilson quark action is complicated by the fact that the action explicitly breaks chiral symmetry@xcite .",
    "last year we reported an analysis of this problem@xcite based on the idea of spontaneous breakdown of parity and flavor symmetry@xcite .",
    "the main findings , obtained through simulations of the two - flavor system on an @xmath1 lattice , were that ( i ) the critical line , defined as the line of vanishing pion screening mass for finite temporal lattice sizes , does not extend to arbitrarily weak coupling , but turns back toward strong coupling at a finite value of @xmath2 , forming a cusp on the @xmath3 plane , and ( ii ) the thermal line of finite - temperature transition @xmath4 runs past the tip of the cusp without crossing the critical line .",
    "we have also argued , based on analytical considerations including those of the two - dimensional gross - neveu model , that the cusp will move toward weak coupling as the temporal size @xmath5 increases , pushing the thermal line in front and eventually pinching it at @xmath6 and @xmath7 as @xmath8 . in our view",
    "it is only in this limit that the true chiral phase transition emerges .",
    "while this view provides a consistent picture on how chiral phase transition arises for the wilson quark action , we have left unanswered several important questions to be clarified .",
    "these are ( i ) an explicit demonstration that parity - flavor symmetry is spontaneously broken inside the cusp , ( ii ) how the phase diagram depends on the number of flavors @xmath9 , in particular if the chiral transition is of first order for @xmath10 as predicted by the sigma model analysis , and ( iii ) how the tip of the cusp moves for an increasing temporal lattice size . in this article , we present results of our study on these questions carried out since last year .",
    "spontaneous breakdown of parity - flavor symmetry inside the cusp is signaled by a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value of the pion field .",
    "for the case of two flavors @xmath11 which we analyze , one may take the pion condensate to point in the @xmath12 direction @xmath13 .",
    "the pion spectrum will then consist of a massive @xmath14 and massless @xmath15 which are the nambu - goldstone modes of the broken symmetry .    in order to ascertain these predictions",
    "we carry out hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) simulations , adding a symmetry - breaking term @xmath16 to the action to avoid infrared divergences due to massless @xmath15 modes .",
    "runs are made on an @xmath1 lattice at @xmath17 with @xmath18 in steps of @xmath19 .",
    "the range for the hopping parameter includes the interval @xmath20 previously estimated to be the parity broken phase@xcite . for the external field",
    "we take @xmath21 , 0.1 , 0.05 , 0.02 and 0.01 . for each value of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ,",
    "typically @xmath24 trajectories with 0.5 time units are made for thermalization followed by 50 trajectories for measurements .",
    "the presence of external field significantly reduces fluctuations , and we find these statistics to be sufficient .",
    "hadron screening masses are calculated by periodically doubling the lattice in the spatial directions .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we plot the parity - flavor order parameter @xmath25 as a function of @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "vertical lines mark the position of the critical lines at @xmath17 .",
    "we clearly observe that the order parameter inside the cusp ( _ i.e. _ , between the two critical values @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) tends to a non - vanishing value as the external field @xmath23 is reduced , while it decreases toward zero outside .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ]    the @xmath15 screening mass squared is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) as a function of @xmath26 and in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) as a function of @xmath23 . inside the cusp",
    "@xmath30 decreases toward zero , while outside it converges toward values calculated with @xmath31(open squares ) . for @xmath32 and 0.24 , which are inside the cusp , lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) show quadratic fits of form @xmath33 .",
    "a small non - vanishing value of the intercept @xmath34 is ascribed to finite spatial size effects .",
    "we conclude that the behavior of both the parity - flavor order parameter and @xmath30 strongly supports spontaneous breakdown of parity - flavor symmetry inside the cusp .",
    "an interesting point to note is that @xmath30 converges to the limit @xmath31 from below for @xmath35 , while the approach is from above for @xmath36 . in other words ,",
    "the parity - flavor broken phase is enlarged beyond the upper part of the critical line in the presence of the external field .",
    "we also mention that extracting the @xmath14 mass inside the cusp requires computation of disconnected quark loop contribution in the @xmath14 propagator .",
    "this may be carried out with the technique of wall source without gauge fixing previously applied to the @xmath37 propagator@xcite .",
    "we leave this interesting problem for future work .",
    "our analysis of the @xmath0 system is made for the dual purpose of confirming the cusp structure of the critical line and examining the dependence of the order of chiral transition on @xmath9 .",
    "hmc runs with @xmath31 are carried out on an @xmath1 lattice at @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "thermalization of @xmath24 trajectories with 0.5 time units followed by @xmath40 trajectories for measurements are made at each @xmath2 and @xmath22 , chaining runs in @xmath22 for each value of @xmath2 .",
    "the location of the critical line is estimated from results of @xmath41 calculated on a spatially doubled lattice , and the position and order of the thermal transition is examined through behavior of physical quantities and their time histories .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we show the phase diagram for @xmath0 together with that for @xmath11 previously reported@xcite .",
    "we find a cusp structure similar to that of @xmath11 except for a shift of @xmath42 toward stronger coupling , which we qualitatively expect from a larger magnitude of sea quark effects for @xmath0 .",
    "we also find strong first - order signals across the thermal line away from the tip of the cusp as marked by solid squares .",
    "surprisingly , however , the transition becomes weaker toward the tip of the cusp , apparently turning into a smooth crossover at @xmath43 .",
    "the location of the crossover is indicated by open rectangles in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ]    the smoothing of the transition close to the cusp is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) for @xmath41 and in ( b ) for the polyakov line @xmath44 . jumps in physical quantities are apparent at @xmath45 and 3.5 . however , at @xmath46 and 2.0 , data taken for increasing and decreasing values of @xmath22 overlap with each other and do not show any sign of discontinuity .    at @xmath47 runs",
    "are also made with an increased spatial size of @xmath48 .",
    "results for @xmath41 plotted by open circles do not show deviation from those on an @xmath1 lattice .",
    "thus it is unlikely that finite - size effects has rounded a first - order discontinuity into a smooth crossover on an @xmath49 lattice .",
    "a possible interpretation of the smoothing is that it is caused by an explicit breaking of chiral symmry in the the wilson quark action , whose effect is larger for stronger coupling .",
    "if one increases the temporal lattice size @xmath5 , the cusp and the line of thermal transition will both move toward weaker coupling .",
    "therefore the first - order transition may become extended up to and beyond the tip of the cusp for sufficiently large @xmath5 .",
    "another possibility is that the first - order transition we find is a lattice artifact , sharing its origin with the sharpening of the @xmath11 transition observed at @xmath50@xcite .",
    "this possibility does not contradict the report of a first - order transition for @xmath51@xcite .",
    "in fact the interval @xmath52 where first - order signals were observed is away from the cusp expected at @xmath53 .",
    "also we think that the divergence of runs at @xmath53 from a hot and a mixed starting configurations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite is an indication that the runs were made inside the parity - broken phase rather than a signal of metastability .    for either of the two possibilities above ,",
    "if the chiral phase transition is of first order for @xmath10 in the continuum , it will emerge only for larger @xmath5 for which the cusp and the thermal line move into the scaling region toward weak coupling .",
    "discussions of the previous section naturally raise the question how the cusp of the critical line moves when the temporal lattice size is increased . to examine this problem",
    ", we analyze the critical line for an @xmath54 lattice for @xmath11 and 4 systems .",
    "we do not repeat a description of simulation details since they are similar to those for an @xmath1 lattice .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] we plot the critical line estimated from the pion mass .",
    "we observe that the cusp is clearly shifted toward weak coupling . however , the magnitude of shift is quite small both for @xmath11 and 4 so that the tip of cusp is still in the region of strong coupling for @xmath55 .",
    "let us note that previous results by the qcdpax collaboration for @xmath11 also indicate that the tip of the cusp is located at @xmath56 for @xmath57 and at @xmath58 even for @xmath59@xcite .",
    "a recent study on a symmetric lattice employing parity - flavor breaking external fields also shows that the cusp is located below @xmath60 up to @xmath61@xcite .",
    "these results imply that a substantial increase in the temporal lattice size is needed before the cusp and the thermal line move into the scaling region ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xmath62 for @xmath11 ) .    we should emphasize that this result has a significant impact also for spectrum calculations at zero temperature .",
    "since the location of the cusp is controlled by the smaller of the temporal and spatial lattice sizes , unless the spatial size is taken sufficiently large , critical hopping parameter will be absent , leading to systematic errors in measured hadron masses .",
    "overall our study indicates that within the plaquette gauge action and the wilson quark action large lattice sizes are needed for an exploration of continuum properties of the chiral phase transition .",
    "the associated computational difficulties point toward application of improvement ideas@xcite to achieve further progress in finite - temperature studies with the wilson - type quark actions ."
