    "charged current weak interactions proceed via the exchange of a @xmath14 boson and are theoretically described by a vertex factor that has a pure vector minus axial - vector ( @xmath15 ) structure  @xcite .",
    "while weak interactions have been tested with high precision at low momentum transfers , e.g. in radioactive @xmath16-decay , the vertex structure may be altered in interactions at high momentum transfers due to new physics contributions . among the known fundamental particles , the top quark stands out as the heaviest , with a mass of @xmath17  @xcite , and thereby gives access to high momentum scales .",
    "it has been suggested that the top quark may have non - universal gauge couplings as a result of dynamical breaking of the electroweak symmetry  @xcite .    given our present knowledge of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark - mixing matrix  @xcite , the top quark decays with a branching ratio close to 100% in the mode @xmath18 .",
    "the dirac structure of the @xmath4 vertex can be generalized by the interaction lagrangian    @xmath19 + h.c.\\;,\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 $ ]  @xcite . in general the interaction of fermions and gauge bosons",
    "can be expressed by six form factors . assuming the @xmath3 boson to be on - shell",
    ", the number of form factors is reduced to four .",
    "these four form factors @xmath22 can assume complex values in general , but take values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 in standard electroweak theory , such that the production of right - handed @xmath3 bosons from top - quark decay is suppressed . a general strategy to experimentally determine all four form factors in eq .",
    "[ eq : wtb ] involves the measurement of the @xmath3-boson helicity fractions and the measurement of the single top - quark production cross - section in the @xmath25-channel and in the @xmath26-channel  @xcite .",
    "the production of longitudinally polarized @xmath3 bosons is enhanced due to the large yukawa coupling of the top quark to the higgs field responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "the fraction of right - handed @xmath3 bosons , @xmath1 , is predicted to be very small @xmath27  @xcite , which is well below the sensitivity of the measurements reported here .",
    "the partial decay widths into the different @xmath3-boson helicity states explicitly depend on the form factors . assuming the standard electroweak theory values for the form factors the fraction of longitudinally polarized @xmath3 bosons is given by @xmath28  @xcite at leading order in perturbation theory , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 indicate longitudinally and transversely polarized @xmath3 bosons , respectively . for @xmath31",
    "as given above and a @xmath3-boson mass of @xmath32  @xcite the theory predicts @xmath33 .",
    "next - to - leading - order corrections decrease the total decay width , as well as @xmath34 , by about 10%  @xcite , while @xmath2 is only changed by about 1%  @xcite .",
    "a significant deviation of @xmath2 or @xmath1 from the predictions exceeding the 1% level would be a clear indication of new physics .",
    "this article reports the results of two analyses using the same dataset and their combination .",
    "both analyses use the observable @xmath35 , which is the cosine of the decay angle of the charged lepton in the @xmath3-boson decay frame measured with respect to the top - quark direction .",
    "this has the following distribution : @xmath36 the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 are the @xmath3-boson helicity fractions to be determined .",
    "the two analyses estimate @xmath35 for each event by reconstructing the full @xmath37 kinematics .",
    "these methods of reconstructing the four - vectors of the top - quark and antitop - quark as well as their decay products  @xcite possess a broad applicability and offer the possibility to measure a full set of top - quark properties , such as the top - quark mass and the forward - backward charge asymmetry in @xmath37 production  @xcite .",
    "experimental acceptances and resolutions introduce distortions of the @xmath35 distribution which must also be taken into account .",
    "the two analyses employ alternative methods for reconstructing the @xmath37 kinematics , for correcting the experimental effects , and for determining the polarization fractions from the resulting @xmath35 distributions in the observed events .",
    "they have similar sensitivities and are combined , taking into account correlations , to yield the most precise estimates of @xmath2 and @xmath1 . both analyses",
    "subject the observed data to fits in three different scenarios :    1 .",
    "measure @xmath38 under the assumption that @xmath39 .",
    "this corresponds to a model in which the form factors @xmath40 and @xmath41 are zero , meaning there are no right - handed bottom - quark couplings present .",
    "2 .   measure @xmath42 under the assumption that @xmath43 , which is sensitive to models with @xmath44 , i.e. the presence of an additional @xmath45 current in top - quark decay , but no additional magnetic couplings . using the relation @xmath46",
    "one can translate the measured helicity fractions into the ratio of form factors .",
    "measure @xmath38 and @xmath42 simultaneously in a two - parameter fit , which is model - independent .",
    "model - dependent measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath1 using smaller datasets have been previously reported by the cdf  @xcite and  @xcite collaborations .",
    "most recently the collaboration has reported a model - independent result using @xmath47  @xcite of tevatron data .",
    "the measurements reported here use twice as much data and improved analysis techniques and yield the most precise determinations of the @xmath3-boson helicity fractions in top - quark decays .",
    "the data used for the analyses reported here are collected by the cdf ii detector  @xcite .",
    "we select events of the type @xmath0 , which yield an experimental signature of one high energy charged lepton , missing transverse energy due to the undetected neutrino , and at least four jets , two of which are @xmath48-quark jets .",
    "exactly one isolated electron candidate with transverse energy  @xcite @xmath49 and pseudorapidity  @xcite @xmath50 is required , or exactly one isolated muon candidate with transverse momentum  @xcite @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "an electron or muon candidate is considered isolated if the @xmath53 not assigned to the lepton in a cone of @xmath54 , centered around the lepton , is less than 10% of the lepton @xmath53 or @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "jets are reconstructed by summing calorimeter energy in a cone of radius @xmath56 .",
    "the energy of the jets is corrected for differences as a function of @xmath57 , time , and additional energy depositions due to multiple interactions occurring in the same event  @xcite .",
    "an additional correction leads from calorimeter based jets to jets at the particle level .",
    "candidate jets must have corrected @xmath49 and detector @xmath58 .",
    "events are required to have at least four jets .",
    "the corrected missing transverse energy  @xcite  accounts for the energy corrections made for all jets with corrected @xmath59 and @xmath60 and for muons and is required to be greater than @xmath61 .",
    "at least one jet in the event has to contain a secondary vertex identified using the algorithm described in  @xcite and consistent with having originated from a @xmath48-hadron decay .",
    "additional requirements further reduce the background contribution as follows .",
    "electron events are rejected if the electrons originate from a conversion of a photon .",
    "cosmic ray muon events are rejected as well . to remove @xmath62 bosons , events in which the charged lepton can be paired with any more",
    "loosely defined jet or lepton to form an invariant mass consistent with the @xmath62 peak , @xmath63 , are excluded . with these selection criteria ,",
    "we select 484 @xmath37 candidates in a sample corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of @xmath64 .",
    "kinematic resolutions and selection and reconstruction efficiencies for @xmath37 events are determined utilizing pythia  @xcite and herwig  @xcite  event generators where the top - quark mass is set to @xmath65 .",
    "samples of events generated with pythia , alpgen  @xcite , and madevent  @xcite , interfaced to pythia parton showering are used to determine certain background rates and to estimate the @xmath35 distribution for background events . in order to develop and validate the methods presented , madevent and a custom version of herwig",
    "are used to generate samples of simulated events with controllable @xmath3-boson helicity fractions .",
    "all generated events are passed through the cdf detector simulation  @xcite and then reconstructed in the same way as the observed events .",
    "the selected @xmath37  sample is estimated to be contaminated with about 87 events coming from background processes .",
    "these non-@xmath37 processes originate mainly from @xmath3+jets events with a falsely reconstructed secondary vertex ( mistags ) , from @xmath3+jets events in which the jets are real @xmath48- and @xmath66-quark jets ( @xmath3+heavy flavor ) , and multi - jet processes that contain no real @xmath3  boson ( non-@xmath3 ) .",
    "these backgrounds are estimated using a combination of data and monte carlo methods as described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "additional sources of background arise from electroweak processes like diboson production ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) , the production of single top - quarks , and @xmath62 bosons .",
    "these backgrounds are predicted based on their theoretical cross sections and acceptances and efficiencies , which are derived from simulated events .",
