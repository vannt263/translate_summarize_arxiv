    "the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach remains the most widely used methodology for generating random variates from high dimensional distributions .",

    "ergodic _ if there exists an @xmath4 such that for all @xmath5 there is positive probability of traveling from any state @xmath6 to any other state @xmath7 in @xmath8 steps . for ergodic chains ,",
    "the limiting distribution of @xmath9 will equal the stationary distribution of the chain . using well known methodologies",
    ", it is straightforward to build markov chains whose stationary distribution matches a target distribution @xmath0 .",
    "( see  @xcite for more details . )",
    "one ingredient is missing : the question of how large @xmath10 must be before the distribution of @xmath9 is close to @xmath0 in some sense such as total variation .",
    "this @xmath10 is known as the _ mixing time _ of a markov chain , and unless it can be found for the chain in question , mcmc remains a heuristic rather than an algorithm for approximate sampling .",
    "a breakthrough occurred when jerrum and sinclair developed the ideas of _ conductance _ and _ canonical paths _ into tools capable of proving the mixing time for complex chains on high dimensional spaces . in @xcite , they utilized conductance to show that a chain of broder  @xcite for generating uniformly from the perfect matchings of a graph was rapidly mixing under a condition that encompassed a range of interesting problems such as uniform generation of regular graphs  @xcite .",
    "the development of canonical paths for the ising model  @xcite followed .",
    "the use of approximate samples derived from a markov chain together with selfreducibility  @xcite yields an approximation for the partition function of the ising model , and this is still the only fully polynomial time randomized approximation scheme ( fpras ) known for this problem",
    ".    later uses of canonical paths included an extension from perfect matchings to all matchings  @xcite and an algorithm for finding perfect matchings in polynomial time in all graphs ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "canonical path approaches have also been used on such varied problems such as choosing approximately uniformly from a convex set  @xcite and 0 - 1 knapsack solutions  @xcite .",
    "this work is a step towards understanding the relationship between some of these problems .",
    "we show    * sampling from the subgraphs ising model with zero magnitization can be accomplished by generating a perfect matching in a graph linear in the size of the original graph . *",
    "sampling from the subgraphs ising model with positive magnitization on a graph can be accomplished by generating a matching in a graph linear in the size of the original graph . *",
    "sampling from perfect matchings in unbalanced bipartite graphs can be reduced to sampling from perfect matchings in balanced bipartite graphs . *",
    "sampling from matchings in a bipartite graph can be reduced to sampling from perfect matchings in a bipartite graph .",
    "matchings in unbalanced bipartite graphs arise in the approximation of the permanent of rectangular matrices , used in bounding the performance of digital mobile radio systems ( see  @xcite . )",
    "while conductance could be used directly to bound the mixing time of an appropriate chain for this problem , it is easier to just utilize a sampling reduction .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "section  [ sec : unbalanced2balanced ] presents the reduction from unbalanced bipartite graphs to balanced bipartite graphs while section  [ sec : matchings2perfectmatchings ] gives the reduction from matchings to perfect matchings in bipartite graphs .",
    "finally section  [ sec : consequences ] notes how this reduction leads to deterministic bounds on the ising partition function for large magnitization problems .",
    "this section describes the three models that will appear throughout the paper : the ising model , weighted matchings in graphs ( the monomer - dimer model in physics ) , and weighted perfect matchings in graphs ( the dimer model ) .",
    "each of these three problems is presented in terms of a weight function @xmath11 where @xmath6 is a configuration in state space @xmath1 .",

    "while the spins formulation is the most widely known , the subgraphs formulation will be of most use here ( as was also the case in  @xcite . )    given a graph @xmath14 , the state space for the subgraphs world is @xmath15 , so that each state , also known as a configuration , indexes a subgraph of @xmath16 .",
    "like many distributions of interest , the subgraphs world is given as a nonnegative weight function over configurations that is normalized by the partition function .",
    "the parameters for the subgraphs world are as follows .",

    "moreover , the normalizing constant for the subgraphs world @xmath27 is a multiple of the normalizing constant for the spins world , and the multiple can be calculated explicitly ( see  @xcite . )    calculation of the partition function @xmath27 was shown in  @xcite to be a @xmath28 complete problem for general graphs , and so it is unlikely that a polynomial time algorithm for finding @xmath27 exactly will be found .

    "there exists an algorithm for computing @xmath31 when the graph @xmath16 is planar ( @xcite ) , but for general graphs the problem is @xmath32 complete ( see  @xcite . )    [ [ perfect - matchings ] ] perfect matchings + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a _ perfect matching _ in a general graph is a collection of edges such that every node is adjacent to exactly one edge .",

    "node @xmath101 is connected to the first two neighbors of @xmath19 , while @xmath102 is connected to the remaining neighbors of @xmath19 .",
    "finally , the nodes @xmath101 and @xmath102 are connected .",
    "figure  [ fig : expansion ] illustrates this process .",

    "there are two values for this edge , and so the sum consists of two terms .      when @xmath117 , then whether edge @xmath125 is 1 or 0 in @xmath127 , exactly one of @xmath101 and @xmath102 has odd degree , while the other is even .",
    "hence a factor of @xmath128 or @xmath129 is contributed to the weight , but a factor of @xmath130 is missing so @xmath131 for one term in the sum , and @xmath132 in the other term . hence ( [ eqn : verify ] ) becomes : @xmath133    on the other hand , when @xmath19 has even degree , one choice of @xmath134 leads to both @xmath101 and @xmath102 having odd degree , while with the other choice both have even degree .",

    "the downside of this construction is that the magnetic field is smaller at each of the duplicated nodes since @xmath139 unless @xmath140 , in which case they are equal .",
    "the good news is that once @xmath141 it can be replaced by @xmath142 without changing the distribution too much .",
    "when @xmath130 is this small , the chance that a draw from @xmath119 will result in all nodes having even degree is at least @xmath143 so simple acceptance rejection can be used  @xcite .    consider starting with a graph @xmath14 and repeatedly applying this reduction until the maximum degree of the graph is 3 . then the number of new edges created at each node equals the degree of the node minus 3 .",

    "a degree 1 node with magnetic field is linked only to its nearest neighbor , so it makes that neighbor a little more likely to be spin up , which is the same as increasing its magnetic field .",
