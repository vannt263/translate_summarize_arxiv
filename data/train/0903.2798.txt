    "the presence of a very compact infrared source in the nucleus of the seyfert galaxy ngc4151 was first suggested by the observations of @xcite , who reported photometric variations of the galaxy nucleus both in the optical and in the near - infrared ( hereafter near - ir ) .",
    "a close inspection of the light curves shown by @xcite suggests a delay between the near - ir and optical variations , recently confirmed by @xcite , who could better quantify its value as 48@xmath5 days .",
    "these authors concluded that the @xmath6band emission is dominated by thermal radiation from hot dust located at @xmath70.04pc from the nucleus .",
    "a similar intepretation was previously proposed by @xcite , via models fitted to a large aperture ( @xmath88 ) nuclear optical and near - ir spectrum , concluding that in the near - ir the emission is dominated by thermal reradiation by hot dust with temperature @xmath9k .",
    "@xcite have reported neutral hydrogen absorption in vla radio observations with subparsec linear resolution , close to the systemic velocity of the galaxy , interpreted as due to a clumpy gas layer suggested to be associated to a circumnuclear obscuring torus . according to @xcite , this absorption is observed along the line of sight towards the first component of the radio counterjet , at @xmath100.1pc from the nucleus , thus consistent with the estimated inner radius of @xmath70.04pc derived by @xcite .",
    "the interpretation put forth by @xcite  that the obscuring torus is not in front of the active galactic nucleus ( agn )  is necessary in order to reconcile the radio observations with the uv / optical observations which show a blue nuclear continuum and broad emission lines , indicating that both the nuclear source and the broad - line region are visible .",
    "the presence of a dusty torus around the nucleus of ngc4151 was disputed by @xcite on the basis of interferometric observations at 2.2@xmath11 m using the two 10 m keck telescopes .",
    "these authors found a marginally resolved nuclear source @xmath100.1pc in diameter ",
    "consistent with the observations of both @xcite and @xcite , but favor an origin for this emission in thermal gas from the accretion disk , arguing that previous nuclear spectra of ngc4151 did not show an `` infrared bump '' , in apparent contradiction with the previous study by @xcite .",
    "such a bump is expected if a dusty torus is present , due to reprocessing of uv / optical radiation from the central engine ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the alternative interpretation proposed by @xcite seems nevertheless to be in line with recent results presented by @xcite , who studied the distribution of [ oiii]@xmath125007 and [ oii]@xmath123727 emission in the narrow line region ( nlr ) of ngc4151 .",
    "these authors pointed out that there does not seem to be a region of complete shadow around the apex of the bicone , as significant ionized gas emission is found there , although with a lower ionization parameter , consistent with a weaker ionizing flux . @xcite",
    "propose that the attenuation of the nuclear radiation could be due to low - ionization absorbers swept out by a wind originating in the accretion disk , suggesting that there is no need for a `` classical , doughnut - shaped '' torus in order to explain the observed light distributions , in agreement with recent modelling for the obscuring region around an agn @xcite .",
    "in this work , we present new observations of the nucleus of ngc4151 with the gemini near infrared integral field spectrograph ( nifs ) at an angular resolution of 0@xmath112  corresponding to a spatial resolution of a few pc at the galaxy  which is much improved relative to previous spectroscopic studies .",
    "our observations clearly reveal the presence of an unresolved nuclear source in the near - ir .",
    "we have already used the nifs data to map the excitation ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) and kinematics @xcite of the nlr . in the present paper",
    ", we use the nuclear spectrum , combined with surrounding extranuclear spectra and a _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) optical spectrum , in order to isolate the emission of the infrared nuclear source , which is consistent with that predicted for the torus postulated in the unified model of agns @xcite .",
    "we adopt a distance to ngc4151 of 13.3mpc , corresponding to a scale at the galaxy of 65pcarcsec@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section2",
    ", we present a summary of the observations , in section3 we present the results and in section4 we present and discuss our conclusions .",
    "two - dimensional spectroscopic data were obtained on the gemini north telescope with the instrument nifs @xcite operating with the adaptive optics module altair on the nights of december 12 and 13 , 2006 .",
    "the observations covered the spectral bands z , j , h and k , at spectral resolutions of 4990 , 6040 , 5290 and 5290 , respectively , resulting in a wavelength coverage from 0.94@xmath11 m to 2.40@xmath11 m .",
    "more details of the observations and reduction procedures can be found in @xcite .    in the present paper we concentrate on the analysis of the nuclear continuum .",
    "the spatial profiles of the nuclear region of the galaxy in the k and j bands are shown in fig.[psf ] , in comparison with stellar profiles .",
    "the nuclear source  which has a full width at half maximuum ( fwhm ) of 012@xmath14002 in the k - band and 016@xmath14002 in the j - band  corresponding to 8.0@xmath141.3pc and 10.4@xmath141.3pc at the galaxy , respectively  is unresolved by our observations , in spite of the fact that their spatial profiles are marginally broader than those of the stars in fig.[psf ] .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this is due to the much shorter exposures of the stellar observations .    in order to include as much as possible of the nuclear source",
    ", we have chosen an extraction aperture of 03 radius which includes the nuclear flux down to 10% of the peak value in the k - band , as illustrated by the dashed lines in fig.[psf ] .",
    "m.the spectra are shown in arbitrary flux units and are shifted by a constant for clarity . ]",
    "the nuclear spectrum is shown in the fig.[spec ] , together with extranuclear spectra obtained through similar 0@xmath13 apertures at distances of 09ne , 09sw , 18ne , and 18sw from the nucleus , normalized to the flux of the nuclear spectrum at @xmath15 m .",
    "fluxes of more than 50 emission lines have been measured and listed in table 1 of paper i for the nuclear and two extranuclear spectra .    from fig.[spec ] , as well as from spectra shown in paper i",
    ", we observe that the extranuclear spectra are blue at all locations around the nucleus . as this blue continuum",
    "is observed up to at least 2arcsec from the nucleus , it can not be due to the agn and can thus be attributed to a young stellar population surrounding the nucleus .",
    "absorption features from stellar co bands are indeed observed in the k band , marked by vertical dotted lines in fig.[spec ] . only right at the nucleus the continuum is clearly very red .",
    "similar red nuclear continua have been observed for other agns and attributed to emission from hot dust , possibly from a dusty torus around the supermassive black hole , with temperature close to the dust sublimation temperature @xcite .          in order to better constrain the nuclear spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , we have used an optical stis spectrum of the nucleus extracted within a similar aperture to that of our near - ir spectrum , obtained from the atlas of agn spectra compiled by @xcite .",
    "this spectrum was extracted within an aperture of 02@xmath1601 and covers the spectral range 0.31@xmath11 m .",
    "we have used the continuum region from 9780 to 9820   to normalize the optical spectrum to the same flux as our near - ir spectrum ( which extends down to the z - band ) as there is a flux difference of @xmath730% between the stis spectrum and our nuclear spectrum .",
    "the small difference between the apertures is not important because the stellar contribution , when compared to the nuclear one , is small , as discussed below .",
    "we show the optical plus near - ir spectrum in fig.[fit ] .",
    "the optical continuum is very blue and can be well reproduced by a power - law up to @xmath71@xmath11 m , where there is a change in slope and a red component begins to appear in the near - ir . although the near - ir emission is dominated by this component , the contribution of the power - law in the near - ir is not negligible in the z , j and h bands , as discussed below .",
    "we have modelled the optical@xmath17near - ir nuclear continuum of ngc4151 by the sum of two components : a power law , which seems to dominate in the optical , plus a blackbody function , which dominates in the near - ir , as illustrated in fig.[fit ] .",
    "the fit was performed using the _ nfit1d _ task from the stsdas iraf package , which allows the selection of limited spectral intervals for the fit .",
    "we have excluded the spectral interval between 0.6 and 0.9@xmath11 m from the fit as we have estimated that the contribution of the paschen continuum in this interval ( @xmath18ergs@xmath19s@xmath13a@xmath13 at 8200 ) , is not negligible when compared to the total flux observed in the continuum . moreover ,",
    "the quality of the optical spectrum in its red end is quite poor , and should not be used to constrain the sed . excluding the above spectral region ,",
    "the best fit was obtained for a power law @xmath20 and a blackbody function of temperature @xmath0k , which peaks at @xmath21 m .",
    "the fit of the two functions combined is shown in fig.[fit ] as a continuous line , while the black body component is shown as a dashed line and the power law as dotted line .",
    "we have next evaluated the effect of the underlying stellar population in the fit above .",
    "a stellar population spectrum was extracted from our near - ir datacubes within a ring around the nucleus with inner radius of 06 and outer radius of 09 .",
    "we have then normalized the flux of this extranuclear spectrum to 15% of the peak nuclear flux in the k band , which is the maximum contribution of the stellar population estimated from a spatial profile through the nucleus . under the assumption that the underlying stellar population in the nuclear spectrum is the same as the one from the ring ( which is supported by other spectra from the nuclear vicinity )",
    ", we have then subtracted the extranuclear spectrum from the nuclear one .",
    "as we do not have an extranuclear optical spectrum , we repeated the fit for the near - ir only , comparing the temperature of the uncorrected to the corrected spectrum , concluding that , within the uncertainties ( @xmath750k ) , the blackbody temperature is the same",
    ".    the reddening may also affect the results of the fit .",
    "an estimate of the reddening in the near - ir can be obtained from the emission lines of the narrow - line region .",
    "we have used the [ feii]@xmath22m/@xmath23 m line ratio to calculate the reddening ( as described in paper i , but using the present nuclear spectrum , for an aperture of radius 0@xmath13 ) , resulting in e(b - v)@xmath24 .",
    "it is not clear that this reddening applies to the optical continuum .",
    "if it does , it would result in a very steep power law for the corrected nuclear continuum : using the extinction curve of @xcite , we obtain @xmath25 .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of broad lines in the spectra and the already very blue continuum suggests that the reddening of the optical spectrum is much smaller ; we may be seing the nuclear source through a low extinction window to the nucleus .",
    "this may apply also to the near - ir nuclear source , but , even if the extinction applies , the correction in the near - ir is small .",
    "a reddening correction of only the near - ir spectrum for e(b - v)=0.6 , keeping the power - law index the same , results in a revised blackbody temperature of @xmath3k .      following @xcite and @xcite we can estimate the mass of the hot dust producing the unresolved near infrared emission .",
    "firstly , we obtain the infrared spectral luminosity of each dust grain , in ergs@xmath13hz@xmath13 , assuming that the dust is composed of graphite grains , by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the grain radius , @xmath28 is the absorption efficiency and @xmath29 is its spectral distribution assumed to be a planck function with temperature @xmath30 .",
    "the number of dust grains ( @xmath31 ) can be estimated from the ratio between the total luminosity of the hot dust ( @xmath32 ) and the total luminosity of one dust grain ( @xmath33 ) as @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath32 was obtained by integrating the flux under the planck function fitted to the nuclear spectrum and adopting a distance to ngc4151 of @xmath35mpc , while @xmath33 was obtained by the intregration of equation[lgr ] for a temperature of @xmath36k .",
    "finally , the mass of the emitting hot dust is obtained by :    @xmath37    assuming a graphite density of @xmath38g@xmath39 @xcite , we obtain @xmath40 .",
    "if we assume that the near - ir nuclear source is subject to reddeninng , we should then use the temperature @xmath41k , which will lead to a smaller dust mass of @xmath4 .    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ hd_mass ]    in table[hd_mass ] , we present a comparison of the mass of hot dust obtained here for ngc4151 with the ones derived for other agns in previous works .",
    "this comparison reveals that the hot dust mass for ngc4151 is similar to the ones obtained for ngc1068 by @xcite , for ngc4593 by @xcite and for ngc1566 by @xcite and is smaller than the masses derived for other galaxies such as ngc7582 , mrk1239 , mrk766 , ngc7469 , ngc3783 and fairall9 by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , @xcite observed ngc4151 at 2.2@xmath11 m and have marginally resolved a nuclear source @xmath100.1pc in diameter , concluding that the emission was due to thermal gas from the central accretion disk instead of a dusty torus , as they claimed that previous observations did not show the bump . our near - ir nuclear spectrum ( fig.[spec ] )",
    " clearly shows this bump and favours emission by hot dust as the dominant mechanism for its origin , in agreement with previous studies using larger aperture data @xcite .",
    "a more recent near - ir spectrum obtained by @xcite , although with lower spatial resolution than ours , also suggests the presence of the bump .",
    "the modern view of the torus @xcite is not of a static doughnut shape structure but of a clumpy wind of dusty and optically thick clouds originating in the black - hole accretion disk , a view which has recently been favored also in the case of ngc4151 by @xcite , and which is in partial agreement with the proposition by @xcite .",
    "being clumpy , the dusty wind allows the view of the nuclear source through low - extinction holes .",
    "the presence of such holes is also supported by the observation of ionized gas close to the apex of the bicone , beyond its presumed walls .",
    "this more updated view is also consistent with our data and results from previous papers discussed above , if we consider that the near - ir nuclear source can be identified with the hottest part of the dusty wind , which is the one closest to the nucleus and which emits most of the near - ir radiation .",
    "according to our data , the temperature of this dust is @xmath42k and its mass is @xmath2 , obtained by fitting the optical and near - ir spectrum .",
    "the observation of the nuclear continuum and of the broad emission lines suggest that we are looking to the nuclear source through a low extinction window , in spite of the fact that the estimated reddening from the emission lines of the narrow - line region is e(b - v)=0.6 .",
    "if we assume that this reddening is also affecting the nuclear source , we obtain @xmath43k for the dust temperature and mass @xmath4 .",
    "the temperatures obtained are in good agreement with those previously obtained by @xcite .",
    "comparison between our near - ir flux values with theirs shows that the nucleus was 34 times brighter than in the epoch of our observations , suggesting that the temperature of the hot dust does not depend on the agn luminosity .",
    "regarding the location of the hot dust , our spatial resolution allows us to put only an upper limit to the radius of the infrared source of 4pc ( half the fwhm of the nuclear source ) .",
    "similar scales have been probed by @xcite , who found a heavily obscured starburst closer than 9pc from the nucleus in ngc1097 and argued that it could be located in the outskirts of the torus .",
    "@xcite using mid - ir interferomentric observations constrained the dust emission in ngc1068 to originate in a region of only 1pc diameter . in the case of ngc4151 ,",
    "optical and near - ir monitoring observations of @xcite provide a better constraint on the location of the inner radius of the torus at @xmath70.04pc from the nucleus .",
    "the nlr of ngc4151 has an approximate biconical morphology with projected opening angle of @xmath875@xmath44 and with its axis oriented along a pa @xmath860/240@xmath44 ( ne  sw ) .",
    "the sw side of the bicone is tilted toward us , making an angle of 45@xmath44 with the line - of - sight , according to @xcite , who gives also an opening angle of the cone of 66@xmath44 , which puts our line - of - sight just outside the cone wall .",
    "if the torus is oriented perpendicularly to the cone , we are looking down into the torus hole .",
    "this allows us to constrain the half - height of the torus to less than 0.04pc for a `` doughnut shape '' opaque torus .",
    "this torus should extend to at least 0.1pc from the nucleus , in order to contain the neutral hydrogen clouds observed by @xcite .",
    "as proposed by these authors , the ne part of the radio jet would be behind the torus , while the sw part would be in front of it .",
