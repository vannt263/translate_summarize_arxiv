    "a key innovation in theoretical solid state physics in the last fifty years was the reformulation of quantum mechanics in a density formalism , based on the hohenberg - kohn theorem @xcite . despite initial resistance ,",
    "in particular from quantum chemists , the method has replaced previous frameworks and provides , to date , the most advanced theoretical model for the calculation of atoms , solids , and liquids . however , its implementation relies on a rather cumbersome detour . while the hohenberg - kohn theorem is formulated exclusively in terms of electron densities and energy functionals , calculations today",
    "are based almost exclusively on the specifications given by kohn and sham one year after the initial theorem was made public @xcite . while this procedure is generally successful , and implemented today in numerical methods optimized for efficiency ( see e.g the ingenious way ionic and electron degrees of freedom are treated on much the same footing following a method developed by car and parinello @xcite ) , it is highly inefficient in one crucial conceptual point : if , according to the hohenberg - kohn theorem , the electron density is the only physically relevant variable of the system , then solving the schrdinger equation , setting up the eigenvectors , and computing the density of electrons is an operation , which creates a vast amount of redundant information .",
    "every information , pertaining to the solution of the single - particle schrdinger equation and the summation of single electron charges is discarded at the end of every step in the iteration cycle .",
    "one could therefore say that more than 90% of the information created in today s simulations is actually irrelevant .",
    "the question thus arises : _ do we have to create this information at all , or can we find a more direct way to arrive at the groundstate density of electrons without this cumbersome detour via the single - particle schrdinger equation ? _    in 1984 , levy , perdew , and sahni ( lps ) published an intriguing relation @xcite , in which the density of charge is described by a second order differential equation without any reference to kohn - sham orbitals @xcite .",
    "it introduced the possibility to formulate the many - electron problem with just one quantity , the electron density . in this respect",
    "it seemed to be more in line with the original hohenberg - kohn theorem @xcite than standard methods in density functional theory , based on the kohn - sham equations @xcite . in the last twenty years",
    ", developments in this field focussed on a search for suitable density functional approximations , especially for kinetic energy functionals .",
    "it is by now an expansive field of research in theoretical solid state physics and quantum chemistry .",
    "the main results of subsequent work on the lps relation @xcite are : the usage of systematically constructed harriman orbitals @xcite in a three - dimensional generalisation @xcite ; the introduction and analysis of the pauli potential @xcite ; the analysis of the uniqueness and asymptotic behaviour of the local kinetic energy @xcite ; the properties of the kinetic energy density @xcite ; and weighted or averaged density approximation @xcite . for a comprehensive review , see @xcite .",
    "the list is , of course , not complete .",
    "in particular it does not contain references to the development of the kohn - sham theory , e.g. the continued improvement of exchange - correlation functionals , as this is not the topic of the present paper . here , we want to reexamine the original lps relation and its properties .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ loc_prop ] we describe the local properties of the lps equation and find that it entails conservation of energy density throughout a quantum mechanical system . in section [ atom_ana ]",
    "we give the results of analytic applications of the lps relation for the hydrogen atom .",
    "we find that the effective potential is the sum of a non - zero hartree potential and an equally non - zero general exchange - correlation potential .",
    "the effective potential is zero due to cancellation of the two contributions . in section [ gen_xc_pot ]",
    "we analyse the physical origin of this cancellation and find that motion of single electrons creates a vector potential @xmath0 , called the _ inertial field _ due to its relation to electron motion . due to this potential the root of the charge density acquires an additional complex phase .",
    "the phase - shift is in line with an aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "based on these findings we formulate the general problem for an @xmath1-electron system in section [ gen_prob ] . finally , in section [ sum_dis ] we discuss the results and estimate their importance for the development of orbital free density functional methods .",
    "a closer analysis reveals that the genuine novelty of the lps relation seems to have been disregarded to this date .",
    "it is the conservation of energy at a local level .",
    "this is well in advance of the single - particle schrdinger equation or a many - body framework , where energy is conserved only globally .",
    "we start with the lps relation , @xmath2 \\rho({\\bf r})^{1/2 } = \\mu \\rho({\\bf r})^{1/2},\\ ] ] rearranging as @xmath3 and multiplying by @xmath4 results in @xmath5 we will show that the potential at a point @xmath6 multiplied by the charge density at this point , describes the potential energy density . thus the equation is nothing else but a description of energy conservation for every point of the system , @xmath7 here , we have symbolized the term @xmath8 by a total energy density @xmath9 .",
    "each term refers to a corresponding energy density .",
    "the resulting equation is equivalent to the lps relation , which therefore contains energy conservation also in its general form .",
    "since the relation between potentials and energy densities may not be directly accessible , we derive them in the following from fundamental considerations .    the kinetic energy density @xmath10 is formulated for interacting bosonic @xcite particles",
    ". it can exactly be rewritten in a more useful manner , @xmath11 ^ 2}{\\rho({\\bf r})}= t(\\rho({\\bf r}),\\nabla\\rho({\\bf r}),\\nabla^2\\rho({\\bf r})).\\ ] ] the usefulness of this formulation will be seen further down .",
    "it should be noted that the second term of the above expression is the von weizscker kinetic energy density @xcite . for electron charge contained in an infinitesimal volume @xmath12 around a point @xmath6",
    ", the contribution to the interaction energy between electrons and nuclei @xmath13 will be @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of nuclei and @xmath16 the charge of the @xmath17th nucleus .",
    "the electron - nuclear energy density at a point @xmath6 is then @xmath18 the effective potential contains the explicit electron - electron interaction ( hartree potential , @xmath19 ) and a generalized exchange - correlation potential ( gxc - potential , @xmath20 ) which includes the exchange and correlation effects , as well as the potential contributions due to pauli exclusion , @xmath21 .",
    "the contribution to the hartree energy from the electron distribution between two infinitesimal volume @xmath12 and @xmath22 around points @xmath6 and @xmath23 respectively is @xmath24 integrating over @xmath22 and rearranging the results leads to the hartree energy density at point @xmath6 , @xmath25 the same behaviour is found for the general exchange - correlation energy density , @xmath26 although at this point the exact form of @xmath20 is not known .",
    "so far we have proved that the left hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ locenergy ] ) and ( [ locenergy2 ] ) are the same term by term . in order to prove that the total energy density is equal to the chemical potential times the electron density ( @xmath27 ) we employ the variational principle to minimize the total energy .",

    "@xcite . in the lps relation",
    ", it describes the eigenvalue of the problem , and the change of the total energy , if one electron is removed from the system if @xmath32 @xcite .    here , we find the first unconventional implication of the lps equation",
    ". since it is not specified , in the derivation of the chemical potential from the lps relation @xcite , which electron is actually removed from the system , the chemical potential must be equal for the removal of any single electron . in this case",
    ", it is only possible , like in standard dft , to think of a many - electron system as composed of a discrete number of electrons with different energy levels , if we assume that the system will balance the removal of one electron by a change of all electronic eigenstates so that the highest electronic eigenstate remains empty .",
    "but from the previous derivation we may also conclude that @xmath33 describes the total energy of the system . in this case",
    ", @xmath29 must have a double meaning : it is , firstly , the energy eigenvalue of the @xmath1-electron system ; and @xmath34 is equal to the total energy .",
    "secondly , it is also the chemical potential of the system , or the negative ionization energy .",
    "this result differs from standard dft , where the total energy is a sum containing the discrete energy levels of every single eigenstate .    to understand the difference we revert to the proof by lps that @xmath29 is the negative ionization energy of a single electron removed from the @xmath1-electron system ,",

    "( [ exc ] ) , then the general exchange - correlation potential does not explicitly depend on the electron density .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the standard formulations in dft , where exchange - correlations not only depend on the density of charge , but are generally parametrized in terms of the density ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the energy conservation on a local level , i.e. , at every point @xmath43 of the system , can thus be directly deduced from the lps relation .",
    "comparing the energy densities with the functional derivatives of the corresponding energy terms has another consequence for the kinetic energy density @xmath10 and the kinetic energy functional @xmath44=\\int d^3rt({\\bf r})$ ] .",
    "starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) , integrating over the whole space , performing the functional derivative , and multiplying by the electron density leads again to the kinetic energy density . from that cycle",
    "it can be clearly seen that the kinetic energy density _ can not _",
    "contain arbitrary terms whose space integral vanishes .",
    "this finding is in contrast to previous assumptions @xcite .",
    "it is justified by the local energy conservation of the lps relation itself .",
    "let us analyse the asymptotic behaviour of eq .",
    "( [ fdere ] ) as @xmath45 . after considering that @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite we arrive at @xmath48 which was found by yang et al .",
    "this means that there is no need of approximating the kinetic energy functional , it is exact and unique and has the correct asymptotic behaviour , although it describes non - interacting bosons .",
    "the detailed analysis reveals three important properties of the lps equation :    * the energy density is conserved at a local level ; the total energy density is therefore constant throughout the system .",
    "* the kinetic energy density is unique , it does not contain any arbitrary terms . *",
    "the general exchange - correlation functional does not explicitly depend on the density of charge .    from a practical point of view",
    "we note that self - consistency within the lps framework will be much faster to achieve , since the density distribution is much more restricted .",
    "in particular the requirement that the total energy density must be constant at every point of the system should make the construction of fast algorithms quite easy . in this respect",
    "it must also be noted that solutions of the equation scale with the volume of the system , thus the number of atoms : the method is therefore a true order - n method .",
    "in the following we analyse the results of the lps relation for simple atomic systems containing one electron like h , he@xmath49 , and li@xmath50 . previously , we have found that the direct consequence of the lps equation is the energy conservation on a local level .",
    "@xmath51 as a next step , we analyse the potentials and energy terms which contribute to the total energy , @xmath52 depending on an assumption about electron density . in general , the electron distribution in atoms is spherically symmetric , with the nucleus occupying the centre of the sphere . unless otherwise stated we use atomic units throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "we assume in the following that the electron density decays exponentially within the atom @xmath53 , with @xmath54 .",

    ", i.e.  @xmath72 , where @xmath33 is the sum of the chemical potentials as we build up our system from 1 to n electrons : @xmath73 the single electron eigenvalues @xmath74 can directly be determined by dft .",
    "all terms in eq .",
    "( [ lps ] ) are now parametrized .",
    "the atomic systems are described by three parameters @xmath75 , although , it has to be noted that the form of the electron density considerably changes for @xmath76 which means the above procedure is only valid for atomic systems with one electron .",
    "@xmath77 is directly related to the total energy ( @xmath33 ) , a fact known from experiments and dft calculations : @xmath78 now , we have all the tools to analyse the potentials for systems containing one electron ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the electron distribution of hydrogen can of course be determined analytically , using the single particle schrdinger equation .",
    "however , to elucidate the physical features of the lps model , it is instructive to choose a different route . in case of taking the groundstate ( @xmath80 ) of the hydrogen the three parameters",

    "the effective potential @xmath83 is therefore zero . ]",
    "+ the calculated values @xmath84 and @xmath85 are exactly the same as in the analytical treatment . however , we gain additional insights into the relation between hartree and exchange - correlation potentials : they are not zero , as they would be following the single particle schrdinger equation , but @xmath86 at every @xmath87 .",
    "this behavior also defines the limit for the effective potential @xmath88 . physically speaking",
    ", it indicates that a single electron does not interact with itself , not , as in the conventional picture , because electron - electron repulsion ( @xmath89 ) is zero , but because it is cancelled by exchange - correlation .",
    "for this reason we called @xmath90 the _ general exchange - correlation potential _ , because it is inconceivable , within a statistical many - electron treatment , that it will be non - zero for a single electron .",
    "another important feature of @xmath91 is that it can be negative .",
    "however , this feature was already analysed in detail by sim et al . @xcite .      the mathematical condition for @xmath86",
    "can be determined by comparing the terms in eqs .",
    "( [ vh ] ) and ( [ vgxc ] ) .",
    "it is @xmath92 .",
    "since , according to eq .",
    "( [ etot1 ] ) : @xmath93 which is always true for @xmath79 .",
    "if the total energy @xmath33 decreases to @xmath94 , then the decay @xmath77 , and , consequently , the effective potential , will be : @xmath95 the energy @xmath33 is therefore the minimum energy of the hydrogen atom ; the actual energy is bound from below . the atom is thus stabilized by repulsive electron - electron interactions , which _ can not _",
    "be more than compensated by exchange - correlation interactions .",
    "a decrease of the energy , and thus an implosion of the atom , is prevented by the fact that exchange - correlation would have to be larger than the repulsive electron - electron interaction .",
    "the physical cause , invoked here to explain atomic stability , is different from the standard one , where it is thought that a decrease of the atomic volume would increase the energy uncertainty of the electron and thus increase the electron s energy .",
    "the standard account is based on the heisenberg uncertainty relations .",
    "the reason we arrive at a different account within the lps framework are the local properties .",
    "since within the standard framework only global properties are accessible , an argument can only be made on the basis of global properties , e.g. volume and energy .",
    "however , the lps framework provides direct access to all _ local _ properties .",
    "therefore the argument can be made on a local basis , via the local interactions of electron density and fields of interactions .",
    "it is tempting to extend the analysis to the general case of isolated electrons . in case of @xmath79 electron",
    "if @xmath62 becomes very small @xmath96 , the effective potential in ( [ veff:4 ] ) will remain zero , because @xmath97 .",
    "electron charge therefore will become close to homogeneous . but also in this case the effect of electron - electron repulsion is cancelled because of exchange - correlation .",
    "this seems to indicate , that regardless of the actual extension of electron charge , electrons will _ not _ experience any repulsion between the charge densities at different regions of the electron : electrons are therefore stable entities .    in the general case @xmath98 the total energy of an arbitrary system of @xmath1 electrons must be greater than @xmath99 this value of @xmath33 gives the exact total energy for a system of non - interacting electrons .",
    "the total energy in this case can not decrease below @xmath33 because this would correspond to an attractive interaction between electrons .",
    "analysing @xmath100 and @xmath101 ions and the @xmath102 excited state of the electron in @xmath103 atom , all systems containing @xmath79 electron , @xmath104 was always found .      to sum up the results of this analysis of hydrogen - like systems : ( i ) we found in all cases that the hartree potential is non - zero .",
    "this is in line with the general concept of dft , where extended distributions of electron charge always have an effect on electrostatic potentials .",
    "( ii ) we also found that the atoms are stable due to the peculiar features of the general exchange correlation potential : it is a negative contribution , equal in magnitude to the hartree potential , which prevents the repulsion of electron charge to have any effect .",
    "the extent of the charge distribution is thus bound from above .",
    "but it is also bound from below , since the general exchange correlation potential does not exceed the magnitude of the hartree potential .",
    "hydrogen - like atoms as well as free electrons are therefore stable entities .",
    "however , at this point the physical nature of this potential remains mysterious : it does not explicitly depend on the charge distribution , as has been generally derived from the lps relation .",
    "it can also not be related to exchange correlation in standard dft , since the systems are composed of only one electron .",
    "at this point we have to look at the physical situation from a more fundamental point of view . in general , electrons are described by three physical properties : ( i ) mass , ( ii ) charge , and ( iii ) spin . from a fundamental point of view ,",
    "one of these properties must be related to the existence and the properties of the general exchange correlation potential .",
    "it is straightforward to exclude charge itself as its origin , since both effects of charge , the electron - electron repulsion , and the electron - nuclear attraction , are part of the description .",
    "mass , even though it fits one of the characteristics of the general exchange correlation , i.e. the attractive nature , can not be responsible for it , because the coupling constant for gravitational interaction is tens of orders of magnitude smaller than the coupling constant for electrostatic interactions .",
    "this leaves only one viable option : the general exchange correlation potential must be related to the magnetic properties of electrons .    in general , motion of charge",
    "is related to the existence of fields .",
    "conversely , fields will affect the motion of charge . from this perspective",
    "the motion of electron charge within a hydrogen atom is likely to create corresponding fields , which shall have an effect on the energy density at a particular point of the system .",
    "there is , however , one restriction : these fields can not be equal to electromagnetic @xmath105 and @xmath106 fields , as this would lead to a change of the energy of the atomic system due to radiation .",
    "the field in question can therefore only be a vector potential @xmath0 .",
    "the kinetic energy operator used in the previous sections does not contain any field components .",
    "for this reason it most likely gives only a limited account of the physical environment .",
    "the existence of a field @xmath0 and the ensuing kinetic energy operator @xmath107 will introduce imaginary components into the schrdinger equation .",
    "real functions @xmath108 are thus not sufficient to describe electrons in this situation .",
    "this requires to generalize the wavefunction for complex phases and to reinvestigate the lps relation according to this change .",
    "the motivation for this procedure is to determine the physical origin of the general exchange correlation potential . to this end",
    "we start with a free electron in a three - dimensional potential well . in this case",
    "the electron can be described as a plane wave , @xmath109 with @xmath110 the volume of the potential well and @xmath111 the momentum of the electron .",
    "the above wavefunction results in a constant electron density , @xmath112 from the above it seems to be clear that the lps equation , eq .",
    "( [ lps_phi ] ) can not be complete , since for the free electron the square root of the electron density is constant which implies that @xmath29 has to be zero , which is obviously not the case .",
    "a similar remedy was suggested earlier by wang and carter , see section vi.1 of @xcite .",
    "here , we extend their results and assume the most general wavefunction to be complex .",
    "the wavefunction contains two important features of the electron : amplitude and phase , generally @xmath113 writing the schrdinger equation with this wavefunction in the most general way ( we omit space and time dependencies for brevity ) , @xmath114\\psi= \\nonumber\\\\ \\hat h\\psi&=&\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 + v_{ext}+v_{h}+v_{gxc}\\right]\\psi\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] results in two equations for the real and imaginary parts , @xmath115 here , the most general @xmath90 is a complex potential . in a stationary state",
    "an eigenvalue equation applies , @xmath116\\psi=\\hat h\\psi=\\mu\\psi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which again results in two equations ( real and imaginary parts ) , @xmath117 eq .  ( [ time_dep_ri ] ) restricts the wavefunction to the simpler form , @xmath118 the first of eqs .",
    "( [ lps - modified ] ) is the modified lps equation where the phase function of the electron explicitly occurs modifying the kinetic energy of the electron system ( see next section ) .",
    "applying this equation to the free electron gives us the correct result for the total energy ( @xmath29 for @xmath79 electron ) : @xmath119 this modification accounts for the well known problem in orbital free methods , that the kinetic energy functionals of atomic systems , usually described by some modification of the von weizscker functional ( see above ) , or the kinetic energy functionals of free electron systems , like in many metals , are completely different .",

    "however , the general exchange correlation potential , @xmath90 , which is equal in magnitude but of opposite sign as the hartree potential , can not be explained from standard exchange and correlation effects for systems containing only one electron .",
    "an analysis with a more general kinetic operator including the effect of @xmath0 fields showed that the gxc - potential is due to an inertial field @xmath0 , related to electron motion , which leads to a lowering of total energy .",
    "the phase of free electron is also due to this inertial field , @xmath230 which has the same origin as the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "the inertial field @xmath0 was found to be equal to the momentum @xmath111 for the free electron .",
    "a system of @xmath1 free electrons will be determined in reciprocal space by a sphere of finite radius .",

    "the general problem can be formulated in terms of the local charge density distribution and the local complex vector field . from the results for a homogeneous electron gas we derived the solution for the vector field .",
    "this allowed to construct a local density approximation for the general problem , which is stated exclusively in terms of the density of charge , its derivatives , and auxiliary quantities inferred from a homogeneous electron gas .",
    "these results are quite unexpected .",
    "although it is probably too early to appreciate the full extent of these findings , some general points can be made .",
    "the existence of inertial fields @xmath0 , related to electron motion , seems to relate to the problem of finding transferable kinetic energy functionals in dft .",
    "if , as it seems , a crucial part of the physical picture has so far been omitted , then it is not surprising , that so far every formulation has been somewhat less than transferable .",
    "it is also important to note that the central result of the hohenberg - kohn theorem , i.e. the proof that the groundstate charge density minimizes the total energy , remains untouched by our findings .",

    "it may well be that the ultimate answer to the question , what spin actually is , will come from a closer analysis of the field under varying external conditions .",

    "this means , that no interactions exist between different regions of one extended electron . in principle , this allows for any size of electrons .    from a purely mathematical perspective , and in view of direct methods in density functional theory , the proof of a successful application to general condensed matter problems is still missing .",
    "given that the restrictions this relation imposes on the charge density distribution are much more stringent than in current models , and that any direct method is potentially much more efficient than a method based on solutions of the kohn - sham equations , the results seem promising .",
    "progress , in this respect , will depend on the development of transferable and precise parameterizations of the general exchange - correlation potential , or the vector field @xmath0 .",
    "a task , which has yet to be accomplished .    from a physical and more fundamental perspective , the emerging picture is quite intriguing . a quantum mechanical system , which finds its groundstate by equilibrating energy density throughout , is in principle not very different from a thermodynamic system of molecules , which accomplishes exactly the same on the level of molecular motion .",
    "there is thus no fundamental difference , if one goes from the analysis of isolated molecules to the analysis of electron charge .",
    "furthermore , it is quite difficult to explain to a layman , why an electron , as a point particle , does not immediately attach itself to the nucleus of a hydrogen atom .",
    "the present framework removes this problem , as well as the seeming contradiction , that extended electrons , with their inherent coulomb repulsion , are nevertheless stable .    however",
    ", here we should add a note of caution .",

    "<S> in this paper we revisit the levy - perdew - sahni equation . </S>",
    "<S> we establish that the relation implicitly contains the conservation of energy density at every point of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the separate contributions to the total energy density are described in detail , and it is shown that the key difference to standard density functional methods is the existence of a general exchange - correlation potential , which does not explicitly depend on electron charge . </S>",
    "<S> we derive solutions for the hydrogen - like atoms and analyse local properties . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that these systems are stable due to the existence of a vector potential @xmath0 , related to electron motion , which leads to two general effects : ( i ) the root of the charge density acquires an additional complex phase ; and ( ii ) for single electrons , the vector potential cancels the effect of electrostatic repulsions . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the density of states of a free electron gas based on this model and find that the vectorpotential also accounts for the pauli exclusion principle . </S>",
    "<S> implications of these results for direct methods in density functional theory are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that the omission of vector potentials in formulating the kinetic energy density functionals may be the main reason that direct methods so far are not generally applicable . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we provide an orbital free self - consistent formulation for determining the groundstate charge density in a local density approximation . </S>"
