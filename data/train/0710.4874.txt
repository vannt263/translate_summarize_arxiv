    "a well known formal difficulty of the standard model of particle physics is that the higgs boson mass has quadratically divergent contributions from fermion and gauge boson loops which must be cancelled by a ` fine - tuned ' tree - level mass term .",
    "this fine - tuning is removed in supersymmetric models by introducing boson partners for standard model fermions , and fermion partners for standard model bosons .",
    "cancellations of quadradic divergences then arise from the differing signs of bosonic and fermionic loops .",
    "recently a new class ` little higgs ' models@xcite , has emerged in which cancellations occur between paired particles of the _ same _ statistics : fermions are paired with new , massive fermions , and bosons with new massive bosons .    this little higgs mechanism , as realized in various models , requires a set of new massive gauge bosons , some of which mix with gauge bosons of the standard model . for some range of mixing angles the coupling of gauge bosons to scalars can become strong , resulting in a breakdown of perturbative calculation .",
    "in this work we probe the limits of perturbative reliability by examining the decay partial widths of a massive gauge boson .",
    "the prototype little higgs model is the ` littlest higgs'@xcite .",
    "here we study the decays of a new neutral @xmath3 gauge boson in the littlest higgs model , the @xmath0 .",
    "the presence and properties of this particle are central to the divergence - canceling mechanism of the littlest higgs model .",
    "a catalog of feynman rules for the littlest higgs model can be found in reference @xcite , along with a number of phenomenological results .",
    "a few important corrections can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "additional rules for scalar couplings can be found in reference @xcite . here",
    "we will sketch the outlines of the model as needed to establish notation and motivate our work .",
    "the enlarged electroweak space of the littlest higgs model is the symmetric tensor representation of @xmath6 , which is broken at a scale @xmath7 by a tensor vacuum expectation value to the coset @xmath8 .",
    "the result is @xmath9 goldstone bosons , which are parameterized by a @xmath10 non - linear sigma field @xmath11 .",
    "four of these goldstone bosons will become the complex higgs doublet of the standard model , four will become the longitudinal modes of four new massive gauge bosons , and the remaining six will form a massive complex scalar triplet .",
    "the @xmath6 group contains an @xmath12 subgroup , which is gauged , with gauge couplings @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the result is eight gauge bosons , which after diagonalization to mass eigenstates are the gauge bosons of the standard model , here labeled @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and new gauge bosons with masses of order @xmath7 , labeled @xmath18 , @xmath0 , @xmath19 .",
    "the mass diagonalization can be described in terms of the mixing angles :    @xmath20    and @xmath21    with @xmath6 represented in this way , quadratic higgs mass divergences from standard model gauge boson loops are cancelled by opposite - sign contributions from the new massive gauge bosons , leaving a logarithmic divergence . at some scale above @xmath22",
    "tev this logarithmic contribution must also be cancelled if fine - tuning is to be avoided , so we do not view the littlest higgs model as complete , but instead expect at sufficiently high energies additional contributions from an unidentified complete theory , the so - called  ultraviolet completion \"  @xcite .",

    "many of these decay processes are possible only for small or very large values of @xmath27 ( where @xmath0 becomes very massive ) due to the presence of one or more tev - scale particles in the final state .",

    "we exclude from our list processes without a quadrilinear coupling and with a related kinematically possible two - body decay , since these would constitute a double - counting of a two - body decay with an added decay step for one of the decay products .    the diagrams for the process @xmath1 are displayed in figure [ feynmans ] .",
    "note that a diagram with a @xmath31 particle propagator is not present because the combined effects of a factor of @xmath29 at each vertex places this diagram at higher order in the sigma expansion than we are working .",
    "since the calculation of a three - body decay is analytically difficult , especially because we wish to retain final state masses , we implemented a monte carlo integration to determine the partial width for @xmath1 .",
    "this partial width becomes very large at large and especially at small @xmath27 .",
    "we would expect this behavior because many vertex factors contain both @xmath27 and @xmath32 in the denominator .",
    "in fact this effect is present in two - body decays , but for three - body decays the width divergence is much more severe .",
    "the width - to - mass ratios for the processes @xmath2 and @xmath1 are shown in figure [ threep ] .",
    "the three - body partial width exceeds the two - body partial width for @xmath33 .",
    "this is clearly pathological , since three - body decays should be coupling - suppressed compared to two - body decays .",
    "what is happening ?",
    "the scalar - gauge boson couplings originate in the scalar kinematic lagrangian term@xcite :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the gauge - covariant derivative in the bifundamental representation of @xmath6 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the nonlinear representation : @xmath38 and where @xmath39 is a @xmath40 x @xmath40 matrix which parametrizes the scalars in the theory , including the longitudinal modes of massive standard model gauge bosons as well as the new tev scale gauge bosons . the constant matrix @xmath41 is the choice of vacuum expectation value for this model@xcite . in the gauge - covariant derivative",
    "the index @xmath42 is over the pairs of electroweak gauge groups , and the index over the generators of @xmath3 are suppressed .    as @xmath37",
    "is expanded in a power series , an infinite set of vertex factors will result from the scalar kinematic term , each involving two gauge bosons , some number of scalars and a power of @xmath43 , with the factor @xmath44 appearing due to mixing of the two @xmath3 gauge groups . the lowest order terms will be two gauge bosons plus one scalar , then plus two scalars , then three scalars , and so on .",
    "the existence of vertex factors connecting more than four external particles signals the fact that any nonlinear sigma model is a nonrenormalizable effective theory .",
    "the effects of this nonrenormalizability would become evident in loop calculations , but here we are considering a different kind of divergence - that of the expansion of the @xmath37 field itself .",
    "we might expect this divergence to become parametrically significant at about @xmath45 , which at @xmath25 tev occurs at @xmath46@xcite .",
    "instead , we see the pathological effect of the decay to @xmath47 exceeding the decay to @xmath48 at as high as @xmath49 , as we approach the strong coupling regime .    we have not presented the partial widths for other three - body processes , but can note that the decay @xmath50 should approximate that of @xmath47 due to the goldstone boson equivalence across these processes . with the exception of @xmath51 , all other processes will be kinematically suppressed due to the presence of one , two , or three tev - scale particles in the final state .",
    "these processes will in fact be kinematically excluded except for small or very large @xmath27 . by combining these contributions we can roughly estimate that the total partial width to three final state particles is less than an order of magnitude larger than that to @xmath47 for all but the smallest and largest values of @xmath27 .",
    "we have found that a characteristic three - body decay can become large at small and very large values of the @xmath3 mixing angle @xmath27 , and exceeds a related two - body decay at @xmath33 , indicating divergence of the sigma field expansion .",
    "the pathology of the littlest higgs model in this region of parameter space is due to a nonlinear sigma scalar field representation , and occurs over a larger regions of parameter space than a simple parametric calculation would suggest .",
    "although perturbative calculations break down in this region , we can note an interesting qualitative feature : the littest higgs model near the nonperturbative region would produce decays with high scalar multiplicities , especially with multiple higgs boson production , and so with large b quark multiplicities .",
    "this feature of large rates of scalar production in decays may be a general feature of nonlinear sigma fields near their perturbative limits , as the regime of strong dynamics is approached .",
    "in particular , we would expect similar results for decays of the littlest higgs @xmath18 and @xmath52 , and for the new gauge bosons of other models in the little higgs class , such as the simplest higgs @xmath53 .",
    "we should note , however , that all resuts presented here are at tree - level only , and could be significantly modified by the effects of loop corrections .",
    "we have presented the various expressions for two - body decays of the littlest higgs @xmath0 , including all final state masses .",
    "the numerical width - to - mass ratios for the most significant of these processes , and for a characteristic three - body decay process , confirm that the @xmath0 is a narrow resonance , as needed for dilepton invariant mass searches @xcite .",
