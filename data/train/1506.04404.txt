    "in the 1980 s , h.  komatsu ( @xcite-@xcite ) introduced a new class of hyperfunctions in one variable called laplace hyperfunctions in order to consider the laplace transform of a hyperfunction . by the theory of laplace hyperfunctions , he gave a new foundation of heaviside s theory on a wider class of functions .",
    "a laplace hyperfunction in one variable is defined by a difference of boundary values of holomorphic functions of exponential type along the real axis .",
    "recently , in the paper @xcite , the authors established a vanishing theorem of cohomology groups on a stein open subset with values in the sheaf of holomorphic functions of exponential type . as a consequence",
    ", we had succeeded in localizing the notion of one dimensional laplace hyperfunctions , that is , we constructed the sheaf of laplace hyperfunctions in one variable ( see .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the aim of our paper is to construct the sheaf of laplace hyperfunctions in several variables and study its fundamental properties . for that purpose , we establish an edge of the wedge type theorem for holomorphic functions of exponential type .",
    "namely , we show pure @xmath0-codimensionality of the partial radial compactification @xmath1 of @xmath2 relative to the sheaf @xmath3 of holomorphic functions of exponential type , and it is the most crucial step for construction of the sheaf @xmath4 of laplace hyperfunctions .",
    "this kind of a theorem , i.e. , an edge of the wedge theorem for holomorphic functions with bounds , was first established by t.  kawai in @xcite , where he had shown pure @xmath0-codimensionality of some compactification of @xmath5 for the sheaf of holomorphic functions with infra - exponential growth and then constructed the sheaf of fourier hyperfunctions .",
    "he had effectively used , in his proof , a duality theorem between complexes of locally convex topological vector spaces .",
    "after his success , the method employed there becomes very common and develops in showing pure codimensionality relative to several sheaves of holomorphic functions with bounds , see y.  saburi ( @xcite ) .",
    "the space of holomorphic functions of exponential type appearing in our study has also a locally convex topology of a vector space , which is defined by a projective limit of a sequence of dual frchet spaces .",
    "the morphisms in the sequence are , however , neither homomorphisms onto their images nor compact , and hence , the resulting topology of a vector space becomes very complicated like the one for the space of real analytic functions on an open subset in @xmath5 .",
    "therefore we can not apply the topological method mentioned above directly to the case studied in our paper . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we adopt an algebraic method based on a martineau type theorem ( theorem [ martineau ] ) and obtain the result after some algebraic computations . at the same time",
    ", we also show pure @xmath0-codimensionality of the boundary @xmath6 of the radial compactification relative to @xmath3 , from which two important properties of @xmath4 follow : softness of the sheaf @xmath4 and extendability of a usual hyperfunction to a laplace hyperfunction .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section @xmath7 , we shortly review the vanishing theorem of cohomology groups on a stein open subset with values in @xmath3 , which was given in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "we first recall , for an @xmath0-dimensional @xmath8-vector space @xmath9 and a complex linear space @xmath10 of holomorphic parameters , the definitions of the partial radial compactification @xmath11 of @xmath12 and the sheaf @xmath3 of holomorphic functions of exponential type on @xmath13 .",
    "since pseudo - convexity is insufficient to guarantee vanishing of higher cohomology groups as example [ eg ] shows , to obtain the vanishing theorem , we introduce the notion of the regularity condition at infinity for an open subset in @xmath13 .",
    "then we give the vanishing theorem of cohomology groups and some related results .",
    "the main purpose of section @xmath14 is to establish an edge of the wedge theorem for @xmath3 . before showing the main theorem",
    ", we prepare several vanishing theorems of cohomology groups with values in @xmath3 .",
    "we first show a martineau type theorem for @xmath3 which is a key of the proof for the edge of the wedge theorem .",
    "then , for an @xmath0-dimensional @xmath15-vector space @xmath16 , we show the edge of the wedge theorem along @xmath17 for @xmath3 and pure @xmath0-codimensionality of the boundary @xmath18 relative to @xmath3 .    in section @xmath19",
    ", we define the sheaf of laplace hyperfunctions with holomorphic parameters and study its fundamental properties , especially , we show that any hyperfunction can be extended to a laplace hyperfunction .",
    "we also give the canonical embedding from the sheaf of real analytic functions of exponential type to the one of laplace hyperfunctions .",
    "softness of the sheaf of laplace hyperfunctions is shown in the last section .    at the end of the introduction ,",
    "the authors are grateful to professor hikosaburo komatsu for the valuable lectures and advises .",
    "the aim of this section is to review the vanishing theorem of cohomology groups on a stein open subset with coefficients in holomorphic functions of exponential type . for the details we refer the reader to @xcite .",
