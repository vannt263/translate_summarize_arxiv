    "in this report we address the exciting physics that could be accomplished at muon colliders in the context of the central physics issue of our time : how is the electroweak symmetry broken , weakly or strongly ?",
    "higgs bosons and a low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) are the particles of interest in the weakly broken scenario and new resonances at the tev scale of a new strong interaction dynamics are the alternatives .",
    "muon colliders would have decided advantages over other machines in providing ( i )  sharp beam energy for precision measurements of masses , widths and couplings of the higgs , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and supersymmetry particles , and ( ii )  high energy / high luminosity for production of high mass particles and studies of a strongly interacting electroweak sector ( sews ) .    in order to be able to do interesting physics at a muon collider ,",
    "the minimum luminosity requirement is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the cross section for the process @xmath14 , @xmath15 the prototype designs under consideration well exceed the figure of merit in ( [ eq : minlum ] ) .",
    "*   + @xmath16 *   + @xmath17    special purpose rings may be added to these designs at modest cost , to optimize luminosities at specific energies for study of @xmath6-channel resonances and thresholds .",
    "muon colliders offer several unique and highly advantageous features .",
    "first , @xmath6-channel higgs boson production occurs at interesting rates .",
    "the higgs coupling is proportional to the mass , so this process is highly suppressed at @xmath18 and @xmath19 colliders .",
    "second , a fine energy resolution is an intrinsic property of muon colliders .",
    "a beam energy resolution @xmath20 to 0.08% is natural and a resolution down to @xmath21 is realizable@xcite . by comparison , @xmath22 is expected at an @xmath18 machine .",
    "the root mean square spread in center - of - mass energy @xmath23 is given in terms of @xmath24 by @xmath25 the monochromicity of the c.m .",
    "energy is _ vital _ for @xmath6-channel higgs studies and _ valuable _ for threshold measurements .",
    "furthermore , for mass measurements a c.m .",
    "calibration can be obtained of mev accuracy , and the necessary energy calibration @xmath26 may be achieved with spin rotation measurements of polarized muons in the ring . a final , but no less significant aspect of muon colliders ,",
    "is that their c.m .",
    "energy reach is extendable into the @xmath27  tev range where new physics is expected ( either susy or sews ) .",
    "precision measurements of @xmath28 and @xmath29 can provide important constraints on the higgs mass in the sm , or other new physics beyond the sm , through the relation @xmath30 ^{1/2 } \\,,\\ ] ] where the loop contributions @xmath31 depend on @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the sm and also on sparticle masses in supersymmetry .",
    "the optimal relative precision of @xmath28 and @xmath29 measurements is @xmath34 for example @xmath35  mev for @xmath36  mev .",
    "there is excellent potential to make very precise @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath38 measurements at the fmc because of the sharp beam energy , the suppression of initial state radiation and the absence of significant beamstrahlung . with 100  fb@xmath39 luminosity just above the @xmath8 threshold ( @xmath40  gev )",
    "a @xmath28 precision @xmath41 is attainable . with 100  fb@xmath39 devoted to a 10 point scan ( @xmath42  gev ) over the @xmath37 threshold",
    ", the top quark mass could be measured to an accuracy @xmath43 then , with improved determinations of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , such @xmath28 and @xmath29 measurements would constrain the sm higgs to a precision @xmath47 ( e.g.  @xmath48  gev ) .",
    "the limiting factor on @xmath49 is the uncertainty on @xmath28 .",
    "correspondingly tight constraints would be placed on other new physics .",
    "the shape of the @xmath37 threshold also constrains @xmath50 , the top quark width @xmath51 , and possibly also @xmath38 ( via @xmath52-exchange contributions ) .      in the minimal standard model ( mssm ) , the parameters of the higgs sector are @xmath53 at tree level , and also the top - quark and stop masses and stop mixing at the loop level .",
    "the light higgs boson is the only supersymmetric particle with an iron - clad upper bound , which is@xcite @xmath54 thus it is the first target for experimental searches .",
    "a light higgs boson will be produced at a lepton collider via the @xmath55-bremsstrahlung process @xmath56 with high resolution energy measurements the recoil mass and @xmath52-mass reconstruction give high precision @xmath38 . with 50  fb@xmath39 luminosity at a @xmath57  gev @xmath18 collider ,",
    "the following precisions are anticipated @xmath58 a threshold measurement of the @xmath2 production cross section provides a new approach to precisely determine @xmath38 .",
    "figure  1 shows the predicted energy dependence of the cross section .",
    "the @xmath59 background is very small , except in the case when @xmath60 .",
    "a measurement with 100  fb@xmath39 luminosity at @xmath61  gev of the cross section at a muon collider would yield a sm higgs mass to within @xmath62 for @xmath63  gev .",
    "a unique capability of a muon collider is the production of a higgs resonance in the @xmath6-channel , @xmath64 .",
    "the light quark background can be rejected by @xmath65-tagging .",
    "the resonance cross section is @xmath66 one needs to tune the higgs energy to @xmath67 by an energy scan in the vicinity of @xmath38 .",
    "the signal is enhanced with polarized beams if the luminosity decrease with polarization@xcite is less than @xmath68 which is 10 for @xmath69 .",
    "the higgs resonance profile depends on the total higgs width , @xmath70 , which is highly model dependent .",
    "figure  2 shows expectations for @xmath70 in the sm and the mssm .",
    "a light ( @xmath71  gev ) sm higgs has a relatively narrow width , @xmath72few mev .",
    "the width of the light higgs in the mssm is larger than that of the sm higgs and scales up roughly with @xmath73 .",
    "figure  3 shows the light higgs resonance profile for the sm higgs and the mssm higgs at @xmath74 and 20 , for resolutions @xmath21 , 0.06% and 0.1% . for a resolution @xmath75 ,",
    "the breit - wigner line shape can be measured and @xmath70 determined . to be sensitive to @xmath70 of a few mev , a resolution @xmath21 is needed .",
    "= 3.8 in      an energy scan can be made for a @xmath6-channel higgs resonance in the mass range 63  gev@xmath76 . for detection",
    "we require a significance @xmath77 and assume excellent resolution @xmath21 ( @xmath78  mev ) to assure sensitivity to the narrow width of a sm higgs .",
    "the necessary luminosity per scan point for representative @xmath38 values is @xmath79 the number of scan points needed to zero in on @xmath80 within 1  rms spread @xmath78  mev is @xmath81 where the right - hand column is the assumed prior knowledge on @xmath82 .",
    "once a rough scan has determined the higgs mass to an accuracy @xmath83 a three - point fine scan can pinpoint the higgs mass to still higher precision .",
    "for this , the optimal distribution of luminosity is @xmath84 on the peak location found in the rough scan and @xmath85 on each of the resonance wings at @xmath86 from the peak .",
    "the measurement of @xmath87 improves the @xmath38 precision and measures @xmath70 . as an illustration we consider @xmath88  gev for which @xmath89  mev",
    ". then with a total luminosity @xmath90  fb@xmath39 and a resolution @xmath21 , a fine scan would yield @xmath91 which is a 30% measurement of the sm higgs width .",
    "after the higgs discovery , the next burning question is whether it is the sm higgs or the mssm higgs boson .",
    "there are two ways to know .",
    "the first way is to measure @xmath70 and @xmath94 .",
    "the couplings of the mssm higgs to @xmath95 and @xmath96 are substantially greater than the sm higgs coupling to a heavy mssm higgs mass of @xmath97  gev .",
    "the two scenarios are thereby distinguishable at the @xmath98 level with @xmath99  fb@xmath39 and @xmath21 , except for @xmath38 near @xmath100 .",
    "the second way is to find the other heavier mssm higgs bosons . at the lhc",
    "there are some regions of @xmath101 vs.  @xmath102 where only the lightest mssm higgs boson can be discovered . in the larger @xmath102 limit of many supergravity models , the masses of @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and",
    "@xmath105 are approximately degenerate and @xmath52 looks increasingly like @xmath93 in its properties .",
    "there are 3 possible @xmath106 search techniques at muon colliders :    1 .    + with @xmath107  fb@xmath39 the @xmath106 discovery prospects are robust for @xmath108 and @xmath109 . overlapping @xmath110",
    "resonances can be separated by the scan ; see fig .",
    "the @xmath110 widths ( @xmath111 to 0.6  gev ) are larger than resolution and can be measured by the scan .",
    "when the muon collider is run at full energy , @xmath6-channel production of @xmath106 will result from the luminosity in the bremsstrahlung tail ; see fig .",
    "this production is competitive with the scan search for @xmath1127 and invariant mass resolution @xmath113  gev .",
    "3 .    + at the nmc ( 4  tev )",
    "the discovery a very heavy higgs boson is feasible via the the processes @xmath114 .",
    "cross sections are illustrated in fig .",
    "once discovery is made , special storage rings can be constructed with c.m .",
    "energy @xmath115 to measure the higgs widths and partial widths",
    ".    note that at the nmc the large event rates for production of the light higgs boson may allow measurement of rare decay modes there , e.g.  @xmath116 .",
    "a compelling case for building a 4  tev nmc exists for both the weakly or strongly interacting electroweak symmetry breaking scenarios .",
    "supersymmetry has many scalar particles ( sleptons , squarks , higgs bosons ) .",
    "some or possibly many of these scalars may have tev - scale masses . since spin-0 pair production is @xmath117-wave suppressed at lepton colliders , energies well above the thresholds are _ necessary _ for sufficient production rates ; see fig .",
    "7 . moreover , the single production mechanisms at lepton colliders and the excellent initial state energy resolution are _ advantageous _ in reconstructing sparticle mass spectra from their complex cascade decays .",
    "if no higgs boson exists with @xmath118  gev , then partial wave unitarity of @xmath119 scattering requires that the scattering be strong at the 12  tev energy scale .",
    "the @xmath119 scattering amplitude is @xmath120 then new physics must be manifest at high energies .",
    "energy reach is a critical matter here with subprocess energies @xmath121  tev needed to probe strong @xmath8 scattering . since @xmath122 , this condition implies @xmath123 thus the nmc would have sufficient energy for study of the sews .",
    "the nature of the underlying physics will be revealed by the study of all possible vector boson ",
    "vector boson scattering channels , since the sizes of the signals depend on the resonant or non - resonant interactions in the different isospin channels ; see table  1 .",
