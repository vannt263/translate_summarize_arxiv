    "we review some recent results in the study of glasses and dense granular materials obtained with the aid of schematic lattice models , simple enough to allow a full numerical and analytical investigation .",
    "glasses and granular media exhibit deep similarities in their `` jamming '' behaviors , but although the idea of a unified description is emerging ( see silbert , ohern , liu and nagel contribution to this volume ) , the precise nature of jamming in non - thermal systems , such as granular media , and the origin of its close connections to glassy phenomena in thermal ones are still open and very important issues .    an important conceptual open problem concerning granular media , is the absence of an established theoretical framework where they might be described .",
    "edwards @xcite ( see edwards , bruji , and makse contribution to this volume ) proposed a solution to such a problem by introducing the hypothesis that time averages of a system , exploring its mechanically stable states subject to some external drive ( e.g. , `` tapping '' ) , coincide with suitable ensemble averages over its `` jammed states '' .",
    "we discuss here some recent results validating and generalizing edwards proposal ( see also dean and lefevre , and tarjus and viot contributions ) . in particular , within this approach we show that mean field models for granular media undergo a phase transition from a ( supercooled ) `` fluid '' phase to a `` glassy '' phase , when their crystallization transition is avoided .",
    "the nature of such a `` glassy '' phase results to be the same found in mean field models for glass formers : a discontinuous one step replica symmetry breaking phase preceded by a dynamical freezing point .",
    "these results are supported by monte carlo ( mc ) `` tap dynamics '' simulations which , in the region of low mc shaking amplitudes , show a pronounced jamming similar to the one found in experiments on granular media ( see bideau , philippe , ribire and richard , and caballero , lindner , ovarlez , reydellet , lanuza and clement , and danna and mayor contributions to the volume ) . as an application of edwards approach to powders",
    "we also briefly discuss segregation / mixing phenomena in these systems and discuss close correspondences with experiments ( see reis , mullin and ehrhardt contribution ) .",
    "sec.[granular ] gives an short introduction to the phenomenology of granular materials relevant to the present purpose .",
    "sec.[sam ] briefly reviews the essential lines in edwards statistical mechanics of powders and discuss some correspondence with other systems `` frozen '' at @xmath0 , such as glasses in their inherent structures . in sections [ mgm ] to [ twotemp ] we describe our results obtained in the study of hard spheres lattice models of granular materials , in order to check and apply edwards statistical mechanics to jamming and segregation .",
    "these are obtained by computer simulations and by analytic calculations with the generalized bethe - peierls method , or `` cavity method '' , recently developed by mzard and parisi @xcite .",
    "finally , we draw some conclusions .",
    "granular media are large conglomerations of discrete macroscopic particles .",
    "ubiquitous in the world around us , in many respect they behave differently from any of the other familiar forms of matter - solids , liquids , or gases ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the static and dynamic properties of granular media , which are strongly dissipative systems , are not affected by temperature , because thermal fluctuations are usually negligible . in sand",
    "the potential energy of a grain raised a distance equal to its own diameter can be @xmath1 times @xmath2 at room temperature ; therefore the temperature of the external bath can be considered zero and these media called _ non - thermal_. as the system can not explore its phase space , unless perturbed by external forces ( such as shaking or tapping ) , it is frozen , at rest , in its mechanically stable microstates .",
    "even though granular media may form crystalline packings , in most cases they are found at rest in disordered configurations , characterized by `` fluid '' like distribution functions .",
    "actually , gently shaken granular media exhibit a strong form of `` jamming '' @xcite , i.e. , an exceedingly slow dynamics , which shows deep connections to `` freezing '' phenomena observed in many thermal systems such as glass formers @xcite .",
    "it was discovered by the chicago group @xcite that under tapping the density of granular media tends to increase very slowly as a function of the number of shakes , in a stretched exponential @xcite or even logarithmic @xcite way .",
    "these systems have typical `` aging phenomena '' along with huge relaxation times diverging  la arrhenius or vogel and fulcher @xcite , similarly to glass formers in the freezing region .    here",
    ", we discuss the nature of jamming in non - thermal systems @xcite , and the origin of its close connections to glassy phenomena in thermal ones , in the framework of the statistical mechanics of powders introduced by edwards @xcite : we derive the phase diagram of granular media and explain in a quantitative way their similarities and differences with glass formers .",
    "the introduction of a statistical mechanics for powders is grounded on observations from experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite that , as much as in thermal systems , their macroscopic properties at stationarity are characterized by a few control parameters and their macrostates correspond to a huge number of microstates .    as an application of the statistical mechanics of powders",
    ", we also consider the intriguing phenomenon of segregation : in presence of shaking a granular system is not randomized , but its components tend to separate @xcite .",
    "an example is the so called `` brazil nut '' effect ( bne ) where , under shaking , large particles rise to the top and small particles move to the bottom of the container .",
    "interestingly , by changing grains sizes or mass ratio or shaking amplitudes a crossover towards a `` reverse brazil nut '' effect ( rbne ) was more recently discovered @xcite where small particles segregates to the top and large particles to the bottom .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these phenomena which , although of deep practical and conceptual relevance , are still largely unknown@xcite . geometric effects , such as `` percolation '' @xcite or `` reorganization '' @xcite , are known to be at work since , in a nutshell , small grains appear to filter beneath large ones .",
    "`` dynamical '' effects , such as convection @xcite or inertia @xcite , were shown to play a role as well .",
    "recent simulations and experiments have , however , outlined that segregation phenomena can involve `` global '' mechanisms , such as `` condensation '' @xcite or , more generally , `` phase separation '' @xcite .",
    "we focus on these properties here .",
    "in the statistical mechanics of powders introduced by edwards @xcite it is postulated that the system at rest ( i.e. , not in the `` fluidized '' regime ) can be described by suitable ensemble averages over its `` mechanically stable '' states ( called here `` inherent states '' ) .",
    "edwards proposed a method to individuate the probability , @xmath3 , to find the system in its inherent state @xmath4 , under the assumption that these mechanically stable states have the same a priori probability to occur .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath3 has the conceptual advantage to substitute _ time _ with _ ensemble averages _ , allowing the description of the system properties by use of few basic theoretical concepts , as in thermodynamics . a possible approach to find @xmath3 is as follows @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 is obtained as the maximum of the entropy , @xmath5 with the macroscopic constraint , in the case of the canonical ensemble , that the system energy , @xmath6 , is given .",
    "this assumption leads to the gibbs result : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a _ lagrange multiplier _ , called _ inverse configurational temperature _ , enforcing the above constraint on the energy : @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the number of inherent states with energy @xmath11 .",
    "thus , summarizing , the system at rest has @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "these basic considerations , to be validated by experiments or simulations , settle a theoretical statistical mechanics framework to describe granular media .",
    "consider , for definiteness , a system of monodisperse hard spheres of mass @xmath14 . in the system whole configuration space @xmath15 , we can write edwards generalized partition function as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the hard core interaction between grains , @xmath18 is the gravity contribution to the energy ( @xmath19 is particles height ) , and the factor @xmath20 is a projector on the space of `` mechanically stable '' states ( i.e. , inherent states space ) @xmath21 : if @xmath22 then @xmath23 else @xmath24 .",
    "usual statistical mechanics , where @xmath25 is identified with @xmath26 , is recovered in the case where @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "in order to test edwards proposal one introduces a dynamics ( such as `` trapping '' ) that allows the system to explore the inherent states space .",
    "using this dynamics one has first to check that at stationarity the system properties do not depend on the details of the dynamical history , i.e. , a `` thermodynamic '' description is indeed possible .",
    "then one must check that time averages obtained using such a dynamics compare well with ensemble averages over the distribution eq.([pr ] ) .",
    "edwards approach could also be relevant for a supercooled liquid quenched at very low temperature ( about zero ) .",
    "in this case the system remains blocked in its `` inherent structures '' , i.e. , the local minima of the potential energy in the particle configuration space @xcite ( by analogy with the glass terminology we call `` inherent states '' the mechanically stable states in granular materials ) .    in glasses , in the inherent structure approach @xcite ,",
    "the configurational entropy ( and consequently the configurational temperature ) associated to the number of inherent structures corresponding to a given energy , @xmath11 , can be defined too . in this context",
    "two different ways were essentially used to allow the system explore its inherent structure space .",
    "one way is by quenching the system over and over from an equilibrium temperature , @xmath29 , to zero temperature @xcite . using this procedure , sciortino _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found that the configurational temperature numerically coincides with the equilibrium temperature @xmath29 , provided that @xmath29 is low enough .",
    "another way to visit the inherent structures is by letting the system aging in contact with an almost zero bath temperature , @xmath26 . during the aging process",
    "an effective temperature , @xmath30 , can be defined via the off - equilibrium extension of the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xcite .",
    "it happens that in mean field models @xcite this effective temperature coincides with the configurational temperature , @xmath31 .",
    "this was also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the limit @xmath32 , for a class of finite dimensional systems .",
    "the connection between edwards approach for granular media and the results in glass theory has been pointed out in @xcite .",
    "a second procedure , called `` tap dynamics '' , similar to that used in the compaction of real granular materials was instead used in @xcite . in particular in ref . @xcite",
    "each tap consists in raising the bath temperature to a value @xmath33 and , after a lapse of time @xmath34 , quenching it back to zero . by cyclically repeating the process",
    "the system explores the space of the inherent states .",
    "once the stationary state is reached a temperature , @xmath35 , is defined via the equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation , and if edwards assumption applies , @xmath35 coincides with the configurational temperature .",
    "this was verified for different finite dimensional models @xcite .",
    "many other studies discussing edwards approach in this perspective were also presented @xcite . in the following sections we give a picture of results @xcite about such a statistical mechanics approach in schematic models of granular media and glasses .",
    "our lattice models for granular media are subject to a monte carlo dynamics made of `` taps '' sequences .",
    "a `` tap '' is a period of time , of length @xmath34 ( the tap duration ) , during which the system evolves at a finite bath temperature @xmath36 ( the tap amplitude ) ; after each `` tap '' the system evolves at @xmath37 and reaches an inherent state . ]",
    "the simplest model for granular media we considered @xcite is a system of hard - spheres of equal diameter @xmath38 , subjected to gravity .",
    "we have studied this model on a lattice , constraining the centers of mass of the spheres on the sites of a cubic lattice ( see inset in fig .  [ universal ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is : @xmath39 where the height of site @xmath40 is @xmath41 , @xmath42 is gravity acceleration , @xmath43 the grains mass , @xmath44 the usual occupancy variable ( i.e. , @xmath45 or @xmath46 if site @xmath40 is empty of filled by a grain ) and @xmath47 an hard - core interaction term that prevents the overlapping of nearest neighbor grains ( this term can be written as @xmath48 , where the limit @xmath49 is taken ) .",
    "the grains are subject to a dynamics made of a sequence of monte carlo `` taps '' ( see fig .",
    "[ tap ] ) : a single `` tap '' is a period of time , of length @xmath34 ( the tap duration ) , where particles can diffuse laterally , upwards with probability @xmath50 $ ] , and downwards with probability @xmath51 .",
    "when the `` tap '' is off grains can only move downwards ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) and the system evolves with @xmath52 until it reaches a blocked configuration ( i.e. , an `` inherent state '' ) where no grain can move downwards without violating the hard core repulsion .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 has an effect equivalent to keep the system in contact ( for a time @xmath34 ) with a bath temperature @xmath54 $ ] ( called the `` tap amplitude '' ) .",
    "the properties of the system are measured when this is in a blocked state .",
    "time averages , therefore , are averages over the blocked configurations reached with this dynamics .",
    "time @xmath55 is measured as the number of taps applied to the system .",
    "under such a tap dynamics the systems reaches a stationary state where the statistical mechanics approach to granular media can be tested , and particularly edwards hypothesis can be verified by comparing time averages to ensemble averages of eq.([pr ] ) .      during the tap dynamics , in the stationary state , the time average of the energy , @xmath56 , and its fluctuations , @xmath57 ,",
    "are calculated .",
    "cc    &    figure [ energy ] shows @xmath58 ( main frame ) and @xmath59 ( inset ) as function the tap amplitude , @xmath36 , ( for several values of the tap duration , @xmath34 ) .",
    "since sequences of taps , with same @xmath33 and different @xmath34 , give different values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , it is apparent that @xmath33 is not the right thermodynamic parameter . on the other hand , if the stationary states are indeed characterized by a _",
    "thermodynamic parameter the curves corresponding to different tap sequences ( i.e. different @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) should collapse onto a single master function , when @xmath59 is parametrically plotted as function of @xmath60 .",
    "this is the case in the present model , where the data collapse is in fact found and shown in fig .",
    "[ universal ] .",
    "this is a prediction that could be easily checked in real granular materials .",
    "a technique to derive from raw data the thermodynamic parameter @xmath61 conjugated to @xmath11 ( apart from an integration constant , @xmath62 ) , is through the usual _ equilibrium _ fluctuation - dissipation relation : @xmath63 by integrating eq.([sb ] ) , @xmath64 can be expressed as function of @xmath60 or ( for a fixed value of @xmath34 ) as function of @xmath65 : @xmath66 ( the constant @xmath62 can be determined as explained in @xcite ) .",
    "cc    &      in sect .",
    "[ tapping ] we have found that the fluctuations of the energy in the stationary state depend only on the energy , @xmath11 , and not on the past history . more generally , we found @xcite that all the macroscopic quantities we observed depend only on the energy , @xmath11 , or on its conjugate thermodynamic parameter , @xmath61 , thus the stationary state can be genuinely considered a `` thermodynamic state '' . in this case",
    "one can attempt to construct an equilibrium statistical mechanics , as originally suggested by edwards @xcite .    to test edward",
    "hypothesis one has to compare the time average of the energy , @xmath67 , recorded during the taps sequences , with the ensemble average , @xmath68 , over the distribution eq.([pr ] ) .",
    "therefore we have independently calculated the ensemble average @xmath69 , as function of @xmath8 .",
    "[ edwards ] ( see also fig . [ universal ] ) shows a very good agreement between @xmath70 and @xmath67 ( notice that there are no adjustable parameters ) . in order to check the scenario in further details ,",
    "we have also calculated the system density on the bottom layer , @xmath71 , and the density self - overlap function @xmath72 : @xmath73 , where the sum is over all the lattice sites and @xmath74 and @xmath75 refer to two different copies of the systems , which are at stationarity under the same tap dynamics .",
    "we have verified that , when plotted as function of @xmath35 , both @xmath71 and @xmath72 scale on a single master function ( see fig .",
    "[ mimmo ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ hard_sph ] ( inset ) we also show the dependence of the configurational temperature @xmath31 on the parameters of the tap dynamics @xmath36 and @xmath34 .",
    "finally , we mention that we have also successfully tested edwards scenario in an other model , the `` frustrated lattice gas '' @xcite , a system in the category of spin glasses .",
    "the mc tap dynamics , in both the `` frustrated lattice gas '' and hard sphere models , exhibits a rich structure in agreement with experimental findings @xcite . in the region of small tap amplitudes ,",
    "the system gets `` jammed '' and `` memory '' phenomena are observed , along with `` irreversibility '' effects @xcite . in particular",

    "asymptotically @xmath80 can be well fitted by stretched exponentials : @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "the exponent @xmath82 becomes significantly lower than 1 at low amplitudes .",
    "the above fit defines the relaxation time @xmath83:the growth of @xmath84 by decreasing @xmath33 is well approximated by an arrhenius or vogel - tamman - fulcher law ( as early found in @xcite ) , resembling the slowing down of glass formers close to the glass transition , a result also recently experimentally reported in granular media @xcite : @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "the divergence point , @xmath86 ( which in simulations is difficult to precisely locate ; here it is between @xmath87 and @xmath46 ) , of @xmath84 is interpreted as the numerical location of the point of dynamical arrest of the system , where an `` ideal '' transition to a glassy phase occurs . by quenching the system at low values of @xmath36 ,",
    "the tti character of relaxation is lost and logarithmic aging behaviors are found . for slow quenches the hard spheres model is able , anyway , to attain its crystal phase .",
    "the precise nature of the `` glassy '' region is , however , very difficult to be numerically determined , so in the next section an analytic approach is presented .",
    "an other dynamical quantity of interest is grains mean square displacement , @xmath88 , defining for @xmath89 the diffusion coefficient @xmath90 .",
    "as much as in glass formers , @xmath91 goes to zero around a high density @xmath92 , signaling a localization transition in which particles are confined in local cages and the macroscopic diffusion - like processes are suppressed @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon may also be described in a different way : @xmath92 is the density above which it becomes impossible to obtain a macroscopic rearrangement of particles positions without increasing the system volume , i.e. , the density at which macroscopic shear in the system is impossible without dilatancy .",
    "this remark outlines the close correspondence with the phenomenon of the reynolds transition in granular media @xcite .",
    "we have discussed up to here schematic models for granular media shown to be well described by edwards assumption . since the exact calculation of edwards partition function , @xmath93 , for the above model of monodisperse hard spheres on a cubic lattice is hardly feasible",
    ", we now discuss a mean field theory @xcite . in an approximation",
    " la bethe - peierls , we consider a random graph version of such a lattice , sketched in fig . [ blattice ] : more specifically we consider a 3d lattice box with @xmath19 horizontal layers ( i.e. , @xmath94 ) occupied by hard spheres ; each layer is a random graph of given connectivity , @xmath95 ( we take @xmath96 ) ; each site in layer @xmath97 is also connected to its homologous site in @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( the total connectivity is thus @xmath100 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is the one of eq.([hhs ] ) plus a chemical potential term to control the overall density .",
    "hard core repulsion prevents two connected sites to be occupied at the same time . in the present lattice model",
    "we adopt a simple definition of `` mechanical stability '' : a grain is `` stable '' if it has a grain underneath .",
    "the operator @xmath20 has thus a simple expression : @xmath101 where @xmath102 ( for clarity , we have shown the @xmath97 dependence in @xmath103 ) .    by using the `` cavity method '' @xcite , the phase diagram",

    "this collapse of data is not observed here , as it is apparent in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_dh ] .",
    "we found , instead , @xcite that two macroscopic quantities can be sufficient to characterize uniquely the stationary state of the system .",

    "<S> _ in the framework of schematic hard spheres lattice models we discuss edwards statistical mechanics approach to granular media . </S>",
    "<S> as this approach appears to hold here to a very good approximation , by analytical calculations of edwards partition function at a mean field level we derive the system phase diagram and show that `` jamming '' corresponds to a phase transition from a `` fluid '' to a `` glassy '' phase , observed when crystallization is avoided . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of such a `` glassy '' phase turns out to be the same found in mean field models for glass formers . in the same context </S>",
    "<S> , we also briefly discuss mixing / segregation phenomena of binary mixtures : the presence of fluid - crystal phase transitions drives segregation as a form of phase separation and , within a given phase , gravity can also induce a kind of `` vertical '' segregation , usually not associated to phase transitions . _ </S>"
