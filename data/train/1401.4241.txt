    "losses are a ubiquitous feature appearing in all kinds of optical systems . in most cases ,",
    "losses are considered as a detrimental feature , which must be compensated by a properly introduced gain or feeding beam , in internally and externally driven systems , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , losses may play a positive role too , helping to stabilize modes which otherwise would not exist .",
    "an example is a possibility to stabilize dissipative solitons in models of laser cavities which are described by complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equations .",
    "the simplest version of the cgl equation with the spatially uniform linear gain and cubic loss gives rise to exact solutions in the form of chirped sech pulses @xcite , but they are unstable , as the linear gain destabilizes the zero background around the solitons . a possibility to stabilize the solitons",
    "was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , making use of dual - core couplers , with the linear gain acting in one core , and linear loss  in the other . in that system ,",
    "the stable pulse exists , as an _ attractor _ , along with an unstable counterpart of a smaller amplitude , which plays the role of a separatrix between attraction basins of the stable pulse and stable zero solution .",
    "the use of similar settings for the generation of stable plasmonic solitons @xcite , and for the creation of stable two - dimensional dissipative solitons and vortices in laser systems with the feedback described by the linearly coupled stabilizing equation @xcite , have been proposed too .    in this connection , it is relevant to stress a crucial difference between dissipative solitons , which are found , in particular , in the linearly - coupled systems with the separated gain and loss @xcite , and solitons in conservative media .",
    "stable dissipative solitons exist as isolated attractors , selected as modes which provide for the balance between gain and loss in the system @xcite . on the contrary , in conservative settings , including various models of nonlinear optics @xcite , solitons exist in continuous families , rather than as isolated solutions .",
    "more recently , a special class of dissipative systems was identified , with exactly balanced spatially separated ( antisymmetrically set ) dissipative and amplifying elements .",
    "such systems realize the concept of the @xmath1 ( parity - time ) symmetry .",
    "this concept was originally elaborated in the quantum theory @xcite for settings described by non - hermitian hamiltonians , which contain spatially even and odd real and imaginary potentials , respectively .",
    "a distinctive feature of the hamiltonians with complex @xmath1-symmetric potentials is the fact that , up to a certain critical value of the strength of the imaginary ( dissipative ) part , their spectrum remains purely real .",
    "actually , such @xmath1-symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonians ( of linear systems ) can be transformed into hermitian ones @xcite .    in terms of the quantum theory ,",
    "the @xmath1-symmetry is a theoretical possibility . to implement it in real settings ,",
    "it is natural to resort to the fact that the linear propagation equation for optical beams in the paraxial approximation has essentially the same form as the schrdinger equation in quantum mechanics , hence the evolution of the wave function of a quantum particle may be emulated by the transmission of an optical beam .",
    "this fact makes it possible to simulate many quantum - mechanical phenomena , some of which are difficult to observe in direct experiments , by means of relatively simple settings available in classical optics @xcite .    the realization of the @xmath1-symmetric settings in optics , which combines spatially symmetric refractive - index landscapes and mutually balanced spatially separated gain and loss , was proposed in ref .",

    "a better agreement with the perturbation theory may be expected for a smoother shape of the @xmath151 dipole [ see eq .",
    "( [ deltas ] ) ] , but in that case the analytical results take a more cumbersome form , due to the complexity of the respective integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , ( [ dp / dz ] ) , and ( [ dv / dz ] ) .",
    "generally , the fact that the discrepancy between the numerical and analytical results in fig .",
    "[ bs3 ] is smaller for @xmath155 is explained by the fact that the larger amplitude of the pumped , rather than attenuated , soliton in this case ( see above ) makes the local perturbation weaker in comparison with other terms in eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) .",
    "to consider the interaction of dark solitons with the @xmath1 dipole , we fix the cw - background amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ dark ] ) as @xmath161 . in the absence of dark solitons , the cw background , @xmath162 ,",
    "is deformed by the potential @xcite . as shown above , in the limit of @xmath39 and ideal @xmath12 function in eq .",
    "( [ dark ] ) , the deformation amounts to the phase jump ( [ shift ] ) at @xmath29 .    in fig .  [",
    "bg](a ) , we plot the shape of the background obtained in the numerical form , with the @xmath12 function in eq .",
    "( [ dark ] ) replaced by regularization  ( [ deltas ] ) ] , for @xmath144 and @xmath163 .",
    "similarly to the previous works , we find that this ground state , produced by the stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ dark ] ) , exists at @xmath164 ( at @xmath14 exceeding this critical value , the system starts spontaneous generation of dark solitons @xcite ) .",
    "the difference of the background from the above - mentioned analytical solution , which amounts to the phase jump ( [ jump ] ) embedded into the constant background , is explained by the difference of approximation ( deltas ) from the ideal @xmath12 function .",
    "additionally , we also plot in the same figure in panel ( b ) and ( c ) the profile of the plane waves in the presence of nonzero @xmath165 .    due to the presence of the non - uniform cw background ( @xmath162 ) , we simulated the dynamics of a dark soliton in the framework of eq .",
    "( nls ) with initial conditions @xmath166 ,   \\label{initial - dark}\\]]where @xmath131 and @xmath167 determine the initial velocity and position of the dark soliton . in fig .",
    "[ ds1 ] , we plot simulated pictures of the interaction of the dark soliton with the @xmath1 dipole for parameter values indicated in the caption to the figure .",
    "similar to bright solitons considered above , the dark soliton is either transmitted or reflected . in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ ds1 ] , an additional weaker reflected dark soliton emerges , as a result of the interaction , in addition to the main passing soliton .",
    "another particular result is seen in panel ( d ) , where the reflected feature , observed at @xmath136 , is not a soliton but a shelf , propagating with the speed determined by the background amplitude ( the generation of shelves by dark solitons was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the analytical approximation for the dark - soliton dynamics , based on equations ( [ kappa])-([zeta ] ) for variables @xmath103 and @xmath168 , was derived in the framework of the adiabatic approach , which does not take into regard the generation of the additional dark soliton or non - soliton shelf , hence this approximation can not describe the observed phenomenology well enough .",
    "nevertheless , predictions of the analysis may qualitatively explain some features of the dynamics revealed by numerical simulations .",
    "for the sake of the comparison , obtaining coordinate @xmath169 from simulation results of eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) is straightforward , while amplitude @xmath170 can be identified as @xmath171 . note also that our analytical approximation is derived under the assumption @xmath172 .",
    "in that regard , our approximation should only be compared with dynamics in panels ( b ) and ( d ) . in particular , in the case shown in fig .",
    "[ ds1](b ) , the approximation correctly predicts that the incident dark soliton would pass through the @xmath1 dipole , although there is a discrepancy in approximating the phase shift of the soliton after interaction  most plausibly , caused by the fact that the adiabatic approximation can not take into account the generation of the additional reflected soliton , in this case .",
    "nevertheless , the approximation correctly predicts that the soliton accelerates in the vicinity of the dipole .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of bright and dark solitons in the model based on the focusing and defocusing nls equations with an embedded defect in the form of the @xmath1-symmetric dipole , combined with a local repulsive or attractive potential .",
    "the scattering problem for plane waves and broad incident packets was considered too in the framework of the linear version of the model .",
    "the numerical study for the focusing nonlinearity has produced threshold values of the velocity of the incident bright soliton above which it passes the local defect .",
    "for the defocusing nonlinearity , the interaction of dark solitons with the defect is studied in the numerical form too .",
    "parallel to the simulations , we have developed analytical approximations for both cases .",
    "for the bright solitons , the adiabatic quasi - particle approximation yields accurate results in the case when the repulsive potential is stronger than the gain - and - loss component of the defect .",
    "for the negligibly weak local potential , the analytical consideration goes beyond the limit of the adiabatic approximation , taking into regard the intrinsic chirp of the soliton .",
    "the respective semi - analytical results predict the threshold velocity in a reasonably accurate form too . for the dark solitons , the approximation qualitatively explains the transmission , acceleration and deceleration of the incident soliton .",
    "in addition , the exact solution for the dark soliton pinned by the @xmath1-symmetric defect was found too .",
