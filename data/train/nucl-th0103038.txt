    "near the neutron or proton drip lines , large pairing correlations are expected which can no longer be described by a small residual interaction .",
    "furthermore , the outermost nucleons are weakly bound ( which implies a large spatial extent ) , and they are strongly coupled to the particle continuum .",
    "these features represent major challenges for the mean field theories .",
    "we solve the self - consistent mean field plus pairing ( hartree - fock - bogoliubov ) equations for axially symmetric even - even nuclei on a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "we utilize the skyrme m@xmath0 interaction , and pairing is described either by a pure delta force or by a density - dependent delta interaction ( dddi ) .",
    "high numerical accuracy is achieved by representing the operators and wavefunctions in terms of basis - splines ; a combination of the galerkin and collocation method is utilized @xcite .",
    "our work represents a natural extension of the 1-d calculations for spherical nuclei by dobaczewski et al .",

    "we have successfully tested our numerical algorithm by solving the hfb equations for a constant pairing hamiltonian in which case the problem becomes equivalent to hf + bcs . as an example , we show in fig .",
    "[ ne22_en_bcs ] the quasiparticle energy spectrum of the normal and pairing density for @xmath1ne .",
    "the spectrum of the lattice hfb hamiltonian is obtained by direct diagonalization with lapack . in this way",
    ", we obtain the whole quasiparticle energy spectrum at once , up to about @xmath2 mev . in calculating observables , we cut off this spectrum at an equivalent s.p .",
    "energy of about 60 mev .",
    "a correct representation of high - energy continuum states is crucial for physics near the driplines .",
    "we wish to emphasize that this numerical test is non - trivial because the hfb code solves a _ quasiparticle _ energy spectrum ( upper and lower continuum , no lower bound ) while the hf + bcs codes solve for the energy spectrum of _ real particles _",
    "( one upper continuum only , lower bound ) .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss preliminary results obtained with the full hfb code .",
    "all calculations are for @xmath1ne with the skyrme m@xmath0 interaction in the p - h channel and a pure delta pairing interaction ( strength @xmath3 , taken from ref .",
    "we utilized b - spines of order @xmath4 , a lattice size of 8 fm in radial direction , and a lattice spacing of about 1 fm .",
    "[ ne22_en_hfb ] shows that both the normal density and the pairing density develop more structure in the quasiparticle energy spectrum , as compared to the bcs pairing case .",
    "this is in agreement with the results from 1-d calculations .",
    "[ ne22_pairdens ] shows contour plots of the pairing density for protons and neutrons .",
    "the square of the pairing density describes the probability of finding a _ correlated _ nucleon pair with opposite spin directions at position @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we are now in the process of adjusting the di and dddi pairing force parameters to the tin isotope chain and plan to do a detailed comparison for spherical nuclei with dobaczewski s 1-d hfb code @xcite .",
    "after these tests are finished , we will be in a position to address the new physics near the drip lines such as neutron halos and neutron skins , proton radioactivity etc .",
    "we are going to calculate binding energies , neutron and proton separation energies , pairing gaps , normal and pairing densities , rms radii , and electric or magnetic moments .",
    "we have adopted the skyrme force parameterization suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "currently , all of our hfb calculations are carried out with the skm@xmath0 interaction . in the near future ,",
    "we plan to investigate some of the more recent parameterizations , in particular sly4 and to explore the sensitivity of observables to these forces .",
    "we will also add constraints ( @xmath7 ) to the hfb code in order to calculate potential energy surfaces for nuclei far from stability .",
    "our long - range plan is to extend the current ground state theory to excited states , i.e. quasiparticle rpa on the lattice @xcite .",
    "this work was supported by the u. s. department of energy under contract de - fg02 - 96er40975 with vanderbilt university .",
    "some of the numerical calculations were carried out on cray - sv1 supercomputers at nersc ."
