    "intersections of brownian motions have been studied by mathematicians and physicists for a long time @xcite , @xcite . since in high dimensions ( @xmath0 ) brownian motions do not see each other , and in dimension @xmath1 intersection is certain , dimensions two , three and four are of particular interest . in dimension @xmath2 physicists , using arguments from conformal field theory , predicted the values of the intersection exponents for brownian motions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these results appeared out of reach for mathematicians until recent breakthroughs in joint work of greg lawler , oded schramm and wendelin werner . after establishing a series of properties of the brownian intersection exponents in @xcite , and their universality in @xcite , the introduction of the `` stochastic lwner evolution process '' in @xcite finally allowed the computation of all intersection exponents in a series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these developments brought new attention to the lwner equation , introduced some 80 years ago in @xcite as a step to prove part of the bieberbach conjecture .",
    "the original lwner evolution equation describes slit mappings interpolating between the identity map and a conformal map of the disk into itself , where the slit grows from the boundary to the interior . in the application to the calculation of brownian intersection exponents the lwner evolution",
    "is more generally considered as a `` hull '' growing from the boundary into a domain , @xcite .",
    "the main point of this paper is to consider the `` generalized '' slit mappings as cauchy transforms of probability measures and to study the consequences of this viewpoint .",
    "cauchy transforms of probability measures play a central role in free probability , a branch of noncommutative probability pioneered by dan voiculescu .",
    "besides its applications to operator theory and @xmath3-algebras it also provides a framework for the limit of large random @xmath4-matrices as @xmath5 , @xcite . in physics",
    "these concepts were used for the construction of the master field , @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the physics approach to the calculation of brownian intersection exponents as presented in @xcite also relies on partition functions of large random matrices .",
    "i show in this paper that various concepts and central objects of noncommutative probability appear naturally in the context of the lwner equation once one takes the above - mentioned viewpoint .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we begin with an introduction to those aspects of noncommutative probability that will be needed later on : free independence , distribution of noncommutative random variables , additive and multiplicative free convolution , cauchy transform , @xmath6- and @xmath7-transform , semicircle law and convolution semigroups .",
    "this section is written with the ( classical ) probabilist in mind who may not have been exposed to noncommutative probability before .",
    "those already familiar with noncommutative probability may want to browse through those pages since notational conventions are set there .",
    "the next section introduces the chordal and radial lwner equations .",
    "the stochastic lwner evolution is also described here .",
    "the final section shows how noncommutative processes arise from lwner s equation .",
    "we first show that the conformal maps given by the solution of the lwner equation indeed are cauchy transforms of probability measures , on @xmath8 for the chordal lwner equation and on the unit circle @xmath9 in the radial case .",
    "thus the chordal case corresponds to self - adjoint random variables and the radial case to unitary random variables .",
    "we show in theorem [ t : loewnermap ] that the lwner equation induces a map from continuous paths in the space of measures to the continuous paths in the space of probability measures .",
    "the fixed point of this map is shown to be the convolution semigroup for the semicircle law in the chordal case , and its unitary analogue in the radial case .",
    "theorem [ t : spread ] shows that the lwner evolution corresponds to a spreading out of a distribution .",
    "figures [ fi : semicircledensity ] and [ fi : arcsinedensity ] make this particularly apparent . finally , theorems [ t : cmarkov ] and [ t : rmarkov ] show that the ( deterministic ) lwner evolution gives rise to a markov process .",
    "a noncommutative probability space is a unital algebra @xmath10 over @xmath11 together with a linear functional @xmath12 satisfying @xmath13 .",
    "elements @xmath14 are called random variables .",

    "however , the calculation shows that the expectation of the product @xmath44 can be reduced to the computation of expectations in the subalgebras @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "more generally the following holds : if @xmath47 is a family of free subalgebras of @xmath10 , then , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 can be computed explicitly from the restriction of @xmath51 to the algebras @xmath52 , see ( * ? ? ?",
