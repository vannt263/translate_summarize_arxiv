    "graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms densely packed in a honeycomb lattice .",
    "this material was found in its free state only recently , when individual graphene samples of a few microns in size were isolated by micromechanical cleavage of graphite @xcite .",
    "the current intense interest in graphene is driven by both the unusual physics involved and a realistic promise of device applications . among relativistic like phenomena observed in graphene so far ,",
    "there are two new types of the integer quantum hall effect and the presence of minimal metallic conductivity of about one conductivity quantum@xcite . transport properties of graphene are interesting because of their unique topological structure @xcite .",
    "there have been some reports on experimental study of transport in graphene @xcite .",
    "various calculations have been performed to understand energy bands of graphene @xcite .",
    "it has been successful in the study of various properties including the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite , optical absorption spectra @xcite , quantum tunneling in graphene - based structures @xcite , ferromagnetism @xcite and instabilities in the presence and absence of a magnetic field @xcite .    in a two - dimensional world",
    ", there are two basic motions : forward and backward .",
    "random scattering can cause them to mix , which leads to resistance . just as we have learned from the basic traffic control",
    ", it would be much better if we could spatially filter the counterflow directions .",
    "this effect could be used to produce a valley - polarized current out of an unpolarized stream of electrons due to line defect particularly in graphene @xcite .",
    "the electronic transport properties of graphene with defects and impurities exhibit pronounced differences from those of conventional two dimensional electron systems investigated in the past .",
    "the basic question that we seek to answer is what happens to the tunneling as we approach the dirac point of zero carrier concentration with the presence of electrically charged scatters .    , where @xmath0 is the length of the strip with the width @xmath1 .",
    "the indices @xmath2 , @xmath3 label the two sublattices of the honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms has different atomic potentials , which can be tuned . ]    in the present work we consider the effects of atomic potential fluctions in the setup depicted in fig .",
    "1 . at low doping the conductance is determined by quasiparticle tunneling , which is independent of the boundary conditions in the @xmath4-direction if @xmath5 .",
    "the quasiparticle excitation spectrum of the graphene - based junction consists of the positive eigenvalues of the dirac equation .",
    "the dirac equation has the form of two equations for electron @xmath6 and hole wavefunctions @xmath7 . in this study",
    "we restrict ourselves to the single - valley dirac equation for graphene @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a spinor of wave amplitudes for two nonequivalent sites of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the fermi energy @xmath10 and the impurity potential v ( x , y ) in the graphene sample ( @xmath11 ) are considered to be much smaller than the fermi energy @xmath12 in the ideal metallic leads ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) . for zero doping",
    "the conductance is determined by the states at the dirac point , @xmath15 .",
    "transport properties at finite energies determine the conductance of doped graphene .    since for aspect ratios @xmath16 the boundary conditions in the @xmath4-direction are irrelevant ,",
    "so we take periodic boundary conditions for simplicity .",
    "different wave vectors @xmath17=2@xmath18n / w ( with n=0 , @xmath19 1 , @xmath19 2 ,  ) in the @xmath4-direction parallel to the interfaces(at the points @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) and not coupled ,",
    "so we can consider each transverse mode separately .",
    "without impurity in the bulk at a given energy @xmath10 and transverse wave vector @xmath22 we have up to two basis states @xmath23 with the definitions @xmath24 , \\\\      & & k(\\epsilon)=(\\hbar v_{f})^{-1}(\\epsilon+e_{f})\\cos(\\alpha )    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the angle @xmath25 @xmath26 ( -@xmath18/2,@xmath18/2 ) is the angle between the initial and final wave vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 . with this sign convention the state @xmath29 move in the @xmath30 , while @xmath31 move in the @xmath32 direction .",
    "the factor @xmath33 ensure that two states carry the same particle current .    considering a back scattering process @xmath34 in an arbitrary external potential",
    "we will confine ourselves to states in the vicinity of the @xmath35 point , but the extension to states near a @xmath36 point is straightforward .",
    "we have @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "rotation in spin space can be obtained through the replacement @xmath39 corresponding to the electron motion of a time - reversal path .",
    "when the wave vector @xmath40 is rotated in the anticlockwise direction adiabatically as a function of time @xmath41 around the origin for a time interval @xmath42 , the wavefunction is changed into @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the `` spin '' part of an eigenfunction of the eq .",
    "[ diraceq ] and @xmath45 is berry s phase .",
    "choosing @xmath46 in such a way that the wave function becomes continuous as a function of @xmath47 and given by @xmath48 this shows that the rotation in the @xmath40 space by @xmath49 leads to the change in the phase by @xmath50 , i.e. , a sign change .",
    "a similar phase change of back scattering process is the origin of the so - called anti - localization effect in systems with strong spin - orbit scattering@xcite .",
    "this anti - localization effect was observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the absence of back scattering can be destroyed by various effects .",
    "when the potential range becomes shorter than the lattice constant , the back scattering appears two reasons .",
    "the first is the appearance of inter - valley matrix elements between @xmath35 and @xmath51 points @xcite .",
    "the second , which we investigate in this work , is that the effective potential of an impurity for @xmath2 and @xmath3 sites in honeycomb lattice can be different .",
    "this causes mixing of the spin space and the momentum space .",
    "there is an absence of back scattering for long range impurities .",
    "this can be seen easily : using the formalism of the previous subsection we can simply show that the matrix element of the back - scattering process is zero @xmath52    ( here @xmath53 is the unit cell area of the graphene lattice ) .",
    "this is rather dramatic since all real materials have impurities , and it is normally these which determine the transport properties of the material .",
    "however , in the case of graphene the impurities do nt scatter , i.e. they are effectively not there , and hence one has the possibility of coherent transport in graphene .",
    "we first determine the transfer matrix @xmath54 of the @xmath55th mode @xmath56 through the undoped graphene ribbon .",
    "the evolution of @xmath57 inside the graphene sample can be written as @xmath58 , where the transfer matrix @xmath59 should satisfy a generalized unitarity condition @xmath60 in general eq.[imp ] ( ignoring an irrelevant scalar phase factor ) restricts @xmath61 to a three - parameter form @xmath62 the real parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath25 depend on the boundary at the scale of the lattice constant and they can not be determined from the dirac equations . in this work",
    "we consider the ideal interfaces @xmath20 and @xmath21 case , when @xmath65 . from the dirac eq.[diraceq ] we obtain the differential equation @xmath66 with solution for @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the longitudinal wave vector , @xmath17 is the transversal wave vector .",
    "the total transfer matrix through the impurity - free graphene ribbon ( @xmath11 ) is @xmath70 now we construct the transfer matrix for the electron ( hole ) quasiparticle excitations in the graphene ribbon for disorder potential case , where @xmath71 is the charged impurity potential given by a diagonal matrix , i.e. , @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) is the corresponding microscopic potential and smooth on atomic scales , which is localized along a line @xmath75 and placed in the zone corner @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) of sublattice @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the fermi - energy @xmath10 and impurity potential @xmath71 ( eq.[pot ] ) in graphene sample ( @xmath11 ) are considered to be much smaller than the fermi - energy @xmath12 in the ideal metallic leads ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) . for zero doping the conductance is determined by the states at the dirac point , @xmath15 .",
    "transport properties at finite energies determine the conductance of doped graphene .",
