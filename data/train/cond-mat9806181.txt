    "the value of @xmath125 has a simple meaning , it corresponds to the number of zeroes of wave function @xmath126 within the interval @xmath127 , by analogy with the known property of @xmath128 .",
    "the spectrum of ( [ sphdifeq ] ) is then given by a series @xcite          where plus ( minus ) sign corresponds to even ( odd ) values of @xmath133 .",
    "@xcite the functions @xmath135 are found as a series in the laguerre polynomials @xmath136 ; in the main order of @xmath137 they can be written as      we see that in the main order of @xmath1 the landau quantization takes place , i.e.  the spectrum ( [ ene - strong ] ) is that of quantum oscillator with the cyclotron frequency being the energy quantum .",
    "@xcite the convergence and hence the applicability of the series ( [ ene - strong ] ) is given by the condition @xmath139 . in its turn , it means @xcite that all @xmath125 zeroes of the approximate eigenfunction @xmath140 in ( [ wf - strong1 ] ) lie in the northern hemisphere , @xmath141 , as they should .",
    "we notice the following important property of the spectrum ( [ ene - strong ] ) . for given non - positive @xmath107 the values of @xmath142 corresponding to @xmath143 and @xmath144 coincide .",
    "this property and the form of the wave function ( [ wf - strong0 ] ) can be understood as follows . at @xmath145 the field - induced potential @xmath146 in ( [ sphdifeq ] ) localizes the particles near the poles of the sphere .",
    "this form of two - well potential leads to the discussed degeneracy of energy levels , while the total wave function is given by a symmetrization ( [ wf - strong0 ] ) of the wave functions ( [ wf - strong1 ] ) related to each of the wells .",
    "the possibility of quantum tunneling between the wells lifts the degeneracy and produces the exponentially small energy splitting ( @xmath147 ) between the states @xmath148 and @xmath149 ( [ wf - strong0 ] ) .",
    "@xcite    it would be tempting to obtain the green s function at @xmath74 in the closed form",
    ". it can be done at the following simplifications .",
    "first , we neglect the exponentially small splitting and notice that @xmath150 $ ] , i.e. the correlations within one hemisphere only survive .",
    "now we leave only the leading terms ( [ wf - strong1 ] ) of the wave functions and @xmath151 terms in energies ( [ ene - strong ] ) . the necessity to restrict the summation in ( [ defg ] ) by the terms with @xmath152",
    "could be modelled by inclusion of the cutoff factor @xmath153 with @xmath154 into ( [ defg ] ) .",
    "we put @xmath155 for simplicity of writing and raise the denominator into the exponent , @xmath156 .",
    "next we perform the summation over @xmath125 with the use of bilinear generating function for the laguerre polynomials @xcite :      with the modified bessel function @xmath158 ; in our case @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 . making use of the property @xmath162 and rescaling @xmath163",
    "we arrive at the intermediate formula for @xmath164 :      the summation over @xmath107 is now easily done ( @xmath166 ) and we obtain the green s function as a sum of two terms , referring to two hemispheres .",
    "the `` northern '' term , corresponding to the above expression , is given by      with the analogue of the distance on the sphere @xmath168 $ ] and that of the vector product @xmath169 .",
    "the form of the `` southern '' term is obtained by changing @xmath170 and @xmath171 in these expressions .",
    "the last integral is reduced for vanishing @xmath172 to the hypergeometric function @xmath173 and we obtain the `` northern '' term in the form   :    @xmath174       \\psi\\left[\\frac12 -\\frac\\omega{\\omega_c},1 ; \\rho \\right ] ,       \\nonumber \\\\ & = &       \\frac{m_e}{4\\pi }        e^{iv-\\rho/2 -\\delta \\omega/\\omega_c }       \\sum_{n=0}^ { \\infty}\\frac{l_n(\\rho)}{\\omega/\\omega_c - n-1/2}.       \\label{g - strong1 }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      let us discuss the applicability of ( [ g - strong1 ] ) .",
    "our derivation was straightforward until ( [ g - strong ] ) , while the last step demanded @xmath175 .",
    "the incomplete restructuring of the spectrum into the landau level scheme is absent in the usual planar geometry , wherein one would put @xmath176 and the expression ( [ g - strong1 ] ) would be exact . in the spherical case we can not treat the higher levels with @xmath177 in an analytical way",
    ", it is mimicked in ( [ g - strong1 ] ) by the appearance of the exponential cutoff at @xmath178 .",
    "a subtler issue in justifying ( [ g - strong1 ] ) is the shift of the last integration in ( [ g - strong ] ) to the interval @xmath179 .",
    "the integration over the remaining segments @xmath180 yields the factor @xmath181 , thus the contribution of these segments to the green s function has no poles in @xmath97 .",
    "this contribution could be combined with the smooth ( real ) part of @xmath182 stemming from the consideration of the highest energy levels .",
    "the finite value of the cutoff parameter @xmath172 in ( [ g - strong1 ] ) becomes important for the one - point correlation function , i.e. at @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "the residues of the green s function define the local density of states ( ldos ) by the relation @xmath186 /(2\\pi i ) $ ] .",
    "if we assume that @xmath125 lowest landau levels are filled by the electrons , then it follows from ( [ g - strong1 ] ) that the ldos is given by @xmath187 . in this case",
    "the finite @xmath188 provides a smooth variation of ldos of the form @xmath189,\\ ] ] which variation is absent in the usual planar geometry .",
    "this result , however , may depend on the approximations made and requires further numerical investigation .",
    "it should be stressed that at the intermediate fields , at @xmath190 and @xmath191 , the spectrum and wave functions are not principally reduced to closed expressions of hypergeometric type .",
    "the numerical methods are indispensable here .",
    "we calculated the evolution with @xmath1 of the energy levels with @xmath192 by diagonalizing the @xmath193 tridiagonal matrices in the basis of @xmath194 .",
    "the results are shown in the fig.[fig : lines ] where we made a following convention . from the general property of eq.([sphdifeq ] ) it follows that @xmath195 with formally negative @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite for better readability of the graph , it is possible then to show all the data , plotting only half of them with one sign of @xmath107 but in the formally extended region of @xmath1 .",
    "one can see in the fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] that the degeneracy at @xmath196 is eventually changed by the landau levels formation at @xmath197 . in the intermediate region @xmath198 the absence of any structure in the levels scheme is noted .",
    "the mesh of lines at the intermediate fields mimicks the chaotic behavior , although this is not so .",
    "both in the quantum problem considered here and in its classical couterpart one has two variables @xmath199 and two integrals of motion , the energy and the projection of the angular momentum onto the field direction . to obtain chaos",
