    "quasars with redshifts larger than 4 were first discovered more than a decade ago ( warren et  al .",
    "recently many new @xmath0 quasars have been discovered ( e.g. , fan et  al . 1999 , 2000 ) with expectations of an even greater increase in the near future due to new surveys ( e.g. ,",
    "the sloan digital sky survey should identify @xmath1 quasars with @xmath2   schneider 1999 ; york et  al .",
    "currently there are 85 @xmath0 quasars that have appeared in journals , and an additional number can be found on various world wide web pages .",
    "quasars at @xmath0 provide us with direct information about the first 10% of cosmic time .",
    "they are among the most luminous objects known , and from the eddington limit many require @xmath3  @xmath4@xmath5  m@xmath6 black holes .",
    "they have wide cosmological importance since they must be associated with deep potential wells in the earliest massive collapsed structures , and their strong evolution provides clues about the process by which the remarkably homogeneous @xmath7 universe revealed by the cosmic microwave background is transformed into the inhomogeneous universe seen today ( e.g. , efstathiou & rees 1988 ; turner 1991 ) .    to date @xmath0 quasars",
    "have been mainly studied at optical wavelengths ( e.g. , in order to determine their redshifts )",
    ". there has also been some progress in studying their far - infrared and radio properties ( e.g. , schmidt et  al .",
    "1995 ; omont et  al . 1996",
    "; mcmahon et  al .",
    "however , their properties as a whole at these and other wavelengths have not yet been fully explored .",
    "x - ray emission appears to be a universal property of quasars at @xmath8  02 , and x - rays have also been studied from many @xmath8  24 quasars . however , at @xmath0 the x - ray properties of quasars are much less well understood ; only six @xmath0 quasars have been detected in x - ray .",
    "the luminous x - ray emission from quasars reveals the physical conditions in the immediate vicinities of their black holes , and x - ray studies of high - redshift quasars can in principle discover if quasar central power sources and quasar environments evolve over cosmic time ( e.g. , bechtold et  al .",
    "1994b ; blair et  al .",
    "1998 ; elvis et  al . 1998 ; fiore et  al . 1998 ) .",
    "we list the @xmath0 quasars previously detected in the x - ray band in table  1 . for each quasar",
    "we give , in the first seven columns , its coordinates , redshift , absorption - corrected x - ray flux in the detection band , and the reference to the paper where the x - ray detection was made . while the most basic x - ray properties ( e.g. , @xmath9 , the slope of a nominal power law between 2500    and 2  kev ) of these quasars appear to be generally consistent with those of quasars at lower redshifts , the constraints are not tight and require substantial improvement .",
    "comparisons of these properties with those of the majority of low - redshift quasars are difficult as most of the x - ray detected @xmath0 quasars were selected in different ways : three of them are x - ray selected objects , two are radio selected , and only one is optically selected .    all objects but one in table  1 were detected using _ rosat _ , demonstrating the ability of this satellite to detect @xmath0 quasars .",
    "encouraged by this we have systematically searched for detections of @xmath0 quasars in the _ rosat _ public database . in this paper",
    "we present our results , which double the number of @xmath0 quasars detected in x - rays .",
    "we increase the number of optically selected @xmath0 quasars from one to seven and provide limits for 15 others . in ",
    "2 we present the database search and in   3 we discuss our results .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the cosmological parameters @xmath10 km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we define the energy index @xmath13 as @xmath14 and likewise the photon index @xmath15 with photon flux density @xmath16 in photons  @xmath17  s@xmath11  kev@xmath11 . unless otherwise noted , we use @xmath18 in the uv - optical range and @xmath19 in the x - ray range .",
    "these are representative values of these parameters for lower redshift quasars ( e.g. , netzer 1990 ; reeves et  al .",
    "we have searched the _ rosat _ public database for all fields which include the optical positions of @xmath0 quasars in the literature . we have found 27 quasars positions ( out of the total 85 @xmath0 quasars ) to lie in _ rosat _ fields . for ten quasars we found only one observation , while for the others there were two or more .",
    "we retrieved from the _ rosat _ public database up to four observations ( when available ) for each quasar .",
    "we preferentially chose long observations where the quasar was close to the field s center .",
    "twenty - six quasars were observed by the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ; pfeffermann et  al .",
    "1987 ) with several of them also having high resolution imager ( hri ; david et  al .",
    "1999 ) observations , and one quasar was observed only with the hri . out of the 27 quasars , 12 were the observation s target and 15 were serendipitously in the detector s field of view .",
    "all observations were processed using the pros software in iraf .",
    "we have manually inspected the images ( and smoothed versions thereof ) and have measured the net counts around the optical positions of the quasars .",
    "typically pspc positions are good to @xmath202030  ( e.g. , voges et  al .",
    "1996 ) , and indeed all our detections but one are @xmath21  from the optical position .",
    "the aperture size for count extraction was scaled to take into account the size of the point spread function ( psf ) at the off - axis angle of the quasar .",
    "we were able to detect , at above the 2.5@xmath22 level , an x - ray source and extract the x - ray count rate for nine quasars . for the other 18 quasars we were only able to determine upper limits to their x - ray count rates .",
    "we have also searched for x - ray detections of 86 quasars listed on world wide web pages but not in the literature , and we find none .",
    "in the upper part of table  [ properties ] we present the quasars detected .",

    "we use the pimms software ( mukai 1997 ) to define a power law with photon index @xmath28 , which is then used in the xspec software ( arnaud 1996 ) to evaluate the absorption - corrected 0.12 kev observed flux , which is listed in column ( 15 ) . from this power law",
    "we also calculated the rest - frame 2-kev flux density and luminosity which are listed in columns ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) .",
    "( using pros to calculate these quantities yields consistent results . ) finally , we list in column ( 18 ) the effective optical - to - x - ray power - law slope , @xmath9 , defined as : @xmath29 } { \\log[\\nu ( 2\\,{\\rm kev})/\\nu ( 2500\\,{\\mbox\\aa } ) ] } \\ \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath30 s are flux densities at the given wavelengths and @xmath31 s are the corresponding frequencies . the uncertainties for the fluxes , luminosities , and @xmath9 values can be propagated from the relative error on the number of counts , which has a mean value of 30% .",
    "another uncertainty involves our assumption of @xmath28 .",
    "[ properties ]    = 20.0 cm    as radio - quiet quasars typically have @xmath32=1.72.3 , our assumption of @xmath28 might introduce an additional uncertainty of @xmath3315% in the flux estimates . as the true @xmath32 for each quasar is unknown ( other than gb1428 + 4217 and gb1508 + 5714 ) , we do not quote an error on the latter quantities .",
    "we estimate the total fractional uncertainties for the fluxes to be in the range of 3050% .",
    "0.06 cm x - ray images of all nine detected quasars are presented in fig .  [ image ] which was created using the adaptive smoothing method of ebeling , white , & rangarajan ( 2000 ) applied to the full - band images . for most of the images we used a 2.5@xmath22 level of smoothing ; for three low-@xmath22 detected objects ( br0951@xmath340450 , bri0952@xmath340115 , and br1202@xmath340725 ) we used a 2.0@xmath22 level of smoothing .    0.06 cm for each of the pspc observations listed in the upper part of table  [ properties ] we also calculated the x - ray counts in the soft band ( 0.10.5 kev ) and the hard band ( 0.52.0 kev ) .",
    "we used these to calculate the rest - frame 2-kev flux density , luminosity , and @xmath9 , in the same way as described above .",
    "the results were similar to the broad - band results .",
    "however , as the statistical uncertainties in the soft and hard bands were large due the small number of counts ( note the small number of counts in the broad band ",
    "column [ 13 ] of table  [ properties ] ) , we do not include these results in our analysis .",
    "0.06 cm in the lower part of table  [ properties ] we list the @xmath0 quasars which we were unable to detect in the x - ray observations . for these quasars",
    "we give 3@xmath22 upper limits ( listed in column [ 13 ] ) , where @xmath22 is the square root of the counts in an aperture of size appropriate to the quasar s off - axis angle and centered at the quasar s optical position . for each quasar",
    "we list the one observation which gave the faintest upper limit .",
    "0.06 cm for 27 objects the number of expected detections which are merely statistical fluctuations at the 2.5@xmath22 level is 0.17 ; this suggests that none of our detections is likely to be a background fluctuation .",
    "we also estimated the probability that our x - ray quasar detections are merely of unrelated x - ray sources that happen to be coincident with the @xmath0 quasars optical positions .",
    "we shifted the 27 quasars positions by eight arcmin in eight different directions and looked again for x - ray detections ( in the same manner as was done for the real optical positions ) . at the new positions we found seven x - ray sources which met our detection criteria regarding significant level and positional coincidence .",
    "this test shows that among our nine x - ray detections there might be one source which is not the counterpart of the quasar but an x - ray source which happened to be in that position by chance .",
    "additional suggestive evidence that the number of false detections is small is that we have detected only the brighter quasars out of the total 27 ( see fig .",
    "[ his ] and   [ discussion ] ) ; if our detections had random contamination by foreground sources then their distribution would not be correlated with quasar luminosity .",
    "0.06 cm for comparison purposes we present some properties of the x - ray detected @xmath0 quasars known prior to this work in table  1 .",
    "we list the ab@xmath23 magnitudes in column ( 8) and the galactic column densities in column ( 9 ) .",
    "based on the ab@xmath23 magnitudes we calculate the rest - frame 2500    flux densities and luminosities which are listed in columns ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) , and the absolute @xmath26 magnitudes in column ( 12 ) .",
    "we used the x - ray fluxes and bands from columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) and the pimms software to define a simple power law with @xmath28 .",
    "this power law was used to estimate the rest - frame 2-kev flux den-    = 8.5 cm    sity and luminosity which are listed in columns ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) .",
    "we list the resulting @xmath9 in column ( 15 ) .",
    "in most cases where we detect x - ray sources at the quasars optical positions they are very close to the detection limit . comparing the data for the quasars which are x - ray detected to those which are not , we notice several trends .",
    "the detected quasars are among the brighter in the optical band ( see fig .",
    "[ his ] for the @xmath35 distribution ) .",
    "if the undetected quasars have comparable x - ray luminosities to the detected ones , we suggest that they were mainly not detected since they were observed at the edges of the pspc field where the psf and vignetting are larger . in the two cases where",
    "high luminosity quasars were observed close to the pspc field center ( bri1050@xmath340000 , br1144@xmath340723 ) , we attribute the non - detections to short exposure times .    three objects which we detected had already been reported as x - ray emitters in the past ( q0000@xmath342619 , gb1428 + 4217 , and rxj1759.4 + 6638 ) .",
    "the x - ray properties we have measured for them are in agreement with the previous reported properties ( see table  1 ) .",
    "we have not detected the other three quasars in table  1 since the data for rxj1028.6@xmath340844 are not public ( it was detected in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ) , gb1508 + 5714 was not observed by _ rosat _ , and rxj105225.9",

    "these include gb1428 + 4217 , gb1508 + 5714 , and rxj1028.6@xmath340844 which have had their x - ray data published prior to this work ( table  1 ) , pks1251@xmath34407 , for which we present an x - ray upper limit , and gb1713 + 2148 , whose _ rosat _ observation is not yet public .",
    "out of these objects , gb1428 + 4217 and gb1508 + 5714 show evidence for relativistic beaming ( e.g. , moran & helfand 1997 ; fabian et  al .",

    "most of the quasars in this study are undetected by the nvss , and thus we provide only upper limits .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned radio - loud quasars we detect pc0027 + 0525 to be radio - loud and bri1050 - 0000 , rxj1759.4 + 6638 , and pc2331 + 0216 to be intermediate between the two radio classes ( see also mcmahon et  al .",
    "all other quasars ( but two ) have @xmath36 upper limits which designate them as being radio - quiet .",
    "this result is in agreement with other radio and far - ir studies of these @xmath0 quasars which find them to be radio - quiet ( e.g. , schneider et  al .",

    "we have translated the @xmath9 given in brandt et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) for a flux density at 3000    to that for a flux density at 2500   . to carry out this comparison we consider only the optically selected @xmath0 quasars since the pg sample is an optically selected sample .",
    "the @xmath9 distribution for the seven optically - selected objects is consistent with the @xmath9 distribution of the pg quasars and with the @xmath9 distribution usually found for quasars ( e.g. , wilkes et al .",
    "1994 ; green et  al .",
    "we also use all optically selected objects in this study , including the ones with upper limits on their x - ray properties , to derive the mean @xmath9 . to that purpose",
    "we have used the asurv software package rev 1.2 ( lavalley , isobe & feigelson 1992 ) , which implements the survival analysis methods presented in feigelson & nelson ( 1985 ) and isobe , feigelson , & nelson ( 1986 ) .        three of the detected quasars have @xmath42 ( fig .  [ aoxhis ] ) .",
    "this is not consistent with the pg quasars @xmath9 distribution , and indeed these three quasars are the ones known to be radio - loud with two of them being blazar - type objects , while the pg quasars are mainly radio - quiet with no blazars among them .",

    "three of our detected quasars have two _ rosat _ observations ( table  [ properties ] ) . in all cases",
    "the fluxes from different observations agree to within the measurement uncertainty of @xmath3330% , and no flux variations over time are detected .",
    "the quasar gb1428 + 4217 has six _ rosat _ observations and was found to vary by a factor of two over a timescale of two weeks ( or less ) , which corresponds to less than 2.5 days in the source s rest - frame , a result not unexpected in that this quasar is a flat - spectrum radio - loud blazar ( fabian et  al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "the observed 0.12 kev band corresponds to a rest - frame band of 0.510 kev at @xmath44 .",
    "emission at the low end of this bandpass can originate from an accretion disk , but is mainly thought to arise from the surrounding corona ( e.g. , fabian 1994 ) .",
    "detecting x - ray emission in this band from @xmath0 quasars suggests that similar processes are taking place in low - redshift and the highest - redshift quasars .",
    "we have established that in almost all cases where @xmath0 quasars were observed at the center of the pspc field and the exposure times were sufficiently long ( as anticipated from their optical luminosities ) , an x - ray source was found at the optical position of the quasar . as two , and possibly three , of the objects detected before our paper are `` peculiar '' blazar - type objects , we have more than doubled the number of optically selected @xmath0 quasars detected in the x - ray band and determined that @xmath9 in these quasars is similar to that of lower @xmath45 quasars . at present",
