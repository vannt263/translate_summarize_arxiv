    "the understanding of the low temperature behavior of spin glass systems  @xcite is both a very interesting and challenging problem and one of the most relevant open questions in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "the mean field theory of the model has been solved  @xcite , and the rigorous mathematical proof that this solution is correct  @xcite made the situation very clear . in finite dimensional spin glass however , the situation is completely open , and there is no general agreement on what happens in the infinite volume limit ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the two main possibilities are on one side that in a finite dimension the model behaves as in mean field  @xcite ( this is the replica symmetry breaking , rsb , picture ) , by preserving all or most of the very peculiar features of the mean field theory , and on the other side that the so called droplet picture  @xcite ( where only two stable states are relevant for the critical behavior of the system ) is realized . for some detailed analysis of the two points of view",
    "see for example  @xcite .",
    "the tnt scenario  @xcite suggests an intermediate situation ( the trivial - non - trivial picture ) where the link overlap does not have a complex behavior ; here we only estimate the usual overlap .",
    "even if it is very plausible that the final answer to this crucial question will not come from numerical experiments , it is clear that today large scale , large volume , very accurate numerical simulations can allow to at least approach the relevant low @xmath1 , large @xmath4 , regime , and give very relevant hints about the physical behavior of such systems in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the numerical simulations of the janus supercomputer  @xcite ( a special purpose computer  @xcite specially built to simulate very effectively spin systems with discrete variables and couplings ) have produced a large set of well thermalized spin glass configurations on large ( since we are considering spin glasses : the same lattice sizes would not be so large for , say , an ising model with random field ) systems at low @xmath1 : our analysis will be based on these spin configurations .",
    "we take the approach , that has been discussed in  @xcite , of considering local magnetizations and correlation functions for a given disorder sample ( without averaging over the disorder ) . this approach can give a very complete picture , and allow detecting important features of the system .",
    "we will mainly use spin - spin correlation functions , @xmath5 ( where the brackets indicate the thermal average , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are two lattice sites , and @xmath8 denotes a given realization of the couplings ) and build upon how much two sites are correlated in a given sample .    using the values of the @xmath9 we will build connected clusters of correlated spins .",
    "these clusters are related to excitations that during the dynamics tend to move in a coherent way : their spins are very correlated . in this sense",
    "these connected clusters are good proxies of _ droplets _ and studying their properties allows us to get information about the _ droplets_. in ref .",
    "@xcite a similar approach was taken to study excitations at @xmath10 .",
    "it is thanks to the availability of well - thermalized configurations from janus for many disorder realizations that we are able to analyze the finite small @xmath1 region .",
    "we study here the @xmath0 edwards anderson spin glass with binary couplings .",
    "we analyze well thermalized , equilibrium spin configurations obtained with large scale numerical simulations by the janus collaboration  @xcite based on parallel tempering  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for all the parameters of the numerical simulation ) .",
    "we deal with @xmath11 samples of quenched disorder and many independent spin configurations per disorder sample ( for each lattice size ) , on simple cubic lattices of sizes going up to @xmath12 , for temperatures down to @xmath13 , with periodic boundary conditions .    for a given disorder sample and lattice site @xmath6",
    ", we form the ( connected ) cluster @xmath14 by adding recursively to @xmath14 all sites @xmath7 whose correlation function @xmath15 is larger in absolute value than a given threshold @xmath16 . when this is done , we only keep the connected component containing the site @xmath6 .",
    "the value of the threshold @xmath17 is an important parameter of our construction : if it is very small the cluster will fill all the available space , and it will have no boundary , while if it is very large @xmath14 will be small ( but its complement , formed from all lattice sites that do not belong to @xmath14 , will be large ) .",
    "we would expect that in the physically relevant range of values of @xmath16 the universal results of our computation ( like , for example , the critical exponents ) should not depend on @xmath16 , and we will verify that this is indeed the case .    for a given sample we will consider both the set of the @xmath4 ( connected ) clusters @xmath14 , analyzing their volume @xmath18 and their surface @xmath19 ( defined as the size of the set of sites which belong to the cluster and have at least one first neighboring site that does not belong to it ) , and properties obtained by averaging over the different clusters @xmath14 ( e.g. the cluster average volume @xmath20 and average surface @xmath21 ) .",
    "all these quantities should be labeled also with an index @xmath8 , denoting the disorder sample we are considering , but we will omit this label for the sake of a clearer notation .",
    "we will try to determine how quantities like @xmath20 and @xmath21 scale with the lattice size .",
    ".(a ) and [ fig_1].(b ) we plot the quantities @xmath22 versus @xmath23 for all clusters @xmath14 ( @xmath24 ) for two representative disorder samples",
    ". symbols of different colors and shapes are used ( like in figures [ fig_1].(c ) and [ fig_1].(d ) ) , for different values of the threshold @xmath16 : black squares are for a threshold of @xmath25 , cyan triangles pointing down @xmath26 , blue triangles pointing up @xmath27 , green circles @xmath28 and red squares @xmath29 . in figure",
    "[ fig_1].(c ) we show averages over all clusters @xmath14 for a given sample ( each point is for a given disorder realization , all disorder realizations are plotted ) , under the constraint @xmath30 ( see text ) : in figure [ fig_1].(d ) we restrict the average to percolating clusters ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "[ fig_1],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we start by showing what happens in two representative disorder samples in figure [ fig_1].a and [ fig_1].b .",
    "both figures are scatter plot that shows the cluster surface density @xmath31 versus the cluster volume density @xmath32 for cluster @xmath33 .",
    "each point is for one of the @xmath4 clusters one can construct when considering the disorder realization @xmath34 .",
    "we show data for our largest lattice , with @xmath35 ( also , here and in the rest of this note , @xmath36 ) .",
    "different colors are for clusters reconstructed by using different values of @xmath16 . scaling for the different values of @xmath16 is good : data points with different colors fall on the same curve .",
    "the two samples we show behave quite differently : in the one on the right ( where larger clusters are present : the maximum @xmath37 value is larger than @xmath28 ) @xmath38 versus @xmath37 saturates and starts to decrease for @xmath39 .",
    "this decrease has a clear reason , due to finite size effects : when clusters reach a size comparable to the lattice size ( that has periodic boundary conditions ) it fills up all the available space , and it has no space to have a boundary . as @xmath40 the maximum allowed surface density goes to zero . because of this , we have introduced a cutoff @xmath41 , and we discard from our analysis the clusters such that @xmath42 .",
    "we have also analyzed the data for different values of @xmath41 in the range @xmath43 , and our claims will turn out not to depend sensitively on the choice of @xmath41 . in the two lower figures [ fig_1].c and [ fig_1].d we show averages of the cluster volume and surface density ( with cutoff @xmath30 ) over all sites in individual realizations of the disorder .",
    "each point represents one disorder sample . in the plot on the left",
    ", an average is done over all clusters ( with @xmath30 ) while on the right the average is done over percolating clusters only ( defined as connected clusters that span the whole lattice in at least one direction ) .",
    "when one considers all clusters , the small clusters , containing a number of spin of order one , play an important role . selecting and analyzing instead only percolating clusters",
    "one is keeping only the largest clusters ( again with @xmath30 ) : in a non - critical situations , with a finite correlation length and correlations that fade away exponentially no such clusters would exists in the infinite volume limit .",
    "the fact that we do find that for increasing @xmath4 a finite fraction of clusters is indeed percolating is a first signature of the fact that the basic , low energies domains are highly non trivial sets of sites . when we look at @xmath44 versus @xmath45 averaged over all clusters , we see that there is a clear curvature : this is reasonable since for small clusters @xmath21 is necessarily very similar to @xmath4 . in the case of percolating clusters",
    "one sees far less of a curvature : clearly here small clusters are absent , since there is a minimal value of @xmath20 needed for percolating .    in order to proceed to a more quantitative assessment of the situation",
    "we need to go a step further .",
    "asymptotically one expects that for large volumes @xmath46 , where the over - line is for the average over the quenched disorder and @xmath47 is the exponent that characterizes the asymptotic growth .",
    "we are ignoring here sub - leading corrections since our numerical data would not allow to fit them ( we work with @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , i.e. we use three data points in each fit ) : also it turns out that the best fits to the simple form with the leading scaling behavior are very good , with low values of the @xmath51 .",
    "analogously we define the exponent @xmath52 by the rate of increase of the cluster surfaces with the volume , i.e. @xmath53 .    by fitting our numerical data we obtain the values of the exponents that we show in figure [ fig_2 ] . in the case of the ferromagnetic ising model our procedure , as applied to the magnetization - magnetization connected correlation functions , would find , for @xmath54 , finite clusters of typical size @xmath55 .",
    "we plot the values of the exponents in the two cases where we either consider all clusters , or only percolating clusters .",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "the dependence of the exponents on the value of @xmath16 is very weak : they both stay in the range @xmath56 for values of @xmath16 ranging from @xmath25 to @xmath29 . in all these cases @xmath47 and @xmath52 are very similar : their difference never exceed @xmath57 .",
    "so , to summarize , both exponents turn out to be stable as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath41 , close to the values @xmath58 and very close together .",
    "the low energy droplets in our system , at a value of the temperature deep in the broken phase , appear to have , as far as we can observe on the finite volume we can thermalize , a very diffused interface , compatible with being space filling ( namely @xmath59 ) .     and @xmath47 as a function of the correlation threshold @xmath16 , considering either all connected clusters ( bottom ) or percolating clusters only ( top).[fig_2],scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in a situation where the system is non critical we expect connected clusters to have a ( finite ) size of the order of the correlation length : survival , in the infinite volume limit , of extended clusters is a signal of criticality .",
    "such extended clusters can be defined , on a finite lattice , in many different ways : we will use here a very restrictive definition that we will denote by the word `` sponge''@xcite .",
    "we declare a connected cluster to be sponge - like if both it and at least one connected component of its complement span the whole lattice in the @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 directions .",
    "only percolating clusters contribute to sponges .",
    "we use the same cutoff @xmath30 , excluding clusters that take a too large fraction of the lattice .",
    "this applies to @xmath33 and to clusters in the complement of @xmath14 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    fraction of sponges as a function of the ( linear ) lattice size .",
    "we show in figure [ fig_3 ] the fraction of sponges as a function of the ( linear ) lattice size .",
    "we use different values of @xmath16 .",
    "we compute the fraction of sponges for a given disorder sample and we average this fraction over the random quenched disorder . the fraction of sponges is sizable ( of order @xmath63 with the very low cutoff @xmath30 ) and is never decreasing for increasing lattice size : the clear signal one gets from these numerical data is that sponges will survive in the infinite volume limit , and the typical configurations of the system will be critical .",
    "it is clear that a numerical study of this kind can not , for many reasons , give a clear cut answer , but in the very large volume range where the janus numerical simulations allow us to study equilibrium at low @xmath1 we are getting a clear hint towards survival of extended excitations ( using different values of @xmath41 would not change the picture ) : this is what one would expect in a situation where rsb holds .",
    "the same situation was found by analyzing ground states of the system in ref .",
    "here we are working at finite @xmath64 , with thermalized spin configuration .",
    "the two results are in some sense complementary : we are interested in a @xmath10 fixed point , so we would like to be at low @xmath64 , as close to @xmath10 as possible ( in principle at @xmath1 infinitesimally close to zero ) .",
    "the analysis at @xmath10 gives very interesting information , but can not exclude the possibility that @xmath10 is a point with a special behavior .",
    "last we investigate the geometrical structure of the connected clusters , trying to determine a typical correlation length : we summarize our results in figure [ fig_4 ] . for each given disorder samples",
    "we only consider the clusters that do not percolate in any direction , and select the one with the largest gyration radius : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the square distance of site @xmath67 from the center of mass of the cluster , and the sum runs over all sites of the cluster . for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath4",
    "we average @xmath68 over all disorder samples to obtain @xmath69 , that we plot , divided by @xmath70 in figure [ fig_4 ] .",
    "we plot the results for different values of @xmath16 with different symbols .",
    "@xmath71 versus @xmath70 .",
    "the correlation length @xmath69 is defined from the non percolating cluster with the largest radius.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    selecting the largest , non percolating cluster , allows us to pick up the largest physical length scale on a given finite lattice : the procedure is analogous to the one used in a normal ferromagnet to measure a physical , finite , correlation length below the critical point .    in a spin glass",
    "we have a critical temperature and all temperature values that are below it are possibly critical ( i.e. they can have an infinite correlations length ) : because of this the analysis is more delicate than in a ferromagnet , we note first that the result does not depend much on @xmath16 and @xmath41 : the emerging picture is really very stable . a constant value of @xmath71 would imply a divergence of the correlation length typical of a critical point : we observe indeed a slight increase of this ratio , that we attribute to finite size effects . again , all the signatures we are detecting call for a picture where a diverging length is determining the behavior of the system . using the non percolating cluster with the largest number of sites , instead of the one with the largest radius , does give the same kind of behavior .",
    "we have analyzed large - scale excitations of the system , estimated critical exponents , the probability of finding large excitations , and the gyration radius as an estimator of a correlation length .",
    "we have been able to work on thermalized spin configurations at low @xmath1 on large lattices ( experiments on spin glasses  @xcite show that we are working on length scales not far from the physically relevant ones ) .",
    "the emerging picture is strongly suggestive of the presence of rsb ( and compatible with a tnt scenario ) : typical excitations are large and their interface is very dense , compatible with being , in the infinite volume limit , space filling . in order to have exponents compatible with the exponents we have measured",
    ", droplets should be very different from the excitations originally proposed in the `` droplet picture ''    we thank the janus collaboration for allowing us to analyze their spin configurations .",
