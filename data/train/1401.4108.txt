    "the strong gravitational lensing has many astrophysical and cosmological applications ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein for a review ) .",
    "the qualitative understanding of the majority of multi - image configurations attributed to strong lensing can usually be based on a model of single galaxy - lens in a uniform universe .",
    "the quantitative description requires more complicated models , starting with so called _ external shear _ @xcite , invoking a galaxy cluster @xcite , or taking into account another galaxy in the lens vicinity ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the influence of the mass distribution in the lens vicinity and along the line of sight has been investigated by many authors ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to cite few ) .",
    "photometric survey of several strong lens surroundings @xcite shows that many of them lie in poor groups of galaxies and that other groups near the line of sight are not uncommon .",
    "spectroscopic observations ( @xcite , @xcite ) give the distribution of the galaxies along the line of sight and allow more detailed study of their grouping and influence on strong lensing in several cases .",
    "the inclusion of the directly observed objects around the lens in modeling greatly improves the quality of fits .",
    "@xcite investigate theoretically the problem of the main galaxy close neighbours constructing a poor group of galaxies .",
    "they check the image configurations corresponding to various source positions behind the group , different group members playing the role of the main lens , and others playing the role of the environment .",
    "they thoroughly analyze the influence of lens environment on the values of the fitted parameters .",
    "they show that by neglecting the objects around the lens one introduces bias to the fitted parameter values , which plays the role of a systematic error .",
    "in this paper we continue our investigation of the environmental and line of sight effects which influence the action of strong gravitational lenses using the results of the millennium simulation @xcite from its online database @xcite .",
    "we basically follow the approach of @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) including also the time delays in our considerations .",
    "we attempt to quantify the influence of matter in the strong lens environment ( _ env _ ) and along the line of sight ( _ los _ ) on the results of modeling multiple image configurations with measured time delays .",
    "we simulate the propagation of light in four different ways . in the most simplified approach",
    "we include only the isolated strong lens in a uniform universe model .",
    "other approaches include the lens environment , or the matter along the line of sight , or both . using each of the approaches we simulate many multiple image configurations , and attempt to fit them with the same kind of simplified model .",
    "the rate of failure ( i.e. the fraction of unsuccessful fits in each approach ) measures the influence of the environment and the line of sight ( or each of them separately ) on the strong lens .",
    "the differences between the fitted values of model parameters and the parameters used in simulations give the estimate of the systematic errors introduced by the environment and the line of sight .",

    "the multiplane approach to gravitational lensing ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) using the results of the millennium simulation @xcite and the non - singular isothermal ellipsoids ( nsie ) as models for individual halos ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is described in paper i. here we augment it with the description of relative time delays .",
    "the evolution of the matter distribution is given by the millennium _ snapshots _ which correspond to several discrete epochs with given redshifts @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that for @xmath3 the millennium cube of epoch @xmath4 adequately describes matter distribution .",
    "thus a ray crosses perpendicular layers of matter of defined thickness cut from the millennium cubes of different epochs .",
    "the cubes are randomly shifted and rotated to avoid effects of periodic boundary conditions of the simulation @xcite .",
    "since there are several matter layers between the source at @xmath5 and the observer , they can be treated as thin , and may be represented as surface mass distributions projected into their middle planes .",
    "the matter content of each cube is described as a _ background _ component representing matter density averaged on @xmath6 cells plus gravitationally bound haloes given by @xcite and @xcite . for the background",
    "we calculate the gravitational force in 3d and then use its component perpendicular to a ray to obtain the deflection angle . for ray beams with the small opening angles of @xmath7 the major influence of each background cube is an almost constant deflection angle @xmath8 plus its small variation , which we describe as the action of the background convergence @xmath9 and shear @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "( these parameters are defined for each layer separately . )",
    "each projected halo is represented as a difference between two nsie distributions with the same characteristic deflection angles @xmath12 , axis ratios @xmath13 , and position angles , but different values of core radii @xmath14 , which makes its mass finite : @xmath15 ( compare paper i ) .",
    "the above formula gives the value of characteristic deflection @xmath12 for a halo of given mass and virial radius @xmath16 .",
    "( we use @xmath14 , which validates the approximation ) .",
    "we consider axis ratios which are distributed within @xmath17 with maximum probability at @xmath18 , loosely resembling the results of @xcite .",
    "the position angles in the sky are random .",
    "since the _ background _ contains the whole mass , including mass of haloes , the latter must be compensated by some negative density distribution .",
    "we use the constant surface mass circular disk of radius @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) for this purpose ( for details see paper i ) .",
    "a compensated halo does not deflect rays outside its @xmath19 radius , so only a finite number of haloes has to be included in calculations .",
    "a ray coming to the observer from the direction @xmath21 in the synthetic sky , crosses the @xmath22-th layer ( @xmath23 ) at some position @xmath24 given as @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the angular diameter distance as measured by an observer at epoch @xmath27 to the source at epoch @xmath22 , @xmath28 - the angular diameter distance to the same source measured by a present ( @xmath29 ) observer . in calculations we use comoving distances , which in a flat cosmological model simplifies some of the expressions , but we skip these technical details here .",
    "we also apply more efficient recurrent formula of @xcite , equivalent to the above equation .    knowing the light path",
    ", one can calculate the _ geometric _ part of the relative time delay @xmath30 ( as compared with the propagation time along a null geodesics in a uniform universe model ) using the formula @xcite : @xmath31 where we consider a ray coming to the observer from the direction @xmath21 ( which defines its earlier path , so all @xmath32 are known ) and the factors @xmath33 represent time dilatation .",
    "the deflection in each layer can be calculated as a gradient of the deflection potential , which is also a measure of _ gravitational _ time delay @xmath34 @xcite : @xmath35 the potential is defined up to a constant @xmath36 .",
    "the cumulative _ gravitational _ time delay after crossing all the layers is : @xmath37 where again @xmath21 defines the path and we account for time dilatation .",
    "finally : @xmath38 the above expression contains unknown additive constant .",
    "only the difference in calculated time delays between two rays can have a clear physical meaning .",
    "our backward ray shooting covers separate and randomly chosen _",
    "maps _ in the synthetic sky @xmath39 in size . to propagate a wide beam of this size",
    "we need deflection angles in overlapping regions in all layers . for this purpose",
    "we calculate and store the deflection angles for the @xmath40 evenly spaced positions of interest in each layer .",
    "similarly we store the _ gravitational _ time delays caused by each layer . with the help of interpolations",
    "one can obtain deflections and time delays for any position in any layer .    the deflection angle and the deflection potential",
    "are given by analytical formulae and for each grid point eq .",
    "[ gradient ] holds exactly .",
    "interpolations and finite differencing used in the numerical approach make this relation approximate . to check the selfconsistency of our methods we have numerically calculated the rotation of the deflection angle on the grid , for different positions , maps , and differencing spacings .",
    "the rotation of the deflection field is present , but its level is fairly low : @xmath41 , where the averaging is over many positions within a single map .",
    "the result holds for maps at different redshifts for spacings of @xmath42 . for spacings of @xmath43",
    "the rotation is two times more important .",
    "we choose to calculate the strong lens effects in the nonuniform universe model for sources at the redshift @xmath0 .",
    "we examine all haloes within the beam up to this redshift ( typically few thousands of them ) as lens candidates estimating their einstein ring radii @xmath44 .",
    "we choose ten lenses with the largest einstein rings as most likely to produce multiple images of a randomly positioned source and investigate them in detail .",
    "when investigating multiple image properties we need zoomed maps of smaller parts of the sky . for better resolution",
    "we use finer grids with deflections interpolated from previous calculations with the help of bi - cubic spline , so the interpolated deflection derivatives are continuous .",
    "we expect the multiple images to lie within few einstein radii from the halo centre .",
    "we check for the presence of other haloes inside the circle of the radius @xmath45 surrounding a dominating lens .",
    "if they are present we enlarge the region of interest including @xmath45 zones around all companions .",
    "finally we repeat backward ray shooting inside a square on the sky overlapping the region of interest .",
    "the fine grids giving the deflection angles in consecutive layers encompass still larger areas , so one can follow majority of rays deflected off the main region .",
    "we keep control of the rays and if some of them leave the mapped region , we neglect the related lens in further considerations .",
    "we store the result of the ray shooting as a vector and scalar arrays : @xmath46 where @xmath47 gives the positions in the source plane of rays apparently coming from the directions @xmath48 on the observer s sky .",
    "similarly @xmath49 denotes the total ( gravitational plus geometric ) time delay along the ray coming from the same direction .",
    "superscripts @xmath50 , @xmath51 enumerate the rays .",
    "calculations for each ray are based on eq.(2 ) and eq .",
    "( 6 ) respectively .      to estimate the importance of the influence of the matter along the line of sight ( _ los _ ) and/or the matter in the strong lens environment ( _ env _ ) on the lensing properties , we repeat the simulations four times .",
    "the most realistic approach takes into account both _",
    "los _ and _ env_. when we take into account the action of the strong lens and neglect all other haloes belonging to the same layer , the influence of _ env _ is lost , but _",
    "los _ may still be included . in this way we check the effect of _ los _ alone .",
    "similarly , assuming that rays are deflected only in the strong lens layer ( @xmath52 for other layers ) the effect of _ env _ alone is modeled .",
    "finally using the same strong lens but in a uniform universe ( _ uni _ ) we have the clear case unaffected by neither _",
    "los _ nor _ env _ , which may be used for comparison .",
    "we use the _ prismatic transformation _",
    "@xcite in all layers making the deflection at the middle points of all maps zero and transforming the time delays accordingly .",
    "this implies that removing the background and all other haloes in the major lens plane changes the backward ray paths beyond the plane only in the second order .",
    "thus the rays in the _ los+env _ and _ los _ approaches travel through very similar surroundings and the comparison of lens modeling in these cases is sensible .",
    "the lens equation giving the dependence @xmath53 is stored in the array @xmath54 for many positions in the image plane and is sufficient for quite accurate interpolations . using numerical methods we find the distortion matrix and its determinant on the same grid , and then the critical lines and caustics .",
    "finally we find image positions for many source positions using iterative methods .",
    "( compare paper i ) .",
    "we consider only sources placed inside caustics since we are interested in multiple image configurations .",
    "the source positions are evenly spaced inside the region of interest .",
    "once the images for a given source position are found , we calculate the corresponding flux amplifications and time delays , and store all such information for further analysis .    different descriptions of light propagation produce different critical lines and caustic structures . while the positions on the observer s sky can be easily compared independently of light propagation model , the same",
    "can not be said of source positions .",
    "thus the comparison between image configurations corresponding to the same source position but obtained with different descriptions of light propagation is meaningless .",
    "only the statistical properties of image configurations corresponding to given propagation model can be compared with one another .",

    "in this paper we have followed the approach of paper i , investigating the influence of the matter along the line of sight on the properties of strong gravitational lenses .",
    "the main difference is the calculation of propagation time in the simulations and inclusion of the relative time delays in the modeling , which may serve the analysis of the hubble s constant measurement .",
    "as compared to paper i , we have simplified the treatment of the background matter distribution ( compare sec .",
    "2.1 ) , effectively replacing a part of the numerical calculation by the use of the fitted analytical formulae .",
    "this approach was not employed in paper i , so the numerical inconsistencies , measured by the rotation to shear ratio ( up to @xmath145 ) were more important and could have affected its results , exaggerating the reported influence of the matter along the line of sight on strong lensing .",
    "our numerical experiments show that matter in the immediate lens vicinity and matter along the line of sight do influence image configurations and values of fitted lens parameters .",
    "if the hubble s constant is treated as a free parameter , its fitted value also depends on the matter outside the lens .",
    "these conclusions are not new ( see e.g. @xcite ) and have been demonstrated to be true in several cases of real lenses ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . according to our results matter along the line of sight is more important than the lens immediate neighbours .",
    "this may cause problems in modeling multiple images and time delays of high redshift sources , where direct observations of the matter along the line of sight may be impossible .",
    "we consider a `` typical '' strong lens and its environment using a synthetic model of the matter distribution based on the cosmological millennium simulation @xcite with gravitationally bound haloes described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we investigate eight randomly chosen small square regions on the synthetic sky ( each @xmath146 on a side ) and look for the ten strongest lens candidates in each region , assuming that a source is located somewhere in the background at the redshift @xmath0 .",
    "we artificially remove the lens neighbours and/or matter inhomogeneities along the line of sight to compare the resulting image configurations .",
    "thus we obtain four different matter distributions with the same strong lens . to assess the importance of matter outside the lens we try to model the image configurations using a single lens in a uniform universe model . the rate of failure of this approach , as well as the spread of the fitted lens parameters serves as a measure of the influence of the matter outside the lens on its properties . inspecting table .  1",
    "one can see that ( statistically ) matter along the line of sight is more important as compared to the lens close neighbours .",
    "the same conclusion follows from inspecting figs .",
    "[ q - ratio ]  [ alfa ] , which show the distributions of fitted lens parameters .",
    "the inclusion of the time delays in modeling lowers the rate of acceptance of fits not more than 10% , despite the high postulated time measurements accuracy ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "we have introduced this accuracy requirement because many of our image configurations give time delays of the order of couple of days . for them",
    "the time delay modeling and hubble s constant fitting with more realistic @xmath148 accuracy would be meaningless .",
    "the time delay measurement accuracy we are using in our calculations is probably beyond the present observational possibilities . on the other hand one can choose appropriate lenses with appropriate image configurations for the purpose of estimating @xmath55",
    "this however goes beyond the scope of this paper , where we examine a randomly chosen lens population as a whole .    treating the value of the hubble s constant as a free parameter and using the simplified lens model with the external shear we get its median fitted value in agreement with the `` true '' value used in simulations ( compare table 2 and fig .",
    "[ hub_yes ] in sec .",
    "the convergence caused by matter outside the lens , when averaged over all our investigated cases , has median value close to zero ( sec .",
    "3.2 ) , so the bias in fitted @xmath55 values should not be pronounced .",
    "the expected convergence along a randomly chosen line of sight is zero since we measure it relative to the uniform universe model .",
    "the haloes are compensated , so for each of them the above statement is also true .",
    "since the positions of haloes in space are correlated , the density of matter near any lens should be on average increased . on the other hand , when calculating the convergence we remove the contribution of the lens itself , which is dominant .",
    "thus the external convergence value close to zero on average , as in the case of lens population investigated here , is not implausible . in a more realistic approach",
    "the convergence near the main lens should be positive due to the correlations in matter distribution . simply increasing the radii of compensating disks would not help , since the influence of each individual halo would diminish , but the number of haloes taken into account would increase in inverse proportion .",
    "one may introduce some artificial limiting radius independent of masses and take into account only lenses within such limits .",
    "we avoid such approach since the influence of high mass , distant haloes would be lost and the compensation would not be complete .",
    "( a different method of compensating mass of haloes was presented in @xcite ) .    some of the lenses give fitted hubble s constant values far from the median",
    "we have checked the accuracy of our method applying it to lenses surrounded by the uniform matter distribution and found that it gives @xmath149 per cent scatter in fitted @xmath55 .",
    "the outliers can not be explained as a result of unusually large convergence .",
    "probably the perturbations to the outliers are nonlinear and can not be modeled as the external shear and convergence .",
    "our calculations show that the external shear used in simplified modeling can be roughly estimated by weak lensing measurements along the line of sight ( compare figs .",
    "[ shear ] ,  [ example ] and eqs .",
    "[ gam1 ] ,  [ gam2 ] ) . on the other hand taking into account only galaxies visible on the sky close to the lens position ( fig .",
    "[ example ] , eqs .",
    "[ sis1 ] ,  [ sis2 ] ) may be insufficient  we have checked such estimates using lens neighbours on the sky in circles of radii up to @xmath150 and found the dependence of the results on the size of the region .",
    "it shows the important role played by the large scale structure , which is difficult to include in modeling .",
    "more sophisticated methods using spectroscopic observations of galaxies along the line of sight ( @xcite , @xcite ) may give better estimates of the external shear .",
    "in this paper we have limited our interest to configurations of four images . in five image configurations",
    "we neglect the fifth , weakest image , which is not observed in real lenses .",
    "( this is another difference in our approach as compared to paper i. ) neglecting the fifth image we loose the information related to the lens centre .",
    "the nonsingular isothermal ellipsoids we are using have small , approximately constant surface density cores .",
    "the size of the core has impact on the fifth image brightness , so without the fifth image it can not be fitted .",
    "in simulation we postulate that the core size is proportional to the lens virial radius , which defines the total mass of the lens .",
    "again , without the fifth image the total mass can not be fitted .",
    "of course the mass inside the einstein ring can still be estimated using the fitted value of characteristic deflection angle @xmath151 .",
