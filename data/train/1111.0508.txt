    "thanks to the world wide web and its hyperlinked structure , more and more information is becoming available in the form of a networked information space : a collection of information entities ( documents , scientific papers , web pages , individuals in a social network ) , connected by links between pairs of entities ( references , citations , hyperlinks , `` friend '' relationships ) . studies of various networked information spaces have given convincing evidence that a significant amount of information about the entities represented by the vertex can be derived from the graph representing the link structure .",
    "this has led to the application of graph - theoretical techniques to such graphs , with the aim of developing methods to understand the link structure and mine its information .",
    "an important step in understanding the link structure is the development of a graph model ; a stochastic process that models the link formation . the first generation of graph models was mainly aimed at explaining the graph - theoretical properties observed in real - life networks . in such models ,",
    "vertices are considered anonymous , and link formation is only influenced by the current link structure .",
    "an example is the seminal model by barabsi and albert in  @xcite based on the principle of _ preferential attachment _ : each new vertex attaches randomly to a prescribed number of existing vertices , with a link probability proportional to the degree , so vertices of high degree are more likely to receive a link from the new vertex .    in networked information spaces ,",
    "vertices are not only defined by their link environment , but also by the information entity they represent .",
    "more recently , attempts have been made to model this alternative view of the vertices through _ spatial models_. in a spatial model , vertices are embedded in a metric space , and link formation is influenced by the metric distance between vertices .",
    "the metric space is meant to be like a feature space , so that the coordinates of a vertex in this space represent the information associated with the vertex .",
    "for example , in text mining , documents are commonly represented as vectors in a word space .",
    "the metric is chosen so that metric distance represents similarity , i.e.  vertices whose information entities are closely related will be at a short distance from each other in the metric space .    in this paper , we focus on the spatial preferred attachment ( spa ) model , proposed in  @xcite , and analyze the relationship between the link structure of graphs produced by the model , and the relative positions of the vertices in the metric space .",
    "the spa model generates directed graphs according to the following principle .",
    "vertices are points in a given metric space .",
    "each vertex @xmath0 has a _ sphere of influence_. the volume of the sphere of influence of a vertex is a function of its in - degree .",
    "a new vertex @xmath1 can only link to an existing vertex @xmath0 if @xmath1 falls inside the sphere of influence of @xmath0 . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath1 links to @xmath0 with probability @xmath2 .",
    "the spa model incorporates the principle of preferential attachment , since vertices with a higher in - degree will have a larger sphere of influence . a model for on - line social networks based on similar principles",
    "can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a number of spatial models have been proposed recently  @xcite . in these models , as in the spa model , the relationship between spatial distance and link formation is determined by a threshold function : a link is possible if vertices are within a prescribed threshold distance of each other , and impossible otherwise .",
    "however , for these models the threshold distance remains constant throughout the process , and does not depend on the degree , and decrease with time , as in the spa model .",
    "a different class of graphs explores the interplay between distance and edge likelihood  with associated graph properties  with more involved mechanisms than simple thresholds : for example , in  @xcite , each new vertex is born with @xmath3 edges , each joining a neighbour with probability proportional to the in - degrees and a function of the distance between them .",
    "variations include the deterministic model  @xcite in which edges are formed based on the `` utility '' for the nodes in question , utility incorporating both in - degree and distance ; in  @xcite , the model demands that the number of nodes per unit volume is constant , and an analysis on the distribution of edge lengths is also included . beyond the creation of models ,",
    "@xcite takes a closer look at the concept of complex networks having an underlying geometry .",
    "for a recent survey of spatial models , see  @xcite .",
    "our first main result shows that , for the spa model , the number of common in - neighbours between a pair of vertices can , in many cases , be used to estimate the distance between the vertices .",
    "since the metric distance is assumed to represent the similarity or `` closeness '' of the entities represented by the vertices , this means that it is possible to estimate similarity between vertices by looking at the graph only , i.e.  without considering the underlying reality represented by the metric space .",
    "the number of common in - neighbours in a citation graph is known in library science as the measure of _ co - citation _ , and is one the earliest measures of graph - based similarity , proposed by small in 1973 in  @xcite .",
    "co - citation , and the related measure of bibliographic coupling ( from  @xcite ) based on the number of common out - neighbours , are widely used link similarity measures for scientific papers , via the citation graph , for web pages , and others  @xcite .    the question of determining similarity between vertices is one that is central to many link mining applications . it is an important tool in searching , by finding documents or web pages that are similar to a given target document .",
    "it can also be used as the basis to identify _ communities _ , or clusters , of similar vertices . a purely graph - based measure of similarity",
    "can be used as a complementary indication of similarity between vertices when other information is unreliable ( as is often the case in the world wide web ) , largely unavailable ( as in some biological networks and online social networks ) , or protected by privacy laws ( as in networks representing phone calls or bank transactions ) .",
    "our result on the relationship between number of common neighbours and metric distance is derived theoretically through an analysis of the spa model .",
    "the analytic result is asymptotic in the size of the graph . in order to test the result on realistic graph sizes , we performed simulations for graphs of 100,000 vertices , with various parameter choices .",
    "the simulations show that the real distance and the predicted distance from the number of common neighbours are in very good agreement .",
    "our second main result determines the distribution of the _ edge lengths _ , where the length of an edge is the metric distance between its end points .",
    "edge length is a metric property of a graph feature , and edge length distribution is a combined metric / graph property which is unique to spatial graph models . in the spa model ,",
    "the maximum length of an edge is determined by the size of the sphere of influence of its destination vertex , and this size is determined by the degree of the vertex . since the degrees follow a power law , we might expect that the edge length distribution follows a power law .",
    "we show , both through theoretical results and simulations , that the situation is slightly more complex .",
    "in fact , we present clear evidence that , for a certain combination of model parameters , there are three different regimes of the distribution . for the smallest edge lengths ,",
    "the cumulative edge length distribution is constant : almost all edges fall in this category . in the mid range",
    ", we have a power law with coefficient between 0 and 1 , and in the tail , we have a power law with exponent greater than 1 .    in section  2",
    ", we describe the spa model and derive some properties on the degree of a vertex which we will need to establish our results . in section  3 , we give the result on common in - neighbours and metric distance , and present the simulation results . in section  4 ,",
    "we state our theorem on edge length distribution , and present the edge length distribution as obtained through simulations for various parameters . in section  5 ,",
    "we give proofs of all the main theorems .",
    "we start by giving a precise description of the spa model , and deriving some facts about the degrees of the vertices , which we will need to prove our main results . in  @xcite",
    ", the model is defined for a variety of metric spaces @xmath4 . in this paper , we let @xmath4 be the unit hypercube in @xmath5 , equipped with the torus metric derived from any of the @xmath6 norms .",
    "this means that for any two points @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xmath4 , @xmath9 the torus metric thus `` wraps around '' the boundaries of the unit square ; this metric was chosen to eliminate boundary effects .",
    "let @xmath10 be the constant of proportionality of volume used with the @xmath3-th power of the radius in @xmath3 dimensions , so the volume of a ball of radius @xmath11 in @xmath3-dimensional space with the given metric equals @xmath12 .",
    "for example , for the euclidean metric , @xmath13 , and for the product metric derived from @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the parameters of the model consist of the _ link probability _ @xmath16 $ ] , and two positive constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the spa model generates stochastic sequences of graphs @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the in - degree of vertex @xmath0 in @xmath23 , and @xmath24 its out - degree .",
    "we define the _ sphere of influence _ @xmath25 of vertex @xmath0 at time @xmath26 to be the ball centered at @xmath0 with volume @xmath27 defined as follows : @xmath28 if the right - hand - side of ( [ above ] ) is greater than 1 .",
    "the process begins at @xmath29 , with @xmath30 being the null graph .",
    "time - step @xmath31 , @xmath26 , is defined to be the transition between @xmath32 and @xmath33 . at the beginning of each time - step @xmath31 , a new vertex @xmath34",
    "is chosen _ uniformly at random _ from @xmath4 , and added to @xmath35 to create @xmath36 .",
    "next , independently , for each vertex @xmath37 such that @xmath38 , a directed link @xmath39 is created with probability @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the probability that a link @xmath40 is added in time - step @xmath31 equals @xmath41 .",
    "we note that , to avoid the resulting graph becoming too dense , the parameters must be chosen so that @xmath42 , as explained in  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the parameters meet this condition . also , the original model as presented in  @xcite has a third parameter , @xmath43 , which is assumed to be zero here .",
    "this causes no loss of generality , since all asymptotic results presented here are unaffected by @xmath43 .",
    "we now introduce some more definitions . in the rest of the paper , unless otherwise stated we will assume all asymptotics to refer to @xmath44 going to infinity , where @xmath44 is the end time of the growth process , and thus the final size of the graph .",
    "( as explained above , theorem  [ thm : exp_degree ] is an exception . )",
    "we say that an event holds _ asymptotically almost surely _",
    "( _ a.a.s .",
    "_ ) if the probability that it holds tends to one as @xmath44 goes to infinity .",
    "similarly , we will use _ with extreme probability _ ( _ w.e.p .",
    "_ ) if the event holds with probability at least @xmath45 .",
    "thus , if we consider a polynomial number of events that each holds _ w.e.p .",
    "_ , then _ w.e.p .",
    "_  all events hold .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the spa model produces graphs with a power law degree distribution , with exponent @xmath46 . in  @xcite",
    ", the ( directed ) diameter of the model was investigated . for the results of this paper ,",
    "we need a precise expression for the expected in - degree of each vertex .",
    "[ thm : exp_degree ] let @xmath47 be any function tending to infinity together with @xmath31 .",
    "the expected in - degree at time @xmath31 of a vertex @xmath48 born at time @xmath49 is given by @xmath50    in order to simplify calculations , we make the following substitution : @xmath51 it follows immediately from the definition of the process that @xmath52 therefore , @xmath53 and so @xmath54 since all vertices start with in - degree zero , @xmath55 . since @xmath49",
    ", one can use this to get @xmath56 and the assertion follows from  ( [ eq : subst ] ) .",
    "theorem  [ thm : exp_degree ] states that the _ expected _ in - degree of an individual vertex born at time @xmath57 is asymptotically equal to @xmath58 , with an error term of order @xmath59 .",
    "( the asymptotics assume that @xmath31 is going to infinity , and @xmath57 is a growing function of @xmath31 . )",
    "however , the in - degree of an individual vertex is not concentrated around its expected value .",
    "this is due to variation happening shortly after birth ; whether or not the vertex receives in - links in the first few time steps after its birth greatly affects the size of its sphere of influence throughout the process , and therefore its final in - degree .",
    "we can circumvent this difficulty by considering the final in - degree of the vertex , and infer the growth history of the in - degree from there .",
    "namely , from the in - degree of the vertex at end time @xmath44 , we can obtain sharp bounds on the in - degree of the vertex during most of the process .",
    "this is expressed in the following theorem .",
    "first , define a injective function @xmath60 by @xmath61 so @xmath62 is the expected in - degree , at time @xmath44 , of a vertex born at time @xmath57 ( up to a multiplicative factor of @xmath63 ) .",
    "thus @xmath64 is the birth time of a vertex of final in - degree @xmath65 , had the in - degree of the vertex remained close to its expected value during its entire lifetime .",
    "moreover , the ( asymptotic ) expected in - degree at time @xmath31 of a vertex born at time @xmath57 can be given as @xmath66 ( provided that @xmath67 tends to infinity with @xmath44 ) .",
    "thus , if a vertex of final in - degree @xmath65 has in - degree growth close to its expected value , then @xmath68 will be the approximate time when that vertex has in - degree @xmath69 .",
    "the precise statement and proof of this discussion follows below in theorem  [ thm : deg ] , the main result of this section .",
    "[ thm : deg ] let @xmath70 be any function tending to infinity together with @xmath44 .",

    "_  we get a concentration around the expected value .",
    "let us mention that it seems that the @xmath77 factor is needed to get a concentration result .",
    "however , without this factor , the order of the in - degrees still can be predicted : once the vertex has @xmath78 in - neighbours , we can bound the in - degree of this vertex so that the ratio between upper and lower bounds would _ a.a.s .",
    "_  be a constant .    in order to prove theorem  [ thm : deg ]",
    ", we need strong results on the concentration of the in - degree throughout the process .",
    "these results , and the proof of the theorem , are given in section  [ proofs ] .",
    "the principles of the spa model make it plausible that vertices that are close together in space will have a relatively high number of common neighbours .",
    "namely , if two vertices are close together , their spheres of influence will overlap during most of the process , and any new vertex falling in the intersection of both spheres has the potential to become a common neighbour .",
    "thus , the number of common neighbours ( co - citation ) should lead to a reliable measure of closeness in the metric space . in this section",
    ", we will quantify the relation between spatial distance and number of common in - neighbours , and show how it can be used to estimate distance .",
    "the term  common neighbour \" here refers to common in - neighbours .",
    "precisely , a vertex @xmath79 is a common neighbour of vertices @xmath1 and @xmath0 if there exist directed links from @xmath79 to @xmath1 and from @xmath79 to @xmath0 .",
    "note that in our model this can only occur if @xmath79 is younger than @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and , at its birth , @xmath79 lies in the intersection of the spheres of influence of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "we use @xmath80 to denote the number of common in - neighbours of @xmath1 and @xmath0 at time @xmath31 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : cn ] distinguishes three cases .",
    "the division into cases is based on the trend , as shown in theorem  [ thm : deg ] , that spheres of influence tend to shrink over time .",
    "thus , once the spheres of influence of two vertices have become disjoint , and their boundaries have some distance between them , it is not likely that they will overlap at any time after that .",
    "the cases therefore are distinguished by how the spheres of influence of @xmath1 and @xmath0 overlap , and when or whether they become disjoint .",
    "figure  [ fig : cases ] gives a pictorial representation of the three cases .",
    "consider two vertices @xmath1 and @xmath0 so that @xmath0 has smaller in - degree at time @xmath44 than @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the sphere of influence of @xmath0 tends to be smaller than that of @xmath1 , and the likely birth time of @xmath1 is before that of @xmath0 .",

    "thus , they will have negligibly few common neighbours . in this case again , accurate prediction of the spatial distance between @xmath1 and @xmath0 is not possible : if @xmath1 and @xmath0 have very few common neighbours , we can only give a lower bound on their distance .    in case  2 , @xmath1 and @xmath0",
    "are so close that the sphere of influence of @xmath0 is contained within the sphere of influence of @xmath1 for almost all of its existence . in this case , the number of common neighbours of @xmath1 and @xmath0 is a constant proportion of the degree of @xmath0 , due to the fact that each new vertex linking to @xmath0 will automatically be within the sphere of influence of @xmath1 , and thus can link to @xmath1 as well ( and does so with probability @xmath2 . )",
    "this means that @xmath1 and @xmath0 are too close for accurate prediction : if @xmath81 and @xmath82 differ by a factor close to @xmath2 we can only give an upper bound on the spatial distance between @xmath1 and @xmath0 .    in case  3 , the sphere of influence of @xmath0 is contained in that of @xmath1 near the birth of @xmath0 , but the spheres become disjoint before the end of the process . the moment at which the separation occurs",

    "the three cases of this proof still hold as before ; let @xmath342 and @xmath357 be as defined in this proof . as explained in this proof , concentration for the values of @xmath345 hold only up to degree @xmath369 .",
    "this affects the computation of @xmath359 .",
    "however , in this proof we only consider the expected value of @xmath134 , so by linearity of expectation , in the computation of @xmath359 we can use the expected values of the @xmath345 .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the expected number of long edges to vertices of the first type ( case  1 ) : @xmath370 where @xmath127 is as defined in equation ( [ eqn : c ] ) .",
    "for the computation of @xmath351 , we should note that we may not have concentration of @xmath345 for the values of @xmath65 close to @xmath357 .",
    "however , we can a similar calculation to that used in the proof of theorem  [ thm : edge ] , using the expected values of the @xmath345 , to obtain that @xmath371 .    the argument that @xmath365 is negligible compared to @xmath372 and @xmath373 , as laid out in the proof of theorem  [ thm : edge ] , still holds here",
    ". thus , we have that @xmath374 the result follows by taking the logarithm .",
    "next , consider the case where @xmath375 and @xmath151 .",
    "it follows from theorem [ thm : deg ] , and it was also shown in @xcite , that _",
    ". _  the maximum in - degree in a graph produced by the spa model is at most @xmath376 . since @xmath377 , _",
    "w.e.p . _  no vertices are in case  1 , so no vertices can receive long edges until the edge of the process .    for the vertices that are in case 2",
    ", we can apply the same calculation as in the proof of theorem  [ thm : edge ] , while taking the expected values of the @xmath345 as in the previous case .",
    "_  @xmath378 is an upper bound on the maximum degree , the expected number of vertices of degree greater than @xmath378 is at most @xmath379 .",
    "hence , the expected number of long edges to such vertices , is at most @xmath380 .",
    "the expected number of long edges to vertices of the second type ( case  2 ) therefore is equal to @xmath381 for a lower bound on @xmath373 , we should sum over @xmath382 .",
    "since @xmath383 , as before the exponent of @xmath65 in the summation is determined by its upper bound @xmath384 .",
    "this leads to @xmath385 for some function @xmath386 of order @xmath387 .",
    "for the lower bound on @xmath373 , we have the same summation , but with upper bound @xmath388 instead of @xmath378 , and thus @xmath389 .",
    "finally , consider the vertices in case 3 . here ,",
    "the exact same argument as given in the proof of theorem  [ thm : edge ] can be used to show that @xmath392 since this is of smaller order than @xmath373 , the result follows .    finally , consider the case where @xmath393 .",
    "for @xmath394 we have the exact same expression for @xmath372 as for the case where @xmath161 , as given in equation ( [ eqn : e(e1 ) ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath395 where the last step follows since @xmath396        since @xmath159 , the exponent of @xmath65 in the summation in this case is determined by its lower bound @xmath404 this leads to @xmath405 where the last step follows since the exponent of @xmath406 in @xmath407 equals @xmath408      for the lower bound , note that all volumes of influence up to time @xmath411 have ( deterministically ) volume at least @xmath412 .",
    "therefore , a positive fraction of all edges generated until time @xmath211 are long , and so _ a.a.s . _  @xmath413 is a lower bound for the number of long edges and the theorem is finished .",
