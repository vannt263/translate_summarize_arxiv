    "while there has been substantial progress in understanding the molecular basis of structural organization of chromatin at smaller scales , a statistical description of the 3-dimensional ( 3d ) organization at large scales has until recently proved a challenge .",
    "studies of interphase chromatin architecture using fish and hi - c techniques on a scale of a megabase in three different systems , human  @xcite , mouse  @xcite and drosophila chromosome 3r  @xcite , have now provided striking and consistent results on the statistics of packing and looping , such as ( i ) the `` size '' of the chromosome measured by its radius of gyration @xmath0 , where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the number of base pairs ) , i.e. , over the largest scale chromatin is compact , ( ii ) the `` size '' of the chromatin over a contour length @xmath3 , also scales as @xmath4 , with the same @xmath5 , suggesting that at scales beyond @xmath6 the chromatin is self - similar and compact , and ( iii ) the contact probability @xmath7 is independent of the nucleotide sequence but dependent of its state of activity ( thus euchromatin and heterochromatin display different loop statistics ) , with @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "these statistical properties are clearly inconsistent with an _ equilibrium globule _",
    "@xcite ; the proposal was that the statistics of these conformations could be described by a self - similar , space filling , _ fractal _ or _ crumpled _ polymer  @xcite .",
    "these statistical features do not appear to be entirely universal - in human embryonic stem ( es ) cells , the chromatin is more swollen and the measured contact probability is closer to @xmath10  @xcite .    taken together , these studies reinforce the claim that chromatin folding at large scales is a problem in polymer physics , as was recognized by  @xcite .",
    "this has naturally provoked the question - what are the physical forces or processes that give rise to such a statistical description of the ` chromatin polymer ' at large scales ? a recent review  @xcite summarizes the existing polymeric models proposed to explain this 3d chromatin architecture .",
    "models based on purely equilibrium forces arising from polymer elasticity and interactions with dna - binding proteins  @xcite , show the spontaneous formation of chromosome co - localization and looping and territory formation via the establishment of ` bridging ' proteins at two or more chromosomal sites .",
    "these models may however be relevant to chromatin looping at scales much smaller than those probed by hi - c , as argued in  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand ,  @xcite propose that the crumpled polymer configuration is a result of a fast collapse of the chromatin structure whose relaxation to an equilibrium globule configuration is hindered by topological or steric constraints of the long polymer in a crowded nuclear environment . here , we show that the observed 3d conformations arise naturally by modeling chromatin as an active semiflexible , self - avoiding polymer confined within the nucleus .",
    "nuclear chromatin is subject to _ active _ stresses from binding / unbinding of a variety of chromatin - remodeling proteins ( crps )  @xcite , leading to the local release of histones . in this paper , we include the mechanochemistry of the crps and study the rouse dynamics  @xcite of the chromatin using a coarse - grained dynamical monte carlo simulation . for the active polymer in 3d , we recover the statistical features reported in the hi@xmath11c experiments for mammalian chromosomes , both in differentiated and es cells .",
    "interestingly , hi - c studies of the yeast chromatin  @xcite , showed a different scaling , _",
    "viz_. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and have been taken to be consistent with an equilibrium globule .",
    "rather than interpret the yeast chromatin as following different folding principles , we ask whether this statistical behavior appears as a solution of the same folding strategy as the other cell types investigated ; this is consistent with the suggestion that there may be many global attractors on any realistic chromatin folding landscape  @xcite . in this spirit , we find that the same active chromatin model can be made to work for the yeast chromosome too , if we recognize that in these model organisms each chromosome has a centromere attachment and chromosome ends ( telomere regions ) are preferentially located next to the nuclear envelope  @xcite .",
    "such multiple attachment sites will put significant constraints on the excursions of the polymer in configuration space , which in the extreme limit , is equivalent to an effective reduction in spatial dimensionality . as we will see , the active polymer in 2d",
    "recapitulates the statistical features of yeast chromatin .",
    "the present study should be viewed as part of a growing body of work that recognises the relevance of active processes in the rheology  @xcite and organization  @xcite of nuclear matter at different scales .",
    "the hi - c experiments revealed the statistics of organization of nuclear chromatin on the scale of around @xmath14 mb  @xcite , with a resolution of 1 mb . over this scale ,",
    "it is appropriate to treat the enclosed chromatin as a coarse - grained semiflexible polymer , where each `` monomer '' is taken to comprise a group of around @xmath15 neighboring nucleosomes or @xmath16kbp of dsdna  @xcite . for a statistical description of chromatin over large scales ,",
    "the arrangement of nucleosomes within each coarse - grained monomer and the sequence dependence of the polymer should be irrelevant .",
    "to a first approximation therefore , the coarse - grained chromatin is a semiflexible homopolymer with interactions between monomers , nuclear solvent , and confining surfaces or anchoring to specific substrates .",
    "monomer - monomer interactions include steric and bending interactions .",
    "confinement is imposed by a constraint on the enclosed volume @xmath17 ( in 3d ) , the lagrange multiplier fixing this constraint is the pressure , @xmath18 . as discussed above , chromatin may also be subject to constraints due to anchoring to substrates . in such cases ,",
    "the conformations explored by chromatin would be considerably restricted  in the extreme limit of very strong anchoring to a 2d substrate it is reasonable to model it as an effective polymer embedded in 2d .",
    "in addition to being subject to thermodynamic forces from polymer elasticity , the chromatin is driven out - of - equilibrium by the binding and unbinding of atp - dependent crps .",
    "chromatin is tightly bound to histones : single - molecule studies have estimated that the histone - chromatin unbinding energy scales are of order @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the binding of the atp - dependent crps generate local active stresses leading to the release of histones from the chromatin .",
    "the isotropic part of the active stresses contribute to an osmotic pressure , which extrudes the fluid through the polymeric gel .",
    "in addition , the bound crps generate anisotropic active stresses - force dipoles - whose normal and tangential components affect polymer bend and stretch ( compression ) conformations . normal stresses result in local bending of the polymer , while tangential stresses result in a local stretch via the release of a few histones .",
    "conversely , when histones bind to naked dna , they locally compress the chromatin length .",
    "let us assume that a length @xmath20 is added when the action of the crp releases a group of histones ( or subtracted when a group of histones bind to chromatin ) .",
    "the crp - histone complex are thus _ strain _ ( both bend and stretch ) _",
    "generators_. since strain generators are also _ strain sensors _ , the binding - unbinding kinetics of crps should be dependent on the local curvature and stretch . this mechano - chemical ( un)binding process , shown in fig.1b ,",
    "may be represented as @xmath21 crp$_b$ + chr ->[+\\text{atp}][-\\text{hist } ] crp$_u$ + chr$^+$}\\ ] ] @xmath22[+\\text{hist } ] chr$^-$}\\ ] ] where chr represents chromatin whose local state of bend and stretch is taken as reference , chr@xmath23 represents chromatin which is locally stretched ( compressed ) with respect to the reference , by an amount @xmath20 due to the loss ( gain ) of a group of histones , and the subscripts @xmath24 and @xmath25 refer to the bound and unbound crp . the rate @xmath26 depend on the local state of the chromatin , namely its bend and stretch . since changes in the local strain of chromatin",
    "is felt at larger scales , both the effective `` forward '' and `` backward '' reactions are mechano - chemical and involve energy consumption .",
    "we study the dynamics of the active chromatin using a simple dmc simulation , where the chromatin elasticity is modeled by a kratky - porod model  @xcite , a freely jointed chain of @xmath2 beads of diameter @xmath27 , interconnected by tethers , whose length is constrained by @xmath28 to ensure self - avoidance  @xcite , and is described by the energy , e = _ i=1^n ( 1- * t*_i _ i+1 ) l_i , [ kratskyporod ] where @xmath29 is the bending rigidity ( in units of k@xmath30 t ) .",
    "the tangent vector , @xmath31 is the unit vector from the @xmath32 bead to its nearest neighbor @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the length of the vector , in units of @xmath35 , from the bead at @xmath33 to @xmath36 .",
    "the effective rigidity @xmath29 of the coarse - grained chromatin is around @xmath37  @xcite , higher than the bare dna due to large steric interactions and the tight winding around histones .",
    "we model confinement by a constraint on the enclosed volume @xmath17 ( in 3d ) , the lagrange multiplier fixing this constraint is the pressure , @xmath18 .    the mechano - chemical reactions discussed above are implemented in the dmc by adding and removing beads followed by re - tethering the polymer  addition of a bead is equivalent to the `` forward '' reaction , while removal of a bead is equivalent to the `` backward '' reaction .    we summarize the dmc moves : ( i ) choose a particle and displace it within a small box of size @xmath38 around its old position , keeping the connectivity the same .",
    "the displacement is accepted using the metropolis scheme  @xcite , with the probability for acceptance given by , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the inverse temperature and @xmath41 is the change in the energy through eq.([kratskyporod ] ) .",
    "we define a dmc time step ( mcs ) as @xmath2 attempts to displace the particles .",
    "( ii ) remove or add a particle with rates that depend on the local curvature and projected density .",
    "these active moves are attempted @xmath42 times every mcs and is followed by reconnection .",
    "we briefly describe the active moves to set notation , for details , ( _ supplementary information , secs.s2(a - c ) _ ) . a bead is added ( removed ) to ( from ) a randomly chosen location on the polymer with probability , & p_+= , & [ eqn : probadd ] + & p_-= . [",
    "eqn : probrem ] & where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are , respectively , the energy cost to add and remove from regions of unit positive curvature on the polymer , and could be thought of as a chemical potential . @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the curvatures that determine the chemical potentials for addition and removal of beads at the chosen location ( _ supplementary information , sec.s1 _ ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 controls the fluctuation of the number of particles about the expected value @xmath48 , and is chosen to be high @xmath49 , so as to get rms fluctuations less than 10% ( _ supplementary information , fig.s8 _ ) .",
    "the addition and removal of monomeric units on the polymer is accepted subject to fulfillment of the tether and self avoidance constraints .",
    "it is easy to see that these transition probabilities do not obey the detailed balance condition , p(n)p_+(nn+1 ) p(n+1)p_-(n+1n ) , when @xmath50 , reflecting the non - equilibrium feature of the process . here",
    ", @xmath51 is the probability to chose a vertex from a system containing @xmath2 vertices .",
    "the transition probabilities shown in eqns . and are purely non - equilibrium and detailed balance is satisfied when @xmath52 .",
    "we implement the dmc in both 2 and 3 dimensions ; as discussed earlier the former corresponds to the conformations explored by chromatin when strong anchored to a two dimensional substrate . in any case",
    ", we will use the 2d model to show that it reproduces well known results in appropriate limits .",
    "we first check that in the absence of addition and removal of beads or when the removal and addition maintains detailed balance , @xmath52 , we recover the equilibrium phase diagram of a closed semiflexible polymer in 2-dimensions in the canonical and the grand canonical ensembles , respectively ( _ supplementary information , sec.s2(d - h ) _ ) .",
    "we then restore full activity and vary the parameters , @xmath53 , @xmath29 and @xmath18 to obtain a phase diagram in @xmath54 , fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia](a ) .",
    "we perform various tests to confirm that these structures are indeed true steady states of an active polymer ( _ supplementary information , sec.s2(i - j ) _ ) .",
    "when the bending rigidity @xmath29 is small such that the polymer size is larger than the persistence length , it behaves like a self - avoiding random walker ( saw ) , showing fluctuations at the smallest scales .",
    "as we increase @xmath29 , these small scale fluctuations get ironed out  at @xmath55 , the active semi - flexible polymer shows _ loop - on - loop _ structures ( fig.[fig : phasedia](b ) ) .",
    "the final conformation of the polymer does not depends on its initial state .",
    "one of our predictions is that the looped structure is formed only beyond a critical bending rigidity @xmath56 for a fixed value of @xmath2 and activity .",
    "further , for fixed @xmath29 and activity , looped structures are obtained for large enough @xmath2 .",
    "we find it difficult to arrive at a systematic classification of shapes and hence a phase diagram in @xmath57 . even so it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia](c ) , that the 3d conformations show a tendency to form correlated fibril - like structures @xcite .",
    "we now turn to a study of the statistical properties of the active polymer at steady state in both @xmath54 and @xmath58 .",
    "we analyze the scaling behaviour of the radius of gyration ( @xmath59 ) for an active semiflexible polymer , with linear and ring topologies , with respect to polymer size @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the active semiflexible polymer is _ compact _ with its radius of gyration scaling as @xmath60 , with @xmath61 in 2d and @xmath1 in 3d ( fig.[fig : rg - denden](a ) ) .",
    "as control , we verify that we recover the scaling behaviour of an equilibrium self - avoiding polymer when the activity is switched off ( fig.[fig : rg - denden](a ) ) .",
    "we note that the statistics obtained in the case of ring polymers is especially clean ( data not shown ) .",
    "we also verify that every subchain of sufficiently long polymer is collapsed , i.e. , a fit to @xmath62 , for @xmath3 , shows that @xmath61 and @xmath63 , in @xmath54 and @xmath58 , respectively ( fig.[fig : rg - denden](a ) ) . thus the polymer starts becoming compact at a value of @xmath64 significantly smaller than the confinement scale ( or the size of the polymer ) , a finding that appears consistent with recent fish experiments  @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to the natural tendency of the active polymer to form multiple loops .",
    "we compute the monomer density correlation @xmath65 of the active , self - avoiding , semi - flexible polymer in 2d and 3d , for both linear and ring topologies ( fig.[fig : rg - denden](b ) ) . for the equilibrium polymer , the value of @xmath66 at which the density correlator peaks is roughly set by the persistence length , @xmath67 .",
    "in contrast , for the active polymer , the peak of the density correlation is at smaller @xmath66 and is set by activity .",
    "this scale @xmath68 is related to the loop - size that we discuss next .",
    "the structure factor @xmath69 , the fourier transform of the density correlation , also shows distinct features of activity .",
    "we focus on the form of the structure factor at intermediate wave vector scales , @xmath70 . for the active polymer in 2d",
    ", we find that @xmath71 ; whereas for the 3d active polymer , @xmath72 ( fig.[fig : rg - denden](c ) and _ supplementary information , fig.s14 _ ) . this is consistent with the predicted behaviour of the fractal or crumpled polymer  @xcite .",
    "the most significant result from the recent hi - c experiments  @xcite is that the probability of contact and loop formation of human interphase chromatin is distinct from an equilibrium polymer .",
    "here we show that the active polymer in 3d shows a contact statistics that has the same scaling behaviour as that reported in  @xcite .",
    "the contact probability density @xmath73 , is defined as the probability to find two coarse grained beads , separated along the polymer contour by @xmath64 , to be at a spatial ( geometric ) distance @xmath74 ( _ supplementary information , fig.s15 _ ) .",
    "the heat map for @xmath73 computed for both equilibrium and active polymers are shown in the _ supplementary information , fig.s16_. the equilibrium polymer with finite @xmath29 shows a band like structure implying the lack of any long range contact , with a spread that increases with lowering @xmath29 . in spite of its diffuse nature",
    "we observe reasonable contact density only for small values of the contour length @xmath75 which indicates the absence of any order promoting long range contacts .",
    "in contrast , the contact probability density for an active polymer shows finite contact density for beads separated by contour length @xmath76 indicating the presence of compactness and order .",
    "we first determine the loop size distribution @xmath77 of the active polymer , defined as the probability for two coarse grained beads , separated by @xmath64 , to form a loop like structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : loopsize](a ) , and also see _ supplementary information , fig.s18 _ for details ) .",
    "our simulations of the active semiflexible polymer in 2d , seem to suggest that there is a typical loop size , which is independent of the size of the polymer , and dependent on activity . in 3d , however , the loop size distribution is very broad at the peak and overlaps with the region where the contact probability @xmath78 ( to be defined below ) shows an exponential cutoff , making it difficult to ascribe a typical loop size .",
    "we note that the steady state loops of the active polymer are dynamic , although its movement is suppressed by topological constraints and viscosity .",
    "we next study the scaling behaviour of the contact probability @xmath79 for the active semiflexible self - avoiding polymer in 2 and 3 dimensions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : loopsize](b ) ) .",
    "as control , we first display the contact probability of the equilibrium self - avoiding polymer . in 2d ,",
    "the contact probability exhibits a power - law decay with @xmath80 , where @xmath81 at large enough @xmath64 . the value of this contact exponent is in excellent agreement with the exact theoretical value of @xmath82 obtained using conformal invariance  @xcite .",
    "note that the probability of contact is very nearly zero , for scales smaller than the persistence length , @xmath83 . in 3d",
    ", the contact probability for the equilibrium polymer also decays as a power law with an exponent @xmath84 . recall that the contact exponent for a gaussian polymer is @xmath85 in @xmath86-dimensions . for an active semiflexible self - avoiding polymer",
    ", however , one obtains loops at scales smaller than @xmath67 , and it is only below scales corresponding to @xmath87 ( set by activity ) that the contact probability is zero  at larger scales @xmath88 we find that @xmath80 , with @xmath13 ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath57 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : loopsize](b ) ) .",
    "the scaling of the contact probability in 3d is in excellent agreement with the hi - c data of interphase chromatin in mammalian cells  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the contact exponent has been reported to be @xmath13 in human es  to explain this , we recognise that the chromatin in es cells are transcriptionally very active and show large fluctuations and lower percentage of compact heterochromatin regions .",
    "this we argue corresponds to setting @xmath89 in our active chromatin model  our simulations then show that @xmath13 ( inset , fig .",
    "[ fig : loopsize](b ) ) .",
    "as we argued , the contact statistics of chromatin in yeast cells should more closely resemble the statistics of the active polymer in @xmath54 .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that the space - filling , fractal polymer is a solution of the optimal folding of a polymer that is confined and constrained to be in a knot free state .",
    "unfortunately our algorithm to generate the active dynamics ( the dual description ) uses non - topological moves of monomer addition and removal and polymer reconnection .",
    "the resulting knottedness , which we verify using the knots server ( http://knots.mit.edu  @xcite ) , is entirely an artifact of our algorithm .",
    "we expect that we can make local remedial moves on this steady state conformation to anneal the knots without changing the statistical features of the active polymer , such as @xmath90 and @xmath78 .",
    "notwithstanding , the topological constraints and the smooth dynamics of the active polymer would ensure a knot free steady state when the initial condition is knot free , both for a closed polymer and a long enough linear polymer  @xcite .",
    "being a compact globule even at scales smaller than the confinement scale , there is topological repulsion between two non - concatenated active polymer rings .",
    "however , pressure from confinement of a bunch of nonconcatenated ring polymers can result in a degree of intermingling , which can be modulated by having an intervening stretch of inactive chromatin of length @xmath91 ( `` euchromatin '' , see _ supplementary information , fig.s19 _ ) .",
    "this lack of intermingling and entanglement of active polymers is consistent with recent observations  @xcite .",
    "one way to check if activity is the driver of in - vivo chromatin folding at large scales , is to switch off the effects of activity , either by atp depletion or by perturbing the activity of chromatin remodeling proteins ( as in  @xcite ) , and monitor the ensuing dynamical changes .",
    "we carry out this protocol in our simulations , i.e. , starting from the steady state of the active polymer , we monitor the dynamics of conformational changes upon switching off activity .",
    "we find that the polymer very quickly evolves to a more swollen conformation , with the conformational statistics of an equilibrium self - avoiding polymer ( _ supplementary information , fig.s3 _ ) .",
    "this would suggest that the nuclear volume should increase upon reducing or switching off activity , consistent with the findings reported in @xcite .",
    "we have seen how the statistics of the steady state conformations of a semiflexible self - avoiding polymer subject to active stresses replicates the observed statistical features of interphase chromatin at a megabase scale as reported by the recent hi - c data  @xcite .",
    "this might suggest that active stress generation together with topological constraints are important ingredients in driving chromatin folding at large scales .",
    "we find that hierarchical looping appears as a natural outcome of activity and semiflexibility , and does not necessarily require the engagement of specialized bridging or linker proteins , although these play important roles in stabilizing specific loop regions and regulating their dynamics and territorial segregation .",
    "it is encouraging to us that this active chromatin model shows reasonably good agreement with the hi - c results on the statistics of packing and contact .",
    "in addition , it makes many predictions such as , ( i ) the scaling of the structure factor , @xmath72 , ( ii ) the broadness of the probability distribution of loop sizes @xmath77 , and ( iii ) the low stiffness of active chromatin in es cells .    based on our numerical evidence and the simulation results of  @xcite ,",
    "we make two further observations regarding the conformations of the active polymer ",
    "( i ) in two dimensions , we find that the statistics of the active semi - flexible self - avoiding polymer is the same as that of the space - filling peano ( or hilbert ) curves , and ( ii ) in three dimensions , we find that the statistics of the active semi - flexible self - avoiding polymer is the same as that of the space - filling _ interdigitating _ peano curve . indeed in 2d ,",
    "the similarity between the typical loop - on - loop conformation of the active polymer ( fig.[fig : phasedia](b ) ) and hilbert curves is quite striking .",
    "space - filling peano or hilbert curves often come up in spatial ordering of data structures or in the design of optimal data storage in computer science .",
    "typical database applications require multi - attribute indexing , which involves mapping points from a multidimensional space into one dimension in a way that preserves spatial `` locality '' _ as much as possible_. locality implies points that are close together in multi - dimensional attribute space are also close together in the one - dimensional space  @xcite .",
    "this kind of mapping is important in assigning physical storage to minimize access effort  @xcite .",
    "it appears from many studies that by ordering data along space - filling curves , such as peano or hilbert curves , one best achieves this goal .",
    "given that the statistical properties of the conformation of interphase chromatin is the same as space filling peano or hilbert curves , it is tempting to conjecture that this folding architecture optimizes information storage and access , by co - locating gene loci with shared transcription resources within loops .",
    "this appears consistent with very recent high resolution hi - c studies , which studies the interplay between chromatin looping and gene - loci contacts @xcite .",
    "optimizing information processing can not come for free , and it is appealing that in the model of active chromatin folding this is a consequence of driving the system out - of - equilibrium by energy consuming processes .",
    "it would be interesting to explore these ideas in studies combining such high resolution metrical studies with gene expression data .",
