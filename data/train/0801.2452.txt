    "many single - cloud weak absorbers ( @xmath2(2796 ) @xmath3 0.3 ) at 0.4 @xmath7 @xmath0 @xmath7 1.0 have been found to have solar or even super - solar metallicities @xcite .",
    "this is quite puzzling in view of the fact that they tend to be found at distances of 40 ",
    "100  kpc from star - forming galaxies @xcite , and not near detected sites of star formation .",
    "these objects have a cross - section similar to the absorption cross section of luminous galaxies , thus they occupy a significant volume of the universe @xcite . because weak systems only contain a small mass , they do not trace the cosmic metal abundance , however , it is still important to understand local star - formation activities in the full range of environments over cosmic time .",
    "@xcite presented the results of a search for weak absorption in vlt / uves quasar spectra over a cumulative redshift path of 77.3 at 0.4 @xmath7 @xmath0 @xmath7 2.4 . a total of 116 absorbers with 0.02 @xmath7 @xmath10 @xmath7 0.3    were detected , with @xmath1 60% of these having just a single - cloud , narrow component in .",
    "it has been argued that a large fraction of the population of multiple - cloud weak absorbers ( i.e. , absorbers with multiple - clouds , which are resolved by high - resolutional ( @xmath4 @xmath1 40,000 ) spectroscopies ) have a different physical origin from the single - cloud weak absorbers @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the redshift path density , @xmath11 , of weak absorbers increases from @xmath0 @xmath5 2.4 to @xmath0 @xmath5 1.2 , where it peaks , and subsequently declines until the present .",
    "the paper of @xcite followed a weak survey of @xcite , which used a small subset of high quality vlt / uves quasar spectra . from that survey , @xcite selected the nine @xmath0 @xmath12 1.4 weak absorbers and applied photo - ionization models . of these , four were single - cloud weak absorbers with coverage of the corresponding ly@xmath9  transitions so that metallicities could be constrained .    in general",
    ", @xcite found that the physical conditions of the @xmath0 @xmath12 1.4 weak absorbers were similar to those of the same class of absorbers at lower redshift , suggesting that the same production mechanisms are responsible over this time period .",
    "however , in contrast to the situation at low redshift @xcite , @xcite were only able to derive lower limits to the metallicity , ranging from 1/100@xmath13  1/10@xmath13 of the solar value .",
    "single - cloud weak absorbers , in addition to the cloud that produced the absorption , have separate , lower density clouds that are spread over tens to hundreds of  @xcite .",
    "the reason that only lower limits could be derived for the metallicity in these cases was because of the contributions to the ly@xmath9  profile from the kinematically spread clouds . on the other hand , @xcite also suggested that there could be a build - up of metals in the population of single - cloud weak absorbers from @xmath0 @xmath1 2 to @xmath0 @xmath1 0.4 .    in view of the large spread of metallicity constraints at any redshift ,",
    "a sample of only four @xmath0 @xmath12 1.4 single - cloud weak absorbers was not sufficient to resolve the issue of whether metallicity evolution occurs in the population .",
    "we therefore identified three additional @xmath0 @xmath12 1.4 candidates for photo - ionization modeling from the larger survey of @xcite .",
    "these systems , the @xmath0 @xmath5 1.78169 absorber toward he  0141@xmath63932 , the @xmath0 @xmath5 1.68079 absorber toward he  0429@xmath64091 , and the @xmath0 @xmath5 1.75570 absorber toward he  2243@xmath66031 , have high @xmath14-ratio vlt / uves coverage of key constraining metal - line transitions , as well as ly@xmath9 .",

    "in this section we briefly summarize the strategy for photoionization modeling , which is similar to the procedure practiced in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . at first , we determine the line parameters ( column density , doppler parameter , and redshift ) for the doublets , using a voigt profile fitting code ( minfit ; @xcite ) .",
    "for each of the three absorbers modeled here , a single absorption component provided an adequate fit to the doublet .",

    "we emphasize , however , that we did not use these values ( except for the optimized transitions ) to determine model constraints .",
    "instead we compared directly to the shapes of the observed absorption profiles as described below .",
    "assuming that the absorbing clouds are in photoionization equilibrium , their ionization conditions are derived using the photoionization code cloudy , version 07.02.00 @xcite , optimizing on the observed column density of and comparing model predictions to other observed low ionization transitions .",
    "the clouds in each phase are modeled as plane - parallel structures of constant density .",
    "the ionization parameter ( @xmath8 @xmath5 @xmath22 $ ] ) and metallicity ( @xmath23 ) of the clouds serve as free parameters in the modeling . the elemental abundance pattern is initially assumed to be solar , and variations are explored when they are suggested by the data .    following @xcite , we take the combined flux from quasars and star forming galaxies at @xmath24 ( with a photon escape fraction of 0.1 ) as an extragalactic background radiation ( i.e. , incident flux on the absorbers )",
    ". we will consider the possible effects of a nearby stellar contribution to the ionizing radiation field in ",
    "[ sec : assumptions ] , although it should be safe to ignore them , since weak absorbers are not often within 40  kpc of bright galaxies @xcite",
    ".    the metallicity and ionization parameter are initially varied in steps of 0.5 dex , and then fine - tuned to select the model that corresponds best with the observed data in steps of 0.1 dex .",
    "the column densities for various ionization stages of each element and the equilibrium gas temperature are provided by the cloudy model .",
    "the doppler parameter for each element can then be calculated from the expression for total line width , @xmath25 @xmath5 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 , where @xmath29 ( @xmath5 @xmath30 ) is the thermal contribution to the line width corresponding to a gas temperature @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the contribution from internal gas turbulence .",
    "this latter quantity , which is uniform across elements , is estimated using the gas temperature from the cloudy model and the observed doppler parameter of the element on which the model is optimized . from the derived column densities and doppler parameters ,",
    "a synthetic spectrum is generated and compared to the observed spectrum after convolving with a gaussian instrumental spread function ( @xmath4 @xmath5 45,000 in the case of our vlt / uves spectra ) .",
    "although the observed and the synthesized spectra are compared `` by eye '' , the method generally gives good results in the sense that other models whose metallicity and ionization parameter are ( sometimes only slightly ) different than the best values would make the model spectrum deviate greatly from the observed spectrum .",
    "it is not practical to apply formal procedures to assess the quality of fit because of the effect of blends and data defects on a @xmath33 statistic .",
    "if all transitions of a certain element are over / under - produced compared to the observed spectrum in the best model , we consider a specific abundance pattern for the system .",
    "our method is illustrated for a specific example , the @xmath34   cloud for the @xmath35 system toward he0141 - 3932 ( system 1 ) in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "we show , for this component , that only values within the range @xmath36 and within 0.1  dex of @xmath37 produce acceptable fits to ly@xmath9 , , and , which are the main constraints for this case .    usually",
    ", low - ionization phase clouds that produce the absorption lines also produce other low - ionization transitions such as , , , and .",
    "however , the higher - ionization transition , , and sometimes intermediate - ionization transitions such as are not fully produced by the clouds .",
    "therefore , once we find the best model for the clouds , we repeat a similar cloudy analysis for the clouds . for the high - ionization phase ,",
    "multiple components are sometimes required to fit absorption lines detected at different velocities .",
    "the results of voigt profile fits to these components are also listed in table  [ tab3 ] . finally , the combined models , with contributions from both low- and high - ionization phases , are compared to the observed spectrum .",
    "since ly@xmath9  absorption lines have contributions from both the low- and high - ionization phases , determination of metallicities for the low- and high - ionization phases can be degenerate .",
    "however , in the three single - cloud weak absorbers that we are considering , it is possible to place limits on metallicity of both phases , so as not to over - produce the ly@xmath9  absorption .",
    "also , in some cases , models with high metallicity ( leading to low temperatures ) can be favored when comparing model profiles to some observed low ionization transitions .",
    "for photoionization models , our procedure is adjusted for each system based on the available constraints in various transitions .",
    "some transitions are blended with other lines , and others may be saturated .",
    "these issues are considered carefully during photoionization modeling . in this section",

    "we can place strong constraints on metallicity and ionization parameter because multiple transitions ( including ly@xmath9 ) have been detected in high s / n - ratio regions of the spectra ( see figures  [ fig1 ]  [ fig3 ] ) .",

    "we therefore are confident in applying the as a constraint .",
    "rest - frame equivalent widths and @xmath20 equivalent width limits are listed in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "although the ly@xmath9  profile is complex , it provides a very strong constraint on metallicity because the flux at the position of the component centered on begins to recover on its blue side , which enables us to fit this component of ly@xmath9  effectively . all transitions except for high - ionization lines such as and have only single components detected .",

    "if dust depletion was important , the lower limit on metallicity would be increased .",
    "in addition to the cloud , three more higher - ionization clouds are needed to reproduce the three detected components , the two components , and the right wing of the ly@xmath9  profile .",
    "there are no lines detected , which is useful to place an upper limit on the ionization parameter .",

    "the metallicity of the can not be well - constrained directly from comparison to the ly@xmath9  because the kinematical spread of the lines give rise to a large ly@xmath9  equivalent width , however near solar metallicities are possible , and even favored for a solar abundance pattern .",
    "also , the blueward cloud will over - produce absorption in ly@xmath9unless its metallicity is @xmath39 @xmath12 @xmath61.1 .",
    "a separate , offset low - metallicity component was again needed to fit the red portion of the ly@xmath9  profile .",
    "system  3 has the best metallicity constraint among the seven single - cloud weak absorbers at @xmath0 @xmath12 1.5 because of the absence of offset components , thereby keeping the ly@xmath9profile very narrow .",
    "two phases are still required , with clouds of different ionization parameters centered at the same velocity that produce both the narrower low - ionization transitions , and the broader high - ionization transitions .",
    "both the low- and the high - ionization phases are constrained to have solar or super - solar metallicities .",
    "the most striking thing about these model results , is that in all three @xmath0 @xmath1 1.7 systems , the metallicity of at least one phase of gas is constrained to be greater than one tenth the solar value .",
    "the three systems all have at least two phases of gas : the low ionization phase that arises in a layer of gas @xmath11  100  pc thick with a density of 0.001  0.1  , and the high ionization phase that comes from a larger region ( @xmath1 0.1  10  kpc ) with a lower density . for these systems ,",
    "even metallicities of the larger high - ionization phase regions range from one tenth solar up to solar .",
    "we will return to a discussion of the surprising issue of how regions with @xmath46  @xmath7 15 ( i.e. , over a million times less than the threshold for star formation ) can be enriched in metals to the solar value .",

    "figure  [ fig6 ] presents quantities derived from photoionization models , for our three absorbers and for others taken from the literature , using the same methods as we have used here @xcite .",
    "the specific constraints that are displayed in figures  [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] are also listed in table  [ tab7 ] , with the relevant references .",
    "@xcite derived similar constraints for the phase structure of four different single - cloud weak absorbers at @xmath0 @xmath1 1.7 .",
    "they also placed constraints on the metallicities of those absorbers , of @xmath39 @xmath12 @xmath61.5 , @xmath12 @xmath61.5 , @xmath12 @xmath61.0 , and @xmath12 @xmath62.0 for the four different low - ionization phases .",

    "metallicity constraints are again often limited because of the difficulty in separating the contributions of the two phases . however , of the 11 cases of single - cloud weak absorbers for which some metallicity constraint could be obtained , 2 cases require the metallicity of the low - ionization phase to be be solar or even super - solar @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a total of 7/11 of the low redshift cases required a metallicity of at least one tenth of the solar value .",
    "we note that the metallicities are often quite likely to be higher than these strict lower limits because they are derived assuming that none of the ly@xmath9  absorption comes from the high - ionization clouds .",

    "values constrained to be greater than 1/10th the solar value are even more common .",
    "furthermore , it is likely that in many cases for which lower limits on metallicity have been derived the actual value is much higher .",
    "the metallicity constraint that we have derived for the  = 1.7557 absorber in this paper is high because this system is a rare case that does not have offset absorption that contributes to the ly@xmath9  absorption . in other ways",
    "there is no reason to think it is unusual .",

    "we therefore know that single - cloud weak absorbers at both low and high redshift definitely have metallicities of at least 1/10th solar , but that some and probably many have solar or even supersolar metallicities .    thus even before @xmath58 star formation must have polluted certain environments with metal - rich gas . since @xcite could not constrain any @xmath0 @xmath12 1.5 single - cloud weak absorbers to have close to solar metallicity , and",
    "since several lower redshift solar metallicity cases were known , they tentatively suggested that there might be a gradual build - up of metals in the single - cloud weak absorber population . in this paper , we have shown there is at least one strong counter - example , i.e. of @xmath0 @xmath12 1.5 solar metallicity cases , and therefore there appears to be no metallicity evolution in the population .",
    "this is not to say that the population has a narrow range of physical properties : there is a large spread of cloud densities and metallicities at all redshifts ( see figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "however , it does suggest that common processes are at work to create the metals , and that the metals are mixed into fairly similar surrounding environments .    the existence of high metallicity ( greater than solar ) compact intergalactic clouds ( @xmath59  pc ) has also been demonstrated by @xcite , who derived robust lower limits on metallicities of absorbers using similar photoionization modeling techniques .",
    "@xcite find that the number density of this population of high metallicity absorbers is of the same order as that of single - cloud weak absorbers , and suggests that the former might evolve from the latter as material expands .",
    "more observations allowing direct connections between these populations will be of great interest .",

    "this discrepancy ( i.e. , `` missing - metals problem '' ) remains an unresolved problem .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( ii ) the dla region is sampling a lower metallicity than is found in the star - forming parts of the galaxy @xcite .",

    "dlas that are produced in the host galaxies of gamma - ray bursts tend to have higher metallicities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could be more representative of typical star - forming regions .",

    "it is striking that weak absorbers , despite having drastically smaller  values , have considerably higher metallicities than the dlas , both at low redshift and at @xmath0 @xmath1 1.7 .",
    "because they are not near regions with current star formation , the dust - to - gas ratio in single - cloud weak absorbers is expected to be very small . even for dlas",
    ", it has been demonstrated that there is no bias against observing high metallicities due to dust obscuration of their background quasars @xcite . even if the dust - to - gas ratio is similar to those in dlas",
    ", their total dust column density should be much smaller than those in dlas , because of their lower gas column densities .",
    "thus , they would not be subject to the metallicity bias that was more likely to have affected dlas .",
    "thus the weak absorbers provide an opportunity to see some high metallicity regions of the universe at high redshift , though they are not the same type of regions that would produce high metallicity dla absorption .    relating to the idea that dlas sample low metallicity parts of galaxies , the weak absorbers , despite their low column densities , must somehow sample higher metallicity regions which are not closely related to luminous galaxies .",
    "this provides clear evidence for metallicity inhomogeneities , which because of the size constraints for single - cloud weak absorbers , are on very small scales ( parsecs to hundreds of parsecs ) .",
    "sub - dla absorbers , with @xmath46  @xmath5 19.0  20.3 , have been found to have systematically higher metallicities than dlas with the -weighted value larger by 0.5  0.8 dex , at 0.6 @xmath7 @xmath0 @xmath7 3.2 @xcite .",

    "there is considerable overlap between the metallicity constraints for sub - dlas and single - cloud weak absorbers at low and intermediate redshifts .",

    "another apparent difference between the metallicities of single - cloud weak absorbers and sub - dlas , is that there is no clear increase in the metallicity of the single - cloud weak absorbers over the range 0.4 @xmath7 @xmath0 @xmath7 1.7 .",
    "this type of absorption is apparently produced by the same types of regions present over this redshift range , though they are known to be less common at low redshifts and at @xmath0 @xmath12 2 @xcite .",
    "the sample size of weak systems is now much smaller than those for dlas and sub - dlas , and only a few cases have been confirmed to have super - solar metallicities .",
    "it is quite important to increase the sample size of weak absorbers , particularly to include other systems with only one component such that a strong constraint on metallicity can be derived . at @xmath63",
    "this will involve high resolution observations with _ hst_/cos or _ hst_/stis of quasars for which high - resolution optical spectra are also available .",
    "intermediate in @xmath46  between single - cloud weak absorption and sub - dla s are lyman limit and partial lyman limit systems , with @xmath46  @xmath5 16  19 .",
    "these populations loosely correspond to the bulk of the strong absorber population , with @xmath2(2796 ) @xmath12 0.3   , and to multiple - cloud weak absorbers .",
    "fewer of these systems have been studied in detail to date , but it is still possible to derive good constraints on metallicities in many cases , using photoionization modeling techniques the same as those employed here .",
    "the ten cases of strong and multiple - cloud weak absorbers at 0.7 @xmath7 @xmath0 @xmath7 1.9 @xcite , shown on figure  [ fig7 ] , have metallicities ranging from @xmath61.5 @xmath7 @xmath39 @xmath7 0.6 . these are consistent with the ranges for both sub - dlas and single - cloud weak absorbers , but tend to be higher than those for dlas . without larger samples , we can not distinguish differences or evolutionary trends , but again we note that many of these are measurements of the metallicity , while for the single - cloud weak absorbers the low metallicity values are all lower limits .      in summary ,",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows that it is the lowest systems , that appear to have the highest metallicities , both at @xmath0 @xmath7 1 and at @xmath0 @xmath1 1.7 .",
    "the data are even consistent with a gradual increase in metallicity with decreasing , though there is a huge spread at any given value .",
    "such a trend has already been pointed out using compiled samples of dlas and sub - dlas @xcite , extending down to sub - dlas with @xmath46  @xmath1 19 @xcite .",
    "@xcite also suggested that a similar trend continued to strong systems with smaller hydrogen column densities .",
    "the individual systems plotted on figure  [ fig7 ] , however , are only the systems with detected absorption .",
    "in particular , for single - cloud weak absorbers we are sure to be missing objects with metallicities significantly less than those of the systems that we do detect .",
    "in fact , those lower metallicity objects are part of the much larger ly@xmath9  forest population .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] also shows the typical metallicities of ly@xmath9  forest clouds , both those with @xmath46",
    "@xmath12 14.5 , which have @xmath39 @xmath62.0 @xcite , and those with lower column densities , which have a mean metallicity of @xmath64  @xmath63.2 @xcite .",
    "these much lower values for the ly@xmath9  forest overlap with the dla metallicities at @xmath0 @xmath122.5 , but are smaller than those for low redshift dlas .    the fact that the high metallicity population of single - cloud weak absorbers represents only a small fraction of all ly@xmath9forest clouds does not diminish their significance . the single - cloud weak absorbers at @xmath0 @xmath1 1 would account for 25 ",
    "100%  of the ly@xmath9  forest clouds with 15.8 @xmath7 @xmath46  @xmath7 16.8 @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the cross - section of single - cloud weak absorbers in the plane of the sky is comparable to that of galaxies at @xmath0 @xmath1 1 , considering the regions of galaxies @xmath5130  40  kpc that produce lyman limit absorption .",
    "thus there are significant regions of the universe covered by these mysterious near - solar or super - solar metallicity objects with small @xmath46 .",
    "as described above , one explanation proposed for the larger metallicities for sub - dlas than for dlas is the dust obscuration of quasars that have the highest metallicity dlas in their foregrounds .",
    "although there may be some debate about whether this is a plausible explanation of that trend , it is not likely to explain the continued increase in metallicity toward the lowest @xmath46  weak absorbers .",
    "there is not likely to be a large selection effect due to dust obscuration for even the sub - dla systems .",
    "it seems more plausible that different types of absorbers are sampling different types of regions in and around galaxies , which can have large variations in metallicities even on small scales .",
    "different types of galaxies , e.g. star - forming versus quiescent , will have different fractions of area covered by regions of the different types . by comparing to the mass - metallicity relation seen in star - forming galaxies at local universe @xcite and higher",
    "redshift @xcite , @xcite and @xcite proposed that the dlas are associated with low - mass ( @xmath7 @xmath65 @xmath66 ) galaxies , while sub - dlas and weaker llss are probably the systems that arise in massive spiral / elliptical galaxies .",
    "the question remains : how do the single - cloud weak absorbers develop such high metallicities even at redshifts as high as @xmath0 @xmath1 1.7 ?",
    "we know that the lines of sight that pass through these objects have  five or six orders of magnitude below the star formation threshold .",
    "we also know that most single - cloud weak absorbers are not located very close to luminous galaxies , but that they tend to be in the vicinity @xcite .",
    "outflowing gas from dwarf galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or from lyman break galaxies at higher redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could partially contribute to the high metallicities in single - cloud weak systems .",
    "@xcite have argued that high metallicity intergalactic clouds may be ejected as small clumps in superwinds from star - forming galaxies .",
    "however , at least some of the very high metallicity single - cloud weak absorbers show signs of line detections ( e.g. our system  1 and several systems in @xcite ) , although sometimes it is detected with only a few @xmath21 level . for those systems , it has been stated that they are not @xmath9-enhanced , and that `` in situ '' star formation , including the less energetic type  ia sne that increase the iron to magnesium ratio , is responsible for enriching the gas @xcite . here",
    ", readers should be aware that it is not the gas along the weak absorber line of sight that has formed stars , since it has much too low a column density .",
    "it must instead be a nearby molecular cloud region that was actively star forming more than 1 billion years before the time from which we observe the absorber .",
    "that region would itself produce dla absorption if a line of sight passed through it .",
    "it is known that many dlas at @xmath0 @xmath7 1 are associated only with dwarf or low surface brightness galaxies @xcite , and that in at least one case no galaxy is detected in deep narrow - band h@xmath9 images @xcite .",
    "so then why do dlas not have high metallicities as well ? and how do we explain the general trend of increasing metallicity with decreasing ? the reason could be simple .",
    "large quantities of metals can be produced in star forming regions in a variety of environments , inside and outside of galaxies .",
    "however , the metals will be dispersed into widely different types of regions , depending upon the environment . within giant galaxies",
    "molecular cloud regions are typically surrounded by a significant volume of high density , high column density gas .",
    "so the metallicity is diminished by a large dilution effect as the ejected metals are spread through the galaxy region . in an intergalactic star - forming region , which is metal - polluted by _",
    "in - situ _ star formation or has been ejected from a nearby dwarf galaxy , the clouds may not have a significant volume of high column density gas around it , thus the dilution could be minimal .",
    "this would especially apply in a shallow potential well , where much of the surrounding gas is ejected by the early type  ii sne , and the remnant low density gas remaining is greatly enhanced by the metals produced by later type  ia s which encounter a relatively sparse surrounding medium .",
    "the same type of dilution effect could lead to dlas having lower metallicity than sub - dlas .",
    "@xcite suggests that the super - solar metallicity sub - dlas that they observed at @xmath0 @xmath1 1.7 , extreme members of the sub - dla population , are related to regions affected by the feedback from actively star - forming regions .",
    "the metals would be spread to larger lower density sub - dla regions by energetic processes .",
    "obviously , the metallicity of a region is determined by a combination of the amount of star formation activity in its vicinity and the overall density of its gas . in the case of the single - cloud weak absorbers ,",
    "we conclude that the density effect dominates , leading to unexpected patches of high metallicity outside of galaxies . in the contrasting case of a dla",
    ", there is just too much gas around it to dilute the metals coming through it , and a low metallicity often results .",

    "<S> ( 1 ) : :    the single - cloud weak absorption in the three @xmath0    @xmath1 1.7 systems is produced by clouds with ionization    parameters of @xmath63.8 @xmath7 @xmath8    @xmath62.0 and sizes of 1  100  pc . </S>",

    "<S> ( 3 ) : :    two of the three single - cloud weak absorbers have near - solar or    super - solar metallicities , if we assume a solar abundance pattern .    </S>",
    "<S> although such large metallicities have been found for @xmath0    @xmath7 1 weak absorbers , these are the first high    metallicities derived for such systems at higher redshifts . </S>",
