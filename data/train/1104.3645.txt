    "the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite is a proposed collider that will collide electrons and positrons at high energy and luminosity and is expected to verify the predictions of the standard model ( sm ) at a high level of precision , and to establish interactions beyond the sm even if there is no direct production of particles that are not in the spectrum of the sm .",
    "one window to such new physics is the discovery of cp violation beyond what is predicted by the sm ; for a review on basic principles of cp violation at colliders , see ref .",
    "it has been shown that the availability of beam polarization of one or both of the beams , transverse and longitudinal , can significantly enhance the sensitivity to such beyond the sm interactions ; see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "if beyond the sm interactions are very subtle , then it is particularly important to search for deviations from the sm to linear order . keeping these considerations in mind ,",
    "the issue of sensitivity to linear order of cp - violating anomalous gauge boson couplings , denoted by @xmath2 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath3 ) to be defined later , that contribute to the process @xmath10 with longitudinal beam polarization was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and with transverse beam polarization in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for earlier discussions in the context of unpolarized beams see ref .",
    "@xcite , and ref .",
    "@xcite for beam polarization effects ) .",
    "these couplings are absent in the sm even at loop level , and can be thought of representing some basic interactions arising from an underlying theory ; for instance they can arise in some extensions of the sm at the one - loop level @xcite , and thus their nonvanishing value indicates a signature of new physics .",
    "anomalous couplings have been investigated at the large electron positron ( lep ) collider , resulting in limits of the order of 0.05 ( 0.13 ) on the magnitude of @xmath3 ( @xmath11 ) couplings @xcite .",
    "the most stringent bounds on the absolute value of these couplings comes from the recent d0 and cdf collaboration results of tevatron  @xcite .",
    "apart from these direct limits , imposing unitarity of partial wave scattering amplitudes can give limits on the couplings @xcite .",
    "for an ilc operating at @xmath12 gev , the analysis of czyz et al .",
    "@xcite gives the unitarity limits @xmath13 .",
    "other unitarity limits are expressed as of the order of ( 0.1 tev@xmath14 on dimension-6 couplings and of the order of ( @xmath15 tev@xmath16 on dimension-8 couplings , where @xmath17 is the assumed scale of new physics @xcite .",
    "a review of these results may be found in ref .",
    "considerations of the anomalous sector involving w bosons have also been recently studied in the context of the large hadron collider , see refs .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite for quartic couplings involving @xmath8 pairs along with w pairs as well as z pairs and references therein .",
    "since , in the process at hand , @xmath18- and @xmath19-channel exchanges are present there is an additional dependence on the polar scattering angle ( @xmath20 ) between @xmath8 and @xmath21 direction .",
    "a polar - angle forward - backward asymmetry is seen with longitudinally - polarized beams due to the interference of the cp - violating anomalous coupling with sm contribution  @xcite , because the photon should be produced symmetrically if cp is conserved .",
    "longitudinal beam polarization improves sensitivity to some of the form factors , whereas the transversely polarized beams with new combinations of polar and azimuthal asymmetries enable better measurement .",
    "this is due to the fact that with transverse beam polarization , one has an additional angle @xmath22 , the azimuthal angle with respect to the direction of quantization of the electron polarization , which allows one to obtain distributions that are sensitive to the real parts of the anomalous couplings . in order to obtain the fully differential cross sections in the presence of anomalous gauge couplings ,",
    "one may use the helicity amplitudes listed in ref .",
    "@xcite and account for the transverse polarization using the generalized formalism of ref .",
    "suitable asymmetries may then be constructed which can be used to extract these anomalous couplings .",
    "furthermore , one can obtain 90% confidence limits on these couplings if no signal is observed for realistic beam polarization and typical integrated luminosities .",
    "it may be emphasized that the limits obtained in this work are completely based on an analytical approach and is a strength of the method and is an extension of the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite which have proven necessary for the extraction of re  @xmath2 .",
    "it would be a useful benchmark for future simulation studies of the same system .    as a consequence of the cpt theorem , in the absence of beam polarization and with longitudinal beam polarization ,",
    "only the imaginary parts of these contribute to the cross section at linear order .",
    "it turns out that with transverse beam polarization and due to the interference of the sm amplitudes with those arising from anomalous couplings , only re@xmath4 contributes to the fully differential cross section , whereas the re@xmath2 contribution vanishes because the photon has only vectorlike couplings .",
    "thus the question of isolating @xmath23 to leading order remains open .",
    "recently , it was shown , in the context of @xmath24 production with beyond the sm interactions parametrized in terms of effective four - fermi interactions , that the measurement of final - state helicity can help in disentangling the contributions of scalar and tensor like four - fermi interactions when the beams are transversely polarized  @xcite .    inspired by the considerations in the work above , we now ask whether at leading order one can isolate @xmath23 by the measurement of the helicity of the @xmath6 or the photon .",
    "the answer is in the affirmative . whereas the considerations of the top - quark helicity referred to above",
    "can be extended to the @xmath6 , which we describe in a little detail later on , there is no analogous method for determining the helicity of the photon as it is a stable particle . at low energies",
    "the final - state helicity determination is a key ingredient for the determination of neutrino helicity in the well - known goldhaber experiment  @xcite .",
    "however , it is conceivable that there are materials that can be used in the construction of the ilc detectors which could be used for these determinations . in particular aligned crystals could be candidates for such detectors in case of high - energy photons , as has been considered by the na59 collaboration@xcite .",
    "leaving aside the experimental question of measurement of the final - state helicities , which would affect the sensitivity , we construct asymmetries that involve , e.g. , samples of positive and negative @xmath6 helicities , and also photon helicities .",
    "these are then translated into 90% confidence limits on the anomalous couplings @xmath25 by combining them with the previously established results .",
    "the best limits are expressed in the @xmath23-@xmath26 plane .",
    "if these are set to zero one at a time , then we obtain the limit on @xmath23 to be 0.0958 when the helicity of only the @xmath6 is resolved for a total center - of - mass energy ( c.m . ) of 500 gev with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath27 and realistic polarizations .",
    "an improved limit of @xmath28 is obtained when the helicity of @xmath8 is resolved .",
    "the stability of these limits when they are fed back into the expressions at quadratic order for the cross section is also addressed , by iteratively including the effects which turn out to be not of great significance in practice .",

    "in this section we discuss how the final - state helicities of the @xmath6 and the @xmath8 can be utilized in practice .",
    "we begin by discussing the case of the helicity of the @xmath6 .",
    "the discussion closely parallels the discussion that was recently provided for measuring the helicity of the top - quark in @xmath24 production given in ref .",
    "so far we have assumed that it would be possible to isolate a sample of events where the @xmath6 has a definite helicity , which in practice is not possible as one can only measure polarization at a statistical level .",
    "unlike an incoming beam of particles , which can be prepared in a pure spin state , an outgoing particle is not available in a pure state , but only a mixed state , yielding only an average polarization . in order to be able to make use of the definitions of various asymmetries which we discuss , we propose a practical method which would serve to provide a sample with predominantly positive or negative z helicities , which would lead to a depletion of the efficiency , but would be able to achieve the main objective .",
    "the spin of an unstable particle like the @xmath6 can be analyzed by looking at the distribution of its decay products .",
    "the decay distribution of a lepton produced from a @xmath6 with a definite helicity in the rest frame of the @xmath6 is given by [ polt ] = , [ pol0 ] = ^2 _ , where @xmath153 is the angle made by the momentum of the @xmath154 with the spin quantization axis of the @xmath6 .",
    "the quantity which differentiates between the positive and negative helicity @xmath6 distributions is 0.147 . for an elementary derivation of this result ,",
    "10.2 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is thus seen from eqs .",
    "( [ polt ] ) , ( [ pol0 ] ) that the @xmath154 tends to be emitted dominantly in the backward direction relative to the spin of the @xmath6 for transverse polarization , and peaks at @xmath155 for longitudinal polarization .",
    "thus , by applying a cut keeping dominant emission of the fermions in the direction of the boost of the @xmath6 , one can obtain a sample which is enriched in events with negative helicity .",
    "similarly , a cut keeping dominantly backward emission will yield a sample enriched in events with positive helicity .",
    "finally , keeping leptons emitted mostly in the transverse direction will give a sample with dominantly zero helicity .",
    "thus , one has to actually generate events including @xmath6 decay and use the formulas to make predictions , and then compare the expected number of events for a given set of anomalous couplings with experiment and then place a limit .",
    "such a procedure would give limits which are less stringent than obtained in our analysis .",
    "strictly speaking , we should include full spin density matrices for @xmath6 production as well as decay into a certain final state , and consider asymmetries constructed out of the momenta of the decay products .",
    "however , we expect that the procedure described here will approximate such a complete description , with some reduction of efficiency .",
    "to get some quantitative idea of the efficiency , we note that if we use the three charged - lepton channels for @xmath6 decay , with a combined branching ratio of about 10% , with the simplifying assumption that the @xmath156-pair detection efficiency is 1 , the sensitivity is a factor of @xmath157 of less .",
    "the inclusion of a @xmath158 channel would improve the sensitivity somewhat . a full analysis including @xmath6 decay entails a more complicated analysis with a different final state , and is beyond the scope of this work .    for projecting the final - state @xmath8 helicity",
    ", there is no analogous method , as it is stable . in the context of the goldhaber neutrino helicity experiment @xcite , photons of a particular helicity were filtered out by the means of a magnetic material .",
    "depending on the helicity state , photons are either absorbed in the material or not .",
    "thus , by counting the events in the photopeaks observed with the scintillation detector for two different polarizations of the magnet , they determined the photon helicity . here",
    "also one can conceive of using such a material in the construction of the ilc detector which could be used for polarization determination .",
    "we note here that , in the context of photon polarimetry measurements , it has been demonstrated by the cern na59 collaboration@xcite that an aligned - crystal technology can be used for an accurate measurement of the polarization of initial - state photons in polarized photon collisions at high energies typical of the photon - photon collision mode of the ilc .",
    "thus , it is conceivable that such technology could be extended to the needs of a detector that would seek to resolve the final - state photon helicity .",
    "we therefore advocate the construction of such photon helicity filtering detectors at the ilc that can open up the possibility of further improving the bound on re@xmath2 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the process @xmath0 at the ilc at @xmath125= 500 gev and 800 gev with a realistic integrated luminosity .",
    "we have pointed out the benefits of the resolution of final - state spin for studying the effects of couplings which were otherwise invisible with initial longitudinal as well as transverse states .",
    "inspired by the work of final - state top - spin measurement we have shown that one can isolate @xmath159 in the above process with initial transverse states by the measurement of the helicity of the @xmath6 or the photon .",
    "we have also made a numerical study of the limits on various couplings that could be obtained at a future linear collider assuming realistic transverse polarizations of 80% and 60% respectively for @xmath21 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "we have also given the contour plot for allowed region in @xmath23-@xmath90 plane .",
    "we see that with final - state spin resolution , transverse polarization can provide a sensitive test of the anomalous coupling , re@xmath2 .",
    "overall it is seen that the resolution of helicity of @xmath8 gives better limits on the couplings compared to the case when the helicity of @xmath6 is resolved .",
    "the above is due to the fact that only transversely polarized @xmath6 is sensitive to re@xmath2 , but its contribution is smaller by a factor of @xmath122 .",
    "moreover the contribution of re@xmath2 and re@xmath4 to the asymmetries @xmath135 and @xmath136 is inversely proportional to @xmath125 .",
    "therefore in the case @xmath125 = 800 gev the resolving power of asymmetries using the helicity of the @xmath6 is suppressed compared to the case when the helicity of @xmath8 is resolved . since the anomalous couplings @xmath23 and @xmath90 can not be completely disentangled through helicity measurements we present both simultaneous and individual limits where the latter is obtained by setting one of the couplings to zero at a time .",
    "these limits are found to be stable , when fed back into the expressions to quadratic order for the cross section .",
    "the asymmetries and the limits on the couplings are also calculated with the inclusion of quadratic terms for the cross section .",
    "the new limits obtained are summarized in tables  [ g_table1 ] and [ g_table2 ] .",
    "it must , however , be mentioned that one can not directly isolate events with @xmath6 helicities of @xmath160 or @xmath161 . hence to measure the asymmetries we discuss",
    ", one would have to carry out a subtraction of events in two kinematic regions of the decay products corresponding to positive and negative polarizations of the @xmath6 .",
    "doing so would entail a loss of efficiency to a certain extent .",
    "we have not taken this into account .",
    "it may be possible to consider the cases when the helicities of @xmath6 as well as @xmath8 can be resolved .",
    "indeed , the technology with aligned crystals , see ref .",
    "@xcite could be adapted for the final - state photon helicity resolution .",
    "it may be possible to carry out a study based on this , but is beyond the scope of the present work , as the features that we wish to study are already apparent when we sum over the helicity of one of the other .",
    "furthermore , measuring both spins would lead to a loss in statistics thereby making this option less attractive .",
    "additional studies beyond the scope of the present work are related to polarimetry .",
    "we conclude by discussing some further approaches of value to the process at hand .",
    "it has been proposed that the hard radiative decay of the @xmath6 can also be used to place bounds on the magnitude of anomalous cp - violating couplings  @xcite .",
    "of special significance is the construction presented in refs .",
    "@xcite of the formalism of a general spin-1 density matrix for the @xmath6-boson spin orientation introduced in the context of cp  conserving anomalous couplings .",
    "it would be of interest to see if this can be extended to the case of cp  violating anomalous couplings and so explore the possibility of using this formalism to obtain bounds on such couplings as we have done here . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the process has been studied with bsm interactions given by most general contact interactions with the helicities of the @xmath8 and @xmath6 summed over .",
    "it may be of interest to apply the present considerations to this scenario as well .",
