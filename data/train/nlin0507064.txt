    "the development of the technologies of producing the low - dimensional quantum structures ( wells , wires ) , growing the semiconductor crystals strengthens an interest to theoretical investigation of the nonlinear coherent phenomena in the anisotropic media@xmath0 .",
    "the quantum states of the particles being contained in such the media possess no certain parity , owing to what the diagonal elements of the matrix of the dipole moment operator and their differences , which are called the permanent dipole moments of the transitions , are distinct from zero .    the propagation in optically uniaxial media of the two - component laser pulses consisting of ordinary and extraordinary components was studied in@xmath1 .",
    "it was suggested@xmath2 that the linear velocities of both the components are equal , and the concentration of the resonant particles is small sufficiently for the approximation of the unidirectional propagation to be valid .",
    "various modes of the optical transparency were classified with regard to the pulse propagation velocity and the degree of the resonant particles excitation .",
    "the mode of self - induced transparency ( sit ) is characterized by strong excitation of the medium and substantial deceleration in the velocity of the pulse propagation relative to linear one .",
    "the self - induced supertransparency ( sist ) mode differs from sit in that the decrease of velocity of the pulses is small , but the medium is strongly excited as well . in this mode ,",
    "the carrier frequency of ordinary component of the pulses , which cause full inversion of the quantum level population , is lower than the resonance frequency .",
    "the width of such the pulses is determined by the amount of the ordinary component detuning .",
    "( the full inversion of initial state of the resonant particles in the isotropic case happens under condition of the exact resonance only . )",
    "the sist pulses have larger amplitudes and smaller duration as compared to the sit ones , and local frequency of their ordinary component is strongly modulated .",
    "there exist also the modes in that the trapping of the quantum level population takes place .",
    "the pulses propagating in the extraordinary transparency ( eot ) mode are characterized by small detuning of the ordinary component from the resonance and by dominant role of the extraordinary component .",
    "their group velocity substantially changes and may become comparable to one of the pulses causing strong excitation .",
    "in the modes of positive nonresonant transparency ( pnt ) and negative nonresonant transparency ( nnt ) , the pulse velocity changes insignificantly , and the absolute value of detuning is large .",
    "the extraordinary component of the pulse dominates in the former mode , whereas the ordinary - to - extraordinary amplitude ratio is arbitrary in the latter . the most substantial difference between these modes concerns the behavior of effective detuning . in the nnt mode",
    ", it remains virtually constant .",
    "if a pulse propagates in the pnt mode , then the effective detuning of the frequency of the ordinary component changes sign due to an influence of the extraordinary one .",
    "since the local frequency passes through the resonance , a slightly stronger excitation of the medium occurs here , and the pulses are sharply peaked , as in the sist mode .    in present report",
    ", we consider the propagation of the two - component electromagnetic pulses through the optically uniaxial medium containing two - level particles .",
    "unlike the case studied in@xmath2 , the approximation of unidirectional propagation is not applied .",
    "also , linear velocities of ordinary and extraordinary components are not assumed to be equal . in section 2 ,",
    "we write down the system of material and wave equations for resonant propagation of the electromagnetic pulses in a direction perpendicular to the optical axis of the anisotropic medium . exponentially and rationally decreasing solutions of this system",
    "are given here as well .",
    "using these solutions , we establish in sections 3 and 4 the distinctive features of the manifestation of the transparency modes under discussion in ",
    "dense  media and in the media with expressed positive and negative birefringences .",
    "the pulse solutions studied in the previous sections are modified in section 5 on the case of isotropic , optically dense media , in which the direct electric dipole - dipole interaction of the resonant particles should be taken into account .",
    "consider a birefringent medium containing the resonant , two - level particles .",
    "suppose that the plane , two - component pulse consisting of high - frequency ordinary component @xmath3 and video - pulse extraordinary one @xmath4 , propagates through the medium in a direction perpendicular to its optical axes . the system of material and wave equations describing the dynamics of the quantum systems and the evolution of the components of the electric field in the slowly varying envelope approximation has the next form@xmath5 : @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 here the inversion population @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and coherency @xmath12 are expressed through the elements of the density matrix of the resonant particles ; @xmath13 is detuning of the carrier frequency @xmath14 of the ordinary component from resonant frequency @xmath15 of the quantum transition ( @xmath16 ) ; @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is an envelope of the pulse ordinary component ( @xmath19 ) ; @xmath20 ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the dipole moment and the permanent dipole moment of the transition , respectively ; @xmath23 is the plank s constant ; @xmath24 ; @xmath25 ; @xmath26 is the concentration of the particles ; @xmath27 is the velocity of the light in vacuum ; @xmath28 and",
    "@xmath29 are ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the physical distance and time .    the nonlinear equations arising from system ( [ 1][4 ] ) under condition @xmath32 in the approximation of unidirectional propagation and their pulse solutions were investigated in work@xmath2 .",
    "the classification of the modes of nonlinear propagation of the two - component electromagnetic pulses , which are distinguished by the behavior of the quantum particles and by the characteristics of the pulses , was given .",
    "it turns out that the pulse solutions of the system of material and wave equations studied there can be modified properly for the case considered .",
    "indeed , the following expressions are obtained @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 is positive parameter ; @xmath43 is an initial population of the quantum levels .",
    "we will assume in the subsequent sections that the initial state of the quantum particles is stable : @xmath44 .",
    "it is seen that the ordinary component phase modulation @xmath45 is equal to @xmath46 . defining the pulse duration @xmath47 as the double deviation from the zero point of @xmath48 ,",
    "at which @xmath49 is half its maximum value , we obtain from formula ( [ 5 ] ) : @xmath50    since parameter @xmath51 depends not only on the characteristics of the medium , as it was@xmath2 , but also from parameters @xmath52 and @xmath42 of the pulse , the anisotropy caused by the permanent dipole moment becomes effective .",
    "thereof , the domains of the pulse parameters values , in which exist the optical transparency modes described in@xmath2 , will change .",
    "it is remarkable that the condition of strong excitation of the medium is written in the same manner : @xmath53 the pulses , whose parameters satisfy this condition , will cause the full inversion of initial state of the quantum particles .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 , which does not vanish only for a medium having a permanent dipole moment , will be called the effective anisotropy in the sequel .    taking the limit @xmath55 in formulas ( [ 5][9 ] )",
    ", we obtain rationally decreasing solution of system ( [ 1][4 ] ) : @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 this solution , as the algebraic solution of the derivative nonlinear schrdinger equation@xmath61 ( dnse ) , has one parameter ( without taking account of the shifts on variables @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "this is not surprising , because the system of the equations considered in@xmath2 and dnse belong to the same hierarchy of the nonlinear equations integrable in the frameworks of the inverse scattering transformation method@xmath62 .",
    "also , rationally decreasing solution having no arbitrary parameters was found for the case of the one - component pulses propagating through the anisotropic media@xmath63 .",
    "parameter @xmath64 in formulas ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 11a ] ) is supposed to be real .",
    "this imposes a constraint on detuning @xmath52 of the rationally decreasing pulses .",
    "it is seen from equation ( [ 11a ] ) that the full inversion of the medium takes place if detuning of the pulse satisfy condition @xmath65 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the case of  dense  media , when the concentration of the resonant particles is large enough so that condition @xmath66 is not satisfied .",
    "we use quotes to stress its difference from the case of optically dense media , in which the effects of the local field are considered .",
    "since the refractive indices of typical anisotropic medium are such that inequality @xmath67 holds , we can assume that the first multiplicand in the denominator in the right - hand side of ( [ 9 ] ) is close to unity .",
    "then , formula ( [ 9 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath68    it can be shown that the transparency modes described in@xmath2 exist for the  dense  media as well .",
    "if @xmath69 , then @xmath51 can exceed @xmath70 in the general case .",
    "one can see that this takes place if @xmath71 however , expression ( [ 9 ] ) can not be replaced by ( [ d_dm ] ) under this condition .",
    "therefore , the effective anisotropy can not exceed @xmath70 in the  dense  medium case , and the modes of strong excitation ( with @xmath72 ) must be more expressed .    using ( [ 10 ] ) and",
    "( [ d_dm ] ) , we find that parameters @xmath42 and @xmath52 of the pulse causing the full inversion of the medium are related as given : @xmath73 where @xmath74 it is obvious that @xmath75    it follows from ( [ tau_d ] ) that detuning of the pulses , whose propagation is accompanied by the largest change of the level population , can only be such that at least one of the quantities @xmath76 and @xmath77 is positive .",
    "it is easy to see that this is possible only if @xmath78 .",
    "since the coefficients at @xmath79 and @xmath52 in the right - hand side of ( [ * ] ) are positive and the coefficient at @xmath80 is zero , the product @xmath81 changes sign only once at @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , @xmath77 is negative in this domain , and @xmath76 is positive if @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the positive root of equation @xmath84 .",
    "thus , for a given detuning satisfying condition @xmath82 , only the pulses with a certain unique duration can strongly excite the medium .",
    "a similar result was obtained in the case , when the unidirectional propagation approximation was used , and the refractive indices were assumed to be equal@xmath2 .",
    "the carrier frequency of the ordinary component of a pulse that strongly excites the medium was also lower than the resonance frequency .",
    "note that parameter @xmath42 can not be smaller than a certain minimum for such the pulses .",
    "furthermore , in accordance with the classification@xmath2 , both modes of strong excitation can be identified in this case : the sit ( @xmath85 ) and sist ( @xmath86 ) modes correspond to @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively ( see fig .  1 ) .",

    "the corresponding value of the maximum detuning is @xmath92 .",
    "one can show that the interval of admissible detuning is wider for the  dense  medium ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "the effective anisotropy is more expressed in a low - density resonant medium , and a pulse can be resonant with the medium on average of its duration and thus cause strong excitation of the medium within a narrower interval of detuning .",
    "note also that the medium effectively becomes more isotropic with increasing @xmath94 , and also the slope of the curve described by ( [ tau_d ] ) increases with decreasing @xmath52 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the largest change of the quantum - level population in an isotropic medium can occur under the exact resonance condition only .",
    "it follows from the consideration carried out above that the decrease in the effective anisotropy in the  dense  medium does reinforce characteristic properties of pulses in the sit and sist modes .",
    "conversely , the nnt , pnt , and eot modes ( with @xmath95 ) become less expressed .",
