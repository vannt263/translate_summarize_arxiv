    "chiral lagrangians , as the effective low - energy realization of qcd , have become increasingly important in hadronic physics . in the sector of up and down quarks and for vanishing quark masses",
    ", qcd exhibits an exact global @xmath4 chiral symmetry . in the non - perturbative vacuum , this symmetry is spontaneously broken to its vectorial subgroup @xmath5 with the appearence of pions as goldstone bosons .",
    "the interaction of the goldstone bosons is greatly restricted by chiral symmetry involving the ratios @xmath6 and @xmath7 as a small expansion parameters , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the pion mass , the pion energy and the weak pion decay constant respectively .",
    "a systematic expansion is provided by chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath11 scattering amplitude is determined order by order in the number of derivatives . in this way",
    "the low - energy theorems are known to be maintained . for many reasons , however , it would be interesting to have a non - perturbative approach while still maintaining the low - energy theorems .",
    "one obvious reason is the requirement of unitarity of the s - matrix in the scattering problem .",
    "another relates to the thermodynamics of effective chiral theories , especially in the study of chiral restauration . as the critical point",
    "is approached one can not expect perturbation theory to provide a valid description .",
    "needless to say that the question of preserving the symmetries non - perturbatively is a very delicate one @xcite . while in perturbative calculations the class of diagrams that ought to be considered in order to preserve the symmetries in the physical observables is well known , the situation is far less clear in the non - perturbative case .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to demonstrate that such a program is indeed possible .",
    "our theoretical framework will be the linear @xmath0-model which is especially suited for the techniques to be employed .",
    "these techniques have their origin in many - body physics and consist of a mean - field treatment via a bogoliubov rotation supplemented by rpa fluctuations .",
    "it is well known that such an approach , while being non - perturbative , treats symmetries and spontaneous symmetry breaking correctly @xcite .",
    "we shall demonstrate that , exactly as in the fermionic case , the rpa built on the selfconsistent mean field is able to restore the symmetry broken by the mean - field vacuum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first the formulation of the bosonic mean - field problem will be given in sect .",
    "2 . in the quasi - particle basis",
    "thus obtained , the rpa excitation spectrum for the single - pion mode is constructed in sect .",
    "it will be shown explicitly that this spectrum contains a zero mode in the chiral limit , to be identified with the goldstone pion. in sect .",
    "4 the formalism will be extended to finite temperature as a first step towards a non - pertubative description of the chiral phase transition .",
    "again , there is no mass generation in the chiral limit .",
    "conclusions and an outlook are given in sect .",

    "phase the vacuum condensate @xmath125 is finite and the bare mass @xmath148 negative such that the third equation in ( [ eq52 ] ) is satisfied in the chiral limit ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "there exists therefore a goldstone mode in the theory and the symmetry is no longer manifest in the particle spectrum which means that the masses of the @xmath0 and the @xmath15 are different . in the zero - temperature case",
    "we have demonstrated that hfb - rpa scheme is consistent with these requirements . + there is , however , an alternative solution of the third equation in ( [ eq52 ] ) .",
    "suppose the condensate @xmath125 vanishes at some temperature .",
    "in this case the three - particle coupling disappears from the interaction hamiltonian , as can be seen explicitly from eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "the single - particle state no longer couples to two - particle states and the only contribution of the single - particle masses is the one that comes from the four - point interactions in the mean - field calculation .",
    "this can also be checked explicitly from the rpa eigenvalues .",
    "it is now easy to see from eqs .",
    "( [ eq52 ] ) that the masses become degenerate _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath150 and we are in the wigner mode .",
    "the question is whether this is inconsistent with the fact that @xmath151 , the generator of the symmetry , commutes with the hamiltonian which leads to a spurious solution of the rpa in the goldstone phase .",
    "first one should note that if the masses are equal then the thermal occupation factors for both the pion and the sigma are the same .",
    "this leads to @xmath152 implying that the rpa spurious mode can not be normalized .",
    "secondly , from equation ( [ eq59 ] ) we see that to have the zero frequency mode , one must fulfill the following condition +   + @xmath153 + in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) one can prove the following identity + @xmath154 + which is only true , however , if all six terms in the excitation operator @xmath95 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq53 ] ) are kept .",
    "now the condition for a spurious mode solution can be simply recast as + @xmath155 + which means that the ratio of the symmetry breaking term in the lagrangian and the condensate must vanish to allow a zero - energy solution .",
    "this can only happen for finite @xmath125 _",
    "i.e. _ in the goldstone phase .",
    "once the wigner phase is reached this condition can no longer be satisfied .",
    "this reiterates the fact that the spurious mode is a manifestation of a broken symmetry which disappears once the latter is restored .",
    "in summary we have presented a non - perturbative method based on the well - known selfconsistent qrpa formalism for studying the linear @xmath0-model in the bosonic sector .",
    "being symmetry conserving the method yields a zero mode in the chiral limit .",
    "this is required by goldstone s theorem for a spontaneously broken symmetry . while , at field level , the pion acquires a mass through the bcs mechanism irrespective of the explicit symmetry breaking term in the lagrangian the inclusion of rpa correlations removes this artifact .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the extension of the qrpa to finite temperature is workable and reproduces the expected result that the zero mode persists at finite temperature .",
    "applications to the @xmath156-case as well as the inclusion of fermions are straightforward and are being considered .",
    "this will hopefully provide new insight into the nature of the chiral phase transition .",
    "since , in contrast to nambu - jona - lasinio type models , the linear @xmath0-model is renormalizable a program of non - perturbative renormalisation should be persued in order to assess its impact on the physics . despite the selfconsistency of the mean - field equations a solution of this problem",
    "does not seem out of reach .",
    "a challenging problem is the application of the formalism to the two - pion case . here one attempts to build a scattering equation which is consistent with the low - energy theorems required by the symmetry .",
    "as is known from the analogous fermionic problem higher rpa schemes have to be employed .",
    "in particular the second rpa @xcite is also symmerty conserving. its bosonic analog is easy to construct but some conceptual problems remain to be resolved .",
