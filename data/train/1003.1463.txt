    "the method of dispersive sum rules @xcite is one of the widely used methods for obtaining properties of the ground - state hadrons in qcd .",
    "the method involves two steps : ( i ) one calculates the relevant correlator in qcd at relatively small values of the euclidean time ; ( ii ) one applies numerical procedures prompted by quark - hadron duality in order to extract the ground - state contribution from this correlator .",
    "these numerical procedures can not determine a single value of the ground - state parameter but should provide the band of values containing the true hadron parameter with a flat probability distribution within this band @xcite .",
    "the width of this band is a systematic , or intrinsic , uncertainty of the method of sum rules .",
    "it is often claimed that the standard procedures of the method of sum rules allow one to obtain hadron parameters with about 10% accuracy for normal and exotic hadrons . in many cases",
    "this is true .",
    "however , there are some examples where the difference between the sum - rule predictions and the experimental results or between the results from different versions of sum rules turn out to be _ quite unexpectedly _ much larger than 10% : as the first example , recall an evident conflict between the prediction for the @xmath0 coupling from light - cone sum rules @xcite and the subsequent measurement of cleo @xcite ; as the second example , mention the incompatibility of the predictions for the pion form factor at intermediate momentum transfers from light - cone sum rules @xcite , local - duality sum rules @xcite , and sum rules with non - local condensates @xcite .",
    "a posteriori , these issues may be clarified .",
    "the real problem is , however , that the large errors  well exceeding a comfortable 10% level  could not be foreseen on the basis of the standard criteria adopted in the method of sum rules in qcd .",
    "an unbiased judgement of the reliability of the extraction procedures adopted in the method of sum rules may be acquired by applying these procedures to problems where the ground - state parameters may be found independently and exactly as soon as the parameters of the theory are fixed .",
    "presently , only quantum - mechanical potential models provide such a possibility .",
    "a simple harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) potential model @xcite possesses two essential features of qcd  confinement and asymptotic freedom @xcite  and has the following valuable features : ( i ) the bound - state parameters ( masses , wave functions , form factors ) are known precisely ; ( ii ) direct analogues of the qcd correlators may be calculated exactly .",
    "( for a discussion of many aspects of sum rules in quantum mechanics we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "making use of this model , we have already studied the extraction of ground - state parameters from different types of correlators : namely , the ground - state decay constant from two - point vacuum - to - vacuum correlator @xcite , the form factor from three - point vacuum - to - vacuum correlator @xcite , and the form factor from vacuum - to - hadron correlator @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that the standard procedures adopted in the method of sum rules do not work properly : for all types of correlators the true value of the bound - state parameter was shown to lie outside the band obtained according to the standard criteria .",
    "these results gave us a solid ground to claim that also in qcd the actual accuracy of the method turns out to be worse than expected on the basis of applying the standard criteria .",
    "we have realized that the main origin of this difficulty of the method lies in an over - simplified model for the hadron continuum , which is described as a perturbative contribution above a constant borel - parameter - independent effective continuum threshold .",
    "we have introduced the notion of the _ exact _ effective continuum threshold , which corresponds to the true bound - state parameters : in the ho model the true hadron parameters  decay constant and form factor  are known and the exact effective continuum thresholds for different correlators may be calculated .",
    "we have demonstrated that the exact effective continuum threshold ( i ) is not a universal quantity and depends on the correlator considered ( i.e. , it is in general different for two - point and three - point correlators ) , ( ii ) depends on the borel parameter and , for the form - factor case , also on the momentum transfer .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the `` borel stability criterion '' combined with the assumption of a borel - parameter - independent effective continuum threshold leads to the extraction of the wrong bound - state parameters .    in recent publications",
    "@xcite we formulated a new algorithm for extracting the parameters of the ground state .",
    "the idea proposed in these papers is to relax the standard assumption of a borel - parameter - independent effective continuum threshold and allow for a borel - parameter - dependent quantity .    in the present paper",
    "we develop this idea and provide details of its application to the extraction of hadron parameters from dispersive sum rules .",
    "we show that ( i ) the new algorithm leads to improvements  and for the case of the form factors to _ significant _ improvements  of the actual accuracy of the extracted bound - state parameters from all kinds of correlators in the potential model ; ( ii ) the _ procedures _ of extracting the ground - state parameters from the truncated operator product expansion ( ope ) for the two - point function in potential models and in qcd exhibit not only qualitative but also _ quantitative _ similarities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sect : qm ] presents the application of our new algorithm to the extraction of the ground - state parameters from correlators in a quantum - mechanical potential model .",
    "quantum - mechanical analogues of all correlators used in qcd for the extraction of ground - state parameters ( decay constants and form factors ) are discussed .",
    "section [ sect : qcd ] compares the extraction of the ground - state decay constant in qcd and in quantum - mechanical potential models .",
    "section [ sect : conclusions ] presents our concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a nonrelativistic hamiltonian @xmath1 with a ho interaction potential @xmath2 , @xmath3 : @xmath4 in this model , all characteristics of the bound states are easily calculable .",
    "for instance , for the ground state ( g ) , one finds @xmath5 where the elastic form factor of the ground state is defined in terms of the ground - state wave function @xmath6 as @xmath7 and the current operator @xmath8 is given by the kernel @xmath9      the quantum - mechanical analogue of the borelized polarization operator @xcite has the form @xmath10 for the ho potential , the analytic expression for @xmath11 is well - known @xcite : @xmath12^{3/2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] apart from the overall factor , @xmath11 is a function of one parameter @xmath13 .",
    "let us define the average energy of the polarization function as @xmath14 at @xmath15 both @xmath11 and @xmath16 diverge .    making use of the `` hadronic '' bound states of the model , we obtain the following representation for @xmath11 : @xmath17 for large values of @xmath18 the contributions of the excited states to the correlator vanish and therefore @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "the deviation of the energy from @xmath21 at finite values of @xmath18 measures the `` contamination '' of the correlator by the excited states .",
    "the ope series is the expansion of @xmath11 at small euclidean time @xmath18 : @xmath22 for @xmath11 this expansion is equivalent to the expansion in powers of the interaction @xmath23 .",
    "the first term in ( [ piope ] ) , @xmath24 , does not depend on the interaction and describes the free propagation of the constituents .",
    "the rest of the series represents power corrections : @xmath25 @xmath24 may be written as the spectral integral @xcite @xmath26 with @xmath27 the spectral density of the one - loop two - point feynman diagram of the nonrelativistic field theory @xcite .",
    "the basic quantity for the extraction of the form factor in the method of dispersive sum rules is the correlator of three currents @xcite .",
    "the analogue of this quantity in quantum mechanics reads @xcite @xmath28 [ with the operator @xmath8 defined in ( [ j ] ) ] and its double borel ( laplace ) transform under @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 for large @xmath32 and @xmath33 the correlator is dominated by the ground state : @xmath34 let us notice the ward identity which relates the vertex function at zero momentum to the polarization operator : @xmath35 this expression follows directly from the current - conservation relation @xmath36 let us consider the vertex function for equal times @xmath37 , which in the ho model explicitly reads @xmath38 the correlator @xmath39 is a function of two dimensionless variables @xmath13 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding average energy is defined as follows : @xmath42 the contribution of the ground state to the correlator , @xmath43 , in the ho model has the form @xmath44 the relative contribution of the ground state to @xmath45 and @xmath46 are shown in fig .",
    "[ plot:1 ] : independently of the value of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 for large @xmath18 .",
    "notice , however , that the saturation of the correlator by the ground state is delayed to later @xmath18 with the growth of @xmath47 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure  [ plot:7 ] compares the extraction of the ground - state decay constant from the two - point function in the potential model ( left column ) and in qcd ( right column ) .",
    "for the potential model , we consider the interaction consisting of a confining ho part and a coulomb part and make use of the ope which includes the radiative corrections up to order @xmath50 and several lowest - order power corrections .",
    "this corresponds to the best known ope for the two - point function of heavy - light quark currents @xcite which we use for qcd .",
    "details of this analysis including the specific values of the numerical parameters can be found in @xcite ; they are not essential for our purpose here .    from fig .",
    "[ plot:7 ] it becomes evident that  with respect to the _ extraction _ of the ground - state parameters  there are no essential differences between qcd and quantum mechanics : as soon as the parameters of the lagrangian are fixed , and the truncated ope is calculated with a reasonable accuracy ( taking into account also the relevant choice of the renormalization scale in qcd ) , the extraction procedures are very similar .    at first glance",
    ", this similarity might look surprising since the structure of bound states in quantum - mechanical potential models and in qcd are rather different .",
    "however , the method of dispersive sum rules does not make use of the details of the ground - state structure .",
    "what really matters for extracting the ground - state parameters by this method is ( i ) the way one implements the quark - hadron duality and ( ii ) the structure of the ope for a given correlator .",
    "therefore , it should not be surprising that the extraction procedures in potential models and in qcd are similar , as soon as quark - hadron duality is implemented in both theories in the same way by a cut on the spectral representation for the correlators .    in the potential model",
    ", the actual value of the decay constant belongs to the band provided by the linear and the quadratic anstze for the effective continuum threshold .",
    "it seems very likely that the same happens in qcd , at least this may be taken as a realistic conjecture .",
    "perhaps even more important is that studying the @xmath51-dependent parameterizations for the effective threshold allows one to probe the magnitude of the intrinsic , i.e. , systematic , uncertainty of the extracted decay constant .",
    "interestingly , the systematic uncertainties of the ground - state parameters are probed solely by the ope , without making use of the information about the excited states of the hadron spectrum .",
    "the intrinsic uncertainty should be taken into account along with the `` usual '' uncertainty obtained in the method of qcd sum rules by the variation of the input qcd parameters ; while the latter is going to decrease when increasing the accuracy of these parameters , e.g. , @xmath52 , the systematic uncertainty does not depend on the input qcd parameters and remains at the same level .",
    "we studied the extraction of the ground - state form factor from the vacuum - to - vacuum and vacuum - to - hadron correlators .",
    "let us summarize the main messages of our analysis :    * the knowledge of the correlator in a limited range of relatively small euclidean times @xmath18 ( i.e. , large borel masses ) is not sufficient for the determination of the ground - state parameters .",
    "in addition to the ope for the relevant correlator , one needs an independent criterion for fixing the effective continuum threshold . * assuming a @xmath18-independent ( i.e. , a borel - parameter - independent ) effective continuum threshold , the error of the extracted dual form factor @xmath53 turns out to be typically much larger than the variation of @xmath54 in the borel window .",
    "therefore the standard procedures based on the borel stability adopted in the method of sum rules do not allow one to obtain realistic error estimates for the extracted form factor ; eventually the actual error of the extracted form factor may happen to be much larger . * in those cases where the ground - state energy ( mass ) is known , considerable improvements may be achieved by allowing for a @xmath18-dependent effective continuum threshold and finding its parameters by minimizing the deviation of the energy of the dual correlator from the known value of the ground - state energy , eq .",
    "( [ chisq ] ) .",
    "first , the actual accuracy of the extracted form factor is considerably improved .",
    "second , the spread between form - factor  values obtained with different @xmath18-dependent anstze for @xmath55 provides a realistic error of the form factor .",
    "* we have demonstrated the striking similarity  not only qualitatively but , more importantly , also quantitatively  between the extraction procedures in the quantum - mechanical potential model and in qcd .",
    "this similarity is the consequence of the same way of implementing the quark - hadron duality in both theories .",
    "the established similarity strongly suggests that the results on the extraction of ground - state form factors obtained in potential models have direct implications for the corresponding analyses in qcd and should be taken very seriously .",
    "+ although a rigorous  in the mathematical sense  control over the systematic errors of the extracted hadron parameters remains unfeasible , the proposed modifications related to the borel - parameter - dependent effective continuum threshold promise a considerable increase of the _ actual _ accuracy of the method of sum rules and opens the possibility to obtain _ realistic _",
    "estimates for the systematic errors .",
