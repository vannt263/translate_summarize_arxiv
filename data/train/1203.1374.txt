    "it recently came to our attention that the _ stability _ of high - reynolds-number atomistic shear flows@xcite apparently contradicts the _ instability _ predicted by a perturbation analysis@xcite of the navier - stokes - fourier equations for steady compressible heat - conducting simple shear . here",

    "iv we apply several versions of the continuum perturbation theory to this soft - disk constitutive model .",
    "the results of that theory are contradicted by the existing molecular dynamics results .",
    "section v sums up the current state of our knowledge , emphasizing the open problem which remains unsolved .",
    "steady homogeneous shear flows with periodic boundaries would seem to be the simplest conceivable nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "figure 1 shows a particle snapshot taken from a typical molecular dynamics simulation . in that figure the central cell , containing @xmath0 two - dimensional particles ,",
    "is repeated periodically in space .",
    "periodic images to the right and to the left are generated by adding or subtracting multiples of the cell side length @xmath1 to all the particle coordinate values from the central cell .",
    "100-particle images just above the central cell move to the right with an additional velocity @xmath2 relative to the central row of cells .",
    "images just below that row likewise move to the left with an additional velocity @xmath3 .",
    "these periodic boundaries impose a shear strain rate and a corresponding stress on _ all _ cells .",
    "the _ strain rate _",
    "@xmath4 defined and imposed by these periodic boundary conditions is the overall macroscopic velocity gradient : @xmath5    such early 100-particle studies from the 1970s were , by the 1990s , augmented by larger - scale simulations with as many as @xmath6 particles@xcite .",
    "these _ steady - state _ flows , in which the heat generated by the shearing motion is extracted by `` thermostat '' ( or ergostat ) forces , established that the measured shear viscosity , at fixed strain rate , is insensitive to system size .",
    "consider a prototypical dense soft - disk fluid , with @xmath7 and a short - ranged repulsive pair interaction @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath9 greater than 64 the shear viscosity has only a small `` size dependence '' .",
    "for a fixed strain rate the finite-@xmath9 viscosity @xmath10 approaches the large - system limit from below .",
    "the @xmath9-dependent deviations from the limiting viscosity , @xmath11 , are of order @xmath12 .",
    "the deviation is about two percent for @xmath13 and is negligible , relative to statistical fluctuations , for systems with @xmath9 of order @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "one might well expect , by analogy with macroscopic three - dimensional hydrodynamic flows@xcite , that a _ turbulent _ instability would appear at a reynolds number of the order of a thousand , @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , detailed investigations , for thermostated two - dimensional flows with reynolds numbers as large as 50,000 , showed _ no instability whatever_. these molecular dynamics simulations showed instead that steady two - dimensional dense - fluid shear flows are stable .",
    "these results were announced in 1995 in two papers by author bill and harald posch , `` large - system hydrodynamic limit '' and `` shear viscosity _ via _ global control of spatiotemporal chaos in two - dimensional isoenergetic dense fluids '' .    soon afterward two papers suggesting a long - wavelength exponential _",
    "instability _ of _ all _ such flows appeared in the condensed matter arxiv : `` stability of uniform shear flow '' and `` long wavelength instability for uniform shear flow '' , by jim dufty , mirim lee , jim lutsko , jos montanero , and andrs santos@xcite .",
    "these papers considered linear perturbations of the density , velocity , and energy fields from the standpoint of the navier - stokes - fourier equations , specialized to small strain rates @xmath4 and to long wavelengths ( or small @xmath16 vector ) normal to the flow direction @xmath17 .",
    "their analysis showed that for _ any _ fixed strain rate exponential growth invariably results for perturbations of sufficiently long wavelength .    in early 2012",
    "we chanced upon these contradictory results [ _ stable _ molecular dynamics and _ unstable _ linear perturbation theory , both for the _ same _ problem ] . to address this puzzle here",
    "we first investigated solutions of gas - phase navier - stokes - fourier shear flows with moving periodic images of a square eulerian continuum grid , using the same periodic - shear boundary conditions illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the finite - difference numerical work@xcite is most naturally carried out for grid space and time differences @xmath18 and @xmath19 chosen near the courant condition limit , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the fluid s sound speed .",
    "the equations to be solved are minor modifications of the usual conservation laws for mass , momentum , and energy : @xmath22 the boundaries , where the square middle - row cells of figure 1 contact the upper and lower rows of cells , need to be made consistent with steady shear .",
    "here @xmath23 is the mass density , @xmath24 is the velocity , @xmath25 is the pressure tensor , @xmath26 the energy per unit mass , and @xmath27 the heat flux vector .",
    "the superior dots indicate  comoving \"  lagrangian \" time derivatives following the motion .",
    "an efficient algorithm solving this problem can be based on those developed for the rayleigh - bnard continuum convection problems described in references 5 , 8 , and 9 .    in the continuum periodic - shear",
    "algorithm we added a  global \" ergostat to the energy equation to constrain the total internal energy .",
    "we also added two global `` thermostats '' to the continuum equations of motion .",
    "these thermostats constrained the summed - up squares of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 velocity fluctuations to small constant values , relative to the mean simple - shear motion @xmath30 .",
    "we also included a short - ranged `` artificial viscosity '' to avoid an `` even - odd '' instability .",
    "the one - dimensional analog of this instability would lead to alternating signs for velocities evaluated at neighboring nodes of a periodic computation mesh with @xmath9 zones defined by @xmath9 nodes . at the end of each timestep",
    "the @xmath31th _ nodal _ velocity is replaced by a weighted average @xmath32 including the _ zone _ velocities of its neighboring zones : @xmath33    the two - dimensional periodic shear problem is implemented with densities evaluated in @xmath9 computational square @xmath34 zones with velocities and energies evaluated at the nodes defining the four corners of the zones .",
    "fourth - order runge - kutta integration of the @xmath35 ordinary finite - difference equations results in a natural strain rate , @xmath36 the factor 2 reflects the two increments of time occuring in a single runge - kutta time step .",
    "this strain rate is of the same order as the @xmath16 vector describing the longest - wavelength perturbation : @xmath37 and is also fairly close to the critical wavelength of the instability analyses .",
    "a typical @xmath38 zone simulation , with @xmath39 \\ ; \\ ] ] @xmath40 \\ , \\ ] ] corresponds to a shear flow with a reynolds number @xmath41 and is perfectly stable , for a run time of @xmath42 steps of 0.25 each , corresponding to a total shear of 50 .",
    "we carried out a variety of simulations .",
    "time - dependent data from one of them are shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the kinetic energy history , after an irregular transient , is typical , with nearly periodic oscillations of the horizontal and vertical velocity deviations from simple shear flow [ these deviations are rescaled at the conclusion of each timestep ]",
    ". the deviations are analogous to thermal fluctuations .",
    "figure 3 shows these same fluctuations as arrows .",
    "these patterns are not stationary , but vary with time . because the time periodicity of the shear , with period @xmath43 , is built into the boundary conditions an inhomogeneous perturbation flow is to be expected .",
    "we explored systems with @xmath44 computational zones , with @xmath1 = 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 , and 512 to strains of at least 100 . with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , so that the reynolds number is @xmath47 , all members of this series were stable , giving results similar to those in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "somewhat larger or smaller values of @xmath19 typically led to instability , making it difficult to validate the stability work of references 6 and 7 .",
    "these exploratory calculations could be extended in _",
    "arbitrary ways .",
    "we chose instead to follow and extend the linear perturbation - theory hard - sphere work of dufty _",
    "et alii_@xcite directly to a numerical model based on our earlier soft - disk shear - flow model .",
    "our results , described in what follows , suggest that the linear perturbation analysis yields flawed predictions , contradicted by the well - established stability of thermostated simple shear in two space dimensions@xcite . despite our efforts to extend the perturbation analyses , described below ,",
    "a convincing theoretical demonstration of this finding remains a challenging research goal .",
    "it seems likely that the flaw in the perturbation treatment is an inadequate treatment of steady - state thermostating .",
    "our checks of the other aspects of the perturbation theory have so far revealed no errors .",
    "the short - ranged repulsive potential @xmath48 has been carefully investigated near the reference state , @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath26 is the energy per particle and each particle has unit mass@xcite .",
    "the equilibrium temperature and pressure at that state are approximately @xmath50 = 0.69 and @xmath25 = 3.90 . for our numerical stability studies",
    "we adopt the equation of state from reference 3 : @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 we estimate the transport coefficients ( and evaluate their density and temperature derivatives numerically ) @xmath54 from enskog s theory@xcite .",
    "enskog suggested that transport properties for soft potentials be estimated from those of a corresponding hard - potential model .",
    "the equivalence is based on setting the soft model s `` thermal pressure '' , @xmath55 , equal to the hard - potential pressure . in our two - dimensional implementation the hard - disk model corresponding to the soft - disk potential @xmath56 follows from the relation : @xmath57 for the hard - disk compressibility factor we use the ten - term virial series from clisby and mccoy s work@xcite : @xmath58_{\\rm soft } \\equiv ( p/\\rho t)_{\\rm hard } = 1 + ( b\\rho)\\chi = 1 + b\\rho + 0.782(b\\rho)^2 + 0.532(b\\rho)^3 + \\ ] ] @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the ratio of the actual hard - disk collision rate from the virial series to the low - density kinetic - theory collision rate calculated with the two - term series .",
