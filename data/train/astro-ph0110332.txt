    "these authors classified the donor star by comparing its absorption features with the same features seen in k - type template stars .",
    "kraft ( 1964 ) , gallagher & oinas ( 1974 ) and reinsch ( 1994 ) obtained consistent classifications ; k2ivp , k2ivp - k2v , and k2v or k3v respectively .",
    "kraft ( 1964 ) and gallagher & oinas ( 1974 ) noted changes in the line ratios from spectrum to spectrum throughout their observing campaign and the classification they gave was the mean spectral type of all the observations .",
    "the spectral type of the secondary as measured by crampton  ( 1986 ) ( k0iii - k0iv ) is not consistent with those of the authors mentioned above .",
    "moreover , crampton ( 1986 ) conclude that phase - related spectral changes seen by previous authors are not present in their own data .",
    "the spectra of  and the k - type templates presented here were binned into constant velocity bins .",
    "we used the fit to the orbital radial velocity of the secondary calculated in section 3.2 ( systemic velocity @xmath13=40.8 , radial velocity semi - amplitude of the companion k@xmath0=120.5 ) to shift out the orbital motion of the absorption lines with a quadratic rebinning algorithm .",
    "the   spectra from each night were then binned into two orbital phase intervals to investigate the possible changes in spectral and luminosity classes of the secondary at different orbital phases .",
    "we selected the regions where there were mostly - uncontaminated absorption features , i.e. regions containing obvious emission lines ( @xmath1042654399 , @xmath1044354484 , @xmath1045034553 , @xmath1046204727 , @xmath1048424878 , and @xmath1049104935 ) were masked out from the data .    in order to classify the secondary star , an optimal subtraction method ( marsh , robinson & wood 1994 )",

    "the assumption is that the correctly - scaled template spectrum is a good representation of the secondary star and the most intrinsically - smooth residual is a good representation of the accretion flow spectrum .",

    "this spectral classification of the secondary is close to previous studies of  during quiescence .",
    "this result does not fit within the spectral class - orbital period relation fit by smith & dhillon ( 1998 ) .",
    "this may indicate that the secondary star in  is not a main - sequence star , which is not surprising as basic evolutionary theories tell us that one should not find a main - sequence star in a cv with an orbital period much longer than @xmath159 hours ( patterson 1984 ) .",
    "the int data covers approximately the same orbital phases as the 1996 outburst data analysed in msr96 and msr99 .",
    "the template star nearest in spectral class to the donor during outburst at phases , @xmath16 0.140.18 and @xmath16 0.640.68 is also a k1iv star ( msr99 ) .",
    "the secondary star shows the same spectral class during both outburst and quiescence at those particular phases .",
    "furthermore , there is no convincing evidence for the rapid spectral changes reported by kraft ( 1964 ) and gallagher & oinas ( 1974 ) .",
    "the continuum was subtracted from individual spectra by masking wavelength regions with major emission lines , fitting a spline with 3 knots and subtracting the fits from the  spectra . for the template ,",
    "a two - knot spline fit was subtracted .",
    "the spectra were binned in velocity to ensure that all covered the same wavelength region and had the same logarithmic dispersion .",
    "emission line regions remained masked out and the absorption lines of  were cross - correlated ( tonry & davis 1979 ) against those of the k1iv template .",
    "the template spectrum was broadened by the value of v@xmath17 i obtained in section .",

    "this is an iterative process because to measure v@xmath17 i we need to know k@xmath0 .",

    "( 100,0)(10,20 ) ( 0,0 )    cross - correlation of the absorption lines of  and the broadened template yielded the radial velocities of the secondary star in the binary , relative to that of the k1iv template used .",
    "the radial velocities obtained were then shifted to account for the radial velocity of hd197964 ; @xmath196.5  kms@xmath9 ( evans 1979 ) .",
    "we combined these results with previously published radial velocities ( kraft 1964 , crampton  1986 , and reinsch 1994 ) , all obtained during quiescence and carried out a search for periodicities using the lomb - scargle algorithm ( scargle 1982 ) .",

    "this value for k@xmath0 is consistent within 1-@xmath23 with that obtained from the combined data . for clarity we plot two orbits in fig .  [ donor : rv : quiescence : fig2 ] .",
    "our data is plotted only once so it is easier to see how good the fit is for previously published data .",
    "we noticed that between orbital phases 0.4  0.8 the previously published data shows large deviations from the fit to all the data .",
    "this is not surprising considering that the radial velocity measurements were done using different radial velocity standards , of different spectral types in some cases .",
    "we mentioned before that kraft ( 1964 ) had noticed spectral changes in the secondary during his observations which could have been caused by irradiation of the secondary .",
    "this would explain the deviations from the fit observed .",
    "for this reason we have decided to adopt as the best solution the fit to only our data , as it was obtained from a consistent dataset .",
    "a second - order sinusoidal fit has been found in the past to provide a statistically more - significant fit than a circular one .",
    "this results from the irradiation of a fraction of the stellar surface ( friend  1990 ) .",
    "such a fit in this case provides no significant eccentricity , verifying we have not detected an irradiated atmosphere in this data .",

    "although they used only  because the variations in the radial velocities for the other emission lines showed more scatter , it is clear from their fig .  3 that even the scatter in  gives a very unreliable fit . adopting the emission line velocity to be the same as the white dwarf requires the assumption that the disc emits axisymmetrically , however there are many examples where this is not the case ( kaitchuck  1994 ) .",
    "axisymmetry can generally be minimised by sampling the velocities of the high velocity line wings only since the inner disk is expected to be more axisymmetric than the outer ( marsh 1988 ) and we apply this method to .",
    "we use the double - gaussian convolution technique of schneider & young ( 1980 ) .",
    "this convolves each continuum - subtracted , logarithmically - rebinned spectrum with two gaussians of identical width , fwhm = 200  kms@xmath9 , and of separations varying systematically between 400 and 3000  kms@xmath9 .",

    "[ quiescence : wdrv : fig1 ] .",
    "faster gas velocities are sampled as the gaussian separation increases .",
    "the value of k@xmath29 depends sensitively on the segment of line that is sampled .",
    "commonly , k@xmath30 is considered to coincide with k@xmath29 when k@xmath29 is stable over a range of gaussian separations , i.e. @xmath31  in this case , or at the point just before @xmath32 increases sharply , i.e. at a gaussian separation of @xmath15900  wich corresponds to @xmath1540  in this instance .",
    "the actual radial velocities and the fits obtained are plotted in fig .",
    "[ quiescence : wdrv : fig2 ] for measurements taken when the gaussian separation is 900 .",
    "another approach to the diagnostic diagram is the light centres method ( marsh 1988 ) in which we plot the radial velocities measured in velocity space , extrapolate the line of points obtained to the k@xmath33 axis and read off the value . using this method",
    "we find k@xmath34  for  and 0  for  ( see fig .",
    "[ quiescence : wdrv : fig3 ] ) .",
    "however , both approaches are not particularly justified and we find it impossible to determine k@xmath35 from these measurements .      fortunately , if we make the assumption that the secondary stars rotation is tidally - locked to the orbital period we can determine the mass ratio of the binary using only the projected radial velocity semi - amplitude and rotational velocity of the secondary ( section  [ donor : vsini : q ] ) .",
    "this rotational quantity can be measured from the width of the absorption lines .",
    "calculation of the masses of the components of binary systems from v@xmath2 measurements is considered a more accurate method than measuring the emission line velocities , although bleach  ( 2000 ) provide some caveats .",
    "we used the radial velocity fit obtained in section  3.2 to subtract the orbital velocity of the absorption features in , and averaged the continuum subtracted spectra for each night .",
    "we convolved the k1iv template spectrum with a broadening function in which we include a linear limb - darkening coefficient of 0.53 ( gray 1992 ; van hamme , 1993 ) , obtaining a series of templates corresponding to v@xmath36 = 5150  kms@xmath9 .",
    "then we applied the same optimal subtraction technique as in section  3.1 to find which broadened templates best matched the lines in the average spectrum .",
    "this technique has been applied by many authors to close binary systems ( e.g. southwell , 1995 ; marsh , 1994 ; drew , jones & woods , 1993 ; friend , 1990 ) .",
    "the int and mcdonald spectra yielded v@xmath37 i = 64.3 @xmath1 11.0  kms@xmath9 , and 58.7 @xmath1 14.2  kms@xmath9 respectively .",
    "we adopt v@xmath2 = 61.5 @xmath1 11.8  kms@xmath9 , the mean of the values found for the quiescent data .",
    "( 100,0)(10,20 ) ( 0,0 )    from k@xmath0= 120.5 @xmath1 0.7 , measured in section  3.2 , we can obtain a value for the mass function of white dwarf of 0.362 @xmath1 0.006 m@xmath38 using : @xmath39    in section  [ emission ] we defined the stellar mass ratio @xmath7 , where @xmath40 the rotational , @xmath41 , and radial velocity semi - amplitude , @xmath42 , of the secondary star are related by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the spherically - averaged roche lobe radius of the companion star , scaled to the stellar separation .",

    ", we obtain a lower limit for the mass of the white dwarf of m@xmath35 = 0.87 @xmath1 0.24m@xmath38 . combining this value with @xmath7",

    "reinsch ( 1994 ) observed  at orbital phases during which potential eclipses would happen but did not measure any eclipse effects in the line wings .",
    "this implies that the white dwarf and inner accretion region are not eclipsed .",
