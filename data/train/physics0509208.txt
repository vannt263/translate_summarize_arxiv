    "recently , response maxima in time modulated turbulence have been predicted within a mean field theory of turbulence @xcite .",
    "subsequently , such response maxima were found @xcite in numerical simulations of simplified dynamical turbulence models such as the  goy model @xcite or the reduced wave vector approximation ( rewa ) @xcite .",
    "however , these response maxima computed in @xcite were not pronounced at all , due to the approximate treatment of the small scales in either of these approaches .",
    "indications of response maxima resulting from time - modulated forcing have subsequently also been seen in experiment @xcite .",
    "the  experimental observations were done by introducing a time - dependent swirl to fluid in a closed container and monitoring the energy - dissipation - rate . the selected set - up did not allow to identify possible flow - structuring under resonance conditions , nor to conclusively distinguish such resonance phenomena from flow - organization associated with the  size of  the  container .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to complement these theoretical , numerical , and experimental observations by direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of turbulence , subject to time - modulated large - scale forcing . in a turbulent flow",
    "whose large - scale forcing is periodically modulated in time , all typical flow - properties develop a complex time - dependence . however , averaging such turbulent time - dependence , conditioned on the phase of the periodic modulation , yields a clear and much simpler periodic pattern @xcite",
    ". the dependence of the conditionally averaged response on the frequency of the modulation may be quantified by monitoring changes in flow - properties such as total energy , dissipation - rate , or taylor - reynolds number . in case of  a  fast modulation with a  frequency @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the inverse large eddy turnover time , only a modest effect on the flow is expected , or none at all . likewise ,",
    "if @xmath4 the modulation is quasi - stationary and the flow may be expected to closely resemble the  corresponding unmodulated case . in between these extremes a more pronounced response may develop , which is the  subject of this investigation .",
    "the dns approach allows to investigate in detail the response of turbulent flow - properties to periodic modulation of the forcing .",
    "in particular , we present an extensive parameter - study involving a large range of modulation frequencies for two different reynolds numbers , and  establish response maxima in a variety of flow - properties . the response is found to be significantly increased at modulation frequencies on the order of the inverse of the eddy - turnover time . near resonance ,",
    "the ` activity ' of the turbulent flow is found to be considerably higher than in the unmodulated case . at high frequencies @xmath0",
    "the  amplitude of the  modulation - specific response of the kinetic energy is found to uniformly decrease to zero as @xmath5 .",
    "this type of external control of turbulence may offer new opportunities with relevance to technological applications .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first introduce the computational flow - model in more detail .",
    "subsequently , an overview of the ensemble averaging procedure and  data extraction is given .",
    "then the main result , the response of various flow properties to time - modulated forcing , is presented .",
    "the paper ends with a summary and conclusions .",
    "the full navier - stokes equations for incompressible flow are numerically solved in a periodic flow - domain with a pseudo - spectral code . in spectral space ,",
    "the  navier - stokes equations read @xmath6u_\\alpha ( { \\bf{k}},t ) = m_{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma } ( { \\bf{k}})\\sum\\limits_{{\\bf{p } } + { \\bf{q } } = { \\bf{k } } } { u_\\beta({\\bf{p}},t)u_\\gamma   ( { \\bf{q}},t ) } + f_\\alpha ( { \\bf{k}},t),\\ ] ] with @xmath7 , with @xmath8 . here , @xmath9 is the  kinematic viscosity , @xmath10 is the fourier - coefficient of the velocity field at wave vector @xmath11 and time @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the time - modulated forcing .",
    "first , we recall that traditional agitation of the large - scale structures in a turbulent flow may be achieved by introducing a forcing term restricted to wave vectors with , i.e. , identifying a forcing - range through the upper - limit @xmath14 .",
    "specifically , we force the turbulence similarly as in @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the constant energy injection rate and @xmath17 is the total number of forced modes . for convenience",
    ", the wave vectors are grouped in spherical shells with the @xmath18-th shell containing all modes such that @xmath19 ( i.e. , @xmath20 which implies @xmath21 , the case considered in @xcite ) or in the first two shells ( i.e. , @xmath22 which implies @xmath23 ) .",
    "the second step in specifying the forcing @xmath24 introduces the periodic time modulation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the amplitude of modulation and @xmath0 its angular frequency .",
    "the modulated forcing corresponds to a total energy input rate which oscillates around @xmath27 with amplitude @xmath26 , @xmath28 the lengths and time scales of the numerical simulation are chosen by picking @xmath29 for the  box - size in physical space and @xmath30 for the energy injection rate .",
    "the reynolds number is then determined by the dimensionless viscosity @xmath9 . choosing @xmath31 and @xmath32 result in respective approximate taylor - reynolds numbers @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we use these two cases as references denoted by @xmath35 and @xmath36 . the spatial resolution needed",
    "may be estimated by requiring @xmath37 @xcite with @xmath38 the  kolmogorov dissipation scale and @xmath39 the  highest wavenumber included in the spatial discretization .",
    "for  @xmath35 case a  resolution of  at  least @xmath40 computational points is required while for  @xmath36 a  higher resolution of @xmath41 points is necessary .",
    "the  latter poses a  strong computational challenge in view of the extensive ensemble averaging and large number of modulation frequencies .",
    "however , it was found that many large scale quantities , such as the total energy , do not depend too sensitively on resolution . as an example",
    ", a  resolution of @xmath42 points corresponds to @xmath43 for the @xmath36 case .",
    "still , this resolution is quite adequate for studying the response of total energy .",
    "this was verified by repeating the analysis at a selection of modulation frequencies with resolutions @xmath44 and @xmath41 .",
    "the predictions of  quantities that rely more on small scales , such as the dissipation - rate , contain a higher numerical uncertainty for @xmath36 case and @xmath42 computational points , but  still allow a  clear interpretation of the main turbulence response .",
    "this was separately assessed using the  higher resolution data at selected characteristic frequencies .",
    "the direct numerical simulation for the unmodulated case starts from an initial condition that was generated on the basis of the pao spectrum @xcite .",
    "we adopt exactly the same initial conditions as in @xcite which allow a separate validation of the simulations .",
    "explicit second order compact - storage runge - kutta time - stepping @xcite with fully de - aliased pseudo - spectral discretization is used .",
    "the  unmodulated turbulent flows provide the point of reference for investigating the effect of modulated forcing , to which we turn next .",
    "in order to analyze the response to a  time - modulated forcing , the precise extraction of the amplitude and phase of the conditionally averaged variations is a key issue .",
    "two steps can be distinguished , i.e. , the computation of  the  conditionally averaged signal itself and the subsequent determination of amplitude and phase characteristics of this signal , see figure  [ fig : timemod0 ] .",
    "these steps are discussed and illustrated next .    , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and phase - shifts @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 of the forcing @xmath50 ( dashed line ) , the energy @xmath51 ( labeled  @xmath52 ) , and the energy - dissipation - rate @xmath53 ( labeled  @xmath54 ) normalized by their respective means @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 obtained from simulations at the modulation frequency @xmath58 ( b).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0%](a ) , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and phase - shifts @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 of the forcing @xmath50 ( dashed line ) , the energy @xmath51 ( labeled  @xmath52 ) , and the energy - dissipation - rate @xmath53 ( labeled  @xmath54 ) normalized by their respective means @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 obtained from simulations at the modulation frequency @xmath58 ( b).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0%](b )    we adopt ensemble averaging to determine the conditionally averaged signal @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the total energy @xmath61 , the taylor - reynolds number @xmath62 or the energy dissipation rate @xmath63 .",
    "ensemble averaging requires a sufficiently large sample of statistically independent signals @xmath64 to be generated .",
    "the computational approach is summarized in figure  [ fig : timemod0](a ) and involves two main steps .",
    "firstly , we compute the unmodulated flow and store @xmath65 realizations of the turbulent solution corresponding to @xmath66",
    ". the latter condition allows transients related to the initial condition to become negligible .",
    "the time - separation between these snapshots is larger than two eddy - turnover times .",
    "subsequently , each of these @xmath67 realizations was taken as the initial condition for a simulation with time - modulated forcing at a particular frequency @xmath0 .",
    "this provides @xmath67 sample signals which need to be averaged to obtain the conditionally averaged signal @xmath59 .",
    "repeating this procedure for a range of frequencies yields the total response characteristics .",
    "given the conditionally averaged response signal @xmath59 , there are various ways in which amplitude and phase information can be extracted . in @xcite",
    "the signal @xmath59 was first averaged over time to yield @xmath68 .",
    "subsequently , the normalized variation defined as @xmath69 was studied using the fourier - transform  ( @xmath70 ) in which time @xmath12 is transformed into frequency @xmath71 .",
    "correspondingly , the power amplitude spectrum @xmath72 can be obtained which assumes a maximum value @xmath73 , as denoted in figure  [ fig : timemod0](b ) for forcing @xmath74 , total energy @xmath45 , and energy - dissipation - rate @xmath75 .",
    "the  maximum @xmath76 as the amplitude at dominant frequency can be used to quantify the response as function of the modulation frequency  @xmath0 .",
    "this  approach is accurate if fourier - transform is applied to an integer number of modulation periods .",
    "the  method used in @xcite is based on a fitting procedure in which it is assumed that @xmath77 .",
    "the dependence of the parameters @xmath78 on @xmath0 may be obtained from a least squares procedure .",
    "this evaluation method assumes that the conditionally averaged signal has the same frequency as the forcing .    at modest ensemble - size",
    "@xmath67 it is beneficial to explicitly incorporate variations in the unmodulated reference signal to improve the data - evaluation .",
    "this motivates an alternative method in which we determine @xmath67 sample signals @xmath64 corresponding to the modulated case , as well as @xmath67 unmodulated signals @xmath79 that start from the same set of initial conditions .",
    "this allows to generate different ` normalized ' signals such as or @xmath80 .",
    "these normalized signals provide estimates that compensate to some degree for the relatively small number of samples or for an  unknown mean component but have the drawback that they can not be applied in the context of a physical experiment .",
    "additionally , we divided these signals by its means ( time - averages ) and removed the constant component corresponding to the  zero - frequency response .",
    "application of the  fourier - transform , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , provides direct access to amplitude and phase information .",
    "each of these methods identified above yields the same general impression of response maxima in time - modulated turbulence .",
    "differences arise only on a more detailed level of the processed data but these do not obscure the interpretation of the main features of the response .",
    "therefore we only present results extracted from the normalized signal @xmath83 in what follows , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "the simulations were performed in the frequency range @xmath84 with time - modulated forcing at an amplitude @xmath85 .",
    "referring to figure  [ fig : timemod0 ] , for each of  the  @xmath67 unmodulated initial conditions , @xmath86 periods of the modulated forcing were simulated , i.e. , each sample signal was computed for @xmath87 time - units with modulation - period @xmath88 .",
    "since an explicit time - stepping method was adopted , the cases at low @xmath0 add particularly to the total computational cost .",
    "the number of realizations required in the ensemble was investigated separately .",
    "results for several modulation frequencies were compared at @xmath89 and @xmath90 ; it was found that @xmath91 independent samples provide adequate statistical convergence for our purposes .",
    "we stored @xmath92 points per modulation period and present results obtained by evaluating the last two recorded periods , i.e. , @xmath93 .",
    "comparison with results obtained by evaluating data on @xmath94 yielded only minor differences .",
    "finally , the phase @xmath95 between the forcing and the response can be computed from the fourier - transformed data as well . at the dominant frequency @xmath96 of the transformed signal @xmath97 ,",
    "the phase becomes @xmath98 .     for the @xmath35 case recorded at different modulation frequencies @xmath0",
    "is shown in ( a ) together with the modulation of the forcing @xmath99 ( dashed ) .",
    "the corresponding power spectra of the fourier - transform as function of the transformed frequency @xmath71 are collected in ( b ) .",

    "the inset in ( a ) shows the phase - shift @xmath109 between the  energy response and the forcing modulation.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0%](b )    we now focus on the amplitude of the total energy response as function of the modulation frequency @xmath0 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath110 computed as maximum of the fourier - transformed normalized signal for each modulation frequency is shown in figure  [ fig : eande](a ) .",
    "the maximum response appears at @xmath111 , in accordance with the  expectation @xcite that it should be close to the  inverse large eddy turnover time .",
    "in addition , the  location of  the  maximum is not very sensitive to @xmath112 , reflecting that the  response maximum is mainly associated with the  large - scale features in the  flow . at  high modulation frequencies",
    "@xmath113 the decay of @xmath114 is proportional to @xmath5 , which becomes particularly visible in the compensated response @xmath115 , figure  [ fig : eande](b ) . at  very low modulation frequencies",
    "@xmath116 a plateau in @xmath110 must of course develop @xcite , as the turbulence then completely follows the forcing .",
    "our simulations do not achieve small enough @xmath0 to observe a pronounced plateau .",
    "the maximum of @xmath117 is about @xmath118 higher as compared to the value at high @xmath0 .",
    "this is as expected lower than predicted by the mean - field theory described in @xcite as the fluctuations slightly smear out the mean - field maximum , but it is much more pronounced compared to results based on the goy or rewa simulations @xcite .",
    "the reason is that , although the  appearance of the  response maxima is a  large - scale effect , the  correct resolution of the  small - scales is important for a  proper quantitative representation of the effect , because the small scale resolution affects the energy flux downscale .",
    "we also calculated the  response curves for the  taylor - reynolds number ; the results are quite similar .     and ( b ) compensated energy - dissipation - rate response @xmath119 obtained for the @xmath35 case . the inset in ( a ) shows the phase - shift @xmath120 between the energy - dissipation response and the forcing modulation.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0%](a )   and ( b ) compensated energy - dissipation - rate response @xmath119 obtained for the @xmath35 case .",
    "the inset in ( a ) shows the phase - shift @xmath120 between the energy - dissipation response and the forcing modulation.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0%](b )    the phase - difference between the forcing modulation and the  conditionally averaged total energy response is shown in figure  [ fig : eande](a ) as inset .",
    "we observe a strong variation in this phase - difference for modulation frequencies near the most responsive modulation frequency .",
    "it  appears that the  maximum response as shown in figure  [ fig : eande ] occurs at a modulation frequency where also the variation in the  phase - difference is largest .",
    "a  strong phase shift was found similarly in windtunnel experiments in which a  time - modulation is introduced via a  periodic cycling of an upstream active grid . in these experiments the maximum response was found to shift to higher frequencies in case the characteristic length - scales of the forcing were reduced .",
    "can such a dependence on the type of  forcing also be observed in our numerical simulations ? to find out we force a  higher wavenumber band of modes ( @xmath121 ) instead of  restricting us entirely to low wavenumber forcing .",
    "the  result is seen in figure  [ fig : eande](b ) indicated by diamonds .",
    "indeed , for this type of  forcing the  response maximum is less pronounced .",
    "further quantitative connections with physical experiments are currently being investigated .",
    "the energy - dissipation - rate in the system is a  quantity that is accessible to direct physical experimentation . in figure",
    "[ fig : epsandeps ] we show the energy - dissipation - rate amplitude @xmath46 .",
    "we notice that at high modulation frequency @xmath0 the amplitude approaches zero , consistent with the expectation that the  modulation of the forcing is not effective in this range .",
    "more importantly , the  energy - dissipation - rate amplitude displays a strong response maximum at the level of @xmath122 compared to the amplitude of modulation .",
    "the  total mean energy - dissipation @xmath123 for each modulation frequency @xmath0 is almost constant .",
    "it differs from the energy input rate @xmath124 at the level of @xmath125 for most of the frequencies , reaching the maximum difference of @xmath126 for the lowest simulated frequency , confirming good numerical convergence .",
    "the direct numerical simulation of the response of turbulence to time - modulated forcing confirms the existence of a response maximum .",
    "the simulation findings are in general agreement with predictions based on a mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "the mean - field theory predicts the decrease of the response amplitude proportional to @xmath5 as the modulation frequency is sufficiently large which was observed in the simulations as well .",
    "the  response maxima in the  total energy and the  taylor - reynolds number occur at the forcing frequencies of the order of the inverse large eddy turnover time scale .",
    "the phase - difference between the modulation of the forcing and the conditionally averaged response displays a strong dependence on the modulation frequency as well .",
    "the  modulation frequency at which the response maximum arises depends only weakly on the  reynolds number but shows a  dependence on the scales included in the forcing as well as on the  flow - property that is considered . in general ,",
    "if the  particular quantity of interest shows a  stronger dependence on the  smaller scales in a  turbulent flow , then the response maximum arises at a  somewhat higher frequency .",
    "these findings may be independently assessed in physical experiments , e.g. , conducted in wind tunnels combined with the  use of active grids cycled in a  periodic sequence @xcite .",
