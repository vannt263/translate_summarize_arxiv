    "the doped holes in nd - doped la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 segregate into periodic stripes that separate antiferromagnetically ordered , hole - poor domains .",
    "lattice distortions pin these stripes , and this pinning is most effective for planar hole concentrations near @xmath8=1/8 where the stripe modulation wavelength is commensurate with the lattice . in the absence of pinning , stripe modulations are presumed to be fluctuating and/or disordered , and this is the emerging picture for la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 ( la-214 ) and yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( y-123)@xcite . we have recently demonstrated , through measurements of thermal conductivity ( @xmath0)@xcite , that both y-123 and hgba@xmath2ca@xmath9cu@xmath10o@xmath11 [ hg-12(@xmath12 - 1)@xmath12 , @xmath12=1 , 2 , 3 ] exhibit doping anomalies near @xmath8=1/8 that can be attributed to the presence of localized charge and associated lattice distortions . here",
    "we discuss the oxygen doping behavior of the anomalies in hg cuprates and present new results on vacancy - free ca - doped yba@xmath2cu@xmath7o@xmath13 ( y-124 ) that suggest elastic properties may reflect stripe dynamics and stripe fragments may pin near oxygen - vacancy clusters .",
    "-3.4 in    the @xmath8=1/8 features ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) are evident in the doping behavior of the normal - state thermal resistivity , @xmath14 , and the normalized change in temperature derivative of @xmath0 that occurs at @xmath1 , @xmath15 [ @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the thermal conductivity in the superconducting ( normal ) state ] . for y-123 , there is a compelling correlation of @xmath18 and @xmath19 with the doping behavior of anomalous @xmath20cu nqr spectral weight@xcite , attributed to localized holes , and the electronic specific heat jump@xcite , @xmath21 , respectively [ crosses in fig.s 1 ( a ) and ( b ) ] . thus @xmath22 probes lattice distortions associated with localized holes , and @xmath23 the change in low - energy spectral weight induced by superconductivity .",
    "since both @xmath23 and @xmath21 provide bulk measures of the superfluid volume , it is significant that the muon spin rotation ( @xmath24sr ) depolarization rate [ @xmath25 in fig .",
    "1 ( b ) ] , proportional to the superfluid density , exhibits no anomalous behavior near 1/8 doping .",
    "the @xmath24sr signal originates in regions of the specimen where there is a flux lattice . the apparent discrepancy between @xmath25 and @xmath23 or @xmath21",
    "is resolved if the material is inhomogeneous , composed of non - superconducting clusters embedded in a superconducting network . the suppression of @xmath23 and @xmath21 below the scaled @xmath25 curve in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) are then measures of the non - superconducting volume fraction . taken together , the @xmath22 and @xmath23 data imply that the non - superconducting regions are comprised of localized holes and associated lattice distortions , i.e. polarons .",
    "it is plausible that these hole - localized regions are stripe domains akin to those inferred from neutron scattering@xcite . that they produce lattice thermal resistance implies they are static on the timescale of the average phonon lifetime , estimated as a few ps in the ab - plane of y-123@xcite .",
    "given that @xmath1 is not substantially suppressed near @xmath8=1/8 implies that these regions do not percolate , and thus the picture is one of small clusters of localized holes and their associated lattice distortions , perhaps no larger than the stripe unit cell ( @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the lattice constant@xcite ) , separated by a distance comparable to the phonon mean free path ( about 100@xmath28 at 100k ) .    for the hg materials the @xmath8=1/8 enhancement of @xmath22 and suppression of @xmath23 is most prominent in single - layer hg-1201 , less so in double - layer hg-1212 , and absent or negligible in three - layer hg-1223 .",
    "this trend follows that of the oxygen vacancy concentration : a single hgo@xmath29 layer per unit cell contributes charge to @xmath12 planes in hg-12(@xmath12 - 1)@xmath12 so that the oxygen vacancy concentration , @xmath30 , increases with decreasing @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the absence of suppression in @xmath23 near 1/8 doping for hg-1223 [ fig .",
    "1  ( d ) ] suggests that this material has sufficiently few localized - hole domains that their effects in @xmath22 and @xmath23 are unobservable .",
    "thus we employ the hg-1223 @xmath18 data as a reference and plot the differences for the other two compounds in fig . 1 ( c ) .",
    "comparing fig.s  1  ( c ) and ( d ) we see that for both hg-1201 and hg-1212 @xmath22 is enhanced and @xmath23 is suppressed relative to values for hg-1223 in common ranges of @xmath8 , with maximal differences near @xmath8=1/8 .",

    "that 1/8 doping anomalies are observed in both y-123 and hg cuprates suggests they are a generic feature of underdoped cuo@xmath2 planes . in this context the doping behavior of @xmath0 for hg-1223 [ fig .",
    "2 ( a ) ] is of interest since it presumably approximates the phase behavior in the absence of localized holes .",
    "we expect the electronic contribution , @xmath31 , to increase smoothly with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "the upturn in @xmath0 above optimal doping ( @xmath8=0.16 ) is presumably attributable to this rising @xmath31 .",
    "the most reliable estimate of @xmath31 in the cuprates comes from thermal hall conductivity measurements@xcite on y-123 which imply @xmath32 for in - plane heat conduction near optimal doping . the data in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) , ( b ) suggest that this ratio is roughly the same in polycrystals , thus motivating the dotted and dashed curves in fig . 2 ( a ) as an educated guess for the electronic and lattice terms , respectively , in hg-1223 .",
    "the lattice conductivity , @xmath33 , predominates in the underdoped regime and is peaked near @xmath8=1/8 .",
    "there is experimental support for the proposal that this peak in @xmath0 is associated with doping - dependent changes in the phonon dispersion which are generic to underdoped cuprates .",
    "figure 2  ( b ) shows the behavior of the normal - state , transverse shear elastic constant ( proportional to the square of the sound velocity ) for single - crystal la-214@xcite , the only material for which doping - dependent measurements for all the main symmetry directions have been reported to our knowledge . a substantial hardening of the lattice in the underdoped regime , with a maximum near @xmath341/8 ,",
    "was observed for all symmetries , indicating that the changes with doping are systemic .",
    "it is possible that the phase behavior of the elastic constants for la-214 and @xmath35 for hg-1223 reflect a renormalization of the lattice dispersion due to changes in stripe dynamics with doping . at @xmath8=1/8",
    "the stripes are maximally commensurate with the lattice , and their fluctuations should be minimal .",
    "enhanced fluctuations are to be expected at higher doping , due to the destabilizing role of repulsive interactions in stripes that neutron scattering results ( yamada _ et al._@xcite ) suggest , are charge compressed . for @xmath361/8 , the cluster spin - glass state observed by @xmath24sr studies@xcite",
    "is characterized by increasing magnetic disorder with decreasing @xmath8 in the range @xmath37 , possibly associated with increasing disorder@xcite in the stripe period .",
    "it is plausible that disorder in the stripe system at both higher and lower doping about @xmath8=1/8 induces a softening of the lattice that is reflected in fig .  2 .",
    "theoretical investigations of elastic coupling to the stripe system would certainly be of interest .",
    "returning now to the enhancement of @xmath22 and suppression of @xmath23 near @xmath8=1/8 , our measurements suggest these phenomena reflect stripe pinning ( or reduced stripe fluctuations ) associated with oxygen vacancy clusters .",
    "raman studies of defect modes in the hg materials@xcite provide a measure of the density of vacancy clusters .",
    "the 590 @xmath38 raman mode in hg cuprates is attributed to c - axis vibrations of apical oxygen in the presence of oxygen vacancies on each of the four nearest - neighbor sites in the hgo@xmath29 layers .",
    "the amount by which the thermal resistivity and @xmath23 values of hg-1201 and hg-1212 differ from those of hg-1223 at @xmath8=1/8 both correlate well with the integrated oscillator strength of this vibrational mode normalized by that of the 570 @xmath38 mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , the latter attributed to apical vibrations in the presence of fewer than four vacancies , and common in the spectra@xcite of all three hg materials . we infer that oxygen - vacancy clusters , of size four or more in the hg cuprates , can pin a stripe fragment .    supporting the role of oxygen vacancies in the observed 1/8 features for y-123 are our recent measurements on oxygen - stoichiometric y@xmath5ca@xmath6 - 124@xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 values for @xmath39=0 , 0.10 , 0.15 are plotted in fig .  1  ( b ) .",
    "there is no evidence for suppression of @xmath23 near 1/8 doping , and the data follow the scaled @xmath24sr curve quite well . within the context of the interpretation we have outlined ,",
    "we conclude that ca substitution for y ( at the level of @xmath40 15% ) is not as effective in stripe pinning as are oxygen vacancy clusters .",
    "it remains to be determined by what mechanism these clusters induce pinning .",
