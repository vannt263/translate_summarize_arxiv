    "one of the most outstanding problems in the fractional quantum hall effect is the unambiguous experimental identification of a state with non - abelian quasi - particle braiding statistics.@xcite to date , there is no physical system that has been conclusively demonstrated to have this property .",
    "certain fractional quantum hall states , most notably @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are believed to be exceptionally promising candidates for possessing non - abelian quasi - particles and their experimental verification would constitute a major milestone in physics .",
    "the evidence that the @xmath4 quantum hall state is non - abelian comes from a combination of analytical theory ; @xcite numerical study of small systems ; @xcite and , most importantly , experiment itself.@xcite in the case of the @xmath5 state , @xcite conjectures of non - abelian - ness are based solely on numerics.@xcite    non - abelian quantum hall states were first constructed with the use of conformal field theory ( cft).@xcite moore and read@xcite argued that candidate wavefunctions could be computed as certain correlation functions ( conformal blocks ) of a cft . by requiring that the wavefunctions have certain physical properties , the set of allowed cfts turn out to be highly constrained .",
    "the simplest cft that satisfies the constraints and possess non - abelian quasi - particles is the @xmath6 ising cft which leads to a wavefunction known as the moore - read ( mr ) ",
    "pfaffian \" state , so named because the wavefunction contains a pfaffian factor .",
    "numerics @xcite supports this wavefunction as a candidate description of the @xmath4 plateau,@xcite which has the largest gap among observed plateaus in the second landau level.@xcite    the hypothesis that the @xmath4 state is non - abelian has , until recently , been based on the moore - read ( mr ) wavefunction @xcite and quasiparticle excitations above it.@xcite however , it was recently realized that there is an alternate non - abelian candidate for @xmath4 , the _ anti - pfaffian _ state @xcite which , in the limit of vanishing landau - level mixing , is exactly degenerate in energy with the mr pfaffian state ( although both might , in principle , be higher in energy than some other state ) .",
    "exact diagonalization studies have generally neglected landau - level mixing and have , therefore , not distinguished between these two states .",
    "early numerics on the sphere @xcite failed to look to for the anti - pfaffian state , which occurs at a different shift . on the torus , @xcite finite - size effects , which cause mixing between these two states and a consequent energy splitting , were too large .",
    "however , more recent numerics on the sphere @xcite and the torus @xcite make it clear that , in the absence of landau - level mixing , the anti - pfaffian state is as good a candidate as the mr pfaffian state with a ground state energy which converges with that of the mr pfaffian in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "recent work on the effects of landau - level mixing indicate that the anti - pfaffian state is , in fact , lower in energy for realistic values of the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite however , it is difficult to experimentally distinguish the anti - pfaffian state from the mr pfaffian state .",
    "the smallest quasiparticle charge is @xmath7 in both states , so shot noise measurements @xcite can not distinguish between them .",
    "the two states non - abelian braiding properties are very similar .",
    "thus , interferometry experiments , @xcite such as those of willett et al .",
    "@xcite are also unlikely to distinguish between these two states .",
    "it is possible , in principle , to distinguish them by their @xmath8 curves , but these can be modified by edge reconstruction , so the distinction between the @xmath8 curves of the two states might be blurred .",
    "the two states can also be distinguished by the signs of their thermal hall conductances , but only if the larger contribution of the filled lowest landau level ( of both spins ) can be separated .",
    "therefore , there is a need for experiments capable of distinguishing these two candidate descriptions of the @xmath4 state . in this paper , we show how differences in the gapless edge modes of the anti - pfaffian and mr pfaffian states lead to different quantum impurity ( resonant level ) models and transport properties when these states are coupled to quantum dots.@xcite we also briefly discuss the expectations for other ( numerically less competitive ) quantum hall states at @xmath4 , such as the su(2)@xmath9 naf,@xcite @xmath10 strong pairing,@xcite and ( 3,3,1 ) state.@xcite    the mr pfaffian state was generalized by read and rezayi @xcite ( rr ) , who constructed wavefunctions using the @xmath11 parafermion cfts ( the case @xmath3 is the mr pfaffian wavefunction ) . these wavefunctions are candidate states for filling fraction @xmath1 and they all posses non - abelian quasi - particle braiding statistics for @xmath12 .",
    "the particle - hole conjugates of the rr states , which we will call the ` anti - rr states ' , were constructed recently ; @xcite the @xmath13 anti - rr state is a candidate description of the @xmath5 plateau .",
    "another class of non - abelian candidate states follow from bonderson and slingerland s @xcite ( bs ) hierarchy construction built on the @xmath4 state . at @xmath5 , the @xmath13 anti - rr state and one of the bs states are distinct non - abelian candidates .",

    "since the non - fermi liquid physics of multi - channel kondo models with channel isotropy is usually unstable to small anisotropies in the coupling to different channels , this physics is very difficult to realize in experiment .",
    "a central result of this work is that the non - abelian nature of the rr fractional quantum hall states _ automatically _ provides channel isotropy in the emergent multi - channel kondo model . in this sense",
    ", the non - abelian fractional quantum hall state provides  topological protection \" to the non - fermi liquid physics of the multi - channel kondo model . in this way",
    ", we have uncovered a scenario in which a global property , the topological order of the rr states , protects fragile _ local _ quantum impurity physics .",
    "our analysis is based on properties of the gapless edge excitations required by the topological order of the rr states .",
    "we also consider the situation in which two bulk quantum hall droplets are separated by a quantum dot ( i.e. another bulk droplet on the right side of the dot in fig.[fig : schematic ] , as shown in fig.[fig : transport ] ) .",
    "this setup is relevant to a two point - contact interferometer @xcite when the backscattering at each point contact is large , so that it is in the coulomb blockade regime.@xcite one may naively think that this scenario would  double \" the number of  conduction \" electron channels and lead to a @xmath17-channel kondo model .",

    "qualitatively , the situation is similar in an abelian fractional quantum hall state : the bulk is gapped and the edge contains an integer number of chiral gapless edge modes .",
    "however , due to the central role that interactions play in the fractional quantum hall effect , these edge modes carry charges which are a fraction of the electron charge .",
    "the simplest example is the laughlin state at filling fraction @xmath32 , with @xmath33 an odd integer .",
    "a laughlin state contains a single edge mode .",
    "wen demonstrated@xcite that the universal properties of this edge mode are described by a chiral luttinger liquid theory ( a guassian cft ) with edge mode charges and correlations determined by @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is a special case of this theory ) .",

    "( depending on the non - universal matrix @xmath52 , the symmetric basis or , perhaps , another basis may be the eigenmodes of the hamiltonian . )",
    "the edge theories of non - abelian fractional quantum hall states always contain additional electrically neutral modes that carry no charge but do carry heat .",
    "these neutral modes are responsible for the non - abelian properties of the quantum hall state . in the class of quantum hall states we consider in this paper",
    ", the neutral modes will correspond to either majorana fermions , or their generalization , parafermions ( to be described below ) .",
    "second , disorder at the edge plays an important role for fractional quantum hall states with counter - propagating edge modes.@xcite if all the charged modes are propagating in the same direction , disorder has no effect at the boundary because edge modes have no states into which they can backscatter . forward",
    "scattering is unimportant as it has no qualitative effect on the physics . on the other hand , if the edge contains counter - propagating modes it is possible for backscattering to occur in the presence of disorder .",
    "as is well known , backscattering in one - dimensional interacting systems can lead to dramatic effects.@xcite one can then analyze the disorder terms within a renormalization group approach .",
    "a new effective edge theory can emerge at low energies when disorder is relevant.@xcite whether a given state in the hierarchy has counter - propagating modes can be determined simply by looking at the sign of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath77 appearing in eq .. if there are eigenvalues of opposite sign , there are counter - propagating modes .",
    "this situation occurs at filling fraction @xmath78 for which @xmath79 and @xmath80 , for example.@xcite as a rule of thumb , particle - hole conjugate states contain counter - propagating edge modes and one needs to consider the effect of edge disorder .",
    "( the @xmath78 state can be thought of as @xmath81 fluid of holes in a @xmath35 background .",
    "thus , the edge theory in the absence of disorder can be described by an  outer \" @xmath35 edge and an  inner \" @xmath82 counter propagating edge . )",
    "the same scenario will arise in particle - hole conjugate states in non - abelian quantum hall systems .",
    "one must analyze the relevance of disorder there as well and determine the new effective low - energy theory of the edge if disorder is relevant.@xcite      fermi statistics requires that a large class of abelian states have odd - denominator filling fractions , such as the most prominently observed ones , which have @xmath83 .",
    "@xcite it thus came as a surprise when a hall plateau at filling fraction @xmath4 was observed.@xcite fractional quantum hall states with even - denominator filling fractions were proposed , based on the idea that electrons could form bosonic pairs which could then condense into a bosonic analogue of the laughlin state.@xcite such states could be either abelian @xcite or non - abelian.@xcite ( it was later realized that one proposed state @xcite was actually critical.@xcite ) these states are distinguished by the topological properties of their pair wavefunctions .",

    "for @xmath388 , @xmath389 , this is just a cumbersome way of writing the @xmath383-channel kondo hamltonian .",

    "conversely , we could bring the @xmath393 term into two - channel kondo form , at the cost of making the @xmath393 term , at the cost of making the @xmath391 term complicated . in the case of more general rr states ,",
    "the same situation is appears : we have representations in which the coupling to either bulk state of these terms is simple and of @xmath0-channel kondo form , but we do nt have a representation in which both couplings are simple and tractable .",

    "the low temperature physics can exhibit some interesting crossovers .",
    "suppose that @xmath395 , but both are still small ( compared to the charging energy of the dot and all other microscopic scales ) .",
    "then it makes sense to perform the unitary transformation ( [ eqn : transport - unitary ] ) in order to bring the hamiltonian to the form ( [ eqn : asymmetric - transport ] ) . in this form",
    ", @xmath391 is relevant and flows to the @xmath18-channel kondo fixed point , while @xmath393 is irrelevant and flows to zero .",
    "the most salient feature in this limit will be that the dot does not , as the temperature is lowered , decouple from both bulk qh states but , instead , from only one of them .",
    "consequently , coulomb blockade peaks , rather than narrowing as the temperature is lowered , may broaden instead since there will not be a completely isolated dot at @xmath396 .",
    "the intermediate coupling fixed points which we found in this paper may seem somewhat mysterious , so we suggest a physical picture which may help explain them . in order to do so ,",
    "we draw on the ideas of ref . [ ] , in which it was shown that quantum hall edge states and their interaction with bulk quasiparticles could be understood in terms of boundary conformal field theory as follows . if the boundary of a quantum hall droplet is treated as a 1-d system by `",
    "squashing ' the edge down and temporarily ignoring the 2-d bulk , then the 1-d system lives on an interval and , therefore , has conformally - invariant boundary conditions at the two ends of the interval ( since there was clearly no length scale introduced in the process of reduction to a 1-d system ) .",
    "( here , ` droplet ' refers to the bulk quantum hall state , not the ` dot ' . )",
    "different possible conformally - invariant boundary conditions correspond to different possible quasiparticles in the 2-d bulk , which is one way in which the system evinces , through bulk - edge interaction , the fact that it is not really 1-d . in abelian states , this is relatively trivial and can usually be ignored , but in non - abelian states , this effect can be significant .",
    "in particular , different possible conformally - invariant boundary conditions have different boundary entropies , which are given by the quantum dimensions of the associated bulk quasiparticles .",
    "returning now to our new fixed points , we note that the ground state entropy change associated with our new fixed points is precisely equal to the entropy drop expected if the two - fold degeneracy of the dot is lifted and the boundary entropy of the edge excitations of the droplet _ increases _ by @xmath397 , where @xmath398 is the quantum dimension of the minimal charge quasiparticle .",
    "( here , we refer to the boundary entropy at the point at which tunneling to the dot occurs when the edge is ` squashed ' to a 1-d interval . )",
    "we emphasize that the change in boundary entropy is measured via a change in boundary conditions of the _ droplet_/bulk quantum hall state edge that provides the electrons tunneling to the dot , and so is _ independent of the details _ of the electronic structure on the dot .",
    "this suggests the following picture for our fixed point , which relies on the fact that the fixed point occurs at intermediate dot - bulk edge coupling so that the charge on the dot fluctuates and is not necessarily integral .",
    "( again , we note this is true independent of the electronic structure of the dot , provided that it is a degenerate two - level system in the absence of tunneling . in particular",
    ", it does not matter whether it is in a quantum hall state or not . )",
    "thus , we can imagine that a quasiparticle - quasihole pair is nucleated so that the quasiparticle is on the droplet and the quasihole is on the dot ( or vice versa ) .",
    "this is true , even though at ",
    "high energies \" it is electrons that are tunneling , not quasi - particles .",
    "the presence of the quasiparticle on the droplet changes the boundary entropy by according to the arguments of ref .",
    "the presence of the quasihole on the dot lifts the degeneracy between the @xmath16 and @xmath399-electron states , thereby changing the boundary entropy by @xmath400 . to see this , consider , for the sake of concreteness , a pfaffian state .",
    "the energy on a small pfaffian dot can be modeled by @xmath401 where @xmath402 corresponds to @xmath16 or @xmath399 electrons , @xmath403 is the length of the edge , and @xmath404 is the coulomb charging energy .",
    "the first term is the coulomb energy , with an offset @xmath405 while the second term is the energy in the neutral sector ( associated with creating a majorana fermion when an electron is added ) . by tuning @xmath406",
    ", we can make the @xmath16 and @xmath399 electron states degenerate in energy .",
    "however , when a charge @xmath7 quasiparticle is added to the dot , the neutral energy vanishes due to the existence of a dot edge zero mode .",
    "consequently , the degeneracy is lifted .",
    "the total entropy drop is thus @xmath407 , as predicted for the multi - channel kondo model.@xcite    we should emphasize that the precise nature of the electronic states on the quantum dot are not important for our basic result of multi - channel kondo physics in the electron tunneling on and off the dot .",
    "in particular , if there is coupling between the edge of the dot and the bulk of the dot , the physics will remain unchanged provided that the energy of other states ( not involved in the 2-fold level degeneracy ) is more than the tunnel broadening and @xmath408 away in energy . in this case , the level ",
    "d \" will correspond to some hybridization of edge and bulk states .",
    "in fact , the fractional quantum hall state in the partially filled landau level in the dot can even be destroyed by finite size effects ( from being too small for example ) and it would not affect our conclusions , provided again that the nearby level spacing is larger than tunnel broadening and temperature . however , there is one detail that is important to our result , and that is that the completely filled lower landau levels pass freely under the point contact .",
    "this detail is important because it means that the tunneling from the bulk quantum hall edge to the quantum dot only occurs from the  read - rezayi \" part and not the filled lower landau levels .",
    "if the two integer quantum hall edges are also backscattered at the point contact , they should also be included in the edge electron tunneling operators ( note the plural ! ) to the quantum dot .",
    "these additional electron tunneling processes will drive the system towards the single - channel kondo model at all filling fractions since the  channel isotropy \" coming from the parafermion part of the electron operator will no longer protect the multi - channel kondo physics when these additional channels are present . in effect , we expect the physics to be similar to the case of the anti - pfaffian where the edge electron operator is not unique and the system is described by the single - channel kondo model at the lowest energies",
    ".    there are at least two other scenarios ( of which we are aware ) where 2-channel kondo physics emerges in the context of quantum hall states : fradkin and sandler discuss a junction of a @xmath81 fractional quantum hall state and a normal metal.@xcite fendley , _ et al . _ discuss the iv characteristics of a point contact in a pfaffian state and show that the crossover from weak to strong backscattering of charge @xmath7 quasiparticles is described by a variant of the 2-channel kondo model.@xcite in both cases , the physics is quite distinct from what we discuss in this work .",
    "we are unaware of any other works considering multi - channel kondo models derived from the general read - rezayi states , or other candidate non - abelian fractional quantum hall states .    in order to see multi - channel kondo physics in our setup for the mr state , we need @xmath409 .",
    "the following is a very crude estimate of the relevant parameters .",
    "we take @xmath410 m/s ( although smaller values are possible if the edge confining potential is smoother ) , which implies @xmath411 .",
    "the coupling @xmath278 is the coulomb energy for an electron on the dot and charge per unit length @xmath412 on the edge in the vicinity of @xmath245 .",
    "if @xmath160 is the distance between the dot and the bulk state , and the magnetic length @xmath413 is the short - distance cutoff for edge physics , then we have @xmath414 . for @xmath415 , @xmath416",
    "thus , @xmath278 and @xmath91 are comparable , and by tuning the edge velocity or the bulk - dot distance , it should be possible to arrange @xmath409 .",
    "we emphasize that this estimate is extremely crude because it is difficult to accurately estimate the strength of the interaction @xmath278 as it depends on non - universal details of the edge , including screening effects from the gates and possibly the edge modes themselves . at any rate , by the same logic",
    ", it should be possible to make the exponent @xmath417 which appears in the kondo temperature , @xmath327 , of order @xmath418 .",
    "if , for instance , it is precisely equal to @xmath418 , we will have @xmath419 . in edge tunneling experiments ,",
    "@xmath277 values are often in the range @xmath420 , so we expect that the multi - channel kondo fixed point will be observable for accessible temperatures .",
    "a complicating issue in real experiments is possible edge reconstruction , which is expected if the edges are sufficiently smooth.@xcite when edge reconstruction occurs , pairs of counter - propagating edge modes appear that do not affect the hall conductance , but do affect the edge hamiltonian .",
    "the presence of these modes could in principle destabilize the multi - channel kondo physics we have discussed here at the lowest energies , but one generally expects their coupling to the dot to be much weaker due to their greater spatial separation from it . in that case , it may be that even if edge reconstruction is present it will not have much effect over a fairly large range of temperatures and the multi - channel kondo physics will still be observable .",
    "finally , while the observation of non - fermi liquid physics in the thermodynamics of the dot would provide strong evidence for a non - abelian state of moore - read or read - rezayi type ( at the appropriate filling fraction ) , the converse is not true : lack of non - fermi liquid properties could result from the presence of a particle - hole conjugate state , strong edge reconstruction , or even an abelian quantum hall state .",
    "thus , if fermi liquid properties are observed , further studies must be done to determine if the state is non - abelian .",
    "in summary , we have shown that a quantum dot coupled via tunneling to a pfaffian quantum hall state realizes the channel symmetric @xmath18-channel kondo model while a quantum dot coupled to a read - rezayi state of filling factor @xmath1 leads to a channel symmetric @xmath0-channel kondo problem , both without any fine tuning of parameters .",
    "these systems will thus exhibit all the known non - fermi liquid properties in their thermodynamics , expressed through the charge on the dot , which may be measured capacitively . because the coupling of a quantum dot to an anti - pfaffian state generically exhibits fermi liquid properties ,",
    "our results may be used to distinguish between the two leading candidate states for @xmath4 : the pfaffian and the anti - pfaffian .",
    "our central results can be understood within the context of the emery - kivelson ( ek ) solution to the 2-channel kondo model . in the ek analysis ,",
    "a 2-channel kondo model is mapped to a resonant level coupled to some gapless degrees of freedom . in the channel symmetric case ,",
    "the gapless mode is a majorana fermion and non - fermi liquid impurity physics results .",
    "thus , 2-channel kondo physics is governed by a majorana resonant level . in the case of channel asymmetry",
    ", the level effectively couples to a dirac fermion and fermi liquid impurity physics is found , characteristic of the 1-channel kondo model .    in our work , we reverse the process and ask  to what quantum impurity model does a resonant level coupled to a rr state correspond ? \" . for @xmath3 the rr state is the mr pfaffian state , which has a _ single _ majorana mode on its edge .",

    "is replaced by a @xmath11 parafermion ( which is a majorana for @xmath3 ) which takes the place of the majorana in the @xmath0-channel kondo model .",

    "<S> we assume the dot is small enough that its level spacing is large compared to both the temperature and the coupling to the spatially proximate bulk non - abelian fractional quantum hall state . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the physics of level degeneracy with electron number on the dot . </S>",
    "<S> the physics of such a resonant level is governed by a @xmath0-channel kondo model when the quantum hall state is a read - rezayi state at filling fraction @xmath1 or its particle - hole conjugate at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-channel kondo model is channel symmetric even without fine tuning any couplings in the former state ; in the latter , it is generically channel asymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> the two limits exhibit non - fermi liquid and fermi liquid properties , respectively , and therefore may be distinguished . by exploiting the mapping between the resonant level model and the multichannel kondo model , we discuss the thermodynamic and transport properties of the system . in the special case of @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a novel venue to distinguish between the pfaffian and anti - pfaffian states at filling fraction @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we present numerical estimates for realizing this scenario in experiment . </S>"
