    "the one - parameter scaling theory of abrahams et  al .",
    "@xcite predicts that all single - particle electronic states of non - interacting electronic systems in two dimensions ( 2d ) are localized for arbitrarily weak random potential has attracted much attention in the last 25 years .",
    "this subtle effect is understood as being due to the constructive interference between time - reversed paths which increases the probability of returning to the original position leading to universal conductance fluctuations  @xcite and corrections to conductivity , whose divergence in @xmath3 explains the absence of diffusion  @xcite .",
    "it has also been investigated numerically for different lattice structures , e.g. , square , honeycomb and triangular at the band center ( @xmath4 ) and away from the band center in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems , but no extended states were found for the non - interacting and zero - field case , supporting the scaling hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "there have been more theoretical and experimental investigations to see the validity of the conclusions of scaling theory  @xcite , supporting the theory from a variety of numerical , experimental and analytical approaches in the absence of electron - electron interactions , magnetic field and spin - orbit interactions @xcite .    in 3d systems on the other hand , scaling theory predicts that there exists a second - order continuous phase transition , with a critical disorder above which all the states are localized whereas below it extended states appear at the band center , separated by mobility edges from the localized states in the rest of the spectrum .",
    "this was supported by numerical  @xcite and analytical investigations @xcite , with @xmath3 being the lower critical dimension of the transition .",
    "the question then can be posed what happens in thin films of finite thickness .",
    "when such a small thickness in terms of a few layers is introduced in an infinite 2d electron system , the degree of freedom of the electron motion will be increased .",
    "this thin film can be expected to behave as a 2d system , if the thouless length @xmath5 , which is the length scale up to which an electron can diffuse without inelastic collisions , is larger than the film thickness @xmath0 , whereas for usual thin films , @xmath6  [ ] .",
    "the study of such systems should be important because experiments are always done in thin films of finite thickness , and some experiments @xcite which studied electron transport with the variation of film thickness showed a fascinating role of the film thickness in the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) : the authors observed an mit in mo - c films at a certain thickness and found that the characteristic parameters like localization length and dielectric constant grow exponentially with increasing thickness near the transition .",
    "the numerical investigations in 2d and 3d systems played an important role to study the properties of electronic eigenstates in these systems .",
    "there have been various numerical methods applied in these systems , e.g.  using exact diagonalization of the secular matrices  @xcite , energy - level statistics  @xcite , transfer - matrix method ( tmm ) @xcite , studies of the dimensionless conductance @xcite , etc .",
    "the results of these studies support the one - parameter scaling hypothesis .",
    "recently  @xcite , there was a discrepancy between numerical results obtained using the tmm and an analytical analysis of thin films of finite thickness based on the self - consistent theory  @xcite .",
    "numerically , an mit induced by film thickness was found whereas the analytical results showed no metallic phase if the thickness of the film is finite  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy is rather surprising since previous studies of 2d systems  @xcite showed good agreement between the analytical and numerical results .    with this motivation",
    "we address numerically the problem of localization in thin disordered systems of noninteracting electrons using the standard tmm and finite size scaling ( fss )  @xcite for non - interacting electrons in zero magnetic field as described by the anderson model of localization ( defined below ) , in systems of considerably larger sizes than in  ref .",
    "[ ] and compare it with the analytical results . to this end",
    "we first note that the analytical expression for the localization length @xmath7 from  [ ] can be expressed as @xmath8 where @xmath9 are non - universal constants , @xmath1 is the disorder strength and @xmath10 is the film thickness .",
    "the expression is valid for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the fermi wavelength , @xmath14 the elastic mean - free path , and @xmath15 is the system size . in infinitely thick films ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "on the other hand , a crossover from 2d to 3d takes place where one can get both a metallic and an insulating phase depending on the disorder strength .    in section",
    "ii , we describe the model and the notations ; the tmm and fss are discussed in section iii ; obtained numerical results are presented in section iv and some conclusions based on our numerical results drawn in section v.",
    "the hamiltonian we have used for our numerical calculations is the anderson model of localization given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a tight - binding state at site @xmath19 .",
    "the sites @xmath19 form a simple cubic lattice with @xmath20 atoms where @xmath15 is the length , @xmath21 is the width , and @xmath0 is the thickness of the lattice , here measured in the number of layers of the system , in units of the distance @xmath22 between the layers . since the only relevant microscopic scale in the continuum model that gives eq .",
    "( [ eq : bro ] ) is @xmath14 , we compare the length scales of the continuum and anderson model _ via _ the relation @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a non - universal number which needs to be taken into account when comparing analytical and numerical results .",
    "we use open boundary conditions along the @xmath0 ( thickness ) direction and periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath21 ( width ) direction .",
    "the on - site potentials @xmath25 are taken to be randomly distributed in the interval @xmath26 $ ] ; @xmath27 denotes that the hopping @xmath28 is restricted to the nearest neighbors and the energy units are chosen by setting @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that this model describes the thin layered system if @xmath30 .",
    "when @xmath0 becomes comparable to @xmath21 at small @xmath1 , one should expect a crossover from insulating towards metallic behavior after fss , and it is therefore important to have @xmath31 as small as possible in order to stay in the limit of finite thickness .",
    "we therefore attribute the appearance of the metallic - like behavior in the numerical simulations of ref .  [ ] to the large values of @xmath31 used .",
    "indeed , for @xmath32 , for instance , as @xmath21 was changed from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , the cross - section of the bars changed from rectangular to square to rectangular shape , and the scaling analysis for such geometries should not be compared with the analytical results of  [ ] .",
    "instead , we focus on systems ( [ h ] ) with @xmath35 . in the case of the thickest system",
    "studied here , for example , the scaling analysis is done for @xmath32 and @xmath36 as we discuss in detail below .",
    "in the tmm one determines localization properties by a scaling analysis of the lyapunov exponents ( le ) of the transfer matrices of quasi-1d bars .",
    "the largest length scale @xmath37 is obtained from the smallest le , @xmath38 .",
    "the accuracy of these @xmath37 is determined from the variance of the changes of the exponents in the course of the iteration , and the relative error of @xmath39 is 1% in our calculations . for @xmath40",
    "our system is a 2d strip of width @xmath21 and length @xmath41 , while for @xmath42 , it becomes a 3d bar with square cross - section of @xmath43 atoms and length @xmath15 .",
    "we check the one - parameter scaling theory by the fss analysis  @xcite of the renormalized decay length , @xmath44 , for each @xmath0 individually by expressing it as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the scaling parameter which can be identified as the localization length in the insulating regime and the resistivity in the metallic regime of the infinite system  @xcite and @xmath47 should be , if the one - parameter hypothesis holds , a universal function @xmath48 independent of @xmath0 . the scale of @xmath7 is determined from the condition that @xmath49 when @xmath50  [ ] , which corresponds to expressing @xmath7 in units of @xmath22 .",
    "the numerical determination of @xmath47 is done by the method based on ref .",
    "[ ] , and the thus obtained scaling functions for different @xmath0 are compared to check for the universality . if there is an mit , then @xmath51 for given @xmath0 will have two branches , one which goes to zero as @xmath21 increases ( indicating localization of electronic eigenstates ) and the other which diverges as @xmath21 increases ( indicating extended eigenstates ) .             fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] shows @xmath52 as a function of strip width @xmath21 for various @xmath1 , the scaling function @xmath53 , as well as the localization length @xmath54 for systems with @xmath55 layers , and fig .",
    "[ fig : rem ] shows the same quantities for systems with @xmath56 layers .",

    ", @xmath57 decreases as the width of the system @xmath21 increases indicating localization , while for smaller @xmath1 values the decrease becomes much weaker .",
    "in addition to the results presented in figs .  [",
    "fig : all ] and [ fig : rem ] , we have calculated @xmath58 for @xmath1 values as small as @xmath59 for @xmath60 , respectively , but no metallic behavior was found . instead ,",
    "@xmath61 become approximately constant for smaller @xmath1 values , which is in qualitative agreement with 2d being the lower critical dimension of the localization - delocalization transition .",
    "for @xmath62 from figs .",
    "[ fig : all ] and [ fig : rem].,width=288 ]    to see the dependence of the scaling function @xmath63 on @xmath0 , we first plot all the obtained results for @xmath63 in figs .",

    "[ fig : f ] , without any rescaling or shifting of individual curves , including the curve for @xmath40 .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath63 does not depend on @xmath0 , therefore supporting the universality of the scaling function @xmath48 . since it has only one branch corresponding to the localized states it is also in agreement with the one - parameter scaling hypothesis for disorder strengths @xmath64 for @xmath60 , respectively . for @xmath40 , one parameter - scaling",
    "was found  @xcite to hold for @xmath65 , and the previously obtained  @xcite scaling function @xmath48 for 2d system agrees within error bars with the @xmath48 obtained here for @xmath66 , furthermore supporting the universality of the result .    to compare the dependence of the localization lengths on @xmath1 to the analytical result  ( [ eq : bro ] ) , we fit the obtained @xmath46 to the form @xmath67 as shown in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : xi ] .",
    "the upper and lower right panels of the same figure show , respectively , the dependence of @xmath68 and @xmath69 on the number of layers @xmath0 .",
    "the upper right panel of the figure also contains the mean least - squares linear fit of @xmath68 , which gives @xmath70 .",
    "the obtained value @xmath71 is an additional check that the numerical results are in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : bro ] ) as far as the @xmath72 dependence in the exponent is concerned .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath73 depend on @xmath0 , which seems to be in contradiction with eq .",
    "( [ eq : bro ] ) but can be explained by taking into the account the scale factor @xmath74 , and fig .",
    "[ fig : lnf - renorm ] shows @xmath73 , where @xmath75 for @xmath76 , when @xmath77 becomes approximately constant , and @xmath78 , where the error bar is estimated from the range of @xmath74 values for which the values of @xmath77 for different @xmath0 remain within error bars among themselves .",
    "this result can be interpreted as that the effective @xmath14 of the lattice model  ( [ eq : anderson ] ) in the range of @xmath1 studied is of the order of @xmath79 lattice constants .",
