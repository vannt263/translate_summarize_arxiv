    "there has been a strong revival of interest , recently , in the physics of magnetic vortices in type ii and high - temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "the motion of these vortices subsequent to the applied supercurrent gives rise to a non - zero resistance , especially important in the case of the high-@xmath0 materials .",
    "most research efforts have been devoted to phenomena relating to the nature of the mixed phase of a superconductor in some externally applied magnetic field and supercurrent .",
    "issues connected with the pinning of the flux lines by defects have been widely studied .",
    "we @xcite , as well as ao and thouless @xcite and stephen @xcite , have addressed the problem of the quantum dynamics of vortices in the absence of an external field but in the presence of an externally driven supercurrent , quantum dissipation and pinning .",
    "this leads to the decay of a supercurrent , or a residual low - temperature resistance in the superconductor . whilst most of the dissipation seems to be ascribed to vortices tunneling in the sample from the edge @xcite , another interesting and novel possibility also explored by us in depth",
    "is that of a residual resistance arising from spontaneous vortex - antivortex pair creation in the bulk of , for example , a superconducting thin film .",
    "we have set up a powerful theory to study both bulk nucleation and tunneling from the edge of vortices spontaneously created either by the quantum fluctuations of the magnus force field or by the current s gradient at the border of the sample .",
    "we find that , due to the high values of the critical currents in thin films , these dissipative effects can become particularly important in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) geometry , where lateral fluctuations of the flux lines can be neglected .    in this report",
    "we discuss our findings , comparing the rates of edge tunneling and bulk nucleation , to find that both effects can become important and observable under suitable conditions . our theory is set up to study vortex tunneling and nucleation in the 2d geometry in the presence of quantum dissipation and of pinning potentials .",
    "the central result is that the tunneling / nucleation rate @xmath1 has a strong exponential dependence on the number current density @xmath2    @xmath3    here @xmath4 is an effective viscosity coefficient as renormalised by the magnetic - like part of the magnus force , and @xmath5 is the barrier or nucleation energy for a single vortex as renormalized by screened coulomb interactions and ( fake ) landau - level corrections .",
    "this exponential dependence would make the tunneling / nucleation ( folded , e.g. , into the sample s resistance ) observable in a rather narrow range of @xmath2-values .",
    "thus , normally the superconductor is practically resistance - free .",
    "however , the high values of @xmath2 that can be reached in the high-@xmath0 materials make the possibility of observing both tunneling and pair creation within reach for thin films",
    ". one particular feature that would uniquely relate the residual resistance to the phenomenon of spontaneous vortex - pair creation is the presence of _ oscillations _ in the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath6 in case a _ periodic _ pinning potential is artificially created in the film .",
    "these oscillations are in fact strictly connected to the pinning - lattice spacing @xmath7 of the periodic potential ( we assume a square lattice ) , e.g.    @xmath8 \\label{potent}\\ ] ]    acting on the nucleating vortex - pairs described by a coordinate @xmath9 .",
    "the problem of quantum dissipation for a particle ( the 2d vortex ) moving in a periodic potential has some interesting features in its own right @xcite .",
    "it is characterised by a localization phase transition driven by dissipation ; accordingly , two phases can occur depending on whether the dissipation coefficient @xcite @xmath10 is greater ( confined phase ) or smaller ( mobile phase ) than a critical value @xmath11 .",
    "this localization transition is described by a kosterlitz - type renormalization group ( rg ) approach .",
    "we have implemented the rg approach for the evaluation of the dependence of the spontaneous nucleation rate of vortex - antivortex pairs on the external parameters for our own quantum dynamical system .",
    "a remnant of the dissipation - driven phase transition is observed and the pair production rate @xmath1 can be derived in both phases by means of a frequency - space rg procedure leading to observable current - oscillations if @xmath12 . these result from a correction factor @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ rategen ] ) which is sensitive to the periodicity @xmath14 of the pinning substate .",
    "by measuring these oscillations one can confirm the spontaneous pair - creation related nature of the residual resistance in a superconducting thin film , as well as microscopically or even mesoscopically probe the lattice structure of the pinning substrate .",
    "below , we give a summary of our theoretical treatment and discuss the results obtained for the various cases relevant to supercurrent decay .",
    "details of our work can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "one can show that a vortex moving in a superfluid experiences a force , the magnus force , which is the equivalent of the electromagnetic coulomb - lorentz force .",
    "the classical equation of motion reads :    @xmath15    with @xmath16 the ( negligible ) inertial mass of the vortex , carrying topological charge @xmath17 , treated as a single , point - like particle of 2d coordinate @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the phenomenological potential acting on the vortex and @xmath10 is a phenomenological friction coefficient taking dissipation into account .",
    "a supercurrent @xmath20 gives rise to an electric - like field @xmath21 ( a notation implying @xmath22 ) superposed to a magnetic - like field @xmath23 for a thin film orthogonal to the vector @xmath24 and having thickness @xmath14 with a superfluid component characterised by a 3d number density @xmath25 .",
    "the quantum - mechanical counterpart of eq .",
    "( [ classic ] ) is constructed through the feynman path - integral transposition in which the dissipation is treated quantistically through the formulation due to caldeira and leggett @xcite .",
    "this approach views quantum dissipation as described by the linear coupling of the vortex coordinate to the coordinates of a bath of harmonic oscillators of prescribed dynamics .",
    "quite generally , we deal with the quantum decay of the `` vacuum '' , represented by a static e.m .- like magnus field , through its quantum fluctuations : in this case the vortex - antivortex pairs .",
    "the decay rate @xmath1 is given by the formula ( @xmath26 is a normalization factor )    @xmath27    where @xmath28 , with @xmath29 here , is the volume of the sample , and the euclidean single - particle lagrangian for closed trajectories in space - time is    @xmath30    here , the set @xmath31 represents the caldeira - leggett bath of harmonic oscillators simulating quantum friction , with @xmath32 ( @xmath33 being some frequency cutoff ) fixing the spectral distribution of frequencies ( we restrict the present discussion to the ohmic case ) . also , @xmath34 is the uniform magnus field tensor and @xmath35 is the relativistic counterpart of the classical potential , eq .",
    "( [ potent ] ) , thus having amplitude @xmath36 ( we have assumed @xmath37 ) .",
    "@xmath38 is the vortex nucleation energy .",
    "as one important remark , we assume here that the microscopic dissipation mechanism due to the normal material inside the vortex core , whether phonon- or electron - driven , can be always described phenomenologically by the caldeira - leggett type action .    the feynman path integral in eq .",
    "( [ rerate ] ) can now be evaluated at the leading singularity of the @xmath39-integral ; in the dissipation - dominated regime ( @xmath40 ) we obtain the exact analytic expression for the bulk nucleation rate :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are renormalizations due to the magnetic - like field .",
    "further renormalizations of @xmath38 due to vortex - vortex interactions are understood . according to this formula , for small current densities @xmath2 the nucleation rate ,",
    "hence the resistance @xcite , is negligible .",
    "however , depending on the material parameters , for higher @xmath2 both the rate @xmath44 and the film resistance can become important . before discussing realistic estimates",
    ", we consider the startling effect of a periodic pinning potential on bulk nucleation .",
    "suppose a regular lattice of pinning sites is introduced artificially in the sample , e.g. in a square - lattice configuration .",
    "this can be achieved by means of a variety of etching or laser ablation or other techniques combined with modern mbe - type sample growth processes .",
    "we are then confronted with the motion ( and then the quantum - mechanical nucleation ) of particles in a dissipative and periodic - potential situation .",
    "this type of quantum diffusion has been studied at length @xcite . in the mobile phase ,",
    "the rg analysis predicts a vanishing large - scale potential amplitude , thus no significant effect of the pinning potential can be expected on the nucleation rate , except for a further renormalization of @xmath38 .",
    "we look therefore for a situation corresponding to the confined phase ( @xmath12 ) where the effective pinning potential amplitude grows up to an upper limit as nucleation proceedes in the bulk of the film @xcite .    when the rg analysis is folded into the evaluation of the leading contribution to the feynman path integral in eq .",
    "( [ rerate ] ) for the periodic pinning potential ( [ potent ] ) , we end up with the following analytic result for the nucleation rate :    @xmath45    here @xmath44 is given by eq .",
    "( [ rate0 ] ) , there is the further renormalization @xmath46 for the nucleation energy , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are bessel functions and the renormalised amplitude @xmath49 is a few times @xmath50 itself @xcite .",
    "@xmath51 is a nucleation length , given in the lowest approximation by @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 is a dimensionless parameter of order unity .",
    "we then see that the competition between the nucleation length @xmath51 and the pinning - lattice spacing @xmath54 leads to oscillations , as the current @xmath2 is changed , in the nucleation rate ( hence in the resistance ) .",
    "this shows that in the nucleation process the dissociating vortex - antivortex pairs `` feel '' the periodicity of the pinning substrate .",
    "now for the estimates of the expected values of @xmath1 .",
    "so far , the computation referred to @xmath55 .",
    "in @xcite we proposed to take into account finite temperatures by adding incoherently , in the above formulas , a term proportional to @xmath56 ( note @xmath57 ) : @xmath58 , such that for @xmath59 the standard boltzmann exponential form in the vortex density , @xmath60 , is recovered in the absence of pinning .",
    "this might be a reasonable qualitative treatment of thermal effects for temperatures less than @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , we propose , following minnhagen @xcite , to account for vortex - antivortex coulomb - like interactions by means of a current - dependent ( and temperature- independent ) activation energy : @xmath62 , with @xmath63 including all other renormalization effects .",
    "this expression entails an @xmath5 infinite for @xmath64 ( as is appropriate below the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition in the film ) and changing sign , thus becoming unphysical , at @xmath65 .",
    "we take @xmath65 an order of magnitude higher than the single - crystal ybco critical current , @xcite namely @xmath66 a @xmath67 , and take @xmath68 k for @xmath69 a @xmath67 , of the order of magnitude of the kt transition temperature @xcite .",
    "the important friction coefficient is taken to be @xmath70 @xmath71 , from the bardeen - stephen formula @xcite applied to ybco films .",
    "a most sensitive parameter is related to the amplitude of the pinning potential , @xmath72 , which is entirely unknown .",
    "we have taken a negative @xmath73 , borrowing from classical nucleation the point of view that vortex production is actually aided by the presence of pinning centers .",
    "finally , @xmath74 @xmath75 concludes our illustrative case which is clearly of the confined - phase type . as @xmath12 ,",
    "we have taken @xmath76 , for simplicity s sake , and find no significant dependence on the most uncertain of all parameters , @xmath33 .",
    "its dimensions being the same as @xmath77 , we have taken @xmath78 . also , we take the film thickness @xmath79 @xmath75 as the typical interlayer spacing .",
    "figure 1 then represents our estimate of the expected values of the nucleation rate in the above experimental conditions .",
    "our claim is that both pair - production and current - oscillations should be observable with an appropriate technique ( e.g. tonomura s electron holography @xcite ) .",
    "we point out that , with no controlled pinning present , the decay of a supercurrent _ in the absence _ of a magnetic field has been measured experimentally in biscco films , see e.g. @xcite , though in this case edge tunneling ( which we discuss below ) also plays a role .",
    "finally , we briefly describe our theoretical treatment for evaluating the tunneling rate from the edge @xcite ( in the absence , however , of the periodic pinning potential ) .",
    "this is done by extending the treatment of section 2 to the case where the vortices are already present in the edge strip of the sample .",
    "this requires that , in the formula for the rate , eq .",
    "( [ rerate ] ) , the contribution from the antivortex paths is factored out and cancelled by the introduction of a suitable chemical potential @xmath80 . setting @xmath81 in order to simplify the treatment ( a finite @xmath82 results only in some renormalization ) ,",
    "the formula for the tunneling rate becomes :          and where the factor @xmath85 is fixed by a self - consistency procedure @xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath19 now contains the 2d coulomb potential binding the vortices to the edge strip , a distance @xmath86 away , and has the form @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 is the usual caldeira - leggett potential and @xmath89 the coulomb interaction strength . at this point",
    "the usual leading contribution to the @xmath56- and feynman path - integral is extracted , however by means of a saddle - point approximation with inclusion of the gaussian fluctuations @xcite , which yields the tunneling rate per unit length ( for an edge strip having width @xmath90 ) :          this yields almost the same leading dependence ( logarithmic corrections apart ) @xmath98 on the external current that was also obtained for the homogeneous bulk - nucleation phenomenon .",
    "indeed , the effective coulomb energy @xmath99 can be interpreted as playing the role of the activation energy @xmath38 renormalised by the vortex - antivortex interactions . as for the estimate of the edge tunneling rate",
    ", we use the same material parameters set up in section 3 , and in figure 2 we report the tunneling rate @xmath100 for different possible values of the coulomb strength @xmath89 .",
    "the conclusion is that both edge - tunneling ( normally dominant for small @xmath2 ) and bulk - nucleation can become important and concomitant mechanisms for supercurrent decay in a superconducting thin film .      for recent surveys of this field , see : g. blatter , m.v .",
