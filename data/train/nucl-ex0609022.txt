    "at rhic energies a strong suppression of high @xmath0  hadron production in nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions relative to p+p collisions has been observed  @xcite , which is usually attributed to the energy loss that the parent partons experience when transversing the color deconfined medium present in these collisions  @xcite . also , two particle correlations at high @xmath0  indicate a strong effect of the produced medium on the hadron emission pattern . at the lower sps energies on the other hand , the experimental situation was rather unclear and even contradictory . while , e.g. the energy density derived from the measured @xmath3 distributions , as well as the fact that the chemical freeze - out occurs very close to the theoretically expected phase boundary , suggest that a quark gluon plasma is already formed at top sps energies  @xcite , there was so far no indication of any high @xmath0  suppression at these energies .",
    "in fact , the wa98 data on the nuclear modification factor @xmath1  of neutral pions rather exhibited a cronin  type of enhancement @xcite .",
    "however , a reassessment of the p+p baseline @xcite allowed the conclusion that the data on pion production in central a+a reactions are consistent with the expectation in a jet quenching scenario with gluon densities of @xmath4 @xcite , more in line with the measured hadron multiplicities . a first study of two particle azimuthal correlations for @xmath5  by the na45 experiment @xcite , showed a structure that could be interpreted as a correlation of semi - hard particles on top of a collective flow component . similar to what has been seen at rhic ,",
    "the away - side peaks broadens with centrality , which might be attributed to in - medium effects .",
    "recently , new data on @xmath2  for identified particles have been presented by the na49 and na57 experiment @xcite .",
    "additionally , the na45 collaboration has done a refined analysis of two particle azimuthal correlations at high @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "these data help to clarify the current situation and shall be discussed in the following .",
    "as a function of @xmath0  for charged and neutral pions ( minimum bias p(d)+a data @xcite ) .",
    "right : @xmath6  at different fixed momenta as a function of @xmath7 . the grey band indicates the sps center - of - mass energy.,height=283 ]    as a function of @xmath0  for charged and neutral pions ( minimum bias p(d)+a data @xcite ) .",

    "the hatched box represents the typical normalization error from the @xmath8  determination .",
    "the lower hatched band is a theory prediction including energy loss , cronin effect and nuclear shadowing @xcite .",
    "the upper dashed band shows @xmath6  as measured in p+w at @xmath7  =  19.4  @xcite.,width=377 ]    in order to establish whether any kind of modification in the high @xmath0region is present in a+a collisions , reference data from p+p and p+a collisions are of high importance",
    ". unfortunately , there are no p+p(a ) data available at @xmath9  gev that cover the interesting @xmath0-region for a+a studies above 2  .",
    "recently , the na49 experiment has published charged pion spectra measured at this center - of - mass energy @xcite , but the statistics limits the @xmath0-reach to 2.1  .",
    "several attempts have been made to replace the missing data by an interpolation from lower and higher beam energies @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the parametrization suggested by blattnig et al .",
    "@xcite was used to construct a p+p baseline for neutral pions .",
    "this parametrization also agrees to the charge averaged pion spectra in the region measured by na49 at @xmath9  gev .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that at the center - of - mass energies under discussion here , the spectral shape in the higher @xmath0  region ( i.e. above @xmath0  = 2  ) changes drastically with energy since the kinematic limit becomes important here ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , any parametrization introduces a large systematic error .",
    "a specific problem in the interpretation of the sps data arises from the fact that the typical @xmath0-reach is in the region below 45  .",
    "this region is governed by an interplay of the cronin effect , which causes an enhancement in p+a collisions relative to p+p , and a potential suppression due to jet quenching .",
    "a proper understanding of the p+a data is therefore indispensable .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ firpa ] that shows the existing data on the nuclear modification factor @xmath6at different center - of - mass energies @xcite .",
    "@xmath6  increases by approximately a factor 2 when going from @xmath7  =  200  gev down to @xmath7  =  19.4  gev at @xmath10  .",
    "this is not unexpected since due to the steeper spectral shape at lower energies @xmath6  is more sensitive to @xmath0  broadening effects .",
    "according to the data from serpukhov at @xmath7  =  11.5  gev @xcite , @xmath6  increases towards lower energies even more rapidly , making interpolations very difficult .",

    "@xcite , as already suggested in @xcite .",
    "a new feature in this figure are the recent na49 data that extend the @xmath0-reach up to 4.5  .",
    "bearing in mind all the caveats described in the previous section , the shown @xmath1  values are consistent with the theoretical expectation for an energy loss scenario at realistic gluon densities of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "they are clearly below the @xmath6  values measured at slighly higher @xmath7 , which should provide a lower bound on the expected @xmath6  at sps .     for pions and h@xmath12 at @xmath13   @xcite .",

    "an interesting question is whether this is just a reflection of a similar energy dependence of the cronin effect or due to a dramatic increase of the parton energy loss .",

    "[ fircpdep ] ) , even though the overall scale is naturally lower at higher energies .",

    "the method and the choice of the @xmath0-ranges ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) are identical to an analysis performed by the phenix collaboration at @xmath7  =  200  gev @xcite .",
    "the away side structure observed at sps is clearly broader than a p+p like di - jet expectation , as e.g. predicted by pythia , and the width does not depend significantly on centrality .",
    "however , an indication for a modification of its shape with centrality is observed : the away - side structure seems to develop a flat top for central events . even though this modification of the shape is much stronger at rhic , this observations are qualitatively similar at both energies and might in both case be indicative for partonic interaction with the produced medium .",
    "the mass hierarchy observed in the @xmath2  values at sps might point to the fact that the quark coalescence approach , that has been proposed to explain the large baryon / meson ratios at intermediate @xmath0  observed at rhic @xcite , might also be valid at sps energies .",
