    "ultracold atom physics has undergone spectacular development in the last two decades . during the last years , after the first theoretical proposal to simulate the bose - hubbard model with ultracold bosons in an optical lattice @xcite and its successful experimental realization @xcite , considerable theoretical and experimental progress has been made on degenerate quantum gases in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "one major common goal shared by these efforts is to simulate typical systems or minimal models of condensed matter physics , e.g. the hubbard model , using ultracold atoms confined in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "it is expected that these investigations can give key insights into unresolved open questions in condensed matter physics , e.g. the mechanism of high-@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "usually , interactions in cold gases are isotropic and short ranged .",
    "naturally one can ask the question which type of new physics would arise in these systems if the atoms have additional long - range anisotropic interactions .    as a matter of fact",
    ", a wealth of interesting physics has already been revealed by theoretical and experimental investigations of ultracold dipolar bose gases both in harmonic traps @xcite and optical lattices @xcite .",
    "in contrast to dipolar bose gases , due to the pauli exclusion principle , dipolar effects in fermionic systems can manifest themselves only if the dipolar interaction energy is at least of the order of the fermi energy .",
    "although there have been already some theoretical investigations on these systems @xcite , this condition could hardly be reached experimentally until the recent successful realization of a degenerate quantum gas of fermionic @xmath1k@xmath2rb polar molecules @xcite . with this achievement ,",
    "the door towards exploring the many - body physics originating from dipole - dipole interactions in fermionic systems has been opened , which has already lead to a number of theoretical investigations on these systems @xcite . motivated by experimental progress on ultracold polar molecules , here we investigate the low temperature quantum phases of a system of cold polar fermions loaded into a 2d square optical lattice .",
    "the rest part of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the system and the model studied here . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe the theoretical approach used in our investigation . in sec .",
    "iv , the main section of this paper , we present a detailed discussion of the quantum phases at both zero and finite temperature . finally , we conclude in sec . v.",
    "motivated by ongoing experiments , we focus our investigations on possible setups based on @xmath1k@xmath2rb molecules which have a permanent electric dipole moment of @xmath3 debye ( d ) , where @xmath4 .",
    "however the effective dipole moment in the laboratory frame is zero in the absence of an external electric field .",
    "when an external electric field is applied the molecules align with the field and have an induced dipole moment @xmath5 which increases with the strength of the external field . currently , the experimentally accessible range of @xmath5 is @xmath6 $ ] @xcite . in this work",
    "we assume the external electric field is oriented perpendicular to the optical lattice plane .",
    "loading the molecules into an optical lattice , the physics of this system for sufficiently low filling can be captured by an extended hubbard model within the lowest band approximation,@xmath7 here , @xmath8 denotes nearest - neighbour sites , @xmath9(@xmath10 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a fermionic molecule with spin @xmath11 on site @xmath12 in the wannier representation , and @xmath13 is the particle number operator . the first term in eq .",
    "( @xmath14 ) describes the kinetic energy with @xmath15 being the hopping amplitude ; the second term represents the onsite interaction @xmath16 between molecules with opposite spin ; the third term originates from the long - range dipole - dipole interactions , where @xmath17 characterizes the dipole - dipole interaction strength with @xmath18 and @xmath19 being the lattice constant and the vacuum permittivity respectively , and @xmath20 is the dimensionless position vector of lattice site @xmath12 ; finally , in the last term @xmath21 denotes the chemical potential .    in our calculations",
    "we assume a 2d optical lattice created by laser beams with wavelength @xmath22 as used in the experimental setup of ref .",
    "we consider the following parameters : the height of the lattice potential in the direction perpendicular to the lattice plane @xmath23 and parallel to the plane @xmath24 are chosen as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the recoil energy , @xmath28 is the mass of molecule and @xmath29 is planck s constant . under these conditions , the dipolar interaction strength is in the range @xmath30 $ ] , and the hopping amplitude is approximately @xmath31 .",
    "therefore the ratio between the dipolar interaction strength and the hopping amplitude @xmath32 is approximately in the range @xmath33 $ ] , which we assume in our calculations .    a good estimate of the strength of the onsite interaction @xmath16 requires a detailed study of all types of short - range interactions between the polar molecules , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "since the main aim of this work is to investigate the possibility of observing a supersolid phase of polar molecules , we assume that the onsite interaction is attractive , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , we notice that since large attractive on - site interactions will make the system unstable , the region of @xmath35 investigated in this work is restricted to @xmath36 $ ] .    on the route towards observing the supersolid phase in experiments",
    ", the temperature plays a dominant role . in current experiments with polar molecules in a harmonic trap ,",
    "the lowest temperature which can be reached is of the order of the fermi temperature @xmath37 @xcite . also , when the lattice potential is ramped up , generally , the molecules will be heated in this process , which results in even higher temperatures . in the following ,",
    "the system is studied at both zero and finite temperatures , and the temperature region where a supersolid phase can be possibly observed is determined .",
    "before discussing our results in detail , we give a brief description of our theoretical approach . in polar molecule systems , we have to consider not only the on - site attraction of the molecules but also the inter - site repulsion due to the dipolar interaction . for treating the on - site interactions , the dynamical mean - field theory",
    "( dmft ) @xcite is well suited since it is non - perturbative , captures the local quantum fluctuation exactly , and gives exact results in the infinite - dimensional limit . for long - ranged interactions in fermionic system , on the other hand ,",
    "there are , to our knowledge , up to now only few efficient ways to treat them , although dmft has already been generalized to the so called cellular dmft in order to treat short - range inter - site interactions @xcite .",
    "we include long - range interactions as follows .",
    "first we notice that in the high - dimensional limit inter - site interactions only contribute on the hartree level @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the hartree term of the inter - site interaction will dominate as the spatial dimension of the system increases .",
    "this motivates us to keep only the hartree contribution of the inter - site interaction in the hamiltonian as an approximation to the original hamiltonian ( [ eq : hami ] ) , i.e. @xmath38 our dmft hamiltonian therefore takes the form @xmath39 where@xmath40 and we have rescaled the chemical potential @xmath21 in ( [ eq : hf_hamiltonian ] ) according to the trivial constant term in ( [ eq : hf_deouple ] ) .",
    "we investigate this system using real - space dmft ( r - dmft)@xcite , which is an extension of dmft to a position - dependent self - energy and fully captures the inhomogeneity of the system . within dmft",
    "/ r - dmft , the physics on each lattice site is determined from a local effective action which can be captured by an effective anderson impurity model @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use exact diagonalization ( ed ) @xcite of the anderson impurity hamiltonian to solve the local action .",
    "details of the r - dmft method can be found in previous works @xcite .    within each r - dmft iteration ,",
    "the hartree contributions @xmath41 are calculated and the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hf_hamiltonian ] ) is updated according to the new values @xmath41 .",
    "this modified r - dmft iteration is repeated until a convergent solution is obtained .",
    "at zero temperature , the main properties of the system are summarized in the phase diagram in fig .  [",
    "flo : pd_12x12 ] , which shows the phase boundary between the supersolid ( ss ) phase and the homogeneous singlet superfluid phase ( hsf ) at different onsite interaction strengths @xmath16 in terms of the filling factor @xmath42 and the dipolar interaction strength @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "this phase diagram is based on calculations for a @xmath45 square lattice .",
    "we will denote the phase boundary between the supersolid ( ss ) phase and the homogeneous singlet superfluid phase the _ ss - hsf boundary _ in the following .    along the vertical line at half filling ( @xmath46 ) in fig .",
    "[ flo : pd_12x12 ] , irrespective of the strengths of on - site and inter - site interactions , the system is always in an incompressible charge density wave ( cdw ) phase , which is characterized both by vanishing compressibility @xmath47 and a finite density modulation in real space .",
    "more specifically , the density distribution over the lattice has a checkerboard ( cb ) structure , which is characterized by @xmath48@xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in our calculations ,",
    "we choose @xmath52 as the cdw order parameter and we will denote this incompressible cdw phase as `` cb solid '' .    away from half filling but still in the region bounded by the ss - hsf boundary and the vertical line of half filling , a supersolid phase is obtained by doping the cb solid with either particles or vacancies , which is characterized by the coexistence of the singlet pairing order parameter @xmath53 and the cdw order @xmath52 . as we can see from fig .  [",
    "flo : pd_12x12 ] , at fixed on - site interaction strength @xmath16 , the filling region in which the system remains supersolid increases with the strength of the dipolar interaction .",
    "this can be understood by the following simple argument .",
    "we notice that near the ss - hsf boundary the dominant contribution to the inter - site interaction energy between two nearest neighbor sites @xmath54 is positive and approximately proportional to @xmath55 , therefore a larger @xmath43 will make the system more likely to favor a modulated density distribution since it can lower the intersite interaction energy in this way . on the other hand , at fixed dipolar interaction strength @xmath43 , we can see from fig .",
    "[ flo : pd_12x12 ] that a larger on - site attraction strength @xmath35 corresponds to a larger supersolid filling factor region .",
    "this can be understood by a similar argument as above .",
    "we notice that near the ss - hsf boundary the total on - site interaction energy of two neighboring sites is approximately proportional to @xmath56 , one can thus easily see that for large @xmath35 the system will favor a large density imbalance between neighboring sites which results in a modulated density distribution .    concerning the proposed experimental setup with @xmath1k@xmath2rb molecules in an optical lattice , according to the discussions above , the supersolid phase will be observed more easily in an interaction region with relatively large dipolar interaction and onsite attraction , since this will stabilize the supersolid in a large filling factor region , e.g. in the range @xmath57 for interaction strengths @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    on the right - hand side of the ss - hsf boundary ,",
    "the system is in a homogeneous singlet superfluid phase which is characterized by a uniform distribution of both the density @xmath60 and the singlet paring order parameter @xmath61 .",
    "we note that in the classical limit of zero hopping , the long - range interacting model exhibits a devil s staircase of various solid phases @xcite .",
    "therefore , for much larger @xmath43 , which far exceeds the region investigated in this work , one would expect to find other types of incompressible cdw phases rather than cb solid and possibly new ss phases similar to those found for dipolar bose gases in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "a detailed investigation of this `` devil s staircase '' in the quantum case is beyond the scope of this current work .     and the strength of dipolar interaction @xmath43 , obtained from calculations on a @xmath45 square lattice .",

    "moreover in the ss phase the amplitude of the pairing order parameter @xmath61 also has a similar spatial checkerboard modulation . in the hsf phase both the density and the pairing order parameter are constant over the lattice .",
