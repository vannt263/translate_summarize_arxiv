    "the transient x - ray source  was discovered during a slew of the proportional counter array ( pca ) on the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) on feb .",
    "6.84 , 2000 , when it had a 2 to 10 kev flux of @xmath5  erg  @xmath6s@xmath4 ( marshall , takeshima & in t zand 2000 ) .",
    "a subsequent pointed pca observation on feb .",
    "10.69 showed a similar intensity and revealed a pulsar with a period of 27.12@xmath7  s. later , the pulsar was found in earlier data from the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the compton gamma - ray observatory ; the first detection of the pulsar was on jan .",
    "25 ( finger & wilson 2000 ) .",
    "the most accurate location was recently determined by serendipitous observations with the wide field cameras on bepposax : @xmath8 , @xmath9 with a 99% confidence region delimited by a circle with a radius of 2@xmath10 ( kaptein , in t zand & heise 2001 ) .",
    "thus far , no optical counterpart has been reported",
    ".    continues to be active one year after discovery and is being monitored through regular pointed pca observations .",
    "we here discuss the results from a timing analysis of data from the first year of monitoring , and report the discovery of the binary orbit of , present the light curve and discuss implications for the companion of the neutron star .",
    "a target - of - opportunity program was initiated after the discovery with rxte to monitor the pulsar and to try to detect doppler delays from a binary orbit .",
    "the frequency of the observations went from once every day for the first 7 days , to once every 2 days during the next 10 days , to once every 3 days during the next 75 days , and finally to once every week for the remainder of the time .",
    "weekly observations still continued one year after discovery .",
    "we here report about the first year of observations ( i.e. , up to feb . 3 , 2001 )",
    "for which the total accumulated net exposure time is 172  ks .",
    "the number of observations is 77 .",
    "most observations were carried out over two consecutive rxte orbits with a total span of 1.9  hr , but the time span has been as high as 5.5  hr . we discuss measurements that were carried out with the pca on rxte .",
    "this instrument ( for a detailed description , see jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) consists of an array of 5 co - aligned proportional counter units ( pcus ) that are sensitive to photons of energy 2 to 60 kev with a total collecting area of 6500  @xmath11 .",
    "the spectral resolution is 18% full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) at 6 kev and the field of view is 1@xmath12 fwhm . during the observations",
    "the number of active pcus varied between 1 and 5 .",
    "we extracted spectra for each rxte orbit of observation , for all active pcus combined , and for layer 1 only .",
    "all spectra were successfully modeled between 3 and 20 kev using a power - law function with low - energy absorption ( following morrison & mccammon 1983 ) , multiplied with an exponential cutoff function and supplemented with a narrow emission line near 6.5  kev which may be identified with fe - k line emission for neutral to c - like ionization states and which has a constant equivalent width of @xmath13  kev .",
    "figure  [ fighistory1 ] presents the best - fit spectral parameters and 3 - 20 kev flux as a function of time , with a time resolution of one observation .",
    "the light curve exhibits variability on a time scale of weeks .",
    "the peak was reached about 90 days after discovery and is nine times the lowest flux levels observed thus far . outside",
    "this main peak , the flux occasionally reaches half the peak value .",
    "there is no obvious periodicity .",
    "we also studied the light curve as measured with the all - sky monitor on rxte since 1996 .",
    "this light curve is quite noisy because of the small flux .",
    "there is no conclusive evidence for outbursts other than the one reported here , and there is no indication that  was ever brighter than the flux levels measured with the pca .      for the study of the pulse period , we employed event data with 0.5  s time resolution and 64 readout channels for photon energy ( i.e. , configuration e_500us_64m_0_1s ) .",
    "we optimized the accuracy of the pulse period determination as a function of detector layers and bandpasses and find the best result if all layers are included and photons with energies higher than 20 kev excluded , although this optimum is only marginally better than if only layer 1 is included .",
    "we combined the data from all active pcus , applied standard filters to eliminate bad data , and corrected the resulting light curves to the solar system barycenter .",
    "the latter includes a correction for the satellite orbit . for each of the observations",
    ", we measured the pulse period by epoch folding the data for a relevant range of test periods and calculating the @xmath14 values for a constant flux hypothesis .",
    "the resulting curves show sinc - like trends . to obtain the best - fit period we fitted for each observation the peak curve with a 3rd degree polynomial and identified the period with the peak position of the cubic function .",
    "the 68% confidence error was estimated by determining the range of periods for which the @xmath14 value is within 1 from the maximum .",
    "this procedure was verified through monte carlo simulations .",
    "the resulting measurements are presented in figure  [ fighistory2 ] .",
    "they are supplemented with 78 batse measurements from the public domain and from finger & wilson ( 2000 ) , pertaining to tjd  11572 - 11678 ( tjd  =  jd@xmath15 ) .",
    "the batse observations stopped prior to de - orbiting the satellite in june 2000 .",
    "figure  [ fighistory2 ] clearly shows that there is a 75  d periodicity which must be due to an expected binary orbit .",
    "also , long time scale spin - up trends are visible which are expected to result from accretion torque .",
    "the spin - up is faster in the first @xmath16  days which is consistent with an accretion torque explanation because the flux and , therefore , the accretion rate is larger at that time .    in order to disentangle the orbital modulation from the spin up trend , we modeled in an initial step the orbital modulation through a simple sinusoidal variation .",
    "the spin up was modeled through various simple functions with similar success and we here present the results when the period derivative @xmath17 is described by a gaussian function on top of a flat , non - zero , level .",
    "we only modeled the data after tjd  11610 because the spin up seems to be more complex before that . for the determination of the orbit",
    "this is not detrimental because the excluded time interval represents only about 5% of the complete time span of the observations .",
    "the results of the modeling are presented in figure  [ fighistory2 ] . in a second step",
    ", we subtracted the model for the spin up from the data and fitted a model of an eccentric binary orbit to the residuals .",
    "the best - fit @xmath18 is rather high at 10.2 ( for 118 degrees of freedom @xmath19 ) , which we attribute to an incomplete spin - up model . in order to obtain estimates for the errors in the model parameters that take into account the systematic uncertainties",
    ", we forced @xmath18 to 1 through a multiplication of all pulse period errors with a constant factor @xmath20 .",
    "the results for the orbital and spin - up parameters are given in table  [ pulsefit ] . in figure  [ fighistory2 ] ( bottom panel )",
    "we plot the data after subtraction of the orbital modulation model , in figure  [ figfold ] after subtraction of the spin - up model and folding with the orbital period . as a double check",
    ", we carried out the same procedure for the data after tjd  11670 which excludes the times when the gaussian component of the spin - up model is important .",
    "thus , possible strong systematic errors are avoided at the expense of accuracy .",
    "the result , given in an extra column in table  [ pulsefit ] , is consistent with the previous result .",
    ".fit parameters to pulse period history[pulsefit ] .",
    "the errors are for 68% confidence .",
    "the numbers in the third column are , as a reference , from data after tjd  11670 ( 40 data points ) [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     the pulse profile was studied for 3 observations throughout the total observation span , see figure  [ figprofile ] for the profile at flux peak .",
    "the profile consists of two broad peaks at a phase difference of 0.5 and with different magnitudes .",
    "the pulsed fraction is consistently 65@xmath21% .",
    "this kind of profile and amplitude is not unusual for pulsars among high - mass x - ray binaries ( c.f .",
    ", bildsten et al .",
    "1997 and white et al .",
    "we determined the profiles in two energy bands ( 2 to 10 kev and 10 to 20 kev ) and do not find strong morphological differences .",
    "the pulse fraction is about 10% higher in the upper energy band .",
    "given the projected semi - major axis @xmath22 and @xmath23 , we can place constraints on the companion of the neutron star . the mass function is @xmath24 if @xmath25  m@xmath26 , this implies a minimum mass for the companion star of 10.0  m@xmath26 . for a main sequence star , the implied spectral type is b3 or earlier ( zombeck 1990 ) .",
    "the orbital period places  in the corbet diagram of pulse period versus orbital period unambiguously on the branch of optically confirmed be transients ( corbet et al .",
    "1986 , c.f .",
    "bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in principle",
    "the distance is constrained by the spin - up rate and flux .",
    "the flux is a measure of the mass accretion rate which determines the torque on the neutron star and the spin - up rate .",
    "given the steadiness of the spin - up rate , we consider it likely that the accretion occurs through a disk . in that case",
    "ghosh & lamb ( 1979 ) predict a spin - up rate of @xmath27 for a neutron star with magnetic dipole moment @xmath28 in units of 10@xmath29  g  @xmath30 , mass @xmath31 in units of 1.4  m@xmath26 , radius @xmath32 in units of 10  km , moment of inertia @xmath33 in units of 10@xmath34  g  @xmath11 , and luminosity @xmath35 in units of 10@xmath3  erg  s@xmath4 . in figure  [ figghosh ]",
    "we present the period derivative as a function of 3 - 20 kev flux .",
    "our data are rather noisy and do not cover a large dynamic range in flux , but they appear to be roughly consistent with a 6/7 power law relationship . given the spectral shapes found , the overall bolometric correction is about a factor of 2 .",
    "if we calibrate the above @xmath36 relation at the @xmath37 s  s@xmath4 level and assume all normalized parameters to be 1 , the implied distance is 26  kpc .",
    "this would place  at an unlikely position .",
    "acceptable distances would perhaps be at least about 50% smaller .",
    "it is hard to achieve that by adjusting the other parameters individually : @xmath28 would have to be at least 64 times larger , @xmath31 16 times smaller , @xmath32 4 times larger , or @xmath33 3 times smaller .",
    "therefore , given the correctness of the ghosh & lamb formulation , there is at least the suggestion that the distance is large .",
    "another constraint for the distance , that does not require @xmath38 , may be obtained from an argument over the magnetospheric radius @xmath39 at which the neutron star magnetosphere begins to dictate the mass flow",
    ". this radius scales with @xmath40 or @xmath41 . if the flux @xmath42 varies between @xmath43 and @xmath44 at times when the mass accretion persists , @xmath45 at peak flux , where @xmath46 is the co - rotation radius at which the keplerian period is equal to the spin period ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the torque @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 .",
    "substition in the above condition reveals @xmath50 for standard parameters and @xmath51 ( after tjd  11670 ) , we obtain @xmath52  m@xmath26yr@xmath4 .",
    "if all liberated potential energy is released in the form of radiation , the bolometric luminosity is constrained by @xmath53  erg  s@xmath4 . for @xmath54",
    "erg  s@xmath4@xmath6 and a bolometric correction of 2 , a minimum distance of 10  kpc is implied .",
    "again this is a fairly large distance .",
    "these distance estimates suggest that searches for the optical counterpart may prove difficult , also because the large value of @xmath55 points to a high extinction . for a 10.0  m@xmath26 main sequence star , @xmath56 . if @xmath57 ( see figure  [ fighistory1 ] ; this is consistent with the total galactic column as inferred from maps by dickey & lockman 1990 ) , @xmath58 ( according to the standard conversions introduced by predehl & schmitt 1995 ) . for a distance of 26  kpc , the apparent visual magnitude would be @xmath59 , for a distance of 10  kpc , @xmath60 .",
    "the most interesting result of our analysis is the low eccentricity .",
    "it is among the lowest for the 12 confirmed or suspected be x - ray binaries whose orbits have now been determined ( 8 cases are reviewed by bildsten et al .",
    "1997 and since then orbits have been determined for 2s 1845 - 024 by finger et al .",
    "1999 , for sax  j2103.5 + 4545 by baykal , stark & swank 2000 , and for x per by delgado - mart et al .",
    "there is one other system apart from  which has an eccentricity that is consistent with 0 ( @xmath61 at @xmath62 confidence for 2s  1553 - 54 , see kelley et al .",
    "however , one should note that kelley et al .",
    "have a sparse coverage of less than one binary orbit and do not solve for spin - up . finding low - eccentricity systems is remarkable because one would expect most long - period be systems to have undergone supernovae with large kick velocities for the neutron stars and to have circularization time scales far longer than their age .",
    "confirms the suspicion that there may be a substantial population of neutron stars formed with little or no kick ( delgado - martet al . 2001 ) .",
    "we thank the project scientist jean swank for continuing the rxte observations of  through public toos after our too program time was spent , evan smith for his tireless efforts to schedule the many observations , mike tripicco for his assistance in the barycentric corrections for 2001 pca data , ron remillard for his advice on the asm light curve , and the referee mark finger for valuable suggestions .",
