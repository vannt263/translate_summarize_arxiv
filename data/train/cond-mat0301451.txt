    "the effect of electron - electron interaction on the electrical conductivity of disordered systems has been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally over the past two decades@xcite .",
    "there are two main types of correction to the drude electrical conductivity which can have similar magnitudes and temperature dependences : weak localization and interaction effects .",
    "weak localization is due to interference between pairs of time - reversed scattering trajectories of electrons from impurities ; this effect can occur in a non - interacting system .",
    "interaction effects are due to the increased effective electron - electron interaction strength due to incomplete screening by diffusively moving electrons",
    ". experimentally the two effects can be distinguished by applying a magnetic field ; weak localization is suppressed whilst interaction effects are not .    in comparison",
    "there has been relatively little work done on the thermal conductivity , either theoretically or experimentally .",
    "this is largely because thermal conductivity is hard to measure in low - dimensional systems at low temperature , and it is difficult to separate the electronic and lattice contributions .",
    "it is therefore doubly hard to observe the disorder - driven corrections to the electronic thermal conductivity .",
    "moreover there have been theoretical predictions@xcite that the wiedemann - franz law holds , which allows one to deduce the thermal conductivity , @xmath0 , directly from the electrical conductivity , @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath4 is the electronic charge , @xmath5 is the temperature , and @xmath6 is known as the lorenz number .",
    "clearly it is important to establish whether the wiedemann - franz law is valid in interacting disordered systems ; if it is , there is nothing to be gained from measuring the thermal conductivity in addition to the electrical conductivity .    in this paper",
    "we evaluate the interaction corrections to the thermal conductivity in one , two and three dimensions in both the singlet and triplet channels .",
    "we find that the wiedemann - franz law is violated in all cases .",
    "our results are presented in detail in table 1 .",
    "we have not included a result for the singlet channel in one dimension since this is just one third of the corresponding triplet channel result with @xmath7 replaced by an effective singlet channel interaction @xmath8 , as explained in the figure caption .",
    "each term consists of two pieces : the first piece leads to violation of the wiedemann - franz law ; the second piece does not .",
    "the exception is the triplet channel in two dimensions which does not possess a violating piece .",
    "note that in each case both terms have the same parametric dependences ; it is only the constant prefactors which are different .",
    "our calculation is the exact analogue of the original altshuler - aronov calculation for electrical conductivity@xcite .",
    "there have been several previous attempts at this calculation@xcite ; however these are in disagreement with each other , and we believe all of them to be incorrect .",
    "the fact that it has taken so long ( over twenty years ) to get the correct result for the thermal conductivity is due to three inherent difficulties in the problem .",
    "first , the heat - current operator is not uniquely defined , and some choices of definition will be renormalized by the electron - electron interaction@xcite .",
    "second , the heat - current operator has opposite electron - hole parity to the charge - current operator , which leads to the presence of an extra `` heat - drag '' diagram for the thermal conductivity which is vanishingly small for the electrical conductivity .",
    "( we use the term `` heat - drag '' by analogy to the coulomb drag effect between two layers of electrons ; this effect is described by the same diagram@xcite ) .",
    "third , spurious ultraviolet divergences occur in the diagrammatic approach to thermal conductivity ; these can be understood and evaluated within the framework of divergent series theory@xcite ( their origin is due to illegal series expansions in the derivation of the perturbation theory ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     before we proceed to the details of our calculation , we present a short history of the field",
    ". we will first consider effects which do not require interaction , such as weak localization and the anderson transition .",
    "chester and thellung@xcite used an exact eigenstates approach to show that the wiedemann - franz law should hold in a non - interacting disordered system , independent of the strength of impurity scattering .",
    "strinati and castellani@xcite used a ward identity construction to argue that the wiedemann - franz law holds all the way to the anderson transition .",
    "kearney and butcher@xcite used the exact eigenstates approach of chester and thellung to deduce the weak localization correction to thermal conductivity .",
    "this effect was later seen in the experiment of bayot et al@xcite , which measured the electrical and thermal magnetoconductance , which were found to obey the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "enderby and barnes@xcite later pointed out that the wiedemann - franz law is not obeyed at the anderson transition  the previous treatments all use the sommerfeld expansion , which is not valid close to the anderson transition .",
    "however the only effect is to decrease the constant in the lorenz number from @xmath9 to @xmath10 for a conductivity exponent @xmath11 .",
    "the overall conclusion for the non - interacting effects is that there is no extra information in the thermal conductivity that is not present in the electrical conductivity . in the weak localization regime",
    "the wiedemann - franz law holds ; close to the anderson transition it is only modified by a simple numerical factor , so all critical properties are correctly predicted by it .",
    "it would therefore seem that the only possibility of interesting behavior lies with the interaction corrections to thermal conductivity .",
    "castellani et al@xcite predicted that the wiedemann - franz law would hold even for the interacting disordered system .",
    "these authors evaluated the dynamic energy - energy correlation function in the interacting system using a skeleton graph analysis , and derived the thermal conductivity from this . since their method of calculation is somewhat different from ours , it is not obvious to us why they obtain a different result .",
    "livanov et al@xcite later directly calculated the interaction corrections using a quantum kinetic equation approach , and predicted that the wiedemann - franz law is violated in all dimensions .",
    "they appear to have evaluated some interaction contributions correctly , but to have missed other contributions of the same order of magnitude ; for example , in two dimensions , they predict a logarithmic increase in @xmath12 at low temperature rather than the correct logarithmic decrease .",
    "we believe that the results obtained initially from their diagrammatic formalism are correct , and that they have then erroneously thrown away some terms believing them to be smaller in magnitude .",
    "arfi@xcite performed the equivalent calculation in the matsubara formalism and again found violation of the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "however this calculation has errors relating to all three of the difficulties referred to previously : ( a ) the matsubara form of heat current is used , but the heat current is then erroneously renormalized by interaction ; ( b ) the `` heat drag '' or aslamazov - larkin - like diagram is omitted ; ( c ) the final results are parametrically larger than those for electrical conductivity by factors of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the elastic scattering time , which appears to be due to incorrect treatment of spuriously divergent terms , as will be described later .",
    "the aim of the present work is therefore to resolve the discrepancies between previous calculations and to present the first consistent calculation of the interaction correction to thermal conductivity .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we derive the drude contribution to electronic thermal conductivity ; in section 3 we present an outline of the calculation of the interaction corrections to thermal conductivity ; finally in section 4 we analyse our results and draw conclusions .",
    "before we proceed to the calculation of the interaction corrections , we demonstrate the simplicity and elegance of the matsubara approach to evaluating thermal conductivity by deriving the drude result . the thermal conductivity is obtained from the imaginary time heat response kernel , @xmath15 , by analytic continuation from positive bose matsubara frequencies , @xmath16 , @xmath17_{i\\omega_p\\rightarrow\\omega+i0 } \\ ] ] the feynman diagram for the drude thermal conductivity",
    "is shown in fig . 1 .        the solid lines are disordered electron green functions @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a fermi matsubara frequency , @xmath20 is the electronic excitation spectrum , and @xmath14 is the elastic scattering time .",
    "the black dots represent heat - current vertices , which are given by @xmath21 in the matsubara frequency representation that we use .",
    "the heat current kernel is then given by @xmath22 ^ 2\\times\\nonumber\\\\ g(k , i\\epsilon_l)g(k , i\\epsilon_l + i\\omega_p)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] performing the @xmath23-integral , we only obtain a non - zero result if the frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath25 have opposite sign , which means that the @xmath25 is restricted to the range @xmath26 . upon changing the sign of @xmath25",
    "we obtain @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the single - spin electronic density of states at the fermi surface .",
    "we see that the response function is isotropic , so we drop the spatial indices .",
    "we can then perform the @xmath25 sum to obtain @xmath29 and we finally extract @xmath0 using eq .",
    "( [ qdef ] ) to get the drude result @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the electron number density and we have used the einstein relation @xmath32 . from the corresponding drude formula for electrical conductivity , @xmath33 , we see that the wiedemann - franz law is obeyed ( note that @xmath34 and @xmath35 in our calculations ) .",
    "this diagrammatic technique offers a simple proof that the wiedemann - franz law is obeyed for a non - interacting disordered system with arbitrary disorder strength . for any diagrammatic contribution to electrical conductivity ,",
    "@xmath1 , there is a corresponding contribution to thermal conductivity , @xmath0 .",
    "moreover the corresponding expressions differ only in the form of the current vertices , yielding a factor @xmath36 for @xmath1 , and @xmath37 ^ 2/m^2 $ ] for @xmath0 .",
    "the only essential difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 then lies in the frequency sums ; the ratio of these two sums is independent of disorder and leads to the wiedemann - franz ratio . in particular , the weak localization correction to thermal conductivity is obtained directly from the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "note that this proof relies on the sommerfeld expansion since we are linearising our energy integrals about the fermi surface .",
    "interaction effects can violate the wiedemann - franz law since the presence of an interaction line can alter the matsubara frequencies at the two current vertices .",
    "in this section we calculate the interaction corrections arising from the singlet and triplet interaction channels @xcite  we do not evaluate cooperonic contributions since these are expected to be small for a system with repulsive interactions . in the singlet channel",
    "the dominant contribution arises from small energy and momentum transfers between electrons .",
    "this is dominated by the bare coulomb interaction , which takes the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the dimensionality , and @xmath40 is a measure of the transverse width in a quasi - one dimensional wire .",
    "the disorder - screened singlet interaction then takes the form @xmath41 where the polarization operator @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 if any integrals we obtain involving @xmath44 are convergent at small momentum , @xmath45 , we can ignore the @xmath46        term in eq .",
    "( [ vsdef ] ) in comparison to @xmath42 ; @xmath44 then takes the universal form , @xmath47 in the triplet channel the dominant contribution arises from momentum transfers of the order of @xmath48 , and the unsceened triplet interaction can be treated as a constant .",
    "the disorder screened triplet interaction then takes the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the bare interaction in the triplet channel@xcite . note that @xmath7 includes fermi liquid corrections in the absence of disorder ( it is only unscreened with respect to the disorder ) .",
    "@xmath7 may be determined from the measured paramagnetic spin susceptibility in the experimental system of interest @xmath52 if we first calculate the contribution from the singlet channel , we can then obtain the corresponding result for the triplet channel by replacing @xmath53 by @xmath54 and multiplying by @xmath55  the extra factor of @xmath55 arises because there are @xmath55 times as many modes in the spin - one channel than in the spin - zero channel .    applying standard perturbation theory we find that the leading order interaction corrections are given by the feynman diagrams shown in fig .",
    "these diagrams are identical to those considered by altshuler and aronov for the electrical conductivity@xcite , with the exception of diagram ( f ) which we call the `` heat - drag '' term .",
    "the corresponding diagram for electrical conductivity is a factor @xmath56 smaller than the other diagrams due to cancellation of electron and hole charge currents ; the heat current has opposite electron - hole parity and thus electron and hole heat currents reinforce each other .",
    "consequently diagram ( f ) is of the same size as the other diagrams in the case of thermal conductivity . the use of the matsubara heat current vertex defined in eq .",
    "( [ jdef ] ) ensures that no interaction renormalization of vertices is needed , greatly simplifying the calculation with respect to other choices of heat current operator ( obviously the final results must be independent of this choice ) .",
    "details of the calculation of the contributions from diagrams a ",
    "f to the heat - current response function , @xmath57 , are presented in the appendix ( note that in the following we suppress the subscripts on matsubara frequencies @xmath16 and @xmath58 for convenience ) .",
    "it is shown there that @xmath59 vanishes , as it must for internal consistency , and that @xmath60 may be written as the limit of the expression    @xmath61 { v(q,\\omega)\\over ( dq^2+\\omega)^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & -{16\\over 3d}\\pi^2t^2n(0)d\\left[t\\sum_{\\omega>0}+ { t\\over\\omega}\\sum_{0<\\omega\\le\\omega}\\omega\\right]\\sum_q { dq^2v(q,\\omega)\\over ( dq^2+\\omega)^3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath62 { dq^2v(q,\\omega)\\over ( dq^2+\\omega)^4}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as @xmath63 tends to zero . as explained in the appendix ,",
    "this statement is to be interpeted in the sense of first continuing @xmath64 to real frequencies , and then taking the limit of real frequency going to zero . the second line of eq .",
    "( [ kappat ] ) is just the interaction contribution to the electrical conductivity multiplied by the factor @xmath65 . in other words",
    ", this is the contribution to @xmath60 predicted by the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "the other two terms thus lead to violation of the wiedemann - franz law if they yield a non - zero result ( as we indeed find that they do ) .",
    "the expressions in eq .",
    "( [ kappat ] ) may now be evaluated in one , two and three dimensions for both the singlet and triplet interactions to yield the results listed in table 1 .",
    "note that all three terms in eq .",
    "( [ kappat ] ) give results having the same parametric form but with different constant prefactors ; we must therefore evaluate all of them to get a correct final result .",
    "this statement is not quite true in two dimensions because of the presence of logarithmic terms , and we should keep the most singular terms in this case .",
    "we have calculated the interaction corrections to thermal conductivity in the diffusive regime of a disordered conductor .",
    "our main result is that the wiedemann - franz law is violated in all dimensions ; the predicted interaction results have the expected parametric dependences , but different numerical coefficients .",
    "for example , in the singlet channel in two dimensions , the actual logarithmic correction is half that predicted by the wiedemann - franz law . unfortunately the experimental work of bayot et al@xcite is the only work we know of on thermal conductivity in disordered conductors , and this only isolates a weak localization contribution .",
    "we hope that further experiments will be performed in this area , and that the interaction correction be observed as well as the weak localization correction .",
    "in particular the two - dimensional system would seem to be a promising one to investigate .",
    "bayot et als@xcite disordered graphitic system showed weak localization effects whose magnitude was roughly 20% of the drude term in the electronic thermal conductivity at a temperature of @xmath66 .",
    "if it were possible to cleanly extract the phonon term , one could look at the electronic term as a function of both temperature and magnetic field , and distinguish weak localization and interaction effects .",
    "this would then experimentally settle the question of whether the wiedemann - franz law is violated in an interacting disordered system .",
    "another sensible quantity to investigate experimentally would be the thermal hall conductivity , which arises solely from electrons ( although there can be phonon drag effects ) . in future work",
    "we intend to derive the interaction corrections to this quantity .",
