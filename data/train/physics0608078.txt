    "rotational excitation of positive molecular ions is a major mechanism by which slow electrons lose energy in partially ionized molecular gas .",
    "the efficiency of this process is a significant parameter in various applications , for example the interpretation of dissociative recombination experiments @xcite or the determination of the density and temperature conditions in the diffuse interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "a good knowledge of rotational ( de)excitation cross sections is therefore required for a variety of molecular ions and over a wide range of collisional energies and rotational levels .",
    "in contrast to neutral molecules , however , little attention has been given to the electron - impact excitation of molecular ions .",
    "these are indeed more difficult to study experimentally and only a few theoretical treatments have been reported so far .",
    "the reference method for computing electron - impact excitation cross sections has been the coulomb - born ( cb ) approximation @xcite .",
    "this approach assumes that the collisional cross sections are entirely dominated by long - range interactions .",
    "the cb theory thus predicts that transitions with @xmath3=1 and 2 only are allowed for dipole and quadrupole interactions , respectively .",
    "recent _ ab initio _ @xmath1-matrix studies on several astronomically important molecular ions have shown , however , that this prediction is incorrect and that the inclusion of short - range interactions is crucial , particularly for ions with small ( or zero ) dipole or transitions with @xmath4 ( see , and references therein ) .",
    "these @xmath1-matrix studies were , however , hampered by the use of the adiabatic - nuclei - rotation ( anr ) approximation .",
    "the anr theory is expected to become invalid close to a rotational threshold because it neglects the rotational hamiltonian ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "this leads to an ambiguous interpretation of the anr energy because the electron energy in the exit channel of a near - threshold inelastic collision is very small while the assumption of rotational degeneracy sets this energy equal to that of the entrance channel . as a result , if the anr energy is interpreted ( as usual ) as the initial kinetic energy , then excitation cross sections are non - zero at and below threshold . in previous @xmath1-matrix works ,",
    "this artefact was corrected by multiplying the anr cross sections by the kinematic ratio @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the initial ( final ) momentum of the electron .",
    "this simple method , which forces the cross sections to zero at threshold , is widely used in the case of neutral molecules @xcite .",
    "the resulting cross sections , however , do not obey the proper threshold law , when the molecular target has a nonzero charge . in the present work , near threshold rotational excitation of h@xmath0 by electron - impact is investigated by comparing anr cross sections with independent calculations based on the quantum defect theory and rotational - frame - transformation ( mqdt - rft ) approach @xcite to our knowledge , this is the first quantitative assessment of the validity of the adiabatic approximation for electron - impact rotational excitation of a charged target molecule .",
    "the theoretical treatments are introduced in the next section .",
    "comparisons of cross sections obtained at different levels of theory are presented in section  3 .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section  4 .",
    "we consider the following process between an electron and a symmetric - top molecular ion : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ionic rotational angular momentum , @xmath10 and @xmath11 its projections along the body - fixed ( bf ) and the space - fixed ( sf ) axes , respectively , and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the initial ( final ) kinetic energy of the electron .",
    "the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath13 is : @xmath14 where the energy of the state ( jk ) is given in the rigid rotor approximation by : @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the rotational constants . it should be noted that vibrational energy splittings of h@xmath0 are much larger than rotational splittings , with the first excited vibrational level @xmath18 being 0.3  ev above the ground vibrational level @xmath19 . in the following",
    ", we will assume that the initial and final vibrational state of the ion is @xmath19 and that the incident electron energy is less than 0.3  ev .",
    "we follow the implementation of the anr theory for symmetric - top molecular ions as presented in .",
    "the key quantities in this approach are the @xmath20-matrix elements which are produced in the bf frame of reference and are then transformed through the conversion of the bf asymptotic scattering amplitude to the sf frame . in this approach ,",
    "the rotational hamiltonian is neglected and there is an ambiguity in defining the bf asymptotic electron energy , @xmath21 , which can be taken equal to the kinetic energy in the entrance ( @xmath12 ) or exit ( @xmath13 ) channels , or even to some other values ( see and references for neutral targets therein ) . the usual choice , however , is to take @xmath21 as the initial kinetic energy , @xmath12 . the integral anr rotationally inelastic cross section for a symmetric - top molecule",
    "is then given by @xcite : @xmath22 with @xmath23 where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the initial ( final ) electron orbital momentum , @xmath26 are the bf @xmath20-matrix elements belonging to the @xmath27th component of the @xmath28th irreducible representation ( ir ) of the molecular point group , with @xmath29 distinguishing between different elements with the same ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the @xmath31 coefficients are discussed , for example , in .",
    "the _ t_-matrix is as usually defined in terms of _ s_-matrix as @xmath32 and the cross section can be expressed in terms of the sf _",
    "s_-matrix by the familiar formula : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the total angular momentum .",
    "it should be noted that the ambiguous choice @xmath35 leads to excitation cross section that are non - zero below threshold .",
    "a common method for forcing the cross sections to zero at threshold is to multiply these by the ratio of the final and initial momentum of the electron , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this was used in particular in previous @xmath1-matrix works @xcite .",
    "however , the anr @xmath20-matrix elements still do not exhibit the proper dependence on @xmath7 in this limit , for an ionic target .",
    "alternatives such as @xmath36 are possible but still should not give the correct threshold laws for the @xmath20-matrix elements .",
    "furthermore , the principle of detailed balance is not rigorously satisfied near threshold .",
    "this will be further discussed in section  2.3 .",
    "the @xmath37+h@xmath0 bf @xmath20-matrices were taken from the @xmath1-matrix calculations of .",
    "the geometry of the ion was frozen at its equilibrium position corresponding to an equilateral triangle with d@xmath38 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath37+h@xmath0 scattering model was constructed using the four lowest target electronic states and the continuum orbitals were represented using the gto basis set given by which include all angular momentum up to @xmath39 and is optimized to span energies below 5  ryd .",
    "as discussed in , rotationally inelastic cross sections were found to be entirely dominated by low partial waves , with more than 90  % arising from @xmath40 , and anr cross sections were obviously unaltered by augmenting them with quadrupolar cb calculations for partial waves with @xmath41 .",
    "collisional selection rules are detailed in .",
    "we follow the implementation of the mqdt - rft theory as presented by kokoouline and greene ( 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "the @xmath37+h@xmath0 scattering model is based on _ ab initio _ h@xmath0 and h@xmath42 potentials independent from the @xmath1-matrix model presented above . in this framework , originally developed for the dissociative recombination of h@xmath0 , first , one constructs the energy - independent @xmath43-matrix in a basis better adapted for bf ( see kokoouline and greene ( 2003 , 2004 ) and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath43-matrix depends on the three internuclear coordinates @xmath44 and the projection @xmath45 of the electronic orbital momentum on the molecular axis .",
    "thus , we define the elements of the scattering matrix as @xmath46 the @xmath43-matrix in this representation is diagonal with respect to the rotational quantum numbers @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the whole molecule and the continuous coordinate @xmath44 . to completely define basis functions @xmath49 in the bf , in addition to @xmath45 and @xmath44 ,",
    "the rotational quantum numbers @xmath50 and @xmath51 must be also specified ; for brevity they are omitted in the above equation . for the matrix element @xmath52 we will also use the notation @xmath53 .",
    "the next step in the mqdt - rft is to obtain the @xmath54-matrix in the basis @xmath55 corresponding to the laboratory or sf coordinate system . in this basis ,",
    "the good quantum numbers are the vibrational quantum numbers ( for example , \\{@xmath56 } , if the normal mode approximation is used ) and rotational quantum numbers @xmath57 defined above . in the following",
    ", we will not specify any other conserved quantum numbers that are the same in the both bases , such as the total nuclear spin and the irreducible representation of the total wavefunction .",
    "the sf @xmath54-matrix is determined by carrying out a unitary transformation from the bf basis to the sf basis : @xmath58 where the summation indicates a sum over discrete indices and an integration over the continuous coordinates @xmath44 .",
    "the explicit form of the the unitary transformation matrix elements @xmath59 is given in eq.(27 ) of .    the transformation of eq .",
    "[ eq : rvft ] is truly unitary only if the vibrational basis in the sf representation is complete . in calculations",
    ", one always adopts a finite vibrational basis set that is not complete .",
    "it should be sufficiently large to represent properly the vibrational states contributing to the process of interest . in practice",
    "the vibrational basis set is calculated within a finite volume , and one can impose outgoing - wave ( siegert ) boundary conditions at its surface to account for the fact that some of the incident electron flux can be diverted through the collision into dissociative channels , as in and .",
    "the procedure of transformation from the bf to sf representations described above is called the rovibrational frame transformation in mqdt .",
    "it accounts for the coupling between electronic , rotational and vibrational motion of the molecule .",
    "in contrast to the mqdt - rft approach , the rotational dynamics of the system is not included in the anr .",
    "the unitary transformation of the @xmath54-matrix from the body frame to the laboratory frame , as described in the preceding paragraph , is similar in spirit to that described by chase ( 1956,1957 ) .",
    "but one important physical difference is that , whereas the chase approximation was intended to be applied only in energetically open collision channels , in the mqdt - rft the transformed scattering matrix @xmath54 includes ( weakly ) closed channels as well .",
    "when the incident electron collides with a singly - charged molecular ion of size @xmath60 , its kinetic energy is increased by @xmath61 , and consequently scattering into weakly - closed channels is often an important class of pathways , even for entrance or exit scattering processes that occur right at threshold with zero asymptotic kinetic energy .",
    "every such threshold has an infinite number of rydberg levels converging to it .",
    "for this reason , the transformed @xmath54 does not yet represent the physical scattering matrix @xcite .",
    "in fact , it represents the actual scattering matrix @xmath62 only in energy ranges where _ all _ of the channels @xmath55 are open for electron escape , i.e. where the total energy of the system is higher than the energy of the highest relevant ionization channel @xmath55 threshold .",
    "when at least one channel is closed , the physical scattering matrix @xmath62 is obtained from @xmath54 using the standard mqdt channel - elimination formula ( see eq . ( 2.50 ) in or eq .",
    "( 38 ) in ) .    in the h@xmath0 dr studies carried out by kokoouline and greene ( 2003 , 2004 ) ,",
    "the treatment has been limited to the dominant @xmath28-wave component ( @xmath24=1 ) of the incident electron wavefunction because the @xmath28-wave has the largest contribution into the dr cross - section .",
    "this partial wave also has the largest effect on the rotational excitation probabilities considered in the present study . when all channels @xmath55 are open for electron escape , the scattering matrix is energy - independent .",
    "( this is within the frequently - adopted approximation of energy - independent quantum defects , which can be improved upon when necessary , as has been discussed , e.g. , by . ) when there are closed channels that are coupled to open channels , the autoionizing rydberg series associated with the closed ionic channels introduce a strong energy dependence into the physical scattering matrix .",
    "consequently , the resulting cross - sections reflect these autoionizing resonance features that are strongly dependent on the energy .",
    "examples of such energy dependences that arise in electron collisions with h@xmath0 are demonstrated below .",
    "these rotational autoionizing resonances have been thoroughly studied in both experimental ( ) and theoretical ( , ) studies of h@xmath42 photoabsorption processes .",
    "mqdt - rft calculations including the complete rovibrational frame transformation and the jahn - teller effect have shown that the probability of rotational excitation @xmath63 is weakly energy - dependent in the region between the @xmath19 and @xmath18 vibrational levels @xcite .",
    "the rydberg resonances present in the rotational - excitation spectrum have in general small widths .",
    "however , for transitions involving symmetries with more than two rotational channels , the rotationally inelastic probabilities are actually nearly energy - independent only at electron energies above the highest channel ( all coupled rotational levels are open ) . for a 3-channel problem , there are thus an infinite number of purely rotational rydberg resonances at electron energies between the second and third channel thresholds .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  1 for the transition ( 1 , 1)@xmath64(2 , 1 ) at @xmath65 ( there is no @xmath28-wave rydberg series attached to ( 3 , 1 ) at @xmath66 ) .",
    "note that for the reverse process ( 2 , 1)@xmath64 ( 1 , 1 ) , all curves in fig .",
    "1 would be simply shifted towards zero electron - impact energy , in accordance with the detailed balance principle ( see section  2.3 ) .",
    "it can be seen in fig .  1 that the pure mqdt - rft calculation ( bottom panel ) is in very good agreement with the much more expensive rovibrational mqdt treatment ( top and middle panels ) .",
    "in the top panel , we observe the complicated structure introduced by the inclusion of the vibrational motion at energies above the ( 3 , 1 ) threshold . in this energy range , there are many narrow resonances corresponding to vibrationally excited states of bound h@xmath42 rydberg states . if one considers the integral over the resonance region , however , these resonances do not change the probability significantly .",
    "thus , as previously observed by for diatomic ions , a detailed treatment of vibrational motion is unnecessary to obtain reliable thermally - averaged rotational excitation rate coefficients of the type normally needed in astrophysical applications . on the other hand , in the region between the ( 2 , 1 ) and ( 3 , 1 ) channels ,",
    "rydberg resonances are found to increase the rotational probability by about a factor of 2 on average , i.e. , the value of 0.15 just above the ( 3 , 1 ) channel increases discontinuously to an averaged value of 0.29 .",
    "note that higher closed channels involving partial waves with @xmath67 are negligible .",
    "physically it means that incident electrons in partial waves with @xmath67 , for the energy range considered here , can not approach the ion closely enough to be able to excite it . from the mqdt point of view , it means that the quantum defects for molecular states with @xmath67 are close to zero . indeed , calculated cross sections for transitions with @xmath68 or @xmath69 are 3 to 4 orders of magnitude smaller than those with @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "resonances due to these low probability transitions do not therefore contribute significantly to the cross section . in the following",
    ", we will only consider 2- and 3-channel problems ( i.e. transitions with @xmath2 and 2 ) and two possible energy ranges : above and below the highest channel threshold .",
    "since we have restricted the frame transformation analysis in this paper to the purely rotational ft , the ionization channels in the energy - independent scattering matrix @xmath72 differ only in their rotational quantum numbers .",
    "the vibrational state is the same for all the channels , namely , the ground vibrational state of the ion .",
    "therefore , the integral over the vibrational coordinates @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rvft ] ) ( or in eq .",
    "( 27 ) of ) is the same for all the matrix elements @xmath72 .",
    "although the bf scattering matrix is not diagonal at all geometries in the bf rotational quantum number @xmath45 , the integral over the vibrational coordinates @xmath44 is not zero only when @xmath73 .",
    "this is because the non - diagonal elements of the bf matrix describe jahn - teller physics , which effectively couples only vibrational states belonging to different irreducible representations .",
    "therefore , the integrals over the vibrational coordinates of the ground vibrational state can be viewed as an effective diagonal @xmath74 or @xmath75 scattering matrix with elements @xmath76 , where @xmath77 represent the quantum defects averaged over the vibrational state .",
    "they are very close to the h@xmath42 born - oppenheimer quantum defects at the minimum of the h@xmath0 potential surface .",
    "the sf scattering matrix elements become in this approximation ( eq . (",
    "43 ) of ): @xmath78 in all calculations below we have used @xmath79=0.05 and @xmath80=0.39 for the @xmath28-wave quantum defects , as in .",
    "the above sf scattering matrix is energy independent and describes the electron - ion scattering only for energies above the highest ionization channel .",
    "the corresponding rotational probabilities for a set of symmetries and nuclear spins can be found in table  vi of .",
    "finally , the rotationally inelastic cross section is obtained as : @xmath81      the physical scattering matrix @xmath62 appropriate for this energy range is obtained from the matrix of eq .",
    "( [ eq : s3_smooth ] ) by the usual mqdt closed - channel elimination procedure @xcite . to simplify the formulae we omit here all indexes and superscripts other than 1,2 , and 3 .",
    "if channels 1 and 2 are open and channel 3 is closed the amplitude of the excitation @xmath84 is given by    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the ionization threshold energy of channel 3 .",
    "the @xmath87 excitation probability is given by @xmath88 and is shown in the lowest panel of fig .",
    "the probability depends strongly on the energy owing to the rydberg series of resonances attached to channel 3 .",
    "we have derived an analytical expression for the excitation probability @xmath89 averaged over energy in this region .",
    "since @xmath90 is a periodic function of @xmath91 , we average over just one period @xmath92 $ ] , i.e. over just one unit in the effective quantum number of the closed channel 3 :    @xmath93    we change this into a contour integral by making the variable change @xmath94 and we obtain the following form for @xmath89 : @xmath95 \\left[s^*_{2;1}(s^*_{3;3}-z)-s^*_{2;3}s^*_{3;1}\\right ] } { ( s_{3;3}-\\frac{1}{z})(s^*_{3;3}-z)}\\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this integral has two simple poles @xmath96 and @xmath97 inside the circle . the residue of the integrand at @xmath96 is @xmath98 and the residue at @xmath97 is @xmath99 once these are added , we see that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) can be simplified to give the average excitation probability in the energy range of rotational autoionizing states as @xmath100    we can notice that the above formula is consistent with the fact that rydberg resonances are important when @xmath101 is comparable in magnitude with @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the larger @xmath101 is , the larger are the resonances and their average contribution to the total excitation cross section .",
    "it should be also noted that the ratio @xmath104 is actually independent of the quantum defects and is entirely controlled by clebsch - gordan algebra . in the case of the ( 1",
    ", 1)@xmath64 ( 2 , 1 ) transition , @xmath1 is equal to 15/7 , leading to an analytically averaged value of @xmath105 , to be compared with the numerically - calculated average value of 0.29 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the present analytic approach is therefore estimated to be of the order of 10  % .",
    "finally , we note that the present analytical averaging can of course be applied to any sf @xmath54-matrices , in particular anr @xmath54-matrices that would have been converted to the sf frame of reference . in the following ,",
    "however , the averaging procedure will be implemented for mqdt - rft probabilities only .",
    "the principle of detailed balance , which is the consequence of the invariance of the interaction under time reversal , states that the transition probabilities @xmath106 and @xmath107 for a certain inelastic process @xmath108 and its reverse @xmath109 are equal _ at a given total energy , @xmath110 _ , defined as : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the electron kinetic energy and @xmath113 is the target internal energy . following this definition",
    ", cross sections must obey the formula : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the statistical weight of the state @xmath116 . at the mqdt - rft level of theory ,",
    "detailed balance is rigorously satisfied , even with the above averaging of probabilities over rydberg resonances",
    ". it should be noted , however , that this would not be the case for the averaged formulae presented above , if cross sections or rate coefficients were averaged over resonances instead of probabilities . at the anr level of theory",
    ", the assumption of target - state degeneracy leads to transition probabilities that are equal _ at a given kinetic energy_. as a result , anr cross sections obey the following formula : @xmath117 and eq .",
    "( [ det1 ] ) is generally not satisfied at the anr level .",
    "this problem again reflects the ambiguity in defining the bf asymptotic electron energy .",
    "in particular , if this energy is taken equal to the entrance electron energy for an excitation process and to the exit electron energy for the reverse deexcitation process , then eq .  ( [ det1 ] ) is rigorously satisfied at the anr level .",
    "moreover , when the transition probability is energy independent , as it is at the mqdt - rft level for energies above the highest channel , then cross sections obey both eqs .",
    "( [ det1 ] ) and ( [ det2 ] ) .",
    "this will be further discussed in the next section .",
    "rotationally inelastic cross sections are presented in figs .  2 and 3 for upward rotational transitions in _ ortho- _ and _ para- _ h@xmath0 . in fig .  2 ,",
    "the rovibrational mqdt result is compared to the mqdt - rft and anr calculations for the transition ( 1 , 1)@xmath118 ( 2 , 1 ) . note that the full mqdt - rovibrational and mqdt - rft results include contributions from @xmath119 and @xmath65 .",
    "we can first notice that the agreement between mqdt - rft and anr cross sections is extremely good above the highest ( 3 , 1 ) channel , with relative differences of less than 2  % . in this energy range ,",
    "we also notice in the full mqdt treatment a number of narrow resonances that correspond to vibrationally excited states of bound h@xmath42 rydberg states , as observed in fig .  1 for @xmath65 . between the ( 2 , 1 ) and ( 3 , 1 ) channels ,",
    "the anr cross section is found to significantly underestimate the averaged cross section owing to the appearance of large purely rotational rydberg resonances . in this energy range ,",
    "the mqdt - rft calculation includes the analytical averaging of probabilities over the rydberg series and it provides , as expected , a good averaged description of the full mqdt rovibrational result .",
    "we also notice that despite a large effect of resonances on the excitation probabilities for @xmath65 ( a factor of 2 , see fig .  1 ) , the resulting effect on the cross sections summed over @xmath120 is significantly lower , with an enhancement of about 30  % .",
    "this of course was expected since the dominant contribution to the cross section arises from a symmetry ( here @xmath119 ) with no purely rotational rydberg series .    below the energy of the lowest ionization channel ,",
    "the excitation cross section in any mqdt treatment is identically zero , or strictly speaking , the cross - section is not defined there because the electron can not be at infinity when all channels are closed .",
    "this behavior of the cross - section agrees with wigner s laws @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the anr excitation cross section follows the correct threshold law for an inelastic electron collision with a positive ion : @xmath121 this actually reflects the weak energy dependence of the anr @xmath20-matrix elements , in agreement with the mqdt - rft results ( see section  2.2 ) . as explained in section  2.1 , however , the anr cross sections are actually non - zero below threshold owing to our definition of the anr energy . in figs .  2 and 3 ,",
    "cross sections were therefore multiplied by the following heaviside step function : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the threshold energy .",
    "this ad - hoc correction is the simplest way of forcing the cross section to zero below threshold while keeping a finite value at threshold , in agreement with the above theoretical considerations .",
    "the effect of this heaviside correction can be checked carefully in transitions with no rotational rydberg series , that is , those with @xmath124 . in fig .  3",
    ", we can thus observe that all anr cross sections for transitions with @xmath125 are in excellent agreement with those obtained at the mqdt - rft level down to threshold .",
    "of course , the exception is the @xmath126 transition in which closed - channels effects occur at energies between the ( 3 , 1 ) and ( 4 , 1 ) channels and are of similar magnitude as in @xmath127 .",
    "note that we actually observe a slight increase of closed channel effects as the initial @xmath9 increases .",
    "rydberg resonances were thus found to enhance the @xmath128 cross section by about 45  % at energies between the ( 5 , 1 ) and ( 6 , 1 ) channels .",
    "the results presented in figs .  2 and 3 show that despite the important contribution of closed - channel effects in transitions with @xmath129 , the anr theory is generally quite successful in predicting rotational cross sections for molecular ions down to threshold .",
    "this result was actually predicted by , although the role of closed - channels was not considered by these authors . in their study , showed that the correction term to the adiabatic equation ( eq .  2.1 of their paper ) is of the order of the ratio of the electron mass @xmath130 to that of the nuclei @xmath11 .",
    "they concluded that the anr theory should be accurate down to an energy : @xmath131 that is , very close to threshold .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the same authors estimated that the lower limit in the case of neutral target molecules is much larger and is given by @xmath132 .",
    "this huge difference reflects the influence of the strong coulomb field in the case of ions .",
    "we finally note that the above heaviside correction does not of course correct for the breakdown of detailed balance within anr theory .",
    "as discussed in section  2.3 , a possible method to enforce detailed balance is to use a different definition of the anr energy for excitation and deexcitation processes .",
    "however , as the present anr @xmath20-matrix elements are nearly energy independent , detailed balance is actually almost satisfied at the anr level . for practical applications such as rate coefficient calculations",
    ", we still recommend computing cross sections and rates for the excitation processes ( including the heaviside correction ) and using the detailed balance relation for the reverse ones .",
    "near - threshold rotational excitation of h@xmath0 by electron - impact has been investigated by comparing anr cross sections with calculations based on the mqdt rotational - frame - transformation ( mqdt - rft ) method @xcite .",
    "very good agreement between anr and mqdt - rft cross sections is obtained for kinetic energies above the resonance regime caused by rotational closed - channels .",
    "these resonances occur for transitions with @xmath2 and @xmath71 and for these , an analytical formula for averaging transition probabilities over the resonance structure has been formulated .",
    "this averaging procedure is shown to significantly enhance probabilities and , to a lesser extent , cross sections . in the case of transitions with @xmath4 ,",
    "the anr theory is shown to be accurate down to threshold , provided a simple heaviside correction is applied to the excitation cross sections .",
    "an alternative but strictly equivalent solution is to interpret the anr energy as the exit kinetic electron energy and to compute deexcitation cross sections .",
    "some previous studies of the rotational excitation of molecular ions by electron collision , such as the h@xmath0 study by , applied the `` correction '' factor @xmath5 , designed for neutral targets by , in a manner that is not strictly correct .",
    "the resulting error in those results will be generally modest , nevertheless , except at energies very close to rotational thresholds .",
    "ideally , those results should be revised along the lines implied by the more detailed analysis of the present study , including the average effects of closed channel resonances where appropriate .",
    "but this is beyond the scope of the present article , so we do not present a comprehensive set of revised excitation rate coefficients here .",
    "moreover , the scattering matrices obtained in @xmath1-matrix calculations can be used even below closed - channel thresholds , provided they are sufficiently smooth functions of energy , and provided they are used in combination with mqdt closed - channel elimination formulas . the excellent agreement between r - matrix anr cross sections and the mqdt - rft results in figs .  2 and 3 provides supporting evidence for this point .",
    "this is also supported by the quantum defects as deduced from the @xmath1-matrix calculations ( using the diagonal bf @xmath20-matrix elements restricted to the @xmath28-wave channels ) : we obtain @xmath133=0.05 and @xmath134=0.37 , in very good agreement with the mqdt - rft values of , respectively , 0.05 and 0.39 ( see section  2.2.1 ) .",
    "the range of validity of the adiabatic theory is therefore much wider than the usual classically derived condition that the impacting electron energy be large compared to the threshold energy .",
    "moreover , it should be stressed that h@xmath0 is quite an unfavorable system for the anr theory owing to its large rotational spacings that make threshold and closed - channel effects important up to large kinetic energies ( @xmath135  ev ) . in particular , for astrophysical applications where inelastic rate coefficients are required down to @xmath13610@xmath137100  k @xcite , rydberg resonances will play a significant role .",
    "in contrast , for ions with rotational spacings smaller than typically 10  k , resonances will be of minor importance .",
    "finally , in the case of strongly polar ions ( @xmath1382  d ) such as hco@xmath139 , rotational excitation is completely dominated by ( dipolar ) transitions with @xmath2 ( see , e.g. ) . in this case , resonances due to the low probability transitions @xmath4 should not contribute significantly to the dipolar cross sections .",
    "high - partial waves ( @xmath67 ) are , however , required to converge dipolar cross sections ( i.e. , the use of bf @xmath20-matrix elements actually leads to a divergent cross section ) .",
    "it will be thus important to investigate in future works the influence of closed - channels on @xmath140- , @xmath141- and higher partial wave contributions to the cross section .",
