    "the best understood qcd system is perhaps the heavy quarkonium , made up of heavy quark and antiquark .",
    "known systems include charmonium , bottomonium , and @xmath3 mesons .",
    "we thought we understand these systems , but surprises often come up as more and more data become available .",
    "a well - known incident was the surplus of @xmath1 produced at high transverse momentum at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the color - singlet model @xcite missed the cross section by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the color - octet mechanism @xcite and subsequently the nonrelativistic qcd model @xcite were formulated to explain the surplus .",
    "recently , the belle collaboration observed double charmonium production , namely , @xmath0 at @xmath4 gev @xcite .",
    "the production rate is anomalous @xcite @xmath5 which is roughly an order of magnitude larger than any qcd predictions @xcite .",
    "it poses a strong threat to our understanding of quarkonium .",
    "however , one has to note that the @xmath1 is detected via its leptonic decay while @xmath6 is inferred from the recoil mass spectrum of the @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath6 is actually not identified , and perhaps it could be a @xmath1 , or something else . based on this argument , bodwin , lee , and braaten @xcite argued that belle in fact observed double @xmath1 s , which are produced via double virtual photons .",
    "however , the further analysis by belle does not seem to support this idea @xcite .",
    "thus , the anomalous production remains one of the challenging problems in qcd , and arouses speculations .",
    "for example , a heavy glueball of a mass very near @xmath7 with a rather large matrix amplitude has been proposed@xcite to account for the excess .    in this letter",
    ", we study a possible scenario of the existence of a light scalar boson @xmath8 , which has an enhanced coupling to the charm quarks .",
    "it contributes to both the @xmath9 production , and @xmath1 plus open charm pair production .",
    "we show the allowed parameter space region of the mass of this scalar and the coupling to charm , fitted to the belle data .",
    "we find that a coupling constant @xmath10 and @xmath11 gev can fit the data well .",
    "an immediate test for this light scalar boson is to look for a peak around 5 gev in the recoil mass spectrum of @xmath1 , because this scalar can also be produced directly in association with a @xmath1 .",
    "so far , the belle collaboration has only shown the recoil mass spectrum with very fine bin size up to 4 gev @xcite , where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 can be seen . however , the bin size in the region above 4 gev is too large",
    ". therefore , we urge the belle collaboration to scan with very fine steps in the region above 4 gev .",
    "( even with a large bin size , we notice that there may be something peculiar at around 5.25.4 gev bins @xcite . )",
    "finally , we point out that another process @xmath2 , which is negligible within the sm , becomes sizable in the our scenario .",
    "this is another interesting test for the scenario .",
    "suppose the interaction of the scalar boson @xmath8 with the charm - quark pair is given by @xmath15 with a coupling constant @xmath16 that will be determined later .",

    "[ fey-1],width=297 ]    one of the contributing feynman diagrams for @xmath22 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fey-1 ] .",
    "the sum of the amplitudes of the four contributing feynman diagrams for @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the polarization 4-vector of the @xmath1 , and @xmath26 is the square of the center - of - mass energy of the collision .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are the wavefunctions at the origin , with the normalization @xmath29 . here",
    "the center - of - mass energy @xmath30 of the collision is at @xmath31 gev , and so we simply only take the intermediate photon approximation ( the intermediate @xmath32 contribution is suppressed by @xmath33 . )    the angular distribution of the process is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 integrating the angle we obtain the total cross section @xmath36    let us examine the allowed parameter space of @xmath37 and @xmath16 that can fit the belle cross section . combining the systematic and statistical errors of the belle",
    "data the @xmath38 range is @xmath39 pb . we show the contours of the central value , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ psieta ] . taking @xmath42",
    "the allowed central value ( @xmath43 range ) for @xmath37 is @xmath44 here we used @xmath45 .     and @xmath46 bound for the @xmath47 plane due to the belle data of @xmath39 pb . [ psieta],width=326 ]    it is straightforward to adapt our scenario to explain other peaks in the recoil mass spectrum between @xmath48 gev , i.e , @xmath49 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "since our scenario only requires the @xmath37 at around @xmath50 , it would also explain the enhancement to the production of @xmath51 .",
    "note that our scenario would not give enhancement to @xmath52 because of the spin - parity - charge - conjugation of the photon propagator .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation by belle @xcite .",
    "note that if we choose a smaller @xmath16 , the corresponding central value @xmath37 of the fit to the belle data would become closer to @xmath53 gev , and the @xmath43 range would also become smaller , as shown in fig .",
    "[ psieta ] . the smaller the value of @xmath16 , the more fine - tuned value for @xmath37 that the fit gives .",
    "so in the following predictions of our scenario we simply take @xmath42 and the results just scale as some powers of @xmath16 .",
    "if we replace the scalar @xmath8 by a pseudoscalar boson @xmath54 , the diagram similar to fig .",
    "1 with @xmath8 replaced by @xmath54 gives vanishing amplitude in the static approximation .",
    "there is another diagram with the virtual @xmath54 bremsstrahlung off the charm quark turning into the @xmath6 state .",
    "however , such a contribution is important only when the mass @xmath55 is around @xmath56 gev , which is unfavorable based on the constraint of the belle search",
    ".    the static approximation of using the wavefunction at the origin may not be so valid when the higgs pole is involved , however our simple calculation serves the purpose of estimating of the size of the production rate due to the light higgs boson @xmath8 .",
    "this process is very similar to the original @xmath58 production , except that the @xmath17 pair does not form a bound state but goes into an open pair .",
    "they will hadronize into @xmath59 mesons .",
    "the calculation is straightforward , but however the result is not simple enough to be put here .",

    "the cross section scales as @xmath60 . at @xmath61 gev , @xmath62 pb for @xmath42 .",

    ". the value of @xmath42 is chosen .",

    "[ psih ] , we show the production cross section of @xmath70 with @xmath42 .",
    "the cross section scales as @xmath71 .",
    "the scalar boson @xmath8 so produced is heavy enough to decay into an open charm - quark pair .",
    "thus , it will give rise to open charm pair production , with the pair around 5 gev .",
    "if the belle could scan the recoil mass spectrum of @xmath1 further up to @xmath72 gev , they should be able to see if this scalar boson @xmath8 exists .",
    "this is the most immediate test for the scenario .",
    "vs @xmath37 .",
    "the value of @xmath42 is chosen .",
    "[ psih],width=326 ]",
    "in the sm , the leading contribution to the process @xmath2 comes from the one - loop diagrams with the @xmath73 boson and heavy fermions running in the loop . in our scenario with @xmath8 coupling strongly to charm ,",
    "this channel could be sizable for detection .",
    "the sm calculation was completed in ref .",
    "we use its formulas with the charm - quark contribution only , and modify the sm coupling to our enhanced coupling as follows : @xmath74 we show the ratio of @xmath75 at @xmath4 gev for @xmath76 gev with @xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ hgamma ] .",
    "the ratio scales as @xmath71 . note that with the sm coupling strength @xmath77 , this ratio is very small , of order @xmath78 . with the enhanced charm coupling ,",
    "the ratio is of order @xmath79 for @xmath80 gev .",
    "thus , the cross section of @xmath81 for @xmath80 gev at @xmath82 gev is about 40 fb , which will give thousands of events at belle or babar with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath83 .     at @xmath4 gev for @xmath76 gev .",
    "the scenario is @xmath42 .",
    "[ hgamma],width=326 ]",
    "one may concern about the high energy analog of @xmath84 production . in high energy collisions",
    ", we would expect extra @xmath85 in the final state , with one of the @xmath86 pairs clustering at around 5 gev . to our knowledge",
    "there have not been any measurement on four - charm production , nor any searches explicitly looking for anomalous four - charm events at lep or at the tevatron .",
    "there were perhaps some mysterious 4-jet events recorded by aleph @xcite , but it had no explicit identification of charm in those events .",
    "also , the search for four - charm events suffers severely from the weak charm identification , which is , to some extent , overlapped with the b - quark identification .",
    "therefore , there is no explicit constraints on four - charm production coming from high energy experiments .",
    "another possible source of constraints comes from upsilon @xmath87 decays . from the particle data book @xcite , the branching ratio @xmath88 .",
    "given such a large error it is impossible to rule out our scenario , because @xmath0 , @xmath89 , or @xmath90 open charm could only give a branching ratio below @xmath91 .",
    "there is also a limit on @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a pseudoscalar boson . in our scenario",
    ", we have a scalar boson and so the limit is not directly applicable .",
    "even so , @xmath94 would be very similar to @xmath95 ( from fig .",
    "[ hgamma ] ) without an explicit calculation .",
    "it implies @xmath96 , which is well below the existing limit that we stated above .",
    "the anomalous double charmonium @xmath58 production measured by belle posed a very strong challenge to our understanding of qcd .",
    "we have investigated the scenario of a light scalar boson of mass about @xmath97 gev with a large coupling ( of order the weak coupling or even larger ) to the charm quark .",
    "we found that it could explain the @xmath58 anomaly , and provided the much - needed @xmath1 plus open charm production .",
    "it would also explain the enhancement to the production of @xmath98 , but not to @xmath52 because of the spin - parity - charge - conjugation of the photon propagator .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation by belle .",

    "this is another test for the scenario .",
    "one may ask where this scalar boson comes from .",
    "such a light higgs may come from the general form of the multi - higgs doublet sector .",
    "the required enhanced coupling to the charm quark implies dedicated fine tuning .",
    "it also requires additional fine tuning to kill the unwanted flavor changing neutral processes .",
    "if we stay within the scope of the two - higgs doublet sectors with the quark couplings like those in the minimal supersymmetric standard model , the coupling strength of @xmath8 to charm is @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , in order to have an effective coupling @xmath100 we need a @xmath101 .",
    "such a large @xmath102 is unnatural and perhaps causes a big problem to the top yukawa coupling .",
