    "<S> such behavior has been successfully studied in many settings theoretically and experimentally , most notably in instances of quantum simulations in optical lattices @xcite .    by now , it is clear that , despite the unitary nature of quantum mechanical evolution , local expectation values equilibrate due to a dephasing between the eigenstates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far it is , however , unclear why this dephasing tends to happen so rapidly . </S>",

    "<S> this discrepancy poses the challenge of precisely identifying the equilibration time , which constitutes one of the main open questions in the field @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> what is more , only little is known about how exactly the equilibrium expectation values emerge . due to the exponentially many constants of motion present in quantum many - body systems , corresponding to the overlaps with the eigenvectors of the system , there seems to be no obvious reason why equilibrium values often only depend on few macroscopic properties such as temperature or particle number . in short </S>",

    "<S> this mechanism is much reminiscent of actual thermalization , in that an initially complex setting appears to converge to a high - entropy state that is defined by astoundingly few parameters only . in this way , we present a significant step forward in the theory of equilibration of quantum many - body systems that have been pushed out of equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our work suggests that for quadratic models , gaussification can be seen as a genuine mechanism of non - equilibrium dynamics , complementing and playing a significant role in equilibration .    </S>",
    "<S> our results hold for a remarkably large class of initial states , including ground states of interacting models evolving , after a so - called _ quench _ , in time under a quadratic fermionic hamiltonian with finite ranged interactions . </S>",
