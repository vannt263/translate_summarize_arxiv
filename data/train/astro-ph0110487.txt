    "since the first realisation that the cepheids are stars that pulsate radially , stellar oscillations have provided a fertile ground for astrophysicists .",
    "observations obtained with much improved sensitivity have provided a wealth of relevant data in recent years .",
    "this provides an important theoretical challenge given that the gathered information can be matched against detailed stellar models . with the likely advent of gravitational - wave astronomy in the next few years",
    ", relativists are considering whether a similar program may be feasible for compact stars .",
    "this is an exciting idea since the detection of gravitational waves from a pulsating star may shed light on the nature of the equation of state at supra - nuclear densities .",
    "although stellar oscillation theory has been an active field of research for many decades ( in particular in the context of newtonian gravity ) and there are several monographs covering the main results , many crucial questions remain open .",
    "the main uncertainties concern the behaviour in the non - linear regime , e.g. , the coupling between different modes , the formation of shocks etcetera .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate the accuracy of a new approach to the study of non - linear stellar oscillations .",
    "we apply the new method , in which the main focus is on non - linear deviations from the background stationary equilibrium star , to radial oscillations of neutron stars .",
    "this is a problem which , given its significance for the stability of the star , has received a lot of attention in the past . although most results have been obtained in the linear regime , and concern the nature of the various eigenmodes @xcite , there have also been attempts to study non - linear features in a perturbative way ( including quadratic and cubic coupling terms ) @xcite .",
    "[ it is also relevant to mention the recent application of this approach to non - linear effects on inertial modes @xcite as well as the fully nonlinear simulations by font , stergioulas and kokkotas . ]",
    "our new approach provides a powerful complement to these studies .",
    "we investigate the main features that appear in the weak to mildly non - linear regimes .",
    "this leads to some interesting new results regarding non - linear mode - coupling and sheds light on two of the main questions in this area : i ) what is the amplitude at which large amplitude modes saturate ?",
    ", and ii ) how reliable are expansion methods beyond quadratic order in the amplitude ? we believe our paper provides the first detailed study of these effects in full general relativity .",
    "we model the neutron star as a single component perfect fluid at zero temperature which obeys a polytropic equations of state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are constants .",
    "for such a fluid the energy momentum tensor is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the four velocity , normalised as @xmath5 .",
    "we restrict our consideration to spherical stars undergoing radial motions , in which case the four velocity is given by @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , in radial gauge and polar slicing the spherically symmetric line element is , @xmath7 i.e. it depends only on two functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 . with those assumptions the einstein field equations @xmath10 and the equations of hydrodynamics",

    "the solution of eqs.([nonp_lambdar])-([nonp_wt ] ) requires suitable boundary conditions . at the centre of the star we require that @xmath22 in order to avoid a conical singularity .",
    "the velocity @xmath21 vanishes at the origin due to spherical symmetry . at the stellar surface we fix the lapse function by matching the line element to an exterior schwarzschild metric which implies that @xmath23 .",
    "we use typical parameters for the neutron star model : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we set the central density of the equilibrium configuration of the neutron star to @xmath26 , which leads to a compactness ( mass / radius ratio ) @xmath27 .    in our analysis of non - linear mode coupling",
    "we approach radial oscillations of neutron stars satisfying equations ( [ nonp_lambdar])-([nonp_wt ] ) in the following manner .",
    "we decompose the time dependent quantities @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath28 into static background contributions and time dependent perturbations according to @xmath29 the background quantities are determined by the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations , the static analogues of eqs.([nonp_lambdar])-([nonp_wt ] ) .",
    "we use the background equations to eliminate all zero order terms from the resulting perturbative dynamic equations .",
    "the resultant equations are equivalent to the original system ( [ nonp_lambdar])-([nonp_wt ] ) . in particular , the two evolution equations form a quasilinear system for @xmath30 and @xmath21 . by eliminating terms of order zero in the perturbations",
    "we obtain numerical accuracy that is determined by the amplitude of the perturbation rather than the static background .",
    "this is the key advantage of this new approach .",
    "all preliminary tests have verified that this non - linear perturbation scheme provides much enhanced accuracy over a large range of amplitudes .",
    "full details of the new method as well as the numerical code and its calibration are provided by sperhake  .",
    "normally the surface of the star is defined by the vanishing of the pressure , which in the polytropic case is equivalent to @xmath31 . however ,",
    "if one is using an eulerian framework and the surface of the star is allowed to move , the outer grid boundary does not coincide with the surface of the star and this condition can not be applied easily . as has been discussed in detail by sperhake",
    "this leads to severe numerical difficulties , and could trigger artificial shock formation in the surface region . in the present study we want to focus on the non - linear coupling between various oscillation modes .",
    "in order to isolate this effect ( and avoid any artificial effects due to the surface of the star ) we use a fixed ( rather than free ) boundary condition , i.e. we require @xmath32 at the surface .",
    "furthermore we do not evolve the low density layers of the neutron star , in order to avoid negative total energy densities .",
    "the resulting neutron star model contains about 90 @xmath33 of the mass of the original model .",
    "the eigenmodes of a dynamic spherically symmetric neutron star are described by the linearised version of the dynamic equations ( [ nonp_lambdar])-([nonp_wt ] ) .",
    "it is a well known result that the linearised equations lead to a self adjoined eigenvalue problem in terms of the rescaled displacement vector @xmath34 , which is related to our variables by @xmath35 , cf . chapter  26 in misner , thorne and wheeler .",
    "the solutions of the eigenvalue problem form a complete orthonormal system and hence we can expand the time dependent @xmath36 resulting from fully non - linear evolution in a series of the linear eigenmodes @xmath37 where the coefficients @xmath38 are given in terms of the inner product @xmath39 in fig.[mod_eig ] we show the four lowest eigenmodes in the velocity field for our truncated stellar model .",
    "the expansion ( [ modesum ] ) provides a useful diagnostic which allows us to assess the level of non - linear coupling throughout a numerical evolution .",
    "we measure the presence of mode @xmath40 at any given time during the evolution by calculating the coefficient @xmath41 via numerical integration .",
    "in order to study non - linear mode - coupling we evolve the nonlinear perturbation equations from initial data corresponding to the velocity field @xmath42 of a single linear eigenmode ( of order @xmath43 ) with amplitude @xmath44 , which represents the maximum radial displacement of a fluid element inside the star .",
    "the initial density perturbation @xmath30 is set to zero , while the initial values for the metric variables follow from the constraints ( [ nonp_lambdar])-([nonp_mur ] ) .",
    "we first consider the case when the initial data correspond to the fundamental radial eigenmode .",
    "having evolved this data , we measure the maximal coefficients @xmath45 obtained over an integration time corresponding to many times the dynamical timescale . in fig.[square01 ] we show the maximal coefficients obtained for the lowest 10 eigenmodes for excitation amplitudes ranging between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we observe weak mode - coupling throughout most of this domain .",
    "the fundamental mode itself ( @xmath48 ) , is seen to grow more or less linearly with the initial amplitude @xmath49 , which indicates the absence of significant self interaction . meanwhile , for higher order modes we can clearly identify two different regimes : for amplitudes below @xmath50 , all coefficients @xmath51 grow quadratically with the excitation amplitude @xmath49 . at larger amplitudes all",
    "eigenmode coefficients except for @xmath52 show a transition to power laws with larger index .",
    "we have illustrated this behaviour in fig.[square01 ] by modelling the coefficients @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 as power series expansions in @xmath49 according to @xmath55 ( the einstein summation convention is not use here or in similar expressions below ) where @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "the higher order power laws have been obtained by least square fits to the coefficients @xmath38 after subtracting the quadratic contributions @xmath59 .",
    "for the modes @xmath60 the contribution of the higher order power law is rather weak which makes it difficult to obtain accurate measurements of the corresponding exponents .",
    "the steepening of the curves is , however , still obvious in the figure .",
    "it is also clear , since the curves for the eigenmode coefficients @xmath38 do not intersect in fig.[square01 ] , that the coupling strength decreases with the order of the eigenmodes over the whole range of amplitudes .",
    "next we set initial data in the form of second and higher eigenmodes . in this case",
    "we still observe the two regimes mentioned above . in the weakly non - linear regime",
    "the eigenmode coefficients are well approximated by quadratic power laws .",
    "the main difference from the previous case is that the second mode ( of order @xmath40 ) shows a preference to couple to modes of order @xmath61 .",
    "this is particularly clear in fig.[square02 ] where the coefficients @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 show a much steeper increase for large amplitudes . for these modes",
    "we also obtain excellent fits with combinations of power laws according to @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "these fits are shown in fig.[square02 ] .",
    "these results are generally confirmed if the initial data is given in the form of the third velocity mode .",
    "the only difference is that the preferred modes in the moderately non - linear regime are now those of order @xmath69 .",
    "in this paper we have applied a new non - linear approach to the study of stellar pulsation , and studied mode - coupling due to non - linear effects by evolving initial data corresponding to a single linear eigenmode with varying amplitude . concerning the transfer of energy to other modes we have found two distinct regimes , a weakly non - linear regime where the excitation of modes grows quadratically with the initial amplitude and a moderately non - linear regime ,",
    "which can be reasonably well described by power laws of higher order .    the results for the weakly non - linear regime agree qualitatively with newtonian perturbative studies .",
    "in the analytic study of non - linear mode coupling one normally views the eigenmode coefficients as harmonic oscillators and the non - linear interaction between eigenmodes is represented in the form of driving terms which are quadratic or of higher order in the amplitudes ( see for example van hoolst  ) @xmath70 where the @xmath71 , @xmath72 are the quadratic , cubic and higher order coupling coefficients and summation over @xmath73 is assumed . in our analysis",
    "the initial data consists of one isolated eigenmode @xmath43 , so that the right hand side can be approximated by @xmath74 in analytic studies this series expansion is normally truncated at second or third order .",
    "the omission of higher order terms is justified in the weakly non - linear regime , where our fully non - linear simulations confirm that quadratic terms in the initial amplitude dominate the coupling between eigenmodes .",
    "this is no longer true , however , in the moderately non - linear regime , where higher order terms are more important .",
    "our results allow us to define the transition to this regime , manifested by the breaks in the curves in figures  [ square01 ] and [ square02 ] .",
    "as is clear from the figures , the moderately non - linear regime corresponds to initial mode amplitudes above 10  m or so .",
    "we note that the corresponding mach number is of the order of 0.01 .",
    "this agrees well with investigations of newtonian stars ( kumar & goldreich 1989 ) which assume a mach number of 0.1 as the limit of applicability of semi - analytic mode coupling methods .",
    "furthermore , our results indicate that the non - linear couplings would be poorly captured by polynomial expansions in the mildly non - linear regime .",
    "we observe significant excitation of higher order modes ( eighth , tenth etc ) which can only emerge from very high - order couplings . to quantify the associated coupling coefficients in a perturbative calculation",
    "would be very difficult .",
    "we have also observed that , given an initial mode @xmath43 , the coupling to modes @xmath75 is particularly efficient in the moderately non - linear regime .",
    "this is naturally interpreted as a resonance effect . in analogy with the simple problem of a single forced oscillator we can assume that resonance occurs for any mode",
    "whose frequency is an integer multiple of the driving frequency @xmath76 in the general non - linear case , i.e. we can schematically write the eigenmode coefficients in the form @xmath77 where the @xmath78 will depend on the frequencies ( cf .",
    "eqs.(18 ) , ( 19 ) of van hoolst  . in our case",
    "the external force is provided by the non - linear coupling to the initial mode @xmath43 , as indicated in ( [ resonance ] ) .",
    "we therefore obtain resonance if @xmath79 . for our simple neutron star model ,",
    "the eigenfrequencies of radial neutron star oscillations are almost equally spaced and we can use @xmath80 for @xmath81 as a reasonable approximation .",
    "the condition for resonance then becomes @xmath82 which is exactly what we have observed .",
    "as one of the main results of this paper , we emphasise the new perturbative approach that enabled us to obtain highly accurate , fully non - linear , evolutions over a large range of amplitudes .",
    "this approach was discussed in detail by sperhake , and we plan to present further results regarding mode - coupling and non - linear shock formation in future papers . in principle , this technique can be applied to any physical problem that involves a non - trivial stationary limit and we expect it to prove a valuable tool in many non - linear problems .",
    "we note that the accuracy improvements are independent of the numerical discretization used ( here , second order , centred finite differences ) . in combination with methods suitable for smooth oscillatory solutions  @xcite , we would expect a dramatic expansion of the applicability of non - linear simulations to relativistic stellar pulsations .    a problem for which our new approach may prove useful concerns unstable modes of rotating neutron stars ( eg . the r - modes ,",
    "see andersson & kokkotas for a review ) .",
    "one of the most important questions raised in connection with the r - modes concerns the amplitude at which an unstable mode saturates .",
    "recently , direct three dimensional numerical simulations have been brought to bear on this problem @xcite .",
    "the picture that emerges from these studies is , however , not conclusive .",
    "both studies suggest that an unstable r - mode saturates at an extremely large amplitude ( corresponding to waves of a height of several hundred meters in a star spinning near the breakup limit ) due to shocks forming in the surface region . that such `` wave breaking '' would occur once a mode reaches a large amplitude is likely , but simulations must isolate the true physical behaviour near the surface of a star , from numerical artifacts associated with the rapid decrease in the density ( for a detailed discussion see sperhake ) .",
    "in fact , it is interesting to contrast these results with those of the present work that suggest that nonlinear effects are highly relevant already at wave amplitudes of order 10  m. we believe that a suitable generalisation of the method used in this paper , that provides unprecedented accuracy for a large range of wave amplitudes , could prove extremely useful for the study of unstable non - axisymmetric modes and plan to address such problems in the near future .",
