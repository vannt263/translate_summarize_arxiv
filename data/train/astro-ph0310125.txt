    "various cosmological probes have given strong evidence that a dark energy component , such as the cosmological constant , constitutes approximately @xmath5 of the total energy density of the universe .",
    "the most striking evidence comes from observations of supernovae in distant galaxies ( riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 , 2000 ) , mapping temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) sky ( e.g. , spergel et al . 2003 ) and detections of the integrated sachs - wolfe effect via the cross - correlation between the cmb and the large - scale structure ( boughn & crittenden 2003 ; nolta et al . 2003 ; scranton et al .",
    "if the dark energy is constant in time , its natural value is 50 to 120 orders of magnitudes larger than the observed value ( weinberg 1989 ) . a model that allows the dark energy to dynamically evolve could avoid this fine tuning problem ( see ratra & peebles 2003 for a review ) .",
    "such a dark energy model can be characterized by a time - dependent equation of state @xmath6 with @xmath7 ( the cosmological constant corresponds to @xmath8 ) .",
    "it is useful to treat this as a parameterization to be determined empirically , due to the lack of compelling models for the dark energy ( e.g. turner & white 1997 ) .",
    "the dynamically evolving dark energy affects the expansion rate of the universe , which in turn alters the redshift evolution of mass clustering .",
    "it is well established that weak lensing can directly map the mass distribution along the line of sight by measuring the correlated distortion of images of distant galaxies ( see mellier 1999 ; bartelmann & schneider 2001 for review ; and also see , e.g. , hamana et al .",

    "future wide - field multi - color surveys are expected to have photometric redshift information for distant galaxies beyond @xmath9 ( see e.g. massey et al .",
    "this additional information is extremely valuable in that it allows us to recover radial information on the lensing field , which probes the redshift evolution of the expansion history and mass clustering .",
    "since the weak lensing observables are predictable _ ab initio _ given a cosmological model , lensing tomography is a well - grounded means of constraining dark energy evolution ( hu 1999 , 2002a , b ; huterer 2002 ; futamase & yoshida 2001 ; abazajian & dodelson 2003 ; heavens 2003 ; refregier et al .",

    "while luminosity distance measures of supernovae are an established direct probe of dark energy ( e.g. , chiba & nakamura 2000 ; huterer & turner 2001 ; tegmark 2002 ; frieman et al . 2003 ; linder 2003 ) , it is important to perform cross checks of various methods to understand systematics and because they have sensitivities to different redshift ranges .",
    "non - linear gravitational clustering induces non - gaussianity in the weak lensing fields , even if the primordial fluctuations are gaussian .",
    "this non - gaussian signal thus provides additional information on structure formation models that can not be extracted by the widely used two - point statistics such as the power spectrum .",
    "the bispectrum , the fourier counterpart of the three - point correlation function , is the lowest - order statistical quantity to describe non - gaussianity .",
    "future wide - field surveys promise to measure the bispectrum of lensing fields at high significance , as will be shown here .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to determine the expected accuracy on cosmological parameters from tomography that jointly uses the lensing power spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "the lensing bispectrum or skewness have been applied for cosmological parameter estimation in previous studies ( hui 1999 ; benabed & bernardeau 2001 ; cooray & hu 2001a ; refregier et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "in this work , we use the lensing bispectra over all triangle configurations available from a given survey to compute the signal - to - noise for the bispectrum measurement .",
    "in addition , we use all the cross- and auto - bispectra constructed from the lensing fields in redshift bins . to do this",
    ", we correctly take into account the covariance in the analysis .",
    "we study all the parameters that the lensing power spectrum and bispectrum are sensitive to and present results for desired parameters with different marginalization schemes .",
    "we employ the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model to predict the lensing power spectrum and bispectrum for dark energy cosmologies .",
    "the parameter constraints derived thus depend on the model of mass clustering ( see jain & taylor 2003 and bernstein & jain 2003 for a model - independent method ) .",
    "hence , we derive the constraints on dark energy parameters marginalized over the other cosmological parameters on which the lensing observables depend . on angular scales below a degree , non - linear evolution leads to a significant enhancement of the bispectrum amplitude ( compared to perturbation theory ) , and is likely to amplify the dark energy dependences ( e.g. , hui 1999 ; ma et al .",
    "we employ an analytic fitting formula of the mass bispectrum given by scoccimarro & couchman ( 2001 ; see also scoccimarro & frieman 1999 ) to make model predictions of the lensing bispectrum . since the physics involved in weak lensing is only gravity , developing an accurate model of the non - linear bispectrum is achievable from @xmath10-body simulations , as has been done for the non - linear power spectrum ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter smith03 ) .",
    "in addition , tomography of the lensing bispectrum offers the possibility of constraining primordial non - gaussianity . while cmb observations so far have shown that the primordial fluctuations are close to gaussian ( e.g. , komatsu et al .",
    "2003 ) , it is still worth exploring primordial non - gaussianity from observations of large - scale structure at low redshifts , since the length scales probed by these two methods are different .",
    "exploring primordial non - gaussianity provides useful information on the physics involved in the early universe , such as particular inflation models ( e.g. , wang & kamionkowski 1998 ; verde et al . 1999 ; komatsu 2002 ; dvali et al . 2003 ; zaldarriaga 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "the lensing bispectrum due to primordial non - gaussianity has a different redshift evolution from that due to the non - gaussianity of structure formation and , in addition , their configuration dependences differ .",
    "hence , bispectrum tomography can be useful in separating these two contributions .",

    "we work in the context of spatially flat cold dark matter models for structure formation .",
    "the expansion history of the universe is given by the scale factor @xmath25 in a homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "the scale factor during the matter dominated epoch is determined by density contributions from non - relativistic matter density @xmath26 ( the cold dark matter plus the baryons ) and dark energy density @xmath27 at present , in units of the critical density @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the hubble parameter at present .",

    "dark energy that has negative pressure ( @xmath40 as observed today ) leads to repulsive gravity , and therefore does not cluster significantly .",
    "however , dark energy does affect the growth of mass clustering through its effect on the expansion rate .",
    "in linear theory , all fourier modes of the mass density perturbation , @xmath41 , grow at the same rate : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the growth factor normalized as @xmath44 and , in the following , the tilde symbol is used to denote the fourier component .",
    "the growth factor can be computed by solving the linearized differential equation , @xmath45 , where the dot is the derivative with respect to physical time .",
    "hence , the growth suppression rate ( growth rate relative to that in a flat , matter - dominated universe ) , @xmath46 , can be obtained by solving the differential equation ( e.g. , wang & steinhardt 1998 ) : @xmath47 \\frac{dg}{d\\ln a}+3\\left[1-w(a)\\right]\\omega_{\\rm de}(a)g(a)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the dark energy density parameter at epoch @xmath36 .",
    "we employ the initial conditions of @xmath49 and @xmath50 at @xmath51 , which is valid for the dark energy models we consider . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a spatially smooth dark energy component ( its spatial fluctuations matter on length scales comparable with the present - day horizon scale , which are not probed by weak lensing surveys of interest ) .",
    "for example , @xmath52 for dark energy cosmologies are shown in figure 2 of linder & jenkins ( 2003 ) .    in this paper",
    "we mainly employ the @xmath23 normalization for the input linear mass power spectrum , equivalent to setting @xmath44 today . in this case",
    ", increasing @xmath53 from @xmath8 or equivalently increasing the dark energy contribution at @xmath54 leads to slower redshift evolution of the growth rate , since structure formation freezes at higher redshift ; for example @xmath55 for @xmath54 .",

    "therefore , external information on these parameters from other methods such as observations of cmb , supernovae and galaxy redshift surveys is valuable in that it allows us to break the degeneracies .",
    "this is investigated in figure [ fig : lenscmb ] , which shows how the constraint ellipses in the subspace of ( @xmath20 , @xmath283 , @xmath284 ) change when we combine the constraints from lensing tomography and cmb . to compute the fisher matrix from measurements of the cmb temperature and polarization power spectra and the cross spectrum",
    ", we assumed the experimental specifications of the planck 143 and 217  ghz channels with @xmath322 sky coverage and assumed a spatially flat universe , no massive neutrinos , no running tilt and no gravity waves .",
    "however , we include the dependence of the dark energy equation of state , which modifies the cmb power spectra through the change of the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface ( we ignored its spatial fluctuations ) .    in this case ,",
    "the cmb power spectra are specified by 8 parameters ( @xmath20 , @xmath283 , @xmath284 , @xmath323 , @xmath21 , @xmath285 , @xmath22 , @xmath324 ) and have been computed using cmbfast version 4.5 ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) .",
    "@xmath323 is the amplitude of the primordial curvature fluctuation and @xmath324 denotes the optical depth ( their fiducial values are taken to be @xmath325 and @xmath326 ) . likewise , to compute the fisher matrix from lensing tomography , we employed the @xmath323 normalization of the mass power spectrum instead of the @xmath23 normalization for the consistency .",
    "figure [ fig : lenscmb ] shows that combining the constraints from cmb measurements and lensing tomography significantly improves the dark energy constraints , yielding @xmath327 , @xmath328 and @xmath329 .",
    "note that the results shown are derived by adding the two @xmath330 fisher matrices from lensing tomography and the cmb spectra , including the marginalization over the optical depth .",
    "it is also worth noting that the cmb measurements can better constrain the other parameters @xmath331 than lensing tomography , which is part of the reason for the improvement in figure [ fig : lenscmb ] .",
    "figure [ fig : chiovwwa ] shows forecasts of the dark energy constraints expected from the snap survey of type ia supernova measurement ( e. linder , private communication ) and its lensing survey .",
    "we assumed the sky coverage @xmath332 for the snap weak lensing survey ( see massey et al .",
    "2003 ; refregier et al .",
    "it is again apparent that a joint analysis of weak lensing and supernovae significantly improves the parameter errors due to their complementarity : the errors become @xmath333 , @xmath334 and @xmath335 .",
    "moreover , this result can be further improved by combining with the cmb constraints , which gives ( for @xmath336 ) : @xmath337 and @xmath308 .",
    "next we examine how lensing observations can probe the running spectral index of primordial scalar perturbations , motivated from the wmap result ( spergel et al .",
    "cmb measurements probe large length scale fluctuations and the constraint on the running spectral index is to some extent diluted by the other parameter uncertainties ( especially the optical depth @xmath324 ) .",
    "in fact , strong constraints on the running of the spectral index can be obtained only by combining cmb , galaxy surveys and the ly-@xmath338 forest .",
    "weak lensing directly probes the relevant small length scales , and is not susceptible to uncertainties due to biasing .",
    "the measured spectra however have undergone nonlinear evolution , so an accurate model is needed to infer the shape of the linear spectrum .",
    "= 13.cm    to make forecasts for future lensing surveys , we follow the model in spergel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , where the linear mass power spectrum is expressed as @xmath339 where @xmath340 and @xmath341 mpc@xmath342 and @xmath161 is the transfer function .",
    "figure [ fig : chidns ] shows the forecast constraints on @xmath283 , @xmath284 and @xmath343 , for the two redshift bins .",
    "here we considered 8 parameters in the fisher matrix analysis ( @xmath343 , plus the seven parameters we have used so far ) , which enlarges the constraint ellipses in figure [ fig : chins2 ] .",
    "it is clear that lensing tomography can put stringent constraints on the running spectral index : @xmath344 .",
    "this result can be compared with the constraint @xmath345 expected from the planck mission ( see table 2 in eisenstein et al .",
    "1999 ) and with the constraints expected from galaxy redshift surveys ( @xmath346 ) and the ly-@xmath338 forest ( @xmath347 in mandelbaum et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the model ( [ eqn : runns ] ) differs in these papers , which affects the @xmath310-@xmath311 error . ] for this parameter the bispectrum is especially powerful , as evident from figure [ fig : chidns ] .",
    "we have used lensing tomography with the power spectrum and bispectrum as a probe of dark energy evolution and the mass power spectrum .",
    "the lensing bispectrum has different dependences on the lensing weight function and the growth rate of mass clustering from those of the power spectrum .",
    "thus bispectrum tomography provides complementary constraints on cosmological parameters to power spectrum tomography . by using information from different triangle configurations and all cross - spectra in redshift bins",
    "we find that the bispectrum has roughly as much information as the power spectrum on parameters of interest ( see figures [ fig : chins2 ] and [ fig : chins3 ] ) .",
    "parameter accuracies are typically improved by a factor of @xmath1 if both the power spectrum and bispectrum are used , compared to the standard approach of using just the power spectrum ( see table 1 ) .",
    "thus our study provides strong motivation for the use of the bispectrum from lensing surveys for parameter extraction .    since lensing observables",
    "are significantly affected by non - linear gravitational clustering on angular scales below a degree , we used a non - linear model ( see discussion below ) to compute the lensing bispectrum and to estimate the precision on the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath20 , @xmath283 , @xmath284 and @xmath343 .",
    "the constraints on the dark energy parameters are @xmath348 and @xmath4  this sensitivity to the redshift evolution of the equation of state of dark energy is comparable to the best methods proposed for the coming decade .",
    "moreover , external information on dark energy parameters such as provided by cmb and type ia supernova measurements can significantly improve the parameter accuracies as shown in figures [ fig : lenscmb ] and [ fig : chiovwwa ] .",
    "in addition , lensing tomography can precisely probe the mass power spectrum : the constraint on the power spectrum amplitude is @xmath349 , and on the running spectral @xmath350 .",
    "our analysis includes the full information at the two- and three - point level . using three - point statistics such as the skewness , which contain no information on triangle configurations , weakens parameter constraints significantly .",
    "thus there is strong motivation to build an accurate model of lensing observables in the moderately non - linear regime .",
    "this should be feasible , since the physics involved in lensing is only gravity .",
    "it will also be necessary to calibrate the covariance of the bispectrum over relevant triangle configurations using a sufficient number of simulation realizations .",
    "such an accurate model of the lensing bispectrum might modify the ellipse shapes in figure [ fig : chins2 ] .",
    "even so , we believe that the level of improvement from bispectrum tomography is likely to be correct , because the mass bispectrum we have employed should correctly estimate the amplitude , and therefore the signal - to - noise to within @xmath312-@xmath351 .",
    "we also estimate how bispectrum tomography can put constraints on primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "the most optimal constraint was estimated by requiring that the bispectrum due to primordial non - gaussianity is detectable with @xmath233 .",
    "we neglected the bispectrum induced by gravitational non - gaussianity , since it differs in its redshift evolution and configuration dependence .",
    "however , even with this assumption , the result in figure [ fig : fnl ] is not very promising : the constraint on the primordial non - gaussian model is not as stringent as that from the cmb bispectrum measurement ( komatsu et al .",
    "2003 ) , unless an almost all - sky lensing survey is available .",
    "it is worth exploring how the three - dimensional mass reconstruction proposed by hu & keeton ( 2003 ) could allow us to improve the lensing estimates .",
    "we have concentrated on statistical measures of the convergence . however , the convergence field is not a direct observable , and reconstructing the convergence field from the measured ellipticities ( shear ) of galaxies is still challenging from survey data .",
    "reconstruction techniques have been proposed for the power spectrum and the convergence field from realistic data ( see kaiser 1998 ; hu & white 2001 for the 2d case and taylor 2003 and hu & keeton 2003 for 3d mass reconstruction ) . it is of interest to develop an optimal method of extracting the lensing bispectrum from the measured shear field .",
    "alternatively , we can use measurements of the three - point correlation functions of the shear fields , which have been extensively studied recently by schneider & lombardi ( 2003 ) , zaldarriaga & scoccimarro ( 2003 ) and tj03a , c ( see bernardeau , mellier & van waerbeke 2003 ; pen et al . 2003 ; jarvis , bernstein & jain 2003 for measurements ) .",
    "the shear three - point correlation functions carry full information on the convergence bispectrum ( schneider , kilbinger & lombardi 2003 ) . therefore , all the results derived in this paper are attainable using tomography of the two- and three - point functions of the shear fields .",
    "there are other uncertainties we have ignored in this paper .",
    "we have assumed accurate photometric redshift measurements . for finite errors in the redshifts , we can not take narrow redshift subdivisions of the galaxy distribution .",
    "this error would lead to additional statistical errors on measurements of the power spectrum and bispectrum and in turn on the cosmological parameters .",
    "since we use only two or three redshift bins in our analysis , the demands on statistical errors are not very stringent . however ,",
    "possible biases in the photometric redshifts must be carefully examined , because the redshift evolution of dark energy leads to only a small effect on the lensing observables , as discussed in bernstein & jain ( 2003 ) .",
    "we have also ignored the @xmath200-mode contamination to the lensing observables , though it is seen in current measurements ( e.g. , jarvis et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the main source is likely to be observational systematics which are not eliminated in the psf correction . for a shallow survey",
    ", the intrinsic ellipticity alignments could also provide significant contribution to the @xmath200-mode on small angular scales .",
    "another useful application of photometric redshift information is that it allows us to remove intrinsic alignment contaminations by excluding close pairs of galaxies in the same redshift bin ( heymans & heavens 2003 ; king & schneider 2003 ) .",
    "thus the cross - power spectrum calculated from different redshift bins is not affected by the intrinsic alignment .",
    "hence , lensing tomography that uses the cross - power spectra and bispectra is robust to systematics ( takada & white 2003 ) . the degradation in parameter accuracies is likely to be small , because the cross - power spectrum carries comparable lensing signal to the auto - spectrum ( see figure [ fig : cl ] and takada & white 2003 ) .",
