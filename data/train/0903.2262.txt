    "the demography of local galaxies suggests the that almost every galaxy hosts a quiescent super - massive black hole ( mbh ) at the present time and the properties of the mbh are correlated with those of the host . in particular , recent observational evidence points to the existence of a strong correlation between the mass of the central mbh and the velocity dispersion of the host spheroid ( tremaine et al .",

    "it is currently unclear if these correlations hold at higher redshift , or if the scalings evolve with cosmic time .",
    "these correlations strongly suggest co - eval growth of the mbh and the stellar component via likely regulation of the gas supply in galactic nuclei ( silk & rees 1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; fabian 2002 ; king 2003 ; thompson , quataert & murray 2005 ; natarajan & treister 2009 ) .    the current phenomenological approach to understanding the assembly of mbhs involves data from both high and low redshifts .",
    "these data are used to construct a consistent picture that is in consonance with the larger framework of the growth and evolution of structure in the universe ( for example : haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 ; haiman & loeb 1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; 2002 ; wyithe & loeb 2002 ; volonteri et al .",

    "2006 ; peng 2007 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2007a , b ) and it also appears that these correlations are possibly linear projections of a more universal mbh fundamental plane relation ( hopkins et al .",
    "the observed correlations offer insight into how the dynamics of the merger process establish these relations .    in a companion paper ( volonteri , lodato & natarajan 2007 ) we explored the evolution of mbhs with cosmic history starting from physically motivated mbh formation models .",
    "we investigated the observational signatures by following the mass assembly of these black hole seeds to the present time .",
    "we showed that the low - redshift population evolved from physically motivated seeds agrees nicely with current constraints ( mass function of mbhs at @xmath6 ; the integrated mass density of black holes and the luminosity function of agn as a function of redshift ) .    in this paper , we address the establishment of the correlation between mbh masses and the velocity dispersion of their host , by focusing on two relevant questions as we track the journey of black holes onto the observed @xmath7 @xmath8 relation , ( i ) are the correlations established independently of galaxy mass , and ( ii ) can observations at @xmath9 select samples unbiased with respect to the @xmath2 relation .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows : in the first and second sections we outline very briefly the basic methodology adopted to track the merger history , in the third section , we focus on the details of the @xmath2 relation and its establishment with epoch and mass ( in section 4 ) .",
    "the observational consequences of our model are described in section 5 and our conclusions are discussed in the final section of this paper .",
    "we ground our models in the framework of the standard paradigm for the growth of structure in a @xmath10cdm universe  a model that has independent validation , most recently from _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) _ measurements of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( spergel et al .",

    "structure formation is tracked in cosmic time by keeping a census of the number of collapsed dark matter haloes of a given mass that form ; these provide the sites for harboring mbhs .",
    "the computation of the mass function of dark matter haloes is done using the extended press - schechter theory ( lacey & cole 1993 ) and monte - carlo realizations of merger trees ( volonteri et al .",
    "monte - carlo merger trees are created for present day haloes and propagated back in time to a redshift of @xmath11 20 . with the merging history thus determined , the haloes",
    "are then populated with seed mbhs . the halo merger sequence is followed and black holes are grown embedded in their dark matter halo .",
    "we compare two distinct types of seeds : ` light seeds ' , derived from population iii remnants , and ` heavy seeds ' , where we plant the initial seeds in the dark matter haloes according to the prescription described in volonteri , lodato & natarajan ( 2007 ) as per the physically motivated model developed by lodato & natarajan ( 2007 ; 2006 ) .",
    "in the ` heavy seeds ' scenario , massive seeds with @xmath12 can form at high redshift ( @xmath13 ) , when the intergalactic medium has not been significantly enriched by metals @xcite . here",
    "we refer to @xcite , for more details of the seeding model , wherein the development of non - axisymmetric spiral structures drives mass infall and accumulation in a pre - galactic disc with primordial composition .",

    "@xmath17 is the maximum halo spin parameter for which the disc is gravitationally unstable , @xmath18 is the gas fraction that participates in the infall and @xmath19 is the toomre parameter .",
    "the efficiency of mbh formation is strongly dependent on the toomre parameter @xmath20 , which sets the frequency of formation , and consequently the number density of mbh seeds .",
    "guided by our earlier investigation , we set @xmath21 ( the intermediate efficiency model ) as described in volonteri , lodato & natarajan ( 2007 ) .",
    "the efficiency of the seed assembly process ceases at large halo masses , where the disc undergoes fragmentation instead .",
    "this occurs when the virial temperature exceeds a critical value @xmath22 , given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a dimensionless parameter measuring the critical gravitational torque above which the disc fragments @xcite .",

    "the main features of a scenario for the hierarchical assembly of mbhs left over by the first stars in a @xmath10cdm cosmology have been discussed by volonteri , haardt , & madau ( 2003 ) and volonteri & rees 2006 .",

    "an accretion episode is assumed to occur as a consequence of every major merger ( mass ratio larger than 1:10 ) event .",
    "each mbh accretes an amount of mass , @xmath58 , that corresponds to 90% of the @xmath59 relation of its host halo ( ferrarese et al .",
    "this choice allows us to take into account the contribution of mergers .",
    "if a mbh increases its mass beyond the @xmath3 relation , we shut its growth . during this phase a mbh",
    "would be classified as an agn .",
    "the rate at which mass is accreted scales with the eddington rate for the mbh , and is based on the results of galaxy merger simulations , which also heuristically track accretion onto a central mbh ( di matteo et al .",
    "2005 ; hopkins et al .",
    "we impose a lower limit to the eddington ratio of @xmath60 .",
    "accretion starts after a dynamical timescale and lasts until the mbh has accreted @xmath61 .",
    "the lifetime of agn therefore depends on how much mass it accretes in each episode : @xmath62 where @xmath63 ; @xmath64 is the radiative efficiency ( which depends with the mbh spin , @xmath65 , assuming coherent accretion , berti & volonteri 2008 ) and @xmath66 gyr .",
    "the farther away a mbh is from the @xmath3 , the longer it shines before accretion is shut when it reaches the @xmath3 limit .    in this scheme",

    "recent numerical relativity simulations suggest that merging mbh binaries might be subject to a large ` gravitational recoil ' : a general - relativistic effect due to the non - zero net linear momentum carried away by gravitational waves in the coalescence of two unequal mbhs ( fitchett 1982 ; redmount & rees 1992 ) .",
    "radiation recoil is a strong field effect that depends on the lack of symmetry in the system , and for merging mbhs with high spin in particular orbital configurations , the recoil velocity can be as high as a few thousands of kilometers per second .",
    "we include the effects of gravitational recoil by adopting the fitting formula proposed by lousto & zlochower ( 2008 , see also baker et al .",
    "mbhs that are displaced from galaxy centres by the gravitational recoil effect produce a population of _ wandering _ mbhs and agns as explored in earlier work ( volonteri & perna 2005 , volonteri & madau 2008 , devecchi et al .",
    "we present the results of tracking the assembly history of mbhs in 2 classes of galaxies , ( i ) a dark matter halo with mass @xmath67 that hosts a mw type galaxy and ( ii ) a more massive dark matter halo , @xmath68 , that hosts a massive early type ( et ) galaxy .",

    "these baseline results are _ independent of the seeding mechanism_. in the ` heavy seeds ' scenario , most of the mbh seeds start out _ well above _ the @xmath6 @xmath3 , that is , they are ` overmassive ' compared to the local relation .",

    "the mass function instead peaks at @xmath37 ( lodato & natarajan 2007 ) . as time elapses ,",
    "all haloes are bound to grow in mass by mergers .",
    "the lowest mass haloes , though , experience mostly minor mergers , that do not trigger accretion episodes , and hence do not grow the mbh . the evolution of these systems can be described by a shift towards the right of the @xmath3 relation : @xmath1 increases , but @xmath0 stays roughly constant .",
    "such systems are clearly seen at @xmath75 in fig .",

    "effectively , for the lowest mass haloes growth of the galaxy and the central mbh are not coeval but rather sequential .    in the case of population iii seeds",
    "as well there is initially no correlation between seed mass and halo mass or velocity dispersion .",
    "here we have assumed that the seeds form in the mass range @xmath49 .",
    "the initial @xmath3 relation would therefore appear as a horizontal line at @xmath78 ( shown at the bottom of fig .",

    "biased peaks in the halo mass distribution , which are the sites for the formation of the largest galaxies , host the earliest massive mbhs that fall on the relation .",
    "hence , the @xmath3 correlation is established first for mbhs hosted in the largest haloes present at any time .",
    "mbhs in small galaxies lag behind , as their hosts are subject to little or no major merger activity . in many cases",
    "the mbhs remain at the original seed mass for billions of years ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the @xmath75 panel ) .",
    "we find that these conclusions hold irrespective of our initial seeding mechanism and the relation tightens considerably from @xmath70 to @xmath84 , especially for mbhs hosted in haloes with @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "we find that if black hole seeds are massive , @xmath87 , the low - mass end of the @xmath3 flattens at low masses towards an asymptotic value , creating a characteristic ` plume ' .",
    "this ` plume ' consists of ungrown seeds , that merely continue to track the peak of the seed mass function at @xmath88 down to late times . for the population iii seed case ,",
    "since the initial seed mass is very small , the plume of mbhs with @xmath89 in haloes with @xmath90 disappears .",
    "we track mbh assembly histories with a view to understanding two kinds of observations , observations of actively accreting mbhs as probed by _ flux limited agn surveys _ and potential observations of _ gravitational waves emitted by merging mbhs_. note that in our model not every galaxy merger causes a merger of mbhs as one of the two galaxies might not be seeded .",
    "if the halo mass ratio is 1:10 or higher , every galaxy merger ( where at least one of the galaxy hosts a mbh ) triggers accretion and therefore such cases will be detected as an agn .",
    "agns are therefore more common than mbh mergers , in our scheme .      since it is during accretion episodes that mbhs move onto the @xmath2 relation , agn are better tracers of the correlation itself , and worse tracers of the original seeds .",
    "differences between seeding models appear only at the low  mass end .",
    "we predict the existence of many low luminosity accretors with masses off the relation at @xmath70 down to @xmath91 .",
    "these ` outliers ' are mostly objects with @xmath92 , making them rather faint sources .",
    "for instance , for an eddington ratio of 0.1 , this black hole mass corresponds to an x  ray luminosity in the [ 2 - 10 ] kev band of @xmath93 erg s@xmath81 , or b - band luminosity @xmath94 erg s@xmath81 . at @xmath95",
    "these luminosities correspond to fluxes of order a few times 10@xmath80 erg s@xmath81 @xmath82 ( as a reference , the chandra deep field north has a flux limit @xmath96 erg s@xmath81 @xmath82 ) .",

    "we note that the seed scenarios are less distinguishable for active mbhs than for the case of quiescent mbhs ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the massive end of m - sigma , as traced by agn , is well populated at @xmath40 and @xmath95 and its only at @xmath97 that lower masses get on to the relation .",
    "the figure also shows that within the mass range probed by current flux - limited survey seed formation models are indistinguishable .",
    "the ` outliers ' off the @xmath2 , with @xmath92 , are currently not easily observable , but future , planned x - ray missions with higher sensitivity might uncover this population . since mbhs move on to the @xmath3 relation starting from the most massive systems at any time , the implication of our result is that flux limited agn surveys tend to be biased toward finding mbhs that preferentially fall and anchor the @xmath2 relation .",
    "flux limited surveys indeed preferentially select the most massive accreting mbhs residing in the most massive galaxies ( lauer et al .",

    "when we track the merging population , we find that mbh - mbh mergers also preferentially sample the region of space where mbhs lie on the @xmath3 relation .",

    ", one typically sits on the @xmath3 relation , while the companion tends to be less massive , hence , when they merge , the remnant finds itself in the right spot on the @xmath3 relation ( solid circles ) .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated how the @xmath3 relation is populated at the earliest times for models with physically motivated initial black hole seeds . starting with ab - initio mbh seed mass functions computed in the context of ` heavy seeds ' ( direct formation of central objects from the collapse of pre - galactic discs in high redshift haloes ) , or ` light seeds ' ( population iii remnants ) we follow the assembly history to late times using a monte - carlo merger tree approach . _ the initial seeding does not set up the @xmath101 relation . _ in our calculation of the evolution and build - up of mass we assume a simple prescription for determining the precise mass gain by the mbh during a merger . motivated by the phenomenological scaling of @xmath102 , we assume that this proportionality carries over to the gas mass accreted in each step .",
    "this simple assumption allows us to meet a number of observational constraints , including the luminosity function of quasars and the mass density in mbhs at @xmath6 ( volonteri et al .",
    "2008 ) .    here follows a summary of our results .",
    "* we find that the @xmath2 relation can be established early due to accretion episodes associated with major mergers even though the original mbh seeds themselves do not satisfy this relation .",
    "* at the high mass end ( @xmath103 ) , the relation is anchored early , and low mass mbhs slowly migrate onto it as hierarchical merging proceeds . * among active accretors ,",
    "the most massive mbhs ( @xmath103 ) sit on or around the @xmath3 relation at all epochs and consequently flux limited agn surveys are biased to preferentially detect this population .",
    "* similarly , we find that lisa is also likely to be biased toward detecting black holes that preferentially inhabit the @xmath51 relation .",
    "this bias is due to major mergers being more common at high redshift for the most massive , biased , galaxies .    _",
    "since we assume a priori that the accreted mass during a major merger event scales as the fifth power of the velocity dispersion , we inevitably recover the observed @xmath7 slope_. our current formalism therefore does not equip us strictly speaking to study the evolution of the relation or the scatter with redshift .",
    "however , the exact scaling of the accreted mass does not affect our results , as long as accretion is merger - driven and it establishes a clear correlation between hole and host . to push this scenario",
    "further , we have implemented a model where the @xmath3 correlation evolves with redshift as proposed by woo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , based on observations of @xmath104 agn .",
    "we have simply assigned to mbhs hosted in galaxies experiencing a major merger a mass corresponding to the extrapolation at all redshifts of the scaling suggested by woo et al .",
    ": at fixed velocity dispersion @xmath105 .",
    "this is the final mass that a mbh would have at the end of the accretion episode .",
    "this relation has been proposed for @xmath104 objects .",
    "we applied the same scaling all the way to high redshift , further imposing that the mbh mass is not larger than the galaxy mass .",
    "implementing such rapid evolution we find overproduces the local mbh mass density and overestimates the luminosity function of quasars , while the main conclusions of the present paper are otherwise unchanged .    as a further check of our result that the establishment of the @xmath2 is a function of the halo bias and hierarchy ,",
    "we have tested a model where _ the accreted mass does not correlate with the velocity dispersion at all . _ for this scenario , we assume a prescription for black hole growth , simply that mbhs _ double _ in mass at every major merger with no implemented self - regulation prescription .",
    "this model allows us to explore the effect of the number of major mergers on mbh growth ( i.e. , the connection with the cosmic bias ) .",
    "although the resulting @xmath3 has a larger scatter at all redshifts and the local mbh mass density and luminosity function of quasars are overestimated ; we still recover a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in the sense that the most massive galaxies do tend to host the most massive holes .",
    "since in this case there is no correlation between accreted mass and halo properties , this exercise confirms that the existence of this correlation is a pure reflection of the merger history : the most massive halos experience a larger number of major mergers over their lifetime , hence their mbhs are the first to grow , and become the largest .",
    "the slope of the @xmath3 correlation is however much flatter than the local empirical correlation ranging from 2 ( for massive seeds ) to 3.4 ( for population iii seeds ) instead of @xmath106 .",
    "we note here that the scatter obtained in the @xmath3 at @xmath7 in all the models studied here reflects both the seeding mechanism ( the spread in seed masses ) and the prescription used for self - regulation .",
    "one of our key predictions is the existence of a large population of low mass ` hidden ' mbhs at high redshift which are undetectable by flux limited agn surveys and at merger by lisa , that at later times likely end up as wandering mbhs .",
    "this population of low mass black holes are outliers at all epochs on the @xmath2 relation .",
    "outliers can be detected as imri / emri gravitational waves events , or via stellar dynamical @xmath0 measurements in low  mass galaxies .",
    "we find that nuclear mbhs with masses in excess of @xmath107 preferentially lie on the @xmath3 correlation .",
    "more accurate measurements of mbh masses below @xmath107 will enable us to use the measured @xmath7 relation to constrain seeding models at high redshift since cosmic evolution does not appear to smear out this imprint of the initial conditions .",
    "the scatter in the observed @xmath3 relation might also provide insights into the initial seeding mechanism . since population iii remnants do not appear to be efficient seeds ( alvarez et al .",
    "2009 ) , other channels like the one proposed by lodato & natarajan , for instance , are clearly needed to make massive seeds .",
    "it appears that the local relation might indeed hold clues to initial seeding mechanism .",
