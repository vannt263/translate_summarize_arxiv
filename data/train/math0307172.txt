    "in order to construct , in a systematic way , examples of _ finite quantum groups _ , g.  kac developed in @xcite a method to obtain non - trivial ( i.e.non-commutative and non - cocommutative ) quantum groups as _ extensions _ of a finite group by a finite group dual .",
    "such an extension of a finite group @xmath0 with the dual of a finite group @xmath1 is described by the following data :    * a large group @xmath2 such that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are subgroups of @xmath2 satisfying @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( we say that @xmath5 is a _ matched pair _ ) , * a compatible pair of _ @xmath6-cocycles _ ( see equations below ) .",
    "two extensions are isomorphic if and only if the the matched pairs are the same and the pairs of @xmath6-cocycles are cohomologous . as such",
    ", there appears a natural cohomology group associated with a matched pair .",
    "g.  kac found in @xcite an _ exact sequence _ which permits to calculate this cohomology group in terms of the usual cohomology groups of @xmath7 and @xmath2 with coefficients in @xmath8 , the group of complex numbers of modulus @xmath9 .",
    "the above theory of extensions has been generalized to the framework of locally compact quantum groups ( in the sense of kustermans and the third author @xcite ) by vainerman and the third author @xcite : extensions in the category of locally compact quantum groups are exactly described using matched pairs with cocycles . again , there appears a natural cohomology group .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study this cohomology group , to prove a version of the kac exact sequence in a locally compact setting and to compute the cohomology in concrete examples . as such",
    ", we shall provide a precise explanation for the calculations in @xcite .    given a matched pair of locally compact groups ( see definition [ def.matched ] ) , the first two authors introduced in @xcite an alternative notion of cocycles and hence , another cohomology group .",
    "an awkward , but straightforward calculation yields that both cohomology groups agree for matched pairs of discrete ( and in particular , finite ) groups .",
    "below , we will use a more elegant approach that permits to conclude that both cohomologies agree for the most general matched pairs of locally compact groups .",
    "after the fundamental work of kac @xcite , matched pairs of locally compact groups have been studied by majid @xcite in order to construct examples of kac algebras .",
    "his definition of a matched pair of locally compact groups @xmath5 requires that @xmath3 and that the multiplication map @xmath10 is a homeomorphism onto @xmath2 .",
    "the first two authors @xcite gave a more general definition , allowing @xmath11 to be an open subset of @xmath2 with complement of measure zero .",
    "using such a matched pair , they constructed a multiplicative unitary , given by a pentagonal transformation .",
    "the most general definition of a matched pair has been introduced in @xcite by vainerman and the third author and in @xcite by the authors , requiring only that @xmath3 and that @xmath11 has a complement of measure zero .",
    "we remark here that examples of such matched pairs , with @xmath11 having empty interior , were given in @xcite and used to construct examples of locally compact quantum groups with remarkable topological properties .",
    "we mention that algebraic work on matched pairs and kac cohomology for hopf algebras and lie algebras has been done in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , all locally compact spaces will be supposed _ second countable_. we denote by @xmath8 the group of complex numbers of modulus @xmath9 , which we will often write additively through the identification with @xmath12 .",
    "[ def.matched ] we call @xmath5 a _ matched pair _ of locally compact groups if @xmath7 are closed subgroups of the locally compact group @xmath2 such that @xmath13 and @xmath14 has haar measure zero .    given a matched pair @xmath5 of locally compact groups , we define , almost everywhere on @xmath2 , @xmath15    we will deal with cohomology theories with coefficients in polish @xmath2-modules",

    "whenever @xmath50 is a free resolution of the polish @xmath2-module @xmath17 , the measurable cohomology @xmath26 is the cohomology of the complex @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the @xmath2-fixed points of @xmath48 . again , as above , if we have two free resolutions of @xmath17 : @xmath53 and if we are given continuous @xmath2-equivariant homomorphisms @xmath54 intertwining the two free resolutions , then these homomorphisms induce a cohomology isomorphism .    in section [ sec.computational ] , we explain the methods developed by d.  wigner to compute the measurable cohomology @xmath26 in certain cases .",
    "the kac @xmath6-cohomology appears in two natural ways . in both pictures ,",
    "it is at first somehow awkward to write the cocycle relations .",
    "we will see below , how a much more natural way of writing these relations can be obtained .",

    "we make the following choice that will be useful later : @xmath616 an explicit generator for @xmath597 is then given by @xmath617    we turn next to @xmath618 .",

    "using the subgroups @xmath620 and @xmath552 , we have a matched pair and hence , we have the bicomplex in equation to compute the measurable cohomology @xmath26 .",

    "we conclude that @xmath641 is an isomorphism .",
    "hence , the group of extensions is @xmath642 . in @xcite , proposition 6.3 , explicit pairs of @xmath6-cocycles @xmath643 have been constructed for the matched pair @xmath5 . using remark [ rem.inverse ] and the final formula on page 171 as well as the first formula on page 172 of @xcite",

    "once one is able to perform such a calculation , one can see as well how to change the function @xmath647 in @xcite in order to get exactly the whole of @xmath253 .",
    "next , consider the matched pair with @xmath648 considering the maximal compact subgroup @xmath649 , we get immediately that @xmath641 is an isomorphism .",
    "the explicit cocycles @xmath644 found in @xcite are mapped to @xmath650 under this isomorphism .",
    "again , it is not hard to find then explicit formulas for cocycles giving exactly the whole of @xmath253 .",
    "finally , we look at the matched pair @xmath651 from the kac exact sequence , it follows that the sequence @xmath652 is exact .",
    "since @xmath653 is an isomorphism , we get @xmath654 .",
    "this explains why it is impossible in @xcite to exponentiate the cocycles from the lie algebra to the lie group level .    in the final matched pair above",

    "so , we conclude as above that @xmath253 is isomorphic to the group of lie bialgebra extensions , i.e.  @xmath585 as stated in proposition 6.2 of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be a semi - simple lie group with finite center , such that in its iwasawa decomposition @xmath660 , @xmath552 is a maximal compact subgroup .",

    "since @xmath1 is contractible , we get that @xmath663 and @xmath664 is an isomorphism for all @xmath665 .",
    "it follows from the kac exact sequence that @xmath666 for @xmath244 .",
    "hence , @xmath667 is an isomorphism .",

    "moreover , @xmath669 for @xmath244 .",
    "writing @xmath670 for the lie algebra of @xmath1 and @xmath671 for the lie algebra of @xmath552 , it follows that the group of extensions is isomorphic with @xmath672 if we take @xmath673 , we immediately get that the group of extensions is trivial . for @xmath674 ,",
    "a direct calculation gives @xmath675 , while @xmath676 .",
