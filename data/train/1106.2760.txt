    "the axial - vector ( av ) charmed mesons @xmath0  and @xmath2  @xcite have the puzzling feature that their decay widths are much smaller than one would expect on the basis of their principal @xmath10-wave decay modes .",
    "namely , the @xmath0  decays to @xmath11 ( possibly also in a @xmath12 wave ) , with a phase space of more than 270 mev , but has a total width of only 2025 mev @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath2  decays to @xmath13 in @xmath10 and @xmath12 wave with a phase space of about 30 mev , resulting in an unknown tiny width @xmath14 mev , limited by the experimental resolution @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the missing two av charmed mesons , namely the very narrow @xmath3  and the very broad @xmath1 , first observed by cleo @xcite and belle @xcite , respectively , completed an even more confusing picture .",
    "while the tiny width of the @xmath3  can be easily understood , since this meson lies underneath its lowest okubo - zweig - iizuka  allowed ( ozia ) and isospin - conserving decay threshold , the huge @xmath1  width , in @xmath11 , is in sharp contrast with that of the @xmath0 . moreover ,",
    "the @xmath3  lies 76 mev below the @xmath2 , whereas the @xmath0  and @xmath1  are almost degenerate in mass , if one takes the central value of the latter resonance .",
    "quark potential models , with standard spin - orbit splittings , fail dramatically in reproducing this pattern of masses . for instance",
    ", in the relativized quark model @xcite the @xmath7 state that is mainly @xmath8  comes out at 2.57 gev , assuming the already then well - established @xmath2  to be mostly @xmath9 , though with a very large mixing between @xmath8  and @xmath9 .",
    "reference @xcite similarly predicted a too high mass for the dominantly @xmath8state in the @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) sector , viz . 2.49  gev . in the chiral quark model for heavy - light systems of ref .",
    "@xcite , the result for the mainly @xmath8@xmath5 state is also 2.49  gev , while the discrepancy is even worse in the @xmath7 sector , with a prediction of 2.605  gev for the mostly @xmath8  state , now with a small mixing in both sectors .    more recently and after the discovery of the @xmath3  ( and @xmath1 ) , chiral lagrangians for heavy - light systems ( see e.g.refs .",
    "@xcite ) have been employed in order to understand the masses of the av charmed mesons , in particular the mass splittings with respect to the vector ( v ) mesons with charm @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "reference  @xcite analyzed in detail the curious experimental @xcite observation that the av - v mass difference is considerably larger in the charm - nonstrange sector than in the charm - strange one , which is not predicted by typical quark potential models @xcite .",
    "the same discrepancy applies to the scalar - pseudoscalar mass difference in either sector @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the problem was tackled by calculating chiral loop corrections , but the result turned out to be exactly the opposite of what is needed to remove or alleviate the discrepancy .",
    "an alternative approach to the av charmed mesons is by trying to generate them as dynamical resonances in chiral unitary theory @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the latter paper , describing av mesons in other flavor sectors as well , several charmed resonances were predicted , including the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , with reasonable results , though the @xmath5 states came out about 100 mev off .",
    "however , dynamical generation of mesonic resonances , including the ones that are commonly thought to be of a normal quark - antiquark type , may give rise to interpretational difficulties , besides predicting several genuinely exotic and so far unobserved states @xcite .",
    "dynamically generated av charmed as well as bottom mesons can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , too .    finally , in ref .",
    "@xcite a coupled - channel calculation of positive - parity @xmath7 and @xmath17 was carried out in a chiral quark model , similar to our approach in its philosophy , and with results for the @xmath2  and @xmath3close to the present ones ( also see below ) .",
    "in the present paper , we employ the resonance - spectrum expansion ( rse ) to describe the av charmed mesons .",
    "the rse model has been developed for meson - meson ( mm ) scattering in non - exotic channels , whereby the intermediate state is described via an infinite tower of @xmath18-channel @xmath19 states @xcite .",
    "for the spectrum of the latter , in principle any confinement potential can be employed , but in practical applications , a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) with constant frequency has been used , with excellent results @xcite .",
    "recent applications of the rse concern the @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite resonances .    in order to account for the two possible spectroscopic channels",
    "@xmath8  and @xmath9contributing to a @xmath4 state with undefined @xmath22-parity , we couple both @xmath19 channels to the most important meson - meson channels .",
    "the resulting fully off - energy - shell rse @xmath23 matrix reads @xcite @xmath24^{-1 } \\right\\}_{\\!mj}{j^{j}_{l_{j}}}(p'_jr_0)\\,\\sqrt{\\mu_jp'_jr_0 } \\ ; , \\label{tmat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the diagonal loop function @xmath25 and the rse propagator @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is an overall coupling , @xmath28 is the average distance for decay via @xmath29  quark - pair creation , @xmath30 is the discrete energy of the @xmath31-th recurrence in the @xmath19 channel with spin @xmath10 , @xmath32 is the corresponding coupling to the @xmath33-th mm channel , @xmath34 the reduced mass for this channel , @xmath35 the off - shell relative momentum , @xmath36 the orbital angular momentum , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 the spherical bessel and hankel functions of the first kind , respectively . note that @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and the on - energy - shell relative momentum @xmath39 are defined relativistically . also notice that the infinite sum over the higher recurrences converges very fast , so that it can be truncated after 20 terms in practical calculations .",
    "the @xmath10 matrix is finally given by @xmath40 .",
    "now we describe the physical av charmed resonances by coupling bare @xmath8  and @xmath9  @xmath5 , @xmath7 channels to all ozi - allowed ground - state pseudoscalar - vector ( pv ) and vector - vector ( vv ) channels .",
    "it is true that there are also relevant    .included meson - meson channels for @xmath0  and @xmath1 , with ground - state couplings squared @xcite , orbital angular momenta , and thresholds in mev . for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , a pseudoscalar mixing angle of @xmath43 @xcite",
