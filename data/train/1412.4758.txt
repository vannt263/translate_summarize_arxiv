    "a new dimension has been literally opened for the control and manipulation of light with `` _ _ polarization shaping _ _ ''  @xcite .",
    "this makes the most out of the vectorial nature of light by determining its time evolution not only in phase and amplitude but also in its state of polarization .",
    "since the interaction of light and matter is polarization sensitive , the control of this additional degree of freedom has allowed to outbeat the performances of light in most of its usual applications , such as photon ionization  @xcite , sub - wavelength localization  @xcite or timing with zeptosecond precision  @xcite .",
    "proposals abound as to its future applications in both a classical and quantum context  @xcite . beyond the extension of the concept of pulse shaping to encompass polarization ,",
    "there has been as well increasing demand for time - independent but spatially varying polarization beams  @xcite such as cylindrical vector beams  @xcite . when providing all the states of polarization to realize so - called `` _ _ full poincar beams _",
    "@xcite , these also demonstrate advantages in similar endeavors , such as boosted scattering or sub - wavelength localization  @xcite .",
    "they also allow direct industrial applications in laser micro - processing , such as improving the efficiency and quality of processes like drilling holes for fuel - injection nozzles  @xcite , processing of silicon wafers  @xcite or the machining of medical stent devices  @xcite .",
    "a new chapter of optics with fundamental as well as applied benefits has therefore been started with the availability of beams with a nontrivial dynamics of polarization .    here",
    "we show that semiconductor microcavities  @xcite in the strong exciton - photon coupling regime  @xcite offer a convenient and powerful platform to bring together these two twists on polarized light , by providing full poincar beams in time .",
    "this is implemented in a largely self - contained integrated device of micrometer size which does not rely on extrinsic processing of the signal . as such",
    ", this considerably improves on the unwieldy complexity of the setups required to generate polarization shaping and full poincar beams independently , that both come with their respective limitations . indeed ,",
    "since conventional solid state lasers typically emit light with a fixed linear polarization  @xcite , and optical nano - antennas also generally radiate a fixed polarization determined by their geometrical structure  @xcite , the synthesizing of a desired polarization in space  @xcite or time  @xcite is an involved process .",
    "time varying polarization is particularly demanding as it requires a combination of liquid crystals , spatial light modulators , interferometers and computer ressources with construction algorithms as well as state of the art pulse - shaping techniques , that all together make up a complex setup and impose some restrictions , such as the duration of the pulse  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics in our experiment takes place in a femtosecond timescale , as in many pulse shaping counteparts , but unlike these cases , it has no intrinsic restriction to a particular timescale and turning to other systems with rabi frequencies of different magnitudes , the same dynamics can be realized with today s technology in timeranges that run from attoseconds ( with plexitons  @xcite ) to milliseconds ( with nanomechanical oscillators  @xcite ) .",
    "our scheme also offers a tunable and undemanding control of which area to span on the poincar sphere and can be realized with any polarized fields that supports strong coupling , not only light .",
    "these results should allow to disseminate the usage of time - dependent polarization beams in a wide variety of platforms , including its extension to the quantum regime by powering the mechanism with quantum rabi oscillations .    ) , resulting in an oscillating intensity ( purple line ) of constant polarization ( yellow line ) , and ii ) in two polarizations , reversing the pattern of oscillations .",

    "( c ) spatial distributions of the density and polarization at time intervals during one of the initial cycles after the second pulse arrival .",
    "as can be seen while the emitted intensity remains basically constant ( height scale in c ) the resulting polarization is strongly affected by the rabi oscillations ( mutual oscillations in b and polarization map in c ) .",
    "the polarization can also be made homogeneous or not spatially . ]",
    "the effect is based on the superposition of coherent states of different polarizations in the regime of rabi oscillations  @xcite . in some basis ,",

    "we will call @xmath15 the relative optical phase between the two photon fields at @xmath16 , and @xmath17 that between the exciton fields , which will play an important role and which , in the experiment will be controlled by the time delay between the exciting pulses . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tuenov18161354cet2014 ] ) , it is apparent that the exciton field is needed only as an initial condition .",

    "figure  [ fig:1](a ) shows a simple illustration of this polarized rabi dynamics in the left - right circular polarization basis . the intermittent transfer of light to the exciton field through rabi oscillations results in a temporary switch - off of the cavity emission in the corresponding polarization .",
    "by synchronizing them so that the cavity always emits in some polarization , one obtains a signal of constant intensity but of oscillating polarization defined by their superposition , which describes a circle on the poincar sphere during one period of oscillations ( shown as a green trace in fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the period , given by the polariton splitting , is roughly equal to in our case .",
    "the circle is defined on the sphere , in a given basis ( we will work in the circular one ) , by two couples of angles @xmath45 , defined by the ratios of polarization @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the photon  @xmath5 and exciton  @xmath6 fields at @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the relation follows straightforwardly by geometric construction as :    [ eq : minov26153758cet2014 ] @xmath48    for  @xmath49 , @xmath6 .",

    "[ fig:2](a ) , where the case @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 is shown . in the particular case where @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the circle reduces to a point , i.e. , to a constant polarization .",
    "this case corresponds to choices of  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 that define a polariton , i.e. , an eigenstate of the system with no temporal dynamics .",
    "the polarization of light is then fixed to that of the corresponding polariton .",
    "we can now take advantage of a feature that is usually regarded as a shortcoming of microcavity polaritons , but that in our case will turn the simple effect just proposed into a mechanism that powers a new type of light .",
    "there is a significant lifetime imbalance of the two types of polaritons  @xcite , with the upper polariton @xmath55where @xmath56being much more short - lived as compared to the lower polariton @xmath57where @xmath58regardless of the polarizations  @xmath59 .",
    "the upper polariton lifetime is typically of the order of while the lower polariton lifetime is of the order of .",
    "these values can however be tuned by orders of magnitude with the already existing technology  @xcite .",

    "this latter is further divided into twin pulses of equal @xmath60 linear polarizations , of which , only one , upon double passage onto a @xmath61 plate , becomes @xmath62 linear . after rejoining their paths ,",
    "the twins are made counter - circular ( by use of a second @xmath61 plate ) .",
    "their mutual delay can be set on a rabi period scale ( @xmath63 ) and wavelength order ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "sample emission is then filtered in polarization and let to interfere with the reference on the camera , before digital elaboration . ]    the overall dynamics of polarization is therefore that which starts by describing the circle of the rabi dynamics in absence of dissipation , with a continuous drift towards the fixed point of polarization of the lower polariton .",
    "the final state can be parametrized in the same way with a couple of angles @xmath65 , by making a rotation of the polariton basis .",
    "this introduces the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 from which one obtains the angles @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( cf .",

    "the exact trajectory is obtained by including decay in the dynamics of the coupled fields .",

    "[ fig:2 ] . in all cases , green arrows point at the initial states and the red one at the fixed point of the asymptotic final state .",

    "second , by varying the rabi period , which can be achieved by tuning the coupling strength , or the decay rates , one can vary the number of loops around the sphere .",
    "to implement these effects in the laboratory , we used a gaas polariton microcavity in the regime of rabi oscillations described in previous works  @xcite .",

    "the pulses are initially linearly polarized and subsequently passed through quarter wavelength plates to make them counter - circularly polarized .",
    "the energy spread of the pulses overlaps with both polariton branches and thus triggers rabi oscillations between excitons and photons . after the 1st pulse ,",
    "the lower and upper polaritons have the same circular polarization .",
    "after the 2nd pulse , the dynamics of polarization is triggered according to the principle of eq .",
    "( [ eq : juejun5211819cest2014 ] ) . by weighting adequately the two branches and by adjusting the optical phase between the two pulses",
    ", we are able to realize various cases of interest predicted by the theory .",
    "some typical experimental observations are shown in fig .",

    "the points are experimental data and the lines are theory fits with the model presented above but supplemented with the dynamics of excitation by femtosecond polarized pulses .",
    "while all polarizations are measured experimentally , only two polarizations are needed by the theory to obtain the other ones .",
    "we have checked the consistency of the model and the observation by fitting polarizations in all bases and by their reconstruction from one basis only .",
    "experimentally , only the photonic field is accessible , but the theory allows to reach the exciton field as well .",
    "therefore , we are able to reconstruct the polarization dynamics , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( d , i ) , and ( e , j ) with a 3d ( 2d+time ) representation of the polarization . the effective quantum state can also be reconstructed  @xcite . the dynamics is more clearly visualized on the poincar sphere .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows how the beam of light emitted by the microcavity provides an ultra - fast sweeping of , in these cases , a hemisphere of the poincar sphere , and with two speeds of relaxation similarly to the cases of the theoretical model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](d ) . in all cases ,",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is excellent .",
    "in the literature , a variety of multiple polarized beams are implemented by setting space profiles with different polarization .",
    "a noticeable example is that of radial ( hedgehog ) or azimuthal polarization field states realizable , e.g. , by use of q - plate devices  @xcite . here , we have used essentially spatially homogeneous profiles in the experiments , as seen in the time - space chart in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b , c ) , to focus on the time dynamics instead .",
    "nevertheless , a spatially dependent polarization could also be combined with the temporal dynamics we have highlighted .",
    "one of the easiest space patternings would consist of sending the second pulse with a slight angle of incidence ( i.e. , a @xmath88 ) with respect to the first one . in this case , while co - polarized beams would give interference fringes of amplitude , rabi - oscillating in time ( hence moving with a @xmath89 velocity ) , in the case of counter - polarized beams , all the dynamics discussed in the present work could be obtained with an associated phase delay between the fringes .",
    "each fringe could be made time - oscillating in polarization and with a phase offset with respect to each other , giving rise to a flow of polarization waves with rabi time period and settable space period , the whole drifting towards the fixed polarization state of the lp polariton .",
