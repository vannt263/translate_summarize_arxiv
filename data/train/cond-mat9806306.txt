    "<S> we consider the repulsive hubbard model on a square lattice with an additional term , @xmath0 , which depends upon the square of a single - particle nearest - neighbor hopping . at half - band </S>",
    "<S> filling , constant @xmath0 , we show that enhancing @xmath1 drives the system from a @xmath2-wave superconductor to an antiferromagnetic mott insulator . at zero temperature in the superconducting phase , </S>",
    "<S> spin - spin correlations follow a powerlaw : @xmath3 is in the range @xmath4 and depends upon the coupling constants @xmath0 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this results is reached on the basis of large scale quantum monte - carlo simulations on lattices up to @xmath6 , and is shown to be independent on the choice of the boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we define a pairing ( magnetic ) scale by the temperature below which _ short range _ @xmath2-wave pairing correlations ( antiferromagnetic fluctuations ) start growing . with finite temperature quantum monte carlo simulations , we demonstrate that both scales are identical over a large energy range . </S>",
    "<S> those results show the extreme compatibility and close interplay of antiferromagnetic fluctuations and @xmath2-wave superconductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> the understanding of the interplay between @xmath2-wave superconductivity and antiferromagnetism is a central issue for the understanding of the phase diagram of high-@xmath7 superconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this work is to further study a model which shows a quantum transition between a @xmath2-wave superconductor and an antiferromagnetic mott insulator . </S>",
    "<S> it thus enables us to address the above question . </S>",
    "<S> the model we consider , has been introduced in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is defined by : @xmath8 with the hopping kinetic energy @xmath9 here , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron on site @xmath15 with z - component of spin @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we impose twisted boundary conditions : @xmath17 with @xmath18 the flux quanta and @xmath19 the linear length of the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary conditions given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound ] ) account for a magnetic flux threading a torus on which the lattice is wrapped . one major advantage of the above model consists in the fact that at half - band filling , the sign problem in the quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) method may be avoided . </S>",
    "<S> this statement is valid even for the above boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter , we will only consider the half - filled case .    </S>",
    "<S> previously we have considered the model of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tuw ] ) at fixed values of @xmath5 and as a function of @xmath0 . at @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the quantum transition between the mott insulator and @xmath2-wave superconductor occurs at @xmath21 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have equally considered the model at finite doping and given numerical evidence of the occurrence of a doping induced quantum transition between the mott insulator and @xmath2-wave superconductor @xcite . here , we fix @xmath22 and vary @xmath1 for the half - filled case . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this choice of parameters is that it provides us with a _ </S>",
    "<S> large _ </S>",
    "<S> parameter range in the superconducting phase where qmc simulations are extremely precise , thus allowing us to reach large lattices . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to reliably study the nature of the spin degrees of freedom in the superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> we have used two qmc algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> i ) the projector qmc algorithm which produces zero temperature results in a canonical ensemble @xcite and ii ) the finite temperature grand canonical qmc method @xcite . the application of those algorithms for the above model has been discussed in reference @xcite . both algorithms , generate a systematic error proportional to @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the imaginary time step . to determine the exponent of the spin - spin correlations </S>",
    "<S> we have extrapolated @xmath24 to zero .    </S>",
    "<S> we first concentrate of the charge degrees of freedom at zero temperature . to distinguish between a superconductor and insulator </S>",
    "<S> , we compute the ground state energy as a function of the twist in the boundary condition : @xmath25 . for an insulator , </S>",
    "<S> the wave function is localized and hence , an exponential decay of @xmath26 as a function of lattice size is expected @xcite . in the hartree - fock spin density wave ( sdw ) approximation for the half - filled hubbard model , one obtains @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the localization length of the wave function . on the other hand , for a superconductor </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath29 shows anomalous flux quantization : @xmath30 is a periodic function of @xmath31 with period @xmath32 and a non vanishing energy barrier is to be found between the flux minima @xcite so that @xmath33 remains finite as @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sut0.fig ] ) plots @xmath35 versus @xmath36 at @xmath22 and for various values of @xmath1 . at values of @xmath37 , </S>",

    "<S> , the data may be fitted to the above sdw form . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for values of @xmath22 , the data is consistent with the occurrence of a quantum transition between a superconductor and a mott insulator at @xmath39 .    in order to determine the symmetry of the superconducting state , </S>",
    "<S> we have computed equal time pairing correlations in the extended @xmath40-wave and @xmath41 channels : @xmath42 with @xmath43 here , @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 ( @xmath47 . the vertex contribution to the above quantity is given by : @xmath48 per definition , @xmath49 in the absence of interactions . </S>",

    "<S> one notices a plateau structure as a function of distance . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolation of this plateau value to the thermodynamic limit is hard and the above criterion of flux quantization , proves to be a more efficient method to conclude superconductivity @xcite . in comparison to the @xmath2-wave signal </S>",
    "<S> , the extended @xmath40-wave signal at _ large _ distances ( data not shown ) may not be distinguished from zero within our accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the extended @xmath40-wave pair - field correlation dominate at short distances . </S>",
    "<S> the data confirming this statement may be found in the table .    </S>",
    "<S> the added @xmath0-term , contains no processes which explicitly favor @xmath2-wave superconductivity . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , one would expect the @xmath0-term to favor extended @xmath40-wave symmetry , and this shows up on short length scales . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath2-wave symmetry dominates at long - range is a result of the underlying magnetic structure .    to study the spin degrees of freedom , </S>",

    "<S> we consider periodic boundary conditions , and various values of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath56 is constant and set to @xmath57 . for values of @xmath58 </S>",
    "<S> the data is consistent with a powerlaw decay : @xmath59 at @xmath38 extrapolation of the data leads to a finite staggered moment , and thus the presence of antiferromagnetic long - range order . </S>",
    "<S> the statement in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ s_alpha ] ) is surprising and deserves confirmation . </S>",
    "<S> to cross - check the validity of the above equation , we demonstrate numerically that it is independent on the choice of the boundary condition . </S>",

    "<S> [ spin_ln.fig ] plots @xmath55 at @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath22 . at @xmath62 , </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines corresponds to least square fits to the form @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus determine the exponent @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the data at @xmath65 is consistent at large distances with the form @xmath66 thus showing that the exponent @xmath67 is independent on the choice of the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath65 simulations we were able to reach lattices up to @xmath6 . at @xmath61 and for the boundary conditions set by @xmath65 , @xmath68 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pair.fig ] ) decays slower than @xmath55 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spin_ln.fig ] ) thus confirming that the pairing correlations are dominant @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> having put eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ s_alpha ] ) on a numerically firm basis , we now argue why it is a surprising result . in two dimensions , correlation functions which decay slower than @xmath69 lead to divergences in fourier space . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform of the spin - spin correlations at @xmath61 is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sq.fig ] . </S>",
    "<S> one sees a systematic increase of @xmath70 as a function of system size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , a mean field @xmath2-wave bcs calculation , yields spin - spin correlations which decays as a powerlaw with @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> this mean - field result leads to a finite @xmath72 in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> another surprise comes from the dependence of the exponent @xmath64 on the coupling constants , @xmath5 and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a feature which occurs in one dimensional quantum systems such as the @xmath73 or hubbard models .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the model at finite temperatures with the use of the grand - canonical qmc algorithm . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ tjtp.fig ] ( a ) we plot s(q ) for values of @xmath1 ranging from @xmath74 to @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> we define the magnetic scale , @xmath76 , as the temperature scale where @xmath77 starts growing . in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ tjtp.fig ] ( b ) and ( c ) we consider the vertex contribution to the @xmath2-wave paring correlations at distance @xmath78 : @xmath79 . here </S>",
    "<S> , we consider an @xmath80 lattice . at this distance </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath40-wave pairing correlations are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> we define the @xmath2-wave pairing scale , @xmath81 , by the temperature scale at which @xmath79 starts growing . from the data , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that @xmath82 that is , antiferromagnetic fluctuations as well as @xmath2-wave pairing fluctuations occur hand in hand at the same energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) antiferromagnetic correlations ( @xmath2-wave pair - field correlations ) will dominate at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in the large @xmath1 limit , @xmath76 should scale as @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> that up to @xmath75 we still do not see this behavior , may be traced back to the fact that the @xmath0-term enhances the band - width @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath86 is a natural consequence of the assumption of @xmath87 symmetry which unifies antiferromagnetism with @xmath2-wave superconductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the data , however , does not demonstrate the presence of this symmetry in this model and further work is required .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have considered aspects of the @xmath88 model defined in eq.([tuw ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model , at half - band filling , shows rich physics and allows us to study the interplay between magnetism and @xmath2-wave superconductivity . </S>",

    "<S> \\sim e^{-i \\vec{r }   \\cdot \\vec{q } }    @xmath64 is in the range @xmath90 and depends on the coupling constants @xmath91 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> those conclusions are based on large scale calculations for system sizes up to @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> we have equally shown that the energy scales at which @xmath2-wave pairing and antiferromagnetic fluctuations occur are identical . </S>",
    "<S> the further understanding of spin and charge dynamics , as well as the doping of the model remains for further studies . </S>"
