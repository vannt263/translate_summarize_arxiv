    "the nuclear shell model has provided a very successful framework for describing the properties of a wide range of nuclei .",
    "this framework is basically an effective theory @xcite , corresponding to reducing the full - space nuclear many - body problem to a model - space one with effective hamiltonian @xmath8=@xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "hamiltonian and @xmath11 represents the projection operator for the model space which is usually chosen to be a small shell - model space such as the @xmath2 shell outside of an @xmath12 closed core .",
    "the effective interaction @xmath13 plays a central role in this nuclear shell model approach , and its choice and/or determination have been extensively studied , see e.g.   @xcite . as discussed in these references , @xmath13 may be determined using either an empirical approach where it is required to reproduce selected experimental data or a microscopic one where @xmath13 is derived from realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions using many - body methods .",
    "the folded - diagram theory @xcite is a commonly used such method for the latter .",
    "briefly speaking , in this theory @xmath13 is given as a folded - diagram series @xcite v_eff= - ^ + ^ - ^ , [ veff ] where @xmath5 represents a so - called @xmath5-box , which may be written as q()=[pvp+pvqqvp]_l .",
    "[ qboxe ] here @xmath14 represents the nn interaction and @xmath15 is the so - called starting energy which will be explained later ( section ii ) .",

    "the lee - suzuki ( ls ) @xcite iteration scheme has been commonly used in previous microscopic calculations of shell model effective interactions @xcite . here",
    "we would like to employ two different methods , the krenciglowa - kuo ( kk ) iteration method @xcite and the newly developed extended krenciglowa - kuo iteration method of okamoto , suzuki , kumagai and fujii ( ekko)@xcite , mainly for the purpose of calculating the shell - model efective interactions for non - degenerate model spaces . as we shall discuss later , it is not convenient to use the ls method for calculating the effective interactions for non - degenerate model spaces such as the @xmath3 two - shell case , while both the ekko and the kk methods can be conveniently applied in this situation .",
    "the ekko method has an additional advantage .",
    "when the @xmath11- and @xmath16-space are not adequately separated from each other , the @xmath5-box employed in the kk method may have singularities , causing difficulty for its iterative solution . an essential and interesting difference between the ekko and kk methods",
    "is that the ekko method employs the vertex function @xmath4-box ( to be defined in section ii ) while in the latter the vertex function @xmath5-box is used .",

    ", both the ekko and kk methods may provide a suitable framework for calculating shell - model effective interactions for large non - degenerate model spaces which may be needed for describing exotic nuclei with large neutron excess .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we shall describe a non - degenerate version of the ekko method @xcite and how we apply it and the kk method @xcite to shell - model effective interactions . a comparison of these two methods with the ls scheme @xcite will be made .",

    "the kk and ekko methods will then be employed to calcualte the non - degenerate @xmath3 two - shell effective interactions .",
    "the matrix elements of the above degenerate and non - degenerate interactions will be compared .",
    "the low - energy spectra of @xmath6o , @xmath6f , @xmath7o and @xmath7f given by these interactions will be discussed .",
    "a summary and conclusion will be presented in section iv .",
    "in this section , we shall describe and discuss the kk @xcite and the ekko @xcite iteration methods and their application to microscopic calculations of shell - model effective interactions .",
    "these methods , to our knowledge , have not yet been employed in such calculations .",
    "let us begin with a brief review of the ls @xcite and kk iteration methods .",
    "consider first the degenerate ls method where the model space is degenerate , namely @xmath23 , @xmath24 being a constant . in terms of the @xmath5-box of eq.(2 ) , the effective interactions @xmath25 are calculated iteratively by @xcite r_1 = q(w_0 ) , r_2= ( w_0 ) , and for @xmath26 r_n = ( w_0 ) , where @xmath27 is proportional to the @xmath28 derivative of @xmath5 : _ m = .",

    "this becomes increasingly difficult , and therefore such calculations are usually limited to low orders in the iteration .",
    "however , as we shall demonstrate in section iiia , low - order ls iterations are often not accurate when the @xmath11- and @xmath16-spaces are strongly coupled .    the above degenerate ls iteration method can be generalized to a non - degenrate one @xcite , namely @xmath29 being non - degenerate . in this situation",
    "we need not only the @xmath5-box of eq .",
    "( [ qboxe ] ) but also a generalized @xmath30-box defined by @xmath31_l.\\ ] ] with @xmath32 this generalized @xmath5-box is defined for @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is defined by @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the dimension of the @xmath11-space is labelled @xmath37 .",
    "note that only valence - linked diagrams are retained in @xmath38 , as indicated by the subscript l.    with the above definitions , the effective interaction given by the non - degenerate ls iteration method is given as @xcite @xmath39^{-1 }   \\hat{q}(\\epsilon_{\\alpha})p_{\\alpha } ,   \\nonumber\\\\   r_3&=&\\sum_{\\alpha }   \\left[1-\\sum_{\\beta}\\hat{q}_1\\left(\\epsilon_{\\alpha \\beta } \\right )   p_{\\beta }      -\\sum_{\\beta \\gamma}\\hat{q}_2\\left(\\epsilon_{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma } \\right)p_{\\beta}r_2p_{\\gamma }   \\right]^{-1 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\hat{q}(\\epsilon_{\\alpha})p_{\\alpha } ,   \\nonumber \\\\   & \\cdots &    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath40 , @xmath41 . in the above equations @xmath42 . when convergent , we have @xmath43 .",
    "the above non - degenerate ls method can be used to calculate the effective interactions for e.g. , the non - degenerate @xmath44-shell @xcite or the two - shell @xmath3 model space . but this method is rather complicated for computations , and this has hindered its application to microscopic calculations of shell - model effective interactions .",
    "we now describe some details of the non - degenerate kk and ekko methods .",
    "the kk iteration method was originally developed for model spaces which are degenerate @xcite .",
    "a non - degenerate kk iteration method was later formulated @xcite , with the effective interaction given by the following iteration methods .",
    "let the effective interaction for the _ i_th iteration be @xmath45 and the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath46 and eigenfunctions @xmath47 be given by @xmath48\\chi_m^{(i)}=e_m^{(i ) } \\chi_m^{(i)}.\\ ] ] here @xmath49 is the @xmath11-space projection of the full - space eigenfunction @xmath50 , namely @xmath51 .",

    "when convergent , the resultant @xmath13 is independent of @xmath56 , as it is the states with maximum @xmath11-space overlaps which are selected by the kk method @xcite . we shall discuss this feature later in section iii using a solvable model .",
    "the above non - degenerate kk method is numerically more convenient than the non - degenerate ls method .",
    "the diagrams of fig .  1 have both one - body ( d1,d2,d3 ) and two - body ( d4,d5,d6,d7 ) diagrams .",
    "when we calculate nuclei with two valence nucleons such as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , all seven diagrams are included in the @xmath5-box .",
    "but for nuclei with one valence nucleon such as @xmath58 , we deal with the 1-body @xmath59-box which is approximated by the sum of diagrams d1 , d2 and d3 .",

    "a similar subtraction procedure has also been employed in the ls calculations @xcite where the all - order sum of the one - body diagrams was subtracted from the calculation of the effective interaction .    in several aspects , the above kk method provides a more desirable framework for effective interaction calculations than the commonly used ls method .",
    "the kk method is more convenient for non - degenerate model spaces than the ls method , and the kk method does not require the calculation of high - order derivatives of the @xmath5-box , which may be necessary in a converged ls calculation .",

    "the results so obtained are not in good agreement with the exact results .",

    "note that for this case the ekko method is clearly more accurate than the kk method .",
    "we have noticed that for a number of cases the ekko method converges well but not so for the kk method .",
    "this is largely because these two methods treat the singularities of the @xmath5-box differently . to see this ,",

    "there @xmath114 is discontinuous , diverging oppositely before and after the pole , while @xmath115 remains continuous throughout .",

    "7 we compare the matrix elements of the @xmath3 two - shell ekko interaction with those of the @xmath2 one - shell case .",
    "only the matrix elements within the @xmath2 shell are shown .",
    "we find that the magnitudes of the two - shell matrix elements are generally weaker than the one - shell matrix elements , some differing by as much as 1 mev . despite these differences ,",
    "the resulting spectra for @xmath6o and @xmath6f given by the one - shell and two - shell calculations are nearly equivalent to each other , as illustrated by the two middle columns of fig .",
    "8 . in our present and subsequent calculations",
    "we employ a low - order @xmath5-box consisting of the 1st- and 2nd - order diagrams of fig .",
    "it is instructive , however , to compare the one- and two - shell calculations when only the leading - order approximation to the @xmath5-box is retained . in the two leftmost columns of fig .",
    "8 we show the spectra of @xmath6f when only the 1st - order @xmath5-box diagrams are included .",
    "we note that in this case ( in contrast to the second - order @xmath5-box calculation ) the resulting @xmath2 ` 1 shell ' and @xmath3 ` 2 shell ' spectra are largely different .",
    "this important observation can be explained as follows . in general , the different @xmath2 and @xmath3 model spaces will result in different effective interactions and associated effective hamiltonians , which we denote by @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "but since the @xmath2 model space is a subspace of @xmath3 model space , @xmath142 and @xmath143 should in principle have common eigenvalues .",
    "we would like to check that this requirement is satisfied by our present calculations . as indicated by the two middle columns of fig .",
    "8 , we see that indeed this is the case .",
    "in fact among the many states given by the @xmath3 calculations , it is the ones with the maximum @xmath2-space overlaps which agree with the results given by the @xmath2-shell calculation , which is a physically desirable result . because of the difference in the model spaces , the renormalization effects for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 effective interactions are different . to bridge these differences , we need to include at least the 2nd - order @xmath5-box diagrams",
    "( note that the allowed intermediate states of the 2nd - order @xmath5-box diagrams are model - space dependent ) .",
    "these diagrams are not included in the above 1st - order calculations , and consequently the @xmath2 and @xmath3 results are different as shown by the two leftmost columns of fig .",
    "8 , which is a strong evidence for the importance of the model - space - dependent renormalization effects .",
    "the construction of model - space effective interactions is in many ways similar to the construction of an effective theory from a renormalization group evolution . in such cases",
    ", one would expect that despite the different effective hamiltonians , the same low - energy physical observables would be reproduced .",
    "the shell model effective interactions in the present work have not been computed exactly ( that is , including high - order diagrams in the @xmath5-box ) , yet it is interesting that we nevertheless find excellent agreement between the one- and two - shell calculations including @xmath5-box diagrams only up to second order .    to further study the @xmath2 one - shell and @xmath3 two - shell effective interactions , we have applied them to shell model calculations of @xmath7o and @xmath7f . the 2nd - order @xmath5-box of fig .  1 is employed .",
    "our results are displayed respectively in figs .",
    "it is of interest that the one - shell and two - shell results for @xmath7o are nearly identical , and for @xmath7f they are also remarkably close to each other .",
    "although the orderings of our calculated spectra are in fair agreements with experiments , there are significant differences between them . as discussed earlier , in our @xmath3 two - shell calcualtions the experimental s.p .",
    "energies for the four @xmath140 orbits are needed , but their values are not well known .",
    "so far we have chosen to place them at a separation of 14 mev above the @xmath131 orbit .",
    "we have repeated our calculations using instead a smaller separation of 10 mev , to investigate if the use a smaller separation may improve the agreements . as illustrated in fig .",
    "11 , the low - lying states of @xmath134 are hardly changed , those given by the separations of 14 and 10 mev being nearly identical .",
    "the differences between the two sets of states for @xmath144 are also generally small . that these low - lying states are insensitive to the above separations indicates that our @xmath3 effective interactions ( obtained with the inclusion of the 1st- and 2nd - order @xmath5-box diagrams of fig .",
    "1 ) have a rather weak coupling between the @xmath2 and @xmath145 shells .",
    "recall that we have employed the folded - diagram expansion of eq .",
    "( 1 ) to calculate the effective interaction @xmath13 . for nuclei with three valence nucleons ,",
    "this expansion has both 2-body and 3-body diagrams .",
    "( by 3-body diagrams we mean those valence - linked diagrams with three incoming and three outgoing valence lines @xcite . ) as an example , the shell - model three - nucleon force diagram of fig .",
    "12 should be included in the @xmath2 one - shell effective interaction for @xmath7o and @xmath7f . but this diagram is not included in our present @xmath2 one - shell calculation as we employ only the two - body @xmath5-box of fig .  1 .",
    "this diagram is , however , included in our @xmath3 shell model calculations for @xmath7o and @xmath7f .",
    "thus the good agreement between the one - shell and two - shell results shown in fig .",
    "9 is an indication that this type of shell - model three - nucleon force is likely to have little importance for @xmath7o spectra , while it is moderately important for @xmath7f as suggested by the small difference shown in fig .",
    "further studies of this type of three - nucleon force will be useful and of interest , and we plan to do so in a future study .",
    "we have applied the iteration method of krenciglowa and kuo ( kk ) and that recently developed by okamoto _",
    "et al_.  ( ekko ) to the microscopic derivation of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 shell - model effective interactions using the low - momentum nucleon - nucleon interaction derived from the chiral @xmath146 two - body potential .",
    "we first considered a solvable model and found that both methods are suitable and efficient for deriving the effective interactions for non - degenerate model spaces , where the lee - suzuki iteration method is considerably less convenient .",
    "even in the situation where the @xmath11- and @xmath16-space unperturbed hamiltonians have spectrum overlaps did the kk and ekko methods perform remarkably well .",
    "the ekko method has the special advantage that its vertex function @xmath4-box is , by construction , a continuous function of the energy , while the @xmath5-box function used in the ls and kk methods may have singularities .",
    "this feature was found to be particularly useful for the convergence of the ekko iteration method .    using the @xmath0 low - momentum potentialss",
    "obtained from above two - body interaction , we first calculated the degenerate @xmath2 one - shell effective interactions using the ls , kk and ekko methods .",
    "the results given by kk and ekko were found to be identical .",
    "it is noteworthy that the ls results , calculated with a low - order ( 5th order ) iteration , were also in very good agreement with both the kk and ekko results , supporting the accuracy of the low - order ls method for calculating the degenerate shell - model effective interactions .",
    "we have calculated the non - degenerate @xmath3 two - shell effective interactions using both the ekko and kk methods .",
    "both methods gave identical results and were found to be suitable for such non - degenerate calculations , with the former being more efficient ( faster converging ) .",
    "we have applied these interactions to compute the low - lying energy spectra for several nuclei with two and three valence nucleons above the @xmath147o core .",
    "since the @xmath2 model space is a subspace of the @xmath3 model space , we expect the effective hamiltonians for these two spaces to have common eigenvalues .",
    "indeed this was largely confirmed in our calculations of @xmath6o , @xmath6f , @xmath7o and @xmath7f spectra , where it was found that the states in the @xmath3 calculations with the maximum @xmath2-space overlap agreed with the results given by the @xmath2 calculations .",
    "the above agreement was found to be excellent for @xmath7o , though not as good for @xmath7f , which indicates that the shell - model three - nucleon force is more important in @xmath7f ( where the proton - neutron interaction is involved ) than in @xmath7o .",
    "further study of this three - nucleon force should be useful and of much interest .",
    "the calculated ground state energies for the above four nuclei are all higher ( less bound ) than the corresponding experimental values .",
    "we are studying if the inclusion of the chiral three - nucleon force may give additional binding energy @xcite . in the present work we have employed the @xmath5-box irreducible vertex function consisting of the first- and second - order diagrams only .",
    "the inclusion of the kirson - babu - brown ( kbb ) all - order core polarization diagrams in the @xmath5-box may provide additional binding energy @xcite .",
    "we plan to carry out futher calculations with the inclusion of such all - order kbb diagrams .",
