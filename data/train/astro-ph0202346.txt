    "one of the most sensational discoveries of the past decade is that our universe is currently accelerating .",
    "this observation finds support in the luminosity measurements of high - redshift supernovae @xcite , measurements of degree - scale anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background @xcite and , indirectly , in the observations of gravitational clustering @xcite .",
    "although a cosmological constant appears to satisfy all current observations , the formidable fine - tuning difficulties which accompany a non - evolving @xmath7-term have prompted theorists to investigate alternative , evolving forms of dark energy .",
    "theoretical models of dark energy usually involve matter fields possessing unusual properties such as a negative equation of state .",
    "popular dark - energy models include scalar - field - based ` quintessence ' models , models based on quantum particle production , chaplygin gas etc .",
    "( see @xcite for recent reviews ) . in this paper",
    ", we examine a radically different mechanism for the late time acceleration of the universe in which dark energy effectively emerges from the gravity sector and not the matter sector of the theory .",
    "we study a higher - dimensional cosmology in which the observable universe is a four - dimensional ` brane ' embedded in a five - dimensional bulk",
    ". models of this kind appeared after the seminal paper by randall & sundrum ( rs ) @xcite .",
    "subsequent intensive investigation showed that cosmology based on the rs model exhibits departure from standard general - relativistic behaviour only at very early cosmological times @xcite .",
    "the model which we study in this paper generalizes the rs model in that , besides the brane and bulk cosmological constants , it also includes the scalar curvature term in the action for the brane . in an interesting recent development , deffayet , dvali , and gabadadze ( ddg )",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the presence of the scalar curvature term in the action for the brane can lead to a late - time acceleration of the universe even in the absence of any material form of dark energy @xcite .",
    "the main difference between our model and the ddg model is that , in addition to the scalar curvature term in the action for the brane , we also include the brane and bulk cosmological constants .",
    "( the bulk and brane cosmological constants were set equal to zero in the ddg model . )",
    "the presence of bulk and brane cosmological constants in our braneworld ( in addition to the brane curvature term ) leads to several qualitatively new features that distinguish our model from the ddg model as well as from the scalar - field - based ` quintessence ' models .",
    "an important property of our braneworld universe is that the ( effective ) equation of state of dark energy can be @xmath8 .",
    "( the ddg braneworld model and quintessence models have @xmath9 . ) in addition , the acceleration of the universe in our braneworld scenario can be a _",

    "we find that a class of braneworld models accelerate during the present epoch but revert back to matter - dominated expansion at late times .",
    "a _ transiently accelerating _ braneworld does not possess an event horizon and could reconcile a currently accelerating universe with the demands of string / m - theory .",
    "our paper is organised as follows .",
    "after describing the braneworld model in the next section , in sec .",
    "[ vacua ] we proceed to the case of vacuum braneworlds , that is , solutions with zero stress - energy tensor of matter .",
    "we derive a general expression for the effective cosmological constant in such models and describe some classes of its symmetric solutions , including _ empty _ static homogeneous and isotropic universes .",
    "we also present simple expressions for a static universe filled with matter . in sec .",
    "[ cosmology ] we study the cosmological evolution of the braneworld .",
    "we shall show that braneworld models have properties similar to the observed ( accelerating ) universe for a large region of parameter space .",
    "for instance , the model under consideration can mimic the evolution of a frw universe in which dark energy has pressure  to  energy - density ratio @xmath10 both larger _ as well as smaller _ than the critical value of @xmath11 . for a subclass of parameter values , braneworld dark energy and the acceleration of the universe",
    "are _ transient _ phenomena so that the universe , after the current period of acceleration , re - enters the matter - dominated regime . in sec .",
    "[ final ] we formulate our conclusions .",
    "in this paper , we consider the case where a braneworld is the timelike boundary of a five - dimensional purely gravitational lorentzian space ( bulk ) , which is equivalent to the case of a brane embedded in the bulk with @xmath12 symmetry of reflection with respect to the brane .",
    "the theory is described by the action @xcite @xmath13 + \\int_{\\rm brane } \\left ( m^2 r - 2 \\sigma \\right ) + \\int_{\\rm brane } l \\left ( h_{ab } , \\phi \\right ) \\ , .\\ ] ] here , @xmath14 is the scalar curvature of the metric @xmath15 in the five - dimensional bulk , and @xmath16 is the scalar curvature of the induced metric @xmath17 on the brane , where @xmath18 is the vector field of the inner unit normal to the brane , and the notation and conventions of @xcite are used .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 is the trace of the symmetric tensor of extrinsic curvature @xmath20 of the brane .",
    "the symbol @xmath21 denotes the lagrangian density of the four - dimensional matter fields @xmath22 whose dynamics is restricted to the brane so that they interact only with the induced metric @xmath23 .",
    "all integrations over the bulk and brane are taken with the natural volume elements @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the determinants of the matrices of components of the corresponding metrics in a coordinate basis .",
    "the symbols @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote , respectively , the five - dimensional and four - dimensional planck masses , @xmath30 is the bulk cosmological constant , and @xmath31 is the brane cosmological constant , also called the brane tension .    the parameter @xmath32 in the first term of action ( [ action ] ) reflects the possibility of different relative signs between the bulk and brane terms in the action . in the context of homogeneous friedmann cosmology that will be subject of this paper ,",
    "the differential equations on the brane will not depend on the sign of @xmath33 .",
    "however , different signs of @xmath33 result in different ways of embedding of a brane with one and the same induced metric in the bulk space , which may be important for studying perturbations of the theory .",
    "the term containing the scalar curvature of the induced metric on the brane with the coupling @xmath34 in action ( [ action ] ) is often neglected in the literature .",
    "however , this term is qualitatively essential for describing the braneworld dynamics since it is inevitably generated as a quantum correction to the matter action in ( [ action ] )  in the spirit of an idea that goes back to sakharov @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "note that the effective action for the brane typically involves an infinite number of terms of higher order in curvature ( this was pointed out in @xcite for the case of braneworld theory ; a similar situation in the context of the ads / cft correspondence is described in @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we retain only the terms linear in curvature .",
    "the linear effects of the curvature term on the brane were studied in @xcite , where it was shown that it leads to four - dimensional law of gravity on sufficiently small scales . for some recent reviews of the results connected with the induced - gravity term in the brane action",
    ", one may look into @xcite .",
    "action ( [ action ] ) leads to the bulk being described by the usual einstein equation with cosmological constant : @xmath35 while the field equation on the brane is @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is the stress - energy tensor on the brane , and it stems from the last term in action ( [ action ] ) . in eq .",
    "( [ brane ] ) we have underlined the term whose presence makes braneworld theory different from general relativity .",
    "( it should perhaps be mentioned that the variation of action ( [ action ] ) which includes the gibbons  hawking surface term @xmath38 leads to the israel junction conditions @xcite on the brane , as demonstrated in @xcite . ) from ( [ brane ] ) one can show that there exists a scale whose value determines the domain in which general relativity is approximately valid @xcite .",
    "indeed , we can write @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the characteristic curvature radii of solution of eq .",
    "( [ brane ] ) . then the ratio of the last term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ brane ] ) to the first term on its left - hand side is of the order @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a convenient definition to be used later .",
    "thus , for @xmath44 , the last term on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ brane ] ) can be neglected , and general relativity is recovered . in typical situations ,",
    "e.g. , in cosmology , we often have @xmath45 , and general relativity becomes valid for @xmath46 .",
    "this fact was used in @xcite , where the cosmological model with @xmath47 and @xmath48 was considered .",
    "therefore , an important distinguishing feature of the braneworld models which we consider , is that they can show departure from standard frw behaviour at _ late times _ and on large scales .",
    "this property should be contrasted with the braneworld cosmology based on the randall  sundrum model @xcite ( with @xmath49 ) , in which nonstandard behaviour is encountered at very early times @xcite .    by contracting the gauss identity @xmath50 on the brane and using eq .",
    "( [ bulk ] ) , one obtains the ` constraint ' equation @xmath51 which , together with ( [ brane ] ) , implies the following closed scalar equation on the brane : @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "one method for obtaining solutions of the theory consists in first solving the scalar equation ( [ closed ] ) on the brane together with the stress - energy conservation equation , and then integrating the einstein equations in the bulk with the given data on the brane @xcite .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ closed ] ) describes the evolution on the brane in terms of its intrinsic quantities , and that all homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions for the brane can be obtained from this equation @xcite , as will also be done below .",
    "all such solutions are embeddable in the schwarzschild - ads five - dimensional bulk .",
    "however , one can not confine oneself to this single equation in the general case , e.g. , in studying perturbations of the cosmological solution , where one must also solve equations in the bulk imposing certain boundary and/or regularity conditions . from this general viewpoint ,",
    "( [ closed ] ) can not be regarded as complete : only those of its solutions are admissible which can be developed to regular solutions in the bulk .",
    "this illustrates the importance of the precise specification of boundary and/or regularity conditions in the bulk for a complete formulation of the brane - world theory @xcite .",
    "the gravitational equations in the bulk can be integrated by using , for example , gaussian normal coordinates , as described , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "specifically , in the gaussian normal coordinates @xmath54 , where @xmath55 are the coordinates on the brane and @xmath56 is the fifth coordinate in the bulk , the metric in the bulk is written as @xmath57 introducing also the tensor of extrinsic curvature @xmath58 of every hypersurface @xmath59 in the bulk , one can obtain the following system of differential equations for the components @xmath60 and @xmath61 : @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the components of the ricci tensor of the metric @xmath60 induced on the hypersurface @xmath59 , @xmath65 is its scalar curvature , and @xmath66 is the trace of the tensor of extrinsic curvature .",
    "the second equality in ( [ s ] ) is true by virtue of the ` constraint ' equation ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ s ] ) and ( [ metric ] ) together with the ` constraint ' equation ( [ constraint ] ) represent the @xmath67 splitting of the einstein equations in the gaussian normal coordinates .",
    "the initial conditions for these equations are defined on the brane through eq .",
    "( [ brane ] ) .",
    "we emphasise once again that , to obtain a complete braneworld theory in the general case ( including a stability analysis ) , one must also specify additional conditions in the bulk such as the presence of other branes or certain regularity conditions . in our paper , we deal only with the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology on the brane , so this issue does not arise .",
    "in this sense , we are studying here the cosmological features common to the whole class of braneworld models described by action ( [ action ] ) with arbitrary boundary conditions in the bulk .",
    "we proceed to the cosmological implications of the braneworld theory under consideration . in this section",
    ", we discuss the situation pertaining to a vacuum brane , i.e. , when the matter stress - energy tensor @xmath68 .",
    "it is interesting that the brane approaches this condition during the course of cosmological evolution provided it expands forever and its matter density asymptotically declines to zero . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ closed ] ) takes the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 it is important to note that the second term in eq .",
    "( [ vacuum ] ) has _ precisely _ the form of one of the terms in the expression for the conformal anomaly , which describes the vacuum polarization at the one - loop level in curved space - time ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . can not be obtained by the variation of a local four - dimensional lagrangian , the very same term is obtained via the variation of a local lagrangian in the five - dimensional braneworld theory under investigation . ]",
    "it therefore immediately follows that all _ symmetric spaces _ are solutions of eq .",
    "( [ vacuum ] ) with appropriate @xmath71 , just as they are solutions of the einstein equations with one - loop quantum - gravitational corrections @xcite .",
    "symmetric spaces satisfy the condition @xmath72 , which implies that geometrical invariants such as @xmath73 , and @xmath16 are constants so that eq .",
    "( [ vacuum ] ) becomes an algebraic equation .",

    "the four dimensional metric ( [ desitter ] ) has the property @xmath78 , and formed the basis for starobinsky s first inflationary model sustained by the quantum conformal anomaly @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the homogeneous and anisotropic nariai metric @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 = constant , @xmath75 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and for which @xmath83 . in fact , it is easy to show that any metric for which @xmath16 and @xmath84 are constants will automatically be a solution to eq .",

    "for the frequently discussed special case @xmath49 , one obtains @xmath87 .",
    "the two signs in ( [ lambda ] ) correspond to the two different ways in which the lower - dimensional brane can form the boundary of the higher - dimensional bulk @xcite . in the case of a spherically symmetrical bulk , the ` @xmath88 ' sign corresponds to a brane as a boundary for which the _ inner _ normal to the brane points in the direction of decreasing bulk radial coordinate .",
    "the condition @xmath89 is the well - known fine - tuning condition of randall and sundrum @xcite and leads to the vanishing of the cosmological constant on an empty brane if we set @xmath90 in ( [ action ] ) .",
    "note that , under the randall  sundrum condition , expression ( [ lambda ] ) with the sign opposite to the sign of the quantity @xmath91 also gives a zero value for the resulting cosmological constant on the brane , but the other sign usually leads to @xmath92 .",
    "we would like to draw the reader s attention to the fact that eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) is meaningful only when the expression under the square root is nonnegative .",
    "when it is negative , solutions describing the corresponding empty universe simply do not exist .",
    "this leads to the following important conclusion : a universe which contains matter and satisfies @xmath93 _ can not expand forever_.    for the special case @xmath94 , the expression for @xmath95 is given by @xmath96 in this case , both @xmath31 and @xmath71 must be negative in order that the corresponding empty universe exist , but the resulting cosmological constant on the brane can be of any sign .",
    "another interesting example is that of a static empty universe . the radius ( scale factor ) @xmath97 of such a universe is easily determined from ( [ vacuum ] ) to be @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the sign of the spatial curvature .",
    "one can see that the radius of the universe can be arbitrarily large . in the general case",
    ", the development of this solution to the five - dimensional bulk leads to a schwarzschild  anti - de  sitter metric .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , for @xmath100 , this metric is purely anti - de  sitter ( with zero schwarzschild mass ) if the constants of the theory satisfy the condition @xmath101 which implies negative brane tension @xmath31 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the static and empty braneworld solution described by ( [ static ] ) does not possess a general - relativistic analog , since , in general relativity , a static cosmological model ( the ` static einstein universe ' ) _ can not _ be empty ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , from ( [ static ] ) we find that the static empty universe can be spatially open ( @xmath102 )  for example , in the case @xmath103 and @xmath104 ,  again a situation without an analog in general relativity .    for static homogeneous and isotropic braneworlds filled with matter , eq .",

    "it is worth noting that one and the same cosmological solution on the given brane can correspond to different global solutions in the bulk , for example , other branes may be present or absent , be static or evolving , close or far away from our brane , etc . in the most general case ( for instance in the absence of special symmetries on the brane ) integration on the brane needs to be performed in conjunction with dynamical integration in the bulk .",
    "all such situations must be separately studied and issues such as their stability to linearized perturbations must be examined on a case - by - case basis .",

    "the acceleration of the universe is described by the equation [ eq : acc ] = -_i ( _ i + 3p_i ) , where the summation is over all matter fields contributing to the dynamics of the universe .",

    "one might add that the behaviour of brane1 is mimicked by frw models with @xmath202 , whereas brane2 resembles dark energy with @xmath203 @xcite .",
    "in fact , from fig .  [",
    "fig : lum ] we see that the luminosity distance in the brane1 model is quite close to what one gets from ` phantom energy ' described by ( [ hubble3 ] ) with @xmath204 .",

    "some strange properties of phantom energy with a very negative equation of state ( @xmath3 ) are summarised below ( see also @xcite ) :    \\(i ) a negative equation of state suggests that the effective velocity of sound in the medium @xmath208 can become larger than the velocity of light .",

    "it immediately follows that the scale factor diverges in a _",

    "( an exact expression for the time of occupance of the phantom singularity is given in @xcite , which also contains an interesting discussion of related issues . )    at this stage one must emphasize that , although the brane1 model has several features in common with phantom energy , ( which makes us believe that , like the latter , it too is likely to provide a good fit to supernova data ) , it is not necessarily afflicted with phantom s pathologies . indeed , in a broad range of parameters , both brane1 and brane2 are physically well motivated and remain _ well behaved during all times_. the present paper therefore adds an important new dimension to the current debate about the acceleration of the universe by showing that cosmological models with @xmath220 are possible to construct within the framework of the braneworld scenario and should be taken seriously .",
    "future studies will address the important quantitative issue of whether braneworld models of dark energy provide as good ( or better ) fit to high-@xmath126 supernova observations as lcdm ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : age ] , the age of the universe at a given cosmological redshift @xmath225 is shown for the two braneworld models and for lcdm & scdm .",
    "we find that the age of the universe in brane1 ( brane2 ) is larger ( smaller ) than in lcdm for identical values of the cosmological density parameter @xmath196 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the hubble parameter in brane1 ( brane2 ) is smaller ( larger ) than in lcdm .",
    "both braneworld models are significantly older than scdm .",
    "considerable insight into the dynamics of the universe is provided by the cosmological deceleration parameter ( [ decel ] ) .",
    "our results , shown in fig .  [ fig : decel ] , indicate that at late times the brane1 ( brane2 ) universe accelerates at a faster ( slower ) rate than lcdm ( with identical @xmath196 ) .",
    "curiously , the brane1 universe shows an earlier transition from deceleration to acceleration than any of the other models .",
    "( for the given choice of parameters this transition takes place at @xmath226 for brane1 and at @xmath227 for lcdm .",
    "the brane2 model begins accelerating near the present epoch at @xmath228 . )",
    "a related point of interest is that at @xmath229 the deceleration parameter in brane1 marginally exceeds that in scdm indicating that the brane1 model is decelerating at a faster rate than scdm ( @xmath230 ) . in conventional models of dark matter",
    "this behaviour can occur only if the equation of state of the dark component is stiffer than dust , implying @xmath231 in ( [ hubble3 ] ) , or if the universe is spatially closed . on the other hand , the current _ acceleration _ rate of brane1 in our example ( @xmath232 )",

    "the unusual high-@xmath126 behaviour of the deceleration parameter in brane1 can be better understood if we consider the cosmological density parameter @xmath235 ^ 2 \\omega_{\\rm m}(0 ) ( 1+z)^3 \\ , , \\label{eq : omega}\\ ] ] where @xmath167 is given by ( [ hubble1])([omega - r2 ] ) for braneworld models . from fig .",

    "[ fig : omega ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the notion of ` effective equation of state ' is of limited utility for this model .",
    "equations ( [ hubble1 ] ) , ( [ hubble2 ] ) , ( [ decel ] ) , and ( [ eq : dark ] ) also illustrate the important fact that dark energy in braneworld models , though similar to phantom energy in some respects , differ from it in others .",
    "for instance , in both braneworld models , @xmath243 at @xmath244 and @xmath245 as @xmath246 , whereas phantom energy has @xmath247 at _ all _ times .",
    "a useful quantity is the _ current value _ of the effective equation of state of dark energy in braneworld theories : @xmath248 where the lower and upper signs , as usual , correspond to brane1 and brane2 models , respectively .",
    "we easily see that @xmath249 for brane1 , whereas @xmath250 for brane2 .",
    "the braneworld models under consideration also admit the intriguing possibility that the current acceleration of the universe may not be a lasting feature . it may be recalled that most models of dark energy including the cosmological constant have the property that , once the universe begins to accelerate , it accelerates forever . as shown in a number of recent papers ,",
    "an eternally accelerating universe is endowed with a cosmological event horizon which prevents the construction of a conventional s - matrix describing particle interactions within the framework of string or m - theory @xcite . in this section",
    "we show that , provided the randall  sundrum constraint relation ( [ rs ] ) is satisfied , the acceleration of the universe can be a transient phenomenon in braneworld models .",
    "an anisotropic solution of bianchi  v class with the same feature was described in @xcite .    from eqs .",
    "( [ hubble1 ] ) and ( [ hubble2 ] ) we obtain the following asymptotic expressions for the hubble parameter @xmath251 as @xmath213 , assuming that the universe expands forever : @xmath252 where the lower and upper signs correspond to brane1 and brane2 models , respectively . in applying the randall  sundrum constraint ( [ rs ] ) ,",
    "we first consider the case where @xmath253 .",
    "then @xmath254 and @xmath255 \\ , .\\ ] ] one can see that this expression vanishes for the lower sign .",
    "thus , for positive @xmath256 , it is the brane1 model that leads to vanishing effective cosmological constant in the future .",
    "however , in this case , the constraint equation ( [ omega - r1 ] ) with @xmath156 becomes @xmath257 and implies @xmath154 , which is hardly compatible with the observations .",
    "in the case of @xmath150 , we have @xmath258 and @xmath259 if @xmath260 , then this expression vanishes for the lower sign , which brings us back to the nonphysical brane1 models with @xmath154 .",
    "the case @xmath261 is compatible with the condition @xmath262 , which corresponds to brane1 ( [ hubble1 ] ) with the constraint equation ( [ omega - r2 ] ) .",
    "however , it can be shown that these conditions imply @xmath263 , which is also physically unacceptable .",
    "there remains the case of @xmath150 and @xmath264 . in this case , expression ( [ negative ] ) vanishes for the upper sign , which corresponds to brane2 models .",
    "the constraint equation ( [ omega - r2 ] ) with @xmath156 now reads @xmath265 and implies @xmath266 .",
    "therefore , brane2 with @xmath150 and @xmath264 , provides us with an interesting example of a physically meaningful cosmological model in which the current acceleration of the universe is a _",
    "transient phenomenon_. an example of this behaviour as probed by the deceleration parameter is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : decel_plot ] , which demonstrates that the current period of cosmic acceleration takes place between two matter - dominated epochs .",
    "we emphasize that these models require negative brane tension @xmath31 .",
    "since an observer in this model resides on a negative - tension brane one must ponder over the issue of whether such a braneworld will be perturbatively stable and hence physically viable .",
    "we consider this to be an open question for future investigations .",
    "remarks made at the end of sec .  [ vacua ] are relevant , however , since one and the same cosmological solution on the ` visible ' ( negative tension ) brane can correspond to many different global conditions in the bulk , for instance , other ( ` hidden ' ) branes may be present or absent , static or evolving , close to or far away from our brane , etc .",
    "moreover , here the sign of the parameter @xmath32 in action ( [ action ] ) is expected to be of crucial importance , since , in particular , the bulk gravity will be localised around the _ negative _ tension ( visible ) brane in the case of @xmath267 . issues of perturbative stability involve the examination of all such distinct global solutions on a case - by - case basis .",
    "such a study , though interesting and important , clearly lies beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "useful insight into the brane2 model is also provided by the effective equation of state of dark energy ( [ eq : dark ] ) .",
    "our results shown in fig .  [ fig : state_future ] indicate that the past and future behaviour of dark energy in the braneworld universe can be very different .",
    "the past behaviour @xmath243 for @xmath244 arises because , in a spatially flat braneworld , the second most important contribution to braneworld expansion at high redshifts is caused by the @xmath268 term in ( [ hubble2 ] ) ; see also @xcite .",
    "the future behaviour @xmath269 as @xmath213 , on the other hand , reflects the decreasing importance of dark energy as the universe expands .",
    "the acceleration of the universe is therefore a transient phenomenon which ends once the universe settles back into the matter - dominated regime .",
    "finally , we should mention that a transiently accelerating regime also arises in a class of brane2 models which do not satisfy the randall - sundrum constraint ( [ rs ] ) . in these models",
    "the current epoch of acceleration is succeeded by an epoch during which the deceleration parameter grows without bound .",
    "this unusual ` future singularity ' is reached in a _",
    "finite _ interval of expansion time and is characterised by the fact that both the matter density and the hubble parameter remain finite , while @xmath270 ( a feature that distinguishes it from the phantom singularities discussed in sec .",
    "a detailed discussion of the ` new ' singularities which occur in braneworld models can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have considered cosmological implications of a braneworld model described by action ( [ action ] ) , which contains both bulk and brane curvature terms and cosmological constants .",
    "the curvature term for the brane arises naturally , as a quantum correction from the matter part of the brane action , and significantly changes the behaviour of the braneworld theory . for example",
    ", as is well known , braneworld cosmology without this term deviates from general relativity at _ large _ matter densities , i.e. , at early cosmological times ; see eq .",
    "( [ cosmolim ] ) . in the model that we considered , on the other hand ,",
    "early cosmological evolution remains virtually unaffected for a broad range of parameters , significant deviations from standard cosmology appearing only during _",
    "later _ times .",
    "we restrict our attention to the important case where the brane forms the boundary of the five - dimensional bulk space .",
    "this is equivalent to endowing the bulk with the @xmath12 reflection isometry with respect to the brane .",
    "the presence of the curvature term in the action leads to two families of braneworld models .",
    "these two families ( called brane1 & brane2 ) differ in the manner in which the brane forms the boundary of the five - dimensional bulk .",
    "for example , if a spatially three - spherical brane is embedded into the three - spherically symmetric bulk , then one can discard either the interior part of the bulk , or its exterior ( asymptotically flat ) part . in this example",
    ", the models which discard the exterior part leaving the interior were classified as brane1 models , while the complementary models were called brane2 .",
    "similar classification arises in the case of spatially flat and open braneworld models .",
    "alternatively , the two different families of braneworld models can be regarded as corresponding to the two possible signs of the five - dimensional planck mass @xmath28 .",
    "braneworld models of dark energy considered in this paper have the interesting and unusual property that their luminosity distance @xmath223 can _ exceed _ that in lcdm .",
    "this is unusual since , within the general - relativistic framework , the luminosity distance has this property _ only if _ the equation of state of dark energy is strongly negative ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "caldwell @xcite has shown that dark energy with @xmath3 ( phantom energy ) may in fact fit supernova observations better than lcdm .",
    "however , phantom energy is beset with a host of undesirable properties which makes this model of dark energy unattractive .",
    "we show that braneworld models have all the advantages and none of the disadvantages of phantom models and therefore endow dark energy with exciting new possibilities .",
    "a recent analysis of braneworld models in @xcite has demonstrated that brane1 models ( which generically have @xmath271 ) provide an excellent fit to supernovae observations for higher values of the matter density ( @xmath272 ) , whereas lower values ( @xmath273 ) are preferred by brane2 models ( which generically have @xmath274 ) .",
    "a distinctive feature of the braneworld scenario discussed in this paper is that it allows for a universe which is _",
    "transiently accelerating_. recent investigations indicate that an eternally accelerating universe , which possesses a cosmological event horizon , prevents the construction of a conventional s - matrix describing particle interactions within the framework of string or m - theory @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that braneworld models can enter into a regime of accelerated expansion at late times _ even if _ the brane tension and the bulk cosmological constant are tuned to satisfy the randall  sundrum constraint on the brane . in this case ,",
    "braneworld dark energy and the acceleration of the universe are _ transient _ phenomena . in this class of models , the universe , after the current period of acceleration , re - enters the matter - dominated regime .",
    "we have shown that viable models realising this behaviour are those of brane2 type .",
    "( since these braneworlds have a negative brane tension the question of their stability is important and needs to be examined in detail .",
