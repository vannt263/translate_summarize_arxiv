    "geometrical frustration with strong electronic correlations is one of the main issues in modern condensed - matter physics . in connection with recent experimental studies of frustrated quantum magnets such as those on triangular , kagom@xmath10 ,",
    "spinel and pyrochlore lattices @xcite as well as on triangular structure of @xmath11he on graphite @xcite , hubbard model on lattices with geometrically frustrated structures have been intensively studied @xcite . for example , a quantum spin - liquid feature in the organic material @xmath12-(et)@xmath13cu@xmath13(cn)@xmath14 stimulated the studies on the hubbard model at half - filling on anisotropic triangular lattices @xcite .",
    "another example is the two - dimensional hubbard model with the next - nearest - neighbor hopping , @xmath1 , which will be studied in this paper .",
    "although geometrical frustration tends to suppress conventional magnetic orderings , the properties of the resultant quantum phases and their competitions with other phases are , in many cases , still under discussion .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     here let us compare our results with @xmath15 with those in the @xmath16-@xmath17 heisenberg model on the square lattice .",
    "it has been shown that for @xmath18 , the af state appears and for @xmath19 , the cm state appears @xcite .",
    "since @xmath20 and @xmath21 , these critical values correspond to @xmath22 and @xmath23 which roughly agree with @xmath24 and @xmath25 obtained in the present method . for the intermediate region of @xmath26 ,",
    "no definite conclusion has been drawn on the nature of the ground state of @xmath16-@xmath17 heisenberg model .",
    "possibilities of columnar - dimerized state @xcite , plaquette singlet state @xcite , and resonating - valence - bond state have been discussed .",
    "the intermediate state obtained in our method is a nonmagnetic insulator .",
    "the identification of this state is a remaining future problem .",
    "schmalfu _ et.al .",
    "_ studied the stacked @xmath16-@xmath17 heisenberg model using a coupled - cluster method and rotation - invariant green s function method @xcite .",
    "they showed similar phase diagrams as ours , indicating the desappearance of an intermediate magnetically disordered quantum paramagnetic phase for quite small @xmath27 .",
    "this critical value corresponds to @xmath28 which agree again with fig .",
    "[ fig : pd3 ] .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the role of frustration and dimensionality in the @xmath29-@xmath1 hubbard model on the stacked square lattice given by the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hm1 ] ) , at half - filling and at zero temparature , by changing @xmath1 and @xmath2 . we have employed recently proposed variational cluster approach ( vca ) .",
    "important advantages of vca are that local and off - site short - range correlations are captured exactly , and that broken symmetries are treated with a rigorous dynamical variational principle .",
    "therefore , vca is a powerful method for analyzing magnetic properties of hubbard model with strong electron correlations and geometrical frustration .",
    "our results show that @xmath1 destroys af long - range ordering continuously at small @xmath1 and induces cm long - range ordering at large @xmath1 with the first - order transition .",
    "there is a mi state at intermediate @xmath1 .",
    "we also find that @xmath2 has a tendency to stabilize the magnetic long - range orders and finally mi state vanishes at a critical value of @xmath2 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "therefore , interesting phenomena induced by strong electron correlations and geometrical frustration are very sensitive to dimensionality . in other words , geometrical frustration and low dimensionality have a key role of intriguing physics at least in our model in this study .",
