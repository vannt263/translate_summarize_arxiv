    "the problem of devising global models of nuclidic ( atomic ) masses ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) is of great current interest in connection with experimental studies of nuclei far from stability conducted at heavy - ion and radioactive ion - beam facilities and with the theory of nucleosynthesis and supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of global mass models ranges from those with high theoretical input that explicitly take account of known physical principles in terms of a relatively small number of fitting parameters , to models that are shaped only by the data and thus have a correspondingly large number of adjustable parameters .",
    "current models of the former class that define the state of the art are the finite range droplet model ( frdm ) of mller , nix , and coworkers @xcite and the hartree - fock - bogoliubov model ( hfb2 ) of pearson , tondeur and coworkers @xcite .",
    "statistical models based on neural networks are situated far toward the other end of the spectrum .",
    "they have been under continuing development in recent years , to the extent that they can now provide a valuable complement to conventional global models @xcite .",
    "here we provide a preliminary report of results from a synthesis @xcite of the two approaches .",
    "training by example , a neural network is constructed that estimates the differences @xmath0 between experiment and the frdm , where @xmath1 denotes the nuclidic mass excess . combining the frdm with this neural network , we obtain a hybrid global mass model that performs with precision both in reproducing @xmath1 values for familiar nuclei and predicting them for new nuclei .",
    "this strategy is pursued with the hope of determining whether the residual physical corrections to the frdm model ( a ) stem from a large number of small effects that may fluctuate strongly with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , defying systematic quantification , or instead ( b ) can be attributed in part to regularities of nuclear structure not yet embodied in theory .",
    "a multilayer feedforward architecture is adopted for the neural network , having the structure indicated schematically by ( @xmath4@xmath5@xmath5@xmath5@xmath6)[169 ] .",
    "the four input units encode the atomic number @xmath2 , the neutron number @xmath3 , and their respective parities .",
    "the single output unit encodes the mass - excess difference @xmath7 .",
    "three intermediate layers , each containing six units , transfer information from input to output through weighted connections . the total number of weight parameters charactering the network is 169 . to construct the neural - network model ,",
    "we have employed the database of 1654 nuclei fitted by the frdm parameterization of ref .",
    "@xcite , screening out some uncertain cases in light of the more recent experimental mass - excess assignments published in the 2003 atomic mass evaluation ( ame03 ) @xcite .",
    "the surviving @xmath8 nuclei are divided randomly into two data sets of @xmath9 ( m1 ) and @xmath10 ( m2 ) nuclei , which respectively comprise the learning and validation sets for neural - network modeling .",
    "performance on the learning set serves as the criterion for progressive adjustment of the weights of the feedforward connections , while performance on the validation set is used to guide the termination of training . to obtain an unambiguous measure of predictive performance ,",
    "some of the data must be reserved as a test set , or prediction set , which is never referred to during the training process .",
    "the test set ( denoted m3 ) is provided by the remaining @xmath11 nuclei of the ame03 evaluation .",
    "these data points correspond predominantly to nuclides far from stability , lying on the outer fringes of the @xmath8-nuclide set @xmath12 as viewed in the @xmath13 plane ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the ability of the neural network to model the difference @xmath7 is illustrated in fig .",
    "it is seen that the deviations of the frdm evaluation from experiment for the data sets m1 and m2 involved in the training process can be substantially reproduced by the neural network .",
    "to generate and predict mass - excess values for nuclides of specified @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we construct a hybrid model by combining the frdm outputs with the difference values predicted by the neural - network model described in section 2 . in table 1",
    "we compare performance ( measured by the rms error @xmath14 ) on the learning , validation , and prediction sets for ( i ) the hybrid model , ( ii ) the neural - network mass model of ref .",
    "@xcite and its most recent version @xcite and ( iii ) the theoretical models frdm @xcite and hfb2 @xcite .",
    "the neural - network mass models of refs .",
    "@xcite were trained to directly predict mass - excess values ( as opposed to differences of mass - excess values ) .",
    "likewise , the frdm and hfb2 models were fitted to mass - excess data .",
    "overall , the hybrid model shows the best performance among the four models considered , having very small error figures even for the prediction set m3 .",
    "further insight into the behavior of the hybrid model of mass excess is furnished by fig .  3 , where the rms error of the difference estimate _ per isotope chain _",
    ", i.e. , calculated for all @xmath3 for given @xmath2 , is plotted for the full database @xmath15 . for the majority of chains , the hybrid model yields smaller errors than frdm and hfb2 .",
