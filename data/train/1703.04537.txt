    "while crystals found in nature offer a great richness of phenomena , recent progress in physics has also been driven by the study of engineered systems , where key material parameters or hamiltonian matrix elements can be directly controlled in experiment to give rise to novel emergent properties .",
    "for example , the haldane model for a chern insulator was recently realized in an optical lattice of ultracold atoms @xcite and a weyl semimetal was observed in a photonic crystal with double - gyroid lattice structure @xcite .",
    "each advance required engineering a specific ultracold atom optical lattice or photonic crystal . in both cases , these engineered lattices host an emergent band structure , analogous to the band structure formed by electrons in a crystal lattice , but with distinct properties and highly - tuned parameters that gave rise to a novel phase of matter .    here",
    ", we demonstrate an emergent band structure in a novel type of condensed matter lattice based on topological insulators @xcite .",
    "specifically , we stack together layers of a topological and trivial insulator to create a one - dimensional topological insulator heterostructure .",
    "each interface in the heterostructure hosts a set of topologically - protected interface states which hybridize with each other across the layers , giving rise to a superlattice band structure where the interfaces play the role of lattice sites , the topological surface states play the role of atomic orbitals and the heterostructure acts as a one - dimensional atomic chain .",
    "such a superlattice band structure is emergent in the sense that it arises only when many layers are stacked together , in the same way that an ordinary band structure arises as an emergent property of a crystal lattice . a similar heterostructure has recently been proposed as a simple theoretical model for a dirac or weyl semimetal @xcite . here ,",
    "we experimentally realize and directly observe the first superlattice band structure of this type .",
    "we use molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) to build the topological insulator heterostructure and we use angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) to study its band structure . by adjusting the pattern of layers in the heterostructure , we realize both a topological and a trivial phase , demonstrating that we can tune our system through a topological phase transition .",
    "our work may lead to the realization of novel three - dimensional and one - dimensional symmetry - protected topological phases . at the same time , a topological insulator heterostructure provides a highly - tunable emergent band structure in a true electron system , relevant for transport experiments and device applications .",
    "we first provide a more detailed introduction to the topological insulator heterostructure and argue that our system forms a novel type of condensed matter lattice .",
    "a topological insulator heterostructure is built up of alternating layers of topologically trivial and non - trivial insulators . in this work ,",
    "we use bi@xmath0se@xmath1  as the topological insulator and in@xmath2bi@xmath3se@xmath1  as the trivial insulator , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] a. we note that heterostructures of bi@xmath0se@xmath1  and in@xmath0se@xmath1 have already been successfully synthesized @xcite .",
    "bulk bi@xmath0se@xmath1  has a non - trivial @xmath4 invariant , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "under doping by in , bulk bi@xmath0se@xmath1  undergoes a topological phase transition to a topologically trivial phase with @xmath4 invariant , @xmath6 @xcite . in all samples considered here ,",
    "all in@xmath2bi@xmath3se@xmath1  layers are well into the trivial phase . as a result ,",
    "the topological invariant flips back and forth from layer to layer in the heterostructure , so that each interface hosts a set of topological interface states @xcite .",
    "next , we note that these interface states have a finite penetration depth into the bulk of the crystal , so that for sufficiently thin layers , the topological interface states hybridize with each other across the layers and will be subject to an energy level repulsion @xcite .",
    "this hybridization can be captured by a hopping amplitude @xmath7 across the topological layer and @xmath8 across the trivial layer . in this way",
    ", the topological insulator heterostructure can be viewed as an analog of a polyacetylene chain , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] b , where the topological insulator corresponds to the carbon double bond and the trivial insulator corresponds to the carbon single bond ( or vice versa ) .",
    "we note that our heterostructure is similar to a conventional semiconductor heterostructure in that the band gap varies in @xmath9 , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] c @xcite . however , we see that new phenomena arise in a topological insulator heterostructure because the band gap inverts from layer to layer , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] d. specifically , the hybridization of topological interface states , illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] e , gives rise to a superlattice dispersion . in this way , the topological insulator heterostructure is a novel type of condensed matter lattice , where the interfaces correspond to the atomic sites and the topological insulator interface states correspond to the atomic orbitals . because we can precisely control the thickness of the topological and trivial layers , this superlattice band structure is highly tunable . at the same time , it remains a true electron system , relevant for transport experiments and device applications .",
    "further , if the fermi level can be placed in the bulk band gap , then the underlying bulk bands of each heterostructure layer become irrelevant , and the transport properties are determined only by the superlattice band structure .",
    "this emergent band structure provides a new platform for realizing novel phases in three dimensions , such as a magnetic weyl semimetal @xcite .",
    "further , we note that the energy level repulsion occurs between the electron states at the dirac points , at @xmath10 . as a result",
    ", the system can be well - described as an atomic chain with a two - site basis and one orbital per site , leading to a two - band single - particle hamiltonian . by implementing a chiral symmetry in the layer pattern of the heterostructure , it may be possible to realize a phase with strictly one - dimensional topological invariant protected by chiral symmetry , although further theoretical study may be necessary @xcite .",
    "we note that prior to measurement by arpes , we measure standard core level spectra and diffraction patterns to confirm the high quality of our samples , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] f , g .",
    "we next demonstrate that we have observed an emergent superlattice dispersion in our topological insulator heterostructure .",
    "we present a systematic study of four different bi@xmath0se@xmath1/in@xmath2bi@xmath3se@xmath1  superlattices , which we write as , ,  and , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] a - d . in this notation",

    "[ fig2 ] m - p , we further present the energy distribution curves ( edcs ) of photoemission intensity as a function binding energy at @xmath10 .",
    "these curves correspond to a vertical line on the image plot , indicated by the green arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] i - l . the gapless surface state , labeled ( 1 ) in  and , is entirely inconsistent with a bi@xmath0se@xmath1  film 4ql thick .",
    "it can only be explained by considering hybridization across the in@xmath2bi@xmath3se@xmath1  layer , demonstrating an emergent superlattice band structure arising from hopping of dirac cone interface states within the heterostructure .",
    "in addition , a gap opens from  to  _ without any observable bulk band inversion _ and _ without time - reversal symmetry breaking_. this is an apparent contradiction with the basic theory of @xmath4 topological insulators .",
    "again , this result demonstrates a superlattice dispersion .",
    "as we increase @xmath13 , the top two lattice sites show larger hybridization and a gap opens in the dirac cone on the last site . because arpes is only sensitive to the top surface of the heterostructure , we can not observe the inversion of the superlattice bands , but only the increased coupling to the top surface . our observation of ( 1 ) a gapless surface state on a 4ql film of bi@xmath0se@xmath1  and ( 2 ) a gap opening in a bi@xmath0se@xmath1  surface state without apparent band inversion each demonstrate that we have observed a superlattice dispersion in our system . in this way",
    ", we have shown a completely novel type of electronic band structure , which arises from a lattice of topological insulator dirac cones which are allowed to hybridize .",
    "we provide a one - dimensional picture of the topological and trivial phases of the superlattice .",

    "[ fig3 ] a - d .",
    "above , we argued that  has a gapless dirac cone because @xmath14 .",
    "we note that the different hopping amplitude arises from the large bulk band gap and large thickness of the bi@xmath0se@xmath1  layer relative to the in@xmath2bi@xmath3se@xmath1  layer , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] e. alternatively , we can consider how orbitals pair up and gap out in real space .",
    "we see that in the topological phase , there are two end modes left without a pairing partner , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] f. we contrast the topological phase with the trivial phase observed in , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] g - j . in this case ,",
    "@xmath15 , because the trivial phase has larger band gap than the topological phase , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] k. alternatively , the real space pairing leaves no lattice site without a pairing partner , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] l. we see that our observation of a topological and trivial phase in a topological insulator heterostructure can be understood in terms of an emergent one - dimensional atomic chain where the termination of the chain is either on a strong or weak bond .",
    "we present arpes spectra of other compositions in the topological and trivial phase to provide a systematic check of our results .",

    "[ fig5 ] a. our results can also be understood in terms of a one - dimensional atomic chain terminated on either a strong or weak bond .",
    "it is natural to ask whether any rigorous analogy exists between our topological insulator heterostructure and a one - dimensional topological phase @xcite .",
    "an interesting property of our heterostructure is that it naturally gives rise to an approximate chiral symmetry along the stacking direction .",
    "in particular , because the wavefunction of a topological insulator surface state decays rapidly into the bulk , we expect that the only relevant hybridization in our heterostructure takes place between adjacent interface states .",
    "further , along the stacking direction , the lattice is bipartite . as a result of nearest - neighbor hopping on a bipartite lattice",
    "gives rise to an emergent chiral symmetry along the stacking direction .",
    "we note that chiral symmetry is required for a number of topological phases in one dimension , including the bdi , cii , diii and ci classes , as well as the well - known su - schrieffer - heeger model @xcite .",
    "we suggest that future theoretical work could determine whether a one - dimensional topological phase might be realized in our system .",
    "specifically , we might consider topological invariants on the one - dimensional band structure along @xmath17 at fixed @xmath10 .",
    "we also note that we may introduce a second nearest - neighbor hopping by using even thinner layers , see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] b. this may break the chiral symmetry , removing the one - dimensional topological invariant and shifting the surface state out of the superlattice bulk band gap .",
    "there may further arise an unusual behavior in the surface states if the heterostructure is also characterized by a non - trivial three - dimensional @xmath4 invariant .",
    "another application of our topological insulator heterostructure is to break inversion symmetry using a unit cell consisting of four layers of different thickness , see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] c. this may lead to a superlattice band structure of spinful bands .",
    "more complicated topological insulator heterostructures may allow us to engineer time reversal broken one - dimensional topological phases or large degeneracies implemented by fine - tuning hopping amplitudes .",
