    "interference alignment ( ia ) @xcite is the key ingredient to achieve the optimal degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) for a variety of interference channel models .",
    "the conventional ia framework , however , has several well - known practical challenges : global channel state information ( csi ) and arbitrarily large frequency / time - domain dimension extension .",
    "recently , the concept of opportunistic interference alignment ( oia ) was introduced in @xcite , for the @xmath0-cell single - input multiple - output ( simo ) interfering multiple - access channel ( imac ) , where there are one @xmath1-antenna base station and @xmath2 users in each cell . in the oia scheme for the simo imac ,",
    "@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) users amongst the @xmath2 users are opportunistically selected in each cell in the sense that inter - cell interference is aligned at a pre - defined interference space . even if several studies have independently addressed one or a few of the practical problems  ( see  @xcite ) ,",
    "the oia scheme simultaneously resolves the aforementioned issues .",
    "specifically , the oia scheme operates with i ) local csi acquired via pilot signaling , ii ) no dimension extension in the time / frequency domain , iii ) no iterative optimization of precoders , and iv ) no coordination between the users or the bss .",
    "it has been shown that there exists a trade - off between the the achievable dof and the number of users , which can be characterized by a _ user scaling condition _ @xcite .",
    "similarly , the analysis of the scaling condition of some system parameters required to achieve a target performance have been widely studied to provide a remarkable insight into the convergence rate to the target performance , e.g. , the user scaling condition to achieve target dof for the imac @xcite , the scaling condition of the number of feedback bits to achieve the optimal dof for multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) interference channels @xcite , and the codebook size scaling condition to achieve the target achievable rate for limited feedback mimo systems @xcite . for the simo imac",
    ", the oia scheme asymptotically achieves @xmath5 dof , for @xmath6 , if the number of per - cell users , @xmath2 , scales faster than @xmath7 @xcite , where snr denotes the received signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "note that the optimal dof is achieved when @xmath8 .    for the mimo imac , where each user has @xmath9 antennas , the user scaling condition to achieve @xmath5 dof can be greatly reduced to @xmath10 with the use of singular value decomposition ( svd)-based beamforming at each user , by further minimizing the generating interference level  @xcite .",
    "however , to implement the svd - based oia with local csi and no coordination between the users or the bss , each beamforming weight vector is computed at each user , and then information of the selected users weight vectors should be sent to the corresponding bs for the coherent detection .",
    "in addition , although the oia based on the zero - forcing ( zf ) receiver at the bss is sufficient to achieve the optimal dof , its achievable rate is in general far below the channel capacity , and the gap increases as the dimension of channel matrices grows . in this paper , we would like to answer the aforementioned two practical issues of the svd - based oia . in recent cellular systems such as the 3gpp long term evolution @xcite",
    ", each selected user should transmit an uplink pilot ( known as sounding reference signal in 3gpp systems ) so that the corresponding bs estimates the uplink channel matrix , which is widely used for channel quality estimation , downlink signal design assuming the channel reciprocity in time division duplexing ( tdd ) systems , etc .",
    "the effective channel matrices rotated by the weight vectors should also be known so that the bss perform coherent detection ",
    "the matrices can be acquired by the bss through either of the following two methods : i ) additional dedicated time / frequency pilot ( known as demodulation reference signal in 3gpp systems @xcite ) , where the pilots are rotated by weight vectors @xcite and ii ) limited feedforward of the indices of the weight vectors ( as included in downlink control information format 4 @xcite ) .",
    "for the first method , however , the system capacity can be degraded as the number of selected users increases due to the increased pilot overhead @xcite . for a reliable transmission",
    ", the length of pilot signaling also needs to be sufficiently long  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in cellular networks , long training sequences or disjoint pilot resources for all users in each cell are required to avoid the pilot contamination coming from the inter - cell interference @xcite . for these reasons , practical communication systems such as",
    "the 3gpp standard allow highly limited resources for uplink pilot . on the other hand , the second method using the limited feedforward",
    "is preferable especially for the mimo imac in the sense that feedforward information can be flexibly multiplexed with uplink data requiring no additional pilot resource .",
    "several studies @xcite have addressed the same issues on the feedforward of the weight vectors for multiuser mimo systems , and have proposed the design of codebook - based precoding matrices .    in the first part of this paper",
    ", we introduce a codebook - based oia scheme , where weight vectors are chosen from a pre - defined codebook with a finite size such that information of the weight vectors of selected users is sent to the corresponding bs via limited feedforward signaling .",
    "two widely - used codebooks , the grassmannian and random codebooks , are used .",
    "surprisingly , although the granularity of the grassmannian codebook is higher than that of the random codebook for a given codebook size , our result indicates that for both codebook approaches , the codebook size , required to achieve the same user scaling condition as the svd - based oia case , coincides .",
    "it is also shown that the required codebook size in bits increases linearly with the number of transmit antennas and logarithmically with the received snr , i.e. , the required codebook size scales as @xmath11 .",
    "in the second part , we propose a receiver design at the bss in pursuit of improving the achievable rate based on the zf receiver .",
    "the design is challenging in the sense that local csi and no coordination between any bss are assumed , thus resulting in no available information of the interfering links at each bs .",
    "thus , the maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding is not possible at each bs since the covariance matrix of the effective noise can not be estimated due to no information of the interfering links .",
    "we propose the use of a simple minimum euclidean distance receiver , where the ml cost - function is used by assuming the identity noise covariance matrix , which does not require information of the interfering links .",
    "we show that this receiver asymptotically achieves the channel capacity as the number of users increases .",
    "simulation results are provided to justify the derived user and codebook size scaling conditions and to evaluate the performance of the minimum euclidean distance receiver . a practical scenario , e.g. , low snr , small codebook size , and a small number of users , is taken into account to show the robustness of our scheme .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "in fact , our result is consistent with the previous work on limited feedback systems ( see  @xcite ) , where the performance gap between two codebooks was shown to be negligible as the number of feedback bits increases .    for the mimo broadcasting channel with limited feedback , where the transmitter has @xmath9 antennas employing the random codebook , it was shown in  @xcite that the achievable rate loss for each user , denoted by @xmath183 , coming from the finite size of the codebook is given by @xmath184 .",

    "the main challenge is thus to decode the desired symbols with no csi of the cross - links at the receivers . for convenience ,",
