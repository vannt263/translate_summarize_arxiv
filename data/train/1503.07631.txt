    "the purpose of this article is to present the virtual fundamental chain technique and its application to the moduli space of pseudo - holomorphic curves , in as much detail as possible .",
    "the technique of virtual fundamental cycles and chains was invented in the year 1996 by groups of mathematicians @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and applied to many purposes subsequently .",
    "several references such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite provide various versions and details of this technique .    in this article",
    "( besides various improvement of the detail of the proof , presentation etc . )",
    "we add the following points to our earlier writing @xcite of similar nature .    1 .",
    "we present the detail of the chain level argument , especially in the de - rham version .",
    "we provide a package of the statements which arise from the virtual fundamental chain and cycle technique , in the way one can directly quote and use without referring to their proofs .",
    "we give constructions of algebraic structures from systems of spaces with kuranishi structures .",
    "we separate the topological and algebraic issues from analytic ones of the story so that this part of the construction can be rigorously stated and proved without referring to the construction of such system .",
    "4 .   we discuss in detail the construction of a system of spaces with kuranishi structures that satisfies the axioms we mentioned in item ( 3 ) .",
    "compared to @xcite , we put more emphasis on the consistency of kuranishi structures we obtain .",
    "namely our emphasis lies in the construction of such a system of kuranishi structures rather than that of a single kuranishi structure .",
    "we also provide details of the proof of certain fundamental properties of gromov - witten invariants . in this article",
    "we clarify the fact that we can work out this proof without using continuous family of perturbations .",
    "in other words , we need only the technique that already appeared in @xcite but not those developed in the later literature .",
    "we also explain a method of working with the @xmath1-coefficient without using a triangulation of the perturbed moduli space .",
    "this is possible if we only need to study moduli space of virtual dimension 0,1 and negative .",
    "note that these cases handle all the applications appearing in @xcite .",
    "this article is divided into three parts .",
    "part 1 studies space with kuranishi structure .",
    "here we consider only single space with kuranishi structure and not its system .",
    "we also write part 1 ( and part 2 ) so that it can be read without any knowledge of pseudo - holomorphic curves .",
    "especially readers knowledge on analytic details on pseudo - holomorphic curves is not required .",
    "occasionally we mention the moduli space of pseudo - holomorphic curves in parts 1 and 2 , but none of the proof relies on them .",
    "this is because we do so only at the place where we think some motivation of the construction or the definition etc",
    ". would be useful .",
    "we believe that for the reader whose background is more on topology and/or algebra but not on analysis , this way of writing is useful .",
    "we also believe that our writing clarifies the fact that problem of transversality of the moduli space of pseudo - holomorphic curves lies in the realm of differential topology rather than one in functional or nonlinear analysis .    item ( 1 ) mentioned above comprises part 1 .",
    "in part 2 we study systems of kuranishi structures and provide a systematic way of building algebraic structures on certain chain complex arising from such a system .",
    "we discuss the case of floer homology ( of periodic hamiltonian system ) and of @xmath3 algebra appearing in lagrangian floer theory .",
    "item ( 3 ) above comprises part 2 .",
    "in part 3 we present in detail the construction of the moduli spaces of pseudo - holomorphic curves and its kuranishi structure which satisfies the axioms we formulate in part 2 .",
    "we discuss them for the case of floer homology ( of periodic hamiltonian system ) and of @xmath3 algebra appearing in lagrangian floer theory .",
    "we also discuss the case of gromov - witten invariants .",
    "( item ( 5 ) is in part 3 . )",
    "we remark parts 1 and 2 of this article are self - contained .",
    "it does not use the results of @xcite .",
    "in other words , we reprove certain parts of @xcite in this article .",
    "( we quote some general topology issue from @xcite . ) in part 3 , we quote @xcite in several places .",
    "introduction to each part follows .",
    "now we upload part 1 . in the text below we quote results , sections etc . of parts 2 and 3 .",
    "they will appear later on .",
    "note we quote parts 2 and 3 in order to provide a view how the results of part 1 are used or to provide perspective to related results .",
    "as far as the logic of the proof concerns , the discussion of part 1 is complete without referring parts 2 and 3 .",
    "[ sec : introduction ]      in part 1 we discuss the space with kuranishi structure and define its virtual fundamental chain .",
    "kuranishi structure is a ` generalization of the notion of manifold which allows singularity ' .",
    "we entirely work in @xmath4-category . in general , singularity in @xmath4-category",
    "can be much wilder than one in analytic category .",
    "our aim is not developing a general theory of ` @xmath4 analogue of scheme ' but a more restricted one , which is , to define virtual fundamental chains and cycles . because of this , our definitions and constructions are designed so that they are useful for that particular purpose .",
    "now an outline of the main results proved in part 1 is in order . since most basic and conceptual ideas behind the definitions of kuranishi structures and virtual fundamental chains",
    "have been explained in various other previous writings of ours ( see @xcite @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section a1 ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 12 ) @xcite for example ) , here we discuss more technical aspect of the story , that is , the way how we rigorously realize those basic concepts . in fact the aim of this article is _ not _ to explain the basic concepts of the theory or to present the main ideas of the construction of virtual fundamental chains ( which , according to the opinion of the authors of this article , is definitely more important than the details provided here ) but to present its _ technical _ details with as much details as possible    roughly speaking kuranishi structure of a space @xmath5 represents @xmath5 locally as a zero set @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a section of vector bundle @xmath8 over an orbifold @xmath9 . more precisely a kuranishi chart is a quadruple @xmath10 where @xmath7 is a section of a vector bundle @xmath8 over an orbifold @xmath9 and @xmath11 is a homeomorphism to its image .",
    "( see definition [ kuranishineighborhooddef ] . )",
    "we call @xmath7 a _ kuranishi map_. in fact this description in the situation of various applications appears as a kuranishi model of the local description of the moduli problem . we also need appropriate notion of coordinate changes among them .    the main difference of the coordinate change between kuranishi charts from the coordinate change between manifold or orbifold charts lies in the fact that the coordinate change of kuranishi charts may not be a local ` isomorphism ' .",
    "this is because the dimension of the space with kuranishi structure is , by definition , @xmath12 and so the orbifolds @xmath13 of two kuranishi charts",
    "@xmath14 of the same space @xmath5 may have different dimension .",
    "( namely @xmath15 in general . )",
    "recall that in the description of the manifold or orbifold structure one uses a pseudo - group or a groupoid .",
    "this description certainly is _ not _ useful for the kuranishi structure since the most important axiom of groupoid ( the invertibility of the morphisms ) is exactly the one we give up .",
    "one may use a version of category of fractions to invert the arrows appearing in the definition of coordinate change of kuranishi charts to adapt the groupoid language .",
    "this is the route taken , for example , by d. joyce in @xcite , which however is not the one we take .",
    "there are two slightly different versions of the definition of ` spaces with kuranishi type structures ' in @xcite .",
    "one is what we call ` a kuranishi structure ' the other ` a good coordinate system ' .    in the manifold theory ( or in the orbifold theory )",
    "we consider a maximal set of the coordinate charts compatible with one another , and call this set a structure of @xmath4 manifold .",
    "equivalently for a manifold @xmath16 we assign a ( germ of a ) coordinate neighborhood to each point @xmath17 of @xmath16 .",
    "this way of defining the manifold structure is somehow more canonical . on the other hand to perform various operations using the given manifold structure , we usually take a locally finite cover consisting of coordinate charts in the given manifold structure .",
    "the latter is especially necessary when we use a partition of unity as in the case of defining integration of differential form on a manifold @xmath16 .",
    "certain amount of general topology is needed to be worked out in the manifold course to prove existence of an appropriate locally finite cover extracted from the set of infinitely many charts defining the manifold structure .",
    "this technicality is not entirely trivial but is never a conceptual heart of the theory .",
    "the relationship between the kuranishi structure and the good coordinate system is similar to the one between these two ways of describing a @xmath4 structure of manifolds .",
    "a kuranishi structure of @xmath5 assigns a kuranishi chart @xmath18 to each point @xmath19 .",
    "so in particular it contains uncountably many charts .",
    "on the other hand , a good coordinate system of @xmath5 consists of locally finite ( finite if @xmath5 is compact ) kuranishi charts @xmath20 .",
    "( @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 is certain index set . )",
    "note coordinate changes between kuranishi charts are not necessarily a local isomorphism . in general",
    "we have coordinate change only in one direction . in the case of kuranishi structure the coordinate change from @xmath23 to @xmath24 is defined only when @xmath25 .",
    "( here @xmath26 is a neighborhood of @xmath17 . )",
    "we remark that @xmath27 does not imply @xmath28 .",
    "in the case of good coordinate system the set of kuranishi charts is parameterized by a certain partially ordered set @xmath22 and the coordinate change from @xmath29 to @xmath20 is defined only when @xmath30 .",
    "( chen - tian s approach ) in the paper @xcite ( and several other references which follow chen - tian s approach ) the set of charts are parameterized by a subset of certain finite set @xmath31 .",
    "( namely @xmath32 . ) the partial order in chen - tian s approach is the usual inclusion of subsets .",
    "( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 2.1 ) . )",
    "if we examine the proof of the construction of kuranishi structure in @xcite , we find that the partially ordered set which appears there is actually parameterized by a subset of certain subset of the moduli space .",
    "( namely @xmath31 is a finite subset of @xmath5 . )",
    "thus our approach is not so far away from chen - tian s approach in applications .",
    "we , however , think our way of including arbitrary partially ordered set is more flexible than chen - tian s .",
    "( their approach certainly works at least for their purpose . )    for example the approach using @xmath32 does not seem to work literally in the case when we try to construct a system of kuranishi structures on moduli spaces of pseudo - holomorphic curves ( without boundary ) so that it is consistent with the fiber product description of the stratum .",
    "( see part 3 . )",
    "one can certainly modify or use its variant to include that case .",
    "however modifying the definition when new applications appear is not a good way to develop general theory , especially such a lengthy one we are building . because then one need either to repeat all the proofs again or to say ` we can prove it in the same way ' . in this article",
    "we want to avoid saying this sentence as much as possible though it might be impossible to completely avoid it .",
    "the structure of partially ordered set is certainly the structure which remains in all the expected generalizations and is also the very structure we need for the inductive argument we will use to work on good coordinate system .",
    "the main reason why the notion of kuranishi structure was introduced is to work out the transversality issue appearing in the theory of pseudo - holomorphic curves and etc . for this purpose",
    "it is important to perturb the kuranishi map , denoted by @xmath7 , so that the resulting perturbed map becomes transversal to @xmath33 .",
    "the original proof of transversality theorem due to r. thom @xcite constructed perturbation by using induction on charts .",
    "we follow this proof .",
    "we use partial order on the index set @xmath22 of kuranishi charts for this purpose . note in order to perform this inductive construction it is essential to use good coordinate system rather than kuranishi structure since it is hard to work on uncountably many coordinate charts consisting kuranishi structure .",
    "thus construction of good coordinate system out of kuranishi structure is an important step in the construction of an appropriate perturbation and resolving transversality issue .    on the other hand",
    ", the fact that the kuranishi structure is more canonical than the good coordinate system can be seen from the following point .",
    "we can define the product of two spaces with kuranishi structure in a canonical way .",
    "however the definition of product of two spaces with good coordinate system is more complicated and is less natural . for our application",
    "we need to construct virtual fundamental chains in the way that is compatible with fiber product or with direct product . for this purpose working with kuranishi structure",
    "is more appropriate .",
    "thus during the various constructions , we need to go from a kuranishi structure to a good coordinate system and back several times .",
    "concerning this transition from one to the other , there is one difference between the current story and the manifold theory . in the manifold theory ,",
    "one starts with a @xmath4 structure ( which consists of all the compatible coordinate charts ) and then pick up an appropriate locally finite cover .",
    "it is a fact that one can always recover original @xmath4 structure from the charts consisting of the chosen locally finite cover . in the current story of kuranishi structures ,",
    "we start with a kuranishi structure @xmath34 and construct a compatible good coordinate system @xmath35 .",
    "we can use the resulting good coordinate system @xmath35 to construct another kuranishi structure @xmath36 .",
    "unfortunately @xmath36 is different from @xmath34 in general . in other words",
    "we lose certain information while we go from a kuranishi structure to its associated good coordinate system .",
    "some portion of the discussion in part 1 is devoted to showing that this loss does not affect the construction of virtual fundamental chain .",
    "this technical trouble seems to reflect the fact that the notion of kuranishi structure is conceptually less canonical than that of manifold .",
    "for example we can construct a kuranishi structure on ( practically all the ) moduli spaces of pseudo - holomorphic curves .",
    "however the kuranishi structure we obtain is not unique but depends on some choices .",
    "( we compensate this shortcoming by using an appropriate notion of cobordism . ) in case the moduli space happens to be a manifold ( and the equation defining the moduli space is fredholm regular ) the @xmath4 structure on the moduli space is certainly canonical .",
    "another sign that the notion of kuranishi structure is not canonical enough is that we do not know how to define a morphism between two spaces with kuranishi structure .",
    "it seems that the route taken by joyce @xcite , @xcite resolves these two issues .",
    "see remark [ joycerem ] for the reason why we nevertheless use our definitions of kuranishi structure and good coordinate system .",
    "the history of the 20 century mathematics tells us that in the realm of algebro - geometric or complex analytic category , going to the ultimatum in making all the constructions , definitions and etc .",
    "as canonical as possible is often the correct point of view even if it looks cumbersome at the beginning .",
    "it also tells us that in the realm of differential geometry or in that of @xmath4 functions , an attempt to realize a canonical construction in the ultimate level frequently fails functions is one typical example . ]",
    "and so we are forced to find the suitable place to compromise and to be content ourselves with being able to achieve the particular purpose we pursue .",
    "the whole exposition of part 1 is designed in the way that most of the statements and proofs find their analogs in the corresponding statements and proofs of the standard theory of manifolds .",
    "once the right statements are given , the proofs are fairly obvious most of the times , although it is not entirely so because there are also some differences between the kuranishi structure and the manifold structure in certain technical points . these differences result in cumbersome and technically heavy proofs in those cases .",
    "however we emphasize that these are rather technical points and do not comprise the conceptional heart of the theory .",
    "especially for the researchers who have in their mind the construction of virtual fundamental chains in various concrete geometric problems , thorough understanding of cumbersome details of these technicality should not be a part of everyone s required background .",
    "it seems to us that the whole theory now becomes nontrivial only because its presentation is heavy and lengthy .",
    "the method of making the proof ` locally trivial ' , which we are taking here , has been used in various branches of mathematics as an established method for building the foundation of a new theory , especially when the theory is conceptually simple but meets certain complicated technicality in its rigorous details .",
    "we choose the ` bourbaki style ' way of writing this article .",
    "especially , we do our best effort to make explicit the assumptions we work with and the conclusions we obtain . as its consequence , there appear so many definitions and statements in the text , which we acknowledge is annoying but may be inevitable .",
    "we hope that in the near future many users of virtual techniques via the kuranishi structure appreciate that they do not need to know anything more than a small number of basic definitions and theorems together with the fact that the story of kuranishi structure is mostly similar to that of smooth manifolds",
    ". then one can safely dispose the details such as those we provide here and use the conclusions as a ` black box ' .",
    "it is the present authors opinion that advent of such an enlightening and agreement in the area will be important for the development of symplectic geometry and related fields . in fact , one main obstacle to its smooth development has been the nuisance of working out similar , but not precisely the same , details each time when one tries to use the moduli spaces of pseudo - holomorphic curves of various kinds in various situations .",
    "now we provide description of the main results of part 1 sectionwise . in section",
    "[ sec : skuraterm ] , we give the definitions of kuranishi structures ( definition [ kstructuredefn ] ) and good coordinate systems ( definition [ gcsystem ] ) .",
    "these definitions are based on a version of the definitions of an orbifold , its embedding and a vector bundle on it , which we describe in section [ sec : ofd ] .",
    "of course the basic concepts and the mathematical contents of orbifold were established long time ago @xcite .",
    "however there are a few different ways of defining an orbifold in the technical point of view .",
    "more significantly , the notion of morphisms between orbifolds is rather delicate to define .",
    "we refer readers to the discussion of the book @xcite especially its section 1 for these points . in this article ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the world of effective orbifolds and use only embeddings as maps between them .",
    "then those delicate points and troubles disappear .    in section",
    "[ sec : fiber ] , we define the fiber and the direct product of spaces with kuranishi structure .",
    "we remark that in the category theory the notion of fiber product is defined in purely abstract language of objects and morphisms . the definition of fiber product we give in this section , however , is _ not _ the one given in the category theory .",
    "in fact , we never define the notion of morphisms between spaces equipped with kuranishi structure in general .",
    "therefore we define a fiber product of spaces with kuranishi structure directly in section [ sec : fiber ] . here",
    "we consider only the fiber product over a manifold and require an appropriate transversality to define a fiber product .",
    "although the definition we provide is not in the sense of category theory , they are so natural and canonical that the basic properties expected for the fiber product are fairly manifest . for example",
    ", associativity of the fiber product follows rather immediately from its definition .",
    "we do not define a fiber or a direct product of spaces with good coordinate systems here since its definition necessarily becomes more technical and complicated .",
    "in this article we assume all the kuranishi structures and good coordinate systems are oriented ( definitions [ kuraorient ] and [ gcsystem ] ) unless otherwise mentioned .    in section [ sec : thick ]",
    "we discuss the process going from a kuranishi structure to a good coordinate system and back . as we mentioned before , we start from a kuranishi structure @xmath34 and construct a good coordinate system @xmath35 as follows .    * theorem [ them71restate ] . *",
    "_ for any kuranishi structure @xmath34 of @xmath37 there exist a good coordinate system @xmath38 of @xmath37 and a kg - embedding @xmath39 .",
    "_    see definition [ defn32020202 ] for kg - embedding .",
    "( the good coordinate system @xmath38 above is said to be _ compatible _ with the kuranishi structure @xmath34 . )",
    "we also start from a good coordinate system @xmath35 and construct a kuranishi structure @xmath40 .",
    "( proposition [ lemappgcstoku ] . ) when @xmath40 is obtained from @xmath34 by combining these two processes , the kuranishi structure @xmath40 is in general different from @xmath34 but @xmath40 is related to @xmath34 in a way that @xmath40 is a thickening of @xmath34 .",
    "we define this notion of thickening and study its properties in section [ sec : thick ] .    to formulate the notion of compatibility between a kuranishi structure and a good coordinate system , and compatibility among kuranishi structures or among good coordinate systems ,",
    "we use the notion of embeddings .",
    "we define 4 possible versions of such embeddings and their compositions ( there are 8 possible versions of compositions ) in section [ sec : thick ] .",
    "see tables 5.1 and 5.2 . in section [ sec : contgoodcoordinate ] , the proof of basic results of existence of good coordinate system compatible with given kuranishi structure ( theorem [ them71restate ] ) is given .    in section",
    "[ sec : multisection ] , we define the notion of multisections and multi - valued perturbations and their transversality .",
    "the basic result is the following existence theorem of transversal perturbation , which is proved in section [ sec : constrsec]. here we leave the precise definitions of the terminology used in the statement to the later text .    * theorem [ prop621 ] . *",
    "_ let @xmath38 be a good coordinate system of @xmath37 and @xmath41 its support system . _    1 .",

    "2 .   suppose @xmath45 is strongly smooth and is transversal to @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a map from a manifold @xmath16 .",
    "then we may choose @xmath48 such that @xmath49 is strongly transversal to @xmath47 with respect to @xmath48 .",
    "a technical but nontrivial result we prove in section [ sec : multisection ] is compactness of the zero set of a multi - valued perturbation , which is a part of corollary [ cor69 ] .",
    "corollary [ cor69 ] also claims the fact that the zero set of multi - valued perturbation converges to the zero set of the kuranishi map in hausdorff topology as our perturbation converges to the kuranishi map .",
    "( we remark that the zero set of the kuranishi map is nothing but the space @xmath5 itself on which we define our good coordinate system . ) these and other related results play an important role to work out the technical detail of the proof of well - defined - ness of the virtual fundamental chain ( propositions [ indepofukuracont ] and [ prop14777 ] ) .",
    "we remark that in section [ sec : multisection ] we work on a space with good coordinate system and not on a space with kuranishi structure . as we mentioned before",
    ", we use an induction over the charts in the construction of a transversal multisection .",
    "this induction works with the good coordinate system but not with the kuranishi structure itself .    in section [ sec : contfamily ] ,",
    "we define the notion of continuous family perturbation ( abbreviated as cf - perturbation ) and study their properties in relation to the good coordinate systems and the integration over the fiber .",
    "we use this notion to define the integration of differential forms on the space with good coordinate system .",
    "( moreover we also define the integration along the fiber . )",
    "the framework with which we define the integration along the fiber of differential form is as follows .",
    "( see also situation [ smoothcorr ] . )",
    "[ situ13 ] we consider @xmath5 , @xmath16 , @xmath35 , @xmath50 with the following properties .    1 .",
    "we are given a good coordinate system @xmath51 of a space @xmath5 .",
    "we are given submersions @xmath52 to a manifold @xmath16 such that they are compatible with the coordinate change in an appropriate sense .",
    "( namely we assume that there is a weakly submersive map @xmath53 . )",
    "( definition [ mapkura].)@xmath54    we next define the notion of continuous family perturbation ( cf - perturbation ) .",
    "we do so in 2 steps .",
    "we first define such notion on a single chart @xmath55 .",
    "we then discuss its compatibility with coordinate change and use it to define the notion of cf - perturbation of a good coordinate system .",
    "we define the notion of differential form on the space with good coordinate system .",
    "( it assigns a differential form on @xmath56 to each @xmath21 which are compatible with coordinate changes .",
    "see definition [ defndiffformgcs ] . )",
    "we use them to define integration along the fiber @xmath57 for any sufficiently small @xmath58 . here",
    "the degree @xmath59 is @xmath60 and @xmath61 is a cf - perturbation , which satisfies an appropriate transversality assumption .",
    "( more precisely we assume that @xmath50 is strongly submersive with respect to @xmath61 .",
    "see definition [ smoothfunctiononvertk ] . )    in the case when @xmath62 is a manifold or an orbifold ( that is , when all the obstruction bundles @xmath63 are trivial ) , the operation ( [ intalongfiber ] ) reduces to the standard integration along the fiber of a differential form .",
    "note @xmath61 is a one - parameter family of perturbations parameterized by @xmath64 .",
    "the integration along the fiber _ does _ depend on @xmath65 as well as cf - perturbation .",
    "we also remark that typically ( [ intalongfiber ] ) diverges as @xmath65 goes to @xmath33 .",
    "we firmly believe there is _ no _ way of defining the integration along the fiber in the way independent of the choice of cf - perturbation .",
    "this is related to the following most basic point of the whole story of virtual fundamental chains :    in the case we need to construct a virtual fundamental _ chain _ but _ not a cycle _ , that is , as in the case when our ( moduli ) space has a boundary or a corner , the virtual fundamental chain depends on the choice of perturbations .",
    "however we can make ( many ) choices in a consistent way so that the resulting algebraic system is independent of such choices modulo certain homotopy equivalence .",
    "we will discuss this point further in part 2 .",
    "on the other hand , the integration along the fiber ( [ intalongfiber ] ) is independent of various other choices involved .",
    "especially it is independent of the choice of partition of unity we use to define the integration .",
    "we define the partition of unity in definition [ pounity ] in the current context and prove its existence in proposition [ pounitexi ] .",
    "the above mentioned independence is proved as proposition [ indepofukuracont ] .    in section [ sec : stokes ] we prove stokes formula for the integration along the fiber ( [ intalongfiber ] ) .",
    "we begin with discussing the boundary of a space with kuranishi structure or with good coordinate system .",
    "we can define the notion of a boundary @xmath66 of a manifold with corners @xmath16 , which we call the normalized boundary .",
    "@xmath66 is again a manifold with corner and there is a map @xmath67 which is generically one to one and is a surjection to the boundary of @xmath16 .",
    "set theoretically @xmath66 is not a subset of @xmath16 .",
    "for example , codimension 2 corner points of @xmath16 appear twice in @xmath66 .",
    "these issues are not deep and are basically well - known . because a systematic discussion of these issues is not easy to find and also because they are needed for a systematic study of kuranishi structure with corner , which is important for the chain level argument ( especially those appearing in part 2 ) , we include a systematic discussion of these issues here . once these points are understood for the case of manifolds , it is straightforward to generalize them to the kuranishi structure or to the good coordinate system with boundary and corners .",
    "stokes formula in this context is ( [ stokesinintro ] ) given below . in situation [ situ13 ] , suppose @xmath62 has normalized boundary , @xmath68 .",
    "we assume the restriction @xmath69 of @xmath50 to @xmath70 is still weakly submersive .",
    "suppose also we are given a cf - perturbation @xmath61 of @xmath62 .",
    "we assume @xmath50 is strongly submersive with respect to @xmath61 .",
    "then @xmath61 induces a cf - perturbation @xmath71 on the boundary with respect to which the restriction @xmath69 of @xmath50 is strongly submersive .",

    "we however use our version of kuranishi structure and good coordinate system in this article .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "our goal is to define a system of operators from a system of smooth correspondences ( which is the object such as situation [ situ1665 ] ( 1)(2 ) ) .",
    "we need to choose a chain model on which we realize our operations forming the algebraic structure .",
    "our choice in this article is the de rham complex .",
    "( in some other occasion we also use the singular chain complex . )",
    "note the space @xmath5 which has kuranishi structure may have pathological topology in general .",
    "so singular homology does not behave nicely for @xmath5 . in the case of de rham model",
    ", the situation gets even worse .",
    "namely it seems impossible to define the notion of differential forms on @xmath5 .. ]    thus , we need to take a union of charts of @xmath5 which has a positive size to work with de rham or singular homology .",
    "namely we need a system of spaces @xmath56 which is a manifold or orbifold and containing @xmath5 .",
    "both singular homology and de rham cohomology of such spaces behave nicely .",
    "we remark that to define the notion of differential forms of a good coordinate system or of kuranishi structure , we need compatibility of coordinate change in our sense , that is stronger than joyce assumed in @xcite .",
    "namely , we also need to assume compatibility at some points outside @xmath5 ( i.e. , outside the zero set of kuranishi map @xmath7 ) . by this reason",
    ", it seems that we can use neither de rham cohomology nor singular homology directly if we use the definition of kuranishi structure in the sense of @xcite .",
    "as far as we understand , joyce s plan is to use a version of kuranishi homology ( @xcite ) as the cohomology theory which makes sense in his version of kuranishi structure .",
    "it seems likely that this approach works .",
    "one potential trouble however is the poincar duality .",
    "joyce in @xcite provides a chain level intersection paring .",
    "however the intersection ` number ' in his chain level intersection paring is not a number but is an element of some huge complex ( whose cohomology group is @xmath1 ) . though this construction provides the same amount of information in the homology level",
    "there is a trouble using it for the chain level argument .",
    "while we work on the chain level argument , sometimes we need to convert some input variables ( of algebraic operation we will obtain ) to output variables .",
    "we use the ( chain level ) poincar duality for this purpose . note the pairing @xmath197 works in the chain level in de rham theory .",
    "this identifies an element of de rham complex with an element in its dual .",
    "although the dual space of the space of differential forms is the set of distributions and is different from the set of differential forms , the difference between the spaces of differential forms and of distributions is relatively small so that we can still use the chain level poincar duality to convert certain input variables to output variables .",
    "it seems that to realize this poinca duality in the situation of kuranishi homology , one needs to work more on the side of homological algebra .",
    "the amount of algebraic work to be done for this purpose might be very heavy , although it is plausible .",
