    "the problem of determining whether a two generator real mbius group acting on the poincar plane ( hyperbolic two - space ) is or is not discrete is an old one . if such a group is non - elementary and discrete , it is , of course , a fuchsian group .",
    "there are many approaches to this problem , some of them incomplete .",
    "one of the most complete answers is given by the use of an algorithm .",
    "the algorithm can be given in a number of different forms @xcite , including a geometric form and an algebraic form .",
    "revisiting the algorithm has been productive , as the algorithm has been shown to have a number of useful implications , including results about primitives and palindromes in rank two free groups , discreteness criteria for complex mbius groups acting on hyperbolic three space , and the computational complexity of the discreteness problem @xcite . in this paper",
    "we revisit the gilman - maskit algorithm @xcite in the case of a pair of hyperbolic generators @xmath0 and @xmath1 with disjoint axes and illustrate that it is a type of _ non - euclidean euclidean algorithm_. we refer to the gilman - maskit geometric form of the algorithm as the gm algorithm or as the geometric algorithm or simply as the algorithm .    an algorithm is termed a non - euclidean euclidean algorithm if it involves performing euclidean algorithm type calculations to quantities that are non - euclidean lengths , in particular to the translation lengths , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , of the isometries when they ( or a conjugate pair ) act as hyperbolic isometries on the poincar plane .",
    "the algorithms in @xcite can also be viewed as algorithms to find the three shortest geodesic when the group is discrete .",
    "the paper @xcite addresses the case of intersecting hyperbolic axes .",
    "we point out how the concept of the non - euclidean euclidean algorithm applies to all types of pairs of isometries acting on hyperbolic two - space as such a shortest length algorithm even where no algorithm is needed to determine discreteness ( e.g. as in the case of two hyperbolic generators with intersecting axes and a hyperbolic commutator ) .",
    "this is done in section [ section : all ] .    a quick heuristic way to understand the term _ non - euclidean euclidean algorithm _",
    "( an nee algorithm ) is by referring to the description given by ryan hoban @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : manshadow ] ) .",
    "the main theorems , theorem [ theorem : new ] and its companion theorem [ theorem : pars ] , are stated in section [ section : main ] using a minimal amount of notation and background material .",
    "in fact although some notation and terminology is given in section [ section : note ] , most of section [ section : main ] can be read without this . in section [ section : not ] further notation is set and terminology reviewed .",
    "this section includes subsections on factoring and the algorithmic paths . in section [ section : barebones ] we give a barebones description of the geometric algorithm together with figures illustrating the geometry of some of the cases we need to consider .",
    "the proofs of the main theorems along with the relevant lemmas and their proofs are in section [ section : mainlemma ] . at the end of this section theorem [ theorem : new ] and",
    "its companion theorem [ theorem : pars ] are combined into a single theorem , theorem [ theorem : hp ] . in section [ section : analogy ] the analogy",

    "we begin by summarizing standard results about mbius transformations acting on the poincar plane ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath4 be a mbius transformation in @xmath5 and @xmath6 one of the two matrices in @xmath7 that projects to @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath6 is termed a pull back of @xmath4 or equivalently a lift of @xmath4 .",
    "now @xmath6 acts as a fractional linear transformation on the extended complex plane @xmath8 . since @xmath6 and its negative induce the same action as fractional linear transformations",
    ", @xmath4 also acts as a fractional linear transformation .",
    "elements of @xmath7 fix the upper - half plane , @xmath9 and act as isometries when @xmath10 is endowed with the with the poincar metric . similarly complex fractional linear transformations that fix the unit disc , @xmath11 , act as isometries on the unit disc model for hyperbolic space .",
    "now @xmath10 is mapped onto @xmath11 by the transformation @xmath12 and this transformation induces a map from the poincar metric on the upper - half - plane to the poincar metric on the unit disc .",
    "conjugation by the matrix @xmath13 sends the matrices in @xmath7 to matrices that give isometries in the unit disc model and preserves traces .",
    "since @xmath4 and @xmath14 induce the same isometry , we use them interchangeably .    as conjugates of @xmath4 and @xmath14",
    "act as isometries in the unit disc model , we move from the upper - half - plane model to the unit disc model according to convenience using @xmath4 for the element acting in either model and @xmath15 for the metric in either model .",
    "we remind the reader of the classification of isometries acting on @xmath10 _ algebraically _ by the absolute value of the trace of the pull back .",
    "the matrix @xmath14 and the isometry induced by @xmath4 or @xmath6 is hyperbolic , elliptic or parabolic according to whether @xmath16 , the absolute value of the trace of the matrix , is @xmath17 .",
    "if we begin with @xmath0 and @xmath1 in @xmath18 and choose @xmath19 and @xmath20 to have positive trace , then the trace of every element @xmath6 in the group they generate is determined and we set @xmath21 .",
    "a transformation fixing @xmath11 is hyperbolic , parabolic or elliptic according to whether its conjugate acting on @xmath10 is .    if @xmath4 is hyperbolic , it fixes two points on the boundary of the @xmath10 and the hyperbolic geodesic connecting the two fixed points known as the axis of @xmath4 and denoted @xmath22 .",
    "one of the fixed points is attracting and one is repelling .",
    "this means that @xmath4 moves points along the axis of @xmath4 toward the attracting fixed point and it moves all points on @xmath22 a fixed distance in the non - euclidean metric , its translation length , @xmath23 . the same statements apply to the conjugate of @xmath4 acting on @xmath11 .",
    "any two geodesics have a unique common perpendicular . if a geodesic is oriented , then with respect to the positive orientation , there is a left and a right of the geodesic",

    "if @xmath27 and if the attracting fixed points of @xmath0 and @xmath1 lie to the left of @xmath24 , then we say that the ordered pair @xmath28 is _ coherently oriented_. after interchanging @xmath0 and @xmath1 and replacing @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 by their inverses , we may always assume that we have a coherently oriented pair .",
    "given @xmath0 and @xmath1 exactly one of @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a coherently oriented pair .",
    "we term this the _ related coherently oriented pair_.",
    "we let @xmath31 be the group generated by @xmath0 and @xmath1 both elements of @xmath18 and assume throughout this paper that @xmath31 is non - elementary .",
    "the results of @xcite can be summarized as    [ theorem : gmalg ] @xcite * ( geometric algorithm ) * let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be hyperbolic elements of @xmath18 .",
    "interchange @xmath0 and @xmath1 so that @xmath32 and replacing @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 its inverse if necessary to assume that the pair @xmath28 is coherently oriented .",

    "further in the investigation of the computational complexity of the gm algorithm ( @xcite ) , upper bounds for the integers @xmath37 are found , but the integers themselves are not computed . in this paper , we actually compute the integers .",

    "an algorithm is a procedure that always stops and gives an answer .",
    "the proof of the existence of a geometric algorithm ( an algorithm as opposed to a procedure ) to determine discreteness or non - discreteness proceeds using jrgensen s inequality to obtain a positive lower bound for the difference between the trace of @xmath0 and that of @xmath38 when the pair @xmath28 is coherently oriented@xcite .",
    "thus in replacing a pair @xmath28 by @xmath39 we can show that we have decreased the trace by a positive amount .",
    "the concept of trace minimizing is due to purzitsky and has been further developed by purzitsky and rosenberger @xcite .",
    "we first state the main result in the case that the initial and stopping generators are hyperbolic isometries with disjoint axes as this is the most complicated case of the algorithm and then give extensions allowing parabolics ; in section [ section : all ] we indicate how this extends to all other type of pairs of initial and stopping generators .",
