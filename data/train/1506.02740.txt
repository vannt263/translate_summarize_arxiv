    "flash memory is a non - volatile storage medium both electrically programmable and erasable .",
    "it is currently widely used due to its reliability , high storage density and relatively low cost .",
    "it incorporates a set of cells maintained at a set of levels of charge to encode information .",
    "the chief disadvantage of flash memories is their inherent asymmetry between cell programming ( injecting cells with charge ) and cell erasing ( removing charge from cells ) .",
    "while raising the charge level of a cell is an easy operation , reducing the charge level from a single cell is very difficult . in the current technology ,",
    "the process of a charge reducing operation requires completely erasing a whole large block to which the cell belongs and then reprogramming , which will limit the lifetime of a flash memory .",
    "therefore , over - programming ( increasing charge level on a cell above the desired amount ) is a severe problem .",
    "for this reason , during a programming cycle in real application , charge is injected over several iterations , gradually approaching the designated level .",
    "this process will be time - consuming .",
    "moreover , flash memories meet common errors due to charge leakage and reading disturbance .    in order to overcome these problems ,",
    "the novel framework of _ rank modulation _ is introduced in @xcite . instead of encoding information with the absolute values of charge levels ,",
    "data is represented by the relative rankings of the charge levels on a group of cells .",
    "that is , if we have @xmath4 cells and @xmath5 represent the charge levels , then this group of cells is said to encode the permutation @xmath6 such that @xmath7 . in this framework",
    ", we save us the trouble to deal with errors caused by injection of extra charge or due to charge leakage which only affect the absolute values of charge levels but do not affect the relative rankings",
    ". however , sometimes the errors in the charge levels may be large enough to cause some disturbance in the relative rankings . to detect and/or correct such errors we need an appropriate distance measure .",
    "several metrics on permutations are used for this purpose such as kendall s @xmath0-metric @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the @xmath8-metric @xcite , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will only focus on kendall s @xmath0-metric .",
    "the kendall s @xmath0-distance @xcite between two permutations @xmath9 and @xmath10 in @xmath11 is the minimum number of adjacent transpositions required to obtain @xmath10 from @xmath9 , where an adjacent transposition is an exchange of two distinct adjacent elements .",
    "for example , the kendall s @xmath0-distance between @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] is @xmath14 as we may do the adjacent transpositions @xmath15\\rightarrow[2,1,3,4]\\rightarrow[2,3,1,4]$ ] .",
    "distance one between two permutations indicates an exchange of two adjacent cells , due to a small change in their charge levels which switches their relative ranking .",
    "it is further suggested firstly in @xcite , and later in @xcite , @xcite , that the only programming operation allowed is raising the charge level of a cell above all the other cells , which is called a ",
    "push - to - the - top \" operation . in this manner , over - programming is no longer an issue .",
    "gray codes using the  push - to - the - top \" operations under kendall s @xmath0-metric will be the main objective of this rank modulation scheme .",
    "the gray code is first introduced in @xcite and an excellent survey on gray codes is given in @xcite . if we do not consider any distance restriction among codewords , then jiang _",
    "et al._@xcite present gray codes traversing the entire set of permutations .",
    "the usage of gray codes for rank modulation is also discussed in @xcite,@xcite and @xcite .",
    "gray codes for rank modulation which detect a single error under a given metric are known as the snake - in - the - box codes .",
    "snake - in - the - box codes are usually discussed in the context of binary codes in the hamming scheme ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is of our desire to construct snake - in - the - box codes as large as possible .",
    "yehezkeally and schwartz @xcite give an inductive construction of a snake - in - the - box code under kendall s @xmath0-metric of size @xmath16 in @xmath17 , using a code of size @xmath18 in @xmath19 .",
    "in @xcite they also deal with the problem under the @xmath8-metric .",
    "later horovitz and etzion @xcite improve the inductive construction to @xmath20 , where the initial code is of size @xmath21 in @xmath22 .",
    "they also propose a direct construction aiming at a snake of size @xmath23 and it is applied successfully to @xmath3 and @xmath24 via computer search .",
    "they conjecture that this framework can work for all odd integers and leave it as an open problem .",
    "they also ask the problem if there is a better construction . in this paper",
    ", we give a rigorous proof for their construction .",
    "then we also come up with a new construction aiming at a longer snake of size @xmath2 , which is applied successfully to @xmath3 .",
    "thus , we answer the two open problems posed by horovitz and etzion .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we define the basic concepts of snake - in - the - box codes in the rank modulation scheme . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we restate the construction by horovitz and etzion . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we give a proof verifying the validity of their construction . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we propose our new construction and give a longer snake - in - the - box code in @xmath3 and we conjecture that it can be applied to @xmath17 for any @xmath25 .",
    "we conclude the paper in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "in this section we follow @xcite and @xcite to give some definitions and notations for the snake - in - the - box codes in the rank modulation scheme .",
    "let @xmath26 $ ] denote @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 $ ] be a permutation over @xmath26 $ ] such that for each @xmath29 $ ] we have that @xmath30 .",
    "this form is known as the _ vector notation _ for permutations .",
    "another useful notation to describe a permutation is its _ cyclic notation _",
    ", where a permutation is expressed as a product of disjoint cycles corresponding to its orbits .",
    "for example , the vector notation @xmath31 $ ] is equivalent to the cyclic notation @xmath32 .",
    "all the permutations form the group @xmath11 known as the symmetric group on @xmath26 $ ] with @xmath33 . for @xmath34 , their composition , denoted by @xmath35 ,",

    "p - transition _ will be an abbreviated notation for a push - to - the - top operation .    a sequence of p - transitions will be called a _",
    "transitions sequence_. an initial permutation @xmath51 and a transitions sequence @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 together define a sequence of permutations @xmath55 , where @xmath56 for each @xmath57 .",
    "this sequence is a cyclic gray code if @xmath58 and for each @xmath59 , @xmath60 .    given a permutation @xmath28\\in s_n$ ] ,",
    "an _ adjacent transposition _ is an exchange of two adjacent elements @xmath61 , for some @xmath62 , resulting in the permutation @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "kendall s @xmath0-distance _ between two permutations @xmath64 and @xmath65 , denoted by @xmath66 , is the minimum number of adjacent transpositions required to transform one permutation into the other .",
    "a _ snake - in - the - box code _ is a gray code with further restriction that any two permutations in the code have their kendall s @xmath0-distance at least two .",
    "that is , it is capable of detecting one kendall s @xmath0-error .",
    "we will call such a snake - in - the - box code a @xmath67-snake .",
    "we further denote a @xmath67-snake of size @xmath39 with permutations from @xmath11 as an @xmath68-snake .",
    "a @xmath67-snake can be represented by listing either the whole sequence of codewords , or the transitions sequence along with the initial permutation .",
    "in @xcite it is proved that a gray code with permutations from @xmath11 using only p - transitions on odd indices is a @xmath67-snake . by starting with an even permutation and using only p - transitions on odd indices",
    "we get a sequence of even permutations , i.e. , a subset of @xmath69 , the alternating group of order @xmath4 .",
    "this observation saves us the need to check whether a gray code is in fact a @xmath67-snake , at the cost of restricting the permutations in the @xmath67-snake to the set of even permutations .",
    "however , the cost is not a severe problem since that the following assertions are also proved in @xcite .",
    "@xmath70 if @xmath71 is an @xmath68-snake then @xmath72 ;    @xmath70 if @xmath71 is an @xmath68-snake which contains a p - transition on an even index then @xmath73 .",
    "this motivates not to use p - transitions on even indices .",
    "since we merely use p - transitions on odd indices , we will only talk about snake - in - the - box codes in @xmath17 .",
    "in this section we restate a direct construction of horovitz and etzion in @xcite , aiming at a @xmath67-snake of size @xmath1 .",
    "they conjecture that the construction is valid for all odd integers @xmath74 and verify the validity for @xmath22 , @xmath3 and @xmath24 via computer search .",
    "firstly , we make a partition on @xmath75 into disjoint classes according to the last two ordered elements in the permutation .",
    "that is , a class denoted as @xmath76 $ ] consists of all the even permutations @xmath77\\in a_{2n+1}$ ] with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "there are totally @xmath80 classes and each class contains @xmath81 permutations .",
    "we further divide each class into @xmath82 subclasses according to the cyclic order of the first @xmath83 elements in the permutations .",
    "denote each subclass in a class , say @xmath76 $ ] , by @xmath84-[x , y]$ ] where @xmath85 is the cyclic order of the first @xmath86 elements .",
    "( note that in the sequel the letters @xmath87 in a vector notation for a permutation stand for a bunch of numbers , possibly just one number or even empty , and its size and contents can be easily inferred by contexts . ) for example , a class [ 1,2 ] in @xmath3 consists of all permutations @xmath88 $ ] ending with @xmath89 and @xmath90 . and therein a subclass @xmath91-[1,2]$ ]",
    "consists of the permutations @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",

    "we choose the edges in @xmath100 sequentially ( according to the sequence given above ) .",
    "when meeting the edge @xmath97 , the already constructed @xmath67-snake must contain exactly only one necklace in the union of classes @xmath76 $ ] , @xmath98 $ ] and @xmath99 $ ] . without loss of generality",
