    "indium tin oxide ( sn - doped in@xmath4o@xmath5 or so - called ito ) is an interesting and unique material for both fundamental studies and technological applications .",
    "for example , good - quality ito materials exhibit high visible transparencies and low electrical resistivities , @xcite rendering them being widely used in flat displays , solar cells , and resistive touch panes . on the fundamental side",
    ", ito possesses an incomparable free - electron - like energy bandstructure , @xcite while having carrier concentrations ( @xmath6 ) @xmath7 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than those in typical metals .",
    "@xcite as a result , ito reveals overall metallic behavior whose resistivity versus temperature ( @xmath8@xmath9 ) characteristic can be described by the standard boltzmann transport equation at not too low temperatures .",
    "@xcite at low temperatures , quantum - interference corrections to the temperature dependence of @xmath8 due to the weak - localization ( wl ) and electron - electron ( @xmath0-@xmath0 ) interaction ( eei ) effects are pronounced .",
    "@xcite from studies of the wl magnetoresistance ( mr ) , ohyama and coworkers have measured the electron dephasing length @xmath10 in two - dimensional ( 2d ) thin @xcite and three - dimensional ( 3d ) thick @xcite _ homogeneous _ ito films , where @xmath2 is the electron diffusion constant , and @xmath1 is the electron dephasing time .",
    "recently , efetov and tschersich , @xcite and beloborodov _ et al .",

    "( more precisely , the wl effect would cross over from a global phenomenon to a local single - grain phenomenon . ) at temperatures above the characteristic temperature @xmath17 , only the eei effect was predicted to be of importance , which , in particular , would dominate the @xmath9 dependences of both the longitudinal conductivity ( @xmath18 ) and the hall effect .",
    "empirically , ohyama _ et al . _",
    "@xcite had previously found the wl mr in homogeneous ito films to persist up to temperatures as high as 90 k. thus , it would be of interest to test whether the wl effect can be observed in inhomogeneous ( granular ) ito ultrathin films at @xmath19 . moreover , this issue is of timely relevance in the light of the recent interest in the electronic transport properties of nanostructured or nanoporous thin films .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper , we report our 2d wl mr measurements on two series of homogeneous and one series of inhomogeneous ito thin films between 0.3 and 90 k. we found that the wl effect is pronounced in both types of structures and the electron dephasing is governed by the small- and large - energy - transfer @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering processes at low and high measurement temperatures , respectively . below about 12 k ,",
    "depending on samples , the dephasing time became very weakly @xmath9 dependent .",
    "we explain that the fact that the wl mr can be observed at relatively high @xmath20 k is a direct manifestation of the weak electron - phonon ( @xmath0-ph ) relaxation in the low-@xmath6 ito material .",
    "we would like to mention that the homogeneous and inhomogeneous films can be distinguished by their temperature characteristics of the longitudinal resistivity .",
    "in homogeneous films , the low-@xmath9 resistivity ( @xmath8 ) increases with decreasing @xmath9 as described by the conventional wl and eei effects .",
    "@xcite on the contrary , in inhomogeneous films , the low-@xmath9 conductivity ( 1/@xmath8 ) reveals logarithm in @xmath9 dependence as predicted by the recent theories of granular metals @xcite ( see further discussion in sec .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii contains our experimental method .",
    "section iii includes our experimental results and theoretical analysis on the wl mr and the electron dephasing ( @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering ,  saturated \" electron scattering , and @xmath0-ph scattering ) processes .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      as mentioned , recent theories of  granular metals \" ( i.e. , granular systems with intergrain conductivity @xmath21 ) proposed that the usual wl effect , which was originally formulated for homogeneous systems , should be suppressed at temperatures @xmath22 in the presence of granularity .",
    "@xcite empirically , it has previously been found that the wl mr in homogeneous ito films persisted up to several tens degrees of k. @xcite in this work , we have measured the low - field mr in a series of granular ito ultrathin films and compared our results with the wl theoretical predictions , eq .",

    "it should be noted that the characteristic temperature is known to be @xmath24 23 k in our granular ito ultrathin films ( see ref . ) .",
    "figure  [ fig mr - h2 ] indicates that the measured mr ( the symbols ) can essentially be described by the 2d wl theoretical predictions of eq .",
    "( [ eq - wl ] ) ( the solid curves ) .",
    "however , close inspection reveals that eq .",
    "( [ eq - wl ] ) is valid only to a narrower magnetic field range ( @xmath25 t at 2 k , for instant ) , as compared with that ( @xmath26 t at 2 k ) in the homogeneous thin films .",
    "hence , the wl effect , as evidenced in the mr , is not suppressed by the presence of granularity even at @xmath27 .",
    "this result suggests that the quantum - interference wl effect must cross over fairly smoothly from a global phenomenon to a local single - grain phenomenon as @xmath28 progressively decreases with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "this smooth crossover can be ascribed to a relatively long @xmath0-ph relaxation time in this particular low-@xmath6 material ( see further discussion in sec .",
    "iii e ) . as a consequence of the weak @xmath0-ph relaxation , the nyquist term @xmath29 dominates @xmath30 , and",
    "thus @xmath28 varies approximately with @xmath31 up to comparatively high @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the wl mr in ito can still be seen at nearly 100 k , a temperature that is much higher than what could be realized in most normal - metal films .",
    "@xcite ( in typical metals , the @xmath0-ph relaxation usually dominates @xmath30 already at a few degrees of k , @xcite causing a much stronger temperature dependent @xmath32 law , with @xmath33 .",

    "we find that the values of @xmath35 and @xmath37 agree to within a factor of @xmath39 or smaller . also , the values of @xmath36 and @xmath38 are comparable to each other . thus ,",
    "both the small- and large - energy - transfer @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering processes govern the dephasing in inhomogeneous ito ultrathin films up to a very high @xmath40 k.    the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig tau - t2 ] indicates that @xmath30 varies essentially linearly in a wide @xmath9 range from 2 to @xmath41 k in the no . 6 film .",
    "this approximate linearity manifests the fact that the small - energy - transfer process [ the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",

    "for example , for a diffusion constant @xmath53 @xmath54/s , our experimental values are @xmath55 ps in ito and @xmath56 15 ps in polycrystalline metals .",
    "microscopically , it would be of great interest and importance to examine whether a longer @xmath48 could originate from a reduced fermi energy @xmath57 ( or , equivalently , a low electron concentration @xcite ) within the theoretical frameworks of imry _ et al .",

    "this subtle issue concerning a nonmagnetic dephasing origin calls for further theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "we also would like to point out that zaikin and coworkers @xcite have theoretically proposed an @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction induced @xmath50 law , with @xmath61@xmath622 , for highly disordered metals and alloys having @xmath2 values smaller than @xmath56 10 @xmath54/s .",

    "theoretically , the electron scattering by transverse vibrations of defects and impurities dominates the @xmath0-ph relaxation in both regimes . in the @xmath68 limit ( which is pertinent to the present study @xcite ) , the relaxation rate , @xmath69 ,",

    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq - ep ] ) predicts a relaxation rate which is proportional to the carrier concentration @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite since ito has @xmath6 values which are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than those in typical metals , @xcite we expect this @xmath69 rate to be extremely weak .",

    "@xcite in short , the fact that the wl mr can be measured up to nearly 100 k in ito is a direct manifestation of the relatively weak @xmath0-ph scattering in this particular low-@xmath6 material .",
