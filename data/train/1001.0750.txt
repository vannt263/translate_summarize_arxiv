    "9 ) , and use the derived emitting volume of @xmath124 @xmath125 , we obtain an area filling factor for region 1 of 1.5% of the surface area of the star .",
    "region  2 has a larger volume than region  1 by a factor of 300 as determined primarily from .",
    "if we assume that the cooling zone is the continuation of region  1 , we again obtain a length of about 200  km ; however , this short length implies a filling factor larger than the stellar surface area and is not plausible .",
    "instead , we use the scale height of 0.1 @xmath126 for 1.75  mk plasma to estimate a filling factor of 6.8% for region 2 , a value in good agreement with estimates from the ultraviolet ( costa et al .   2000 ) and optical continuum veiling ( batalha et al .",
    "2002 ) . scaling the mass as @xmath127 implies that the mass of region  2 is 30 times the mass of region  1 .",
    "romanova et al .   (",
    "2004 ) have used three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations to show that the hot spots formed on the surface by accretion are inhomogeneous , with the lower density and temperature regions filling a larger surface area than the denser central region , seemingly suggestive of region 2 .",
    "however , the larger mass of region 2 also implies a higher accretion rate than for region 1 , and thus a larger density , in contradiction to our diagnostics .",
    "therefore , we do not interpret region  2 as a second accretion shock with a different accretion rate , but rather as a new accretion - driven phenomena .",
    "the impact from the accretion presumably provides the energy to heat additional material in the stellar atmosphere to over 1  mk .",
    "very recently , two - dimensional mhd simulations have shown that violent outflows of shock - heated material can propagate from the base of the accretion shock for cases with a high thermal to magnetic pressure ratio @xmath50 ( orlando et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "one of the key concepts of the standard one - dimensional accretion model suggests a simple picture ( fig .",
    "the field line that truncates the disk separates the open magnetic field lines of the polar region from the closed magnetic field loops in the equatorial regions .",
    "the region heated by the shock ( our region 2 ) provides a large supply of ionized material available to form the soft x - ray emitting corona presented here , a warm wind ( dupree et al .",
    "2005 ) , and soft x - ray jets ( gdel et al .",
    "this corona exists because magnetic loops confine it , but it is fed by the accretion process and is thus unlike stellar coronae in dwarf stars on the main sequence .",
    "figure  10 illustrates the shock and its surroundings .",
    "this model provides an explanation for the soft x - ray excess discovered in the _ xmm - newton _  extended survey of the taurus molecular cloud ( xest ; gdel et al .",
    "2007c ; telleschi et al .",
    "grating spectra show that this excess emission manifests itself in ctts as enhanced relative to as compared with weak - line t  tauri ( wtts ) and main - sequence stars ( gdel & telleschi 2007 ; robrade & schmitt 2007 ) .",
    "our measurements also demonstrate that the postshock cooling gas can , in some cases , dilute the signature of high @xmath1 and explain why not all accreting systems show high densities .",
    "having carefully distinguished between the accretion and corona in section  3 , we reconsider the assumption that these two components arise from different processes .",
    "gdel & telleschi ( 2007 ) find that the soft x - ray excess depends both on the level of magnetic activity as measured by the total ( including coronal ) @xmath12 and on the presence of accretion . while we suggest that the role of accretion is to heat and ionize the surrounding stellar atmosphere to create a soft x - ray ( postshock cooling ) plasma , it seems possible that this plasma could be further heated to @xmath128  mk , either by the usual coronal heating ( mhd ) processes , or possibly by the accretion energy .",
    "cranmer ( 2009 ) finds that in some systems , accretion can provide the energy for coronal heating to such high temperatures .",
    "studies of star forming regions have found that young stars show strong x - ray activity , with energetic flares and extremely high x - ray emitting temperatures ; however , the increase in activity with rotation rate breaks down for the accreting systems , leading to the conjecture that the stellar dynamo might operate differently in these systems ( preibisch et al .   2005 ) .",
    "we suggest that the accretion process may play a more prominent role than has generally been believed . while x - ray signatures of the accretion shock itself may not usually dominate the emission , the energy from accretion may in fact contribute to feeding and heating a new type of corona .",
    "we have analyzed the deep _ chandra _  hetg spectrum of tw  hya to assess the relative contributions of accretion and coronal emission .",
    "we summarize the most important of our findings :    * the spectrum shows line and continuum emission from @xmath128  mk coronal plasma , which may have a broad emission measure distribution . unlike active main sequence stars , the coronal em distribution abruptly cuts off below @xmath129  mk , probably due to absorption by the accretion stream . *",
    "the spectrum also shows emission lines from plasma at @xmath130  mk , as predicted by standard models of the accretion shock . @xmath0 and @xmath1 diagnostics from he - like are in excellent agreement with accretion models for tw  hya . *",
    "we measure the flux of the forbidden line in tw  hya for the first time to better than 3@xmath18 , allowing a determination of electron density . this density is lower than @xmath1 from by a factor of four and lower than @xmath1 from the standard postshock cooling model by a factor of seven , and leads to a new model of an accretion - fed corona . *",
    "the high @xmath0 ions suggest a stellar corona .",
    "by contrast , line ratio diagnostics from the lower @xmath0 ions , indicate two regions with different densities . in our model , the accretion shock itself has @xmath131  mk and @xmath132 @xmath6 , while the postshock cooling region has @xmath133  mk and @xmath134 @xmath6 .",
    "the postshock plasma has 30 times more mass than the shock itself .",
    "the surface area filling factor of the shock is 1.5% while the postshock filling factor is approximately 6.8% .",
    "* line ratio diagnostics require at least two different absorbers , with higher column density ( @xmath2 ) for higher charge state .",
    "absorption by the accretion stream is larger by a factor of 2.5 for the shock than for the postshock region . *",
    "a range of models for the em distribution and elemental abundances provides acceptable fits to the global spectrum .",
    "while absorption , emission measure , and abundances are not independently determined by such methods , the high ne / o abundance seems to be a robust result . * from line profile analysis of lines",
    "we determine a subsonic turbulent velocity of about 165 km s@xmath14 .",
    "this high resolution x - ray spectrum of tw  hya presents a rich set of diagnostic emission lines for characterizing the physical conditions of the high energy plasma and understanding the dominant physical processes .",
    "the observations strongly support the model of an accretion shock producing a few mk gas at high density , as first suggested by kastner et al .",
    "( 2002 ) from an earlier hetg spectrum .",
    "the diagnostics also support the role of accretion in producing the soft x - ray excess at previously discovered ( gdel & telleschi 2007 ; robrade & schmitt 2007 ) .",
    "this excess emission requires that the accretion shock heat a large volume in the surrounding stellar atmosphere . in tw  hya the filling factor at is larger than the filling factor of the shock at , and is consistent with the filling factors of the ultraviolet and optical continua . both open and closed magnetic field lines may emerge from this surrounding area to channel this ionized gas back into the corona .",
    "while it is not yet clear whether the energy from the impact of accretion at the star can heat a hot ( 10  mk ) corona , accelerate a highly ionized stellar wind , or drive hot jets , we suggest that accretion - fed coronae may be ubiquitous in accreting young stars .",
