    "scalar field cosmology is of importance in the study of the early universe and particularly in the investigation of inflation ( during which the universe undergoes a period of accelerated expansion @xcite ) .",
    "one particular class of inflationary cosmological models are those with a scalar field and an exponential potential of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are non - negative constants .",
    "models with an exponential scalar field potential arise naturally in alternative theories of gravity , such as , for example , scalar - tensor theories .",
    "scalar - tensor theories of gravitation , in which gravity is mediated by a long - range scalar field in addition to the usual tensor fields present in einstein s theory , are perhaps the most natural alternatives to general relativity ( gr ) . in the simplest brans - dicke theory of gravity ( bdt ;",
    "@xcite ) , a scalar field , @xmath0 , with a constant coupling parameter @xmath4 , acts as the source for the gravitational coupling .",
    "more general scalar - tensor theories have a non - constant parameter , @xmath5 , and a non - zero self - interaction scalar potential , @xmath6 .",
    "observational limits on the present value of @xmath4 need not constrain the value of @xmath7 at early times in more general scalar - tensor theories ( than bdt ) .",
    "hence , more recently there has been greater focus on the early universe predictions of scalar - tensor theories of gravity , with particular emphasis on cosmological models in which the scalar field acts as a source for inflation @xcite . bdt ( and other theories of gravity , such as , for example , more general scalar - tensor theories and quadratic lagrangian theories and also theories undergoing dimensional reduction to an effective four - dimensional theory @xcite ) , are known to be conformally equivalent to general relativity plus a scalar field having exponential - like potentials @xcite .",
    "scalar - tensor theory gravity is currently of particular interest since such theories occur as the low - energy limit in supergravity theories from string theory and other higher - dimensional gravity theories @xcite . lacking a full non - perturbative formulation which allows a description of the early universe close to the planck time ,",
    "it is necessary to study classical cosmology prior to the gut epoch by utilizing the low - energy effective action induced by string theory .",
    "to lowest order in the inverse string tension the tree - level effective action in four - dimensions for the massless fields includes the non - minimally coupled graviton , the scalar dilaton and an antisymmetric rank - two tensor , hence generalizing gr ( which is presumably a valid description at late , post - gut , epochs ) by including other massless fields ; hence the massless bosonic sector of ( heterotic ) string theory reduces generically to a four - dimensional scalar - tensor theory of gravity . as a result ,",
    "bdt includes the dilaton - graviton sector of the string effective action as a special case @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "string cosmology has recently been investigated by various authors @xcite , and , in particular , @xcite presented a qualitative analysis for spatially flat , isotropic and homogeneous cosmologies derived from the string effective action when a cosmological constant term is included .",
    "a discussion of how exponential potentials arise in effective four - dimensional theories ( in the so - called conformal einstein frame ) after dimensional reduction from higher - dimensional theories such as string theory and m - theory is given in @xcite .",
    "a number of authors have studied scalar field cosmological models with an exponential potential within gr .",
    "homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models were studied by halliwell @xcite using phase - plane methods ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "homogeneous but anisotropic models of bianchi types i and iii ( and kantowski - sachs models ) have been studied by burd and barrow @xcite in which they found exact solutions and discussed their stability .",
    "lidsey @xcite and aguirregabiria et al .",
    "@xcite found exact solutions for bianchi type i models , and in the latter paper a qualitative analysis of these models was also presented .",
    "bianchi models of types iii and vi were studied by feinstein and ibez @xcite , in which exact solutions were found . a qualitative analysis of bianchi models with @xmath9 , including standard matter satisfying various energy conditions , was completed by kitada and maeda @xcite .",
    "they found that the well - known power - law inflationary solution is an attractor for all initially expanding bianchi models ( except a subclass of the bianchi type ix models which will recollapse ) .",
    "the governing differential equations in spatially homogeneous bianchi cosmologies containing a scalar field with an exponential potential exhibit a symmetry @xcite , and when appropriate expansion- normalized variables are defined , the governing equations reduce to a dynamical system , which was studied qualitatively in detail in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the question of whether the spatially homogeneous models inflate and/or isotropize , thereby determining the applicability of the so - called cosmic no - hair conjecture in homogeneous scalar field cosmologies with an exponential potential , was addressed .",
    "the relevance of the exact solutions ( of bianchi types iii and vi ) found by feinstein and ibez @xcite , which neither inflate nor isotropize , was also considered . in a follow up paper",
    "@xcite the isotropization of the bianchi vii@xmath10 cosmological models possessing a scalar field with an exponential potential was further investigated ; in the case @xmath11 , it was shown that there is an open set of initial conditions in the set of anisotropic bianchi vii@xmath10 initial data such that the corresponding cosmological models isotropize asymptotically .",
    "hence , scalar field spatially homogeneous cosmological models having an exponential potential with @xmath11 can isotropize to the future .",
    "however , in the case of the bianchi type ix models having an exponential potential with @xmath11 the result is different in that typically expanding bianchi type ix models do not isotropize to the future ; the analysis of @xcite indicates that if @xmath11 , then the model recollapses .",
    "recently cosmological models which contain both a perfect fluid description of matter and a scalar field with an exponential potential have come under heavy analysis .",
    "one of the exact solutions found for these models has the property that the energy density due to the scalar field is proportional to the energy density of the perfect fluid , hence these models have been labelled scaling cosmologies @xcite . with the discovery of these scaling solutions ,",
    "it has become imperative to study spatially homogeneous bianchi cosmologies containing a scalar field with an exponential potential and an additional matter field consisting of a barotropic perfect fluid .",
    "the scaling solutions studied in @xcite , which are spatially flat isotropic models in which the scalar field energy density tracks that of the perfect fluid , are of particular physical interest .",
    "for example , in these models a significant fraction of the current energy density of the universe may be contained in the scalar field whose dynamical effects mimic cold dark matter .    in @xcite the stability of these cosmological scaling solutions within the class of spatially",
    "homogeneous cosmological models with a perfect fluid subject to the equation of state @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is a constant satisfying @xmath14 ) and a scalar field with an exponential potential was studied .",
    "it is known that the scaling solutions are late - time attractors ( i.e. , stable ) in the subclass of flat isotropic models @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was found that that the scaling solutions are stable ( to shear and curvature perturbations ) in generic anisotropic bianchi models when @xmath15 .",
    "however , when @xmath16 , and particularly for realistic matter with @xmath17 , the scaling solutions are unstable ; essentially they are unstable to curvature perturbations , although they are stable to shear perturbations .",
    "although these solutions are unstable , since they correspond to equilibrium points of the governing dynamical system , the universe model can spend an arbitrarily long time near these scaling solutions , and hence they may still be of physical importance .",
    "in addition to the scaling solutions described above , curvature scaling solutions and anisotropic scaling solutions are also possible . in @xcite homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes with non - zero spatial curvature were studied in detail and three possible asymptotic future attractors in an ever - expanding universe were found .",
    "in addition to the zero - curvature power - law inflationary solution and the zero - curvature scaling solution alluded to above , there is a solution with negative spatial curvature where the scalar field energy density remains proportional to the curvature , which also acts as a possible future asymptotic attractor . in @xcite",
    "spatially homogeneous models with a perfect fluid and a scalar field with an exponential potential were also studied and the existence of anisotropic scaling solutions was also discovered ; the stability of these anisotropic scaling solutions within a particular class of bianchi type models was discussed .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to comprehensively study the qualitative properties of spatially homogeneous models with a barotropic fluid and a non - interacting scalar field with an exponential potential in the class of bianchi type b models ( except for the exceptional case bianchi vi@xmath18 ) , using the hewitt and wainwright formalism @xcite .",
    "in particular , we shall study the generality of the scaling solutions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we define the governing equations , which are modified from those developed in @xcite , and discuss the invariant sets and the existence of monotonic functions . in section iii , we classify and list all of the equilibrium points , and their local stability is discussed in section iv .",
    "we give a detailed analysis , including heteroclinic orbits , for a subset of bianchi type vi@xmath10 models in section v. we leave conclusions and discussion for section vi .",
    "we shall assume that the matter content is composed of two non - interacting components .",
    "the first component is a separately conserved barotropic fluid with a gamma - law equation of state , i.e. , @xmath19 , where @xmath13 is a constant with @xmath20 , while the second is a noninteracting scalar field @xmath0 with an exponential potential @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are positive constants ( we use units in which @xmath21 ) . by non - interacting",
    "we mean that the energy - momentum of the two matter components will be separately conserved .",
    "the state of any bianchi type b model with the above matter content can be described by the evolution of the variables @xmath22 where the evolution of the state variables are given as equations ( 5.8 ) and ( 7.8 ) in wainwright and ellis @xcite with the addition of the klein - gordon equation for the scalar field , @xmath23    by introducing dimensionless variables , the evolution equation for @xmath24 decouples and the resulting reduced system has one less dimension @xcite . defining @xcite @xmath25 the differential equations for the quantities @xmath26  are as follows :    @xmath27    where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to the time @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath30 is defined by @xmath31 , and both @xmath32 ( a curvature term ) and @xmath33 ( a matter term ) are obtained from first integrals : @xmath34 the evolution of @xmath33 is given by the auxiliary equation @xmath35 the parameter @xmath36 where h is the group parameter is equivalent to wainwright s @xmath37 in @xcite . if @xmath38 and @xmath39 then the model is of bianchi type vi@xmath10 . if @xmath40 and @xmath39 and @xmath41 then the model is of bianchi type vii@xmath10 . if @xmath42 then the model is either bianchi type iv or type v. if @xmath43 then the model is either a bianchi type i or a bianchi type ii model .",
    "there is one constraint equation that must also be satisfied : @xmath44 therefore the state space is six - dimensional ; the seven evolution equations ( [ de_1])-([de_7 ] ) are subject to the constraint equation ( [ constraint1 ] ) .",
    "we shall refer to the seven - dimensional state space ( [ theset ] ) as the _ extended _ state space",
    ".    by definition @xmath45 is non - negative , which implies from equations ( [ constraint1 ] ) and ( [ tilden ] ) that @xmath46 and @xmath32 are also non - negative .",
    "thus we have @xmath47 in addition , from the physical constraint @xmath48 together with equation ( [ constraint2 ] ) , we find that the state space is compact .",
    "indeed , we have that @xmath49 since both @xmath45 and @xmath32 are bounded , we have from equation ( [ tilden ] ) that @xmath50 is bounded . in equation ( [ variable_def ] ) we take the `` positive square root '' . in principle , there exists negative and positive values for @xmath51 , but from the definition ( [ variable_def ] ) a negative @xmath51 implies a negative @xmath24 and hence @xmath52 for all time ; i.e. , the models are contracting . since the system is invariant under @xmath53 , without loss of generality we shall only consider @xmath54 .",
    "there are a number of important invariant sets .",
    "recall that the state space is constrained by equation ( [ constraint1 ] ) to be a six - dimensional surface in the seven - dimensional _ extended _ space . taking the constraint equation ( [ constraint1 ] ) into account",
    "we calculate the dimension of each invariant set .",
    "these invariant sets can be classified into various classes according to bianchi type and/or according to their matter content .",
    "some invariant sets ( notably the bianchi invariant sets ) have lower - dimensional invariant subsets .",
    "equilibrium points and orbits occuring in each bianchi invariant set correspond to cosmological models of that bianchi type .",
    "the notation used here has been adapted from @xcite .",
    "various lower - dimensional invariant sets can be constructed by taking the intersection of any bianchi invariant set with the various matter invariant sets .",
    "for example , @xmath55 is a 3-dimensional invariant set describing bianchi type i models with a massless scalar field .    ._bianchi invariant sets .",
    "we note that @xmath56 and @xmath57 are class a bianchi invariant sets which occur in the closure of the appropriate higher - dimensional bianchi type b invariant set ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in addition ,",
    "if @xmath58 is non - negative , @xmath59 and @xmath60 define disjoint invariant sets ( indicated by a superscript @xmath61 in the table ) . due to the discrete symmetry",
