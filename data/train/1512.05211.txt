    "conventionally we do not think of surface tension as sculpting solids , and with good reason : a solid s surface tension , @xmath1 , can only compete against its elastic shear modulus , @xmath4 , at length - scales comparable to or below the solid s elastocapillary length - scale , @xmath10 , which , for most crystalline solids , is sub - angstrom .",
    "however , in suitably soft solids , such as gels and biological tissues , @xmath11 can be microns or even millimeters , making surface tension - driven distortions important in many biological contexts and readily accessible in laboratories @xcite .",
    "recent work has highlighted `` peristaltic '' surface - tension instabilities in soft solid cylinders @xcite , elastocapillary modifications to the theory of wetting @xcite , capillarity - driven bending of wet elastic rods and sheets @xcite , and the inhibitory role of surface tension in elastic creasing @xcite and cavitation @xcite .",
    "elastic analogues of other traditional fluid instabilities , including saffman - taylor fingering @xcite and rayleigh - taylor fingering @xcite , have also recently been reported .    the small soft structures in which elastocapillary effects are important abound in biology .",
    "for example , competition between elasticity and surface tension is well documented in pulmonary airways @xcite , which are only able to inflate when surface tension is reduced by pulmonary surfactant prior to birth @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a growing number of biological organs , including villi @xcite and the mammalian brain @xcite , are now understood to be sculpted into their complex shapes by elastic instabilities @xcite . since developing organs ( and tumors )",
    "are small and soft , surface tension must also shape organs @xcite , making elastocapillary effects an essential component of a mechanical theory of morphogenesis .    , is sufficient .",

    "bottom : schematic of the instability . ]",
    "the canonical example of surface tension driven instability in solids is the rayleigh - plateau instability in soft - solid cylinders @xcite , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mora_peri ] . as in liquids ,",
    "the instability originates in the geometric fact that a volume preserving peristaltic undulation with wavelength @xmath0 along a cylinder of radius @xmath2 reduces its surface area provided @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath13 the resultant saving in surface energy exceeds the elastic energy , so the cylinder is unstable .",
    "previous groups have observed this behavior @xcite , predicted its onset @xcite , considered stretched cylinders @xcite and calculated the high - amplitude behavior of the instability @xcite .",
    "however , all these treatments contain a common surprise : the instability is governed by two length - scales , @xmath2 and @xmath11 , which are comparable around threshold , so one expects @xmath14 .",
    "instead the first unstable mode has infinite wavelength .",
    "we consider four geometries : a solid cylinder , an incompressible ( e.g.  fluid filled ) cylindrical cavity in a bulk solid , a solid cylinder within a bulk solid , and a hollow cylindrical cavity in a bulk elastic solid . in the latter two cases ,",
    "we discover peristaltic instabilities with @xmath15 , demonstrating that the long - wavelength instability in cylinders is an anomaly rather than a signature of elastocapillary instabilities .",
    "since all four systems are described by the same two length - scales , the finite @xmath0 is not explicable as long - wavelength behavior trivially curtailed by a new length - scale ( such as a finite length or finite outer radius ) , but rather is a reversion to the @xmath16 behaviour one might have anticipated in all four cases .",
    "our search for finite - wavelength solid rayleigh - plateau instabilities is further motivated by the existence of finite - wavelength instabilities in other areas of elasticity @xcite .",
    "the full spectrum of wavelengths is seen in the compressive folding of a growing / swelling elastic layer adhered to an infinite elastic substrate @xcite .",
    "if the layer is stiff , it folds with long but finite wavelength @xcite , attaining the @xmath17 euler buckling limit when the substrate s modulus becomes negligible . in the opposite limit , if the layer has a modulus comparable to @xcite or much lower than @xcite the substrate s , the layer undergoes the zero - wavelength biot surface instability @xcite , leading to the formation of cusped folds known as creases or sulci @xcite .",
    "these instabilities , like the solid rayleigh - plateau instabilities discussed here , are governed by a biharmonic ( or similar ) bulk equation augmented by boundary conditions at the interfaces . however , there is no obvious mapping between the sets of the problems , and the underlying physics is quite different  compressive folding increases the boundary s area to release compression , whereas rayleigh - plateau instabilities are driven by area reduction  so direct calculation in the rayleigh - plateau cases are necessary .    beyond the issue of finite vs infinite wavelength ,",
    "the final ( compressible ) cavity geometry explored here mimics channels through soft materials such as capillaries , airways , and those used in microfluidics .",
    "for this reason , we verify and extend this result by using finite elements to compute the high - amplitude behavior of this instability .",
    "we discover that it is strongly subcritical ( like rayleigh - plateau in solid - cylinders @xcite ) , with the channel jumping to an undulating state with very high strains and apparent channel closure .",
    "this suggests that experiencing the instability would be catastrophic for a fluid bearing channel s function , leading directly to blockage and/or material failure .",
    "thus our result gives the lower limit for the radius of an un - reinforced channel through a solid before surface tension precipitates it s collapse .",
    "we first consider a long incompressible neo - hookean cylinder with shear modulus @xmath4 , surface tension @xmath1 and length @xmath18 , initially occupying @xmath19 in an @xmath20 cylindrical coordinate system , as sketched in fig .",

    "following ben - amar @xcite we represent the deformation in a mixed coordinates , specifying @xmath26 and @xmath27 . these mixed coordinates",
    "allow us to evaluate the final state surface energy @xmath28 directly without requiring @xmath29 as one would working in normal fully - reference state coordinates .",
    "furthermore , they also allow us to implement full rather than linearized incompressibility @xcite : in this representation the deformation gradient is f= (     0 & r / r & 0 + -|_z|_r^-1 & 0 & |_r^-1    ) , and , although this is rather more complicated than the standard representation , its determinant is simply @xmath30 , so we can enforce @xmath25 by introducing the mixed - coordinate streamline function @xmath31 and setting z=|_z ,   r^2=2|_r.[eq : streamline ] setting @xmath32 gives the undeformed state , so we examine the stability of this state to infinitesimal peristaltic distortions with wavenumber @xmath33 by considering = r^2z+r f(r ) ( k z)/k[eq : streamline linearized ] such that , to leading order , the cylinder adopts the profile @xmath34 .",
    "expanding @xmath28 to quadratic order in @xmath35 and conducting the @xmath36 integral yields the consequent surface energy , @xmath37 we immediately see the geometric origin of the instability : the peristaltic shape change reduces the cylinder s area if @xmath38 and increases it if @xmath39 , with longer wavelengths ( @xmath40 ) providing the biggest reduction .    similarly , the linearized deformation gradient is @xmath41 substituting this into ( [ eq : enel ] ) , expanding to quadratic order and conducting the @xmath36 integral , ( neglecting the higher - order difference between @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) reveals the consequent elastic energy is : @xmath44'+ \\left(k^2 r^2 + 1\\right)^2 f^2\\bigg ] \\mathrm{d } r.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    minimizing @xmath45 with respect to variations of @xmath46 yields a biharmonic - like fourth - order elastic equation @xcite ^2[f]=0  = + --k^2,[eq : biharmonic ] with two natural boundary conditions , equivalent to imposing zero normal and shear stress on the boundary : @xmath47     for a solid cylinder .",

    "we would normally expect distortions with infinite or vanishing wavelength to generate infinite shears , and hence to be suppressed elastically , and indeed if we look at the form of the peristaltic deformation gradient , eqn .",

    "the @xmath75 cavity solution has @xmath115 and is thus a plane - strain solution associated with a radial displacements of the form @xmath116 , which do decay as @xmath60 but are nevertheless able to bring volume in from infinity since @xmath117 remains finite .",
    "the @xmath74 solid cylinder solution is associated with diverging @xmath36 displacements ( though not shears ) as @xmath40 , which are generated because the cylinder breaks into long regions which alternate between getting thinner and longer and getting fatter and shorter , generating big longitudinal displacements .",
    "clearly these two solutions , with such different @xmath118 , are not kinematically compatible with each other , so it is no surprise that when we consider a solid cylinder through a bulk solid these solutions are not accessed and the instability has finite wavelength .",
    "more generally , a full solution to a fourth - order elasticity problem requires four boundary conditions , and thus a solution with four constants of integration .",
