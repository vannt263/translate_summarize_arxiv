    "use of quenched qcd as an approximation to the full theory depends upon a good understanding of the regions of parameter space where the quenched theory differs in important ways from the full theory .",
    "for the case of the chiral condensate @xmath0 , there may be qualitatively different behaviors for sufficiently small quark mass . whereas the condensate is expected to be finite in the full theory , there are theoretical arguments  @xcite and some initial numerical indications  @xcite that it diverges in quenched qcd .",
    "also numerical analysis  @xcite of an instanton gas model shows a divergence .",
    "a careful study , using a lattice dirac operator that obeys chiral symmetry , to determine the mass range in which quenched qcd is a good approximation to the full theory has not been done .",
    "similarly for the schwinger model , the full theory has a finite condensate@xcite but there are predictions@xcite that it diverges in the quenched theory . thus the schwinger model can be used to investigate the two - dimensional versions of these questions concerning anomalies , topology , chiral symmetry , and condensates and their impact on the relationship between full and quenched theories .",
    "although the schwinger model is in most ways much simpler than qcd , it does present some peculiar difficulties of its own .",
    "strong infrared effects , which are dynamical and nonperturbative in qcd , are already kinematical in the lower dimension of the schwinger model .",
    "there is the possibility that infrared enhancement in the quenched case gives a fermion spectral density that is divergent as the eigenvalue @xmath1 goes to zero and that there is a corresponding infinite condensate @xmath2 .",
    "we have investigated this issue numerically using the overlap dirac operator to describe the massless limit for the fermions and have found strong evidence for these divergences in the quenched schwinger model .    when stated in terms of the low eigenvalue behavior of the fermion spectral density in the quenched schwinger model ,",
    "theoretical discussions have given a lower bound that is finite@xcite and stronger one that is divergent@xcite .",
    "some estimates@xcite that are not bounds have suggested a form diverging exponentially in the volume @xmath3 . the discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite are given in terms of the eigenvalue shifts of the would - be - zero modes associated with subregions of the whole two - dimensional volume @xmath4 .",
    "with larger shifts @xcite due to interactions with other subareas , the spectrum is flat at small @xmath1 in the infinite volume limit .",
    "smaller shifts @xcite leave the would - be - zero modes concentrated near the origin so that the spectral density there diverges as @xmath5 .",
    "other arguments @xcite for the form of the divergence proceed along different lines , but the implication for the spectrum is that the lowest eigenvalues are exponentially small in the volume with a corresponding exponentially large spectral density and condensate .    the data that we present here covers a range of lattice sizes from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the full spectrum of the overlap dirac operator was calculated in gauge backgrounds from the wilson action at several bare couplings .",
    "the next section discusses the lattice formalism used in this paper .",
    "the third section discusses the physics issues in more detail .",
    "the fourth section gives our numerical results .",
    "in addition to the spectrum itself , there are measures of its behavior including @xmath2 and the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue .",
    "the last section contains a summary of our results and some concluding discussion .",
    "since we are interested in studying the small mass region and the massless limit , we need to work with a lattice dirac operator that respects chiral symmetry .",
    "we will use the overlap dirac operator for our numerical study .",
    "it has the form@xcite @xmath8 \\label{eq : over}\\ ] ] with @xmath9 being the hermitian wilson dirac operator in the supercritical region and @xmath10 is the bare fermion mass .",
    "the hermitian overlap dirac operator @xmath11 has paired non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "the topological zero modes are chiral and have partners with unit eigenvalue and opposite chirality . in a fixed gauge field",
    "background@xcite , @xmath12 the sum is over all positive non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the global topological charge , and @xmath4 is the lattice volume .    in the numerical calculation , we generate gauge fields distributed according to the wilson gauge action @xmath15 with @xmath16 the product of u(1 ) link elements around a fundamental plaquette and @xmath17 the lattice coupling constant .",
    "the fermions have periodic boundary conditions . for each choice of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we diagonalize @xmath9 in a fixed gauge field background and form @xmath13 by first forming @xmath19 .",
    "we then diagonalize @xmath20 in the chiral sector that contains topological zero modes , if any . since all computations are done in double precision , we know the non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath13 to an absolute precision of @xmath21 .",
    "in addition we know the exact number of zero eigenvalues of @xmath13 by counting the difference between the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "in the multi - flavor schwinger model , the classical u(1 ) chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by the anomaly , while the su(n ) chiral symmetry can not be broken in two dimensions .",
    "the t hooft vertex @xmath22 is not associated with an intact symmetry or goldstone bosons , so it can and does have a nonzero value @xcite . in the quenched case ,",
    "the exact zero modes of the massless dirac operator cause a divergence in @xmath2 in the massless limit at finite volume .",
    "but as seen in ( [ eq : pbp ] ) , the divergence is of the form @xmath23 . since @xmath24",
    ", it follows that @xmath25 this trivial divergence does not contribute in the case where one first takes the thermodynamic limit and then takes the massless limit .",
    "but this finite volume divergence does not appear in the unquenched schwinger model .",
    "the zero modes of the dirac operator in these backgrounds cause a suppression of such gauge field configurations when the fermion determinant is included as part of the gauge field measure .",
    "the small eigenvalue behavior of the spectrum determines the contribution that the second term in ( [ eq : pbp ] ) makes to @xmath2 .",
    "thus the issues to be numerically investigated are centered upon the small eigenvalue behavior of the massless dirac operator .",
    "the main question is whether the infinite volume spectrum is flat as the eigenvalue @xmath1 goes to zero or has a divergence at small @xmath1 .",
    "consider the gauge field seen by the fermion .",
    "the plaquette magnetic field of the quenched schwinger model is ultra - local with the field fluctuations on different plaquettes uncorrelated in infinite volume .",
    "the plaquette angles are approximately gaussian distributed at weak coupling .",
    "thus the study of fermionic observables in the quenched theory is best thought of as an investigation of a disordered system  @xcite .",
    "let us begin the discussion with two much simpler examples .",
    "for the case of free fermions on an @xmath26 lattice with periodic boundary conditions , the low - lying levels are @xmath27^{1/2 } % \\lambda \\approx [ ( \\case{2 \\pi n_1}{l})^2 + ( \\case{2 \\pi n_2}{l})^2 ] ^{1/2}\\ ] ] so that the level spacing is of order @xmath28 , and the density of states per unit volume is of order @xmath1 at the low end .",
    "another simple case is a uniform magnetic field @xmath29 , which gives landau levels .",
    "the level spacing is of order @xmath29 , and the degeneracy of each level is of order @xmath30 . with the scale of energy intervals larger than @xmath29 ,",
    "the density of states is flat . as we will see later",
    ", the typical @xmath30 is @xmath31 so that the average of @xmath29 over @xmath4 does get smaller with increasing volume .",
    "thus the landau levels give a flat spectral density if the energy resolution is coarser than @xmath32 .",
    "for the case at hand of particles with gyromagnetic ratio 2 , there is a cancellation between the paramagnetic magnetic moment interaction with the field and the diamagnetic kinetic energy contribution that puts the lowest landau level at exactly zero energy .",
    "these are the @xmath33 zero modes .",
    "when the net flux is zero and all boundary conditions are periodic so that the vector potential can be put in the form @xmath34 there is also a pair of zero modes with opposite chirality .",
    "these have the form @xmath35    for the quenched schwinger model the field is neither zero nor uniform .",
    "as noted above , the magnetic field is random with no plaquette - plaquette correlation between the magnetic field on different plaquettes .",
    "thus the variance increases as the area . with the coupling @xmath17 small and @xmath36 large , the flux through the area @xmath37 is gaussian distributed with a typical size of @xmath36 , so that the area average of the field strength is @xmath38 .",
    "= 0.9    [ fig : special ]    what is the fermion spectrum in that case ?",
    "the index theorem tells us that for a net flux @xmath39 through the area @xmath40 , there are @xmath41 modes with zero eigenvalue . for @xmath42 and all boundary conditions periodic , there are two zero modes of the form above . but",
    "what else happens at the low end of the spectrum ?",
    "there are two suggestions for an answer in the literature .",
    "the discussion of casher and neuberger  @xcite begins by dividing the @xmath43 volume into @xmath37-sized pieces with @xmath36 and @xmath44 large .",
    "considered in isolation , each of these areas has of order @xmath36 zero modes .",
    "it is then argued that the effect of interaction between different regions is to shift the eigenvalues of the zero modes away from zero , in such a way as to produce a spectrum that is bounded below by one that is flat at small @xmath1 .    with a similar approach ,",
    "smilga  @xcite argues for a stronger lower bound that gives a spectral density that diverges as @xmath45 .",
    "his stronger result follows from using the fact that the value of the zero mode wave function on the boundary that separates a region with magnetic field from one with zero field is exponentially small in the flux through the region .",
    "arguments using other methods in his paper and in the paper by drr and sharpe  @xcite conclude that the divergence is quite strong with a factor @xmath3 .",
    "this would be a consequence of modes with eigenvalues as small as the inverse of that factor .    for a numerical test of the argument used by smilga to produce the stronger bound ,",
    "we construct a background gauge field configuration that has two regions of size @xmath46 each with constant magnetic field and opposite net fluxes of magnitude @xmath47 .",
    "we study the low lying eigenvalues of the overlap dirac operator and show that they go down exponentially with @xmath47 .    on the @xmath40 lattice ,",
    "fix two regions of size @xmath46 separated by @xmath48 .",
    "the slightly off - symmetric separation is chosen to avoid any accidental lattice symmetries .",
    "on one region of size @xmath46 , we make up a constant magnetic field of flux @xmath47 , and on the other region , we make up a constant magnetic field of flux @xmath49 . elsewhere the field is zero .",
    "an initial numerical check with the field set to zero in one of the regions , verified the presence of @xmath47 topological zero modes for the overlap dirac operator .",
    "then returning to the case of interest with the field in both regions , we calculated the spectrum again . in fig.[fig :",
    "special ] , we plot the low end of the positive half of the spectrum as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "the lowest few of these small eigenvalues go down exponentially in @xmath47 .",
    "we verified that this behavior remains unchanged when small random perturbations are added to the link elements .",
    "the numerical results are less restrictive than the theoretical arguments in that they do not rely on a variational argument , which without further work , applies only to a single mode on the lattice .",
    "also all the lattice modes in addition to the would - be - zeros are included .",
    "this confirms the crucial point in the argument for the stronger bound of ref.@xcite .",
    "however , it does not provide evidence that the spacings might be as small as @xmath50 .",
    "let us now consider the continuum limit .",
    "given the remark above on the lack of correlation in the field strengths , it is not possible to use a scale from that in defining the continuum .",
    "however , there is another simple approach . for",
    "@xmath17 small , ask how large does @xmath47 have to be so that the typical flux through the @xmath37 area is of order one ?",
    "since the flux variance for a single plaquette is @xmath51 and the uncorrelated fluxes add , the variance for the area is @xmath52 .",
    "thus the typical flux through the area is @xmath36 , and @xmath17 sets an inverse length or energy scale .",
    "this happens to be of the same order as the scale for the unquenched schwinger model , in which the mass in lattice units is @xmath53 .",
    "we may hope to get a sensible continuum limit by measuring continuum dimensionful quantities in units of appropriate powers of @xmath54 . to get the finite volume continuum limit , we will want to take @xmath17 to zero and @xmath18 to infinity with @xmath31 fixed .",
    "lattice eigenvalues , @xmath2 , and other quantities with continuum units of energy should be considered in ratios like @xmath55 as @xmath56 .",
    "finally , let us discuss the range of @xmath17 and @xmath18 where these interesting effects might be seen . from two points of view",
    ", we can see that @xmath31 must be large . first if @xmath18 is fixed and @xmath17 is small , then there are only perturbative effects from the gauge field , and the strong infrared fluctuations can not appear .",
    "also if @xmath31 is small , then there are essentially no would - be - zero modes that could realize the the physical pictures of @xcite and @xcite . if @xmath17 is large , then the gauge field is very rough on the scale of a single lattice spacing , and the continuum - based arguments above do not apply .",
    "the smallest region that typically contains a unit of flux should be several lattice units so that it is large enough for the fermion to realize zero modes from the non - zero flux .",
    "thus we must have @xmath17 small and @xmath31 large , which means , of course , that @xmath18 must be large .",
    "= 0.9    [ fig : pbp1 ]    = 0.9    [ fig : hist1 ]    the numerical results described in this section give substantial evidence that the infinite volume limit of the spectral density @xmath57 is indeed infinite for @xmath58 .",
    "we will show this by computing the spectrum of the overlap dirac operator in u(1 ) gauge field backgrounds .",
    "the massless limit is approached in the conventional way by adding a standard mass term .",
    "we will also compute @xmath2 as a function of mass in finite lattice volumes and show that it grows as the mass is lowered before it finally dives to zero as it must for @xmath59 and finite volume .",
    "we will also show that the average value of the lowest eigenvalue does not scale with the volume , nor does it fit predictions from chiral random matrix theory .",
    "strong evidence for a divergence in the non - topological piece of @xmath2 is seen by plotting the gauge ensemble average of the second term in ( [ eq : pbp ] ) as a function of @xmath60 at a fixed @xmath61 for several lattice sizes .",
    "we focus on the small mass region in fig.[fig : pbp1 ] .",
    "the data at @xmath62 show a rise in @xmath2 as the mass is decreased .",
    "this divergence is due to an accumulation of very small eigenvalues at larger @xmath18 as seen in the histogram of the small non - zero eigenvalues in fig.[fig : hist1 ] .",
    "even though only @xmath62 shows a rise in @xmath2 at small masses , an anomalous accumulation of very small eigenvalues is evident at @xmath63 in fig.[fig : hist1 ] .",

    "we see that there is no evidence for scaling in the distribution , whereas chiral random matrix theory predicts a universal function of the form @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 the value of the chiral condensate .",
    "a previous analysis  @xcite of the distribution of the low lying eigenvalues done at smaller physical volume showed that the distribution did not fit the predictions of unitary chiral random matrix theory  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite this was attributed to finite volume effects . in our case , the reason for the discrepancy is not small volumes but a divergent chiral condensate .",
