    "the halo concentration characterizes the halo central density , and may be defined by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the radius of the sphere within which the mean halo density is 200 times the _ critical _ density of the universe .",
    "n - body simulations have successively shown that these two parameters are correlated with each other  the halo concentration is a decreasing function of mass , with a redshift dependence ( decrease with increasing redshift ) at fixed masses @xcite .",

    "most significantly however , as our framework is rooted in physical principles , it can be applied and trusted well beyond the regime probed by simulations .",
    "as another useful application of this framework , we shall find a robust prediction for velocity dispersion of dark matter haloes .",
    "the small scatter , as well as cosmology independence of the velocity dispersion - mass relationship for cluster mass haloes @xcite can then be understood through a simple and elegant energetic argument .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows : in the next section , we define our random variables , their probability distribution and the initial total energy of a spherical region with random gaussian initial conditions .",

    "however , as we will show in section [ conclude ] , they agree reasonably well at large masses .",
    "one reason for this is that the spherical collapse model is well suited for collapse of high mass haloes but fails at low masses @xcite .",
    "the spherical collapse model also evolves weakly with redshift ( our relation changes little with redshift through the @xmath125 variable @xmath126 ) , thus agrees with the results of @xcite and @xcite that concentration of high mass haloes evolves weakly with redshift . in the next subsection",

    "the considerable reduction of this discrepancy with haloes remodelled with the ellipsoidal collapse model motivates the consideration of a similar remodelled collapse in the concentration ",
    "mass relation .",
    "the spherical collapse model described in section [ subsec : sphere ] assumes that collapse occurs if the mean initial density of a region exceeds a critical value , @xmath127 .",
    "this critical value is independent of mass or radius ( only dependent on redshift , z ) of the region and is thus known as the constant barrier .",
    "this implies that at a fixed redshift , all haloes with average initial overdensity greater than @xmath127 will collapse .",
    "however , @xcite modified this relation for assumptions of ellipsoidal collapse , also known as the moving barrier .",
    "this modification is based on the fact that the critical overdensity for ellipsoidal collapse , @xmath128 depends on the mass or size of the collapsing region . an interesting consequence of this mass dependence is that smaller objects , which are more likely to be influenced by external tides , should have larger initial overdensities to hold them together as they collapse .",
    "this effect leads to a higher collapse time which verifies the results of @xcite .",
    "although a fixed mass fixes the collapse time ( equation [ eq : a ] ) for the spherical collapse model , due to the range of ellipticities and prolatenesses in an ellipsoidal collapse , there is a range of collapse times for any fixed region ( mass )",

    "alternatively , one can also describe the shape of a region by its ellipticity , @xmath37 , and prolateness , @xmath144 , @xcite defined by @xmath145 the eigenvalues are ordered such that @xmath146 if @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
    "a spherical region has @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",

    "1.0     1.0",
    "an important feature of equation [ eq : ec ] is that the critical overdensity is larger for less massive systems since @xmath157 decreases for massive systems , thus small mass haloes were more likely to be formed from ellipsoidal collapse .",
    "this was subsequently corroborated by later studies , e.g. , @xcite , who investigated the protohaloes of collapsed haloes in simulations .",
    "equation [ eq : ec ] is extremely useful since it allows us to incorporate the effect of ellipsoidal collapse into our concentration  mass relation .",
    "redshift effects and cosmology dependence are robustly incorporated through the model dependent @xmath127 and the model dependent power spectrum , @xmath158 . the concentration ",
    "mass relation for ellipsoidal collapse is only modified through @xmath126 since that is the bit of the relation related to the initial state of the region before collapse .",
    "thus our new relation becomes @xmath159 which combined with equations ( [ eq : c_einasto]-[eq : c_nfw ] , [ eq : ab]-[eq : badisp ] ) and assuming @xmath160 , fixes the concentration  mass relation .",
    "it is easy to see that the modified relation recovers the scenario for the spherical collapse model at high masses .",
    "it is interesting to understand why the ellipsoidal collapse _ only _ affects the mean , but not the dispersion of @xmath161 .",
    "since @xmath32 is a random gaussian variable that follows the distribution ( [ eq : gaussian ] ) , its dispersion is fixed by the moments of power spectrum for a given size / mass of the spherical region , independent of the time of collapse .",
    "however , its mean is set by its cross - correlation with @xmath44 , which is proportional to the linear collapse threshold .",
    "therefore , just boosting the linear collapse threshold through equation ( [ eq : ec ] ) boosts the mean of @xmath162 by the same factor , but does _ not affect _ its dispersion .    the predicted concentration from this model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comcm ] .",
    "the black line depicts the mean concentration as a function of mass for our model , with the yellow region as the @xmath163 dispersion from the mean value .",
    "our model shows a decrease in the concentration with increasing mass and asymptotes to a constant value for large masses , consistent with simulation results .",
    "an alternative common parametrization of concentration is in terms of the dimensionless peak height parameter , @xmath164 , which captures the bulk of cosmology dependence ( as is evident in our analytic fits ) fig [ fig : newc ] and fig [ fig : allin1e ] show the concentration of haloes as a function of @xmath164 for the nfw profile and the einasto profile , respectively .",
    "for the einasto profile , we chose the shape parameter @xmath9 for relaxed haloes given by @xcite , @xmath165      while we have included the effect of external tidal fields on the ellipsoidal collapse time above , we have ignored its effect on the conservation of total energy .",
    "furthermore , the ejection of 5 - 15% of particles during halo mergers ( primarily from the minor halo ) may lead to a systematic bias in our estimated total energies @xcite .",
    "however , the close agreement between our results and those found in n - body simulations ( e.g. , figs [ fig : comcm ] , [ fig : newc ] , [ fig : allin1e ] , and [ fig : zsign ] ) suggests these effects may be negligible for total energy estimates that go into our predictions .",
    "some possible reasons are :    1 .",
    "the collapse time depends on the energy conservation for the last infalling shell , which is more susceptible to tidal effects than the random particle inside the halo .",
    "2 .   the delay in ellipsoidal collapse is possibly due to tidal fields ; infalling particles do not follow straight lines , and thus density does nt grow as fast as it would in spherical collapse",
    ". this process does nt require the tidal field doing work on the particles .",
    "for example , a static tidal field does nt change the energy but delays the collapse .",
    "similarly , the work done by tidal field averages to zero for a spherical shell .",
    "the ejected particles in mergers have close to zero energy and/or mostly fall back into the halo in subsequent mergers .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the assumption of total energy conservation might be a reasonable approximation for ellipsoidal collapse .",

    "the robustness and small scatter ( or cosmology independence ) of our predictions for velocity dispersion of massive haloes , can be easily understood as the balance between the surface pressure and self - gravity of the haloes .",
    "isolated self - gravitating systems have negative heat capacity , while virialized objects bound by surface pressure ( such as air in a room ) have positive heat capacity .",
    "haloes more massive than @xmath185 ( @xmath186 ) have low enough concentration that the surface pressure drives the sign of heat capacity to positive values ( figure [ fig : sigy ] ) .",

    "qualitatively , the concentration of dark matter haloes is a decreasing function of mass that flattens at very low and very high masses .",
    "this feature  decrease of concentration with mass  can be attributed to major mergers that lead to bigger haloes , but disrupt the inner regions of haloes that subsequently decreases concentration .",
    "we have used the conservation of energy to derive the concentration  mass relation of cdm haloes .",
    "the robustness of our prescription lies in the fact that one can compute the concentration ",
    "mass relation for any cosmology by using the cosmology - dependent power spectrum , cosmic age , and linear ellipsoidal collapse threshold , @xmath191 our results show that the concentration of a halo is set by the initial total energy of the region prior to collapse , as well as the cosmological parameters at collapse time",
    ". small mass haloes mostly collapse from ellipsoidal regions and are better described by the ellipsoidal collapse model while large mass haloes are well described by spherical collapse model .",
    "several analytical relations exist in the literature for the concentration  mass of cdm haloes , though fitted through numerical simulations .",
    "@xcite s model generates the concentration of cdm haloes from simulated and analytic mass accretion histories of haloes .",
    "their model predicts that at very low masses , the concentration varies slower than one should expect from power law fits at high masses .",
    "this feature , according to the authors , is a consequence of the shallow slope of the linear power spectrum at very low masses / small scales .",
    "however , at high masses , it approaches a constant value .",
    "this characteristic corroborates the expectations from our model and is consistent with earlier results of @xcite . @xcite also predict a theoretical mass - concentration relation through their theoretical density profile which relates to the accretion rate of halos .",
    "the free parameter of their model is then fit to the mass - concentration relation of @xcite .",
    "the concentration - mass relation agrees with ours within the simulated range , flattening around @xmath192 with a surprising upturn beyond @xmath193 .",
    "although the concentrations derived from our model may be different when compared to those from the millennium simulations at some masses , it is marginally consistent within the range of dispersion as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : newc ] .",
    "our predicted halo concentrations also have dispersions around the median at fixed masses @xcite .",
    "a novel feature of our prediction is the decrease in the dispersion of the concentration with mass .",
    "this agrees with the results of @xcite , which suggests it may be the result of massive haloes collapsing recently and are thus more homogeneous . on average for different mass bins ,",
    "@xcite had dispersions in their concentrations of about @xmath194 for relaxed haloes , which is marginally consistent with our dispersions at fixed a masses for medium - sized haloes . at @xmath195 ,",
    "our predictions are consistent with the concentrations of @xcite and @xcite for very small microhaloes .",
    "our method does not suffer from the lack of scalability @xcite , it is therefore applicable to any set of cosmological parameters . though our results have been exclusively reported for @xmath195 , it is applicable to different redshifts through the redshift dependence of @xmath164  the usual scaling of the variance @xmath196 by the cosmological growth function , @xmath197 and slightly through the @xmath125 parameter in the definition of @xmath169 , equation [ eq : yemp ] .    as we noted in section",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the concentration ",
    "mass relation plays a crucial role in the expected boost from the annihilation of dark matter haloes .",
    "the expected boost to dark matter annihilation signal from a halo is proportional to the square of its density profile . in fig . [",
    "fig : boost ] , we compare the expected boost from a halo with an nfw or einasto profile relative to that of halo of uniform density of the same mass and radius .",
    "the comparison highlights the fact that different functional forms that fit simulated haloes rather well ( e.g. nfw v.s .",
    "einasto ) could yield vastly different predictions , when extrapolated down to the bottom of cdm hierarchy ( a point also recently made in * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : boost ] , a physical prescription such as energy conservation which have adopted here can lead to much more robust predictions ( even though it is still limited by the uncertainty in the profile ) .    in summary , to derive the dependence of concentration and velocity dispersion of haloes on their mass for a parametric halo profile",
    ", one should follow the following prescription :    1 .",
    "derive the initial energy of a halo in terms of its initial radius ( mass ) and the random gaussian parameters ( density perturbations)(@xmath126 , [ eq : ab ] , with dispersion [ eq : badisp ] ) .",
    "2 .   correct for initial asphericities ( [ eq : yec ] ) 3 .   relate the final energy of the halo to the concentration of the halo . in principle",
    ", one should include the existence of a non zero pressure at the boundary of the halo which incorporates the velocity anisotropy profile of the halo ( equation [ eq : c_einasto]-[eq : c_nfw ] ) .",
    "4 .   express the concentration of the halo in terms of the mass or the dimensionless peak height parameter , @xmath164 or mass .",
    "same energetic arguments give 1-d velocity dispersions in terms of @xmath126 through equations ( [ eq : s_15_nfw]-[eq : s_15_einasto ] ) .    and here is some good news for the impatient reader !",
    "all these steps can be combined into three lines to give concentration at 10% precision , for arbitrary redshift , cosmology , and halo mass ( as long as the power spectrum does not deviate too widely from @xmath17cdm ) :    align y = , [ eq : yemp ] + = 0.78 + 1.09 .",
    "+ = 241 ^2 + 295 + 1156    similar fits are also given for einasto profile in eqs .",
    "[ eq : c_einasto ] and [ eq : s_15_einasto ] , which depend on @xmath9 ( recall that @xmath9 , which is dependent on @xmath164 , is the shape parameter for the einasto profile ) .",
    "the effectiveness of our method lies in the fact that it utilizes the mass variance ( generally , the full power spectrum ) rather than the traditional method of finding a cosmology - dependent power law relation between concentration and mass ; thus it is suitable for all cosmological models and comparisons with simulations .",
    "we must note that our model is most reliable for relaxed _ and _ isolated haloes that are observed today .",
    "it may not successfully predict the concentration of subhaloes or haloes that recently merged because we have assumed virial equilibrium at the time of observation . furthermore , as concentration  mass relations from different simulations have significant differences at fixed masses , one may not expect our predictions to precisely match results from any single group .",
    "however , we note that our predictions for concentration of einasto haloes are in good agreement with both measurements _ and _ extrapolations from simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sign ] ) . a more realistic prescription for ellipsoidal collapse , which may incorporate the non - linear effects of the tidal field and the initial geometry of the collapsing region ( on _ both _ collapse time _ and _ total energy conservation ) , should improve the accuracy of our predictions .",
