    "one common example of a specification is a finite state space markov chain .",
    "the specification for a @xmath16-step markov chain is determined by @xmath17 .",
    "for this reason dblin and fortet referred to specifications as `` chains with infinite connections '' @xcite .    the question of whether a specification @xmath1 uniquely determines the stationary process under a natural `` mixing '' assumption has been prominent since the pioneering work of dblin and fortet @xcite .",
    "however , in the last three decades reasonable progress was achieved only in providing sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of gibbs measure ( see @xcite for detailed discussions and references ) .",
    "harris @xcite studied the behavior of lumped markov chains and introduced important coupling ideas that were used by several later authors .",
    "m. keane @xcite introduced the notion of a continuous @xmath1-function and gave conditions under which a @xmath1-function has a unique measure .",
    "one natural way to express uniqueness conditions is in terms of the modulus of continuity of @xmath1 . to quantify the modulus of continuity of a specification @xmath1",
    ", we define the _ variation of @xmath1 at distance @xmath16 _ to be @xmath18 the continuity of @xmath1 is equivalent to the sequence @xmath19 .    in @xcite , walters showed that if @xmath20 , then the gibbs measure is unique .",
    "walters and ledrappier @xcite established a strong connection between specifications and the thermodynamic formalism of statistical mechanics .",
    "in particular they relate specifications with symbolic dynamics as developed in works of sinai @xcite , ruelle @xcite , bowen @xcite , and others .",
    "walters s work was sharpened by lalley @xcite and berbee @xcite , who showed that the gibbs measure is unique if @xmath21    on the other hand , by the early 1980 s it was known that the equilibrium measures of appropriately chosen one dimensional long - range ising models are not unique ( see @xcite for the hierarchical type models and @xcite for the @xmath22 decaying cases ) .",
    "existence of phase transition was later established for one - dimensional long - range percolation model ( see @xcite and @xcite ) and finally for one - dimensional fk - random cluster model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless a little more than a decade ago it was widely believed that continuous and regular specifications admit a unique gibbs measure .",
    "however , in 1993 , bramson and kalikow @xcite provided a remarkable ( and until now unique ) example of a continuous and regular specification that admits multiple gibbs measures .",
    "the variation of the function @xmath1 in bramson and kalikow s construction is not in @xmath2 for any @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , in their example @xmath24 for some constant @xmath25 .",
    "this gave rise to the following question : for which values of @xmath26 does @xmath27 imply uniqueness .",
    "a few years ago stenflo further sharpened berbee s work @xcite .",
    "however , the results of berbee and stenflo , while improving over walters result , are still in the realm of @xmath28 . recently",
    "johansson and berg @xcite showed that if @xmath1 is regular and @xmath29 is in @xmath30 then @xmath1 admits a unique gibbs measure .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ thm : main ] for every @xmath0 , there exists a regular specification @xmath1 such that @xmath31 and @xmath1 admits multiple gibbs measures .",
