    "the local monodromies of equations that come from geometry are quasi - unipotent which is one reason for our restricting @xmath8 and @xmath9 to be rational .",
    "we restrict further to such @xmath17 s which after a suitable conjugation are contained in @xmath22 . according to @xcite ,",
    "this happens if the characteristic polynomials of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , whose roots are @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , are products of cyclotomic polynomials .",

    "the signature of the quadratic form in the orthogonal case is determined by the relative locations of the roots @xmath28 ( see section  [ beuksum ] ) .",

    "we say that @xmath17 is _ arithmetic _ and in the second case that it is _",
    "thin_. this distinction is important in various associated number theoretic problems ( see @xcite ) and this paper is concerned with understanding which case happens and which is typical . in a given example , if @xmath17 is arithmetic one can usually verify that it is so by producing generators of a finite index subgroup of @xmath36 , on the other hand if @xmath17 is thin then there is no general procedure to show that it is so .",
    "our main result is a robust certificate for showing that certain @xmath17 s are thin .    until recently , other than the cases where @xmath17 ( or equivalently @xmath32 ) is finite , there were few cases for which @xmath17 itself was known .",
    "for @xmath37 it is well known that all the @xmath17 s are arithmetic and we show that the same is true for @xmath38 . for @xmath39 brav and",
    "thomas @xcite showed very recently that the dwork family @xcite @xmath40 as well as six other hypergeometrics with @xmath41 which correspond to families of calabi - yau three - folds , are thin .",
    "in fact they show that the generators @xmath23 and @xmath42 of the above @xmath17 s play generalized ping - pong on certain subsets of @xmath43 , from which they deduce that @xmath17 is a free product and hence by standard cohomological arguments that @xmath17 is thin . on the other hand ,",
    "venkataramana shows in @xcite that for @xmath10 even and @xmath44 @xmath17 is arithmetic ( in @xmath45 ) . in particular , there are infinitely many arithmetic @xmath17 s . in @xcite",
    "many more examples with @xmath46 and for which @xmath17 is arithmetic are given .",
    "another example for which @xmath47 can be shown to be thin is @xmath48 , @xmath49 , see @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath50 is orthogonal and has signature @xmath51 and @xmath36 splits as a product of @xmath52 s .",
    "all of our results are concerned with the case that @xmath32 is orthogonal and is of signature @xmath0 over @xmath53 .",
    "we call these hyperbolic hypergeometric monodromy groups",
    ". there is a unique ( up to a scalar multiple ) integral quadratic form @xmath54 for which @xmath55 , or what is the same thing an integral quadratic lattice @xmath56 with @xmath57 . in section  [ quadform ]",
    "we determine a commensurable quadratic sublattice explicitly which facilitates many further calculations . in this hyperbolic setting",
    "@xmath58 acts naturally as isometries of hyperbolic @xmath59-space @xmath60 and we will use this geometry as a critical ingredient to provide a certificate for @xmath17 being thin .",
    "our first result is the determination of the @xmath28 s for which @xmath32 is hyperbolic , see theorem  [ theo ] .",
    "firstly , these only occur if @xmath10 is odd and for @xmath61 they are completely described by seven infinite parametric families . for @xmath62",
    "there are sporadic examples which are listed in tables  2 and 3 of section  [ numeric ] .",
    "our determination of the seven families is based on a reduction to @xcite s list of families of @xmath32 s which are finite ( i.e. those @xmath32 s for which @xmath63 and have signature ( @xmath64 ) ) .    for @xmath38 ,",
    "if @xmath17 is not finite then it is hyperbolic and as we noted all @xmath65 of these hyperbolic groups are arithmetic .",
    "this is verified separately for each case , there being no difficulty in deciding whether a finitely generated subgroup of @xmath66 is thin or not ( the latter is a double cover of @xmath67 , see the appendix .",
    "for @xmath68 the hyperbolic monodromies behave differently .",
    "our certificate of thinness applies in these cases and it is quite robust as exemplified by    [ theorem1 ] the two families of hyperbolic monodromies @xmath17 with @xmath68 and odd    * @xmath69 * @xmath70    are thin .",
    "in particular infinitely many of the @xmath17 s are thin and as far as we know these give the first examples in the general monodromy group setting of thin monodromy groups for which @xmath71 is high dimensional and simple .",
    "the normalized @xmath1 s corresponding to ( i ) and ( ii ) above ( see @xcite for the normalization ) are @xmath72 respectively .",
    "the second has integral coefficients while the first does not , hence this arithmetic feature of @xmath73 is not reflected in the arithmeticity of the corresponding @xmath47 ( see the end of section  [ familyclassification ] for more about the integrality of the coefficients ) .",
    "our certificate for thinness applies to a number of the families and many of the sporadic examples .",
    "the full lists that we can handle thus far are recorded in theorems  [ thinfamilythm ] and [ secondthin ] of section  [ mindistgraph ] as well as table  [ table3 ] of section  [ numeric ] .",
    "there remain some families for which the method does not apply ( at least not directly ) . in any case",
    "we are led to    [ allthinconj ] all but finitely many hyperbolic hypergeometric @xmath17 s are thin .",
    "we turn to a brief description of our methods . in general",
    "if there is an epimorphism @xmath74 with @xmath75 of infinite index in @xmath76 , then clearly @xmath17 must be of infinite index in @xmath36 . in principle",
    ", @xmath77 could be infinite which would imply that @xmath17 is thin since the latter is essentially generated by involutions , however we know very little about these cohomology groups for the full @xmath78 .",
    "instead we use variations of the quotient @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the vinberg reflective subgroup of @xmath78 .",
    "namely , @xmath80 is the group generated by the elements of @xmath78 which induce reflections of hyperbolic space @xmath60 ( that is the induced action on one of the two sheeted hyperboloids in @xmath10-space , see section  [ cartaninvol ] ) .",
    "vinberg @xcite and nikulin @xcite have shown that except for rare cases @xmath76 is infinite , see section  [ cartaninvol ] for a review of their results which we use . to apply this",
    "we need to understand the image of @xmath17 in @xmath76 .",
    "the key observation is that the element @xmath42 in @xmath17 , which is a linear reflection of @xmath10-space , induces a cartan involution of @xmath60 , that is it is an isometry of @xmath60 which is an inversion in a point @xmath81 .",
    "the reflection subgroup @xmath82 of @xmath17 is the group generated by the cartan involutions @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 is cyclic .",
    "thus essentially up to commensurability the question of whether @xmath17 is thin is a special case of deciding whether a subgroup @xmath86 of @xmath78 generated by cartan involutions is thin or not .",
    "we approach this by examining the image of such a @xmath86 in @xmath87 ( when the latter is infinite ) . at this point",
    "the study is about @xmath78 , @xmath87 , and a general such @xmath86 ( and @xmath10 need nt be odd ) .",
    "we define a graph @xmath88 , the `` distance graph , '' associated with root vectors of @xmath54 which is central to the analysis .",
    "we assume that @xmath54 is even ( that is @xmath89 for @xmath90 ) and for @xmath91 or @xmath92 let @xmath93 be the corresponding root vectors ( in the case that @xmath94 for all @xmath95 which comes up in some cases we also allow @xmath96 to be @xmath97 ) .",
    "the root vectors define linear reflections lying in @xmath78 given by @xmath98 . by our choice of the signature of @xmath54 , for @xmath99 the map @xmath100 induces a cartan involution on @xmath60 while for @xmath101 it induces a hyperbolic reflection on @xmath60 .",
    "assume that the cartan involutions generating @xmath86 come from root vectors in @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath88 has for its vertices the set @xmath102 and we join @xmath103 to @xmath104 if @xmath105 , this corresponds to @xmath103 and @xmath104 having the smallest distance allowed by discreteness , as points in @xmath60 .",
    "the graph @xmath88 is a disjoint union of its connected components @xmath106 and these satisfy ( see section  [ graphprop ] for a detailed statement )    * the components @xmath107 consist of finitely many isomorphism types . * [ [ ( ii ) ] each type is either a singleton or an infinite homogeneous graph corresponding to a transitive isometric action of a coxeter group with finite stabilizer . *",
    "if @xmath107 is a connected component of @xmath88 , then the group generated by the corresponding cartan roots , @xmath108 is up to index @xmath109 contained in the reflection group @xmath110 .    with this the certificate for showing that @xmath86 is thin is clear : according to vinberg and nikulin",
    ", @xmath111 is infinite except in rare cases ( and nikulin has a classification of thee ) , hence if ( iii ) is satisfied for the generators of @xmath86 then @xmath86 must be thin .",
    "the calculations connected with the minimal distance graph can be carried out effectively in general and even explicitly for some of our families .",
    "the process in the general case invokes an algorithm for computing the fundamental polyhedral cell for a discrete group of motions of hyperbolic space which is generated by a finite number of reflections .",
    "such an algorithm is provided in section  [ thinguys ] .",
    "the above leads to the cases discussed in sections  [ mindistgraph ] and [ numeric ] for which @xmath17 is shown to be thin . to end",
    "we note that it is possible that a much stronger version of vinberg s theorem in the following form is valid : for all but finituely many rational quadratic forms @xmath54 ( at least if @xmath10 is large enough ) the full `` weyl subgroup '' @xmath112 generated by _ all _ reflections in @xmath113 ( that is , both those inducing hyperbolic reflections and cartan involutions on @xmath60 ) is infinite index in @xmath114 ( see nikulin @xcite ) .",
    "if this is true then conjecture  [ allthinconj ] would follow easily from our discussion . in section  [ cartaninvol ]",
    "we give an example in dimension @xmath115 with @xmath116 being thin and @xmath117 arithmetic , so there is no general commensurability between these groups .",
    "finally , we note that when our analysis of the thinness of @xmath47 succeeds , it comes with a description of @xmath47 as a subgroup ( up to commensurability ) of a geometrically finite subgroup of @xmath116 and this opens the door to determine the group structure of @xmath47 itself .",
    "we leave this for the future .",
    "we begin by reviewing @xcite which forms the basis of our analysis .",
    "the setup and notation is as in the introduction .",
    "the starting point for studying @xmath17 is the following theorem of levelt .",
    "[ levthm ] for @xmath118 let @xmath119 and @xmath120 be as above .",
    "define the complex numbers @xmath121 to be the coefficients of the polynomials @xmath122 then @xmath17 is the group generated by @xmath123    note that @xmath17 can be conjugated into @xmath22 if and only if the polynomials @xmath124 and @xmath125 above factor as cyclotomic polynomials , and so the roots of @xmath124 and @xmath125 are reciprocal , meaning they are left invariant under the map @xmath126 . since we are interested in integral monodromy groups , we will assume this throughout the article .",
    "also , given a group @xmath127 as above , one obtains another hypergeometric group @xmath128 by taking @xmath129 to be @xmath130 and @xmath131 modulo @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the group @xmath128 is called a _ scalar shift _ of @xmath17 , and as pointed out in remark  5.6 in @xcite , we have that @xmath132 , up to a finite center . thus when classifying all possible pairs @xmath133 such that @xmath17 is integral and fixes a quadratic form of signature @xmath0 in section  [ familyclassification ] we will do so up to scalar shift .",
    "note that for any given @xmath10 there are only finitely many such groups @xmath17 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath47 is _ irreducible _ , meaning that it fixes no proper subspace of @xmath134 , and _ primitive _ , meaning that there is no direct sum decomposition @xmath135 with @xmath136 and @xmath137 for all @xmath138 such that @xmath47 simply permutes the spaces @xmath139 .",
    "finally , we define the reflection subgroup @xmath140 of @xmath47 to be the group generated by the reflections @xmath141 . by theorem  5.3 of @xcite",
    "we have that the primitivity of @xmath47 implies the irreducibility of @xmath140 . with the notation above , beukers - heckman show in @xcite",
    "that @xmath142 falls into one of three categories . given a hypergeometric monodromy group @xmath17 ,",
