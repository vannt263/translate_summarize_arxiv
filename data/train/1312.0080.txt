    "quantum entanglement is the important resource for quantum protocols @xcite .",
    "however , it is shown that some quantum tasks such as deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit ( dqc1 ) @xcite , quantum state merging @xcite and so on , can also display obvious quantum advantages without any entanglement but possibly including quantum discord @xcite",
    ". this could be one of the important reasons why quantum discord has attracted so many attentions in the past years ( see ref . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "quantum discord can be roughly understood as the disturbance on the state of interest induced by one - side local measurements @xcite .",
    "of course , the different versions of quantum discord correspond to the different measures of the disturbance@xcite . in the similar spirit , the measurement - induced nonlocality ( min )",
    "is defined as the maximal change on a bipartite quantum state after a projective measurement which does not influence the local one - side density matrix @xcite .",
    "min has been studied in various fields @xcite , such as the dynamics @xcite , the monogamy @xcite and so on . however , like the geometric quantum discord @xcite , the definition of min is also based on the hilbert - schmidt norm , so it will inevitably suffer from the non - contractivity problem @xcite .",
    "that is , min could be increased by the non - unitary evolution on the subsystem without measurements and by adding an extra product state . for geometric quantum discord , even though lots of new definitions have been proposed @xcite to avoid the non - contractivity problems , only the local quantum uncertainty ( lqu ) @xcite based on the skew information @xcite overcomes the non - contractivity without losing the computability . for min ,",
    "can we also use skew information to solve the problems with the computability preserving ?    in the letter , we give the positive answer . we find that if the considered local observable on subsystem @xmath1 commutes with the reduced density matrix @xmath2 , we can obtain a min - like nonlocality measure , _",
    "i.e. _ , uncertainty - induced quantum nonlocality ( uin ) .",
    "it is found that uin will vanish for the states without min , so uin can be considered as a revised version of min with contractivity . in particular , for @xmath0-dimensional states , uin can also be given by a closed form .",
    "in addition , we also investigate the maximal uncertainty - induced nonlocality .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give the definition of uin and present the closed form for @xmath0 dimensional systems . in section 3 ,",
    "we investigate the maximal uncertainty - induced nonlocality . at the end , the summary is given .",
    "to begin with , we would like to give a brief introduction about local quantum uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the skew information of a density @xmath3 and a local observable @xmath4 is defined by @xmath5^{2},\\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 with @xmath7 is hermitian operator on subsystem @xmath1 with non - degenerate spectrum @xmath8 . for a @xmath0-dimensional state @xmath3 ,",
    "lqu is defined by @xmath9where @xmath10 is the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath11 symmetric matrix @xmath12 with the entries @xmath13 , @xmath14 .    in order to obtain a min - like nonlocality",
    ", we have to require that the local commuting observable @xmath15 commutes with the reduced density matrix @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is hermitian operator on @xmath1 with nondegenerate spectrum @xmath18 .",
    "thus the uin can be defined by the maximal skew information of the state @xmath19 and local commuting observable @xmath20 , which is given in a rigorous way as follows .    * definition 1 . * _ uncertainty - induced quantum nonlocality for a bipartite state @xmath3 is given by _",
    "@xmath21    next , we would like to list the good properties of uin , by which one can find that uin can be considered as a updated version of min .    ( 1 ) .",
    "@xmath22 is invariant under local unitary operation .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "let local unitary operators @xmath23 operate on the state @xmath3 , then the uin becomes @xmath24where @xmath25 commutes with @xmath16 because @xmath26=0 $ ] .",
    "@xmath22 is nonincreasing ( contractive ) under local operation on subsystem @xmath27",
    ". as we know , the skew information @xmath28 is contractive under local operations on @xmath27 .",
    "that is , if the local operation is denoted by @xmath29 , one has @xmath30 .",
    "assume @xmath31 is the optimal observable for @xmath32 such that the corresponding eq .",
    "( 3 ) holds , then one can arrive at @xmath33 ( 3 ) . for product state @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "this is obvious , because the operator @xmath36 commutes with @xmath37 , if @xmath38 commutes with @xmath16 .",
    "next we will give the closed form of uin for an arbitrary @xmath39-dimensional quantum state .",
    "* theorem 1 . * _ for any bipartite @xmath39-dimensional state @xmath3 , uin is given by @xmath40where @xmath41 denotes vector norm , @xmath12 is defined in eq.([lqu ] ) . _",
    "* proof*. for any bipartite @xmath39-dimensional state , the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath42 with @xmath43 the bloch vector .",
    "analogous to ref .",

    "@xmath48 , which implies that the reduced density matrix is identity matrix , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath49 . in this case",
    ", any operator commutes with the reduced density matrix @xmath16 .",
    "so @xmath50 can be an arbitrary normalized vector , so the uin can be given by @xmath51where @xmath52 is the minimal eigenvalue of @xmath12 , and @xmath53 is the corresponding eigenvector .    2 ) .",
    "@xmath54 , this will lead to @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "one can obtain that@xmath57 the second @xmath58 is attributed to @xmath59 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath60 .",
    "( [ lmqu ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ disanzhongqingkuang ] ) give the closed form of @xmath22 . @xmath61",
    "* corollary 1*. _ for a @xmath39-dimension pure state @xmath62 ,  uin reduces to entanglement monotone @xmath63 _    * proof*. it is easy to find that @xmath12 has only one eigenvalue when @xmath64 is a pure state .",
    "the eigenvector of @xmath12 is just the local bloch vector @xmath43 , @xmath65the eigenvalue of @xmath12 is the squared norm of @xmath66 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath67 when @xmath48 , substitute eq.([eq12 ] ) into eq.([lmqu ] ) , eq.([chuntai ] ) will be obtained immediately .",
    "when @xmath54 , it is easy to find that @xmath68 in eq.([chuntai2 ] ) , we ve used the fact that @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . @xmath72    * corollary 2*. _ uin can be explained as the maximal squared hellinger distance between @xmath19 and @xmath73 . _",
    "* proof*. in @xcite , the authors pointed out that lqu can be reinterpreted geometrically as the minimal squared hellinger distance between @xmath19 and @xmath74 . here , replacing @xmath75 by @xmath20 , we will obtain that @xmath76where @xmath77 is the squared hellinger distance , @xmath15 , and @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath46=0 $ ] .",
    "so maximize over the local commuting observable @xmath80 , we will have a geometric interpretation of the uin using hellinger distance .",
    "@xmath61      according to the preceding results , one can find that uin can be considered as an updated version of min without non - contractivity problem .",

    "suppose the subsystem @xmath27 undergoes an amplitude damping channel with the final state given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "the min and the uin for @xmath84 are shown in fig .",
    "obviously , min suffers from the non - contractivity problem , while uin is contractive .",
    "_ vs. _ the rate @xmath85 .",
    "the solid line stands for the uin , and the dashed line corresponds to the min . ]",
    "min is an important measure of nonlocality .",
    "however , min is not the dual definition of geometric quantum discord without any restriction on the measurements @xcite . for integrity",
    ", we would like to present the direct dual definition of lqu .",
    "for the uin , the local commuting observable @xmath15 is restricted to satisfy @xmath86=0 $ ] , so the direct dual measure to the lqu should be defined as the maximum skew information between the state and any possible local observable . in other words",
    ", @xmath17 should be optimized over the set of all local observables . to do so",
    ", we can define the maximal uncertainty - induced nonlocality ( muin ) as follows .",
    "@xmath87where @xmath4 is the local observable on subsystem @xmath1 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "one can easily check that muin also has some good properties , such as the invariance under local unitary operations , the contractivity under local operation on subsystem @xmath27 , reducing to entanglement monotone when @xmath19 is pure state .",
    "in addition , @xmath88 is equal to uin in the case of @xmath48 , while @xmath88 is bigger than uin in other cases .",
    "however , muin may not be a good measure for the nonlocality , for example , it does not vanish for the product states .",
    "we have introduced a measure uin based on skew information .",
    "uin is the maximal skew information between state and the local commuting observable @xmath20 and can be reinterpreted as the maximal squared hellinger distance between @xmath19 and @xmath73 .",
    "uin can be considered as an updated version of min without the non - contractivity problem .",
    "it has a good computability , because for a @xmath0-dimension state , uin can be given by a closed form .",
    "in addition , we also studied the maximal uncertainty - induced nonlocality .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors pointed out that the non - contractivity problem of min can be remedied in terms of helinger distance or bures distance .",
    "the bures distance , which is monotonic , riemannian and can be connected with uhlmann fidelity , seems to be a good candidate @xcite .",
    "however it may be difficult to obtain analytical solution for a general state ( much like the geometric discord based on trace distance @xcite and bures distance @xcite ) .",
    "anyway , it still deserves our further endeavor .",
