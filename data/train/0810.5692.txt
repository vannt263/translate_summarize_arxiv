    "the myriad phenomena accompanying the supercooling of liquids continue to intrigue condensed matter scientists . on approaching the glass transition , the equilibrium , metastable liquid is comprised of fast and slow moving molecules , which interchange their roles at times on the order of the structural relaxation .",
    "this makes the many - body dynamics inherently cooperative and thus too complex to be solved by a first - principles treatment .",
    "various models have been developed to describe and interpret the dynamic properties , but none rise to the level of a predictive theory .",
    "nevertheless , progress can be made by combining experiments that capture some defining characteristic of the dynamics with computer simulations able to provide a microscopic interpretation .",
    "one effective simplification in describing the dynamics of glass - forming liquids is provided by the experimental observation that structural relaxation times @xmath1 and transport coefficients , encompassing a range of thermodynamic conditions , superpose when plotted as a function of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is temperature , @xmath4 density , and @xmath5 a material constant  @xcite .",
    "this thermodynamic scaling of @xmath1 has been demonstrated for dozens of molecular liquids and polymers  @xcite and extends with good accuracy from the high temperature arrhenius region , through the dynamic crossover , down to the glass transition  @xcite .",
    "the justification for the scaling law @xmath6 draws from early work of hoover and coworkers  @xcite , who investigated the properties of fluids having a pair - wise additive intermolecular potential described by an inverse power law ( ipl ) @xmath7 in which @xmath8 is a constant , @xmath9 the intermolecular separation , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 have respective dimensions of energy and length .",
    "generally , the intermolecular potential for liquids is represented as a pair - wise additive interaction , with the steep repulsive part written as an exponential function or an ipl .",
    "an advantage of the ipl is that all reduced thermodynamic and dynamic properties of such a system can be expressed in terms of the variable @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "simulations of vitrifying liquids have often employed an ipl potential  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical models of energy landscapes , relevant for description of the glass transition , are also based on eq .   but with the addition of a density - dependent constant to account for the long - range attractive forces  @xcite .    at high densities",
    "the liquid structure is determined mainly by the repulsions  @xcite , suggesting that if the repulsive potential were accurately described by an ipl , the local dynamics would depend only on @xmath12 , with the empirical scaling exponent @xmath5 identified with @xmath13 .",
    "support for this idea comes from recent simulations using an @xmath8 - 6 lennard - jones ( lj ) intermolecular potential @xmath14\\ ] ] relaxation times and diffusion constants from these simulations conform to eq .   but with a scaling exponent @xmath5 that is not equal to @xmath13  @xcite . for polymers",
    "this is due in some measure to the effect of the intramolecular part of the potential  @xcite .",
    "more generally , a systematic study of lj particles  @xcite showed that @xmath5 follows closely the steepness of the repulsive core . in the latter system , however , the scaling exponent @xmath5 is always larger than @xmath13 , due to contributions of the attractive term in eq .",
    "@xmath5 is equal to the slope of an ipl fitted over the typical distances of closest approach between particles probed in the highly viscous regime .",
    "these interatomic separations are defined by values of @xmath9 between the first nonzero value of the radial distribution function and the position of the half - height of the first peak  @xcite .",
    "in addition to giving rise to the scaling of the dynamics [ eq .  ] , adequacy of the ipl approximation for highly viscous liquids suggests the existence of a correlation between equilibrium fluctuations of the configurational parts of energy and pressure ; i.e. , between the potential energy @xmath15 and the virial @xmath16 .",
    "this expectation follows from the exact correlation between fluctuations in @xmath15 and @xmath16 for an ipl  @xcite .",
    "recently , dyre and coworkers showed from simulations that the potential energy and the virial strongly correlate for various non - associated materials , with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.9  @xcite .",
    "liquids exhibiting both thermodynamic scaling and correlation between @xmath15 and @xmath16 may exhibit other interesting properties , such as sufficiency of a single parameter to describe their temperature - dependent viscoelasticity  @xcite . in this work",
    "we assess the correlation of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in viscous lj liquids having different repulsive interactions ; i.e. , different @xmath8 in eq .  .",
    "these are the same lj liquids previously shown to conform to thermodynamic scaling of their diffusion coefficients  @xcite .",
    "thus , from our results we can test the conjecture of pedersen  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite that liquids whose dynamics follow the thermodynamic scaling are strongly correlating and _ vice versa_.",
    "the models considered in this work consist of additive , equimolar binary mixtures of 500 particles interacting through the @xmath8 - 6 lj potential @xmath17\\ ] ] where @xmath18 are indexes of species .",
    "the mixtures studied have a size ratio @xmath19 , masses @xmath20 , and a unique energy scale @xmath21 .",
    "we refer to them herein as amlj . as in previous work  @xcite",
    ", we consider different repulsive interactions : @xmath22 , 12 , 24 , and 36 .",
    "we also study two other lj liquids having @xmath23 : one proposed by wahnstrm  @xcite , which we denote as wahn , and the non - additive mixture of kob and andersen  @xcite .",
    "this latter , called herein bmlj , is among the most widely used in molecular dynamics simulations of the glass transition . in the following reduced lj units",
    "will be used , assuming @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 as units of distance , energy and time respectively .",
    "all samples are cooled isobarically at pressures @xmath27 , 10 , and 20 using berendsen thermostat and barostat during equilibration .",
    "the production runs are then performed in the @xmath28 ensemble using the velocity - verlet algorithm .",
    "further details on the simulations of amlj models can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we remark that the actual pressure varies with @xmath8 even though the numerical values of @xmath29 are the same , because the depth of the potential increases with @xmath8 . a more appropriate set of reduction parameters for the potential in eq .",
    "is given by the position @xmath30 and the width @xmath31 of the minima of @xmath32 . in terms of these parameters ,",
    "the effective pressure is @xmath33 , where @xmath29 is expressed in reduced lj units .",
    "considering the variation of @xmath34 and @xmath35 for different @xmath8 , the pressure @xmath29 for @xmath36 , for example , should be increased by about a factor of 2.5 to match that of @xmath23 .",
    "normalized instantaneous fluctuations of the potential energy @xmath37 ( circles ) and virial @xmath38 ( squares ) for the amlj model with @xmath39 at the indicated pressure and temperature .",
    "the ordinate of the upper curves has been shifted 5 units for clarity . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : uw ] is a plot of the instantaneous values of the normalized fluctuations in the virial and the potential energy for the amlj liquid with @xmath36 for two selected conditions of @xmath3 and @xmath29 . as discussed below , this material exhibits the weakest correlation of @xmath15 and @xmath16 within the class of systems and range of state conditions investigated herein ; nevertheless , a relationship between the two quantities is evident .",
    "the degree of correlation can be assessed by a variety of means .",
    "we calculate the pearson correlation coefficient @xmath40 from linear regression of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , with the large number of data points , typically @xmath43 per sample , enhancing statistical reliability .",
    "the determination of @xmath44 is carried out simultaneously for all state points over which thermodynamic scaling was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; that is , for each pressure ( @xmath45 , 10 , and 20 ) at temperatures corresponding to normal liquid conditions down to the slow - dynamics regime .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : m ] the fluctuations in the virial are plotted versus those in the potential energy for amlj liquids with @xmath46 , 12 , 24 , and 36 .",
    "the obtained @xmath44 are listed in table  [ table ] , from which two observations can be made : the correlation coefficients are all close to unity , indicating substantial correlation .",
    "this concurs with the results of bailey  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite for simulations of one - component lj liquids with @xmath47 and of bmlj particles .",
    "second , the magnitude of @xmath44 decreases from _ ca_. 0.97 to 0.83 with increasing magnitude of the repulsive exponent .",
    "this ostensibly suggests that liquids with steeper intermolecular repulsions are less strongly correlating .",
    "however , as discussed in section  [ sec : models ] , the actual pressure regime explored by the particles in the simulation changes with @xmath8 .",
    "thus , larger @xmath8 corresponds to smaller effective @xmath29 and @xmath4 .",
    "since the correlation improves at higher density  @xcite , reflecting the greater accuracy of the ipl approximation , the smaller @xmath44 for larger @xmath8 can be ascribed to the differences in thermodynamic conditions .",
    "we demonstrate this in fig .",
    "[ fig : m36p ] , showing results for @xmath36 calculated for @xmath48 and 50 . at these higher pressures",
    "the correlation coefficient is similar to the value of @xmath44 obtained for @xmath23 at @xmath49 and 20 .",
    "this confirms that the poorer correlation ( smaller @xmath44 ) at higher @xmath8 is due to the lower effective pressure , and thus larger mean nearest neighbor distances , rather than to the steepness of repulsion _ per se_.     fluctuations of the virial versus those of the potential energy for the amlj model with @xmath36 at pressures @xmath48 and 50 and all @xmath3 studied ( yielding @xmath50 ) .",
    "these correspond to pressures @xmath51 ( see section  [ sec : models ] ) comparable to the values for @xmath23 at @xmath49 and 20 . ]     least squares slope @xmath0 calculated along individual isobars shown as a function of density @xmath52 .",
    "results are shown for the amlj model with @xmath22 ( @xmath53 ) , 12 ( @xmath54 ) , 24 ( @xmath55 ) , and 36 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines denote the corresponding values of the scaling exponent @xmath5 ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ]    for an exact ipl @xmath57  @xcite and regression of @xmath58 yields the value of @xmath13 as the slope of the fitted line . more generally , while the fact that @xmath59 affirms correlation between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , this is not a proof of proportionality of the two quantities  @xcite .",
    "however , it can be observed that the scatter in the plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : m ] is normally distributed ( random scatter without systematic trends ) , thereby justifying an interpretation of the slope , @xmath0 , of the fitted lines as a measure of @xmath13 .",
    "results for all simulations , including the bmlj and wahn , are listed in table  [ table ] , where it can be seen that there is good correspondence between the slope @xmath0 and the scaling exponent @xmath5 ; that is , strongly correlating liquids conform to thermodynamic scaling , thus confirming the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we can examine the relationship between pressure and energy fluctuations in more detail by evaluating the correlation for each state point individually .",
    "figure  [ fig : gamma ] shows @xmath60 , obtained from linear regression , as a function of @xmath52 .",
    "results for amlj systems with @xmath22 , 12 , 24 , and 36 are shown in the figure , along with the scaling exponents ( indicated by the dashed line ) obtained from superpositioning of the diffusion constants for these liquids .",
    "interestingly , at fixed @xmath8 , @xmath60 essentially collapse onto a single horizontal curve when plotted versus @xmath4 , with only some variation at lower @xmath3 and @xmath29 .",
    "these changes in @xmath60 reflect the fact that the ipl approximation depends weakly on the state point , with the fluctuations of @xmath60 for different state points mostly dictated by density variations ( again excepting @xmath36 for the reasons discussed above ) . for each @xmath8 , the mean of @xmath60 over all state conditions",
    "is equivalent within the error to the @xmath0 obtained from a global fit of @xmath61 versus @xmath62 ( see table  [ table ] ) .",

    "the correlation coefficient @xmath44 obtained from linear regression of @xmath58 data is also included .",
    "statistical uncertainties on @xmath0 correspond to one standard deviation in the `` mean '' case , and to the error associated to linear regression in the `` global '' case . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one final comment concerns the link between the @xmath0 from the @xmath15-@xmath16 correlations and the thermodynamic scaling exponent @xmath5 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we found that a single value of @xmath5 gave excellent superpositioning of the dynamic data .",
    "this means that any change in `` local '' @xmath5 with @xmath3 and @xmath29 must be small ( this issue was examined quantitatively for simulated liquid silica data in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . even for the more poorly correlating liquid ( @xmath36 ) ,",
    "the estimated uncertainty in @xmath5 is only about 15% ( @xmath63 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the slopes describing @xmath15-@xmath16 correlations display a somewhat wider variation upon changing state parameters , especially at low density and temperature .",
    "this may be related to the sensitivity of pressure - energy fluctuations to the shape of the pair potential for distances @xmath9 around and beyond the first peak in the radial distribution function ( e.g. , departures from the ipl form )  @xcite .",
    "further investigations on the role of the attractive tail of the potential on @xmath15-@xmath16 correlations may be required to clarify this point .",
    "in summary , we have shown that for viscous @xmath8 - 6 lj liquids conforming to thermodynamic scaling of their dynamics , there is a strong correlation between the virial and the potential energy .",
    "this property is maintained for systems ranging from relatively soft particles ( @xmath64 ) to those approaching the hard sphere limit ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the correlation deteriorates for lower densities , as the range of the fluctuations extends to large @xmath9 , for which the ipl approximation breaks down .",
    "the slopes obtained from linear regression of the virial vs. potential energy data are in good agreement with the scaling exponents yielding superpositioning of dynamic data , supporting the conjecture that pressure - energy correlations and thermodynamic scaling have a common origin in the ipl approximation of the interaction potential .",
    "our results are in accord with the recent work of dyre and coworkers  @xcite on lj particles and suggest the utility of the ipl approximation in describing essential features of the dynamics of dense , highly viscous liquids .",
