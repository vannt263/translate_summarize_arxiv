    "the native conformation of a protein is strongly correlated with the sequence of amino acid residues building up the heteropolymer .",
    "the sequence makes the protein unique and assigns it a specific function within a biological organism .",
    "the reason is that the different types of amino acids vary in their response to the environment and in their mutual interaction .",
    "it is a challenging task to reveal on what general principles the folding process of a protein is based .",
    "models differ extremely in their level of abstraction , ranging from simple and purely qualitative lattice models to highly sophisticated all - atom off - lattice formulations with explicit solvent that partially yield results comparable with experimental data . due to the enormous computational effort required for simulations of realistic proteins , usually characteristic properties of a protein with a given sequence are studied in detail .",
    "much simpler , but by no means trivial , lattice models enjoy a growing interest , since they allow a more global view on , for example , the analysis of the relation between sequence and structure .    in this paper , we shall focus ourselves on thermodynamic properties of lattice proteins at all temperatures .",
    "in particular , this includes the investigation of the transitions between the different classes of states : lowest - energy states , compact globules , and random coils . since the ground - state ",
    "globule transition occurs at rather low temperatures , a powerful algorithm is required that in particular allows a reasonable sampling of the low - lying energy states . to this end",
    "we combined multicanonical strategies  @xcite with chain growth algorithms  @xcite to a new method  @xcite which works temperature - independent and directly simulates the density of states .",
    "this quantity contains all energetic information necessary for computing the mean energy , free energy , entropy , and specific heat for all temperatures . in the following",
    ", we present results obtained from the application of this method to different lattice proteins with lengths up to 103 monomers , modelled by the simplest lattice formulation for heteropolymers , the hp model  @xcite .",
    "in this model , only two types of monomers enter , hydrophobic ( h ) and polar ( p ) residues .",
    "the model is based on the assumption that the hydrophobic interaction is one of the fundamental principles in protein folding .",
    "an attractive hydrophobic interaction provides for the formation of a compact hydrophobic core that is screened from the aqueous environment by a shell of polar residues .",
    "therefore the energy function reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes summation over nearest lattice neighbours that are nonadjacent along the self - avoiding chain of monomers .",
    "a hydrophobic monomer at the @xmath2th position in the chain has @xmath3 and a polar monomer is assigned @xmath4 .",
    "the first part of this paper , where we explain how our new method works , will be of a more technical nature , while the second part is devoted to applications of this algorithm to heteropolymers . in section  [ msvscg ]",
    "we discuss the main differences of monte carlo methods based on move sets for updating conformations and chain growth algorithms as well as their peculiarities .",
    "this is followed by section  [ thermo ] about the thermodynamic quantities that will be estimated with our method .",
    "then , in section  [ mucacg ] , we enter into the description of the multicanonical chain growth algorithm .",
    "this technical part is preluded by recalling the essential ingredients of perm and nperm@xmath5  @xcite as these are fundamental for setting up our algorithm",
    ". then we proceed with the explanation of multicanonical chain growth and the determination of the multicanonical weight factors .",
    "section  [ valid ] is devoted to the validation of our method , and in section  [ results ] we present the results obtained with our algorithm .",
    "there we focus on thermodynamic properties of heteropolymers with sequences of more than 40 monomers .",
    "finally , we summarise the main aspects of this paper in section  [ summary ] .",
    "polymers fold on a lattice into conformations that are by definition self - avoiding .",
    "this takes into account the finite volume and the uniqueness of the monomers .",
    "a lattice site can hence be occupied by a single monomer only .",
    "this has the consequence that the number of very dense conformations of a polymer is by orders of magnitude lower than that of random coil states . in monte carlo simulations ,",
    "particular attention must therefore be devoted to efficient update procedures which also allow the sampling of dense conformations . in polymer simulations",
    ", so - called move sets were applied with some success to study the behaviour near the @xmath6 point , which denotes the phase transition , where polymers subject to an attractive interaction collapse from random coils to compact conformations .",
    "move sets being widely used usually consist of transformations that change the position of a single monomer and a single bond vector ( end flips ) , a single monomer position but two bonds ( corner flips ) , two positions and three bonds ( crankshaft ) or moves with more changes , and pivot rotations , where the @xmath2th monomer serves as pivot point and one of the two partial chains connected with it is rotated about any axis through the pivot  @xcite . for ( a - thermal ) self - avoiding walks the latter method is known to be very efficient  @xcite .",
    "it becomes inefficient , however , the more dense the conformation is . at low temperatures , the acceptance rate of locally changing a dense conformation decreases drastically and the simulation threatens to get stuck in a specific conformation or to oscillate between two states .",
    "since the search for ground states is an essential aspect of studying lattice proteins , the application of move sets is not very useful , at least for chains of reasonable length .",
    "a more promising alternative is the completely different approach based on chain growth .",
    "the polymer grows by attaching the @xmath7th monomer at a randomly chosen next - neighbour site of the @xmath8th monomer .",
    "the growth is stopped , if the total length @xmath9 of the chain is reached or the randomly selected continuation of the chain is already occupied . in both cases ,",
    "the next chain is started to grow from the first monomer .",
    "this simple chain growth is also not yet very efficient , since the number of discarded chains grows exponentially with the chain length .",
    "the performance can be improved with the rosenbluth chain growth method  @xcite , where first the free next neighbours of the @xmath8th monomer are determined and then the new monomer is placed to one of the unoccupied sites . since the probability of each possibility for the next monomer to be set varies with the number of free neighbours , this implies a bias given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of free neighbours to place the @xmath12th monomer .",
    "the bias is corrected by assigning a rosenbluth weight factor @xmath13 to each chain that has been generated by this procedure .",
    "nevertheless , this method suffers from attrition too : if all next neighbours are occupied , i.e. , the chain was running into a `` dead end '' ( attrition point ) , the complete chain has to be discarded and the growth process has to be started anew .    combining the rosenbluth chain growth method with population control , however , as is done in perm ( pruned - enriched rosenbluth method )  @xcite , leads to a further considerable improvement of the efficiency by increasing the number of successfully generated chains .",
    "this method renders particularly useful for studying the @xmath6 point of polymers , since then the rosenbluth weights of the statistically relevant chains approximately cancel against their boltzmann probability .",
    "the ( a - thermal ) rosenbluth weight factor @xmath14 is therefore replaced by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the temperature and @xmath17 is the energy of the partial chain @xmath18 created with rosenbluth chain growth . in perm ,",
    "population control works as follows .",
    "if a chain has reached length @xmath7 , its weight @xmath19 is calculated and compared with suitably chosen upper and lower threshold values , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . for @xmath22 , _ identical _ copies are created which grow then independently .",
    "the weight is equally divided among them . if @xmath23 , the chain is pruned with some probability , say 1/2 , and in case of survival , its weight is doubled . for a value of the weight lying between the thresholds ,",
    "the chain is simply continued without enriching or pruning the sample .    in the recently developed new variants",
    "nperm@xmath5  @xcite , the number of copies is not constant and depends on the ratio of the weight @xmath19 compared to the upper threshold value @xmath20 and the copies are necessarily chosen to be different ( the method of selecting the copies is based on simple sampling ( ss ) in and a kind of importance sampling ( is ) in ) .",
    "this proves quite useful in producing highly compact polymers and therefore these new methods are very powerful in determining lowest - energy states of lattice proteins .",
    "in order to investigate the thermodynamic properties of lattice proteins accurate simulations are necessary . due to the difficulties with the update of conformations at low temperatures and a primary interest in detecting lowest - energy conformations ,",
    "only a few results of thermodynamic quantities are found in the literature .",
    "nevertheless , the understanding of the conformational transitions and the dependence of their sharpness on the sequence is only possible with algorithms that yield good results for low as well as for high temperatures .",
    "consequently , reasonable results can only be obtained , if the method allows the sampling of the entire energy space .",
    "all energetic statistical quantities of the protein can be expressed by means of the density of energetic states @xmath24 , since the partition function of a lattice protein with given sequence can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the inverse of the thermal energy in natural units .",
    "the sum in the first representation runs over all possible realisations of self - avoiding walks on the lattice , while in the second expression the sum is taken over all energetic states a lattice protein can adopt .",
    "then , the expectation value of any energetic observable @xmath27 is simply @xmath28 and the mean energy as the negative logarithmic derivative of @xmath29 with respect to @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 with these expressions , the specific heat @xmath32 obeys the fluctuation formula @xmath33 moreover , knowing @xmath24 , the helmholtz free energy is obtained from @xmath34 and the entropy can be calculated as @xmath35.\\ ] ]    in addition , non - energetic structural quantities are of interest for discussing the compactness of conformations , such as the end - to - end distance @xmath36 and the radius of gyration @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the centre of mass of the conformation ( with all monomers having equal mass ) .",
    "for the calculation of mean values of non - energetic quantities @xmath39 , eq .",
    "( [ femeana ] ) is replaced by the general formula @xmath40    in the following , we shall focus ourselves on the study of these thermodynamic quantities for different hp lattice proteins and develop an algorithm that allows a direct simulation of the density of states .",
    "before we describe the idea behind the multicanonical chain growth algorithm and the iterative determination of the multicanonical weights which are related to the density of states , we first recall the canonical chain growth variants nperm@xmath5 , on which our algorithm builds up .      in the original chain growth algorithm perm",
    "@xcite , the sample of chains with length @xmath41 is enriched by identical copies if the weight factor ( [ permweight ] ) is bigger than a threshold value @xmath20 . in order to obey correct boltzmann statistics ,",
    "the weight is divided among the clones .",
    "if , however , @xmath23 , the chain is pruned with , e.g.   probability @xmath42 , requiring the weight of a surviving chain to be taken twice .",
    "then one attaches a new monomer at a randomly chosen free next - neighbour site of the previous one .",
    "this is done for all chains that still exist and the procedure is repeated until the total chain length @xmath9 is reached or the growth of a chain was terminated by a dead end or due to pruning . after all chains created within this tree have grown until their end is reached and thus the present so - called _ tour _ is finished , a new growth process starts from the first monomer , i.e. , a new tour begins . having created an appropriate number of chains with length @xmath7 , they will be canonically distributed at the given temperature @xmath16 . in fact , this is also true for all partial chains with intermediate lengths @xmath43 , but there are strong correlations between chains with different lengths @xmath7 .    in the recently proposed new perm variants nperm@xmath5 ( new perm with simple / importance sampling (",
    "ss / is ) ) a considerable improvement is achieved by creating different copies , i.e. , the chains are identical in @xmath8 monomers but have different continuations , instead of completely identical ones , since identical partial chains usually show up a similar evolution . because of the different continuations",
    ", the weights of the copies can differ .",
    "therefore it is not possible to decide about the number of copies on the basis of a joint weight .",
    "the suggestion is to calculate first a predicted weight which is then compared with the upper threshold @xmath20 in order to determine the number of clones .",
    "another improvement of perm being followed up since first applications to lattice proteins is that the threshold values @xmath20 and @xmath21 are no longer constants , but are dynamically adapted with regard to the present estimate for the partition sum and to the number of successfully created chains with length @xmath7 .",
    "the partition sum is proportional to the sum over the weight factors of all conformations of chains with length @xmath7 , created with a rosenbluth chain growth method like , for instance , nperm@xmath5 : @xmath44 here , @xmath45 denotes the @xmath46th generated conformation of length @xmath7 .",
    "the proportionality constant is the inverse of the number of successful tours , i.e. , the number of chain growth starts @xmath47 that led to the generation of at least one chain of length @xmath7 .",
    "note that due to this normalisation it is possible to estimate the degeneracy of the energy states .",
    "this is in striking contrast to importance sampling monte carlo methods , where the overall constant on the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ psumc ] ) can not be determined and hence only _ relative _ degeneracies can be estimated .    since and , respectively , are possible fundamental ingredients for our algorithm , it is useful to recall in some detail how these chain growth algorithms work .",
    "the main difference in comparison with the original perm is that , if the sample of chains of length @xmath48 shall be enriched , the continuations to an unoccupied next - neighbour site have to be different , i.e. , the weights of these chains with length @xmath7 can differ .",
    "therefore it is impossible to calculate a uniform weight like @xmath19 as given in eq .",
    "( [ permweight ] ) _ before _ deciding whether to enrich , to prune , or simply to continue the current chain of length @xmath48 .",
    "as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is therefore useful to control the population on the basis of a predicted weight @xmath49 which is introduced as @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the number of free neighbouring sites to continue with the @xmath7th monomer .",
    "the `` importances '' @xmath52 differ for and . due to its characterisation as a simple sampling algorithm ( ) , where all continuations are equally probable , and as a method with importance sampling ( ) , the importances may be defined as @xmath53 the expression for involves the energy @xmath54 of the choice @xmath55 $ ] for placing the @xmath7th monomer and the number of free neighbours @xmath56 of this choice which is identical with @xmath57 , provided the @xmath58th continuation was indeed selected for placing the @xmath7th monomer . since @xmath59 contains informations beyond the @xmath7th continuation of the chain , controls the further growth better than .",
    "the predicted weight for the @xmath7th monomer is now used to decide how the growth of the chain is continued . if the predicted weight is bigger than the current threshold , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , the sample of chains is enriched and the number of copies @xmath62 is determined according to the empirical rule @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath64 different continuations will be followed up .",
    "using , the @xmath62 continuations are chosen randomly with equal probability among the @xmath51 possibilities , while for the probability of selecting a certain @xmath62-tuple @xmath65 of different continuations is given by @xmath66 considering the probabilities @xmath67 as partial intervals of certain length , arranging them successively in the total interval @xmath68 $ ] ( since @xmath69 ) , and drawing a random number @xmath70 , one selects the tuple whose interval contains @xmath71 .",
    "this tuple of different sites is then chosen to continue the chain .",
    "the corresponding weights are  @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the index of the @xmath74th continuation within the tuple @xmath75 . in the special case of simple sampling",
    "this expression reduces to @xmath76/k$ ] .",
    "if the predicted weight is less than the lower threshold , @xmath77 , however , the growth of this chain is stopped with probability @xmath42 . in this case , one traces the chain back to the last branching point , where the growth can be continued again , or , if there are no branching points , a new tour is started .",
    "if the chain survives , the continuation of the chain follows the same procedure as described above , but now with @xmath78 , where eq .",
    "( [ tuplep ] ) simplifies to @xmath79 since @xmath80 . in this case",
    "the weight of the chain is taken twice . for @xmath81 ,",
    "the chain is continued without enriching or pruning ( once more with @xmath78 ) .    the first tour , where the @xmath7th monomer is attached for the first time , is started with bounds set to @xmath82 and @xmath83 , thus avoiding enrichment and pruning . for the following tours , we use @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the partition function of chains with length unity and @xmath86 the number of created chains with @xmath2 monomers .",
    "the constant @xmath87 is some positive number and controls the number of successfully generated chains per tour . for the lower",
    "bound we use @xmath88 .",
    "all these choices are in correspondence to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the idea behind our multicanonical chain growth method is to flatten the canonical energy distribution provided by nperm@xmath5 . for a given temperature , the latter algorithms yield accurate canonical distributions over some orders of magnitude . in order to construct the entire density of states , standard reweighting procedures",
    "may be applied , requiring simulations for different temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the low - temperature distributions are , however , very sensitive against fluctuations of weights which inevitably occur because the number of energetic states is low , but the weights are high .",
    "thus , it is difficult to obtain a correct distribution of energetic states , since this requires a reasonable number of hits of low - energy states .",
    "therefore we assign the chains an additional weight , the multicanonical weight factor @xmath89 , chosen such that all possible energetic states of a chain of length @xmath7 possess almost equal probability of realisation .",
    "the first advantage is that states having a low boltzmann probability compared to others are hit more frequently .",
    "secondly , the multicanonical weights introduced in that manner are proportional to the inverse canonical distribution at temperature @xmath16 , @xmath90 , respective the inverse density of states @xmath91 for @xmath92 . thus , only one simulation is required and a multi - histogram reweighting is not necessary .",
    "an important conceptual aspect is the fact that the multicanonical weight factors are unknown in the beginning and have to be determined iteratively .",
    "before we discuss the technical aspects regarding our method , we first explain it more formally .",
    "the energy - dependent multicanonical weights are trivially introduced into the partition sum  ( [ psumc ] ) as suitable `` decomposition of unity '' in the following way : @xmath93^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since we are going to simulate at infinite temperature , we express with ( [ flatweight ] ) the partition sum which then coincides with the total number of all possible conformations as @xmath94 with the combined weight @xmath95 taking this as the probability for generating chains of length @xmath7 , @xmath96 , leads to the desired flat distribution @xmath97 , from which the density of states is obtained by @xmath98 the canonical distribution at _ any _ temperature @xmath16 is calculated by simply reweighting the density of states to this temperature , @xmath99 .      in the following ,",
    "we describe our procedure for the iterative determination of the multicanonical weights , from which we obtain an estimate for the density of states .",
    "since there are no informations about an appropriate choice for the multicanonical weights in the beginning , we set them in the zeroeth iteration for all chains @xmath100 and energies @xmath101 equal to unity , @xmath102 , and the histograms to be flattened are initialised with @xmath103 .",
    "these assumptions render the zeroeth iteration a pure nperm@xmath5 run .    since we set @xmath104 from the beginning , the accumulated histogram of all generated chains of length @xmath7",
    ", @xmath105 is a first estimate of the density of states . in order to obtain a",
    "histogram in the next iteration , we update the multicanonical weights @xmath106 and reset the histogram , @xmath107 .",
    "the first and all following iterations are multicanonical chain growth runs and proceed along similar lines as described above , with some modifications .",
    "the prediction for the new weight follows again ( [ wpred ] ) , but the importances @xmath108 ( [ importances ] ) are in the @xmath2th iteration introduced as @xmath109 in the simple sampling case , we still have @xmath110 .",
    "if the sample is enriched ( @xmath60 ) the weight  ( [ npermisweights ] ) of a chain with length @xmath7 choosing the @xmath74th continuation is now replaced by @xmath111 where in the simple sampling case ( ss ) @xmath67 and the binomial factor again cancel each other .",

    "the probability for pruning the current chain or enriching the sample was about @xmath130 .",
    "in almost all started tours @xmath131 at least one chain achieved its complete length .",
    "thus the ratio between started and successfully finished tours @xmath132 is approximately unity , @xmath133 , assuring that our algorithm performed with quite good efficiency .    unlike typical applications of multicanonical or flat histogram algorithms in importance sampling schemes , where all energetic states become equally probable such that the dynamics of the simulation corresponds to a random walk in energy space ,",
    "the distribution to be flattened in our case is the histogram that accumulates the weights of the conformations .",
    "hence , if the histogram is flat , a small number of high - weighted conformations with low energy @xmath101 has the same probability as a large number of appropriate conformations with energy @xmath134 carrying usually lower weights .",

    "our estimates for the degeneracies @xmath160 of the ground - state energies , and for comparison , the lower bounds @xmath161 given in ref .",
    "@xcite , are listed in table  [ 48mertab ] .",
    "the lower bounds were obtained with the constrained - based hydrophobic core construction ( chcc ) method  @xcite .",
    "our values lie indeed above these lower bounds or include it within the range of statistical errors . notice that for the sequences 48.1 , 48.5 , and 48.8 , our estimates for the ground - state degeneracy are much higher than the bounds @xmath161 . in these cases the smallest frame containing",
    "the entire hydrophobic core is rather large ( cube containing @xmath162 monomers with surface area @xmath163 [ bond length]@xmath164 ) such that enumeration of this frame is cumbersome . for 48.5 and 48.8 , we further found ground - state conformations lying in less compact frames ( 48.5 : @xmath165 [ bond length]@xmath164 , 48.8 : @xmath166 [ bond length]@xmath164 ) and those conformations would require still more effort to be identified with the chcc algorithm , which was designed to locate global energy minima and therefore starts the search beginning from the most compact hydrophobic frames .",
    "the ground - state energies of these examples are rather high ( @xmath167 for 48.8 , and @xmath168 for 48.1 and 48.5 ) and therefore a higher degeneracy seems to be natural .",
    "this is , however , only true , if there does not exist a conformational barrier that separates the compact h - core low - energy states from the general compact globules . comparing the ground - state degeneracies and the low - temperature behaviour of the specific heats for the sequences 48.1 , 48.5 , 48.6 , and 48.7 ( all of them having global energy minima with @xmath168 ) as shown in figs .",
    "[ 48mer_gei ] and  [ 48merscr ] , respectively , we observe that 48.6 and 48.7 with rather low ground - state degeneracy actually possess a pronounced low - temperature peak in the specific heat , while the higher - degenerate proteins 48.1 and 48.5 only show up a weak indication of a structural transition at low temperatures .",
    "the hp proteins 48.2 , 48.3 , and 48.9 , which have the lowest minimum energy @xmath169 among the examples in table  [ 48mertab ] , have also the lowest ground - state degeneracies .",
    "these three candidates seem indeed to exhibit a rather strong ground - state ",
    "globule transition , as can be read off from the associated specific heats in fig .",
    "[ 48merscr ] .",
    "we have again measured the mean end - to - end distances and mean radii of gyration which are also plotted as functions of temperature into fig .",
    "[ 48merscr ] .",
    "both quantities usually serve to interpret the conformational compactness of polymers . for hp proteins ,",
    "the end - to - end distance is strongly influenced , however , by the types of monomers attached to the ends of the chain .",
    "it is easily seen from the figures that the 48mers with sequences starting and ending with a hydrophobic residue ( 48.1 , 48.2 , and 48.6 ) have a smaller mean end - to - end distance at low temperatures than the other examples from table  [ 48mertab ] .",
    "the reason is that the ends can form hydrophobic contacts and therefore a reduction of the energy can be achieved .",
    "thus , in these cases contacts between ends are usually favourable and the mean end - to - end distance is close to the mean radius of gyration .",
    "interestingly , there exists indeed a crossover region , where @xmath170 .",
    "comparing with the behaviour of the specific heat , this interval is close to the region , where the phase dominated by low - energy states crosses over to the globule - favoured phase .",
    "the hydrophobic contact between the ends is strong enough to resist the thermal fluctuations in that temperature interval .",
    "the reason is that , once such a hydrophobic contact between the ends is established , usually other in - chain hydrophobic monomers are attracted and form a hydrophobic core surrounding the end - to - end contact . thus , before the contact between the ends is broken , an increase of the temperature first leads to a melting of the surrounding contacts .",
    "the entropic freedom to form new conformations is large since the low - energy states are all relatively high degenerate and do not possess symmetries requiring an appropriate amount of heat to be broken . for sequences possessing mixed or purely polar ends , the mean end - to - end distance and mean radius of gyration",
    "differ much stronger , as there is no energetic reason , why the ends should be next neighbours .    in conclusion",
    ", we see that for longer chains the strength of the low - temperature transition not only depends on low ground - state degeneracies as it does for short chains  @xcite .",
    "rather , the influence of the higher - excited states can not be neglected .",
    "a striking example is sequence 48.4 with rather low ground - state degeneracy , but only weak signals for a low - temperature transition .",
    "= 5.5 cm      the final example we applied our algorithm to was a 103mer as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . until recently",
    ", the `` ground state '' was believed to have energy @xmath171",
    "the up - to - now best estimate was found with to be @xmath172  @xcite and , with an additional bias suppressing contacts between h and p monomers , even @xmath173  @xcite .",
    "our algorithm not only decreased the lowest - energy value to @xmath174 ( see fig .",
    "[ 103mer ] ) , but also enabled us to obtain results for the thermodynamic quantities as in the previous examples .",
    "figure  [ 103mer_ge ] shows the density of states which covers more than 50 orders of magnitude from which we determined the specific heat shown in fig .",
    "[ 103mer_ce ] .",
    "the degeneracy of the lowest - energy state @xmath174 was determined to be of order @xmath175 such that it seems likely that there exist still one or more even lower - lying energetic states .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm",
    "in order to study heteropolymers at very low temperatures with reasonable accuracy , we developed a multicanonical chain growth algorithm based on recently improved variants of perm . comparing with exact enumeration data for hp lattice proteins with 14 monomers",
    ", we validated that our method is suitable to accurately determine thermodynamic quantities for all temperatures .",
    "then , we applied this algorithm to lattice proteins with sequences of more than 40 monomers known from literature . additionally , we determined statistical properties for all temperatures for examples with up to 103 monomers . since our algorithm allows the estimation of the degeneracy of the energy states , we determined for all sequences the ground - state degeneracy as it is an indication for the `` uniqueness '' of the native state .",
    "in particular , we presented a detailed investigation of a sequence of 42 monomers that has interesting characteristic properties , e.g. , a quite low ground - state degeneracy .",
    "since some results regarding the ground states and thermodynamic properties were available  @xcite it was a good candidate for testing our algorithm and for checking the performance of our method .",
    "for this sequence we analysed in detail the temperature - dependent behaviour of radius of gyration , end - to - end distance , as well as their fluctuations , and compared it with the specific heat in order to elaborate relations between characteristic properties of these curves ( peaks , `` shoulders '' ) and conformational transitions not being transitions in a strict thermodynamic sense due to the impossibility to formulate a thermodynamic limit for proteins .",
    "therefore , we identified temperature regions , where global changes of protein conformations occur",
    ".    furthermore , we studied energetic and conformational thermodynamic quantities for the famous list of ten 48mers given in ref .",
    "@xcite in great detail .",
    "these are nice examples as they allow for the comparison of lattice proteins with similar properties ( same number of monomers , identical hydrophobicity ) but sequences that differ in the order of hydrophobic and polar monomers .",
    "this also allowed us to study how conformational properties and the strength of shape transitions depend on the protein sequence .",
    "as an interesting by - product , we not only confirmed the known global - minimum energies for these examples , but we even found a new minimum for the 103mer being the longest sequence under consideration .",
