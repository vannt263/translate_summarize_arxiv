    "the planck mass , @xmath5 , is a fundamental quantity of stellar astrophysics .",
    "the chandrasekhar mass to order unity is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the proton mass .",
    "the maximum mass of a star is approximately the chandrasekhar mass multiplied by the square of the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure ( eddington 1917 ) .",
    "the minimum mass of a black hole is within order unity of the planck mass .",
    "variation of newton s constant affects supernova cosmology via change in the planck mass over cosmic time and was first considered by gaztaaga ( 2002 ) . at that time",
    "there were 42 sne available ; there are now 581 ( suzuki 2012 ) .",
    "uzan ( 2003 ) and narimani , moss , & scott ( 2010 , 2012 ) advise that constraining the constancy of dimensional quantities is perilous .",
    "preferred quantities are , for example , the  gravitational fine structure constant \" , @xmath8 .",
    "the lunar laser ranging experiment initiated by nasa s apollo mission is an @xmath9 experiment , monitoring the specific potential energy of the earth - moon system @xmath10 , where t is the time of flight of earth launched photons .",
    "measuring the luminosity distance of galaxies , @xmath11 , from type ia supernovae is an @xmath9 experiment , as @xmath12 , assuming a fixed fraction , f , of @xmath13 is turned into energy and stellar luminosities are calibrated by hydrogen burning stars .",
    "specifically , to within a numerical constant of order unity , @xmath14 .",
    "speculation about varying g began with dirac ( 1937 ) , who noted that the ratio of the electrostatic and gravitational forces between an electron and a proton was of the same order as the number of times an electron orbits a proton in the age of the universe .",
    "he conjectured that @xmath9 might decay as the inverse of cosmic time .",
    "this 20th century gravity problem ( which is sometimes tackled anthropically ) has been totally eclipsed in the last decade by the cosmological constant problem ( sol 2013 ) .",
    "the contribution to the vacuum energy density of fluctuations in the gravitational field is larger than is observationally allowed by some 120 orders of magnitude . instead",
    ", the vacuum energy density is of the same order of magnitude as the present mass density of the universe .",
    "although ongoing type ia supernova observations indicate that the equation of state of einstein s general relativity is the best fit , this gross cosmological constant problem provides no comfort for constant g orthodoxy .",
    "garcia - berro ( 2007 ) review astronomical measurements and constraints on the variability of fundamental constants generally .",
    "garcia - berro ( 2006 ) fit a polynomial g(z ) = @xmath15 to the snia data , suggestive of a g larger in the past .",
    "verbiest ( 2008 ) measure orbital period rates of pulsars and set a limit of @xmath16 . from white dwarf cooling , garcia - berro et al .",
    "( 2011 ) derive an upper bound @xmath17 and corsico ( 2013 ) find a white dwarf pulsation limit of @xmath18 .",
    "tomaschitz ( 2010 ) considers a gravitational constant scaling linearly with the hubble parameter , and fits the snia hubble diagram and agn source counts , concluding that further observational constraints are required .",
    "furthermore , the luminosity of degenerate carbon core supernovae is proportional to the mass of carbon burned to @xmath4ni .",
    "the precise mechanism which powers a type ia supernova explosion is a matter of lively debate , and we do not know yet whether a detonation or a deflagration occurs . what it is clear is the close correlation between the mass of nickel synthesised in the outburst and the luminosity .",
    "this is discussed in quantitative experiments by gaztaaga ( 2002 ) .",
    "the type snia standard candle is thought to result from a high degree of regulation of this quantity , such as would be provided by approach to a physical limit , the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "however , one may conjecture that the fraction of @xmath13 that is turned into energy may also vary with z. like variation of g with z , this is also an issue for constraints on the equation of state of the universe arising from supernova measurements .",
    "there are two constraints on varying g , that which has been established from the lunar distance since 1969 ( current epoch in table 1 ) and astrophysical constraints acting over cosmic time , such as the ages of the oldest stars .",
    "according to the theories of g variation reviewed by faulkner ( 1976 ) , g may have been larger in the past and may be considered to follow a @xmath19 decline to the current epoch .",
    "williams and dickey ( 2002 ) placed a 1@xmath20 limit of @xmath21 = 1.1 @xmath22 10@xmath23 per year in recent time . if g exceeded the present value by 3 @xmath24 @xmath21 @xmath24 + 7.3 @xmath22 10@xmath25 per year 13.7 gyrs ago , and we assume the supernova luminosity scales with the chandrasekhar mass , we obtain figure  1 .",
    "this includes variation of the density term in the friedmann equation , i.e. @xmath26(t ) with two cases ( 1 )  @xmath26(t ) + @xmath27(t ) = 1 to retain flatness and ( 2 ) the dark energy density @xmath27 = 0.73 with @xmath28 .",
    "we characterize type ( 2 ) models by the value of the curvature , @xmath29 , at z = 0.5 .",
    "we adopt the wmap9 limits on curvature ( hinshaw 2013 ) , 0.0065 @xmath30 0.0012 .      the current supernova data ( suzuki 2012 ) are shown in figure 1 . if we assume @xmath31cdm cosmology with w = 1 , current snia data constrain g stability to @xmath21 = ( 3,+7.3 ) @xmath22 10@xmath25 per year , this constraint is obtained if we adopt the standard model of cosmology as a prior .",
    "we now ( 1 ) reexpress this as a constraint on @xmath32 , and ( 2 ) invert the argument to constrain @xmath33 , given laboratory limits on g variation .",
    "\\(1 ) to determine the upper limit on @xmath32  we calculate @xmath34 to compare the data with the prediction , marginalizing over h@xmath35 , and show this in figure 2 .",
    "the contours of @xmath34 are oriented close to vertical , resulting in clear limits on g variation .",
    "this constraint , our main result , 3",
    "@xmath36 @xmath21 @xmath2 7.3   per year , may be expected to strengthen towards parity with the laboratory , in the era of dark energy experiments such as lsst , see weinberg ( 2013 ) .",
    "an equivalent dimensionless limit is 0.5 @xmath37 1 , where 1/@xmath38 is the age of the universe .",

    "however , these snia data are conventionally used as a measurement of @xmath27 .",
    "there is therefore a degeneracy between this and @xmath41 addressed by the same data .",
    "we can quantify the degeneracy using the generalization of the friedmann equation as a polynomial by mould ( 2011 ) .",
    "mould showed that if , such a polynomial is adopted to fit figure 1 , @xmath42 relationships ( degeneracies ) between the @xmath43 coefficients result from the limited available constraints ( snia , cmb ) .",
    "if the snia data are used to constrain the equation of state of the universe with w  @xmath44  1 , there is therefore a degeneracy between w and @xmath41 addressed by the same data . for z @xmath3 1 and zero curvature , @xmath45 from equations ( 3 ) & ( 11 ) of mould ( 2011 ) . for g stability to 2 parts in 10@xmath46 per year , @xmath47 = 0.0137 at z = 1 , which corresponds to @xmath48 0.03",
    "the current experimental uncertainty in w ( rapetti 2013 ) is 0.07 .",
    "both quantities therefore need to be constrained jointly . on the other hand ,",
    "if one is prepared to adopt the lunar laser ranging results as a prior on dark energy experiments valid over all of cosmic time , the effect of variable g is constrained so that @xmath1w @xmath2 0.02 ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "this is not a negligible contribution to the @xmath33 error budget , and it should not be ignored ( @xmath49 mortonson 2014 ) .",
    "finally , the coupling of @xmath11 , f , and @xmath13 is direct .",
    "analytically , 2@xmath50 = @xmath1f / f = 1.5@xmath1g / g = @xmath51 .",
    "our limit on @xmath47  is thus degenerate with an equivalent limit on @xmath1f / f .",
    "pragmatically , the key result here devolves from an assumed t@xmath52 variation of @xmath9 .",
    "its basis is historical and traces back to dirac s ( 1937 ) large numbers hypothesis and the steady state universe , neither of which have any real traction today . other parameterizations are possible and even natural , such as 1+z scaling .",
    "one form is @xmath9 = @xmath53 + @xmath54 .",
    "in this case we obtain 0.02  @xmath55  0.04 .",
    "if g @xmath3 1+z , the @xmath56 coefficient in equation ( 1 ) is promoted to @xmath57 ; that is , it becomes an anti - radiation pressure term .",
    "assuming @xmath58 = 0 , the resulting degeneracies can be expressed  ( mould 2011)@xmath59 where @xmath60    any g variation that scales as 1+z is traded off against @xmath27 , according to ( from table 2 ) @xmath61 , when snia and cmb anisotropy data measure cosmological parameters simultaneously . a universe with just conventional dark energy and  radiation \" like this has an age in units of 1/h@xmath35 obtained by integrating equation ( 1 ) with @xmath62 = 1 + z.    @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 @xmath65_{arsinh(b)}^\\infty\\ ] ] @xmath66    where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    for @xmath69 = 0.27 , x = 0.575 at z = 0 and",
    "the age is 0.745 .",
    "this is a second contradiction with the standard model of cosmology , as planck finds an age approximately one in these units ( ade et al 2013 , efstathiou 2013 ) . a further contradiction with the age of the globular clusters is mildly ameliorated by higher central temperatures of stars ( gm@xmath70 , where m , r are the stellar mass and radius ) during the epoch of reionization , when they were formed , and the extraordinary temperature sensitivity of the cn cycle of fusion , but for most of the low mass stars lifetime core temperatures are close to normal and ages are only mildly affected ( vandenberg 1977 ) .",
    "how severe a constraint on g @xmath3 1+z is this ?",
    "error analysis gives terms in @xmath71 .",
    "the first and last of these are of order a few percent and the second is smaller .",
    "this parameterization can therefore be rejected with 99% confidence .",
    "g  @xmath72 would be less unacceptable for large n , but is not a natural parameterization .",

    "our conclusions from this work are as follows .    1 .   the validity of the snia standard candle depends on the stability of g and the stability of f , the fraction of the chandrasekhar mass turned into energy .",
    "we have considered the former in this paper and derived a constraint on the gravitational fine structure constant which can be compared with other combined astrophysical - cosmological constraints . but this is inextricably degenerate with possible evolution of f due to changes over cosmic time of snia progenitor astrophysics . with this caveat we set a snia cosmology constraint on g stability in the standard cosmology of ( 3,+7.3 ) @xmath22 10@xmath25 per year .",
    "this limit is two orders of magnitude weaker than that from lunar laser ranging .",
    "but that is a current epoch result and complements , but does not replace , a constraint that spans cosmic time .",
    "the limit is also two orders of magnitude weaker than that arising from the great sensitivity to density of big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the snia standard candle , however , has the distinct advantage of covering the last 10@xmath75 years of cosmic time , rather than the first twenty minutes .",
    "our result is an update of gaztaaga ( 2002 ) , who found @xmath76 12 @xmath22 10@xmath77 /yr for @xmath27 = 0.8 , @xmath78 = 0.2 .",
    "this is a 1@xmath20 limit , like ours , and directly comparable since @xmath79 1 .",
    "the order of magnitude more supernovae now available have allowed us to relax their flat universe assumption , but has also relaxed their limit on @xmath41 . 5 .",
    "caution would dictate that experiments to measure the equation of state of the universe carry the caveat that f and g stability is assumed .",
    "for the latter , lunar laser ranging is available as a prior and limits @xmath80 to 0.02 , but the former has not been quantified and demands further understanding of the snia mechanism .",
    "a parameterization g @xmath3 1+z is interesting on theoretical grounds related to the unity of forces .",
    "however , with such an equation of state the expansion age of the universe is too short .",
    "that parameterization can therefore be rejected with 99% confidence .",
    "we are grateful to chris blake and michael murphy for helpful advice and to an anonymous referee for emphasizing the issue of the quantum of @xmath4ni .",
