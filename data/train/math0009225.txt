    "the motivation for work presented in this letter is , from the side of mathematical physics , in developing some ideas concerning building of a topological field theory from a variant of `` regge calculus '' . as is well - known , regge  @xcite proposed a discretization of space - time in the form of its triangulation and assigning lengths to the edges of such triangulation . in order to construct an analog of functional integral in such theory , either a sum is taken over `` all '' triangulations or some sort of equivalence of different triangulations",
    "is established .",
    "the idea of such equivalence is well known in pure mathematics .",
    "mathematically , we want to put some numeric characteristics in correspondence to a pl ( piecewise - linear ) manifold .",
    "the usual way of doing this is , roughly speaking , as follows .",
    "first , describe the manifold in algebraic or combinatorial terms   we have already done it as soon as we have chosen a triangulation .",
    "such a description can be done , as a rule , in numerous different ways , but those different ways can often be obtained from one another by using a sequence of some simple re - buildings , or `` moves '' . in the case of triangulation ,",
    "such moves affect only a few neighboring simplices from their total maybe very big number .",
    "then , one could try to find an algebraic expression which could be put in correspondence to some `` local '' part of the manifold , e.g. , to a cluster of neighboring simplices , such that it would remain similar to itself in some sense under the mentioned moves .",
    "finally , one could try to construct a `` global '' expression out of the `` local '' ones , in conformity with their algebraic structure , and find some way to extract manifold invariants from such an expression .",
    "a typical case of realization of the stated program is the building of three - dimensional manifold invariants out of quantum @xmath0-symbols . as key property of @xmath0-symbols one",
    "can take the fact that they satisfy the _ pentagon equation _ which is depicted in a natural way as the equality of two diagrams , the first containing two tetrahedra with a common base , while the second  three tetrahedra occupying the same domain in a euclidean space , see figure  [ fig 2 - 3 ] below .",
    "diagrams of such sort can be also introduced for the space of any dimension  @xmath1 ( the left- and right - hand sides must form together , at least from the combinatorial viewpoint , the boundary of an @xmath2-simplex ) .",
    "it seems however that any direct analogs of quantum @xmath0-symbols for higher - dimensional manifolds are rather hard to find .",
    "we would like to propose some other algebraic expressions that obey a relation which , too , deserves the name of pentagon equation , because the picture for it is the same . in constructing our expressions",
    "we assume that the tetrahedra lie in a usual euclidean space and thus possess metric characteristics such as edge lengths , dihedral angles and volumes .",
    "our invariant is a certain expression made of those values .",
    "thus , it may be thought of as produced by some version of regge calculus . in order",
    "that our invariant be well defined , we will assume that our pl manifold satisfies some additional requirements including _",
    "orientability_.    the experience of the theory of discrete integrable models shows that equations that are depicted by the same diagram turn out ultimately to be closely connected , even if the diagram seems at first to have completely different meanings . besides",
    ", a connection of our expressions with usual @xmath0-symbols is suggested by justin roberts work  @xcite where he explains how a metric tetrahedron appears in the quasiclassical limit from @xmath0-symbols corresponding to @xmath3 group ( this was first discovered by ponzano and regge  @xcite , but not proved rigorously ) . here",
    "the quasiclassics is understood as tending of the irreducible representations dimensions to infinity . in this sense ,",
    "our invariant looks `` quasiclassical '' too , but it is worth mentioning that , again , the theory of integrable models teaches that the relations between quantum and classical models are much richer than just classical models being a limiting case of quantum ones , and in fact quantum models are sometimes studied using `` classical '' considerations .",
    "it looks plausible that our constructions can be generalized to higher - dimensional manifolds .",
    "thus , the aim of the present letter is not only in introducing still more invariants of three - dimensional manifolds but in elaborating the necessary technical devices , starting from this simplest case .",
    "below , in section  [ sec local ] we recall the derivation of the `` local '' formula from paper  @xcite .",
    "this formula contains the partial derivative of `` defect angle '' around an edge common for three tetrahedra in the length of that edge , taken in the neighborhood of the flat case ( when the whole cluster of tetrahedra can be imbedded into a 3-dimensional euclidean space ) .",
    "generalization ( globalization ) of this formula onto the case of simplicial complexes having _ many _ tetrahedra requires some technical work and occupies sections [ sec vzaim][sec ves ] .    in section  [ sec vzaim ]",
    "we introduce a matrix  @xmath4 of partial derivatives of _ all _ defect angles ( we call them simply `` curvatures '' ) in _ all _ edge lengths . somewhat unexpectedly , this matrix turns out to be _ symmetric _ : @xmath5 . in section  [ sec dobavl ]",
    "we investigate matrix  @xmath4 from another point of view : it is strongly degenerate , and we get first results in globalizing the formula for @xmath6 ( 2 tetrahedra to 3 tetrahedra ) moves from section  [ sec local ] by using matrix  @xmath4 s minor of the highest rank .",
    "it is also in section  [ sec dobavl ] that we begin using the orientability of the manifold . in section  [ sec forma ]",
    "we continue our technical work and construct a differential form not depending on the choice of the mentioned minor and behaving very nicely under @xmath7 and @xmath8 moves .",
    "in section  [ sec ves ] we divide this differential form by some `` standard '' differential form and obtain a number that does not depend on any edge length !",
    "thus the explicit formula appears for the invariant of a three - manifold .    to demonstrate the efficiency of our formula ,",
    "we calculate in section  [ sec primery ] our invariant in the two simplest examples , namely , for the sphere  @xmath9 and the projective space  @xmath10 .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and their possible generalizations in section  [ sec discus ] .",
    "in this section we recall the derivation of the formula from  @xcite that can be treated as a sort of pentagon equation involving five tetrahedra in a three - dimensional space .",
    "it corresponds in a natural way to replacing a cluster of two euclidean tetrahedra with the cluster of three tetrahedra that covers the same 3-domain , or a @xmath6 _ pachner move _ , as in figure  [ fig 2 - 3 ] .",

    "throughout the rest of this letter , we will be considering `` metrized '' simplicial 3-complexes ( with lengths assigned to their edges ) of the type described in the beginning of section  [ sec vzaim ] with the following two additional constraints : _ the corresponding pl manifold must be orientable , and the lengths are such that the corresponding polyhedron can be put into the 3-dimensional euclidean space _  @xmath73 .",
    "this will be understood as follows : we identify all _ vertices _ of the complex with points in  @xmath73 .",
    "thus , all edges acquire euclidean lengths , and every tetrahedron gets embedded in  @xmath73 .",
    "it is important to note that we do permit any self - intersections of the obtained euclidean tetrahedra .",
    "we say that such lengths form a _ permitted length configuration_. at the same time , we will consider _ any infinitesimal deformations _ of lengths which can thus draw the complex out of the euclidean space or , in other words , produce some infinitesimal defect angles around edges . for brevity , we will sometimes call those defect angles `` curvatures '' ( as an exception from this rule , we will soon be considering a situation where _",
    "one _ `` new '' edge can take any value , but if we remove it the complex fits again into euclidean space ) .",
    "the accurate definition of infinitesimal defect angles shows why we require the orientability of the manifold .",

    "when we map the complex into a euclidean space ( which we suppose to have its own fixed orientation ) , some of the tetrahedra preserve their orientation while the others change it .",
    "we will define the defect angle around a given edge as the algebraic sum of ( interior ) dihedral angles in adjoining tetrahedra taken with the sign  @xmath74 for the tetrahedra that do not change their orientation and with the sign  @xmath75 for the rest of them .",
    "such definition ensures that the defect angles in a complex mapped into euclidean space will be zero ( in absense of infinitesimal deformations ) , and we will be using the addition to theorem  2 exactly in such situation .    the matrix  @xmath4 given by ( [ matr a ] ) is usually strongly degenerate , see examples below in section  [ sec primery ] .",

    "matrix  @xmath4 depends on a chosen permitted length configuration .",
    "we will be dealing with the ranks of @xmath4 and its submatrices for a _ generic _ permitted configuration .",
    "accordingly , below we denote by @xmath78 a chosen subset of @xmath79 edges for which @xmath76 is nondegenerate in the general position , where @xmath79 equals @xmath80 again in the general position .",
    "the rest of edges form the subset that we will denote  @xmath81 .",

    "the lemma can be reformulated as follows : for any set of length differentials @xmath83 of edges in @xmath81 one can find such length differentials of edges in @xmath78 that _ all _ infinitesimal curvatures @xmath84 will equal zero .",
    "now , it follows immediately from the nondegeneracy of matrix @xmath85 that one can always find such differentials of lengths in @xmath78 that all the infinitesimal curvatures _ around edges in @xmath78",
    "_ will be zero .",
    "but any other infinitesimal curvature _ is linearly dependent _ upon the curvatures in @xmath78 and thus vanishes as well .",
    "the lemma is proved .",
    "consider two adjacent tetrahedra ( with a common 2-face ) in the complex and perform the operation of replacing them with three tetrahedra , as in section  [ sec local ] . in doing so , we add a new edge ( @xmath21 in figure  [ fig 2 - 3 ] ) of length  @xmath86 .",

    "then it is easy to show that ( [ eq 3 * ] ) turns into @xmath184 where the exterior product in the enumerator is taken over all edges entering in _ at least one _ of tetrahedra @xmath185 and  @xmath150 ( in other words , the edge @xmath21 is absent from  ( [ eq 3 * * * ] ) ) . to conclude the proof for five vertices it is enough to show that ( [ eq 3 * * * ] ) does not change under the permutation @xmath186 ( note that , again",
    ", @xmath4 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be interchanged freely because of  ( [ eq 3 * . ] ) ) .    under @xmath186 , the factor @xmath187 in the denominator of ( [ eq 3 * * * ] )",
    "is replaced with @xmath188 , and @xmath189 in the enumerator is replaced with @xmath190 .",
    "now it remains to apply the formula @xmath191 compare  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formula  ( 12 ) ) .",
    "finally , if there are more than five vertices , the proof of the lemma is obtained by obvious generalization of the above arguments .",
    "the lemma is proved .",
    "now let us note that the degree of the form  ( [ eq 3 * ] ) increases or decreases under moves @xmath8 in the same way as the degree of the form  ( [ eq * * 6 ] ) , and they both do not change under @xmath7 moves .",
    "thus , the _ difference _ of those degrees is already a manifold invariant !",
    "below , however , we will concentrate on another invariant which is defined only for those manifolds that satisfy the following assumption .",
    "* assumption .",
    "* let our pl manifold be such that the degrees of forms ( [ eq 3 * ] ) and ( [ eq * * 6 ] ) coincide and , moreover , they are proportional in each point of the `` permitted '' variety .",
    "this assumption seems to be satisfied for manifolds with finite fundamental groups , see examples in section  [ sec primery ] .    adopting this assumption , we divide ( [ eq * * 6 ] ) by ( [ eq 3 * ] ) . in general",
    ", we expect to get some function of the edge lengths in the complex .",
    "it turns out , somewhat surprisingly , that it actually _ does not depend on those lengths _ and is thus a constant depending on the manifold only !    to see this , let us return to our arguments about the @xmath149 move from the end of section  [ sec forma ] . when we add the point  @xmath14 , the form ( [ eq * * 6 ] ) is multiplied by the form ( [ eq * * 7 ] ) or , which is the same , ( [ eq * * 8 ] ) .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath192 , firstly , does not change and , secondly , is obviously independent of the position of point  @xmath14 with respect to other vertices of the complex , that is of lengths @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "the point @xmath14 has however equal rights in this respect with the other vertices of the complex ( any vertex can be eliminated , after some preparatory moves , by a @xmath193 move .",
    "thus , it can be regarded as added to some complex by the reverse @xmath149 move ) .",
    "so , the ratio @xmath194 ( if it is well defined ) does not depend at all on how we place the vertices in the euclidean space .",
    "* definition . *",
    "_ we define the invariant @xmath195 for a given closed oriented pl manifold @xmath196 by the formula @xmath197 provided the right - hand side is well defined . _",
    "in order to calculate the invariant  @xmath198 for the sphere  @xmath9 , it is enough to use its decomposition in 2 tetrahedra . in such way",
    "we get a _ pre - simplicial complex _",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) rather than a simplicial complex , but our formulae remain valid for this case as well",
    ".    there will be 4 vertices , say @xmath199 and @xmath13 ; 6  edges which _ all _ enter the set  @xmath81 ; 2  identical volumes  @xmath200 ; and the value  @xmath157 , due to the emptiness of the set  @xmath78 , will be simply  @xmath201 ( so , the rank of matrix @xmath202 will be zero ) .",
    "thus , the formula  ( [ eq * * 6 ] ) will yield in this case exactly the expression  ( [ eq 3 * * ] ) .",
    "this means that @xmath203    consider now the projective space  @xmath10 . for it , we take a triangulation that has , again , 4 vertices @xmath4 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 but now 12  edges and 8  tetrahedra , see figure  [ fig rp3 ] .",

    "the dihedral angles at edge  @xmath209 in those tetrahedra coincide in absolute value but have opposite signs , and this remains so even when we vary  @xmath217 ( in this case , it means that when taking the derivative @xmath216 we fix all lengths except @xmath217 so that @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 but allow @xmath217 to vary in a neighborhood of @xmath223 ) .",

    "say , @xmath227 we note that there exist exactly two tetrahedra containing both edges @xmath44 and  @xmath157 , and one can see from figure  [ fig rp3 ] that in these tetrahedra the derivatives of dihedral angles at edge  @xmath44 in @xmath217 have the _ same _ sign .",

    "in this letter we have only got some first results showing that it is possible to construct , on the base of such quantities as edge lengths , dihedral angles and volumes , an invariant which can be calculated with no complications at least for the sphere  @xmath9 and projective space  @xmath10 .",
    "actually , some calculations have been done also for lens spaces @xmath231 , and they suggest that @xmath232 thus , this version of invariant seems , somewhat regretfully , not to depend on  @xmath233 .",
    "it must not be forgotten however that the presented version of invariant is only the simplest one ( and actually another invariant has been already mentioned in section  [ sec ves ] , before the assumption ) .",
    "an interesting possibility is to map in  @xmath73 not a simplicial complex itself but its _ universal covering _ , in case of a nontrivial fundamental group  @xmath234 .",
