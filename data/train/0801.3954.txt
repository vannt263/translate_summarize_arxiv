    "multi - electron bubbles in liquid helium were first observed by volodin _",
    "et al_.@xcite in their experiment a layer of electrons was held in place just above the free surface of a bath of liquid helium by an electric field .",
    "the field was produced by a positive voltage applied to an electrode immersed in the liquid .",
    "the electrons remained outside the helium because for an electron to enter liquid helium it has to overcome a potential barrier of height approximately 1 ev.@xcite when the field reached a critical value , the surface of the liquid became unstable and a large number of electrons entered into the liquid through the formation of bubbles .",
    "each of these bubbles typically contained @xmath0 electrons .",
    "the multi - electron bubbles are of interest because they could possibly provide a way to study a number of properties of an electron gas on a curved surface.@xcite    as a first approximation , one can consider that the radius of a spherical multi - electron bubble ( meb ) is such as to minimize the sum of the energy associated with the coulomb repulsion of the electrons and the surface energy of the bubble .",
    "this gives an equilibrium radius of @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of electrons , @xmath3 is the surface tension of helium ( 0.36 erg  @xmath4 at 1.3 k),@xcite @xmath5 is the dielectric constant ( 1.0573 at low temperature ) , and the applied pressure has for the moment been taken to be zero .",
    "thus , for example , for @xmath6 the radius is 106 @xmath7 m .",
    "so far , there have been a very limited number of experimental studies of these bubbles.@xcite in this paper we first consider the stability of an meb that is at rest in the liquid ( section ii ) .",
    "we find that , at least when the simplest model of the energy of the electron system is used , the bubble is unstable against fission whenever the applied pressure is positive . in section iii",
    "we investigate how the stability of a bubble is changed when it is moving through the liquid .",
    "we have been able to determine the region in the pressure - velocity plane where the bubble is stable .",
    "since meb s were first observed , there have been several theoretical investigations of the stability of these objects .",
    "the first discussion was given by shikin@xcite and further analysis has been given by salomaa and williams,@xcite and tempere , silvera and coworkers.@xcite in the simplest model , the electrons are taken to be distributed over the inner surface of the bubble in a way such that the electric field is everywhere exactly normal to the surface .",
    "this ensures that the charge distribution is in equilibrium .",
    "the electrons are treated classically and so are localized at the surface in a layer of zero thickness ( see below ) .",
    "thus the total energy of the bubble is taken to be @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the surface energy with @xmath10 the surface area and @xmath3 the surface tension , @xmath11 the volume energy with @xmath12 the applied pressure and @xmath13 the bubble volume , and @xmath14 is the coulomb energy given by @xmath15 since the electrons can move freely around the surface , the field @xmath16 inside the bubble must be zero and so the integral in eq .",
    "( [ coulomb ] ) can be restricted to the region outside the bubble . if the bubble is spherical",
    ", the bubble radius that gives the minimum value of the energy is the solution of the equation @xmath17 for zero applied pressure , this gives the total energy of an meb as @xmath18 since the energy is proportional to @xmath19 the energy is always reduced if the bubble breaks into two . hence , in the discussion of stability given here we are not considering whether the energy of the bubble can be lowered if it breaks into pieces , but are trying to determine whether there is an energy barrier that prevents the bubble from breaking .    to consider whether the spherical shape is stable , write @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that to second order in the parameters @xmath22 , the three contributions to the energy can be written as @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 hence the total energy is @xmath26 where the spring coefficients @xmath27 are given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 . from this one can see that the bubble is stable against spherically symmetric perturbations provided that @xmath31 .",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath32 where @xmath33 for @xmath34 , the spring coefficient @xmath35 is zero ; this is to be expected since a perturbation of the form @xmath36 corresponds to a simple translation of the bubble in some direction . for @xmath37",
    "the spring constant @xmath38 is zero if the pressure is zero , and so this analysis of the effect of small perturbations to the initial spherical shape does not determine the stability of the bubble .",
    "the higher @xmath39 spring constants are all positive at zero pressure but each becomes negative if the pressure is increased to a sufficiently positive value .",
    "it was noted by tempere _",
    "et al_.@xcite that if the pressure is negative ( but not negative with respect to @xmath40 ) , all of the spring constants will be positive@xcite and so the bubble must be stable .",
    "the stability of the bubble at zero pressure is of especial importance since in the experiments that have been performed so far there has been no applied pressure apart from the very small hydrostatic pressure due to the distance the bubble is below the free surface . at",
    "zero pressure @xmath38 is zero , and so we need to go beyond the lowest order in perturbation theory in order to investigate the stability of an meb at zero pressure",
    ". one approach would be to calculate the terms in the energy that are fourth order in the @xmath22 parameters .",
    "instead we have performed numerical calculations of the total energy as a function of bubble shape .    to do this",
    ", we describe the shape of the bubble using eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) but now do not restrict the parameters @xmath22 to being small .",
    "when the bubble shape changes , the electrons will redistribute themselves over the surface so as to minimize the energy and to make the electric field inside the bubble zero .",
    "for each choice of shape we use the finite element method@xcite to compute the surface charge distribution and the coulomb energy .",
    "the simulation uses 1280 triangle patches .",
    "we start with a spherical shape and vary the parameters @xmath22 to see if a state of lower energy can be reached without passing over a barrier .",
    "we have done this using a maximum value of 5 for @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) .",
    "this process was then repeated for a series of different pressures .",
    "we also performed similar calculations with a maximum value of @xmath39 of 15 but taking only @xmath41 .",
    "both procedures gave the same results for the stability .",
    "the result of this investigation is that for all positive pressures there is no barrier to fission , whereas for negative pressures there is a barrier .",
    "this result holds for all values of @xmath2 . to illustrate the path to fission ,",
    "we describe results obtained for a simplified calculation in which only @xmath42 and @xmath37 contributions are retained .",
    "thus we write @xmath43 within this simplified model , fission occurs when @xmath44 and the bubble develops a hole along the @xmath45-axis , i.e. , takes on a donut shape , when @xmath46 . in fig .",
    "[ contouri](a ) , we show examples of contour plots of the energy in the @xmath47-@xmath48 plane . the pressure is @xmath49 mbar and @xmath50 .",
    "there is a stable minimum with @xmath48 equal to zero , i.e. , the bubble is spherical . when the pressure is zero ( fig .",
    "[ contouri](b ) ) , there is still a point in the plane at which the energy of the bubble is stationary with respect to both @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( at @xmath51 m and @xmath52 ) , but it is now possible to reach the fission line from this point without passing over any energy barrier .",
    "note that along this path there is , of course , an increase in the value of @xmath48 but also a substantial decrease in @xmath47 .",
    "once the pressure becomes positive ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ contouri](c ) ) , there is no point in the @xmath47-@xmath48 plane where the energy is stationary .    these results can be compared with the earlier calculations by tempere _",
    "et al_.@xcite who also investigated the stability against fission .",
    "they used an ingenious method in which the bubble was described by 6 parameters chosen so that the shape of a bubble undergoing fission could consist of two spheroids connected by a hyperboloidal neck .",
    "the choice of parameters was such that the bubble could vary from consisting of a single sphere , to an ellipsoid , and then all the way to separated spheres .",
    "they minimized the total energy of the bubble by adjusting these parameters subject only to the constraint that the total length @xmath53 of the bubble had to have a given value .",
    "they then investigated how the total energy varied with @xmath53 starting from a value of @xmath53 equal to @xmath54 .",
    "if the energy decreased monotonically as @xmath53 increased from @xmath54 to a large value , this indicated that the meb was unstable against fission .",
    "if the energy first increases before decreasing , this indicates that the bubble is stable . to simplify the calculation ,",
    "_ made the approximation that the charge density was uniform over the surface of the bubble .",
    "they concluded that at zero pressure even though there is a mode of deformation ( the @xmath37 mode ) which can grow without increasing the energy of the bubble , there should be an energy barrier which prevents fission,@xcite whereas we find no barrier .",
    "this difference in the results arises from the treatment of the charge distribution on the bubble . if the bubble is assumed to have surface charge density that remains uniform when the shape changes , it is straightforward to show that the coulomb energy for small changes from the equilibrium spherical shape is @xmath55 in this case the spring constant @xmath56 for the @xmath39-th mode ( considering only @xmath57 ) becomes @xmath58 comparing this with the spring constant @xmath27 when the charge redistributes ( eq .",
    "( [ springi ] ) ) gives @xmath59 thus for all modes , except @xmath42 and @xmath60 , making the approximation of a uniform surface charge gives an increase in stiffness and makes it harder for the bubble to undergo fission .",
    "the increase in stiffness is to be expected since a redistribution of surface charge can only lower the total energy . in fig .",
    "[ contourii ] , we show energy contour lines in the @xmath47-@xmath48 plane for an meb with @xmath61 electrons at zero pressure calculated by taking a uniform surface charge .",
    "one can see that within this approximation the spherical bubble is stable .",
    "electrons at zero pressure .",
    "the energy spacing between contour lines is 0.05 ev .",
    "the energy is shown as a function of the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ simpleexpansion ] ) .",
    "the electrons are uniformly distributed over the surface area of the bubble . ]",
    "there are several physical effects that are not included in the simplified model used so far .",
    "it is possible that allowance for these effects would change the stability of an meb at zero pressure . a more detailed consideration of the coulomb energy ( the total electron energy , to be more precise ) for a spherical bubble has been given by salomaa and williams@xcite using the density functional formalism of hohenberg and kohn.@xcite this makes possible the inclusion of the kinetic , exchange and correlation energies , but how these extra contributions affect the spring constants is not clear and is difficult to calculate .",
    "salomaa and williams show that these extra contributions to the energy make a very small contribution to the energy when @xmath2 is large .",
    "for example , for @xmath62 the extra terms make a contribution that is roughly 4000 times smaller than the form @xmath63 for the energy used in the simple model .",
    "the calculation could also be improved , for example , by using a density functional theory to treat the surface of the liquid helium , and by allowing for the penetration of the electron wave function into the liquid .",
    "all of these effects appear to be very small corrections to the total energy and hence are unlikely to change the spring constants by a large amount .",
    "however , it is important to note that even a small correction could lead to a positive value for @xmath64 which would in turn lead to a finite ( but small ) energy barrier against fission .",
    "as an example , consider corrections that arise as a result of using a density - functional scheme to describe the helium .",
    "for a bubble with radius large compared to the thickness of the liquid - vapor interface the first correction to the energy can be represented by considering the surface tension @xmath3 to contain a correction that is proportional to the total curvature @xmath65 of the surface .",
    "based on a simple density functional scheme used previously,@xcite it is straightforward to show that the correction to the surface tension is @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and the sign of the correction is such that the surface tension is increased for a concave surface of the liquid .",
    "inclusion of this term changes the total energy by an amount @xmath68 which for a bubble at zero pressure is given by @xmath69 it is straightforward to show that the spring constant for an @xmath37 deformation at zero pressure now becomes @xmath70 because @xmath38 is now positive at zero pressure there will be a barrier against fission , but clearly for large @xmath2 ( e.g. @xmath71 ) , this barrier will be very small .",
    "the above results indicate that one way to stabilize an meb is to produce it in liquid that is under a small negative pressure .",
    "we now consider an alternate way to maintain a stable bubble .",
    "a bubble moving through a liquid will be affected by the local pressure change associated with the liquid moving around it . for a spherical bubble moving at velocity @xmath72 through an incompressible inviscid fluid with density @xmath73 , the bernoulli effect results in a pressure variation over the surface of the bubble",
    "which is given by@xcite @xmath74 for a bubble in liquid that is at zero pressure far removed from the bubble ( @xmath75 ) , this changes the shape of the bubble in two ways .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath76 by itself would provide a negative pressure around the surface of the bubble and since bubbles are stable at negative pressure , this contribution serves to stabilize the bubble .",
    "the second term gives a positive pressure at the poles of the bubble and a negative pressure around the waist .",
    "this pressure distribution will distort a spherical bubble so as to make the parameter @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) , or @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ simpleexpansion ] ) , to be negative .",
    "this tends to stabilize the bubble since , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ contouri ] , for fission to occur @xmath48 has to become positive .",
    "we have performed computer simulations in order to find the shape of moving bubbles and the range of velocity and pressure for which they are stable .",
    "we start with a guess at the bubble shape and then calculate the charge distribution on the surface .",
    "this then gives the pressure @xmath78 exerted on the surface by the electrons .",
    "we then find the flow in the liquid . to do this we expand the velocity potential as @xmath79 where @xmath80 are some coefficients and the sum includes terms from @xmath60 to @xmath81 .",
    "the coefficients are determined so as to give a velocity distribution in the liquid such that in the frame of reference of the moving bubble , the liquid velocity at the bubble surface in the direction normal to bubble surface is as close to zero as possible .",
    "this gives a pressure at the bubble surface of @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the pressure in the bulk liquid far removed from the bubble and @xmath84 is the bernoulli pressure .",
    "the net inward force acting on unit area of the bubble surface is then @xmath85 where @xmath65 is the total curvature of the surface and @xmath86 is the outward pressure exerted by the electrons .",
    "each part of the bubble surface is then moved inward a distance proportional to this force , and the process repeated until the equilibrium shape is found .",
    "the calculation used a maximum value of @xmath39 of 15 .",
    "the calculation as just described is based on the assumption that the bubble shape and velocity field have axial symmetry around the direction in which the bubble is moving . in order to test this assumption , we also performed a calculation in which axial symmetry was not assumed . this calculation used values of @xmath39 up to 5 and @xmath87 .",
    "this calculation showed that the axially symmetric shape was stable .",
    "for an meb with @xmath50 shapes for three velocities are shown in fig .",
    "[ shape ] .",
    "we are able to perform the numerical calculation until the bubble becomes concave at the poles .",
    "this is shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "electrons for bubble velocities of 3 , 10 and 20 cm  s@xmath88 . ]     from the bubble center to the poles and the radius @xmath89 of the waist as a function of the bubble velocity .",
    "these results are for a bubble containing @xmath61 electrons moving through liquid in which the pressure at large distance from the bubble is zero . ]    in fig .",
    "[ shapeparameter ] , the distance @xmath90 from the bubble center to the pole and the radius @xmath89 of the waist are shown as a function of the velocity . in fig .",
    "[ phase ] we show a plot of the region in the pressure - velocity plane in which the bubble is stable .",
    "this region is bounded by two lines . for small velocities",
    "there is a critical positive pressure at which the bubble undergoes fission . at negative pressures",
    "the bubble becomes unstable against expansion . for zero velocity",
    "this expansion is isotropic .",
    "note that the change in the shape of the bubble even for a small velocity is surprisingly large .",
    "this comes about simply because the bernoulli pressure contains a finite term varying with angle as @xmath91 but the spring constant @xmath38 for this pressure component is zero .",
    "thus , for an meb the changes in @xmath90 and @xmath89 are linearly proportional to the bubble velocity whereas for a gas bubble in a liquid the spring constant @xmath38 is finite and so the changes in dimensions are proportional to the square of the velocity .",
    "electrons is stable .",
    "the region is bounded by the lines on which the two different types of instability occur as described in the text . along the dashed line",
    "the bubble becomes concave at the poles and the numerical calculations become inaccurate .",
    "]    the region of stability of bubbles containing a different number of electrons can be found by scaling the results shown in fig",
    ".  [ phase ] .",
    "the instability pressure @xmath92 can be written in the form @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a dimensionless function , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "thus , for zero velocity the critical negative pressure at which a bubble becomes unstable is proportional to @xmath97 , and at zero applied pressure the critical velocity at which the bubble becomes concave at the poles occurs is proportional to @xmath98 .",
    "we note that in this paper we have treated the liquid as inviscid although , of course , helium above the lambda point has a finite viscosity and below the lambda point the liquid still has a normal fluid component . at sufficiently low temperatures",
    "the density of the normal fluid becomes very small and , in addition , the mean free path of the excitations making up the normal fluid becomes comparable to the radius of an meb . under these conditions , it appears that the only effect of the normal fluid is to determine the mobility of an meb and there should be no effect on the shape change or the stability . for a bubble with @xmath50 the mean free path of the thermal excitations becomes equal to the radius at around 0.6 k and at this temperature the normal fluid density is less than the total density by a factor of @xmath99 . but",
    "as far as we are aware , there have been no experiments with meb s at low temperature .    at high temperatures where the helium is in the normal state ,",
    "the situation is not so clear .",
    "it is known that when the reynolds number is large ( but not so large that the flow becomes turbulent ) the viscosity results in a thin boundary layer on the surface of the bubble and the pressure at the bubble surface is close to the value that would result from potential flow.@xcite this general idea would suggest that the inviscid approximation should give reliable results for the stability of meb s over a wide range of reynolds number . to determine this range one could calculate the effect of viscosity using the method developed by li and yan@xcite and applied by them to calculate the shape and drag on gas bubbles moving through a liquid .",
    "we have not attempted to do this .",
    "we note that , albrecht and leiderer@xcite in their experiments at 3.5 k found that the mobility of the meb s was between one and two orders of magnitude larger than expected on the basis of ordinary hydrodynamics .",
    "the reason for this is unknown .    in the experiments of volodin",
    "_ _ et al.__@xcite and khaikin@xcite which were performed at 1.3 k , velocities of the order of @xmath100 cm  s@xmath88 were reported . at these velocities",
    "the normal fluid component would be in the turbulent regime and the bubble is moving so fast that it should lose energy through the production of quantized vortex rings .",
    "we have examined the stability of multi - electron bubbles in liquid helium and found that stationary bubbles at positive pressures are unstable .",
    "we show that because of the bernoulli effect moving bubbles can be stable even at small positive pressures .",
