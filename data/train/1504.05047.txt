    "ever since its experimental realization , synthetic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in ultracold atomic gases has attracted much attention  @xcite . over the past few years",
    ", soc - induced exotic phases and phase transitions have been extensively studied in both the bose and the fermi gases  @xcite .",
    "central to the effects of soc in these systems is the nonperturbative modification of the single - particle dispersion spectra . for fermi gases in particular",
    ", the soc - modified single - particle dispersion can induce exotic few - body states  @xcite as well as highly nontrivial many - body correlations  @xcite .",
    "the soc - induced fulde - ferrell ( ff ) pairing state is an interesting example where the interplay of soc and the zeeman - field - induced fermi surface asymmetry stabilizes unconventional pairing superfluids with finite center - of - mass momenta  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that an alternative ff pairing mechanism exists in a fermi - fermi mixture where a two - component noninteracting fermi gas , while dressed by soc , interacts spin selectively with a third fermionic species  @xcite .",
    "as the hyperfine - spin distribution in the soc - induced helicity branches is asymmetric in momentum space , the spin - selective pairing interaction leads to pairing states with finite center - of - mass momenta in both the two - body and the many - body sectors .",
    "this novel pairing mechanism is thus fundamentally different from the majority of existing proposals of soc - induced ff states since it is originated from spin - selective interaction and does not require a fermi - surface asymmetry .    in this paper , we extend this exotic spin - selective - interaction - induced ff mechanism to a three - component fermi gas where all three hyperfine states are coupled by soc  @xcite . from the single - particle dispersion , we show that in the three soc - induced helicity branches , two exhibit asymmetric hyperfine - spin distributions . based on this asymmetry , we discuss several different configurations of the spin - selective interactions , under which the ground state of the system can either be a conventional bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) state with zero center - of - mass momentum or be ff states originating from the interplay of soc and pairing interaction .",
    "in particular , an interesting three - component ff state can be identified in which every two out of the three hyperfine components form ff pairing with a common center - of - mass momentum .",
    "we investigate the stability and phase transitions of the three - component ff states by mapping out the mean - field phase diagram .",
    "depending on the excitation gap of quasiparticles , the ff states in the present system can be further categorized as gapless or fully gapped .",
    "we characterize the gapless ff states by studying the gapless contours in momentum space and discuss their relation with features in the number distribution , which should facilitate experimental detection . as the various configurations of interaction can in principle be experimentally implemented via the feshbach resonance technique , our paper not only reveals the generality of the ff pairing mechanism induced by soc and spin - selective interactions , but also has interesting implications for future experiments on soc - induced exotic superfluidity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [ 2 ] , we calculate the single - particle dispersion under soc and analyze the inherent asymmetry in the hyperfine - state distribution . in sec .  [ 3 ] , we present the system as well as the mean - field formalism .",
