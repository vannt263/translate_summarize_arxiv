    "as it is well known , the low - energy dynamics of electrons in graphene @xcite is described by the dirac equation in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most direct confirmation of the pseudorelativistic character of electron motion in graphene is given by the experimental observation @xcite of the anomalous quantum hall ( qh ) effect theoretically predicted in refs .",
    "the anomalous qh plateaus are observed at the filling factors @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the landau level ( ll ) index .",
    "the factor 4 in the filling factor is due to a fourfold ( spin and sublattice - valley ) degeneracy of each qh state in graphene .",
    "the presence of the anomalous ( from the viewpoint of more standard condensed matter systems ) term @xmath3 in the filling factor unmistakably reveals the relativistic - like character of electron motion in graphene @xcite .",
    "the later experiments @xcite in strong magnetic fields ( @xmath4 ) observed new qh plateaus , with integer filling factors @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the more recent experiments @xcite discovered additional plateaus , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . while the latter corresponds to the fractional qh effect",
    ", the plateaus with @xmath9 , and @xmath7 are intimately connected with a breakdown of the @xmath10 symmetry of the low - energy effective quasiparticle hamiltonian in graphene ( connected with the spin and sublattice - valley degeneracy mentioned above ) @xcite . strictly speaking ,",

    "the observed new qh plateaus @xmath9 , and @xmath7 occur clearly due to the electron - electron interaction leading to ( quasi-)spontaneous @xmath10 symmetry breaking that removes the degeneracy of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 lls .    for the description of the new qh plateaus , the following two theoretical scenarios were suggested .",
    "one of them is the qh ferromagnetism ( qhf ) @xcite , whose order parameters are the spin and valley charge densities ( the dynamics of a zeeman spin splitting enhancement considered in ref .",
    "@xcite is intimately connected with the qhf ) .",
    "this scenario is related to the theory of exchange - driven spin splitting of lls @xcite .",
    "the second one is the magnetic catalysis ( mc ) scenario , whose order parameters are excitonic condensates , responsible for the generation of the dirac masses of charge carriers @xcite .",
