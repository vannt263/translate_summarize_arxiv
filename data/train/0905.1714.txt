    "when fine and hyperfine structures are involved , they also become sensitive to variations of the fine structure constant @xmath1 and nuclear @xmath15-factor @xmath16 .",
    "there were several proposals of microwave experiments with diatomic molecules .",
    "rotational microwave spectra were used numerous times to study time variation of fundamental constants in astrophysics .",
    "however , all such lines have same dependence on fc , @xmath17 , so one needs to use reference lines with different dependence on fc . in the microwave band",

    "all these four reference lines were used in combination with some rotational lines to put strong limits on variation of fc @xcite .",
    "if the hydrogen 21-cm line is used as a reference for 18-cm oh line , the combination of constants , which is constrained , has the form @xcite : @xmath31 the most tight limit on the variation of @xmath32 was obtained from observations of the absorber at the redshift @xmath33 and the @xmath34 gravitational lens , ref .",

    "sensitivity coefficient for these lines were found in ref .",
    "they appeared to be rather different from those of the lowest @xmath0-doublet line .",
    "therefore , it is possible to use different @xmath0-doublet lines of the oh molecule to place a limit on the variation of fundamental constants without using reference lines of other species .",
    "this can help to eliminate systematic effect from the different velocity distributions of different species in molecular clouds .",
    "two lowest @xmath0-doublet lines of ch molecule ( 9 cm and 42 cm ) were detected in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "recently christian henkel and karl menten suggested that these lines can be used for astrophysical search of the time - variation of fundamental constants @xcite .",
    "there are also several other light molecules with @xmath0-doubling , where microwave spectra were observed in the interstellar medium .",
    "for example , first extragalactic microwave rotational spectra of no were observed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we decided to study sensitivities of the @xmath0-doublet lines to the variation of the fundamental constants in a more systematic way .",
    "astrophysical studies of variation of fundamental constants require accurate knowledge of the laboratory frequencies . in the microwave band",
    "it is not so rare that the accuracy of the astrophysical observations is higher than the accuracy of the respective laboratory measurements .",
    "therefore , some of the recommended `` laboratory '' frequencies are actually recalculated from astrophysical spectra ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this method is based on the assumption that different lines from the same distant object have the same redshifts .",
    "thus , the redshift is first determined from one set of lines and then is used to find rest frame frequencies of the other set of observed lines .",
    "the logic in these works is opposite to the one used in the search of the variation of fc . in such a search one",
    "looks for the difference in the _ apparent _ redshifts of the lines from the same object and compare these differences to the sensitivities of respective lines to variation of the constants to get information on constant variation .",
    "recently the laboratory frequencies of all four hyperfine components of the 18  cm line of oh molecule were measured with a record precision @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "also , the frequencies of all three components of the 9 cm @xmath0-doublet line @xmath37 in ch molecule were recently remeasured in ref .",
    "@xcite with the accuracy of 0.1 ppm , or better ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this opens possibility to study variation of fundamental constants at the level below 1  ppm .",
    "such studies can supplement the limits on @xmath2-variation based on the observations of the ammonia inversion line @xcite because @xmath0-doublet lines are sensitive to variation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while ammonia line is sensitive only to @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , as we will show below , because of the decoupling of the electron spin from the molecular axis , the sensitivity coefficients here strongly depend on the rotational quantum numbers .",
    "therefore , if more than one line is observed , it may be possible to obtain model independent limits on variation of both constants .",
    "sensitivity to the third constant @xmath16 is typically much weaker , except for some low frequency lines where hyperfine contribution to transition frequency becomes significant .",
    "if such lines are observed , it is possible to make _ full _ experiment and constrain variation of _ all three constants .",
    "_    additional motivation to the present work comes from rapid progress in laboratory experiments with cold and ultracold molecules .",

    "the most recent developments in this field are summarized in the review @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we estimate sensitivity coefficients of different @xmath0-doublet lines to variations of constants @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the analysis is basically the same for all light molecules in the @xmath39 , or @xmath40 states .",
    "we include several of them here , for which there is sufficient data in the databases of microwave molecular spectra @xcite .",
    "we use this data to find parameters of the effective spin - rotational hamiltonian and to calculate sensitivity coefficients .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of the diatomic radicals in doublet states @xmath39 , or @xmath40 .",
    "let us define dimensionless sensitivity coefficients to the variation of fc so that : @xmath41    dimensionless sensitivity coefficients @xmath42 are most relevant in astrophysics , where lines are doppler broadened , so @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is velocity variance and @xmath45 is the speed of light .",
    "the redshift of a given line is defined as @xmath46 .",
    "frequency shift leads to the change in the apparent redshifts of individual lines .",
    "the difference in the redshifts of two lines is given by : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the average redshift of both lines and @xmath49 , etc .",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ redshifts1 ] ) in terms of the variation of a single parameter @xmath32 : @xmath50 the typical values of @xmath44 for the extragalactic spectra is on the order of few km / s .",
    "this determines the accuracy of the redshift measurements on the order of @xmath51 ",
    "@xmath52 , practically independent on the transition frequency .",
    "therefore , _ the sensitivity of astrophysical spectra to variations of fc directly depend on @xmath53_.    in optical range sensitivity coefficients are typically on the order of @xmath54 ",
    "@xmath55 , while in microwave and far infrared frequency regions they are typically on the order of unity .",
    "in fact , as we will see below , in some special cases sensitivity coefficients can be much greater that unity .",
    "this makes observations in microwave and far infrared wavelength regions potentially more sensitive to variations of fc , as compared to observations in optical region . because of the lower sensitivity , systematic effects in optics may be significantly larger ( for the most recent discussion of the systematic effects see @xcite and references therein ) .    in sec .",

    "it is possible to compare microwave spectra for molecular clouds from our galaxy with extragalactic spectra of the same species . in many cases the line widths for the galactic spectra are one - two orders of magnitude smaller , than for objects at cosmological distances ,",
    "so they can serve as very good reference .",
    "let us briefly discuss the feasibility of the laboratory tests of time - variation of fc using molecular @xmath0-doublets .",

    "to improve constrained one needs to measure frequency shifts @xmath167 .",
    "for the 18 cm oh line this corresponds to the shift @xmath168  hz .",
    "this is few orders of magnitude smaller than the accuracy of the best present measurements @xcite . on the other hand , at present there is rapid progress in precision molecular spectroscopy caused by development of sources of ultracold molecules ( see review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thus it is possible that molecular tests of fc variation using @xmath0-doublet lines can become competitive in the near future .",
    "when comparing sensitivity of different laboratory experiments on time - variation it is not sufficient to look for large dimensionless sensitivity coefficients . in high precision laboratory measurements",
    "the line widths are not dominated by the doppler effect and are not proportional to the frequency . because of that , instead of the dimensionless sensitivity coefficients @xmath42 , which determine relative frequency shifts , one has to look for large absolute sensitivities @xmath169 , which determine absolute frequency shifts @xmath170 and for narrow lines . in astrophysics , on the contrary ,",
    "all lines are doppler - broadened and dimensionless sensitivity coefficients @xmath42 become crucial .",

    "<S> for example , sensitivity coefficients for the @xmath0-doublet lines @xmath6 of the @xmath7 state of oh molecule are on the order of @xmath8 . </S>"
