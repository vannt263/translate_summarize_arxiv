    "it is known that an increased nuclear binging is caused by the presence of large energy gaps in the single - particle ( s.p . ) nuclear spectra .",
    "the large gaps result in a decreased average density of s.p .",
    "levels and influence binding energies through the so - called shell effects . these effects can be further enhanced by high degeneracies of the s.p .",
    "levels above and/or below the energy gaps , which results in even larger fluctuations of the average level densities .",
    "such degeneracies , in turn , are consequences of the conservation of certain symmetries in the s.p .  hamiltonian .",
    "ordinary doubly - magic nuclei , for example , are spherically symmetric , i.e.characterized by degenarcies corresponding to the rotational group @xmath1 , and indeed the most strongly bound .",
    "apart from the group of rotations , there exist only two other relevant symmetry groups whose conservation leads to s.p .",
    "degeneracies higher than the two - fold kramers degeneracy .",
    "one of them is the point group , @xmath2 , of the regular tetrahedron , which yields two - fold and four - fold degenerate s.p",
    ".  levels . on this basis , li and dudek@xcite suggested in 1994 that stable nuclear shapes characterized by the tetrahedral symmetry may exist in nature .    the lowest - rank multipole deformation which does not violate the @xmath2 symmetry is @xmath0@xcite .",
    "it represents a shape of a regular tetrahedron with `` rounded edges and corners '' , and is usually called tetrahedral deformation . by using the deformed woods - saxon potential , several authors@xcite examined the s.p .",
    "energies in function of @xmath0 , and found that , indeed , large energy gaps , sometimes larger than the spherical ones , open up at neutron / proton numbers of n / z=16 , 20 , 32 , 40 , 56 - 58 , 70 , 90 - 94 , 100 , 112 , 126 or 136 .",
    "they are sometimes referred to as tetrahedral magic numbers . in the vicinity of the tetrahedrally doubly - magic nuclei defined in this way ,",
    "strutinsky shell - correction calculations were performed@xcite , and energy minima corresponding to the tetrahedral deformation were found in even - even @xmath3zr , @xmath4zr , @xmath5yb , @xmath6rn , and @xmath7fm .",
    "similarly , the hartree - fock+bcs ( hf+bcs ) calculations @xcite , found tetrahedral solutions in @xmath3zr , and hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb ) tetrahedral solutions in @xmath3zr and @xmath4zr were reported in refs.@xcite and @xcite , respectively .    the present paper reports on the first systematic study of the tetrahedral deformation in various regions of the nuclear chart , carried out by means of self - consistent methods .",
    "we focus our study on properties of the tetrahedral minima , mainly their energies and deformations , and analyze their dependence on the skyrme force parameterizations .",
    "the hfb method was used .",
    "four parameter sets of the skyrme interaction were taken in the particle - hole channel : sly4@xcite , skm*@xcite , skp@xcite , and siii@xcite .",
    "for the description of pairing , procedures of ref.@xcite were followed .",
    "the density - dependent delta interaction in the form of @xmath8 was employed , with the saturation density , @xmath9=0.16@xmath10 , and strengths of @xmath11=@xmath12285.88 , @xmath12233.94 , @xmath12213.71 , and @xmath12249.04mev@xmath13 for sly4 , skm * , skp , and siii , respectively .",
    "the densities were constructed out of quasi - particle states with equivalent - spectrum energies@xcite up to 60mev . in order to study effects of pairing , the hf calculations were also performed for comparison .",
    "reflection symmetries in two or three perpendicular planes were imposed , correspondingly , when looking for the tetrahedral and quadrupole solutions .",
    "the calculations were carried out by using the code hfodd ( v2.11k)@xcite , which expands the quasi - particle wave - functions onto the harmonic - oscillator basis .",
    "bases of 14 and 16 spherical shells were taken for the zr and heavier elements , respectively .",
    "six nuclei , doubly - magic with respect to the tetrahedral magic numbers , were examined : @xmath14zr@xmath15 , @xmath16zr@xmath17 , @xmath18zr@xmath19 , @xmath20ba@xmath19 , @xmath21yb@xmath22 , and @xmath23th@xmath24 . in all of them , the hf and hfb energy minima corresponding to the tetrahedral shapes were found with all the examined forces , apart from a few exceptions .",
    "the found solutions are characterized by the @xmath0 deformations ranging from 0.08 to 0.26 , and admixtures of @xmath25 and @xmath26 deformations in proportions that preserve the tetrahedral symmetry@xcite , and with values of @xmath25 ranging from about 0.01 to 0.07 .",
    "deformations of higher multipolarities were found to be negligibly small . as expected for the tetrahedral symmetry , the hf s.p .  and",
    "hfb quasi - particle spectra are composed of two - fold and four - fold degenerate levels . in the six nuclei in question , spherical , oblate , prolate , and triaxial solutions were also found , depending on the nucleus , as discussed below .",
    "three quantities that characterize the obtained tetrahedral solutions will be examined : the energy difference , @xmath27 , between the tetrahedral ( @xmath28 ) and lowest quadrupole ( @xmath29 ) minima , the energy difference , @xmath30 , between the spherical point ( @xmath31 ) and tetrahedral minimum , and the deformation @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath32 gives an idea of the excitation energy of the tetrahedral states above the ground state .",
    "@xmath30 is important for the following reason . both from the previous self - consistent studies in @xmath3zr@xcite , as well as from our preliminary results for @xmath33zr",
    ", it seems that , at least in the zr isotopes , there is no energy barrier between the spherical and tetrahedral solutions .",
    "energy in function of @xmath0 looks rather like the dependence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , obtained from the hfb calculations in @xmath34zr with the siii force .",
    "one can see that @xmath30 measures the depth of the tetrahedral minimum against changes in @xmath0 , and thus provides information on whether a stable tetrahedral deformation or rather tetrahedral vibrations about the spherical shape should be expected .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the energy minima for selected nuclei and forces as points on the @xmath35-@xmath36 plane . in each panel , all the found hfb solutions ( plus symbols , upper - case labels ) are shown , while the hf solutions ( circles , lower - case labels ) , are given only for the tetrahedral and spherical cases .",
    "the labels denote the tetrahedral ( @xmath28 , @xmath37 ) , spherical ( @xmath31 , @xmath38 ) , oblate ( @xmath39 ) , prolate ( @xmath40 ) , and triaxial ( @xmath41 ) solutions .",
    "one of the principal observations resuilting from our calculations is that various skyrme forces may give significantly different energetical positions of the tetrahedral solutions with respect to the quadrupole minima .",
    "this is most pronounced for the sly4 and skm * results in @xmath3zr ( two upmost panels in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , which give the tetrahedral minima of about 3mev below and above the lowest quadrupole state , respectively .",
    "the extremal values of @xmath27 predicted by various forces for each nucleus studied here are collected in table 1 . they do not depend much on whether pairing is included or not .",
    "the differences between the maximum and minimum values are of the order of a few mev .",
    "one can see , nevertheless , that @xmath27 is lowest in zr isotopes , where some forces even predict the tetrahedral solution to be the ground state .",
    "values of @xmath27 are particularly large , not smaller than 7mev , in @xmath42ba and rather moderate , even about 3mev , in @xmath5yb and @xmath43th .",
    "further important point is that the depths of the tetrahedral minima , @xmath30 , are reduced by pairing .",
    "this can be seen from the comparison of the hf and hfb results for @xmath34zr and @xmath42ba ( four central panels in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the reductions may be as significant as from 3 to 1mev in @xmath34zr with skm * , while for skp the inclusion of pairing suppresses the tetrahedral minimum in @xmath34zr altogether .",
    "the decrease in @xmath30 is mainly due to the lowering of the energy at the spherical point , i.e. , the pairing influences the spherical state more than the tetrahedral one .",
    "this is so because the s.p .",
    "energy gaps at the fermi level are bigger in the latter case , as already discussed in the introduction . in @xmath3zr with siii , for instance , pairing vanishes at the tetrahedral minimum , and remains non - zero at the spherical point .",
    "predictions concerning the destructive role of pairing strongly depend on the details of the method , as well .",
    "the hf+bcs @xcite and hfb@xcite calculations for @xmath3zr , both using the siii force , yielded @xmath30 of 0.7mev and several tens of kev , respectively . the corresponding result of our calculations is about 2mev .    in the current analysis",
    ", we also obtain differences in predictions of various skyrme forces as to the values of @xmath30 , both with and without pairing . in the hfb results for @xmath34zr , for example",
    ", @xmath30 varies from about 0.4 for sly4 to 2mev for siii , not counting skp .",
    "the hf and hfb results for other studied nuclei are summarized in table 1 . in @xmath43th ,",
    "no spherical solutions , and in @xmath5yb no spherical hfb solutions were found , so that the corresponding values of @xmath30 could not be calculated . in @xmath42ba , the tetrahedral hfb solution was obtained with only one force , skm*. however , the hf results exhibit a clear trend that @xmath30 increases with the mass number",
    ". it can be as small as a few tens of kev in zr isotopes , and as large as 7mev for @xmath5yb with skm*. the problem of stability of the tetrahedral minima can be even more complicated because of a possible softness of the nuclei in question against the octupole deformations other than @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the four skyrme forces used in our study also give somewhat different values of the @xmath0 deformation , see table 1 .",
    "the inclusion of pairing slightly reduces these values , along with @xmath30 .",
    "heavier isotopes have larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "hartree - fock - bogolyubov solutions corresponding to the tetrahedral deformation were found in six tetrahedrally doubly - magic nuclei : @xmath3zr , @xmath44zr , @xmath34zr , @xmath42ba , @xmath5yb , and @xmath43th .",
    "results with four skyrme forces , sly4 , skm * , siii , and skp , sometimes significantly differ in the values of @xmath0 , depths of the tetrahedral minima , and their energies with respect to the co - existing quadrupole solutions .",
    "the inclusion of pairing reduces the depths , or even suppresses the existence of the tetrahedral minima . in zr isotopes ,",
    "the tetrahedral minima are rather shallow , but some forces predict them as the lowest in energy . in @xmath42ba , they are not lower than 7mev above the quadrupole solutions , but in @xmath5yb and @xmath43th that minimum distance is reduced to 3mev .",
    "tetrahedral minima in @xmath42ba , @xmath5yb , and @xmath43th are estimated to be deeper than in the zr isotopes .",
