    "over the last 20 years , high resolution infrared imaging techniques have provided precise astrometric measurements of stellar sources at the galactic center . focused astrometric monitoring campaigns have revealed a population of mostly young early - type stars ( the s - cluster ) in orbit about the location of the radio and infrared source dubbed sagittarius a * ( sgr a * ) .",
    "in fact , @xcite and @xcite both analyze their own distinct data sets to deduce a mass of @xmath6 located coincident with sgr a*. this mass must all be within the periapsis of the star s16/s0 - 16 , which is only  40 au .",
    "the implied mass density provides compelling proof that sgr a * is the luminous manifestation of an accreting black hole .",
    "in addition to providing a measurement of the mass of sgr a * , the orbits of the stars also provide a direct measurement of the distance to the black hole , @xmath7 kpc @xcite .",
    "if sgr a * actually resides at the dynamic center of the milky way , then measuring its distance also represents a measurement of the solar distance from the galactic center ( @xmath8 ) . monitoring stellar orbits about sgr a * also provide a measurement of the sun s peculiar motion in the direction of the galactic center ( @xmath9 ) . as discussed by @xcite , @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "are ubiquitous parameters in the description of the structure and dynamics of the milky way ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "uncertainty in the values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the largest sources of error in the determination of the ratio of the galactic halo s long and short axes ( @xmath10 , * ? ? ?",
    "the parameter @xmath10 is sensitive to different galaxy formation scenarios and dark matter candidates , and if @xmath8 and @xmath9 were known at the @xmath11 level , the constraints on @xmath10 would help to differentiate theories of galaxy formation and dark matter @xcite .",
    "in addition , a very precise knowledge of @xmath8 could affect our calibration of the lowest rungs of the cosmic distance ladder by improving our distance measurements to galactic sources such as cepheids and rr lyrae variables@xcite .",
    "the existence of the s - cluster is intriguing because it is rich with young stars and because forming these stars in situ represents a theoretical problem given the strong tidal forces in the region .",
    "the alternative of formation at larger radii and subsequent migration is strongly constrained by the deduced young age of the stars . however , because the s - stars are known to be younger than the relaxation time in the environment ( a b star s main - sequence lifetime is @xmath12 years compared to the relaxation time of @xmath13 years ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) their orbits should encode some information about the kinematics of the cluster at the time it formed .",
    "thus , perhaps as a bonus , astrometric monitoring of the stars in our galaxy s nuclear cluster has the potential to inform the community not only on matters of general relativity and galaxy formation , but also on star formation in extreme environments .",
    "the deduced mass and distance of sgr a * make it the largest black hole on the sky , in terms of angular diameter , and an excellent candidate for study .",
    "improving astrometric measurements and discovering stars on even shorter period orbits will improve our understanding of the gravitational potential which binds the stars , possibly exposing a dark matter cusp at the center of our galaxy , and should inform our understanding of gravity on scales not yet explored by precise experiments .",
    "for example , @xcite modeled a distribution of stars on very short period orbits about sgr a * and showed that post - newtonian effects on the orbital paths could be detected with the astrometric precision and sensitivity of a future thirty - meter telescope . existing and upcoming near - ir interferometers can provide even better resolution , and enable some of the same science .",
    "in their treatment @xcite assumed gaussian point spread functions , which tend to zero in the wings faster than the more realistic airy pattern which distributes light in rings away from the central core .",
    "these rings present a contrast barrier in conventional imaging .",
    "likewise , the even more complicated point spread functions ( psfs ) provided by interferometers result in contrast and detection limits and can bias astrometric measurements .",
    "@xcite showed that halo noise and source confusion are the factors limiting astrometric accuracy .",
    "these effects , which are both related to the angular resolution of the telescope and the luminosity function of the sources in the region ( i.e. the dynamic range ) , present a fundamental astrometric hurdle which can not be overcome with even the largest single aperture telescopes of today @xcite .",
    "in fact , simulations by @xcite and @xcite showed that astrometric errors could be as large as 3 milliarcseconds due to confusion with undetected sources .",
    "this level of astrometric uncertainty , present close to sgr a * where stars experience the deepest part of the potential , has precluded the detection of any post - newtonian effects on stellar orbits to this point and has limited the precision with which the distance to the galactic center can be measured .",
    "the limiting magnitude and astrometric precision of galactic center observations has improved as early speckle observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were supplemented by adaptive optics ( ao ) and laser guide star ao ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the current state of the art is a limiting magnitude of @xmath1419 at k and an astrometric precision of @xmath15as .",
    "however , these limits are only achieved far from the crowded central region immediately surrounding sgr a*. in this paper we investigate whether , with the increased resolution of infrared interferometers and the concomitant reduction in confusion , we can detect heretofore undetected or unnoticed stars on orbits with very short periods within 50 mas of sgr a*. we also explore the astrometric precision with which such sources could be monitored with an ir interferometer . according to @xcite a factor of @xmath16 more stars with periods",
    "less than 20 yrs are expected to be orbiting sgr a*. these stars , if they can be detected and monitored , will provide a detailed description of the central potential ( a minimum of three short - period orbits are required for a complete characterization ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , such stars will provide the best targets for observing general relativistic effects since they are deepest in the potential well of sgr a*.    although the higher resolution provided by interferometry is beneficial for increasing the detectability of sources in the crowded region and for increasing the astrometric precision attainable , there are many potential complicating factors which do not apply to conventional full aperture imaging .",
    "for example , in full aperture imaging , collecting area increases as the square of the resolution . in interferometers , however , the collecting area is independent of the effective spatial resolution .",
    "this means that although the confusion limit is somewhat alleviated by the higher angular resolution available , photon noise quickly becomes a problem in the detection of faint sources .",
    "this fact is further exacerbated by the low typical throughput of interferometers ( e.g. , @xmath17 for the keck interferometer ) .",
    "additionally , the sparse nature of an interferometer s collecting area results in an incomplete sampling of the fourier components of the source distribution on the sky .",
    "this causes an incomplete knowledge of the sky - plane light distribution resulting in psfs with large sidelobes .",
    "finally , michelson interferometers like the keck interferometer and the vlt interferometer ( vlti ) have small fields of view , @xmath0 mas , which typically only include a single object ; clearly this presents difficulty for astrometry .",
    "we attempt to understand the scale of these effects by simulating data and inferring results .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the construction of mock star fields within 50 mas of the galactic center . in section 3",
    "we discuss our observation simulator and all included sources of noise and uncertainty .",
    "section 4 covers our algorithm for making relative astrometric measurements by fitting to the visibility curves .",
    "section 5 includes a presentation of our results .",
    "section 6 provides a discussion of the potential advances and difficulties .",
    "although we try to keep the discussion general , we focus on astra at the keck interferometer as we are most familiar with that instrument and it is currently capable of making these observations .",
    "we also provide a discussion of vlti gravity @xcite simulations .",
    "interferometric observations of the galactic center will be conducted through the k band . we construct mock star fields in orbit about the black hole at the galactic center using as much information about the number of sources and the distribution of k band magnitudes as is available .",
    "previous observations , while limited by confusion noise , have provided a wealth of information regarding the stellar population and k - band luminosity function ( klf ) of the central cluster .",
    "@xcite showed that the klf of the inner 1.5 `` around sgr a * is well fit by a power law with a slope of @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite , for example , used this luminosity function normalized to the photometry of @xcite of the stars within 0.8 '' of sgr a * to extrapolate the population of stars even closer to the galactic center .",
    "additionally , some clues about the content of the confused region can be gleaned from observations of well - monitored stars stars on orbits which spend most of their time outside of the confused region when they pass through the confused region during their orbital periapsis .",
    "for example , when the star s0 - 2 passed through periapsis in 2002 its centroid was offset from its fitted orbital path .",
    "this offset strongly suggests a confusion event with an undetected source ( or multiple undetected objects ) . by measuring the offset and the ellipticity , or lack thereof , of the s0 - 2 psf during 2002 ,",
    "some constraints on the unseen source(s ) can be derived ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "further , both @xcite and @xcite provide analyses of sgr a * light curves and show a median magnitude in k - band of @xmath19 16 and a minimum magnitude of @xmath19 17 . while absolute photometry in the region is complicated by confusion noise",
    ", we use the analyses of sgr a * lightcurves to normalize two separate star fields for use in our study . in our first star field ,",
    "field1 , we set the flux from sgr a * equal to its median observed value , the flux from the brightest star in the field we set to be consistent with the minimum observed flux from the region as reported in @xcite and @xcite , and we include three fainter stellar sources consistent with an extrapolation of the klf reported in @xcite ( see their table 2 ) .",
    "to be cautious , we also model a second star field in which we have decreased the flux of each source by one magnitude .",
    "this fainter star field we call field2 .",
    "we believe that these two fields should encompass a fair representation of the true source distribution very close to sgr a*.    while we took care that our star fields are consistent with available observations , the true source content within 50 milliarcseconds is unknown .",
    "the potential to further constrain the stellar content within the region is one the scientific motivations for observing the galactic center with long - baseline infrared interferometers .",
    "we assigned spectral slopes to our sources to be consistent with the observed slopes of sources near the galactic center , namely @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "the spectral slope of sgr a * was taken to be @xmath22 ( tuan do , private communication ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "while we modeled sgr a * as stationary , the stellar sources were assigned random keplerian orbits with semi - major axes in the range of 0.1 - 400 au .",
    "we chose this range of semi - major axes to coincide with the confused region around sgr a*. any source with a larger semi - major axis should leave this region , and would likely have been detected in previous ao observations . table [ orbittable ]",

    "interferometers combine light from a source collected at more than one aperture , forming an interference pattern .",
    "this interference pattern encodes high spatial frequency information of the light distribution under observation .",
    "the maximum spatial frequency which can be detected by an interferometer can be expressed succinctly as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the wavelength of the observation and @xmath25 is defined as the projection of the vector connecting the two apertures onto the plane of the sky in the direction of observation .",
    "the interference pattern of light created by a monochromatic source can be described as @xmath26 or @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the incident power from each aperture , @xmath30 is the wave number , @xmath31 is the relative path - length delay between the two apertures , and @xmath32 is the complex visibility ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the polychromatic case is slightly more complicated , and a brief discussion of the effects of a finite bandwidth on interference fringes will help elucidate some of the challenges of practical interferometry . in general , astronomical sources radiate polychromatic light such that each wavelength of light is mutually incoherent with every other wavelength .",
    "the result of this mutual incoherence is that polychromatic fringes are a sum of fringes produced by each individual wavelength of light . since a fixed @xmath31 will result in a different phase offset between the two apertures for each wavelength of light ( i.e. @xmath33 ) , it is impossible to keep fringes arising from different wavelengths of light in phase everywhere .",
    "polychromatic fringes are only present in the neighborhood of zero delay and are attenuated as @xmath31 increases .",
    "in fact , the fringes are attenuated by an envelope function which takes the shape of the fourier transform of the spectral bandpass . for the case of a top - hat bandpass centered at @xmath34 and with a width of @xmath35 ,",
    "the envelope takes the shape of a sinc function , and fringes are detected inside the coherence length @xmath36 for a typical case of five spectral channels in the k band , @xmath37 ( see table [ spectable ] ) .",
    "this imposes a strict requirement on the implementation of interferometric measurements .",
    "in general , the path lengths of light incident on different telescopes must be similar to within @xmath38 before being combined if fringes are to be observed at all .",
    "even more strictly , @xmath31 must be less than @xmath39 if the central unattenuated  white - light \" fringe is to be observed .",
    "this necessitates delay lines to precisely correct for the optical path length difference between the two apertures .",
    "further , the existence of a coherence envelope also imposes a restriction on our field of view . for a michelson interferometer the field of view",

    "if an exposure time of longer than @xmath45 is required , the delay lines at the interferometer , which are responsible for keeping @xmath46 , can not only compensate for sidereal motion or else fringes will be smeared ; atmospheric delay must be detected and corrected for dynamically .    because the galactic center is faint ,",
    "a dual field system is required to incorporate a bright reference star for fringe tracking . in dual field phase referencing ( dfpr )",
    "a field separator is used to create two beam trains , one with a bright reference source and one with a fainter science target .",
    "similar to natural guide star adaptive optics , light from the bright reference star is used to detect and measure the differential atmospheric delay .",
    "these measurements are enabled by the high flux of the reference source , which allows for short exposures of less than @xmath47 .",
    "precise metrology is required for the application of a dual field system .",
    "delay line commands need to be precise on the order of a fraction of the fringe spacing , which is typically @xmath48 microns for our scenarios observing in the k band . also important",
    ", a precise baseline measurement is needed to perform the conversion from delay offset of the reference fringes to a delay line command in the science beam .",
    "the situation is complicated since there are two beamtrains , each with distinct path lengths which must be measured continuously to monitor fluctuations due to thermal drifts and other effects .",
    "visibility measurements entail measuring the amplitude and phase of interference fringes using a light detector .",
    "any corruption of fringe amplitude , fringe phase , or flux levels on the detector must be taken into account .",
    "below we describe all such influences considered .",
    "a fringe - tracker measures the phase of the fringes in the reference beam and sends corrections to delay lines .",
    "the finite servo bandwidth in the fringe - tracker will cause the observed fringes to be smeared , and lowering the observed amplitude by a factor which we take to be : @xmath49 consistent with the performance of phase referencing at the palomar testbed interferometer @xcite .    in dfpr the reference source and the science target are observed through different portions of the atmosphere , each with slightly different piston aberrations ( anisopistonism , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus the assumption that light from the science target can be held in phase by monitoring the phase of the brighter reference source will introduce an error .",
    "this error will smear the fringes and reduce the modulus of the visibility .",
    "the size of this effect is discussed in @xcite and @xcite and is given as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the isopistonic angle given by @xcite , and @xmath52 is the angle to the reference star .",
    "after the cophased beams are combined , the light passes through single - mode fiber optic cables and then to the camera .",
    "fibers respond best to on - axis sources and transmit only a fraction of the light from off - axis sources .",
    "this reduces the observed flux of each source by a factor of @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the fiber function defined below and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the position of each source relative to the phase center .",
    "we model the fiber response function as achromatic with a gaussian function having a full width at half maximum of 55 milliarcseconds : @xmath57    pointing errors also affect our astrometric precision . in interferometry , pointing errors are manifest as phase errors in the complex visibilities .",
    "we account for phase errors arising from a handful of instrumental effects primarily related to measuring and monitoring the baseline and internal paths .",
    "we label the combined contribution of these effects @xmath58 .",
    "another phase error that affects our ability to point arises due to the different paths light from separate sources take through the atmosphere .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the uncertainty in the observed phase of interferometric fringes can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the projected baseline in meters , @xmath52 is the angular separation between the science target and a reference source in radians , and @xmath61 is the integration time in seconds .",
    "this relationship is calibrated using models of the atmosphere above mauna kea .",
    "we combine the two sources of phase error to produce a total pointing error : @xmath62    we measure the visibility amplitude and phase using the four - bin abcd algorithm @xcite . in the abcd algorithm the average intensity in each quarter",
    "fringe ( a , b , c , and d ) is measured and used to deduce the complex visibility .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the visibility can be calculated according to : @xmath63 and @xmath64    since each measurement a through d is a flux measurement , each is susceptible to normal photometric uncertainties including strehl fluctuations , photon noise , and readout noise .",
    "we assume @xmath65 injection fluctuations , which account for strehl variations and for the variable coupling of speckles from bright sources beyond our field of view into the fiber ( speckle coupling ) .",
    "we assume an average strehl in the k band of 35% . while this value of the strehl is consistent with typical values in previous laser guide star ao observations (",
    "e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it may represent an optimistic estimate for performance with astra .",
    "this is because reported strehl ratios in the literature are likely to be biased high by frame selection . in our simulations , a reduced strehl ratio will result in a lower level of flux in the fringes . in our results",
    "section below , we demonstrate how our performance scales with flux by modeling two starfields which are identical except that in one all source fluxes have been scaled by one magnitude .",
    "bright stars on the periphery of our field of view also have the potential to affect our simulated visibilities .",
    "this is because , as shown in table [ spectable ] , the interferometric coherence envelope extends out to a radius @xmath66 mas and because the fiber will have at least some response there .",
    "we assume that such bright sources at large radii have already been detected with laser guide star ao observations and that their effect on our visibilities could be modeled out accordingly .",
    "we report our modeled background flux levels in each spectral channel in table [ visparams ] .",
    "they are based on observed background performance using the keck interferometer fringe tracker ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the read noise , @xmath67 ,",
    "is taken to be 10 counts , consistent with the performance of the hawaii arrays at keck .",
    "thus we take the uncertainty in each read in each spectral channel to be @xmath68 where @xmath69 indexes each source in the field ,",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 are he position of each source on the fiber , @xmath72 is the flux on each aperture emanating from each source , and @xmath73 is the background flux .",
    "the exposure time @xmath74 is the time spent on each read , and @xmath75 and @xmath76 are sampled values of the injection fluctuations drawn from a gaussian distribution of standard deviation @xmath77 .",
    "our modeled observational setup uses 60 five - second subreads per 300-second block .",
    "each subread includes one second of integration on each fringe quadrature and one second on a bias frame .",
    "a summary of our simulator parameters can be found in table [ visparams ] .      in the previous section",
    ", we described the magnitude of several corrupting influences including several random noise sources .",
    "actual values for each of these random sources of noise must be realized before we can produce our simulated fringes .",
    "we assign to the variable @xmath78 a sampled value of the random pointing error drawn from a gaussian distribution of width @xmath79 .",
    "for each aperture we draw a value for the random injection fluctuation from a gaussian of width @xmath77 ; we assign these values to the variable @xmath80 , where @xmath81 indexes the aperture .",
    "finally , we generate a value , @xmath82 , for the detection noise by drawing from a gaussian distribution of width @xmath83 .",
    "next , we combine the random noise sources with calculated values for @xmath84 , the fiber attenuation function , and the visibility of each individual point source to model and measure the fringes as follows @xmath85 where the amplitude and phase of the fringes are specified by the complex visibility given by @xmath86 here @xmath87 is the complex visibility of a point source ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the resulting uv - coverage and psf for the keck interferometer is shown in figure [ keckbeam ] .",
    "the psf is narrow , @xmath105 mas at half maximum , along the direction of the interferometer baseline , but extended in the perpendicular direction . because of the distinct shape of the keck interferometer psf , we will measure astrometry much more precisely along the baseline than in the orthogonal direction .",
    "the extended wings or sidelobes of the psf will have the tendency to overlap when the separation between sources has only a very small component along the baseline direction .",
    "such overlapping sidelobes bias astrometric measurements ( see below ) .",
    "however , within @xmath0 mas of the galactic center , where stars are expected to be orbiting with periods @xmath106 year and @xmath107 bright sources are expected in the field , multi - epoch observations with the keck interferometer stand a good chance of observing the sources with significant separation along the baseline angle ( see section [ keckresults ] below ) .",
    "the extended wings of the keck interferometer psf shown in figure [ keckbeam ] will result in a restricted contrast limit .",
    "this is because flux from a bright source is distributed throughout the field in the wings of the psf . to be detectable in the vicinity of a bright source",
    ", a faint source must be brighter than the noise in the wings .",
    "our adopted vlti observing routine provides the uv - coverage shown in the left panel of figure [ vltbeam ] .",
    "the increased uv - coverage provided should have an easier time distinguishing sources in a crowded field .",
    "there are four free parameters for each source in the field : position ( @xmath108,@xmath109 ) , flux , and spectral slope . for real data",
    ", the number of sources in the field will not be known a priori . in order to efficiently search the large parameter space for a best fit to the synthesized data",
    ", we implement a hybrid grid fit and levenberg marquardt ( lm ) minimization algorithm to minimize the @xmath110 function of the parameters given the synthesized data .    the interferometric visibility produced by a distribution of point sources is expected to be undulating versus baseline ( figure [ visfig ] ) and thus the @xmath110 surface in the @xmath111 plane is expected to be similarly undulating ( see figure [ chisurfkeck ] for a slice through the range of the @xmath110 function in the @xmath111 plane ) .",
    "since the levenberg marquardt algorithm is a gradient fitting algorithm which always proceeds  downhill \" from an initial starting point which must be supplied by the user the undulating nature of the @xmath110 surface can present a problem because the lm algorithm will converge on a local minimum if the initial parameters are not in the neighborhood of the global minimum .",
    "we have therefore adopted a grid - based approach to ensure that starting values supplied to the lm fitter sample the @xmath110 surface well enough to ensure at least one seed begins in the neighborhood of the global minimum . since local minima on the @xmath110 surface mirror local maxima in the psf , local minima will be separated by about the interferometer fringe spacing .",
    "thus , we used a grid spacing of @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the shortest wavelength observed and @xmath114 is the longest projected baseline used .",
    "figure [ chisurfkeck ] shows our grid of seed parameters .",
    "to begin , we start with a model consisting of two point sources . for the fit , we seed an lm fitter with a grid of starting locations ( shown in figure [ chisurfkeck ] ) and a guess of the flux and spectral slope of each source .",
    "we then use the best - fit values of this fit together with an additional grid of starting locations to seed a 3-source model fit .",
    "this process can then be repeated to fit for any number of sources .",

    "for our simulated keck interferometer observations of the orbiting star field field1 , we adopt a two - year observing routine that includes two three - night observing runs per year , one in the spring and one in the late summer . in figure [ 1epoch1mag ] we show our fitted source positions as well as the input positions for one of the nights .",

    "the astrometric precision in our fits can be estimated in three ways .",
    "first , we are able to characterize the quality of fits by computing the true residuals ( right panel of figure [ field1orbit ] ) .",
    "second , by assuming no significant orbital motion over the three - day time period , the dispersion in fitted positions over consecutive nights provides a rough measure of the astrometric precision for each observing run .",
    "lastly , in figure [ field1select ] we show calculated error ellipses generated using a standard bootstrapping algorithm .    bootstrapping randomly re - samples the data , with replacement , several times and re - runs the fitter on each new sample .",
    "the process of drawing and replacing ensures that for most resampled data sets some of the data is redundant and some of the original data is missing .",
    "when our source fitter is run on the re - sampled data sets , a range of fitted parameter values are returned .",
    "the spread in the returned parameter values defines the shape of the uncertainty ellipses .",
    "in figure [ field1select ] we split the recovered positions shown in the left panel of figure [ field1orbit ] into two plots , the left showing the results from the first year and the right plot showing the results from the second year of observation .",
    "we also show the astrometric error ellipses derived via our bootstrapping routine .",
    "as expected based on the shape of the keck interferometer psf ( figure [ keckbeam ] ) , our ability to accurately recover the position of the star depends on the position angle between the star and sgr a*. during the first year ( left panel of figure [ field1select ] ) , star 1 is well separated in the direction of the baseline from sgr a * and the astrometric residuals are @xmath15as along the baseline direction and @xmath116mas in the perpendicular direction . in the second year",
    "( right panel ) when star 1 and sgr a * are not well separated in the direction of the interferometer baseline , our astrometry is poor as indicated by the larger spread in fitted positions over the three - night runs , the larger residuals , and the significantly larger error ellipses derived for the epochs shown in [ field1select ] .",
    "this is due , as discussed above , to overlapping sidelobes .",
    "the distinct shape of the bootstrap error ellipses which are much narrower in the direction of the interferometer baseline than in the direction perpendicular , reflects the shape of the keck interferometer psf which has similar features .",

    "[ snfield1 ] we show an upper limit to the signal - to - noise ratio for each source in field1 .",
    "to compute the values in table [ snfield1 ] we made some simplifying assumptions to help elucidate some of the issues without the application of a more opaque formal treatment .",
    "namely , we assume that there is no flux attenuation from the optical fiber and that each source is the only source present in the field .",
    "these two assumptions imply that our signal - to - noise ratios are strict upper limits .",
    "for example , a source with a reported upper limit to the signal - to - noise ratio of 10 or greater may provide no detectable signal in the presence of photon noise from brighter nearby sources or if the signal of an - off - axis source is attenuated by the optical fiber response . additionally , including only one source in the field",

    "however , small values do ensure non - detections .",
    "we list signal - to - noise values for each source with and without injection fluctuations .",
    "the large change in the upper limit to the signal - to - noise ratio when injection fluctuations are included indicate that they introduce a large source of noise .",

    "the accuracy and the precision of the recovered source positions in panel 3 are somewhat degraded compared to the recovered positions in panels 1 and 2 .",

    "thus , as in the keck case discussed above , there is a tug - of - war of considerations affecting the detectability of a source in the vicinity of sgr a*. faint sources are more easily detected outside of the 1% contours of the psf . because of the fiber attenuation function , when sources are far from the center of the field their flux level is likely to drop below the detection limit ( @xmath127 in six hours ) .    while more beam splits reduce the number of photons combined between each pair of telescopes at vlti , the trade off is significantly increased uv - coverage .",
    "in fact , the confusion limit for gravity will be better than for astra at keck . in figure [ vltconfusionfig ] , as in figure [ confusionfig ] for the astra , we attempt to isolate the contribution of source crowding to the confusion noise by observing star fields with more and more equal magnitude stars . as in figure",
    "[ confusionfig ] , we start with sgr a * at @xmath4 and one star with @xmath120 .",
    "we then add one @xmath120 star at a time until a total of four stars are in the field .",
    "since the vlti provides good uv - coverage of the galactic center , precise astrometry on even five bright sources within @xmath0 mas of sgr a * is possible .",
    "since table [ vltsnfield1 ] indicates that gravity will be unable to recover stars 3 and 4 due to inadequate signal - to - noise , we also tested the performance on a brighter star field labeled field0 .",
    "field0 is identical to field1 but with the flux of each source increased by one magnitude .",
    "our fits are plotted in figure [ vltfield0 ] .",
    "we are again able to recover the positions sgr a * , star 1 and star 2 for three out of four runs . during the run when star 2 is farthest off axis",
    "we again run into some difficulty , because our fitter interchanges star 2 and star 3 .",
    "this is due to the effects of the fiber response function which attenuates the flux from star 2 most during this run while star 3 remains at a nearly constant brightness near the center of the field .",
    "the interchange is a result of our iterative fitting algorithm .",
    "this interchange does not affect the results of multi - epoch observations which can track the sources and identify the switch .",
    "star 3 in field0 is recovered only less than half of the time , indicating that the star is only marginally detectable in the data and suggesting a sensitivity limit around @xmath127 .",
    "even so , these results imply the potential to detect and monitor several moderately bright sources within @xmath0 mas of sgr a * should they exist .",
    "in section [ resultssec ] , our keck interferometer astra simulations show the ability to detect and track a stellar source on an orbit within @xmath0 mas of sgr a * with a single baseline interferometer .",
    "this performance depends on the source contrast and position angle with respect to sgr a*. however , we demonstrate the potential to detect and track an @xmath1 star when sgr a * is at @xmath117 and the star and sgr a * are well separated along the baseline direction ( left panel of figure [ field2select ] ) .",
    "we show that @xmath128as astrometry is possible along the baseline direction and @xmath16 mas precision is possible in the transverse direction during unconfused epochs .",
    "our precision improves if the sources are brighter .",
    "since a single baseline interferometer produces an extended psf , confusion still affects our ability to accurately detect and track sources when their sidelobes overlap .",
    "while at first glance astra seems quite limited compared to gravity in its ability to detect and track stars within @xmath0 mas of sgr a * , we show that the single baseline instrument could significantly contribute to the galactic center science case .",
    "specifically , we show that multi - epoch observations have the ability to distinguish whether the region contains no bright sources , one or two bright sources , or several bright sources ( see figures [ field1select ] , [ field2select ] , and [ confusionfig ] ) .",
    "since the source content in the region is truly unknown , any additional information about the stellar density near the galactic center would be quite valuable .",
    "new information could inform , for example , dynamical theories of the nuclear cluster which must explain the positions of the stars .",
    "further , the higher throughput , larger apertures , and fewer beam splits provide a larger signal in the astra fringes ( compare for example tables [ snfield2 ] and [ vltsnfield2 ] ) . while confusion noise will constrain astra observations , if no star brighter than @xmath127 exists in the field astra may have an advantage in making a detection . because astra is currently capable of making these observations the potential exists to provide the community with some constraints before gravity comes online at the vlti and before astra operations cease at keck .",
    "while long - term operations of astra are not currently planned , we note that if astra and gravity observations could be obtained contemportaneously , some importvement in the recovery of faint sources may be possible . in simulations where we combined astra and gravity data ( using the assumptions in table [ visparams ] for each instrument )",
    ", we found that we can recover the @xmath129 source in some epochs where it is not recovered using either astra or gravity data alone .",
    "our gravity simulations show that that instrument will attain a lower confusion limit than astra .",
    "this lower confusion in gravity observations is due to the increased uv - coverage provided by the vlti array .",
    "this makes it possible to detect and monitor multiple sources in the field .",
    "we demonstrate the potential for @xmath3as precision astrometry on sgr a * at @xmath4 and @xmath122as precision astrometry on sources as faint as @xmath5 in six hours of observing our simulated star fields . however , we show that the decreased throughput at gravity and the larger number of beam splits required to create six baselines will impose a detection limit at gravity which will make it difficult to detect sources at @xmath130 .",
    "in fact , we show that for one simulated three - night run using gravity , we are unable to recover the position of the @xmath5 source . while this reflects contrast and fiber function issues to some extent , it shows that in real observations gravity may struggle to detect sources at this brightness level .",
    "gravity s ability to recover precise astrometry for multiple sources within @xmath0 mas from sgr a * suggests it should be able to constrain the shape of an extended mass distribution at the galactic center@xcite .",
    "any model of the central structure must include the mass of the black hole and the mass and radial profile of an extended distribution of matter . to constrain these parameters and to break the first - order degeneracy between the retrograde precession due to the extended matter and the prograde precession attributable to general relativity",
    ", multiple stars with distinct angular momenta will be needed @xcite .",
    "since the astrometric signal of orbital precession increases linearly with the number of revolutions , monitoring stars on short - period orbits within @xmath0 mas is preferred , since a larger signal can be detected in shorter time .",
    "our gravity simulations also demonstrate the astrometric precision needed to detect relativistic effects on stellar orbits .",
    "our simulated performance of @xmath122as suggests that low order effects of relativity , such as the prograde precession , will be detectable @xcite .",
    "however , higher order relativistic effects , such as detecting the influence of the black hole spin on stellar orbits , will be more difficult , requiring measurements more precise than those demonstrated here@xcite .    a recent paper by @xcite modeled the imaging mode astrometric performance of gravity , applying the clean algorithm to images formed using the interferometric visibilities .",
    "in that paper , the authors mainly investigate the astrometric precision attainable on sgr a * when it is very bright .",
    "they compare their performance after a whole night of observing to individual 100 second exposures .",
    "they show that @xmath131as precision is attainable on sgr a * in 100 seconds when it is very bright and the field is simple .",
    "our simulations show that astrometric precision on the order of the angular extent of the inner - most stable circular orbit of the black hole ( @xmath132as ) is attainable on sgr a * even in the midst of our more complicated star field .",
    "however , @xmath3as precision is attained after 6 hours of observing ; time resolved astrometry in our fields will necessarily be less precise . not only are shorter observations less sensitive to sources in the field , but with less time spent on - source the uv - coverage is reduced . both of these effects combine to degrade the astrometric precision by decreasing the signal - to - noise ratio and increasing the confusion .",
    "we demonstrate that as astrometry on sgr a * becomes more difficult due to confusion with bright stars in the small field , astrometry on those bright stars becomes easier .",
    "thus gravity should provide some traction on investigating general relativistic effects , either through observations of sgr a * itself given a faint star field or by tracking stars in the vicinity of sgr a * given a brighter star field .",
    "although our simulations did not include sgr a * variability explicitly , variability could provide an interesting paradigm for making these observations . during high states",
    ", we will be able to conduct precise astrometry of sgr a * , anchoring our field . during low states ,",
    "the decreased contrast will provide an opportunity to probe for fainter stellar sources in the region .",
    "this back - and - forth approach could be harnessed to precisely monitor faint sources . to demonstrate these effects , we ran our simulator with sgr a * set to very low brightness but with the star field magnitudes kept constant . during these runs",
    ", we were able to recover stellar positions more easily , since confusion with sgr a * was reduced . on the other hand ,",
    "a very bright sgr a * is easily detected with a high level of precision .",
    "the timescales of sgr a * variability are conducive to seeing both high and low states while observing .",
    "flares are observed on timescales of @xmath133 minutes and sgr a * often changes flux by more than one magnitude .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that astra and gravity will be able to provide different insights into the star field near sgr a*. the keck instrument will excel if the inner @xmath0 mas is a simple field , with a steep luminosity function including at least one relatively bright star .",
    "we demonstrate the ability to recover a source with @xmath118 in a field with other similarly bright sources and we show in table [ snfield2 ] that a source as faint as @xmath129 might be detected if the star field is faint and the visibility amplitude is high .",
    "multi - epoch observations will be necessary to mitigate source confusion as the astrometry will be most precise when the star orbits through position angles where the astrometric offset along the projected baseline direction is large .",
    "gravity s sensitivity to sources will not depend strongly on orbital phase as is the case with astra since gravity provides a more symmetric psf",
    ". moreover , gravity will be better able to track orbits if the stellar field has a shallower luminosity function , as it is not as affected by confusion noise and because it will have difficulty detecting sources fainter than @xmath127 .",
    "the minimal uv - coverage provided by the single baseline of the keck interferometer , which is furthermore situated in the northern hemisphere where sgr a * transits low , is not insufficient for providing valuable information for scientific advance .",
    "in fact , we demonstrate the ability to detect and monitor stars when there is sufficient astrometric offset along the baseline direction .",
    "these results could be extended to infer the performance of a single baseline of the vlti .",
    "given the technical and practical challenges of using all four vlt apertures to create six baselines , it is important to consider that even a reduced array at vlti could make important contributions to galactic center science . because the vlti is situated in the southern hemisphere where sgr a * transits high , even a single baseline of the vlti would provide much more uv - coverage of sgr a * than keck .",
    "if no bright stars are detected in the region , then a reduced array could be used to provide more photons in each fringe , increasing the sensitivity of the interferometer at the expense of a more extended psf , which would even so be less extended than the keck interferometer psf we show above .",
    "moving forward , further gravity simulations incorporating a variable sgr a * and stars on post - newtonian orbits will be useful in the interim before that instrument comes online .",
    "such simulations will aid in predicting the challenges of characterizing the gravitational potential at the galactic center with stellar orbits and in creating the necessary analysis tools which will be needed for fitting the complicated orbits which are expected to be observed .",
    "finally , some interferometric observations of galactic center sources have been made at keck and the vlti ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite observed irs 7 with the vlti and showed it is suitable for use as a phase reference source ; similar observations have been made with the keck interferometer .",
    "dual field phase referencing has been demonstrated on - sky with astra ( woillez et al . in prep ) , and the instrument is poised to observe the field around sgr a*. an obvious next step is to actually observe sgr a * and to search for real sources .",
