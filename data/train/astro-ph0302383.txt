    "many observations have been carried out to determine the chemical abundances in dwarf irregular galaxies ( dirrs ) ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they show a wide scatter both in metal abundances and in abundance ratios ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) . in spite of this , the metal distribution inside some of the galaxies is rather homogeneous ( e.g. , ngc  1569 : @xcite @xcite ; i  zw  18 : @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "metals produced in high - mass stars ( hmss ) and intermediate - mass stars ( imss ) polute different gas phases . due to the diverse energy contents of supernovae ( sne ) and planetary nebulae ( pne ) their mass releases are stored in the hot intercloud medium ( icm ) or the cold cloudy medium ( cm ) , respectively .",
    "the cm - bound metals remain in the galactic body , while sn ejecta might leave the gravitational field of the galaxy .",
    "some hydrodynamic simulations have shown on the one hand that galactic winds are able to expel the sn  ii - ejected gas ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) while in contrast others ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) allow the gas to be kept in the gravitational field of dirrs if an extended gaseous halo exists . @xcite ( @xcite ) and @xcite ( @xcite ) describe scenarios where the gas leaves the galaxy but rains back to other locations .",
    "additionally , @xcite ( @xcite ) have observed regions e.g. in ngc  5253 with larger nitrogen and oxygen abundances what can be explained by local self - enrichment .",
    "we have performed self - consistant chemodynamical evolution simulations .",
    "the code distinguishes between two gas phases necessary to investigate the separated n and , respectively , o contamination and the abundance mixing processes .",
    "three stellar mass ranges are treated to distinguish the different stellar properties for the element release . additionally to gravitation all relevant mass and energy exchange processes between stars and gas and",
    "the gas phases themselves are taken into account such as star formation , stellar mass loss and death , evaporation , condensation , drag forces , cloud - cloud collisions and radiative ionisation as well as e.g. radiative cooling of the gas .",
    "details of these simulations can be found in @xcite ( @xcite ) . the chemodynamical treatment , its basic network of interaction processes and the numerical code are descriped in detail in the comprehensive paper by @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the galaxy starts from a protogalactic gas cloud with a plummer - kuzmin density distribution ( satoh 1980 ) and a baryonic mass of about @xmath0 within a static dark matter halo according to @xcite ( @xcite ) of @xmath1 .     and z - height @xmath2 , i.e. the whole visible galaxy . the sizes of the ellipses are not scaled correctly according to the mass of the components and have to be interpreted merely as a hint .",
    "the size of the mass flow pipes correspondes to the value of the mass exchange rate.,width=377 ]",
    "here we focus on the different mass exchange processes acting within the galactic body . fig .",
    "[ flow_irr ] shows all relevant processes for the _ irregular phase _ of the dirr model ( see also @xcite @xcite where a different chemodynamical simulation was presented ) . on the top right - hand side",
    "the `` infall '' of cm from the gaseous outskirts into the galactic body is shown . in combination with evaporation and outflow of hot gas a large - scale cycle of mass flow",
    "is produced , because the icm reaches the enveloping hi - halo where condensation rate exceeds evaporation .",
    "therefore , the cycle is closed .",
    "it is important to notice that local self - enrichment by pne occurs in the forming disk , because the time for evaporation and blow out the complete cm ( roughly @xmath3 ) exceeds @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the icm phase contains much less mass ( some @xmath5 ) , the complete icm gas is condensated onto the cm or blown out on a rather short timescale .",
    "some of the sn ii ejecta flow out directly , while another part leaves the galaxy not until it follows a detour through cm phase and evaporation process into icm again . in total , only about @xmath6 of the sn ii metals are poluting the cm locally , while the rest is leaving the galactic body through icm outflow .",
    "we divide the passage of gas and its metal content into three cycles :",
    "while pne stay almost completely in the local sf regions , the chemodynamical dirr simulations have shown that more than half of the sn ii ejecta leave the galactic body before they reenter the inner , observable regions again .",
    "this _ delayed recycling _ has a distinct influence on the chemical evolution , especially on the ratio of nitrogen ( n ) to oxygen ( o ) .    taking up - to - date stellar yields into account ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , o is almost completely processed in hmss while n is produced both in hmss but mostly in imss . in early evolutionary stages with lower metallicities",
    "only a small fraction of n originates from hmss while e.g. for @xmath7 about @xmath8 of a single stellar population s n yield is ejected by sne ii ( secondary n production ) . comparing delayed recycling with instantaneous local mixing the n / o ratio is shifted to higher values up to about 1.0 dex .",
    "this effect is due to the o deposition and separated analytically from other dynamical and evolutionary influences , e.g. the different lifetime of hmss and imss which also influences the n / o ratio significantly ( see e.g. @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "it has a particular importance for very metal - poor systems , but varies with the evolutionary phase as well as with global dynamical processes going on . therefore chemodynamical models which consider all relevant dynamical and energetical processes can provide a fundamental insight into matter exchange and metal deposition in these sensitively balanced galaxies .",
