    "granular materials , a term coined to classify assemblies of macroscopic dissipative objects , are ubiquitous in nature and play a major role in many industrial and technological processes .",
    "interestingly , when a rarefied granular system is vibrated some of its properties are similar to those of molecular fluids , while others are unique and have no counterpart in ordinary fluids @xcite .",
    "a spectacular manifestation of this difference can be observed in a driven mixture of granular particles : if one measures the average kinetic energy per particle , proportional to the so called granular temperature , one finds the surprising result that each species reaches a different value .",
    "such a feature , observed in a recent experiment @xcite , is in sharp contrast with the experience with other states of matter . at a more fundamental level",
    "such a behavior is in conflict with the zeroth law of thermodynamics .",
    "this principle states that when two systems globally isolated are brought into thermal contact they exchange energy until they reach a stationary state of mutual equilibrium , characterized by the same value of their temperatures .",
    "a corollary to such a principle is the statement that the thermal equilibrium between systems a and b , i.e. @xmath0 , and between a and c ( @xmath1 ) implies the thermal equilibrium between b and c @xcite .    on the contrary ,",
    "when two granular system a and b subject to an external driving force exchange energy they may reach in general a mutual equilibrium , characterized by two constant but different granular temperatures @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in addition even when a and c are in equilibrium at the same temperature @xmath4 and b and c also have the temperature @xmath4 one can not conclude that a and b would be in mutual equilibrium at the same temperature . in other words , one of the most useful properties of the temperature , i.e. the independence from the thermal substance is lost when one deals with granular materials .",
    "in the present paper we shall investigate the properties of a simple model of two component granular mixture .",
    "the motivation of our study relies in the fact that granular materials being mesoscopic objects are often constituted by assemblies of grains of different sizes and/or different physical and mechanical properties .",
    "the study of granular mixtures has attracted so far the attention both of theoreticians @xcite and of experimentalists @xcite . in particular garz and dufty",
    "have studied the evolution of a mixture of inelastic hard spheres in the absence of external driving forces , a process termed free cooling because associated with a decrease of the average kinetic energy of the system , i.e. of its granular temperature . during the cooling of a mixture , which can be homogeneous or not , according to the presence of spatial density and velocity gradients",
    ", each species may have different granular temperatures , although these may result asymptotically proportional , i.e. they might decrease at the same rate .",
    "menon and feitosa instead studied several mixtures of vibrated inelastic grains and reported their failure to reach the same granular temperature .    in the present paper",
    "our interest will be concentrated on the statistically stationary state obtained by applying an energy feeding mechanism represented by a stochastic driving force .",
    "the most widely used model of granular materials is , perhaps , the inelastic hard sphere model ( ihs ) @xcite , which assumes the grains to be rigid and the collisions to be binary , instantaneous and momentum conserving . the dissipative nature of the collisions is accounted for by values less than @xmath5 of the so called restitution coefficient @xmath6 .",
    "even such an idealized model represents a hard problem to the theorist and one has to rely on numerical methods , namely molecular dynamics or event driven simulation , or to resort to suitable truncation schemes of the hierarchy of equations for the distribution functions .",
    "one of these schemes is represented by the boltzmann equation based on the molecular chaos hypothesis , which allows to study the evolution of the one - particle distribution function .",
    "its generalization to the two component mixture of inelastic hard spheres has been recently considered by garz and dufty .",
    "our treatment will depart from previous studies , because we have chosen an even simpler approach based on the so called gases of inelastic ( pseudo)-maxwell molecules .",
    "these gases are natural extensions to the inelastic case of the models of maxwell molecules  @xcite , where the collision rate is independent of the relative velocity of the particles .",
    "such a feature greatly simplifies both the analytical structure of the boltzmann equation and the numerical implementation of the algorithm simulating the gas dynamics .",
    "although the constant collision rate is somehow unrealistic one may hope to be able to capture some salient features of granular mixtures , and in particular to reach a better understanding of their global behavior , because the model lends itself to analytical studies .",
    "this type of approach to granular gases had recently a surge of activity since the work of ben - naim and krapivsky  @xcite , our group  @xcite , ernst and coworkers  @xcite and cercignani and collaborators  @xcite , and is providing a series of new important results concerning the energy behavior and the anomalous velocity statistics of granular systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we define the model and deduce the associated boltzmann equations governing the evolution of the velocity distribution functions of the two species and set up their moment expansion ; in section 3 we shall the exact values of the stationary granular temperatures ; in section 4 we consider the moments up to the eighth order and compute the distribution functions by means of the so called sonine expansion . in section 5",
    "we simulate on a computer the dynamics of the inelastic mixture and compute numerically the distribution functions and compare these with the theoretical predictions .",
    "finally in 6 we present our conclusions .",
    "in the following we shall consider a mixture of maxwell inelastic molecules subject to a random external driving .",
    "let us consider an assembly of @xmath7 particles of species @xmath5 and @xmath8 particles of species @xmath9 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume the velocities @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , to be scalar quantities .",
    "the two species may have different masses , @xmath12 and @xmath13 and/or constant restitution coefficients which depend on the nature of the colliding grains but not on their velocities , i.e. @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the mixture evolves according to the following set of stochastic equations :    @xmath16    where the total force acting on particle @xmath17 is made of three contributions : the impulsive force , @xmath18 , due to mutual collisions , the velocity dependent force , @xmath19 , due to the friction of the particles with the surroundings and the stochastic force , @xmath20 , due to an external random drive .",
    "since we are interested in the rapid granular flow regime , we model the collisions as instantaneous binary events , similar to those occurring in a hard sphere system .",
    "the presence of the frictional , velocity dependent term in addition to the random forcing @xcite , not only mimics the presence of friction of the particles with the container , but also is motivated by the idea of preventing the energy of a driven elastic system ( @xmath21 ) , to increase indefinitely .",
    "let us observe that in the absence of collisions the velocity changes are described by the following ornstein - uhlenbeck process :    @xmath22    where the stochastic acceleration term is assumed to have a white spectrum with zero mean :    @xmath23    and variance :    @xmath24    by redefining the bath constants @xmath25 and @xmath26 , it is straightforward to obtain the probability distributions of the velocity of each species , @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , the fokker - planck equations associated with the process ( [ driv ] ) :    @xmath28    possess the following stationary distribution functions :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 represents the temperature of the heath - bath , that we fix to be the same for the two species @xcite .    in order to represent the effect of the collisions on the evolution of the system we assume that the velocities change instantaneously according to the rules :    [ collision ] @xmath31\\frac{m_{\\beta}}{m_{\\alpha}+ m_{\\beta}}(v^{\\alpha}_i - v^{\\beta}_j ) \\\\",
    "v^{'\\beta}_j & =   v^{\\beta}_j+ [ 1+r_{\\alpha \\beta}]\\frac{m_{\\alpha}}{m_{\\alpha}+m_{\\beta}}(v^{\\alpha}_i - v^{\\beta}_j)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the primed quantities are the post - collisional velocities and the primed are the velocities before the collisions .",
    "a finite fraction of the kinetic energy of each pair is dissipated during a collision . between collisions the velocities perform a random walk due to the action of the heat - bath .",
    "the typical time @xmath32 between particle - particle collision is assumed to be large compared to the time between random kicks .",
    "on the other hand the typical time scales associated with the bath are @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "when @xmath35 we must also take @xmath36 in performing the elastic limit , otherwise the kinetic energy would diverge asymptotically .",
    "in fact in section v we shall discuss the situation of inelastic particles with vanishing friction , a case already considered in refs .",
    "@xcite @xcite .",
    "the evolution equations for the probability densities of finding particles of species @xmath37 with velocity @xmath38 at time @xmath39 for the system subject both to external forcing and to collisions are simply obtained by adding the two effects :    @xmath40    where the collision integrals @xmath41 consist of a negative loss term and a positive gain term respectively :    [ prob ] @xmath42    where @xmath43 . in writing eqs .",
    "( [ prob ] ) we have assumed that the collisions occur instantaneously and that collisions involving more than two particles simultaneously can be disregarded . moreover , all pairs are allowed to exchange impulse regardless of their mutual separation . in this sense",

    "as we have seen in the latter case the tails are originated by the presence of a singular point at the origin in the equation for the characteristic function @xcite .",
    "the singularity is due to the conspiracy of the constant cooling rate and of the scaling form of the evolution equation .",
    "such a singularity is removed in the driven case , thus high velocity tails cease to exist and the distribution will be much more well behaved .    the mathematical structure of eqs .",

    "of course the detailed form of the probability velocity distributions are strictly model dependent , i.e. depend on the assumption of a constant collision rate inherent in maxwell models .",
    "finally , the vectorial character of the velocities could be included at the cost of a moderate additional effort .",
    "a more interesting and difficult problem would be that of including in the mixture case a collision frequency proportional to an appropriate function of the kinetic granular temperatures , generalizing the work of cercignani @xcite .",
    "finally we might ask the general question of the meaning of granular temperature .",
    "our findings seem to indicate that it is still the main statistical indicator of the model granular system we studied . however , with respect to the temperature of a perfectly elastic system it fails to satisfy a very basic requirement which is known as the zeroth principle of thermodynamics .        in the present appendix we sketch the derivation of the various moments of the distribution functions . by equating the equal powers of @xmath51 in the master equation ( [ fou ] )",
    "we obtain a set linear of coupled equations for the moments .",
    "the method of solution is iterative , because the higher moments depend on the lower moments .",
    "thus , for instance , to evaluate the lowest order moments of the distribution functions we must solve the following equations for the steady state value of the fourth moments :                @xmath138 + ( 1-p)[\\tilde\\gamma_{12}]^n \\\\ d^{(n)}_{12 } & = ( 1-p)[(1-\\tilde\\gamma_{12})]^n \\\\ d^{(n)}_{22 } & = -1+(1-p)[\\gamma_{22}^n+(1-\\gamma_{22})^n ] + p[\\tilde\\gamma_{21}]^n \\\\ d^{(n)}_{21 } & = p [ ( 1-\\tilde\\gamma_{21})]^n\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      @xmath140 ^ 2 \\\\ a_{22}&=6 ( 1-p ) [ \\gamma_{22}(1-\\gamma_{22})]^2 \\\\ a_{12}&=6(1-p ) [ ( 1-\\tilde\\gamma_{12})]^2 [ \\tilde\\gamma_{12})]^2 \\\\ a_{21}&=6p [ ( 1-\\tilde\\gamma_{21})]^2 [ \\tilde\\gamma_{21})]^2 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      @xmath142 \\\\ b_{22}&=15 ( 1-p ) \\gamma_{22}^2(1-\\gamma_{22})^2 [ \\gamma_{22}^2+(1-\\gamma_{22})^2 ] \\\\",

    "<S> we investigate a maxwell model of inelastic granular mixture under the influence of a stochastic driving and obtain its steady state properties in the context of classical kinetic theory . </S>",
