    "the supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) represents a powerful tool for the spectral design in quantum theory . it has proved successful to construct solvable potentials for which the spectral information can be anallytically determined @xcite .",
    "the simplest version is the first - order susy qm which , however , does not allow to modify levels different from the ground state without creating singularities in the susy partner potential @xcite . as an alternative to surpass this problem ,",
    "the second - order susy qm can be used @xcite .",
    "indeed , through this technique one can embed two levels @xmath0 between two neighbouring energies of the initial hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "it is possible as well to create single levels above @xmath2 @xcite and to generate complex potentials with either purely real spectra or having some complex ` energies ' @xcite .    for @xmath3 the modification to the potential induced by the second - order susy qm involves the wronskian of the associated seed schrdinger solutions @xmath4 .",
    "in the confluent case @xmath5 , however , the key function @xmath6 inducing the change depends just of one seed solution @xmath7 and it is not clear that the treatment based on the wronskian remains valid . in this paper we will prove that result by identifying appropriate ( generalized ) eigenfunctions for which the wronskian coincides with @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that a unified technique valid in the non - confluent and in the confluent case is available , we just have to identify the right seed solutions .    in the next section",
    "we will address the second - order susy qm and its classification scheme .",
    "we will study in some detail the confluent case , the restrictions onto the seed solution to ensure the regularity of the potentials difference and the discussion about the wronskian .",
    "then , we will generate confluent second - order susy partners of the coulomb potential ( some of which are new ) .",
    "we will end the paper with our conclusions .",
    "the second - order susy qm consists in the following realization of the standard susy algebra with two generators : @xmath8 =   0 , \\quad j , k   =   1,2 \\\\ & & q_1 = \\frac{q^\\dagger + q}{\\sqrt{2 } } , \\quad q_2 = \\frac{q^\\dagger - q}{i\\sqrt{2 } } , \\quad q = \\left(\\begin{matrix } 0 & a \\cr 0 & 0 \\end{matrix}\\right ) , \\quad   q^\\dagger = \\left(\\begin{matrix } 0 & 0 \\cr a^\\dagger & 0 \\end{matrix}\\right)\\\\ & & h_{ss }   =   \\left(\\begin{matrix } a a^\\dagger & 0 \\cr 0 & a^\\dagger a \\end{matrix } \\right )   =   \\prod_{j=1}^2 \\left ( \\begin{matrix } \\widetilde h - \\epsilon_j & 0 \\cr 0 & h - \\epsilon_j \\end{matrix }",

    "let us use the anstz : @xmath15 which leads to @xmath16 and the following riccati equation : @xmath17 we can work instead with the equivalent schrdinger equation ( @xmath18 ) @xmath19 thus , the solutions @xmath14 can be classified according to the sign of @xmath11 .",
    "here @xmath21 , @xmath3 ; this includes the real case with @xmath22 and the complex one with @xmath23 . from ( [ ansatz ] )",
    "two equations for @xmath14 are obtained : @xmath24 which leads to : @xmath25   \\label{etanonconf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the wronskian of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "to avoid singularities in @xmath29 the wronskian has to be nodeless .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , will depend as well on the normalizability of the two eigenfunctions @xmath32 of @xmath30 with eigenvalue @xmath33 in the kernel of @xmath34 , with explicit expressions given by @xmath35 .",
    "some spectral design possibilities are worth to be mentioned ( for a detailed treatment see @xcite ) . _",
    "i ) _ two levels @xmath36 can be created _ below _ the ground state energy of @xmath37 , namely , @xmath38 , @xmath39 @xcite . _",
    "ii ) _ a pair of levels can be placed _ between _ two neighbouring energies of @xmath37 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "_ iii ) _ two neighbouring energies of @xmath37 can be _ deleted _ , namely , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 @xmath45 @xcite . _",
    "iv ) _ some _ complex _ energies can be manufactured ( the new hamiltonians are non - hermitian ) @xcite .",
    "cases _ ii ) , iii ) , iv ) _ run against the dominant idea that in susy qm the new levels are always real and _ below _ the ground state energy of the initial hamiltonian , improving thus our spectral design possibilities @xcite .",
    "we have now that @xmath47 , and the anstz ( [ ansatz ] ) just provides @xcite : @xmath48 this bernoulli equation has a general solution given by @xmath49 \\label{etaconf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , up to an unimportant constant factor , @xmath50 since equations ( [ etanonconf],[etaconf ] ) look similar , perhaps @xmath6 has to do with a wronskian . to see that",
    ", suppose there is a function @xmath51 related with the given @xmath7 through : @xmath52 i.e. , @xmath7 and @xmath51 are rank @xmath53 and rank @xmath54 generalized eigenfunctions of @xmath37 .",
    "this fact was noticed in @xcite , but a further study exploring the link with the wronskian formula is needed .",
    "let us find now @xmath51 from the differential equation ( [ jsdiff ] ) : @xmath55 up to a constant factor , it turns out that @xmath56 .",
    "similarly as for @xmath3 , the regular confluent transformation will be produced by a nodeless @xmath6 .",
    "if the domain of @xmath57 is @xmath58 , it is sufficient to use solutions @xmath59 vanishing either when @xmath60 or when @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "however , if the @xmath57-domain is the positive semi - axis , as in the coulomb problem which we will address later , the simplest choice is to take : @xmath62 for @xmath63 one of the requirements ( [ uvp ] ) can be achieved , but not both simultaneously .",
    "for @xmath64 the two conditons ( [ uvp ] ) are automatically satisfied . in both cases a normalized eigenfunction of @xmath30 with eigenvalue @xmath1 in the kernel of @xmath34 can be found , @xmath65 . in particular , for @xmath66 equation ( [ uvp ] ) can be fulfilled , i.e. , one level can be created above @xmath2 .",
    "let us remind that the excited state solutions obey ( [ uvp ] ) and thus they are appropriate to generate new potentials through the confluent susy algorithm .",
    "let us apply the confluent algorithm to the coulomb problem which , after separating the angular variables and taking @xmath67 , leads to a schrdinger hamiltonian as given in ( [ defhhtil ] ) , with an effective potential @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "the spectrum of the corresponding hamiltonian reads @xmath70 .",
    "first we find the general solution to ( [ schro ] ) with the @xmath71 of ( [ coulomb ] ) and an arbitrary factorization energy @xmath72 ; second , the solution with the right behaviour is chosen ( see eq .",

    "notice that @xmath76 becomes the normalized eigenfunction of @xmath37 for @xmath77 .",
    "a straightforward calculation leads now to our key @xmath78-function : @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 are the beta and a generalized hypergeometric function . for @xmath82 this",

    "the potentials ( [ nvl0n1 ] ) coincide with a family derived long ago through the factorization method , we just take @xmath99 in ( [ nvl0n1 ] ) to get equation ( 3.1 ) of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "contrasting with the first - order susy qm , in which we modify just the ground state energy , the confluent algorithm allows the embedding of levels at any positions on the energy axis .",
    "we have shown that the wronskian formula is still valid in the confluent case .",
    "we conclude that the second - order susy qm represents a poweful tool in which the right choice of the seed solutions allows us to generate the new potential in a simple way .",
