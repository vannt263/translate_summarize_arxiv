    "we consider bernoulli bond percolation on the square lattice at supercritical density , conditioned to have a large dual circuit enclosing the origin ; we denote the outermost such circuit by @xmath4 .",
    "( complete definitions and the basic properties of the model will be given in the next section . ) the supercritical , or percolating , regime of bernoulli percolation is the analog of the low - temperature phase of a spin system , and the region enclosed by the dual circuit is the analog of the droplet that occurs with high probability in the ising magnet below the critical temperature in a finite box with minus boundary condition , when it is conditioned to have a number of plus spins somewhat larger than is typical @xcite .",
    "in fact , the droplet boundary in the ising magnet appears as a circuit of open dual bonds in the corresponding fortuin - kastelyn random cluster model ( briefly , the fk model ) of @xcite , in view of the construction given in @xcite .",
    "one can gain information for the study of the ising droplet by studying the fk model conditioned on @xmath5 enclosing at least a given area @xmath6 , as is done in @xcite .",
    "the droplet boundary in this fk model thus corresponds to an interface ; the heuristics in the case of bernoulli percolation are the same , but the mathematics is more tractable .",
    "we therefore refer to @xmath4 and its interior as a droplet .",
    "our main result is a lower bound on the maximum local roughness of the droplet , that is , the maximum inward deviation of the boundary of the droplet from the boundary of its convex hull . related upper bounds were proved in @xcite .",
    "the study of the shapes of such droplets is related to a classical problem : when a fixed volume of one phase is immersed in another , what is the equilibrium shape of the droplet , or crystal , having minimal surface tension ? when the surface tension is known , this is an isoperimetric problem .",
    "the solution of the continuum version of the problem is given by wulff @xcite : let @xmath7 be the surface tension of a flat interface orthogonal to the outward normal @xmath8 . for a fixed crystal volume ,",
    "the equilibrium shape is given by the convex set @xmath9 in the two - dimensional ising model , say with minus boundary condition and conditioned to have an excess of pluses , a rigorous justification of the wulff construction has been given for the resulting droplet of plus phase .",
    "minlos and sinai considered an instance in which the temperature @xmath10 tends to zero as the volume grows to infinity , and proved that most of the excess plus spins form a single droplet of essentially square shape ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; the wulff shape @xmath11 also tends to a square as @xmath12 .",
    "dobrushin , kotecky and shlosman @xcite then provided a justification of the wulff construction at very low fixed temperatures .",
    "moreover , they showed that the hausdorff distance between the droplet boundary @xmath13 and the boundary of the wulff shape @xmath11 is bounded by a power of the linear scale of the droplet .",
    "this hausdorff distance is related but not equivalent to local roughness ; see @xcite .",
    "the very - low - temperature restriction was removed by ioffe and schonmann @xcite , who proved dobrushin - kotecky - schlosman theorem up to the critical temperature .",
    "for bernoulli percolation the wulff construction was justified in @xcite , and for the fk model this was done in @xcite . for these models",
    "the surface tension is given by the inverse of the exponential rate of decay of the dual connectivity .",
    "boundary roughness has been a topic of considerable interest in the physics literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the heuristics for the local roughness of @xmath4 , described in @xcite , are related to the boundary - roughness heuristics for two - dimensional growth models such as first - passage percolation that are believed to be governed by the `` kpz '' theory ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , to polymers in two - dimensional random environments @xcite , and , as noted in @xcite , to the heuristics of rigorously proved results on longest increasing subsequences of random permutations @xcite , which in turn are related to the fluctuations of eigenvalues of random matrices ( see @xcite ) . in all cases for an object of linear scale @xmath1 there is known or believed to be roughness of order @xmath14 and a longitudinal correlation length of order @xmath15 . in the percolation droplet this correlation length should appear as the typical separation between adjacent extreme points of the convex hull of @xmath4 .    in @xcite the _ average local roughness _ , denoted alr(@xmath16 , for the percolation droplet was defined as the area between the droplet and its convex hull boundary , divided by the euclidean length of the convex hull boundary .",
    "it was proved there that with high probability , for a droplet conditioned to have area at least @xmath0 , the alr(@xmath16 is @xmath17 .",
    "the main feature of interest is the exponent 1/3 matching the kpz heuristic ; the power of @xmath18 may be considered an artifact of the proof .",
    "here we consider not average but _ maximum local roughness _",
    ", denoted mlr(@xmath16 and defined as the maximum distance from any point of @xmath4 to the convex hull boundary , and we show that for the bernoulli percolation droplet , for some @xmath19 , with high probability it is at least @xmath20 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that with high probability mlr(@xmath16 is @xmath21 , but this is a presumably a very crude bound , lacking the right power of @xmath1 ; it is more reasonable to compare the lower bound here on mlr(@xmath16 to the upper bound for alr(@xmath16 , as the two should differ by at most a multiplicative factor that is a power of @xmath18 , as we explain next .",
    "one way to obtain more - detailed heuristics for the droplet boundary is to view it as having gaussian fluctuations about a fixed wulff shape of area @xmath0 , a point of view justified in part by the results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this point of view suggests that if we take a brownian bridge on [ 0,1 ] , rescale it by @xmath22 horizontally and @xmath23 vertically , and wrap it around a circle of radius @xmath1 , joining @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the result should resemble the droplet boundary . in @xcite",
    "it was proved that for this wrapped brownian bridge the maximum local roughness is with high probability bounded between @xmath26 and @xmath27 for some @xmath28 .",
    "the exponent 2/3 on @xmath18 here is related to the lvy modulus of continuity for brownian motion .",
    "the wrapped - brownian - bridge heuristic suggests that alr(@xmath16 should be of order @xmath14 , without a power of @xmath18 , supporting the idea that alr(@xmath16 and mlr(@xmath16 differ by only a multiplicative factor that is roughly a power of @xmath18 .",
    "the circle provides a reasonable heuristic here because ioffe and schonmann @xcite showed that for fixed @xmath29 the curvature of the boundary of the unit - area wulff shape is bounded away from 0 and @xmath30 .",

    "the basic idea is that mlr(@xmath88 implies that @xmath5 stays in a narrow tube along its own convex hull , which is a highly unlikely event , due to the gaussian fluctuations of connectivities .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath89 and @xmath90 are extreme points of @xmath91 separated by a distance of order @xmath92 , then mlr(@xmath93 requres that @xmath5 stay confined within @xmath94 of the straight line from @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "gaussian fluctuations , though , would say that the typical deviation from the straight line is of order @xmath95 , which is the square root of the length of the line .",
    "thus the confinement for the segment between @xmath89 and @xmath90 is analogous to keeping the maximum magnitude of a brownian bridge below @xmath96 , and such confinement along the entire boundary of @xmath4 is very unlikely .",
    "the brownian bridge analogy is an underlying heuristic but does not enter directly into our proofs .",
