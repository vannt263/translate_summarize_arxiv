    "the recent re - evaluation of the anti - neutrino fluxes emitted in nuclear power plants @xcite introduces some ambiguity in the results obtained for the mixing angle @xmath0 .",
    "since the new predictions are in slight disagreement with data from short - baseline ( sbl ) reactor experiments , with @xmath37  m , it becomes necessary to include these data in the fit .",
    "a flux - free analysis of sbl data prefers an off - set of the reactor neutrino flux of about 6% from the predicted value with a significance of about @xmath48 .",
    "taken at face value this might indicate either some un - accounted systematic effect ( either in the new calculations or in the reactor data ) , or even the presence of some kind of new physics such as sterile neutrino oscillations with @xmath76  ev@xmath52  @xcite . here",
    "we stick to the three - flavour framework , the sterile neutrino hypothesis will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .    despite this hint for a deviation of the observed reactor anti - neutrino flux from its prediction , the goodness - of - fit of the sbl reactor neutrino data with the new fluxes is still very good ( @xmath77 for 12 degrees of freedom ) . motivated by this result , we adopt as our recommended default analysis the new fluxes and include the sbl data in the fit .",
    "in such a way we obtain a hint for @xmath31 at @xmath67 , coming from a preference for a finite @xmath0 from kamland data combined with a somewhat weaker hint from the joint analysis of atmospheric + minos data . in table  [ tab : sq13 ] we show in detail how the global result depends on the assumptions on the reactor neutrino analysis , yielding hints for @xmath31 ranging between 1.4@xmath1 and 2.8@xmath1 , with best fit values between @xmath78 and @xmath79 . this somewhat ambiguous situation regarding",
    "@xmath0 emerges from the slight tension due to the new reactor flux predictions with data",
