    "<S> , we deal with targeting a bell state and a spin helix state .        </S>",
    "<S> preparation of entangled states is a core problem in most protocols of quantum information science and its technological applications . </S>",
    "<S> target quantum states can be generated , in principle , in various ways : via coherent dynamics , dissipative dynamics , or a generic mixed coherent and dissipative dynamics  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the mixed generation of pure states , which best mimics the typical experimental conditions , has the advantage of being stable against decoherence and almost independent of the initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> both these features are due to the existence of a nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) , assumed to be unique , of the lindblad master equation which describes the mixed coherent and dissipative dynamics of the system . </S>",
    "<S> apart from limitations due to imperfections of experimental setups , an _ ideal target _ might be unreachable because of fundamental limitations . </S>",
    "<S> an optimization problem then arises , namely , how to approach the target maximally closely with the available resources .    in the present context , </S>",
    "<S> the ideal target is to generate a chosen pure ness dissipatively , and the available resources are : dissipative actions , accessible ranges of respective dissipative strengths , and accessible coherent evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> it is known  @xcite that an exact pure ness requires a _ commuting _ action of coherent and dissipative parts of the dynamics on the target state . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the target state @xmath0 must satisfy @xmath1 where the effective hamiltonian @xmath2 and lindblad operators @xmath3 describe the evolution of the reduced density matrix as in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lme ] ) . often , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ yamamoto1]-[yamamoto2 ] ) can not be simultaneously satisfied , making the ideal target unreachable .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose , however , that one can still satisfy , or approximately satisfy , some of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ yamamoto1]-[yamamoto2 ] ) . which conditions are crucial and which can be relaxed without ruining the ness ? </S>",
    "<S> a universal answer to this question does not exist , as it would require a perturbative analysis of a concrete liouvillean operator .    </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to demonstrate that one can generate an almost pure ness by a much weaker criterion than the `` commutativity on the state '' , at a low additional cost , namely , the ability to increase the strength of dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> this strength can usually be manipulated in experiments , e.g. , a dissipative loss rate of atoms in an optical trap is controlled by a laser beam intensity . </S>",
    "<S> even the zeno limit can be routinely reached experimentally  @xcite , and it often produces surprising effects  @xcite .    according to our weaker criterion , coherent and dissipative actions on a target state need not be commutative . </S>",
    "<S> violation of the `` commutativity on the state '' forbids , in a strict mathematical sense , to generate an exact pure ness . instead , a state , which is arbitrarily close to the exact one , up to a controlled error , can be dissipatively generated . </S>",
    "<S> our criterion thus naturally consists of two parts , given by following theorems  [ theorem1 ] and [ theorem2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> theorem  [ theorem1 ] gives the weaker criterion valid for _ strong _ dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> theorem [ theorem2 ] quantifies how strong the dissipation should be in order to generate an almost pure ness , and imposes further ( exceptional ) restrictions on the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> these restrictions concern isolated points where the weak criterium alone fails or might fail . </S>",
    "<S> thus , theorems [ theorem1 ] and [ theorem2 ] provide , respectively , necessary and sufficient conditions for generating a pure ness in the zeno limit .    </S>",
    "<S> after formulating theorems [ theorem1 ] and [ theorem2 ] , we discuss two examples : the generation of a bell state in a system of three interacting qubits , see fig .  [ bellstate_targeting ] , and the generation of a spin - helix state in a boundary driven spin chain with nearest - neighbour interaction , see fig .  [ spinhelixstate_targeting ] . in the first example </S>",
    "<S> , we illustrate the presence of exceptional points . with the second example </S>",
