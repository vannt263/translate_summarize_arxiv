    "secular perturbation theory gives an evolution equation for the complex eccentricity @xmath15 of planetesimals in the gas - free case @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the secular timescale and @xmath18 is the complex forcing , with @xmath19 the longitude of periastron of the binary orbit and @xmath20 the forced eccentricity @xcite .",
    "the secular timescale is given by @xcite : @xmath21 equation ( [ eqecc ] ) describes an oscillation around the forced eccentricity with an amplitude given by @xmath22 .",

    "even if orbital crossings can be prevented , the size - dependence of equilibrium orbits leads to high encounter velocities between bodies of different size .",

    "secular perturbation theory is valid on timescales longer than both the binary period and the local orbital timescale .",
    "in addition , planetesimal eccentricities evolve on a shorter timescale , even in the case @xmath25 , where secular effects are absent @xcite .",
    "this short timescale evolution can be obtained by averaging the disturbing function over the mean longitude of the binary orbit only , and expanding terms up to second order in both @xmath4 and planetesimal eccentricity @xmath26 .",
    "the eccentricity can then be shown to oscillate , on a local orbital timescale , around an eccentricity @xmath27 where the subscript ff indicates a fast timescale .",

    "almost equal mass binaries ( like kepler 34 and 35 ) , @xmath29 will be very small , while @xmath28 can be significant .",
    "since @xmath26 now evolves on a local dynamical timescale , orbital crossings will occur after only a few local orbits .",
    "gas drag is unable to damp these fast oscillations , because it acts on longer timescales than a dynamical timescale for km - sized objects and realistic gas densities .",
    "orbit crossings can not be prevented .",
    "typical encounter velocities will be @xmath30 ( @xmath31 in kepler 16 , and @xmath32 in kepler 34 and 35 at the locations of the planets ) . despite the lack of secular forcing ,",
    "this makes the systems kepler 34 and 35 hostile to accretion at the current planet positions . for kepler 16 , encounter velocities around @xmath31 can lead to accretion only when planetesimals have reached sizes of @xmath33 or larger @xcite . at twice the current semi - major axis of kepler 16b ,",
    "encounter velocities go down a factor of 4 , making accretion possible at that location if planetesimals can somehow grow to @xmath34 ( also seen by * ? ? ?",
    "in our simulations we consider a system of two stars with a coplanar circumbinary disk .",
    "the gas component of the disk is assumed to be circular and orbiting the binary centre of mass .",
    "the solid component of the disk consists of planetesimals @xmath35 km , which we model as particles , and small dust , on the same orbits as the gas .",
    "planetesimals can form from small dust , accrete small dust on their surface , and be returned to dust in catastrophic collisions .",
    "below , we explain the planetesimal evolution model in more detail .      as in @xcite , we restrict ourselves to planetesimal orbits lying in the orbital plane of the binary .",
    "preliminary calculations allowing for inclination of planetesimal orbits show no qualitative differences .",
    "in addition , allowing for three - dimensional ( 3d ) motions requires an impractical increase in cpu time .",
    "moreover , we expect collision velocities induced by fast or secular forced eccentricities to be much higher than the escape velocity from the surface of the planetesimal ( catastrophic collisions ) , which , as we explain below , makes the motions essentially two - dimensional ( 2d )",
    ". however , confining all orbits to a single plane will underestimate the true 3d collision timescale @xcite , strongly affecting the evolution of the system , which is sensitive to the balance between dynamical and collisional effects . in a strongly perturbed system , where almost every collision is destructive",
    ", it is difficult to estimate the 3d collision timescale since it is unclear what the inclination distribution of the fragments will be . for catastrophic collisions",
    ", @xcite showed that the maximum velocities obtained by the largest fragments are comparable to the escape speed of the combined projectile - target mass .",
    "therefore , in the regime of high - speed collisions expected in a close binary system the planetesimal disk is expected to stay approximately as thin as in the unperturbed case ( assuming the largest collision remnants trace the majority of the mass ) .",
    "thus , the thickness of the disk is set by the escape velocity of the planetesimals . in 2d",
    ", we can vary the collision timescale by changing the total mass in solids ( results do not depend sensitively on this mass ) .",
    "note that the thin disk approximation does not necessarily apply to the small debris . if the dust disk thickens because of collisions both dust accretion and planetesimal formation will be effected .",
    "planetesimal dynamics in binary systems is strongly affected by the timescale on which planetesimals are formed .",
    "if planetesimals form fast compared to the timescale of eccentricity forcing , and in a single burst , the interaction with the binary stars will keep their orbits in phase and collision velocities low @xcite .",
    "however , size - dependent gas drag introduces _ differential _",
    "orbital phasing , which leads to high collision velocities between bodies of different size , making planetesimal accretion difficult @xcite .",
    "eccentricity forcing towards @xmath28 occurs on a dynamical timescale . on such short timescales",
    "orbital crossings can not be prevented by gas drag .",
    "in addition , if planetesimals form continuously , their orbits will be out of phase from the start .",
    "the local collision velocity is estimated as , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a typical eccentricity .",
    "a reasonable timescale for the formation of an individual planetesimal is @xmath38 years @xcite .",
    "this places a lower limit on the timescale for dust to be converted into planetesimals .",
    "@xcite found that the latter timescale could vary by several orders of magnitude depending on the local conditions in the disk . in the simulations presented here , as in @xcite ,",
    "planetesimals form continuously with half of the total ( local ) dust mass converted into planetesimals in @xmath39 local orbits .",
    "planetesimals that wander off the computational domain are added to the innermost or outermost dust bin , thereby allowing them to be recycled .      in previous , purely dynamical codes , planetesimals eventually reached steady - state orbits imposed by gravitational perturbations and gas drag ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the work presented here",
    "this is not necessarily the case , because collisions can affect the size of planetesimals on their way to their steady - state orbits .",
    "if we assume that the thickness of the planetesimal disk is not strongly affected by high - speed collisions ( sec .",
    "[ sec2d ] ) and a typical collision speed @xmath40 , we can estimate the collision timescale in a 3d disk . consider a population of planetesimals of size @xmath41 , mass @xmath42 , and number density @xmath43 .",
    "the collision timescale is : @xmath44 where we have used @xmath45 , with @xmath46 the surface density of planetesimals and a thickness @xmath47 set by the escape velocity , @xmath48 .",
    "a similar expression can be derived in the 2d approximation , yielding a ratio : @xmath49 which depends only on @xmath8 . to get realistic collision timescales in our 2d approximation",
    ", we can tune the @xmath50 value to @xmath51 by artificially reducing the disk mass by a factor 2000 .",
    "this setting is , to first order , an acceptable one because we have found that the qualitative outcome of the simulations does not depend sensitively on the disk mass .",
    "having chosen a disk mass , we want to represent this mass as accurately as possible .",
    "we can not track all individual bodies of km - size since their number can exceed @xmath52 .",
    "instead , we inflated the radius of each particle ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we found that taking an inflated radius for a 1 km planetesimal , @xmath53 , gave satisfying collision statistics without introducing a bias in encounter velocities .",
    "collision outcomes are determined based on the velocity - dependent catastrophic disruption criteria of @xcite ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the gas disk is assumed to be static with no pressure gradient so that there is no radial drift for solids that are coupled to the gas through aerodynamic drag .",
    "while radial drift could be easily incorporated for the planetesimals it will be more important for the small dust component , especially for mass that is in m - sized bodies . since we have no information about the size distribution of bodies @xmath54 km , we choose to neglect radial drift . for simplicity , the dust surface density is @xmath55 , so that the mass inside a ring of radial thickness @xmath56 is constant throughout the disk .",
    "experiments with different density profiles showed no qualitative differences in the outcome of the simulations .",
    "radial migration of planetesimals therefore does not play a major role in our simulations .",
    "this may not be true for the small dust component , whose radial drift will be strongly affected by pressure structure in the disk .",
    "if most collisions between planetesimals are destructive , a large fraction of the solid component of the disk will be in small debris , which can be picked up by remaining planetesimals .",
    "this process involves an efficiency factor @xmath57 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we take a computational domain for the planetesimal disk @xmath66 , with a total solid mass of @xmath67 @xmath68 , where @xmath68 is the mass of a 1 km planetesimal , and a surface density @xmath55 . initially , all the mass is in small dust .",

    ", @xmath29 dominates over @xmath28 throughout the disk .",
    "while gas drag acts to slowly force planetesimals onto equilibrium orbits , the continuous introduction of new planetesimals with @xmath71 and the collisional destruction of older planetesimals lead to orbits that are unphased .",
    "collisions between planetesimals on unphased orbits would occur at @xmath72 .",

    "we now turn on dust accretion in full , which is the most favourable case possible for accretion .",
    "dust accretion is quenched for relative velocities exceeding @xmath76 .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_ae ] shows that in this case it is possible to grow planetesimals further in .",

    "[ fig_ae ] ) . in regions where accretion is possible , @xmath77 ,",
    "all the mass ends up in planetesimals , and the maximum planetesimal size that can be reached is only limited by the amount of mass available .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_mass ] , which shows that while for @xmath58 less than 1% of the total mass ends up in planetesimals , for @xmath59 essentially all the mass inside @xmath78 resides in planetesimals .",
    "after @xmath79 binary orbits , the region @xmath80 has not evolved to the planetesimal - only state yet .",
    "figure [ fig_mass ] also shows another important effect , namely mass transport towards accretion - friendly regions .",
    "the region inside @xmath81 is depleted , not only in planetesimals because of destructive collisions , but also of small dust .",
    "this can happen because planetesimals are not necessarily formed and destroyed at the same radius .",
    "if a planetesimal is born at radius @xmath63 with @xmath71 and its eccentricity is excited to @xmath82 its orbit lies between @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the planetesimal can be destroyed at any radius between these extremes . at the inner edge of the accretion - friendly region",
    ", mass gets locked up in large , indestructible planetesimals .",
    "outward mass transport into the accretion - friendly region is therefore a one - way street , which eventually leads to the depletion of the inner disk .",
    "this process competes against inward radial dust drift , which we neglect here .",
    "we now briefly discuss the systems kepler 34 and kepler 35 .",
    "these are both almost equal - mass binaries ( see table [ tab1 ] ) , which makes @xmath29 small .",
    "planetesimal orbital evolution is predominantly due to short timescale interactions with the binary , whose amplitude falls off rapidly with distance , since @xmath85 .",
    "this makes these systems slightly more accretion friendly than kepler 16 at small radii . in the case of no dust accretion , we find that planetesimal growth is possible for @xmath86 for kepler 34 and for @xmath87 for kepler 35 .",
    "full dust accretion leads to very similar results : planetesimal accretion is possible slightly further in compared to kepler 16 .",
    "however , in situ accretion starting from 1 km planetesimals is still not possible .",
    "we have studied planetesimal collisions in circumbinary gas disks , focusing on the planet - harbouring systems kepler 16 , 34 and 35 .",
    "we have shown that in addition to secular forcing , planetesimals experience eccentricity forcing on a dynamical timescale , which leads to eccentricity oscillations and orbital crossings that can not be prevented by gas drag .",
    "this makes the current location of the planets kepler 16b , 34b and 35b very hostile for planetesimal accretion .",
    "we then used a numerical model similar to that of @xcite including planetesimal formation and accretion of small dust . even in the most favourable case of 100% efficient dust accretion",
    ", we have been unable to grow planetesimals from initially 1 km at the current location of the planets . since",
    "dust accretion is likely to be less than 100% efficient , for example because not all the small dust will be concentrated in the midplane of the disk , we conclude that in situ planetesimal accretion is difficult for the planets kepler 16b , 34b and 35b .",
    "we have made several necessary simplifications to make following the collisional evolution of the planetesimal population tractable .",
    "first of all , we have ignored gas dynamics throughout and worked with a static circular gas disk . while the gas disk is likely to become eccentric , especially at small radii , it was shown in @xcite that unless the gas relaxes towards the forced eccentricity , including gas dynamics makes matters worse for planetesimal accretion .",
    "for the fast eccentricity oscillations to be damped by gas drag , the gas disk will have to oscillate in phase with the planetesimals .",
    "full hydrodynamical simulations are necessary to determine whether this is the case .",
    "these can also be used to study the effect of the inner truncation of the gas disk , and we will consider such simulations in future investigations .",
    "we considered the planar case , but a small inclination of the binary plane with respect to the gas disk may promote planetesimal accretion in the circumprimary case @xcite .",
    "however , because of the fast eccentricity oscillations and the resulting orbital crossings it is unclear if this effect can play a role in the circumbinary case .",
    "moreover , it was shown in @xcite that including gas dynamics again makes matters worse , even in the misaligned disk case .",
    "a formation mechanism which can leapfrog the problematic km - size range , such as gravitational collapse aided by streaming instabilities @xcite , may overcome the problems of planetesimal accretion .",
    "it remains to be seen , however , if such a mechanism can operate in close binary systems .",
    "preliminary calculations show that in the current model , we would need to start with planetesimals of at least @xmath88 in order for in situ accretion of the kepler circumbinary planets to become possible .",
    "the most straightforward solution is that the three circumbinary planets were assembled further out in an accretion - friendly region , and migrated in towards their current location at a later stage .",
    "this can be achieved at a relatively early stage , in the 10 - 100 km size range , by radial drift due to a pressure gradient in the gas , or at a later stage when the planet is more or less fully grown , by type i or type ii planetary migration .",
    "whatever the migration mechanism , it is likely that the inner edge of the truncated gas disk will cause migration to stall .",
    "we then expect the current location of the planets to be close to the truncation radius of the gas disk ."
