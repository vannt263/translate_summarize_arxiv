    "theoretically , the cdw magnetic properties are believed to be trivial : due to the gap in the electron spectrum , at temperatures significantly below @xmath2 electronic contribution to the susceptibility vanishes .",
    "how localized magnetic moments can emerge under such circumstances ?    in this paper",
    "we propose a mechanism , which may explain the origin of these magnetic moments .",

    "strongly distorts the cdw to choose a particular value of @xmath17 , which minimizes the pinning energy function .",
    "in such a regime the assumption of homogeneous distribution of @xmath17 is , clearly , invalid . instead",
    ", a distribution function would concentrate around a particular value ( or values ) of @xmath17 .",
    "this , however , does not affect the major conclusions of our study . specifically ,",
    "both the divergence of the susceptibility and the low field maximum of the heat capacity are consequences of the impurities hosting spins .",
    "to generate at least some amount of the spinful impurities the ensemble we have introduced in subsection  [ tls::susceptibility_ensemble ] requires arbitrary weak @xmath25 . for different distribution",
    "function it may be necessary for @xmath25 to exceed some critical strength @xmath171 . if @xmath172 , then both divergent susceptibility and non - monotonous field - dependent heat capacity should be expected .",
    "a possible theoretical mechanism explaining generation of the magnetic moments in cdw state has been proposed in ref .   by vakhitov and co - authors . in that reference a strongly anisotropic quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) metal interacting with phonon mode has been studied .",
    "the metal undergoes the peierls transition at some finite temperature .",
    "it was demonstrated that , under suitable conditions , an impurity introduced into such a system traps an unpaired electron .",
    "these impurities , randomly scattered over the sample , are responsible for the low - temperature susceptibility enhancement .    while several basic ingredients of the model of ref .",
    "are similar to the assumptions of the present paper , there is an important distinction : the proposal of ref",
    ".   relies heavily on the bosonization of one - dimensional electrons .",
    "as such , it can be applied to study of q1d systems , like o - tas@xmath1 and blue bronze rb@xmath173moo@xmath1 . however , non - magnetic tritellurides late@xmath1 and yte@xmath1 are quasi - two - dimensional .",
    "thus , it appears important to develop an alternative mechanism , operational beyond q1d realm .",
    "our formalism relies not on the bosonization , but rather on the mean field theory for the frlich hamiltonian .",
    "the mean field approach may be used for quasi - two - dimensional , three - dimensional and , with certain care  @xcite , even for q1d systems .",
    "consequently , our mechanism has a much wider applicability range .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a possible mechanism responsible for the generation of the localized magnetic moments in a material with cdw .",
    "its main idea is quite generic : for an anderson impurity in an insulating environment one can always find a parameter range where the impurity hosts a single electron spin .",
    "using the perturbation theory in the impurity interaction strength @xmath25 , we mapped the zero - temperature phase diagram of a single impurity .",
    "it consists of magnetic and non - magnetic phases .",
    "the presence of the magnetic phase can affect the thermodynamic properties of a diluted ensemble of such impurities .",
    "it was determined that the ensemble s susceptibility diverges at low temperature , and the heat capacity demonstrates marked dependence on weak magnetic field .",
    "both theoretical findings are consistent with the experimental observations in some cdw materials .",
    "the mechanism is fairly robust in the sense that the nature of the impurity and some other details are not very important .",
    "while our hamiltonian described a point - like impurity , an extended shallow level bound to a defect may be considered instead . at the same time , the mechanism is not universal : if the ensemble parameters lie outside the relevant region , no localized magnetic moments appear , and the material has trivial magnetic properties .",
