    "a prime motivation of these studies has been to investigate the nature of the faint field population . in particular , it is possible to infer the effective correlation length of the sample and the rate at which clustering evolves from a combination of the amplitude of the angular autocorrelation function , @xmath6 , and the redshift distribution of the faint galaxies , @xmath11 .",
    "these observations can then be used to link properties of the faint field population with samples of local galaxies .",
    "while the exact interpretation remains controversial , it is generally accepted that overall @xmath6 is fit well by a power law of the form @xmath12 ( although see infante & pritchet ( 1995 ) for evidence of a flattening in the power - law coefficient at faint limits ) .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of @xmath6 appears to decline strongly with apparent magnitude , although it remains significantly non - zero at the faintest limits .",
    "some knowledge of the redshift distribution of the galaxies is required in order to interpret the observed decline of the amplitude of @xmath6 with limiting magnitude in terms of the evolution of real - space clustering .",
    "although their precise @xmath11 is not known , the majority of the faint field population to depths of @xmath0 appear to have @xmath13 ( kneib et al .",
    "1996 ; connolly et al .",
    "1997 ) . given this constraint ,",
    "the rate of clustering evolution inferred from @xmath6 is consistent with all `` reasonable '' theoretical possibilities .",
    "similarly , the present - day correlation length of the descendents of the faint galaxy population is not constrained strongly .",
    "some authors argue in favor of a value of @xmath14 close to that of local bright galaxies ( hudon & lilly 1995 ; villumsen , freudling & da costa 1996 ) , while others argue for a smaller value , consistent with that seen for dwarf galaxies ( bsm ; infante & pritchet 1995 ) .",
    "a feature which has emerged from the studies of @xmath6 for faint galaxies in blue passbands is a slowing of the decline of the correlation amplitude with apparent magnitude beyond @xmath1525 , equivalent to a median @xmath2 magnitude of @xmath16 ( roche et al .",
    "a change in the slope of the differential number counts is also seen in blue passbands at a similar magnitude ( metcalfe et al .",

    "clearly it is important to confirm and extend these observations to test this proposal .    here",
    "we present an analysis of @xmath6 obtained from deep imaging ( @xmath17 ) , sufficient to probe the strength and evolution of galaxy clustering from @xmath18 . by combining these observations with results from clustering analyses of other , brighter , @xmath2-selected samples we investigate the variation of @xmath6 with magnitude . using a modest extrapolation of the observed magnitude - redshift relation of",

    "results for @xmath67 as a function of median @xmath2-magnitude are plotted in fig .  2 , along with those from other studies of the clustering of @xmath2-selected galaxy samples .",
    "we start by noting that the clustering amplitudes of the brightest samples in both our fields are in reasonable agreement with the clustering of @xmath69 galaxies reported by ebktg who find @xmath70 ( corrected for their ic , but not stellar contamination ) . allowing a mean stellar contamination of order 5% in the ebktg data increases their value to @xmath71 ( fig .  2 ) .    performing a weighted linear least squares fit to the data of lidman & peterson ( 1996 ) shown in fig .  2",

    "moreover , for @xmath73 , @xmath67 appears to be nearly independent of magnitude , both internally within our sample and in comparison to slightly brighter studies .",
    "thus we conclude that the amplitude of @xmath6 for @xmath2-selected samples of galaxies ceases to decline steeply with apparent magnitude at @xmath74 and remains roughly constant at fainter magnitudes , although a modest rise or fall in the amplitude at the faintest magnitudes can not be ruled out .",
    "we construct a simple theoretical model to predict the angular clustering in our samples and compare this to the observations . on small scales ( @xmath75 rad . ) an angular correlation function of the form @xmath53 corresponds to a spatial correlation function of the form @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",

    "in contrast to the marked flattening suggested by the data , beyond @xmath107 the predicted amplitude of @xmath67 decreases roughly linearly .",
    "similar results are obtained for the open model and for @xmath108 and 1.0 .    due to the reduction of the proper volume element at high redshifts",
    ", the amplitude of @xmath6 is expected to become nearly - independent of magnitude when a high proportion of the galaxies in the sample are at @xmath8 .",
    "given that the shape of the expected variation of @xmath106 $ ] with median magnitude is most strongly dependent upon @xmath11 and , in particular , upon the tail of the distribution at large redshift , we modify our fiducial @xmath11 slightly in order to attempt to reproduce the general trend of flattening of the observed correlation amplitude at faint magnitudes . given the observational uncertainties in the determination of the amplitude we do not attempt to constrain @xmath11 in a robust manner ; rather , we simply address the question of what fraction of the faint field population must be at high-@xmath94 to allow @xmath67 to be nearly - independent of @xmath93 for @xmath109 .",
    "the modification consists of an extended tail of galaxies at @xmath1102 , which shifts the median redshifts of our samples to @xmath111 for @xmath112 . at @xmath113",

    "all data points have been corrected for the ic and stellar contamination .",
    "the thick solid line is a weighted linear least squares fit to the data of lidman & peterson ( 1996 ) .",
    "note that systematic offsets can be introduced into the measured values of @xmath67 by a number of effects , including atmospheric seeing differences between datasets , object deblending algorithms , the definition of mask regions , and stellar contamination corrections .",
    "such offsets would typically be comparable in magnitude to the size of the error bars at the faintest limits .",
    "also shown is the expected behavior of @xmath67 as a function of @xmath101 for a number of theoretical models in an eds universe .",
    "all theoretical predictions have been normalized to reproduce the observed clustering amplitude at @xmath119 .",
    "the thin solid line shows the theoretical prediction assuming @xmath122 and a faint galaxy redshift distribution extrapolated from the cfrs galaxies ( see text ) .",
    "the dashed , dotted , and dot  dash lines show the theoretical variation of @xmath67 with @xmath101 for @xmath84 , 0.0 , and 1.0 using a faint galaxy redshift distribution that incorporates a somewhat longer high@xmath94 tail than the simple extrapolation of the cfrs @xmath11 .",
    "the interpretation of the observed amplitude of @xmath6 in terms of a correlation length of the galaxy sample is complicated by both a lack of direct knowledge of the redshift distribution of these galaxies and the fact that at different limiting magnitudes the sample may be dominated by different galaxy populations .",
    "it is entirely likely that the morphological composition of a sample will vary with depth due to both the shift of the restframe wavelengths sampled by the filter and the possibility that different galaxy populations may evolve differently .",
    "this may contribute to the different conclusions drawn from clustering studies of faint galaxies in different passbands .",
    "at best all that can be concluded based on @xmath6 analyses of deep fields is an effective correlation length and and an effective rate of clustering evolution since it is clear that the observed clustering is inextricably linked to the evolution of the galaxy population as a whole .",
    "moreover , where fields are specifically chosen to avoid bright foreground galaxies ( bsm ) the inferred @xmath14 may be far lower than the true `` universal '' value since these lines of sight may be biased toward regions of the sky containing voids and , hence , would have an uncharacteristically low galaxy clustering amplitude .",
    "deep wide - field imaging ( sufficient to average over significant amounts of large - scale structure ) is therefore necessary to determine the mean amplitude of @xmath6 accurately at very faint magnitudes and , hence , provide strong conclusions about the clustering properties of the faint field population and the reality of any features in the relationship of @xmath6 and @xmath101 .",
    "here we have measured @xmath6 for faint galaxies in two independent random fields to @xmath0 using high resolution imaging obtained with the keck ",
    "i telescope .",
    "the angular clustering of the galaxies is consistent @xmath43 , though power laws which are either somewhat steeper or somewhat shallower can not be ruled out with high confidence .",
    "additionally , the observed clustering amplitude at our faint limit is consistent with that expected from local bright galaxies , @xmath1236@xmath124mpc , provided clustering evolves in a reasonable manner and the redshift distribution extends beyond @xmath125 .",
    "this conclusion echos that of woods & fahlman ( 1997 ) from their analysis of an @xmath126 sample .",
    "fainter than @xmath74 the amplitude of @xmath6 is approximately independent of median magnitude .",
    "this result supports claims of a flattening in the amplitude of @xmath6 obtained in blue samples at a comparable depth ( roche et al .",
    "the apparent abruptness of the flattening of the amplitude of @xmath67 is not reproduced well by a model based upon a simple extrapolation of the @xmath11 observed for the cfrs galaxies .",
    "we interpret this as evidence for a modest increase in the fraction of the galaxies at this depth lying in a high@xmath94 tail compared to the extrapolation of the cfrs @xmath11 . such a population has also been used to explain the flattening of the differential number counts in the blue passbands at a depth equivalent to @xmath127 ( metcalfe et al .",
    "1995 ; smail et al .",
    "the appearance of this feature at the equivalent apparent magnitude in both blue and red passbands rules out the possibility that it is caused by a population of very distant galaxies , @xmath128 , which fall out of the sample as the lyman - limit moves into the @xmath129-band .",
