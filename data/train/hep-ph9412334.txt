    "according to the nave constituent quark model , the proton wave function contains just two u - quarks and one d - quark . this model gives a good general picture of hadron structure at large distances , but probes of shorter distances and larger momentum transfers reveal more constituents , including a sea of qq ( q = u , d , s ) pairs and gluons .",
    "these evolve with momentum , in agreement with perturbative qcd , but there are indications that the nucleon wave function contains some ss pairs already at large distances or small momentum transfers , in the non - perturbative regime ( for reviews , see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "this should not be unexpected , since non - perturbative qcd effects cause ss pairs to be present in the vacuum : @xmath11 , and soluble two - dimensional models @xcite also predict the existence of non - perturbative ss pairs in the nucleon wave function .",
    "this possibility is also consistent with analytical @xcite and lattice @xcite determinations of the @xmath12 @xmath13 term .",
    "interesting experimental evidence for such an ss component comes from the apparent violation of the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule in the production of @xmath1 mesons in different reactions . according to the ozi rule @xcite",
    ", diagrams with disconnected quark lines should be negligible .",
    "production of the @xmath1 meson is a particularly sensitive probe of the ozi rule because the @xmath1 is almost a pure ss state , containing just a small admixture of u+dd associated with a small deviation @xmath14 from the ideal mixing angle @xmath15 .",
    "the ozi rule was used @xcite to predict @xmath16 for any initial - state hadrons a , b and final - state hadrons not containing strange quarks , where @xmath17 is a kinematical phase space factor . using the theoretically - favoured quadratic gell - mann - okubo mass formula",
    ", one finds @xmath18 and hence @xmath19 . as we see in table 1",
    ", many past experiments found an apparent excess of r above this ozi prediction , though this was not very dramatic : @xmath20 .",
    "the significance of such an excess can be inferred from the parameter @xmath21/\\sqrt{2 } } \\label{z}\\ ] ] which measures ozi - breaking in the amplitudes @xmath22 , leading to the estimate @xmath23 values of @xmath24 are also shown in table 1 , where we see that previous experiments indicate @xmath25 . however , as we discuss later in this paper , much larger apparent violations of the ozi rule , @xmath26 , have recently been found in pp annihilation at the low energy antiproton ring ( lear ) at cern , as reviewed in table 2 .",
    "0.3 cm    the main purpose of this paper is to pursue the interpretation of these data in terms of the  shake - out \" and  rearrangement \" of an intrinsic ss component of the nucleon wave function as illustrated in figs.1a , b , respectively .",
    "these mechanisms provide _ a channel - dependent , non - universal modification _ of the nave ozi prediction ( [ r ] ) , and we propose tests of our interpretation .",
    "this should not be considered a violation of the ozi rule , because it does not involve disconnected quark diagrams , but rather connected diagrams involving higher fock ",
    "space components in the nucleon wave function . within this approach ,",
    "we interpret the strong excess of @xmath1 production in s - wave pp annihilations in terms of the negative polarization of the nucleon s ss component indicated by emc and subsequent results @xcite .",
    "this interpretation could be tested by measurements of the @xmath2 production ratio in p - wave annihilations , where there may be an enhancement over the nave ozi expectations , and by experiments with polarized beams and polarized targets .",
    "we also mention a possible test of @xmath1 production within the intrinsic strangeness hypothesis in high - momentum transfer processes , via a difference in constituent counting rules from gluon - mediated production .",
    "we start with some general considerations on @xmath1 production via an intrinsic strangeness component of the nucleon .",
    "we adopt the following notation for the decomposition of the proton wave function : @xmath27 where @xmath28 stands for any number of gluons and light qq pairs , and the condition @xmath29 holds if we neglect the admixture of more than one @xmath30 pair .",
    "we consider two processes which are allowed by the ozi rule if such an intrinsic strangeness component is present , namely the  shake  out \" illustrated in fig.1a and the  rearrangement \" illustrated in fig.1b .",
    "a  shake  out \" amplitude for @xmath0 annihilation into a state with either hidden strangeness such as the @xmath1 or open strangeness , is given generically by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a projection factor which depends in particular on the final state considered : @xmath1 , @xmath33 , non ",
    "resonant @xmath34 pair , etc .",
    ", though there may also be some dependence on the initial @xmath0 state considered .",
    "rearrangement \" amplitude for producing a particular @xmath35  state is given generically by @xmath36 where the factor @xmath37 will in general depend quite strongly on both the initial and final spin states , since the @xmath38 and @xmath39 come from different initial  state particles .",
    "for example , this mechanism may be expected to be unlikely to give a p  wave strangeonium state such as the @xmath33 if the @xmath0 annihilation takes place from an s  wave state .",
    "the corresponding amplitudes for producing a light qq state with the same quantum numbers are not directly related to ( [ sh ] ) and ( [ re ] ) , but would be given generically by @xmath40,\\ ] ] in analogous notation .",
    "0.3 cm    defining z as in equation ( [ z ] ) , and assuming that the factors @xmath41 , @xmath42 are similar for light and strange quarks , we find @xmath43 for the  shake  out \" diagram and @xmath44 for the  rearrangement \" one . in particular , the linear dependence ( [ sha ] ) for shake - out processes allows @xmath45 to be relatively large , even if @xmath46 is small . if we choose even one of the most striking values in table 2 , namely @xmath47 , we see from ( [ sha])-([rea ] ) that the ss admixture needed in the proton wave function is in the range @xmath48 such an admixture is not incompatible with data on open strangeness production in pp annihilation at rest , as we now discuss .    our hypothesis that there are ss pairs  stored \" in nucleons , that can be  shaken out \" or  rearranged \" in pp annihilation , can be confronted with the available data on strange particle production in annihilation at rest . summing all measured channels containing kaons and correcting for unseen modes ,",
    "the kaon yield is found to be @xcite @xmath49 which is consistent with the independent determination of the yield of annihilations into pions alone @xcite @xmath50 among the contributions to @xmath51 are the  shake - out \" and  rearrangement \" processes we discuss , and the creation of new ss pairs in the annihilation final state . examples of the latter are provided by the kaonic decay modes of non - strange mesons such as the @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "combining their production branching ratios with their probabilities for decay into final states containing @xmath34 , one estimates a contribution to @xmath51 of @xmath55 of all annihilations .",
    "most of the remainder of @xmath51 could be due to  shake - out \" and  rearrangement \" contributions of the order of 4 % , which is comparable with ( [ per ] ) .",
    "indeed , it follows from ( [ sh ] ) that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the relative phase of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( complex ) coefficients .",
    "the value @xmath60 therefore leads to the limit @xmath61 which is consistent with ( [ per ] ) .",
    "the relative magnitude of the contribution from the creation of new @xmath35 pairs could in principle be probed by comparing @xmath51 ( [ yk ] ) with the kaon yield in @xmath62 scattering at the same centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the @xmath34 yield due to  shake - out \" or  rearrangement \" in pp annihilation could also have phase - space distribution different from that of ss pair creation . the latter would tend to be central and with low relative momenta , whereas  shake - out \" contributions could carry large momenta and emerge in the forward and backward directions from pp annihilation in flight .",
    "indeed , the observed @xcite backward peak in @xmath63 at @xmath64 was interpreted @xcite as evidence for strange quarks in the proton .",
    "recent experiments at lear and kek confirm existence of the strong backward peak at p momenta @xmath65 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "0.3 cm    additional evidence for the intrinsic strangeness picture comes from the experimental data on double @xmath66 production taken by the jetset collaboration at lear .",
    "navely , one would expect @xcite a cross section of the order of @xmath67 if both @xmath1 s were produced by independent ozi  violating couplings .",
    "the cross section measured @xcite at 16 different antiproton momentum settings spanning the region between 1 and 2 gev / c is however about 1500 nb , i.e. it exceeds the nave ozi rule estimate given above by at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "the intrinsic strangeness model easily accommodates this experimental observation , which could be due to either  shake  out \" or  rearrangement \" , with an amplitude @xmath68 .",
    "the limit ( [ limit ] ) would imply then @xmath69 the experimental value of the cross section corresponds to @xmath70 .",
    "the connected diagrams involving intrinsic strange quarks will likely mask any possible glueball resonance contributions which are expected to be dominant among the disconnected diagrams .",
    "no such resonances are observed at present @xcite .",
    "after this preparatory discussion of the intrinsic ss component of the nucleon and the  shakeout \" and  rearrangement \" processes , we now discuss specific features of @xmath1 production in pp annihilation at rest . the fact that the ratio of @xmath1 and @xmath71 yields in various individual channels exceeds the prediction of the nave ozi rule has been known for some time . in particular , the bubble chamber data of @xcite-@xcite on @xmath72 annihilation could be combined to estimate @xmath73 .",
    "however , the statistics was limited to 54 events in the @xmath74 channel @xcite .",
    "we also mention the value of @xmath75 inferred from analyses of the proton vector isoscalar form factor @xcite , @xcite in which the @xmath76 and @xmath77 coupling constants were treated as free parameters ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this value is compared with measurements of @xmath78 production ratios in fig.2 .",
    ", which is navely ozi - disallowed , but would be allowed if there is a higher @xmath79 fock - state component in the @xmath80 wave function . ]    as we now review , the advent of high - statistics experiments at lear has brought a new era in pp annihilation studies , with larger excesses in @xmath1 production above the nave ozi prediction established by the asterix @xcite , crystal barrel @xcite and obelix @xcite collaborations , as shown in fig.2 and table 2 .",
    "the asterix collaboration @xcite has measured the ratios of @xmath81 and @xmath82 final states with @xmath83 in s- and p - wave pp annihilation . as seen in table 2 ,",
    "the experimental values of r in different s - wave annihilation channels are mostly higher than the ozi prediction by a factor of 2 to 8 .",
    "the most striking variation in this trend is the very large enhancement in the case @xmath84 in s - wave annihilations , by a factor 20 or so .",
    "however , in p - wave annihilations there is no corresponding enhancement in the cases @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and only modest ( if any ) enhancement in the @xmath86 channels , as can be seen by comparing the yields from the different types of target .",
    "the crystal barrel collaboration @xcite has measured the ratios of @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 final states in pp annihilation in liquid hydrogen .",
    "they confirmed the asterix observation of a large deviation from the nave ozi rule ( [ r ] ) in the case @xmath90 , whilst the @xmath91 cases deviate only slightly ( if at all ) from ( [ r ] ) .",
    "however , their most striking result was an extremely large ratio in the case @xmath92 , which they found to be about 100 times higher than the nave ozi prediction .",
    "the obelix collaboration has complemented these results by measuring the @xmath93 ratios in n annihilations in liquid hydrogen @xcite , and in p annihilation on gaseous deuterium at different momenta of the spectator protons @xcite .",
    "large enhancements over the nave ozi prediction ( [ r ] ) were found in both the cases @xmath94 . 0.3 cm    we draw the reader s attention to the following salient features of @xmath1 production in nucleon annihilation at rest",
    "the channels @xmath95 , @xmath96 exhibit strong enhancement over the nave ozi prediction ( [ r ] ) , whereas there are only smaller enhancements in the channels @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and no evidence of any enhancement in @xmath100 .",
    "the amount of apparent ozi violation in annihilations at rest is much higher than what is seen in @xmath101 or pp scattering and higher - energy pp annihilation , as shown in table 1 and fig.2 .",
    "\\3 . in cases where the initial pp state is known",
    ", the large enhancement of @xmath95 appears to be restricted to the s - wave , with no large deviation from the nave prediction ( [ r ] ) in any p - wave annihilation channel .",
    "any model of the large rate of @xmath1 production in pp annihilation at rest should be able to predict or accommodate these three channel - dependent features .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the enhancement of @xmath1 meson production in certain @xmath102 annihilation channels might be due to resonances .",
    "specifically , if there existed a vector ( @xmath103 ) @xmath95 resonance close to the @xmath104 threshold , it might be possible to explain the selective enhancement of the @xmath95 yield in s - wave annihilation , and the relative lack of @xmath1 s in p - wave annihilation .",
    "the best candidate for such a state is one with mass @xmath105 mev , width @xmath106 mev and quantum numbers @xmath107 , which was observed @xcite in the @xmath108 mass spectrum in the reaction @xmath109 at 32.5 gev / c , and dubbed the c - meson .",
    "however , this resonance can not explain the even larger enhancement recently observed in the @xmath96 channel , which is a final state with different quantum numbers .",
    "moreover , the experimental status of the c - meson is unconfirmed .",
    "although some experiments have found indications for its existence ( for a review , see @xcite ) , others have not .",
    "in particular , the asterix collaboration @xcite has established an upper limit of @xmath110 on the production of any @xmath95 resonance in p annihilation in a hydrogen gas target , and the crystal barrel collaboration has not seen the c - meson among ( @xmath111 final states in p annihilation in a liquid hydrogen target @xcite .",
    "the predicted @xcite isoscalar partner of the c - meson which should couple to the @xmath100 channel also was not observed , and no deviation from the nave ozi rule has been detected in this mode ( see table 2 ) . therefore we discard the resonance interpretation of the apparent violation of the ozi rule .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested @xcite,@xcite that the @xmath1 mesons in the @xmath95 final state might be due to final - state interactions of the k and k in the @xmath112 channel that dominates the @xmath113 final state : @xmath114 one interesting test of this mechanism would be to see whether isospin i=1 amplitude of @xmath115 is larger in s - wave annihilation than in p - wave annihilations .",
    "if not , the large @xmath1 excess in s - wave annihilations could not be explained .",
    "however , the concrete calculations of @xmath1 production @xcite , @xcite made in different channels fall below the experimental data by factors of 2 to 6 or more . moreover , strong cancellations are expected between different hadronic loop amplitudes @xcite , @xcite , so these calculations can only be considered as upper limits at best .",
    "furthermore , as was pointed out in @xcite , the rescattering model can not explain why the ratio @xmath116 is smaller than @xmath117 , despite the fact that the @xmath118 final state is as copious as @xmath119 in @xmath120 annihilation .",
    "therefore the rescattering interpretation of the apparent violations of the ozi rule meets serious difficulties .",
    "as already mentioned above , we seek to explain @xmath1 enhancement in terms of the intrinsic strangeness component in the long  wavelength nucleon wave function . the key question to be addressed by",
    "this explanation is the channel dependence of the @xmath1 enhancement .",
    "as has been pointed out elsewhere @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , the @xmath35 component of the nucleon is expected to exhibit momentum and spin correlations that cause couplings to @xmath35 meson final states to be channel  dependent in general .",
    "we now construct a model for one aspect of this channel dependence suggested by experimental results on the polarization of strange quarks and antiquarks in the proton .",
    "results from the emc , smc , e142 and e143 collaborations @xcite indicate that they have a net polarization opposite to the proton spin @xcite : @xmath121 = - 0.08\\pm0.03.\\ ] ] for the sake of simplicity , let us consider the possibility that all the @xmath39 and @xmath38 in the proton are polarized negatively , and none positively .",
    "the simplest wave function of this higher fock - state component , consistent with the parity and spin constraints , corresponds to a spin - triplet s - wave @xmath122 state which is in a p wave relative to the  normal \" @xmath123 light @xmath124 component .",
    "the projection of the relative orbital momentum on the spin axis in this model is @xmath125 , so that the total angular momentum of the nucleon remains @xmath126 . in this case ,  shake  out \" into the @xmath127 strangeonium state , namely the @xmath1 , is likely to dominate over other hidden strangeness states such as the p  wave @xmath33 .",
    "now let us consider @xmath0 annihilation from a spin  triplet initial state , in which the @xmath128 and @xmath129 spins are parallel .",
    "in this case , @xmath38 and @xmath39 quarks in both nucleons  rearranged \" during the annihilation will also have parallel spins , as in the nave quark model wave function of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "further , if the @xmath120 initial state is s  wave , the @xmath35  pair will probably also be in an s  wave also as in the @xmath1  meson .",
    "therefore , we expect maximum enhancement of @xmath1  production in the @xmath127 channel , as observed in the @xmath95 final state .",
    "this model predicts weaker enhancements in the @xmath130 channel , as observed .",
    "0.3 cm    this model also suggests qualitatively why @xmath1  production may be enhanced more in @xmath0  annihilation  at rest than in the other @xmath0 , @xmath131 , and @xmath101 interactions .",
    "the reason is that higher  energy collisions involve an increasing mixture of partial waves , implying that the s  wave state ",
    "rearrangement \" that favours @xmath1  production becomes progressively more diluted .",
    "a corollary of this observation is that we would expect the large enhancement of @xmath132 to diminish as the centre  of  mass energy is increased .",
    "0.3 cm thus our heuristic polarization model predicts or accommodates the three salient features of the data noted earlier .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that our model is idealized .",
    "the approximation that all the @xmath38 and @xmath39 inside a proton are polarized antiparallel to its spin is very crude , the polarizations could be altered during the  shake  out \" or  rearrangement \" processes , and diagrams like those in fig.1b could make contributions to the production of @xmath1  s and other @xmath35  mesons that are independent of the initial spin state",
    ".    the reader might expect that the @xmath133 ratio would be enhanced at least as strongly as the @xmath117 ratio , since the favoured @xmath127 initial @xmath0  state also contributes .",
    "however , in this channel there are additional connected quark diagrams , ( shown in fig.3 ) because the @xmath134 has a substantial ( @xmath135 ) @xmath35   -component .",
    "fig.3a features the rearrangement of two @xmath35  pairs from the initial nucleon wave functions , and would require a spin - flip of at least one of the s or s to produce the @xmath100 final state from the @xmath127 initial state , according to our idealized model .",
    "fig.3b involves the annihilation of one @xmath35  pair and the subsequent creation of a new @xmath35  pair , and may be at least as important as fig.3a .",
    "the diagrams in fig.3 will interfere with the diagrams of fig.1 that contribute to @xmath95 production in our model .",
    "we do not know whether this interference is constructive or destructive , enhancing or suppressing the yield of @xmath100 relative to @xmath136 .",
    "however , the fact the @xmath35  components of the @xmath134 and @xmath137 wave functions have opposite signs means that the interferences in the @xmath100 and @xmath138 production amplitudes must have opposite signs , enhancing one while suppressing the other .",
    "the data in table 2 tell us that the @xmath100 channel is suppressed , enabling us to predict that the @xmath138 channel should be enhanced .",
    "since both @xmath1 and @xmath137 are heavier than the proton , this prediction can only be checked in @xmath0  annihilation  in flight .",
    "however , it should be noted that the favoured s - wave channel will be diluted for in - flight annihilation .    0.3 cm    it would be interesting to explore the dependence of the amount of the apparent ozi violation not only on the spin of the initial state but , for instance , on the momentum transfer . in an early experiment on @xmath1   production in @xmath139 interaction @xcite",
    "it was found that the @xmath140 distribution of @xmath1production at large @xmath141 differs significantly from the one for @xmath71-meson , leading to the increase of @xmath78 ratio at large @xmath141 .",
    "this effect was especially marked for unnatural - parity exchange .",
    "the production of the @xmath1 in antiproton annihilation at rest also seems to exhibit a dependence of the apparent ozi rule violation on the momentum transfer . in fig.4 the dependence of the ratios @xmath142 in different reactions",
    "is shown as a function of momentum transfer in @xmath143 ( see also fig.5 ) .",
    "the deviation from the nave ozi rule prediction increases with momentum transfer .",
    "0.3 cm    however one should be cautious in interpreting the dependence in fig.4 as a rigorous proof that the apparent ozi rule violation increases with momentum transfer .",
    "in the two - body antiproton annihilations at rest : @xmath144 , the momentum transfer to the @xmath71 is always higher than the momentum transfer to the @xmath1 .",
    "it is possible to compare @xmath1 and @xmath71 production at the same momentum transfer in annihilation in flight or in the @xmath145 channel for annihilation at rest .",
    "0.3 cm    the intrinsic strangeness model can also explain rather naturally a number of experimental facts on strange baryon production .",
    "for instance , it is well known @xcite that in the reaction @xmath146 the spins of the @xmath147 s exhibit strong correlations .",
    "although both spin singlet and triplet final states are possible , the spin singlet fraction is zero within statistical errors .",
    "the spin of the @xmath147 is largely carried by the spin of the strange quark , so the @xmath35   pair in the final state of ( [ ll ] ) must mostly have parallel spins .",
    "this could naturally be expected in the intrinsic strangeness model : a spin - triplet @xmath35   pair in the proton or antiproton may simply dissociate into a @xmath148 pair , conserving their spin correlation , which leads to a spin - triplet final state for the two hyperons .",
    "possible tests of our model include checks on the spin - dependences of amplitudes that violate the nave ozi rule , and on their momentum transfer dependences . 0.3 cm    1 .",
    "the arguments for @xmath95 enhancement in production from the @xmath127 initial state can be extended to other @xmath35  resonances , in particular to production of the @xmath149 compared to the @xmath150 . using the quadratic mass formula , as used to obtain the nave ozi estimate ( [ r ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath151 before applying phase space corrections .",
    "this may actually be an overestimate : the ozi  forbidden decay @xmath152 has been seen at a low rate relative to the ozi  allowed @xmath34 decay mode , corresponding to @xmath153 the @xmath149 was not seen by bubble chamber experiments in annihilations at rest , which gave an upper limit on the yield for @xmath154 of @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "comparison with the yield of @xmath156 production @xcite in the @xmath157 channel of @xmath158 shows that the present experimental information on the ratio @xmath159 ratio is rather inconclusive .",
    "0.3 cm    since the @xmath160 is a spin ",
    "triplet p  wave state in the nave quark model , the type of argument we used to motivate enhancement of @xmath1  production in @xmath127 @xmath0  annihilations would favour a large @xmath159 ratio in @xmath161 @xmath0  annihilations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath156 yield in p ",
    "wave @xmath0  annihilation  is known to be five times greater than in the s - wave : @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "if the above prediction of enhanced @xmath160 production is correct , and the effect is as large as in the @xmath127 @xmath1  production case , the signal for @xmath160 production in p ",
    "wave @xmath0  annihilation   should be clearly visible , with the branching ratio of @xmath163 possibly as large as 0.1 - 0.2 % .",
    "this suggestion could be tested in data recently taken by the obelix collaboration on @xmath0  annihilation in gaseous hydrogen at small pressure .",
    "there are already some data on @xmath164 production in @xmath0annihilation in flight @xcite,@xcite indicating substantial apparent violation of the nave ozi prediction ( [ f1])-([f2 ] ) , but the statistics in these experiments was scarce , and new high  statistics data are needed .",
    "0.3 cm    ref .",
    "@xcite considered production of @xmath160 in the @xmath165 reaction via final - state @xmath166 and @xmath167 interactions .",
    "the calculated production rates of @xmath160 from the s or p states were rather small , of the order @xmath168 .",
    "this means that , if any deviation from the nave ozi rule is established for @xmath160 , it could not be explained by rescattering .    2 .",
    "since annihilation at higher energies involves an increasing mixture of partial waves , the s - wave state  rearrangement \" that favours , for example , @xmath95 state production from the @xmath127 initial state , becomes more diluted ( see the discussion in sect.5 ) .",
    "we expect therefore that the @xmath117 ratio measured in annihilation in flight will decline , following the decreasing admixture of the @xmath127 state .",
    "recent preliminary results from the crystal barrel experiment @xcite indicate that the branching ratio of the @xmath108 channel decreases approximately 5 times when the momentum of the antiproton is increased to @xmath169 whereas the branching ratio of the @xmath166 stays constant .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that at @xmath169 the percentage of s - wave in @xmath120 annihilation is about @xmath170 @xcite .",

    "our model predicts that an even larger deviation from the nave ozi rule should be seen in an experiment with polarized beam and target when an initial spin - triplet state is prepared . in a spin - singlet state",
    "the apparent ozi violation should , according to our model , be less pronounced . 0.3 cm    4 .",
    "an interesting possibility for testing the model is provided by the @xmath99 final state where , contrary to two - particle channels for @xmath1 production , annihilation in the same partial wave is possible from both the spin - triplet and spin - singlet states . a spin - parity analysis of the dalitz plot for @xmath172 annihilation should demonstrate dominance of the @xmath127 initial state , if our hypothesis is correct .",
    "0.3 cm    5 .",
    "it is interesting to study the spin structure of the ozi - allowed process @xmath173 if intrinsic strangeness manifests itself also in ozi - allowed processes , spin correlations should appear in the final state .",
    "for example , when the initial @xmath0 pair is in the spin - triplet state , the final @xmath174 channel should be dominated by the @xmath175 state .",
    "0.3 cm    6 .",
    "the largest violation of the nave ozi rule occurs in the @xmath96 channel ( see table 2 ) .",
    "this channel was measured for antiproton annihilation in liquid , where s - wave annihilation is dominant .",
    "the @xmath96 final state is possible either from spin - singlet @xmath130 or from spin - triplet @xmath176 states .",
    "if the @xmath1 production is really enhanced for spin - triplet states , then one would expect that the ratio @xmath177 will increase for annihilation in hydrogen gas at normal temperature and pressure or at low pressure , where the p - wave annihilation is dominant .",
