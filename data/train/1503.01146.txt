    "broad emission lines are a hallmark property of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , first highlighted in pioneering work by @xcite . originating from the broad - line region ( blr ) , they serve as important diagnostics of physical conditions within the agn as well as dynamical tracers providing information about the mass of the supermassive black hole at the core of the agn central engine . unfortunately , even for the nearest agns",
    "the blr is too small to be directly resolved by any current observational capability .",
    "for example , in the well - studied nearby seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 , the radius of the h@xmath0-emitting portion of the blr is @xmath3 light - days @xcite , corresponding to an angular radius of just 945 microarcseconds .",
    "although the spatial structure of the blr can not be directly resolved , the time - variable nature of agn emission makes it possible to resolve the blr s size and structure in the time domain via reverberation mapping @xcite . ionizing photons from the agn s central engine",
    "are reprocessed by blr gas into emission - line photons . from the vantage point of a distant observer",
    ", random variations in the flux of the agn continuum will be followed by corresponding variations in the fluxes of emission lines from the blr , with a time delay that depends on the light - travel time across the blr .",
    "cross - correlation of emission - line light curves against light curves of the agn continuum gives a measure of the blr radius @xmath4 , under the assumption that the size of the continuum emission region is much smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "reverberation mapping thus requires measurement of light curves of the variable agn continuum and emission lines , with a cadence sufficient to resolve the temporal fluctuations adequately .",
    "when @xmath4  is combined with a velocity parameter measured from the width of the broad line , a so - called virial mass estimate can be derived for the central black hole .",
    "virial masses have been determined through reverberation mapping for several dozen low - redshift agns , and these measurements form the foundation of secondary `` single - epoch '' virial mass methods , which provide nearly all of the empirical information currently available on the cosmological growth history and redshift evolution of supermassive black holes ( for a comprehensive review , see * ? ? ?",
    "a major goal for reverberation mapping observations is the detection of velocity - resolved emission - line variations  that is , variations in the shapes of broad emission - line profiles , not merely variations in total emission - line flux .",
    "line profile variability conveys information about the kinematics of blr gas .",
    "measurements of profile variability can provide a means to discriminate between rotationally dominated , inflowing , or outflowing blr kinematics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while high - cadence and high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) observations can potentially reveal a wealth of detail about blr structure and kinematics @xcite .",
    "it is a nontrivial challenge to obtain observations with sufficiently high cadence and high s / n suitable for measurement of broad - line profile variations .",
    "consequently , many of the largest reverberation - mapping programs have focused largely on measurement of flux variations and derivation of black hole virial masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "over the past decade or so , various observing programs have succeeded in measuring velocity - resolved variability signatures in broad h@xmath0 ; an early example was a sparsely sampled program at the hobby - eberly telescope targeting mrk 110 @xcite .",
    "more recently , densely sampled observing campaigns have led to rapid progress . using data from the 2008 lick agn monitoring project campaign , a 64-night program carried out at the lick 3 m telescope ,",
    "@xcite detected a strong gradient in the reverberation lag across the h@xmath0  line profile in arp 151 ( mrk 40 ) , and the campaign provided some degree of velocity resolution of the h@xmath0  reverberation lag in five additional agns .",
    "similarly , intensive monitoring campaigns carried out at the mdm observatory have recently yielded impressive detections of velocity - resolved reverberation @xcite .",
    "the collective results of these programs suggest a surprising diversity in the kinematic properties of agns , with different objects exhibiting behavior consistent with rotation , infall , or outflow as the dominant kinematic behavior in the blr .",
    "these high - cadence monitoring programs at lick and mdm have spurred the development of new methods for analysis of reverberation data .",
    "the traditional approach of deriving black hole masses by applying a simple recipe to derive the `` virial product '' [ vp @xmath5 , where @xmath4  is determined from the reverberation lag and @xmath6 is a measure of the broad - line width ] suffers from several shortcomings .",
    "in particular , the `` blr radius '' measured from the reverberation lag gives a highly oversimplified measure of blr structure , since the blr actually spans a very broad range in radius .",
    "similarly , a single measure of blr velocity derived from an emission - line width is a gross oversimplification of the complex velocity structure of a real blr .",
    "more worrying is the possibility that the blr dynamics might be affected by outflows or other nongravitational motions , in which case simple virial mass estimates might be entirely misleading @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a different approach to reverberation data analysis , in which black hole masses can be determined via a forward - modeling procedure that computes the response to continuum variations of a physically motivated dynamical model for blr clouds . by exploring a broad parameter space of blr dynamical models and comparing the model predictions directly with the observed time series of broad emission - line profiles , direct constraints can be placed on the black hole mass , blr inclination and opening angle , radial emissivity profile , and other parameters .",
    "this approach has been applied to several agns from our high - cadence lick programs @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented applications of an independent implementation of a similar method to archival data from several observing campaigns .",
    "although reverberation mapping has seen dramatic progress over the past several years stemming from these high - cadence monitoring campaigns , there are still only a handful of agns having time - series data with sufficient sampling and s / n for these dynamical modeling methods to be optimally successful . in order to obtain more velocity - resolved reverberation data suitable for dynamical modeling , we embarked on a new reverberation mapping program in the spring of 2011 .",
    "spectroscopic observations were conducted at the lick 3 m shane telescope , and @xmath7-band photometric monitoring was carried out using several queue - scheduled and robotic telescopes .",
    "this paper describes the spectroscopic campaign and presents measurements from the lick data .",
    "a new aspect of our data analysis for this 2011 program is the use of spectral fitting and decomposition techniques to isolate different portions of the variable spectra . in the past",
    ", nearly all emission - line light curves for reverberation mapping were measured by subtracting a local , linear continuum model underlying strong emission lines such as h@xmath0  in order to isolate the emission - line flux .",
    "this method is generally effective for measuring integrated light curves of strong emission lines having high variability amplitude .",
    "however , simple linear continuum subtraction is unable to remove host - galaxy starlight features that can affect the broad - line profiles and widths , and it can not disentangle blended emission lines . the alternative approach of fitting models to deblend components such as from h@xmath0  had seldom been applied to nightly spectra from reverberation campaigns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our initial experiments with spectral decomposition using observations of mrk 50 from this program established that multicomponent fits made it possible to measure light curves for @xmath8 even when the line was heavily diluted by starlight , and to detect variability and measure reverberation lags of the optical blends @xcite . using a similar fitting method",
    ", @xcite carried out decompositions of spectra from the 2008 lick agn monitoring project campaign @xcite .",
    "this work demonstrated clear improvements in determination of the mean and root - mean square ( rms ) line profiles for h@xmath0  after removal of the host - galaxy starlight and other blended line components from the spectra . in this paper , we present a complete description of our fitting method and results from applying the spectroscopic decomposition procedure to our full 2011 monitoring sample .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : sampleselection ] describes the sample selection , and  [ sec : observations ] describes the spectroscopic observations carried out at lick .",
    "details of the data reduction , calibrations , and the fitting procedure applied to the blue - side spectra are given in ",
    "[ sec : dataprocessing ] .",
    "sections [ sec : lightcurves ] and [ sec : linewidths ] present the measurements of emission - line light curves , broad h@xmath0  line widths , and velocity centroid variations .",

    "[ sec : velocityshifts ] we describe how broad - line velocity shifts induced by asymmetric emission - line reverberation can potentially mimic the observational signature of orbital motion in a binary black hole system , and we consider the implications of broad - line reverberation for spectroscopic binary black hole searches . section [ sec : conclusions ] presents a summary of our results and conclusions . in appendix",
    "[ appendix : discardedtargets ] , we display spectra of additional agns that were observed during the first few nights of our program as we finalized our target list for monitoring .",
    "appendices [ appendix : widthsimulations ] and [ appendix : biases ] present simulations designed to clarify the relationship between line widths measured from mean and rms spectra , and to demonstrate potential sources of bias that can afflict broad - line widths measured from rms spectra .",
    "the major science goal for this program was to measure velocity - resolved reverberation signals in h@xmath0  for bright seyfert 1 galaxies , and we primarily selected targets having strong broad h@xmath0  emission from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 archive @xcite and other agn catalogs in the literature .",
    "our reverberation campaign began in late march and continued through the middle of june .",
    "this set a requirement for the sample to contain agns distributed over a broad range of right ascension such that the entire sample could be observed over nearly the full duration of the program .",
    "targets were selected to have apparent magnitudes of @xmath9 so that high - s / n spectra could be obtained in short exposures ( 1040 min ) .",
    "we chose agns for which estimated h@xmath0  reverberation lags were @xmath10 days based on either the radius - luminosity relation from @xcite or previous reverberation measurements .",
    "finally , the standard configuration of the kast spectrograph employs a 600-line grism in the blue camera and a dichroic with cutoff wavelength 5500  , and the blue - camera throughput drops steeply at @xmath11  .",
    "this imposes a practical redshift limit of @xmath12 in order for [ ] @xmath13 to fall on the high - sensitivity portion of the blue camera .",
    "this line is used as the reference for flux calibration of the spectral time series .",
    "two targets , mrk 817 and zw 229 - 015 , were included in the sample in order to coordinate with a _ spitzer _ infrared monitoring program taking place in 2011 ( _ spitzer _ program i d 70119 ; pi v. gorjian ) .",
    "zw 229 - 015 was also a _",
    "kepler _ monitoring target during this time @xcite .",
    "we assembled an initial set of 15 high - priority targets plus several alternates which included narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies , agns that were somewhat fainter than our primary targets , and candidate agns for which no high - quality recent spectra were available in the literature . during the first few usable nights of the campaign",
    ", we found that three of our top - priority targets selected from sdss had transformed into type 1.9 seyferts with essentially no broad h@xmath0  emission remaining ( see appendix [ appendix : discardedtargets ] for details ) .",
    "several alternate targets were then observed and we chose the most promising ones to fill the gaps in the sample s right ascension range . our final monitoring sample is listed in table [ sampleproperties ] , and appendix [ appendix : discardedtargets ] presents spectra of the alternate and discarded targets .    some of these agns have been observed in previous reverberation programs , including mrk 40 ( arp 151 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mrk 279 @xcite , mrk 817 @xcite , ngc 4593 @xcite , and zw 229 - 015 @xcite .",
    "revised lag measurements of mrk 279 , mrk 817 , and ngc 4593 were also given in the compilation of @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite presented results from a reverberation campaign that included mrk 486 and mrk 493 as well .",
    "new observations of previously well - observed targets such as mrk 40 can potentially test whether velocity - resolved reverberation lags remain constant or vary over durations comparable to the dynamical timescale of the blr .",
    "owing to the combination of criteria given above , the observed sample is not complete or unbiased in terms of black hole mass , luminosity , broad - line width , or any other fundamental or observed property .",
    "this is a recurring issue for all agn reverberation mapping campaigns to date , and should be kept in mind when extrapolating reverberation results to derive single - epoch masses for agns at high luminosities or eddington ratios not probed by the reverberation - mapped sample .",
    "this point has been emphasized by @xcite and @xcite in the context of examining biases inherent in single - epoch masses derived from the line .",

    ", we opted to use only afternoon dome - flat exposures rather than observing dome flats at the position of each agn during the nights .",
    "this trade - off compromises the data quality of the red - side exposures at wavelengths longer than 7000  , but it does not affect the blue - side data which are the main focus of our reverberation measurements .",

    "additionally , the flux - scaling method applied to the spectra relies on the assumption of a constant [ ] flux , and observing at a fixed pa ensures consistency in the portion of the narrow - line region subtended by the slit , which can be important for low - redshift agns having spatially extended emission .",

    "then , @xmath59 is a measure of the fractional rms scatter in the light curve over and above the amount expected from the propagated uncertainties ; we refer to this quantity as the `` normalized excess scatter . ''",
    "we measured @xmath59 from the [ ] light curves for each agn , and the values are listed in table [ oiiitable ] .",
    "the values of @xmath59 range from 0.005 to 0.033 ( i.e. , the excess scatter in the light curves ranges from 0.5% to 3.3% of the mean [ ] fluxes ) .",
    "the objects with the highest [ ] photometric scatter tend to be agns having low [ ] equivalent width , such as mrk 50 and mrk 493 , for which the @xcite scaling method does not work optimally .",
    "we interpret @xmath59 as a measure of the level of random error in the final flux normalization of the spectra . for measurements of reverberation lags or other quantities from the light curve ,",
    "this source of error can be incorporated into the measurement error budget by adding @xmath60 in quadrature to the photon - counting uncertainties on each light - curve point @xmath61 .",
    "since the spectral scaling is optimized for the wavelength of the [ ] @xmath13 line , the relative scaling at much longer or shorter wavelengths is expected to be worse than the amount indicated by @xmath59 , as a result of atmospheric dispersion and wavelength - dependent slit losses .    after applying the scaling procedure ,",
    "mean and rms spectra are constructed following @xcite .",
    "the mean spectrum is a simple average of the individual nightly spectra .",
    "the rms spectrum is calculated by taking the standard deviation of flux values at each pixel over the time series , and gives an illustration of the relative variability amplitude of different spectral regions .",
    "other prescriptions for calculating rms spectra have been explored by @xcite . since the rms spectrum includes the contribution of photon - counting noise and other sources of noise or random error in the data , in addition to genuine agn variability , the amplitude of the rms spectrum is higher than it would be for the ideal case of noise - free data .",
    "simulations presented in appendix [ appendix : biases ] demonstrate that photon - counting noise will bias the widths of broad lines in rms spectra to values that are typically several percent lower than they would be in the absence of noise .",
    "the red - side data were generally flux - calibrated using standard - star observations obtained simultaneously with the blue - side standard - star observations . in the reduced data , the region of wavelength overlap between the blue - side and red - side spectra is 54205500  .",
    "for each agn observation , we normalized the red - side flux scale by applying a scaling factor to match it to the scaled blue - side spectrum over this wavelength range , and then produced mean and rms spectra from these rescaled red - side data .",
    "figure [ meanspectra ] displays the mean spectra of each agn from the blue and red camera data combined .",
    "for a few of the agns , we found that h@xmath15  light curves measured from these rescaled spectra had noticeably larger scatter in flux values than the h@xmath0  light curves .",
    "this large excess scatter for the red - side data probably arises from a combination of the nonparallactic slit orientation , the seeing - dependent ratio of agn to host - galaxy continuum flux , and the fact that the spectral normalization is optimized for wavelengths close to [ ] .",
    "large excess scatter was particularly noticeable in the h@xmath15  light curves of mrk 40 and mrk 279 .",
    "for both of these objects , we applied the @xcite scaling method separately to the red - side spectra , using the [ ] @xmath62 line as a reference .",
    "this significantly improved the quality of the h@xmath15  light curves for these two objects , although a few extreme outlier points were still present in the data . for other objects",
    ", we found that either rescaling using [ ] did not noticeably improve the h@xmath15  light curves , or , in some cases such as mrk 50 , [ ] was too weak to use as a reference line in the spectral scaling .",
    "we experimented with using the [ ] doublet as the reference line , but this produced poor results because [ ] is very weak in most of these agns and is usually blended with the red wing of h@xmath15 .",
    "traditionally , measurements of emission - line fluxes for reverberation mapping have been carried out by selecting two regions nearly free of emission lines on either side of the emission line of interest , then fitting and subtracting a straight line to model and remove the continuum underlying the emission line .",
    "while this procedure is simple to implement and can generally produce accurate light curves for strong emission lines , there are several drawbacks associated with it .",
    "a straight - line fit does not adequately represent the shape of the starlight continuum , which often makes a significant contribution to the spectra of seyfert 1 nuclei ( particularly when observed through a wide slit ) .",
    "stellar absorption features in the host - galaxy starlight produce wiggles and bumps that become superposed on the broad h@xmath0  line profile ( including stellar h@xmath0  absorption ) , and these contaminating features are not removed when a straight - line continuum is assumed .",
    "furthermore , while there are some regions around h@xmath0  where the flux from other emission lines is relatively low , there may still be contributions from weak features such as or in the selected continuum fitting regions , and it is effectively impossible to define a true continuum region that is entirely devoid of agn emission features .",
    "these issues can compromise measurements of emission - line light curves and broad - line widths or profile shapes in the mean and rms spectra .",
    "measurements of velocity - resolved lags in the h@xmath0  line can be compromised by blending with , , and if these features are not removed before measurement of the reverberation signals , and biased determination of the true continuum level owing to contamination by blended lines or starlight could affect measurements of the lag in the faint high - velocity wings of h@xmath0 .",
    "in addition to strong lines such as h@xmath0 , it is also of interest to measure light curves for weaker features including or , but these lines can be severely blended with each other as well as with starlight and other spectral components , and a straight - line continuum fit is usually not adequate for isolating the contributions of weaker broad lines to the spectrum .    in order to address these problems ,",
    "we have implemented a spectral fitting method which , when applied to each nightly spectrum from a reverberation campaign , decomposes the data into independent spectral components .",
    "fitting of agn spectra to deblend line and continuum components ( including the broad blends ) has a long history with many different implementations in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but only recently have such methods been applied to time - series spectroscopic data from reverberation campaigns .",
    "the procedure described below is an updated version of the method applied to our data in earlier papers in this series @xcite , with several minor modifications and improvements .",
    "the method described by @xcite uses a different fitting procedure and a different set of model components , but we find that measurements of h@xmath0  light curves and other parameters are very similar when carried out using the results of the two independent fitting codes when applied to the same set of input spectra .    the primary goal of our procedure is to provide an accurate fit to the region surrounding h@xmath0  so that the broad h@xmath0  profile can be isolated from other features .",
    "consequently , accurate fitting over a small wavelength region is a higher priority than fitting the entire available wavelength range of the observations .",
    "fits to a larger wavelength region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would include several additional emission lines that are of little direct interest for the reverberation measurement , and extending the fitting region blueward could compromise the accuracy of the fit in the h@xmath0  region owing to the complexity of the spectrum at bluer wavelengths .",
    "we fit only the blue - side spectra , and the redward limit of the fits is set by the red end of the blue - side ccd data .",
    "fits were carried out over a rest wavelength range of approximately 42005300  , with slight differences for each agn depending on redshift , and the fitting procedure is applied to the data after scaling by the @xcite procedure .",
    "the levenberg - marquardt routines in the idl ` mpfit ` package @xcite are employed for @xmath50 minimization to optimize the fits , using the propagated error spectra for determination of @xmath50 .",
    "the model components and parameters are as follows .",
    "_ starlight _ : we used an 11  gyr , solar metallicity , single - burst spectrum from @xcite to model the host - galaxy starlight .",
    "we additionally carried out tests in which a younger ( 290 myr ) population component was added .",
    "its contribution was generally small and not well constrained , and it was omitted in the final fits . during the fitting process , the starlight spectrum was rebinned to a log - linear wavelenth scale , broadened by convolution with a gaussian kernel , and then rebinned again to match the linear wavelength scale of the data .",
    "free parameters include the flux normalization of the starlight spectrum , the redshift , and the velocity width of the broadening kernel .",
    "since the spectral resolution of the @xcite spectra differs from the lick data , the convolution kernel width does not directly correspond to the actual stellar velocity dispersion in the host galaxy .",
    "the velocity - broadening dispersion parameter was limited to a maximum value of 350 km  s@xmath2  in order to prevent it from increasing to unphysically large values ; this limit was reached only for mrk 486 , in which stellar absorption features are essentially invisible over the wavelength range of the fits .",
    "_ agn featureless continuum _ : the agn continuum was modeled as a power law , with free parameters including the flux normalization at rest wavelength 5100   and the power - law spectral index . over the wavelength range that was fitted , balmer continuum emission does not contribute to the spectrum .",
    "we do not ascribe any physical meaning to night - to - night changes in the best - fitting spectral index , since these can be caused by wavelength - dependent slit losses resulting from differential atmospheric refraction and variable seeing .    _",
    "[ ] _ : a fourth - order gauss - hermite function @xcite was used to model the [ ] @xmath13 profile .",
    "free parameters included the amplitude , centroid wavelength , line dispersion , and the higher - order moments @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the 4959   line was modeled with the same velocity profile and an amplitude fixed to 1/3 of that the 5007   line , and a fixed rest - frame wavelength separation of 47.9  .",
    "a fourth - order gauss - hermite function proved to be adequate for modeling the [ ] profiles well in all but one of the agns ; as described below , we modified the set of fit components for mrk 279 .    _ h@xmath0 _ : for the broad component of h@xmath0 , a fourth - order gauss - hermite function was used .",
    "this provides sufficient flexibility to fit the broad - line profiles for nearly all of the agns well , with the exception of objects such as mrk 141 having distinct shoulders or humps on their profiles .",
    "free parameters include the broad component centroid , dispersion , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and amplitude .",
    "the narrow component was set to have a profile identical to [ ] , but a small shift was allowed in the wavelength centroid of the narrow component as another free parameter .",
    "_ _ : the @xmath8 line was modeled as the sum of two gaussians representing the broad and narrow components . for each component ,",
    "free parameters included the centroid , dispersion , and amplitude .",
    "initial trial fits indicated that the broad and narrow components sometimes had offset centroid wavelengths , and for some agns the fits failed noticeably when the two components were forced to have the same centroid . in some cases",
    "this might be the result of broad @xmath65 being present in the data but not included as a fit component .",
    "if the broad model component incorporated some @xmath65 flux then this would induce a spurious but small redward shift relative to its true wavelength .",
    "@xcite illustrate examples of fits that include both @xmath8 and @xmath65 , but since these features are badly degenerate in broad - lined agns we do not attempt to include the @xmath65 line in our fits as a separate component .    _ _ : we included the possible contributions of broad lines at 4471 , 4922 , and 5016   rest wavelength . in order to keep the number of free parameters to a minimum for these relatively weak lines , we used gaussian profiles and followed @xcite in setting the 4922 and 5016   lines to have the same amplitude , but we did not force any relationship between the amplitudes of these lines and the 4471   line .",
    "all three lines were assumed to have identical velocity widths , and their velocity centroids were set to be identical to that of h@xmath0 .",
    "the components thus required only three additional free parameters to represent the amplitudes and widths of these features .",
    "the 4922 and 5016   lines are in the `` red shelf '' of h@xmath0 , and are blended with the red wing of h@xmath0 , the [ ] lines , and with features @xcite .",
    "in fact the 4922 and 5016   lines are nearly degenerate with two features that appear in the iron templates .",
    "the amplitude of these two features in the fits depends strongly on which template is chosen . while the sum of the and fluxes in this spectral region is fairly well determined by the fits , we do not attempt to extract light curves because of the ambiguity in separating these features from the emission . for most agns ,",
    "the best - fitting amplitude of the @xmath66 line is either zero or negligibly small , regardless of template choice .    _",
    "_ : the blends of broad emission were modeled using template spectra , including those described by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we carried out fits separately with each of these templates in order to examine systematic differences in the results .",
    "template spectra were convolved with a gaussian kernel in velocity space , similar to the broadening of the starlight spectrum described above . in each case , free parameters included the velocity shift relative to broad h@xmath0 , the broadening kernel width , and the normalization of the broadened template spectrum .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite templates are monolithic and only one normalization parameter is required . the @xcite template",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is composed of five separate templates representing different emission multiplet groups , and a normalization parameter is required for each one . in a given spectral fit using the @xcite templates , each of the five templates was assumed to have the same velocity broadening and velocity shift .",
    "the @xcite templates are distributed with a discrete sequence of velocity broadenings , and we used the narrowest templates ( corresponding to 700 km  s@xmath2  broadening ) and then applied a gaussian velocity broadening during the fitting process as described above .",
    "examination of the fits for a very narrow - lined agn such as mrk 493 clearly illustrate the contribution of in the red wings of both h@xmath0  and [ ] @xmath13 , while in more typical broad - lined agns these features are more difficult to identify individually and their contribution to this spectral region may be less obvious unless a multicomponent fit is carried out .",
    "_ reddening _ :",
    "all model components were reddened by a @xcite reddening law , with @xmath67 as a free parameter in the fit .",
    "this parameter accounts for possible reddening within the agn host galaxy as well as galactic reddening , and also accounts for possible errors in relative flux calibration resulting from the nonparallactic slit orientation or other wavelength - dependent flux calibration errors .",
    "for some agns , the best - fitting values of @xmath67 varied significantly from night to night , and we do not interpret the fitted parameter values as actual measurements of the reddening toward the agns . in principle , the agn continuum and blr , nlr , and host - galaxy light could have different line - of - sight reddening , but the data would not provide sufficient constraints to obtain meaningful values of reddening for these components independently .    in the h@xmath0  and [ ] models , the wings of gauss - hermite functions can extend to negative values for certain values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "negative values were clipped and replaced with zero .",
    "this only affects the distant wings of line profiles and has a very minor effect on the fits .",
    "other emission lines are present in the spectrum that could be fitted by adding components and free parameters to the model , but we chose to restrict the number of components to those listed above in order to avoid either slowing down the fitting procedure or introducing additional fitting degeneracies . instead , other emission features were accounted for simply by setting a wavelength region around those features to have zero weight in the fits .",
    "the largest feature that was masked out was the blend of h@xmath68  and [ ] @xmath69 .",
    "this blend typically has a complex shape that , if included in the fit , would require three overlapping gauss - hermite or gaussian components and potentially nine or more additional free parameters .",
    "the masked region corresponded to 42804400   ( rest wavelength ) but was adjusted in a few cases for objects having very broad lines .",
    "we also masked out a small region around the narrow [ ] lines at 5199 and 5201  .",
    "our procedure fits all of these spectral components to the data simultaneously , in contrast to other methods which fit and remove continuum and components prior to fitting the h@xmath0  profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "fits were carried out separately using each of the three templates .",
    "the total number of free parameters in the fits is 29 when the monolithic templates are used , or 33 when the multicomponent @xcite templates are used . for each agn , the mean spectrum",
    "was fitted first , and then the best - fit parameters determined for the high s / n mean spectrum were used as the initial parameters for the fits to each nightly spectrum . in most cases , fits using the @xcite templates returned the best @xmath70 values , and we use these templates for the final fit results presented in this paper .",
    "figure [ fetemplates ] illustrates the systematic differences between the three templates when fitted to the spectrum of mrk 493 , which has the strongest and narrowest lines of the agns in our sample .",
    "the template differences are most pronounced at wavelengths underlying the broad h@xmath68  and h@xmath0  lines and the h@xmath0  red shelf region .",
    "the fitting procedure was modified for mrk 279 .",
    "its [ ] lines are unusually broad with strong asymmetric blue wings which contribute substantially to the `` red shelf '' region redward of h@xmath0 , and the 4th - order gauss - hermite model gave a poor fit to the [ ] doublet leaving very strong residuals in this region . for this object",
    ", we removed the components from the model ( since they did not appear to be necessary in this case ) and replaced them with two additional gaussian components representing the blue wings of the [ ] @xmath71 lines .",
    "the h@xmath0  model also required modifications . in order to prevent the broad h@xmath0  width from blowing up to arbitrarily high values due to fitting degeneracy in the red wing",
    ", we restricted the broad component model to @xmath72  .",
    "we also found that the narrow component of h@xmath0  had a significantly different profile from [ ] in mrk 279 , and allowed the width of narrow h@xmath0  to vary rather than tying it to the [ ] width .",
    "this resulted in @xmath58(h@xmath0@xmath73)@xmath74 ( [ ] ) .",
    "the best fits to the mean spectrum of each agn , using the @xcite template , are shown in figure [ spectralfits ] .",
    "for each spectrum , the best - fitting model components are saved .",
    "additionally , we save the decomposed h@xmath0  profile , made by subtracting all model components other than h@xmath0  from the original spectrum .",
    "this spectrum also contains the h@xmath68 + [ ] blend as part of the fitting residual .",
    "we save two versions of this spectrum , one including and one excluding the narrow h@xmath0  component .",
    "these decomposed spectra ( rather than the noise - free models ) are used for measurement of the h@xmath0  light curves and line widths .",
    "figure [ hbetacomps ] illustrates examples of the decomposed h@xmath0  profiles and component models for six agns from a single night s data .",
    "the fitting procedure returns estimates of uncertainties on each of the free parameters .",
    "however , for measurements of emission - line light curves , what is needed is an estimate of the uncertainty on the flux density at each pixel for a particular spectral component such as h@xmath0 .",
    "we employed a monte carlo procedure to estimate the flux uncertainties . for each spectrum , after finding the best model fit , we created 100 modified versions of the spectrum by adjusting each pixel by a random gaussian deviate drawn from a distribution with a gaussian dispersion equal to the amplitude of the propagated error spectrum at that pixel .",
    "the spectral fit was then repeated for each of the 100 randomly deviated spectra , and the individual fit components were saved . for each spectral component ,",
    "the value of the error spectrum at a given pixel was taken to be the standard deviation of the flux values from the 100 re - fitted versions of that spectral component .",
    "similarly , we produced error spectra for the decomposed h@xmath0  profiles by taking the standard deviation of the 100 monte carlo realizations of the decomposed profile ( i.e. , the deviated spectrum minus all best - fit components other than h@xmath0 ) .    from this procedure , we found that the error spectrum of the decomposed h@xmath0  profile has an amplitude at each spectral pixel that is nearly equal to that of the original error spectrum , but noisier as a result of the limited number of monte carlo iterations .",
    "based on the results of this procedure , we adopt the original error spectrum as our best estimate of the pixel uncertainties on the individual emission - line component spectra that we use to measure light curves .",
    "the error spectra do not incorporate possible systematic uncertainties due to differences between templates or the choice of a particular host - galaxy starlight model .    using the fit results , we constructed revised mean and rms spectra .",
    "figure [ meanrmsspectra ] shows the original mean and rms spectra along with mean and rms spectra constructed after subtraction of the best - fitting starlight and agn featureless continuum components from each nightly spectrum . in some cases such as mrk 279 , the h@xmath0  profile in the rms spectrum changes significantly after subtraction of the continuum components ; similar results have previously been discussed by @xcite . additionally , for some agns the profiles in rms spectra are significantly altered by removal of the continuum components ; these changes are particularly prominent in mrk 504 and mrk 1511 .",
    "another version of the rms spectrum was constructed by subtracting all model components other than broad h@xmath0  from the nightly spectra .",
    "this version isolates the variability of the broad h@xmath0  line itself , and was used to measure the width of the h@xmath0  rms profile as described in section [ sec : linewidths ] .",
    "figure [ mrk40rmscomparison ] shows multiple versions of the rms spectrum for mrk 40 to illustrate the changes when different spectral components are subtracted prior to calculating the rms flux .",
    "one advantage of subtracting narrow emission - line components prior to constructing the rms spectrum is that the residual noise from these intrinsically nonvariable features is significantly reduced .",
    "this is clearly apparent for the [ ] lines in mrk 40 ( figure [ mrk40rmscomparison ] ) .    in future work",
    ", a variety of possible extensions and improvements to the fitting method can be explored .",
    "these include ( a ) addition of model components for other emission lines such as h@xmath68  and [ ] @xmath69 instead of simply masking them out from the fit ; ( b ) broadening the wavelength range of the fit blueward down to the near - uv atmospheric cutoff , and redward to h@xmath15 ; ( c ) inclusion of multiple - age stellar populations ; ( d ) addition of a balmer continuum component for fits extending below the balmer break ; ( e ) use of higher - order models to achieve more accurate fits to strong lines such as [ ] @xmath13 and for irregular or double - peaked broad balmer lines ; ( f ) exploration of different methods for constraining the decomposition in the h@xmath0  red shelf region ; ( g ) allowing for the possibility that different reddening values or even different reddening laws might apply to spectral components originating at different spatial scales .",
    "the possible benefits of these improvements must however be weighed against the increased complexity that comes with adding more free parameters and the degeneracies among them , particularly for the continuum components .",
    "furthermore , since the primary goal is often to achieve the most accurate fit to the wavelength region surrounding h@xmath0 , care must be taken to ensure that fitting a broader wavelength range does not worsen the fit in this region .",
    "the available set of templates remains a fundamental limitation and source of systematic uncertainty in the fits , and further work to develop more flexible sets of templates , both theoretical and emipirical , covering the full uv / optical wavelength range , would be extremely valuable for future reverberation mapping .",
    "light curves for broad emission lines were measured by direct integration of spectra .",
    "the epoch of each observation is given by the heliocentric julian date ( hjd ) determined from the ut date saved in the fits image headers , using the iraf ` setjd ` routine . to measure the h@xmath0  and h@xmath68  light curves for each night s observation of an agn",
    ", we began with the observed spectrum and subtracted all of the best - fitting model components except for the broad and narrow h@xmath0  models .",

    "this noise continuum level in the rms spectra is generally flat and featureless outside the h@xmath0  profile ( as seen in the bottom panel of figure [ mrk40rmscomparison ] ) and can be subtracted off with a simple linear fit to regions on either side of the line . for each agn we selected broad continuum windows redward and",

    "widths measured from the rms profiles for these low - variability agns have large uncertainties and would not be particularly useful for deriving estimates of black hole masses , despite the fact that some of these low - variability agns appear to show clear signal at h@xmath0  in the rms spectra ( figure [ meanrmsspectra ] ) .    an important caveat for the line width measurements , particularly for the line dispersions ,",

    "the temporal mismatch between line width and continuum flux measurements can be partially alleviated by selecting continuum and emission - line measurements that are separated by the measured emission - line lag time @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the frequent weather - related gaps in our light curves do not leave enough matched pairs of data points to obtain clear results .",
    "another possibility would be to interpolate the data to obtain matched pairs of line widths and continuum fluxes after correcting for the broad - line lag time , but we will defer that investigation in order to use the higher - cadence @xmath7-band photometric light curves instead of the spectroscopic continuum measurements presented here .",
    "the behavior of broad - line widths in response to luminosity variations has important ramifications for the accuracy of single - epoch spectroscopic determinations of black hole masses .",
    "these are derived by using the agn continuum luminosity as a proxy for the blr radius and computing a virial product based on vp @xmath248 , where @xmath68 represents the slope of the radius - luminosity relationship .",
    "recent work finds @xmath249 for the full sample of reverberation - mapped agns , where @xmath250 is the agn continuum luminosity at @xmath251   @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of the broad balmer emission lines can also be used as a proxy for continuum luminosity @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of these single - epoch methods for mass estimation relies implicitly on the assumption that line width and luminosity must be anticorrelated in a given agn , such that the derived masses will not change dramatically as the luminosity varies .",
    "our results provide additional reassuring evidence that this is generally the case ; see @xcite and @xcite for detailed discussion of the impact of variability on single - epoch mass determinations . if @xmath252 and the h@xmath0  luminosity scales linearly with continuum luminosity , then an agn maintaining a constant virial product would exhibit a line width - luminosity relationship having slope @xmath253 , similar to the slopes observed in mrk 40 , mrk 1511 , and ngc 4593 .",
    "however , it is important to note that this naive prediction for the slope of the h@xmath0  width - luminosity relationship is an oversimplification ; for example , observations of ngc 5548 show that it exhibits more complex behavior .",
    "the broad h@xmath0  flux in ngc 5548 does not scale linearly with continuum flux ( the  intrinsic baldwin effect  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the relationship between blr radius and continuum luminosity measured from long - term monitoring of ngc 5548 exhibits a steeper slope than the radius - luminosity relationship for the reverberation - mapped sample as a whole @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out line width measurements for a sample of 60 quasars having at least six epochs of sdss spectroscopy , and they examined the correlation between line fwhm and luminosity for , , h@xmath0 , and h@xmath15 . interestingly , 75% of their sources show a positive correlation between broad - line width and luminosity , and only three sources exhibited an anticorrelation at the @xmath254 confidence level .",
    "another example of a positive width - luminosity correlation for the balmer lines was recently found in pg 1613 + 658 @xcite , using data from the wise observatory quasar monitoring campaign @xcite .",
    "this behavior is very different from that seen in our sample , and is inconsistent with expectations from the scenario of blr breathing determined by radial gradients in responsivity ( with higher responsivity at larger radius ) as described above .",
    "it will be interesting to examine this trend for larger samples of quasars over long time baselines as more multi - epoch spectra become available for quasars over longer time baselines .",
    "if broad - line widths in high - luminosity quasars respond to continuum variations in a manner strongly different from what we observe in our sample of seyfert galaxies , this would potentially compromise the reliability of single - epoch black hole mass estimates derived from quasar spectra .",
    "the spectral decompositions make it possible to measure night - to - night changes in the broad h@xmath0  velocity centroids .",
    "our results for mrk 40 , mrk 50 , mrk 279 , mrk 1511 , and ngc 4593 illustrate that systematic shifts of @xmath255 km  s@xmath2 , correlated with flux changes , are common and occur over timescales similar to the continuum variability timescale .",
    "the largest shifts are seen for ngc 4593 , in which the broad h@xmath0  centroid changed by @xmath256 km  s@xmath2  over a 30-day interval , as seen in figure [ ngc4593hbetaparams ] .",

    "the reverberation process can be described in terms of a convolution of the continuum light curve @xmath257 by a velocity - dependent transfer function ,    @xmath258    where the transfer function @xmath259 is a function of line - of - sight velocity @xmath260 and of time delay @xmath261 , and @xmath262 gives the resulting time - dependent emission - line profile @xcite .",
    "if blr clouds are in circular orbits around the black hole , as in a circular keplerian disk , then the transfer function will show short lags at high velocities on both the blueshifted and redshifted sides of the line profile , and at small line - of - sight velocities there will be a broad distribution of lag time .",
    "if the blr gas is dominated by radial motions , however , the transfer function will be strongly asymmetric about the line center .",
    "for example , in a blr dominated by radial inflow , the redshifted gas on the near side of the blr will have near - zero lag , while the blueshifted gas on the far side of the blr will have the longest lags .",
    "representative transfer functions for simple kinematic models are shown by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "in addition to the imprint of blr kinematics on the transfer function , the transverse doppler shift and gravitational redshift in the blr will produce redward asymmetries in the transfer function , particularly in the high - velocity wings @xcite .",
    "the combination of transverse doppler shift and gravitational redshift , together with any radial motions , should ensure that all transfer functions are at least modestly asymmetric in structure even if the blr cloud motions are predominantly rotational .",
    "absorption or scattering within the blr may also alter the shape of @xmath259 in an asymmetric fashion .    with the best - quality reverberation - mapping data obtained over the past several years , it has become possible to examine the velocity - dependent structure of the transfer function in several low - redshift agns by measuring the lag as a function of velocity across the line profile @xcite , and by reconstructing the full two - dimensional shape of the transfer function @xcite .",
    "dynamical modeling of reverberation data has also begun to yield constraints on the transfer function shape @xcite .",
    "a primary result that has emerged from these investigations is that the h@xmath0  transfer functions for nearby seyfert galaxies exhibit a broad diversity of structures : some objects have nearly symmetric transfer functions consistent with expectations for a keplerian disk , while others have strong asymmetries suggestive of inflowing or outflowing motions .    as an illustration of why an asymmetric transfer function will lead to broad - line velocity centroid changes ,",
    "consider a radially inflowing blr .",
    "if the continuum luminosity increases , the prompt red - wing response will shift the line centroid redward initially until the blue wing response from gas on the far side of the blr is seen at a later date .",
    "similarly , a decrease in continuum luminosity will initially shift the line centroid blueward .",
    "the opposite behavior would be seen in an outflowing blr .",
    "line centroid variability will depend on the continuum light curve shape and variability amplitude , the broad - line width , and the degree of asymmetry in the transfer function . for a specified transfer function ,",
    "the direction of line profile shifts will depend on the recent gradient in the continuum light curve rather than on the absolute luminosity of the continuum .",
    "either blueshifts or redshifts can occur at a given continuum flux level , depending on the recent history of continuum variations .",

    "if one member of a binary black hole is active and possesses a broad - line region , then the orbital motion of the binary will cause the broad emission lines to oscillate in velocity over an orbital period . a substantial amount of effort",
    "has been invested recently in searching for broad - line velocity changes in quasars having two or more epochs of spectroscopic observations .",
    "one strategy is to search for objects having very large broad - line velocity offsets ( i.e. , @xmath263 km  s@xmath2  relative to the host galaxy ) , and then obtain follow - up spectroscopy to check whether the broad - line velocity drifts over time in a manner consistent with expectations for orbital motion @xcite .",
    "an alternate method is to start with the general quasar population , rather than restricting to objects showing strong velocity offsets initially , and to search for changes in broad - line centroid velocity between two widely separated epochs of spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "the discussion in this section is primarily ( but not exclusively ) relevant to this latter method .",
    "such searches are still in their initial stages . in recent searches using sdss data , @xcite examined h@xmath0  velocity shifts in a sample of 1347 quasars having two or more epochs of spectroscopy , finding 28 objects with significant velocity shifts ( of typically @xmath264 km  s@xmath2 ) and identifying seven of these as being promising candidate binaries .",
    "@xcite carried out a similar search using , finding seven candidate sub - pc binaries with velocity changes of @xmath265 km  s@xmath2  from a starting sample of 1523 quasars having spectroscopy with s / n @xmath266 at two epochs .",
    "for these candidates , continuing long - duration follow - up spectroscopy will be required in order to rule out alternative explanations and conclusively demonstrate binary motion .    in discussion of these search efforts",
    ", it is generally recognized that broad - line velocity changes can happen as a result of structural changes in the blr occurring over a dynamical timescale ( years to decades ) or longer @xcite , and such changes have been seen in multi - year monitoring observations of ngc 5548 , for example @xcite . the appearance or fading of hotspots in the blr has also been suggested as a possible mechanism to induce line profile changes and apparent velocity shifts @xcite . however , asymmetric reverberation seems to have been overlooked as a possible cause of the detected velocity shifts in these binary black hole searches .",
    "our data provide a clear demonstration that broad - line velocity centroids can vary significantly on short timescales solely as a result of reverberation , and do not provide direct evidence for bulk acceleration of the blr .    based on our small sample of nearby , low- to moderate - luminosity agns , it is difficult to extrapolate our results to make any useful predictions for the distribution of broad - line velocity shifts expected as a function of timescale for quasar surveys .",
    "we have carried out simple simulations using asymmetric transfer functions similar to those observed in arp 151 @xcite or ngc 5548 @xcite and find that velocity shifts of @xmath267 km  s@xmath2  can occasionally occur for plausible agn variability amplitudes .",
    "however , the range of transfer function shapes and asymmetries is completely unknown for the quasar population . for a given agn variability model and transfer function model",
    ", it would be straightforward to predict the expected distribution of velocity changes as a function of timescale , but such an effort is beyond the scope of this paper .    here ,",
    "our goal is simply to call attention to the fact that reverberation does indeed produce significant velocity shifts on short timescales as a result of the blr response to continuum fluctuations .",
    "this has been understood since the earliest reverberation mapping studies , and our spectral decompositions provide a way to examine broad h@xmath0  velocity shifts in seyfert 1 nuclei with high - cadence sampling over a 2.5-month baseline .",
    "considering that we find one object showing a velocity change of @xmath268 km  s@xmath2  in our small sample over this brief monitoring duration , it seems entirely plausible that , in large agn samples observed over long time baselines , the tail of the distribution of reverberation - induced velocity shifts could extend to substantially larger velocities than the values we observe here .",
    "it is difficult to exclude the possibility that most or all of the recently identified candidate binaries might simply be exhibiting velocity changes due to this relatively prosaic effect , rather than exhibiting acceleration due to binary orbital motion . in large samples of quasars with two - epoch spectroscopy , selection of targets with the largest velocity shifts will preferentially select objects from the tail of the distribution of large reverberation - induced velocity shifts , and we suggest that the majority of candidate binaries selected via this method will most likely be false positives .",
    "this reverberation effect will also contribute random velocity noise or jitter that could impede the detection of genuine binaries ( particularly wide - separation or nearly face - on binaries ) , rather analogous to the impact of stellar activity on the detectability of exoplanets via the radial - velocity method .",
    "furthermore , the radial - velocity curve for ngc 4593 ( figure [ ngc4593hbetaparams ] ) illustrates another potential concern . in this case",
    ", the velocity curve could be mistaken for a near - complete cycle of sinusoidal oscillation , when in reality the line centroid is simply responding to a down - and - up variation in the continuum luminosity . in order to convincingly demonstrate binary orbital motion and rule out reverberating impostors similar to this example",
    ", it will be necessary to monitor broad - line velocity variations over at least two orbital cycles , with sufficient cadence to sample the orbit well , and also to demonstrate that the velocity variations are uncorrelated with continuum flux variations .",
    "the expected orbital periods for quasars hosting supermassive black hole binaries span years to decades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus confirmation of black hole binaries by this method will require a very long - term effort .",
    "we present spectroscopic data , light curves , and other measurements from a 69-night reverberation mapping campaign carried out at the lick 3  m telescope in spring 2011 for a sample of 15 low - redshift seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "although our observing run was hampered by worse - than - average weather , we obtained data of excellent quality for a subset of our sample , suitable for measurement of light curves for multiple emission lines .",
    "our primary results can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "expanding on our team s recent work , we have carried out multicomponent decompositions of the nightly blue - side spectra from our campaign . the decompositions enable measurement of light curves for blended features including and , and measurements of h@xmath0  light curves and widths",
    "are improved by deblending h@xmath0  from other contaminating emission - line and continuum components .",
    "obtaining a time series of h@xmath0  line profiles without contamination from other overlapping features is also important for measurement of velocity - resolved reverberation signals and transfer functions , and for application of dynamical modeling methods to derive black hole masses @xcite . in appendix [",
    "appendix : biases ] below , we demonstrate that fitting and removal of continuum components prior to constructing the rms spectrum is also necessary in order to avoid a potentially severe bias that can occur when measuring line widths from the rms spectrum .",
    "spectral decompositions should be carried out as a routine part of reverberation mapping data analysis , provided that the s / n of the data is sufficient for multicomponent fits to yield useful results .",
    "2 .   general variability properties for our sample are consistent with trends seen in previous reverberation - mapping programs , including higher responsivity for the higher - order balmer lines , and very high responsivity for .",
    "while cross - correlation lags can be measured between the emission - line and continuum light curves presented here , lags measured against @xmath7-band photometric light curves will have better reliability as a result of the higher s / n of the photometric data and the absence of correlated flux - calibration errors between the photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "the anticorrelation between broad - line width and flux observed in four objects demonstrates that the blr `` breathes '' ( i.e. , the emissivity - weighted blr radius increases as a function of agn luminosity ) even on short timescales of days to weeks in response to continuum variations .",
    "this implies that reverberation transfer functions will be nonstationary even during the course of a single monitoring campaign .",
    "this breathing effect is responsible for the relationship between broad - line profile widths measured in mean and rms spectra , as we illustrate by means of simulations in appendix [ appendix : widthsimulations ] .",

    "we observe a broad h@xmath0  velocity shift of @xmath1 km  s@xmath2  over the course of one month , and other agns in our sample exhibit h@xmath0  velocity shifts of order 100 km  s@xmath2  over similar timescales .",
    "such velocity shifts caused by asymmetric reverberation represent an important source of confusion noise for binary black hole searches based on multi - epoch quasar spectroscopy .",
    "when only two ( or a few ) observations of a given agn are available , line - profile centroid shifts due to velocity - dependent reverberation can mimic the expected acceleration signature of binary orbital motion , producing a spurious identification of a candidate binary .",
    "typical velocity changes caused by asymmetric reverberation will be up to a few hundred km  s@xmath2 , similar to the velocity shifts detected in many of the recently identified candidate binaries @xcite .",
    "in general , reverberation will produce a velocity - jitter noise floor that could limit the detectability of binary black holes in spectroscopic searches for radial - velocity oscillations .",
    "additional papers in this series will present @xmath7-band photometric light curves , measurements of broad - line lags and velocity - resolved reverberation using both cross - correlation and javelin @xcite methodology , black hole virial mass estimates , and blr dynamical modeling using the methods described by @xcite and @xcite . following the completion of this program ,",

    "we include in the following sections a description of simulations which may be helpful in clarifying certain aspects of the behavior of the rms profile in time - series spectroscopy of agns .",
    "we first examine the relationship between broad - line profile widths in mean and rms spectra .",
    "the mean line profile gives a useful representative view of the typical emission - line width during an observational campaign .",
    "however , the mean profile incorporates the complex and nonlinear response of the line profile to continuum variations ( including profile width variations and centroid shifts as well as flux variations , as illustrated in section [ sec : widthsandcentroids ] ) , so it is not identical to the single - epoch profile that would be observed when the agn is at its mean flux .",
    "the interpretation of the rms spectrum is less straightforward .",
    "it is sometimes stated that the rms spectrum represents the variable portion of an emission line , because nonvarying components do not contribute to the rms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the blr is not composed of distinct variable and nonvariable components ; rather , different regions of the blr have different responsivities to continuum variations , and the rms spectrum does not correspond directly to the spectrum emitted by any specific physical subcomponent of the blr .",
    "essentially , the rms spectrum is useful as a tool for visualization of the relative degree of variability as a function of wavelength across the line profile , due to spatial gradients in emission - line responsivity across the blr combined with the effects of light - travel time across the blr , but it is not obvious how to interpret the physical meaning of the velocity width of an rms line profile . since reverberation - mapping campaigns are unable to acquire continuously sampled observations as an agn varies , the detailed shape of both the mean and rms spectra depends additionally on the observational sampling pattern used during the campaign .",
    "finally , continuum variability and noise in the data will have an impact on the line profiles and widths measured from rms spectra ; we examine these effects in appendix [ appendix : biases ] below .",
    "the width of broad h@xmath0  is typically found to be slightly narrower in rms profiles than in mean profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this ratio ranges from 0.43 to 1.06 , with a mean value of 0.85 and a standard deviation of 0.15 among these 17 measurements .",
    "similarly , in the sample of 15 agns examined by @xcite , the average value of the ratio @xmath270 for the broad h@xmath0  line is 0.87 .",
    "the narrower widths of rms profiles for h@xmath0  can be understood as a consequence of high - ionization gas in the inner blr having a lower responsivity to continuum variations than low - ionization gas more distant from the black hole ; @xcite predict a factor of @xmath271 change in h@xmath0  responsivity across the radial range of the blr .",
    "the high - velocity wings of the line profile are emitted primarily by low - responsivity portions of the blr , while higher - responsivity gas contributes mainly to the line core . as a result",
    ", the core of the h@xmath0  profile varies more strongly than the wings , making the rms profile narrower than the mean profile .",
    "why is it that @xmath270 typically takes the value @xmath272 ?",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to illustrate by means of simple numerical simulations that this ratio is dictated by the relationship between the broad h@xmath0  single - epoch luminosity and line width ( as described in section [ sec : linewidths ] ) , which is fundamentally a consequence of the variation in emission - line responsivity across the blr .",

    ", the details of the light curve construction have little or no effect on the ratio of rms profile width to mean profile width .",
    "then , we generate a time series of line profiles in which both the line luminosity and its width vary in response to continuum fluctuations . assuming a delta function with lag @xmath261 for the velocity - integrated transfer function , at each time @xmath273 the integrated luminosity @xmath274 of the emission line is made to scale linearly with the input continuum light curve luminosity at time @xmath275 .",
    "the width of the gaussian profile is also made to vary , such that the product @xmath276 remains constant as the line luminosity varies .",
    "this represents the most common behavior seen in our sample [ i.e. , @xmath58(h@xmath0)@xmath277(h@xmath0)@xmath278 , and corresponds to a situation in which the single - epoch virial product remains roughly constant as the agn luminosity varies . from the time series of resultant line profiles",
    ", we construct the mean and rms profiles and calculate @xmath193  for each .",
    "the result of this experiment is surprisingly simple . in the mean spectrum",
    ", the emission line has a profile that is very nearly gaussian .",
    "as expected for a broad line showing higher variability amplitude in the core than in the wings , the rms profile is narrower than the mean profile .",
    "the rms profile has an approximately gaussian shape , but exhibits additional structure in the faint high - velocity wings , and this profile shape is nearly independent of the input light curve properties .",
    "the peak height of the rms profile depends on the variability amplitude of the light curve , while its width is only very weakly dependent on variability amplitude . in the limit of small but nonzero light curve variance , the ratio @xmath270 converges to 0.824 . as the light curve variance",
    "is increased , we find that this ratio becomes very slightly sensitive to the input light curve properties .",
    "for example , when the input light curve is scaled to have @xmath279 , the simulations produce a result of @xmath280 , where the uncertainty represents the standard deviation of values from 1000 simulations carried out with different random light curves .",
    "figure [ rmssimulation ] shows an example of a mean and rms profile obtained from one such simulation with @xmath279 over a light curve having 500 equally spaced points , with a fluctuation power spectrum of the form @xmath281 ( where @xmath282 is the temporal frequency of fluctuations ) .",
    "the rms profile shape would appear virtually identical for different choices of light curve duration or sampling , power spectrum slope , or variability amplitude , although its absolute normalization depends on @xmath171 .",
    "these simulations produce a ratio @xmath270 that is remarkably close to the observed mean ratio of @xmath283 found from our lick observatory monitoring campaigns . in other words ,",
    "the typical ratio of line widths observed in rms and mean line profiles simply reflects the fact that in most agns , the broad h@xmath0  line maintains a roughly constant value of the product @xmath284 as the agn luminosity varies .",
    "the larger dispersion of values observed in real agns most likely results from the range of different ( non - gaussian ) profile shapes in different agns , and also differences in the scaling relationship between single - epoch luminosity and profile width .",
    "changing the power - law relationship between line width and luminosity does alter the width of the rms profile relative to the mean profile .",
    "for example , if we calculate models for a flatter single - epoch scaling relationship of @xmath285 ( as observed in mrk 50 ) , the simulations yield @xmath58(rms)@xmath286(mean ) @xmath287 .",
    "the prevailing use of rms profile widths as the basis for calibrating the agn black hole mass scale underscores the need for further work to understand the rms spectrum by means of of detailed simulations of blr line profiles incorporating blr dynamics and photoionization physics , including luminosity - dependent changes in emission - line responsivity @xcite . the dynamical modeling approach for interpretation of reverberation - mapping data",
    "@xcite avoids the problem of relying on simplistic measures of line width from either mean or rms spectra , and can provide more direct constraints on black hole masses . for future development of these models",
    ", it should be a high priority to incorporate a spatially variable and luminosity - dependent emission - line responsivity based on photoionization modeling of blr structure , in order to more accurately model an observed time series of variable line profiles .",
    "if the responsivity is assumed to be spatially and/or temporally constant across the blr , it will not generally be possible for these models to replicate the observed anticorrelation between line width and luminosity , or the relationship between mean and rms profile widths .",
    "since line widths measured from rms spectra are used to derive black hole masses , it is useful to examine possible sources of systematic error in these measurements .",
    "the rms spectrum blends information about emission - line variations , continuum variations , and random noise in the data , and it can deviate substantially from the `` ideal '' rms spectrum that would be derived if a single broad emission line could be observed without contamination from other spectral components or noise . in this appendix , we describe simulations designed to examine the impact of continuum variability and photon - counting noise on line widths measured from rms spectra .",
    "this same simulation methodology described above allows us to examine a potential source of bias in the rms profile width that can occur when the rms spectrum is constructed from a set of spectra that have not had the variable agn continuum removed .",
    "components of constant flux , such as narrow emission lines or starlight , do not contribute to the rms spectrum except to the extent that they show some night - to - night variations due to seeing differences , miscentering of the agn in the slit , random wavelength or flux calibration errors , or poisson noise .",
    "however , it is not widely appreciated that the variable agn continuum underlying an emission line can affect the shape of the rms profile of the line , and that this can potentially introduce significant biases into black hole virial masses determined from rms profile widths .",
    "the reason this bias occurs is that the continuum and emission - line variations are out of phase with one another : there will be portions of the light curves where the continuum is rising while the emission - line flux is falling , and vice versa .",
    "this out - of - phase variability alters the rms amplitude of the _ total _",
    "( line plus continuum ) flux , and tends to preferentially suppress the rms flux in the line profile wings relative to the line core .",
    "consequently , the rms profile constructed from total - flux spectra can sometimes have a significantly different width than it would if the emission line could be observed in isolation without continuum contamination .",
    "even a modest bias in determining the rms profile width can have a substantial and deleterious effect on the derivation of black hole masses , because black hole mass scales as the square of the line width .",
    "the typically employed procedure of fitting and subtracting the continuum from the total - flux rms spectrum prior to measuring the profile width does not alleviate this problem .    to quantify this bias",
    ", we carried out simulations using gaussian line profiles as described above .",
    "as before , the total line luminosity responds linearly to continuum variations , and the line luminosity and width vary such that @xmath276 remains constant . for the input light curves",
    ", we assumed a fluctuation power spectrum of the form @xmath281 , similar to the properties of nearby agns monitored by the _",
    "mission @xcite , and we carried out simulations with light curves of varying duration and various values of @xmath171 . the velocity - integrated transfer function was assumed to be a delta function at a lag of 10 days .",
    "the emission line was set to have a mean equivalent width of 120   relative to the mean agn continuum flux density ( typical for the broad h@xmath0  lines in our sample ) and an initial width of @xmath288 km  s@xmath2 , and the continuum flux level was assumed to be flat over the wavelength range of interest .",
    "spectra were constructed for velocity bins of 60 km s@xmath2 , corresponding closely to the 1   wavelength bins of the kast blue - side data .",
    "these simulations do not include the effects of photon - counting noise , random wavelength or flux calibration errors , contributions of narrow - line or host - galaxy components to the spectra , or nonuniform sampling cadence , all of which can further alter the rms spectrum .",
    "( the impact of photon - counting noise is described in the next section . )",
    "starting from each simulated continuum light curve , we generated a time series of emission - line profiles .",
    "at each time step , we created a spectrum of the emission line alone , and a total - flux spectrum including both the line and the continuum .",
    "two versions of the rms spectrum were then computed from the time series of line - only and total - flux spectra .",
    "then , the line dispersion @xmath193  was measured from each of these . for the total - flux rms spectrum",
    ", the surrounding continuum level was removed prior to measuring the line dispersion by subtracting the minimum value of the rms spectrum . in order to minimize the impact of rms flux in the very distant high - velocity line wings on the @xmath193  measurements , the dispersion was measured only over the wavelength range between the two minima on either side of the profile , in cases where the rms profile exhibited local minima straddling the line profile . similarly ,",
    "for the line - only rms spectrum we also measured the dispersion only over the wavelength range between the two local minima that occur in the profile wings . in real data , these very shallow minima would most likely not be visible as a result of the additional contributions to the continuum level of the rms spectra from other noise sources , and the rms profile width would be measured over some visually defined wavelength range corresponding roughly to the full width at zero intensity of the rms profile .",
    "the simulations show that the width of the total - flux rms line profile can often deviate very substantially from the width of the line - only rms profile , particularly when the monitoring duration is only a few times longer than the emission - line lag .",
    "figure [ biasedrmsprofile ] ( left panel ) shows an example of one simulation , with a 50-day spectroscopic monitoring duration ( i.e. , 5 times longer than the lag , and assuming nightly observations with no gaps ) .",
    "the figure illustrates both the line - only rms profile , which should be considered the `` true '' rms profile for this simulation , and the total - flux ( line plus continuum ) rms profile . by subtracting the continuum level from the total - flux rms spectrum and rescaling it to match the peak of the true rms profile , it is immediately apparent that the total - flux rms profile is much narrower than the true profile . in this instance , @xmath289 , which would bias the inferred black hole mass by a factor of @xmath290 .    to examine the distribution of this bias factor",
    ", we carried out a set of these simulations for campaigns of duration 30 , 50 , and 100 days , assuming nightly sampling in each case and a fixed value of @xmath291 for the agn continuum . in figure [ biasedrmsprofile ]",
    "( right panel ) , we plot the distribution of the ratio @xmath292 determined from a set of @xmath199 simulations at each campaign duration .",
    "the bias distribution is a strong function of campaign duration .",
    "for example , we find that the percentage of simulations returning @xmath293 is 22% , 6% , and 0.3% for campaign durations of 30 , 50 , and 100 days , respectively . in most of the recent large reverberation - mapping programs carried out by our team and others ,",
    "the monitoring duration is usually at least @xmath271 times longer than the measured h@xmath0  lags of the targets , but as future programs push toward higher - luminosity agns at higher redshifts there may be increasing numbers of agns for which the spectroscopic time series is sampled less intensively , over a monitoring duration that might be just barely sufficient to measure the lag ( typically about @xmath294 times the lag ) .",
    "in that situation , the total - flux rms spectrum can frequently give a misleading measure of the emission - line width .",
    "in actual reverberation data sets , the magnitude of this bias will depend on the details of the light curve shape and variability amplitude , the transfer function shape , the profile shape and equivalent width of the emission line , and the sampling cadence of the observations , so the outcome will be different for every time series of data for every agn .",
    "our intention is not to carry out exhaustive simulations for a broad range of agn parameters , but simply to demonstrate that this bias can occur under typical circumstances of a reverberation measurement when the total - flux rms spectrum is used .",
    "the simulation results shown in figure [ biasedrmsprofile ] illustrate that @xmath193  can sometimes be severely underestimated even when the light curves have sufficient duration and sampling that the emission - line lag could easily be measured accurately .",
    "we propose that the best way to avoid this problem is to carry out continuum fitting and subtraction _ prior to _ construction of the rms spectrum , so that line widths can be measured from an rms spectrum that is free of continuum variability contamination .",
    "other advantages of carrying out spectral decompositions for measurement of h@xmath0  rms profile widths have been discussed by @xcite ; they focused on the importance of removing , , narrow - line components , and starlight prior to constructing rms spectra , but they did not remove the nonstellar featureless continuum .",
    "figure [ mrk40rmscomparison ] illustrates the construction of an rms spectrum for the broad h@xmath0  line in isolation , with other emission - line and continuum components removed , and in this paper we have measured the profile widths from rms spectra constructed in this way .",
    "it is still necessary to carry out a local continuum subtraction by fitting a linear continuum model to the rms flux on either side of the h@xmath0  line in order to remove the small residual rms flux level due to random noise in the data . for the case of mrk 40 illustrated in figure [ mrk40rmscomparison ] , the values of @xmath193  for the total - flux rms spectrum and the line - only rms spectrum differ by just 2% . based on our simulations ,",
    "only a very small difference would be expected given that the campaign duration was @xmath295 times longer than the h@xmath0  lag of @xmath296 days for this agn @xcite .",
    "the finite s / n of spectroscopic observations is the source of a different bias that can afflict profile widths in rms spectra .",
    "the pixel values in an rms spectrum are determined not just by variability in the agn , but also by the noise level in the spectra .",
    "a nonvarying object would still be observed to have a nonzero rms spectrum due to photon - counting noise and detector noise .",
    "the contribution of these noise sources can affect the profile width in the rms spectrum simply because the flux density is largest in the core of the emission line , hence the noise level will be highest there as well .",
    "the larger contribution of noise in the line core will elevate the peak of the line profile in the rms spectrum relative to the wings , making the line slightly narrower than it would appear in the absence of noise .",
    "while this is not a large effect , its impact is amplified because virial masses scale as the square of the line width .    to examine the impact of s / n on rms profile widths",
    ", we carried out further simulations using the same methodology described above .",
    "continuum light curves and the resulting time series of line profiles were created using the same prescriptions and parameters described in the previous section .",
    "the continuum and emission - line spectra for each simulation epoch were added to give the total flux spectrum at each epoch .",
    "then , gaussian random noise was added to each spectrum in the time series .",
    "the gaussian dispersion for this pixel - to - pixel noise level was set by fixing the continuum s / n to a given value , and scaling the noise level by @xmath297 , where @xmath298 is the flux density at pixel @xmath197 in the spectrum .",
    "each simulation was run for a total spectroscopic monitoring duration of 100 days with nightly sampling , an emission - line lag of 10 days , and a specified value of @xmath171  for the continuum variability amplitude .    from each simulation",
    ", we computed a `` true '' rms spectrum from the time series of noise - free emission - line spectra only , with no continuum contributions .",
    "using the noise - added data , we subtracted the continuum flux level from each nightly spectrum and constructed a line - only rms spectrum that included the noise contribution .",
    "the line dispersion of the true rms profile was measured as described previously , by including the flux only between the two local minima on either side of the rms profile . to measure",
    "the width of the noise - added rms profile , we fit and subtracted the flat noise continuum using a straight - line fit , and then calculated the line dispersion over the same velocity range that was used for the true rms profile measurement .",
    "the ratio of the noise - added rms line width to the true rms line width gives the bias factor , @xmath58(noise - added)/@xmath58(noise - free ) .",
    "since the continuum flux was subtracted from each noise - added spectrum prior to constructing the noise - added rms spectrum , this measurement is immune to the continuum - variability bias described in the previous section .",
    "the degree of bias in the rms profile width depends primarily on @xmath171  and on the s / n of the data .",
    "we carried out simulations for continuum s / n ranging from 20 to 100 ( in increments of 2 ) and for @xmath171  ranging from 0.05 to 0.30 ( in increments of 0.01 ) .",
    "for each set of these parameters , we carried out 1000 simulation trials and determined the median bias factor .",
    "figure [ snbiasfigure ] displays the results , illustrating the ratio @xmath58(noise - added)@xmath286(noise - free ) as a function of @xmath171  and the continuum s / n .",
    "we also display the bias in the virial product , vp(noise - added)/vp(noise - free ) = @xmath299(noise - added)@xmath286(noise - free)@xmath300 ^ 2 $ ] . for typical parameters of a successful reverberation measurement , corresponding to @xmath301 and s / n of 30100 per pixel , the rms profile width is biased low by @xmath302 , and virial products are biased low by @xmath303 .",
    "the bias vanishes in the limit of high s / n and high variability amplitude , but even at s / n=100 per pixel the virial products are biased low by @xmath304 . unlike the continuum - variability bias described in the previous section , this effect is not alleviated by having a long and well - sampled campaign with a large number of observations . for given values of s / n and @xmath171 , increasing the number of spectra in the time series will not remove this systematic effect of photon - counting noise on the rms profile width , although it will make the rms spectrum less noisy .",
    "given the data quality for typical reverberation campaigns , these simulations suggest that virial products calculated using rms spectrum profile widths will be systematically low typically by @xmath80 .",
    "the standard practice of normalizing reverberation - based black hole masses to the local @xmath305  relation of inactive galaxies @xcite will compensate for this offset , and consequently the the virial @xmath61-factor derived from this procedure ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will be biased high by @xmath80 .",
    "the impact of this effect is much smaller than the overall uncertainty on the mean @xmath61 factor for the set of reverberation - mapped agns , so this does not currently represent a major problem for derivation of agn black hole masses , but nevertheless it is a real effect that is present in all reverberation - mapping data .",
    "@xcite presented a maximum - likelihood method to calculate rms spectra that was designed to be immune to this problem ; further tests of this or other alternative methods to calculate rms spectra would be worthwhile ."
