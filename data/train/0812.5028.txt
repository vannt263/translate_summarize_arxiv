    "the problem of fermionic pairing and superfluidity with mismatched fermi surfaces has been widely investigated in recent years from theoretical standpoints @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite .    a mismatch in fermi surfaces can be easily realized in a two - species fermionic system where the pairing species have unequal populations or different masses/ chemical potentials .",
    "typically , such a system would consist of two different fermionic atoms ( e.g. , @xmath0li and @xmath1k ) or alternatively , two hyperfine states of the same atom ( e.g. , states @xmath2 and @xmath3 of @xmath0li atoms ) .",
    "several phases have been proposed to describe the possible ground state of such a system , including the fflo phase @xcite(pairing with non - zero centre - of - mass momentum , where the order parameter shows a spatial variation ) , the gapless bp ( breached pair ) phase @xcite ( pairing with zero centre - of mass momentum : where the order parameter is non zero but the excitation energy becomes zero ) , and the inhomogeneous phase - separated state @xcite , where any two pure states coexist .    in this note ,",
    "our focus is on the homogeneous and gapless breached pair state , also known as the sarma state .",
    "sarma @xcite , in the early studies of superconductivity , predicted a spatially isotropic , homogenous and uniform state with gapless excitation modes in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "however , for weak coupling bcs theory , this gapless breached pair state marks the maximum of the thermodynamic potential , and thus , can not be the stable ground state of the system .",
    "this is the well - known sarma instability . in the last few years",
    ", several mechanisms were put forward to avoid this instability . according to forbes",
    "@xcite , a stable sarma state is possible in a model with finite range interaction where the momentum dependence of the pairing gap cures the instability .",
    "it has also been proposed by a number of workers @xcite that the breached pair state becomes stable in the deep bec regime , if the bcs - bec crossover picture is taken into account .",
    "he et al.,in a very recent work @xcite has argued that the breached pair state can be a possible ground state in the weak coupling region for a two - band fermi system .",
    "+ to study the breached pair state , we start with a two - species fermionic system . in addition to the weak bcs attraction ( denoted by @xmath4 ) , we consider a strong interaction ( @xmath5 ) of the feshbach variety which couples a fermion of type @xmath6 with a @xmath7 fermion to form a bosonic molecule @xmath8 .",
    "our model resembles the one used in @xcite , but we extend it to cover the two - species case .",
    "the system is described by the hamiltonian :    @xmath9\\ ] ]    here @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the creation and annihilation operators for atom @xmath6 , while @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the corresponding operators for atom @xmath7 . also , @xmath14 = @xmath15 and @xmath16 = @xmath17 , while @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the respective kinetic energies and @xmath20 , @xmath21 the respective chemical potentials for species @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the annihilation and creation operators for the composite boson @xmath8 are @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( we restrict ourselves to the case where only zero - momentum bosons are formed).the chemical potential for the bosons is @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the threshold energy of the composite bose particle energy band . + using this hamiltonian , we study the effect of the feshbach parameters first on the gapped bcs superfluid state , and then on the gapless sarma state , taking a variational approach .",
    "the stability of such a gapless state is analysed ensuring the positivity of the superfluid density @xcite . considering the bcs - bec crossover picture ,",
    "we show that the breached pair state is stable only in a narrow region in the bec side , bounded by two magnetic field values .",
    "we want to study the ground state of the two - fermion system by a variational method .",
    "we take @xmath26 as the trial form of the ground state of the system . here",
    "= @xmath28 = @xmath29 , i.e , the probability of the pair ( @xmath30 , @xmath31)being occupied is @xmath32 , and the probability that it is unoccupied is @xmath33 , while @xmath34 is the ground state for the condensate part of the boson subsystem .",
    "our variational prescription is that @xmath34 has to be chosen in such a manner that it is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator b , which would make it a coherent state . in terms of fock states",
    "@xmath34 = @xmath35 . using the normalization condition",
    ", we arrive at @xmath36 .",
    "the ground state of the system is consequently given by @xmath37 , @xmath38 being the expectation value of the total number of bosons in the condensed state .    from the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) and the ground state wave function ( [ grnd ] ) , the ground state energy of the system would be    @xmath39    minimizing @xmath40 with respect to @xmath41 and @xmath42 we get    @xmath43    where @xmath44 .",
    "+ @xmath45 is defined by the relation @xmath46    we note that this expression matches with the one obtained by ohashi et al @xcite using diagrammatics . in order to avoid a possible ultraviolet divergence , the summation in the right hand side of equation([gap ] )",
    "has to be carried over upto a cutoff . for a metallic superconductor , this cutoff",
    "is played by @xmath47 , @xmath48 being the debye frequency . in ultracold atomic systems ,",
    "the cutoff is determined by the range of the interatomic potential .",
    "now , if we choose @xmath49 , the usual form of the gap equation follows , and we can identify @xmath50 as the gap in the excitation spectrum .",
    "a similar relation is obtained in finite temperature systems as well , if we incorporate the appropriate fermi distribution functions in the expression of the free energy . in terms of this gap parameter , @xmath51 and @xmath41",
    "can be expressed as @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "+ the critical temperature @xmath54 ( temperature at which the gap vanishes ) is proportional to @xmath55 , the bcs gap in the weak coupling limit , which is given by @xcite @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the density of states in the fermi level , @xmath58 is the base of natural logarithms , and @xmath59 is the fermi energy .",
    "thus the value of @xmath55 ( and @xmath60 ) can be raised or lowered by adjusting @xmath25 , the tunable parameter depending on the feshbach resonance process .",
    "+ next we study gapless excitations.the quasiparticle dispersions as obtained from standard bcs - like treatment is of the form @xcite : @xmath61    -@xmath62 ) curve for @xmath63 , @xmath64,title=\"fig : \" ] -@xmath62 ) curve for @xmath63 , @xmath64,title=\"fig : \" ]    -@xmath62 ) curve for @xmath63 , @xmath64,title=\"fig : \" ] -@xmath62 ) curve for @xmath63 , @xmath64,title=\"fig : \" ]    -@xmath62 ) curve for @xmath63 , @xmath64,title=\"fig : \" ] -@xmath62 ) curve for @xmath63 , @xmath64,title=\"fig : \" ]    depending on the values of particle masses and corresponding chemical potentials , these quasiparticle excitations can be negative , thus leading to gapless excitations .",
    "this is possible only if the magnitude of @xmath50 is less than a critical value @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "@xmath66    when @xmath67 , both @xmath68 and @xmath69 remain positive for all values of @xmath62 .",
    "this corresponds to usual bcs pairing .",
    "when @xmath70 , either @xmath68 or @xmath69 crosses zero at the points :    @xmath71^{1/2}\\ ] ]    the difference between @xmath72 and @xmath73 gives the span over which we get a gapless region in the parameter space .",
    "the state with gapless excitations marks the coexistence of the superfluid and normal components at zero temperature , and is called the sarma phase , or the breached pair state .",
    "when we include the feshbach term in the hamiltonian , we have a control over this sarma phase as well .    in figures(1,2,3 )",
    ", we plot the @xmath40-@xmath62 curve for a two - species system . here",
    "we scale all energies by @xmath74 ( fermi energy of species @xmath7 ) and all momenta by @xmath75 ( fermi momentum of species @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is evident that in this convention , @xmath76 and @xmath77(in the bcs limit ) .",
    "we choose @xmath78 , @xmath79 and multiply quantities @xmath80 , @xmath5 , @xmath81 and @xmath45 by @xmath57 , the density of states at the fermi level to get dimensionless quantities",
    "@xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    ". had there been no feshbach coupling @xmath5 , we would get a gapless region from @xmath62=1.01 to @xmath62=1.85 ( in units of @xmath75 ) as seen from figure-1 .",
    "+ if @xmath64 is introduced in the system , and we choose @xmath87 in such a way that @xmath88 , we get the sarma phase for a wider region , from @xmath62=1.00 to @xmath62=1.95 ( in units of @xmath75 ) as seen from figure-2 . + if , on the other hand , @xmath89 , the gapless phase vanishes entirely ( figure-3 ) . +",
    "the stability of a superfluid phase has been studied in different ways like demanding positivity of the superfluid density @xcite , ensuring non - negative eigenvalues of the number susceptibility matrix of the system@xcite , minimization of thermodynamic potential @xcite etc .    here",
    "we adopt the first criterion and demand that the superfluid density @xmath90 must be positive .",
    "if the fermions are charged , this is equivalent to saying that the meissner mass - squared must be positive @xcite , since @xmath90 , the superfluid density , and @xmath91 , the meissner mass squared obey the relation : @xmath92 @xcite , @xmath93 being the electronic charge and @xmath94 , the mass of the particle . in our treatment , we work with the superfluid density directly , since we are talking of a charge neutral fermi system .",
    "however , the term  meissner mass \" can still be used just to continue the analogy with superconductors , as it only serves to express the superfluid density to within a multiplicative constant",
    ".    for convenience , we assume that the two species have equal masses . therefore , equation ( [ p2 - 11 ] ) takes a simpler form : @xmath95}^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "thus , @xmath98 here .",
    "he et al @xcite have shown that when the two species have equal masses , the superfluid density can be expressed as @xmath99    where @xmath100 .",
    "we note that here @xmath101 marks the bare fermion density or the density of the atoms that have not been part of the condensate yet ( i.e , unpaired fermions , fermions forming the cooper pair and fermions that constitute the non - condensate bosons all are counted in n ) .",
    "since the total number of bare fermi atoms is conserved , so @xmath102= constant , @xmath38 being the expectation value of the total number of bosons in the condensate . if @xmath103 , for @xmath90 is to be positive , @xmath104 has to be less than 1 , which is satisfied if @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "+ now when both @xmath72 and @xmath73 are real and there is a breached pair phase between them ( this state has sometimes been termed as bp2 state in the literature @xcite ) , the bare fermion density can be written as : @xmath107\\ ] ] here the first term denotes the contribution from the gapless region between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , i.e , the normal component .",
    "the next two integrals take care of the contributions from the gapped superfluid regimes , one from momenta @xmath108 to @xmath72 and the other from @xmath73 to infinity .",
    "the terms , when rearranged , gives @xmath109 in the weak coupling limit , the last two integrals are very small , and hence , can be neglected .",
    "therefore , @xmath110=1 , and @xmath90 is negative .",
    "thus , the sarma state is unstable here .",
    "+   + we shift our focus to a special case , where only one of @xmath72 and @xmath73 is real ( in the literature , this is called the bp1 state @xcite ) . in this case the @xmath40-@xmath62 curve resembles figure 4 , and the bare fermion density is @xmath111 this yields @xmath112 , and thus the stability criterion is fulfilled .",
    "-@xmath62 ) curve when @xmath72 is imaginary , title=\"fig : \" ] -@xmath62 ) curve when @xmath72 is imaginary , title=\"fig : \" ]    now , from equation([p2 - 12 ] ) , @xmath72 is imaginary if @xmath113 , i.e , @xmath114 .",
    "so , sarma phase is stable only in a region where the chemical potential of one species is positive , and the other , negative , provided the magnitude of their product is greater than @xmath115 .",
    "+ leggett has shown @xcite that in the bcs - bec crossover picture , the chemical potential can be determined by solving the gap and the number equations . extending these equations to the two species case , we get    @xmath116    where @xmath117 is the @xmath118 scattering length and @xmath119 and @xmath120 correspond to the fermi wave number of the more and the less populated species respectively . let @xmath121 denote the wave number corresponding to the breaching point for the bp1 state , i.e , @xmath122 . converting the sums into integrals",
    ", we obtain that in the weak coupling limit , @xmath123 , as expected .",
    "in contrast , in the strong coupling limit , @xmath124 provided @xmath125 ( a condition which is satisfied if the population imbalance is small compared to the total population ) . in this case @xmath126",
    "asymptotically approaches @xmath127 , i.e , half the binding energy of the molecule .",
    "+ if we think of @xmath20 and @xmath21 separately , the first one differs from the other by the fermi energy of the excess fermions .",
    "moreover , in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath128 , there is an asymmetry between the chemical potentials given by @xmath129 , @xmath130 being the fermion magneton .",
    "so we have @xmath131     and @xmath21 in the crossover picture ]    therefore , @xmath132    our domain of interest is when @xmath20 is positive , and @xmath21 is negative , i.e , while approaching the bec side , @xmath21 has already crossed zero but @xmath20 has not .",
    "now , @xmath20 and @xmath21 becomes zero at magnetic field values @xmath133 and @xmath134 respectively , as sketched in figure ( 5 ) , where    @xmath135\\\\ \\label{h2 } h_2=(2/m_b)\\left [ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ma_{s2}^2}+\\frac{2\\epsilon_{b_f}(k_{b_f}a_{s2})}{3\\pi}\\left(1+\\frac{2k'^3a_{s2}^3}{\\pi}\\right ) -\\frac { \\hbar^2 k'^2}{4m}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath136 , @xmath137 are the respective values of the scattering length at @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "between these two magnetic field values , the sarma state will be stable .",
    "experiments with population - imbalanced fermionic systems have been done by zwierlein et al .",
    "@xcite and partridge et al @xcite.they obtained the signature of superfluidity in an unequal mixture of two spin states of @xmath0li atoms , and a quantum phase transition between the superfluid state and the normal state was observed at a critical polarization .",
    "another method for experimental detection of the breached pair phase has been suggested by yi et al .",
    "however , no clear signature of this gapless phase has been obtained till date .",
    "we now use the data obtained from these experiments on population - imbalanced gas of @xmath0li atoms @xcite to make an estimate of the magnetic field values corresponding to the breached pair sarma state . to be able to use the expressions ( [ h1],[h2 ] ) ,",
    "we need to know the scattering length as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "this is provided by @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the background scattering length , @xmath140 is the width of the resonance , and @xmath141 is the position of the resonance peak .",
    "we use this expression for scattering length , and put @xmath142 ( @xmath143=bohr radius ) , which is the singlet scattering length for @xmath0li .",
    "we also take @xmath144 , @xmath145 as population of the two species , @xmath141= 834 g , @xmath140= 300 g ( these values correspond to experimental data for feshbach resonances in @xmath0li as reported in @xcite . ) we now solve equations ( [ h1],[h2 ] ) explicitly to find @xmath133 to be 832.40 g and @xmath134 to be 833.95 g. it would be interesting to speculate that the superfluid observed by zwierlein et al . in this range",
    "is of the bp1 variety .",
    "this estimate of @xmath133 and @xmath134 is not a highly accurate one .",
    "in fact , the range of the breached pair state should get shifted a bit towards lower values of the magnetic field .",
    "actually , for deriving equations ( [ h1],[h2 ] ) , we had assumed the magnitudes of the chemical potentials to be very large compared to @xmath50 and @xmath146 , an assumption which does not hold at points where @xmath20 and @xmath21 become zero .",
    "however , the values are not unreasonable in view of the fact that in the bcs - bec crossover picture , the chemical potential falls quite sharply after crossing zero and quickly becomes a large negative quantity .",
    "here we have studied a two - species fermionic system in the presence of feshbach resonance , taking a variational route with an explicit construct of the ground state .",
    "the gapless breached pair state was discussed , and its stability was analysed ensuring the positivity of the superfluid density .",
    "we showed that a breached pair state with two fermi surfaces is always unstable , while its single fermi - surface counterpart is stable when the chemical potential of the two pairing species bear opposite signs .",
    "the stability of the breached pair state is indeed a widely debated issue .",
    "although it has often been suggested that the bp1 state might be stable in deep bec region , nothing , to the best of our knowledge , was said anything about how ` deep ' that really is . in this note , however , we observe that , the requirement that @xmath147 and @xmath148 should be of opposite signs , automatically puts two bounds in terms of the feshbach magnetic fields , between which the gapless state is stable . moreover ,",
    "this stable breached pair state is obtained not in deep bec , but near the vicinity of the point when the average chemical potential crosses zero , i.e , right after the onset of condensation .",
    "gubankova et al @xcite , while discussing the stability of breached pair states by analysing the number susceptibility , commented that stable gapless states with a single fermi surface exist for negative average chemical potential . in a recent paper ,",
    "a. mishra et al.@xcite reached the same conclusion by comparing the thermodynamic potentials of the condensed phase and the normal phase .",
    "although the criterion they arrive at ( the negativity of the average chemical potential ) does not fully match with ours ( the chemical potential of the two species to have opposite signs ) , there is definitely a region of overlap .    in their experiment ,",
    "zwierlein et al . observed that superfluidity breaks down when the pairing gap @xmath50 becomes small compared to the chemical potential difference @xmath149 .",
    "we note that this matches with the stability criterion for the bp2 state , since , if @xmath150 and @xmath151 , the state becomes unstable , as seen from equation ( [ m2 ] ) .    as for the bp1 state",
    ", we have shown that this state is stable in a region where @xmath20 and @xmath21 have opposite signs , which can be achieved by keeping the system between two specific magnetic field values .",
    "for simplicity we took the two species to have same masses in our calculation , but the treatment should be extendable to a situation where the fermion species are of different masses , as for example in a @xmath0li-@xmath152k system .",
