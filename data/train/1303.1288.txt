    "inference for a binomial proportion @xmath0 is one of the most commonly encountered statistical problems , with important applications in areas such as clinical trials , risk analysis and quality control .",
    "consequently , a large number of two - sided confidence intervals and one - sided confidence bounds for @xmath0 have been proposed by different authors .",
    "these are of two different types : _ exact _ methods , that have a coverage at least equal to @xmath1 for all @xmath2 , and _ approximate _ methods , that may have coverage less than @xmath1 for some values of @xmath0 , but that have a coverage that in some sense is approximately equal to @xmath1 .    research on confidence intervals and bounds for a binomial proportion has mostly focused on approximate intervals . in the methodological literature , exact intervals have often been deemed to be too conservative @xcite , as they tend to be quite wide and have actual coverage levels that often are noticeably greater than @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , the use of exact intervals for proportions is abundant among practitioners : see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for some recent examples . by far the most widely used exact interval is the clopper  pearson interval , introduced by @xcite .",
    "the benefit of using an exact interval is obvious : one does not risk that the actual coverage falls below @xmath1 .",
    "for this reason , some regulatory authorities require that exact intervals be used .",
    "moreover , the binomial distribution is unusual in that we often can be sure that it is an accurate description of that which we are modelling and not just an approximation to the true distribution , as is often the case when continuous distributions are used for modelling .",
    "in such a situation , using an exact method seems reasonable .",
    "but there are also costs associated with the use of such an interval . when choosing between approximate and exact confidence methods , there is a trade - off in that exact intervals and bounds by construction are wider than the best approximate intervals , or equivalently , require a larger sample size in order to obtain a certain expected length .",
    "if one is unwilling to accept intervals and bounds with undercoverage for some values of @xmath0 , there is a cost to pay in terms of expected length or required sample size .",
    "this paper seeks to quantify these costs .    in planned experiments ,",
    "it is always important to determine a suitable sample size .",
    "sample size determination for binomial confidence intervals has received much attention in recent years @xcite , with different authors studying different intervals and methods for sample size calculations , the latter often of a computer - intensive nature .",
    "the first main contribution of this paper is closed - form formulas for computing the sample size required for the clopper  pearson methods to obtain a given expected length .",
    "this eliminates the need for computer - intensive methods for computing sample sizes and gives a better understanding of how the desired length and the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath3 affect the sample size .",
    "the second main contribution is closed - form expressions for the excess length and increase in required sample size that comes from using the exact clopper  pearson methods instead of approximate methods .",
    "we obtain these expressions by deriving asymptotic expansions for the exact clopper  pearson methods , extending the work of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite on the asymptotics of approximate binomial confidence methods to exact intervals and bounds .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section [ methods ]",
    "we introduce the clopper  pearson methods along with other exact and approximate confidence methods . in section [ twosided ]",
    "we give an asymptotic expression for the expected length of the clopper  pearson interval .",
    "this allows us to give a formula for computing the sample size , and to determine the cost of using an exact interval rather than an approximate interval , in terms of expected length and sample size . in section [ onesided ]",
    "we discuss the one - sided clopper ",
    "pearson bound and give expressions for its expected distance to @xmath0 and the cost of using an exact bound . in section [ disc ] we discuss costs associated with approximate intervals and state some conclusions . all proofs and technical details are deferred to an appendix .",
    "the two - sided clopper  pearson interval for a proportion @xmath0 is an inversion of the equal - tailed binomial test : the interval contains all values of @xmath0 that are nt rejected by the test at confidence level @xmath3 .",
    "given an observation @xmath4 , the lower limit is thus given by the value of @xmath5 such that @xmath6 and the upper limit is given by the @xmath7 such that @xmath8    as is well - known , the computation of @xmath5 and @xmath7 is simplified by the following equality from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath9 be the density function of a @xmath10 random variable .",
    "then @xmath11 when ( [ kotz ] ) is plugged into ( [ cp1 ] ) and ( [ cp2 ] ) , the problem of finding @xmath5 and @xmath7 reduces to inverting the distribution functions of two beta distributions .",
    "consequently , the endpoints of the clopper  pearson interval are given by quantiles of beta distributions : @xmath12 when @xmath4 is either 0 or @xmath13 , closed - form expressions for the interval bounds are available .",
    "when @xmath14 the interval is @xmath15 and when @xmath16 it is @xmath17 .",
    "for other values of @xmath4 , ( [ betaapprox ] ) must be evaluated numerically .",
    "the interval is implemented in most statistical software packages ; it can for instance be found in the ` propcis ` package in r and computed using the ` proc freq ` command in sas .",
    "some authors @xcite have argued that when choosing between confidence intervals , it is often preferable to use an interval with a simple closed - form formula rather than one that requires numerical evaluation , as the former is easier to present and to interpret .",
    "next , we give asymptotic expansions of @xmath5 and @xmath7 , that function as good approximations when @xmath18 , and can be used if a closed - form formula for the clopper  pearson interval is desired . as an example , when @xmath19 the upper bound is accurate up to two decimal places for @xmath20 .",
    "[ boundapprox1 ] let @xmath21 be fixed .",
    "let @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 be the upper @xmath25 quantile of the standard normal distribution .",
    "the bounds of the clopper  pearson interval are , up to @xmath26 , @xmath27    similar in construction to the two - sided interval , the one - sided clopper ",
    "pearson bounds are obtained by inverting one - sided binomial tests .",
    "thus the @xmath1 clopper  pearson upper bound @xmath28 is given by the @xmath28 such that @xmath29 in the following , we limit our study to upper bounds . for symmetry reasons ,",
    "the results are however equally valid for lower bounds , as for the bounds under consideration , a lower bound @xmath30 for @xmath0 is equivalent to an upper bound for @xmath31 , as @xmath32 .    if a closed - form expression for @xmath28 is desired , it can be obtained in the form of an asymptotic expansion by replacing @xmath25 with @xmath3 in theorem [ boundapprox1 ] above .",
    "in much of the medical literature , as well as the rest of the present paper , the clopper  pearson interval is refered to as _ the _ exact confidence interval for a binomial proportion . despite this terminology ,",
    "several other exact intervals have been proposed throughout the years .",
    "these alternative intervals do not admit closed - form expressions and are , to varying extents , computer - intensive .",
    "there are several reasons as to why the clopper  pearson interval is the most widely used exact interval .",
    "one is simply tradition and availability : it has found its way in to classic statistical textbooks and has been implemented in almost all statistical software packages .",
    "compared to the computer - intensive alternatives , the clopper  pearson interval is also considerably simpler computationally . finally , it remains a natural choice in that it is the inversion of the well - known equal - tailed binomial test .    in the two - sided case , however , there is room for improvement , at least if one is willing to let go of some natural properties of confidence intervals .",
    "other exact intervals have been designed to be shorter than the clopper  pearson interval , by inverting two - sided tests that need not be equal - tailed . moreover",
    ", the coverage probabilities of these intervals often fluctuate less from @xmath1 than does the coverage of the clopper  pearson interval .    the blyth  still  casella interval @xcite is guaranteed to be the shortest exact interval , but has the odd property that it is not nested , in the sense that the 90 % interval need not be contained in the 95 % interval ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) .",
    "this is also true for the intervals of @xcite .    the @xcite procedure yields nested intervals that are shorter than the clopper  pearson interval , but will in some cases result in two separate intervals rather than one connected interval .",
    "@xcite proposed a nested exact interval that , while wider than the blyth  still  casella interval , always is contained in the clopper  pearson interval .",
    "it is however sometimes a union of disjoint intervals and its upper bound is decreasing but not strictly decreasing in @xmath3 when @xmath13 and @xmath4 are fixed @xcite .",
    "the interval based on the inverted exact likelihood ratio test suffers from similar problems @xcite .",
    "the clopper  pearson interval , in contrast , is nested , is always a connected set and has bounds that are strictly monotone in @xmath3 .",
    "while it is possible to obtain shorter exact confidence intervals for a binomial proportion , this seems to be associated with the loss of nestedness , connectedness or monotonicity .",
    "as we consider these properties to be of importance , we will only include the clopper  pearson interval and bounds in the following sections , and will out of convenience refer to them as _ the _ exact methods .",
    "implementations of some of the alternative exact intervals are readily available .",

    "methods for determining sample size are discussed next .",
    "several different criterions can be considered when determining sample size , as discussed e.g. by @xcite .",
    "we focus on a comparatively simple criterion : for a fixed confidence level @xmath1 we wish to find the smallest sample size @xmath13 such that the expected length of the confidence interval is some fixed value @xmath58 .",

    "ignoring the higher terms of the expansion ( [ lenexp ] ) we obtain the second - order approximation @xmath61 , which can be evaluated analytically .",
    "given an initial guess @xmath59 for @xmath0 , the equation @xmath62 has the solution @xmath63 when rounded up to the nearest integer .",

    "an alternative measure of coverage is mean coverage , which typically is taken to be the expected coverage with respect to a uniform pseudo - prior of @xmath0 . in recent papers on binomial confidence intervals ,",
    "approximate methods have often been considered to be preferable to exact methods @xcite , the argument being that it makes more sense to interpret the confidence level as the mean coverage probability rather than the minimum coverage probability , as this corresponds better to how many modern - day statisticians think of coverage levels .",
    "reasoning along the lines of @xcite , the minimum coverage can occur in an uninteresting part of the parameter space , typically close to the boundaries , possibly rendering it an uninteresting measure of coverage .",
    "this is discussed further in the next section .    as noted e.g. by @xcite ,",
    "using mean coverage is very much in line with current statistical practice in other problems .",
    "widely used methods based on boostrapping and mcmc , for instance , typically only control confidence levels and type i error rates approximately , attaining the @xmath1 level only on average .",
    "this is particularly reasonable when the model is known to be an imperfect representation of the underlying process , in which case even minimum coverage criterions are approximate at best .",
    "unlike in many other applications however , one can often be rather certain that a random variable truly is binomial .",
    "this begs the question whether one should resort to approximations or use methods that really are guaranteed to be exact .",
    "if the bayesian credible intervals based on either the jeffreys @xmath73 or the uniform @xmath75 priors are used , an additional argument for the mean coverage criterion is given by the bayesian interpretation of these intervals .",
    "if we accept mean coverage as a criterion when choosing between confidence intervals , we can obtain intervals that simultaneously admit both frequentist and objective bayesian interpretations .",
    "the minimum coverage criterion underlying the clopper  pearson interval is in line with classical statistical theory .",
    "it asserts that overcoverage is a less serious problem than undercoverage , or , in other words , that it is better to be more confident than you think that you are than to be overconfident .",
    "next , in order to evaluate this argument further , we will discuss just how overconfident one risks being when using approximate intervals .",
    "just as there are costs associated with using exact methods , there are costs associated with using approximate methods : the actual coverage level may , even for large @xmath13 , drop below the nominal @xmath1 .",
    "there is no guarantee that the true @xmath0 is not in an unfortunate area with low coverage .",
    "however , these coverage anomalies usually occur close to the boundaries of the parameter space , so unless we are interested in inference for @xmath0 close to 0 or 1 , it may therefore be more relevant to investigate the minimum over a central subset , such as @xmath136 .    the problem of undercoverage is illustrated in figure [ acost ] , in which the minimum coverages of the jeffreys , wilson and agresti  coull intervals are shown for different @xmath13 when the minimum is taken over either @xmath137 or @xmath138 . for @xmath137 and a moderately large sample size of @xmath139 ,",
    "the minimum coverage of the jeffreys interval is approximately 0.88 , whereas the minimum coverage of the wilson score interval is about 0.93 .",
    "the agresti ",
    "coull interval fares somewhat better , with a minimum coverage of 0.94 . in this",
    "setting neither the jeffreys nor the wilson score interval has a minimum coverage above 0.94 even for a sample size as large as @xmath140 .     or @xmath141 when @xmath119 , computed over a grid of 200,000 equidistant points . ]",
    "a coverage of 0.94 for a nominal 0.95 method is well below what one should expect for sample sizes as large as @xmath140 .",
    "if undercoverage of this size is unacceptable , one may apply computer - intensive coverage - adjustment method similar to those discussed in @xcite , decreasing @xmath3 to some @xmath142 for which the minimum coverage over some set of values of @xmath0 is at least @xmath1 , thus making the methods exact . decreasing @xmath3",
    "will however _ increase _ the expected length of the intervals .",
    "comparing sample sizes of the @xmath143 jeffreys interval and the @xmath1 clopper  pearson interval , we have : @xmath144 for @xmath13 between 1000 and 1500 , computer - intensive adjustments of the jeffreys interval lead to @xmath145 ( the actual @xmath142 being somewhat larger than @xmath146 ) . for @xmath68 and @xmath147 , we get @xmath148 , i.e. that the clopper  pearson interval requires 186 observations _ fewer _ to obtain the desired expected length . in general ,",
    "approximate intervals that have been adjusted to be exact are outperformed by the clopper  pearson interval .",
    "similarly , if one is willing to use approximate intervals , it is possible to apply coverage - adjustments to the clopper  pearson interval in order to adjust its mean coverage to @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting @xmath149 , meaning that the interval becomes shorter after the adjustment .",
    "@xcite studied this problem in detail for @xmath150 , showing that the adjusted clopper  pearson intervals often outperformed its competitors .",
    "it should be noted that other criterions than coverage and expected length can be used for comparing confidence intervals .",
    "@xcite compared location properties , i.e. left and right non - coverage , of intervals and found the clopper  pearson interval to have good properties in comparison to some approximate intervals . @xcite",
    "considered two criterions related to @xmath0-values , motivated by the interpretation of confidence intervals as inverted tests , and found the clopper  pearson interval to be better than its competitors .",
    "when choosing between exact and approximate confidence methods , it is important to be aware of the benefits and the costs associated with the two types of methods . the coverage fluctuations of approximate intervals have been compared in several studies , making it easy for practitioners to compare how costly these intervals can be in terms of undercoverage .",
    "we have attempted to make the costs of using exact methods explicit , by giving expressions for how much larger the expected length of the exact intervals are and for how much the sample size increases when a fixed expected length is to be attained .",
    "for the two - sided jeffreys interval , exactness comes at a fixed price : the cost of using the clopper  pearson interval instead of this intervals is , in terms of expected length and required sample size , insensitive to @xmath0 and @xmath3 . for the agresti ",
    "coull interval , the cost only depends on @xmath3 .",
    "this stands in contrast to the wilson score interval and one - sided bounds , for which @xmath0 and @xmath3 can greatly affect the cost . in either case the required sample sizes for the exact methods can be substantially larger than those of the approximate methods .    in our comparison of exact and approximate methods ,",
    "the only exact methods considered were the clopper  pearson interval and bound .",
    "while other shorter exact two - sided intervals exist , they suffer from various problems that make them unsuitable for use .",
    "moreover , the clopper  pearson interval is used far more often than the other exact intervals , which merits its role as the main subject of this study .",
    "the author would like to thank robert newcombe and silvelyn zwanzig for their many thoughtful comments on an earlier version of this paper .",
    "theorem [ boundapprox1 ] follow directly from the following lemma , which is used in the proofs of theorems [ lenthm ] and [ lenthm2 ] .",
    "the approximations are close to the actual bounds even for small sample sizes .",
    "when @xmath152 and @xmath38 is not too close to @xmath153 or @xmath154 , the approximations are typically accurate up to at least least two decimal places .      for the clopper ",
    "pearson interval @xmath30 is the beta quantile @xmath110 . when @xmath111 this can be written as @xmath156 , i.e. @xmath157 , the lower limit of the @xmath75 interval for @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "an asymptotic expression for @xmath160 in terms of @xmath161 is given in expression ( a.23 ) in @xcite .",
    "we obtain the asymptotic expansion of @xmath30 by taking the expansion for @xmath157 and rewriting the bound in terms of @xmath162 , in a manner similar to equation ( a.26 ) of @xcite .",
    "the expansion of @xmath28 is derived analogously .    using the expansion in lemma [ limlem ] , when @xmath111 @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 by theorem 7 of @xcite . as the contribution to expected length given by @xmath166 is @xmath167 , when computing @xmath60 we can disregard the fact that the above expansion is invalid for @xmath166 .",
    "the @xmath168 term is the length of the wald interval , the expectation of which was given in @xcite : @xmath169 @xmath170 is bounded when @xmath171 and @xmath172 is twice differentiable for @xmath173 .",

    "@xmath178    the proof of theorem [ lenthm2 ] is in analogue with the proof of theorem [ lenthm ] and is therefore omitted .",
