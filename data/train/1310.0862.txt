    "the present work has been motivated by the finding of a charged charmoniumlike state , named @xmath8 , in the @xmath9 process by the bes collaboration @xcite .",
    "the state is found in the pion recoil mass spectrum ( which corresponds to the @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum ) at @xmath10 mev , very close to the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "the spin - parity of @xmath8 is not known although it has been assumed to be @xmath7 in ref .",
    "its isposin is obviously 1 .",
    "interestingly , another state with very similar mass , @xmath11 has also been found in the @xmath12 mass spectrum in the @xmath13 process @xcite although it does not seem to be clear if the states found in @xmath14 and @xmath12 are the same or not .",
    "the finding of these new @xmath15 states adds to the discovery of a series of bottomoniumlike/ charmoniumlike charged states which are being reported from recent experimental studies .",
    "the special interest in these states arises from the fact that they necessarily require more than two constituent quarks to get their quantum numbers right .",
    "the existence of mesons ( baryons ) possessing more than two ( three ) constituent quarks has always been viable within qcd .",
    "however , a rigorous experimental search for such states has begun only recently , since the states made of heavy quarks are now produced with high statistics in the new @xmath16 factories .",
    "this makes it easier to look for exotic hadrons by searching for charged heavy quarkoniumlike states .    in the charm sector , several charged states have been reported by now , like @xmath17 , found in the @xmath18 system @xcite ( also reconfirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite more recently ) , @xmath19 , @xmath20 found in the @xmath21 invariant mass spectrum @xcite , @xmath22 in the @xmath23 system @xcite and now @xmath24 found in the @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath25 @xcite systems , respectively .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that the first three of these @xmath15 states have not been found by the babar collaboration @xcite .",
    "hence , some of these states still need more confirmation for their existence .",
    "but if they do exist then it is interesting to notice that the masses of all these states are relatively close to each other , while the widths of these states vary between 40 - 200 mev .",
    "curiously , all of them lie very close to the threshold of some open charm meson system .",
    "also , all the decay channels where these charged states have been found ( like , @xmath18 , @xmath21 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) can account for similar isospin - spin quantum numbers . thus , these channels , in principle , can couple to each other and it is possible that a same @xmath15 state is seen in different @xmath28 or open charm final states . in such a situation , where states with closely spaced masses and overlapping widths are being found , it is very important to make a careful analysis to judge if all of them are different or are sometimes replicas of each other .    to add to the efforts in understanding these newly found states",
    ", we make a study of the @xmath0 molecule - like current in the isospin 1 configuration using qcd sum rules and study its different spin configurations .",
    "a system of two vector mesons can possess a total spin - parity @xmath29 , @xmath7 or @xmath2 when interacting in s - wave .",
    "such configurations of two vector mesons are ideally suited to formation of moleculelike resonances as the constituent hadrons posses little energy .",
    "since the masses of some @xmath15 s are close to the threshold of open charm meson systems , some of them could be explained within such a picture . to unambiguously separate the different spin - parity configurations of the @xmath0 systems ,",
    "we apply the spin projectors discussed in our previous work @xcite on the most general current written for the system .",
    "some works have already been done on the @xmath0 system using qcd sum rules with the motivation of finding a state which can be associated to @xmath3 . in refs .",
    "@xcite a current corresponding to @xmath7 spin - parity has been studied and a state compatible with @xmath3 has been found .",
    "the authors of ref .  @xcite investigate a tetraquark current with spin - parity @xmath30 and @xmath2 to conclude that @xmath3 is a @xmath2 tetraquark state .",
    "some work has also been done with other formalisms to understand the nature of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 system has also been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite where a bound state in isospin 1 and spin - parity @xmath2 was predicted with mass between 3900 - 3965 mev and width of 160 - 200 mev",
    ". we will later compare our results with those found in these previous works and make some conclusions .",
    "we write the interpolating current corresponding to the @xmath31 molecule as @xmath32\\left[\\bar{d}_b(x ) \\gamma_\\nu c_b(x)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath33 denote the color indices . with this current",
    "we construct the two - point correlation function @xmath34 \\mid 0 \\rangle \\label{pi}\\ ] ] and then apply the spin projectors discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite to it .",
    "the @xmath29 , @xmath7 and @xmath2 components of the correlation function written in eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) can be obtained using the following projectors @xmath35 where @xmath36 is defined in terms of the metric tensor , @xmath37 , and the four momentum @xmath38 of the correlation function as @xmath39 these projectors were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by building an analogy with the work done in ref .",
    "@xcite where the s - wave @xmath40 interaction was studied using effective field theory .",
    "some of these projectors coincide with those determined in ref .",
    "@xcite , where projectors for more spin - parity cases are given . as mentioned earlier , we are interested in studying @xmath29 , @xmath7 and @xmath2 configurations of @xmath41 keeping in mind that the low energy interaction of these two mesons is dominated by s - wave scattering which is a favorable situation for formation of moleculelike states .",
    "the motivation behind separating only the positive parity components is to look for moleculelike states with mass close to the threshold of the constituent hadrons , in which case there is little energy available for the hadrons , which as a consequence interact in s - wave .",
    "a moleculelike picture for @xmath3 seems to be quite plausible since its mass is merely 8 mev away from the @xmath31 threshold . in other words , here we want to see if @xmath3 can be interpreted as a @xmath7 or @xmath2 resonance of the @xmath31 system .",
    "the @xmath29 assignment is ruled out for @xmath3 by spin - parity conservation for the @xmath9 process .",
    "however , some other @xmath15 resonance with @xmath29 might exist .",
    "as is well known , the qcd sum rules method is based on the dual nature of the correlation function : it can be interpreted as quark - antiquark fluctuations at short distances , which is usually referred to as the qcd side , while it can be related to hadrons at large distances , which is referred to as the phenomenological side . in this method , thus one calculates the correlation function within both interpretations and equates the two results with the conviction that the two sides must be equivalent in some range of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the calculation from the qcd side leads to a quark propagator form of the correlation function which is written in terms of the operator product expansion ( ope ) and the coefficients of the series are calculated perturbatively @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "one calculates the spectral density which is related to the correlation function through the dispersion relation @xmath43 proceeding with the standard scheme , then , we obtain the spectral density , corresponding to the spin - projected correlation function , by going in the ope series up to dimension six in the present case @xmath44 the different spin - projected ope results are given in the appendix of the paper .",
    "next , to make the calculations from the phenomenological side we assume , as usually done , that the spectral density can be written as a sum of a narrow , sharp state , which precisely corresponds to the one we are looking for , and a smooth continuum @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ rhopheno ] ) @xmath46 denotes the spin , @xmath47 is the squared four - momentum flowing in the correlation function , @xmath48 is the coupling of the current to the state we are interested in and @xmath49 denotes its mass .",
    "the density related to the continuum of states is assumed to vanish below a certain value of @xmath50 called continuum threshold , let us call it @xmath51 . above",
    "@xmath51 one usually considers the ansatz  @xcite @xmath52 using this parametrization of the spectral density , the correlation function from the phenomenological side can be written as @xmath53 to get closer to the idea of the dual nature of the correlation function , a borel transform of eqs .",
    "( [ corrope ] ) and ( [ corrphen ] ) is taken .",
    "this suppresses the contribution of the continuum on the phenomenological side and divergent contributions arising due to the long range interactions on the ope side . equating the borel transformed results , we get the following expression for the mass @xmath54 and that for the coupling @xmath48 @xmath55",
    "in this article we are investigating the possibility of interpreting some of the recently found @xmath15 states , which essentially need more than two valence quarks , with a @xmath0 molecular current .",
    "for this , as explained in the previous section , we use the qcd sum rules method for which we write the general current corresponding to @xmath0 system ( eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) ) and then use spin projectors ( eq .  ( [ proj ] ) ) to obtain the correlation function with spin - parity @xmath29 , @xmath7 and @xmath2 . to obtain the results , we need first to find a valid  borel window \" in which the results can be relied upon .",
    "a valid borel window is that range of borel mass where , on the qcd side , the ope series converges and where the contribution from the pole term dominates over the one of the continuum on the phenomenological side . in order to carry out these calculations we need to fix the value of the continuum threshold , @xmath56 , which should be a reasonable value above the mass of the state we are interested in .",
    "usually it is taken to be 0.5 gev above the mass of the state since , phenomenologically , the average difference between the masses of a hadron and its first excited state is found to be around 0.5 gev . since the principal motivation of our work is to find a description for the recently found @xmath3 @xcite , we take @xmath57 gev . we will , actually , vary the value of @xmath56 around 4.5 gev and test the stability of our results against the variation of this value .",
    "we find that a valid borel window exists for the calculations done with the three spin - projected correlation functions .",
    "it remains to give the values of the other inputs required for the numerical calculations , like the quark condensate , the gluon condensate , the constituent charm quark mass , etc .",
    "we use the same values for these inputs as those used in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "for the readers convenience we also list them here in table  [ parameters ] .",
    ".values of the different inputs required for numerical calculations . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ polecont ] we show the contributions of the pole and continuum terms obtained by calculating the correlation function from the phenomenological side .",
    "this figure shows the results for the correlation function for spin 0 and for @xmath58 gev , as an example .",
    "the results for other configurations and other values of @xmath56 around 4.5 gev are similar .",
    "the right panel shows the results obtained for the different terms in the ope series for the same spin and @xmath56 . the ope results shown in fig .",
    "[ polecont ] are the relative contributions of the different terms of the series .",
    "this means that the result for dimension 0 ( labeled by  dim 0 \" in fig .  [ polecont ] ) is divided by the sum of all the terms in the series of eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) . then the dimension 3 results",
    "are added to dimension 0 and the result is , once again , divided by the sum of all the terms in eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) ( labeled by  dim 3 \" in fig",
    ".  [ polecont ] ) . similarly , one keeps going to the next higher dimension .",
    "thus the legend labels in fig .",
    "[ polecont ] indicate the dimension up to which the ope terms , weighted by the sum of all terms in eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) , have been considered .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ polecont ] , the pole term , on the phenomenological side , dominates up to a squared borel mass @xmath59 2.9 gev@xmath60 while the convergence of the ope series is good beyond the squared borel mass @xmath59 2.65 gev@xmath60 ( where the contribution of the second last term in the series is @xmath6125@xmath62 of the last term ) .",
    "further , in fig .  [ fig : mass ] we show the results obtained for the mass in the three spin configurations for three different values of @xmath56 .",
    "the valid borel window for the different cases is marked by a filled rectangle in the figure .",
    "these results show that there is a reasonable stability in the value of the mass of the states . however , it is further important to check the uncertainty present in our results due to the lack of precision with which the different condensates and the constituent mass of the charm quark are known .",
    "we thus vary all these inputs , one by one , and make an average over all the results obtained .",
    "the range within which the mass varies in the whole process gives us an idea of the total uncertainty present in our calculations .",
    "the masses obtained , considering all these sources of uncertainties , in the three cases are : @xmath63 these results indicate that three states with @xmath0 structure and with very similar masses , same parity , but different spin exist . within the error bars ,",
    "one of these could correspond to the recently observed @xmath3 @xcite for which the spin - parity is assumed to be @xmath7 in ref .",
    "the spin - parity conservation excludes the @xmath29 assignment to this state since it has been found in the @xmath0 mass spectrum in the @xmath64 process .",
    "the @xmath29 state obtained here can probably be related with the @xmath19 state found in ref .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath65 system .",
    "a possibility of understanding @xmath19 as a @xmath0 molecule has earlier been investigated in some works @xcite .    the @xmath7 and @xmath2 states given in eq .",
    "( [ res1 ] ) are both compatible with the @xmath3 found in the @xmath0 mass spectrum in ref .",
    "@xcite although they could also correspond to a state below the threshold ( in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite as we will discuss shortly ) .",
    "the @xmath2 result is in agreement with other work done using qcd sum rules with a tetraquark current  @xcite .",
    "the similarity in our results and those found in ref .",
    "@xcite are expected since it is well known that a tetraquark current and a molecular current with same quantum numbers can be related by a fierz transformation @xcite .",
    "our @xmath7 result is compatible with previous works where @xmath0 moleculelike currents were studied @xcite , although the currents in refs .",
    "@xcite were constructed directly for an axial - vector state .",
    "resonance generation in the @xmath0 system has been studied within effective field theories earlier @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0 system has been investigated with a formalism based on heavy quark symmetry and as a result an isospin 1 resonance with @xmath66 and mass ranging between 3950 - 4017 mev has been found as dynamically generated .",
    "this state has been associated to @xmath3 . on the other hand , in refs .",
    "@xcite a state with only @xmath67 , in the case of isospin 1 , and mass 3900 - 3965 mev has been found in the @xmath0 system . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ res1 ] ) , our results in @xmath7 and @xmath2 configurations are both in good agreement with those found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    from our work ,",
    "thus , both @xmath7 and @xmath2 spin - parity assignments seem to be plausible for @xmath3 , but our mass results , within the error bars , in the two cases are compatible with having a resonance or a bound state in the @xmath0 system .",
    "we have also calculated the coupling of the states found in our work to the corresponding currents .",
    "we find @xmath68 where the error bars have been obtained following the procedure mentioned earlier to calculate the uncertainty in the mass values .",
    "equation  ( [ res2 ] ) indicates that both currents with spin 1 and 2 couple strongly to a @xmath0 state although the current - state coupling in spin 2 seems to be slightly larger . from these results too , like in case of the masses found in eq .",
    "( [ res1 ] ) , both the spin - parity @xmath7 and @xmath2 seem to be equally associable to @xmath3 . in principle , with the results for the mass given in eq .",
    "( [ res1 ] ) , it is also not possible to exclude the possibility of associating the @xmath7 state found in our work with @xmath69 .",
    "although the @xmath0 threshold is about 120 mev far from the mass of @xmath69 and the @xmath0 component should have a weight far too small in the wave function of @xmath69 , the coupling between the two can exist .",
    "then if the @xmath7 state found here could be related to @xmath69 , we would be left with @xmath2 assignment for @xmath3 .",
    "of course , within our formalism , it is not possible to clarify this issue and also if the states found here are resonances or bound states , which even questions the existence of @xmath3 .",
    "in fact very different explanations seem plausible for the signal found by the bes collaboration @xcite when the @xmath0 mass spectrum is calculated for the process @xmath70 considering the production of resonances / bound states with spin - parities @xmath71 or @xmath2 in different partial waves @xcite .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0 system using qcd sum rules with the motivation to find if a moleculelike state could associated to the recently found @xmath3 in the @xmath72 mass spectrum in the process : @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the spin parity of this state is not known .",
    "the @xmath0 system can have total spin 0 , 1 or 2 .",
    "we argue that the two mesons interact in s - wave since a very little energy is available to the @xmath0 system and thus such a state should have a positive parity . with this argument",
    "we obtain the correlation function corresponding to spin - parity @xmath74 using spin projectors of ref .  @xcite . with these correlation functions we carry out the calculation up to dimension 6 on the ope side .",
    "we find the pole dominance and good ope convergence for reasonable values of continuum thresholds . as a result",
    "we find three states with spin - parity @xmath74 each .",
    "the masses of all the states turn out to be very similar .",
    "we conclude that both @xmath7 and @xmath2 assignments could be associated with @xmath3 .",
    "however , our results are also compatible with the formation of bound states in line with the findings of ref .",
    "the @xmath29 state found here can be related with @xmath19  @xcite . to conclude the article",
