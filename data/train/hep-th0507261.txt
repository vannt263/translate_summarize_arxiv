    "one of the main goals of the ads / cft correspondence is to gain insight in the dynamics of the string theory in backgrounds with nonzero ramond - ramond field strength .",
    "integrability is important in the ads / cft program @xcite .",
    "our understanding of classical integrability of the string worldsheet is probably somewhat incomplete at this point , but even the current results are already very impressive .",
    "many explicit solutions are known , and in some sense we have the full construction of the action - angle variables in the finite - gap approach .",
    "there is a remarkable partial agreement with the yang - mills perturbative calculations of the anomalous dimension @xcite .",
    "the most important goal in the classical theory of integrability is to identify the integrable structures which have a transparent meaning in the quantum theory . in the integrable string theory ,",
    "we eventually want to be able to generalize the integrable structures from the sphere to the higher genus surfaces . from this point of view , it would be useful to understand the integrability as much as possible in terms of the objects which are local on the worldsheet",
    ". this would be also important if we want to compare the string theory computations to the yang - mills computations , because the yang - mills diagramms are local in a sense that they involve only the interactions of those partons which are close neighbors on the spin chain .",
    "examples of those objects which are local on the worldsheet are local conserved charges and bcklund equations .",
    "local conserved charges were constructed by pohlmeyer , and in fact bcklund transformations were used to define them @xcite and to actually compute them for particular solutions @xcite .",
    "bcklund transformations allow us to construct the new solution from a given solution , as a solution of the differential equation which we will call the bcklund equation .",
    "the bcklund equation depends on the real parameter @xmath1 .",
    "it is of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the embedding functions of the string worldsheet into the target space and @xmath4 stands for the derivatives with respect to the worldsheet coordinates . solving the bcklund equation involves the choice of the integration constants .",
    "it turns out that for some particular value of the integration constants @xmath5 is in fact a hamiltonian flow of @xmath6 by a certain infinite linear combination of the local conserved charges .",
    "the coefficients of this infinite linear combination depend on @xmath1 . for every @xmath1 we have a hamiltonian @xmath7 and the corresponding hamiltonian vector field @xmath8 such that the flow by the finite time is the bcklund transformation .",
    "this means that , even though the local conserved charges can appear to be complicated in form , in fact the hamiltonian flows generated by certain combinations of these charges by a finite time are controlled by the explicitly known differential equation of the form ( [ generalform ] ) which is in fact closely related to the auxiliary linear problem to `` miwa times '' @xmath9 : @xmath10 .",
    "introducing @xmath9 corresponds to creation of the fermion @xmath11 from the fermi sea .",
    "this approach was developed for example in @xcite . ] .",
    "bcklund transformations are important in the quantum theory @xcite . the hamiltonian is usually related to the quantum bcklund transformation by the baxter s @xmath12 relation . in the context of ads",
    "/ cft correspondence the natural object is not the hamiltonian ( which would not be conformally invariant ) but the discrete `` deck transformation '' which corresponds to the anomalous dimension on the yang - mills side ( see the discussion in section [ sec : deckgeneral ] and in @xcite ) . as we will see in the section [ sec : lift ] ,",
    "the deck transformation is literally a particular example of a bcklund transformation .",
    "it would be very interesting to see if there is an analogue of this fact for the yang - mills diagramms .    in section",
    "[ sec : ba ] we discuss the basic properties of bcklund transformations , prove their canonicity and explain the relation between bcklund transformations and deck transformations .",
    "we also argue that a bcklund transformation can be represented as a hamiltonian flow by a finite time generated by an infinite linear combination of the local conserved charges .",
    "( we will call this infinite linear combination the `` generator '' of the bcklund transformation . )",
    "some of the results of section [ sec : ba ] have already been presented in @xcite . in section [ sec : bp ] we derive the explicit formula ( [ spectrality ] ) , ( [ explicitformula ] ) for the generator .",
    "we present two methods of deriving this formula : using the plane wave limit and using the formula ( [ deltaofsomething ] ) for the variation of the symplectic potential under the bcklund transformation .",
    "we also use the results of @xcite to express the formula ( [ integralformulaforhinfty ] ) for the anomalous dimension conjectured in @xcite in terms of the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix .",
    "we use the properties of bcklund transformation to prove this conjectured formula .",
    "we use the plane wave limit of the local conserved charges and bcklund transformations .",
    "this limit has a clear physical meaning explained in @xcite . in this limit",
    "the string worldsheet theory becomes the theory of free massive fields .",
    "although this is just a limit , in some sense it `` captures '' all the conserved charges , at least the local charges .",
    "therefore we can use the plane wave limit to guess , and even prove , various relations between the conserved charges which hold beyond this limit .",
    "an important property of the ads space is its `` periodicity '' .",
    "it is often convenient to introduce the global coordinates in which the metric becomes : @xmath13 in these coordinates the periodicity corresponds to the discrete symmetry @xmath14 .",
    "it is important that this discrete symmetry commutes with all the global symmetries and in fact belongs to the center of @xmath15",
    ". we will call it `` deck transformation '' , because it is a deck transformation if we think of @xmath16 as the universal covering space of the hyperboloid .",
    "consider the type iib superstring theory on @xmath17 .",
    "it is useful to look at the deviation of the dynamics of the theory from being periodic in @xmath18 .",
    "for example , solutions of the linearized classical supergravity equations are exactly periodic ( invariant under @xmath19 ) , although the solutions of the nonlinear classical supergravity are generally speaking not periodic .",
    "consider a classical string moving in @xmath17 .",
    "if we neglect the backreaction of the string on the ads geometry , then it is possible to quantitatively characterize the deviation of the string worldsheet from being periodic in @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , the transformation @xmath19 is a discrete symmetry and we can ask ourselves how it acts on the string phase space . the classical superstring on @xmath17 is an integrable model , there are infinitely many conserved charges in involution . in some sense these charges generate the `` invariant tori '' .",
    "this is precisely true for the so - called finite - gap solutions .",
    "the hamiltonian flows of these finite - gap solutions fill the finite - dimensional tori .",
    "( for the general solutions we can probably talk about the `` infinite - dimensional tori '' but it is not very clear what these words mean . ) if we represent the invariant torus as a quotient @xmath20 then the transformation @xmath19 would act as a shift by the vector @xmath21 . the numbers @xmath22 characterize quantitatively the deviation of the string worldsheet from being periodic in @xmath18 .",
    "the set of points @xmath23 is usually a dense subset of the invariant torus , and therefore it actually _ defines _ the torus ( the torus is the `` closure '' of this set ) .",
    "this suggests that the action of this discrete symmetry carries a lot of information about the dynamics of the string . on the field theory side",
    "this symmetry measures the anomalous dimension of the corresponding cft operator .",
    "the classical string is the nonlinear sigma - model with the virasoro constrains .",
    "most of the discussion in our paper is valid independently of the virasoro constraints .",
    "if we turn off the fermions , the nonlinear sigma - model on @xmath17 is essentially the product of the sigma - models on @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we will concentrate on the @xmath24-part of the sigma - model .",
    "let us parametrize the points on @xmath26 by the unit vectors @xmath27 , @xmath28 , subject to the constraint @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "this means that we realize @xmath26 as the hyperboloid in @xmath31 . in this subsection",
    "we will consider the bcklund transformations acting on the projection of the string worldsheet to the hyperboloid @xmath26 .",
    "we will consider the lift of the bcklund transformations to the string on @xmath24 in section [ sec : lift ] .",
    "there are infinitely many pohlmeyer charges @xmath32 and @xmath33 introduced in @xmath34 and the corresponding hamiltonian vector fields will be denoted @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we will give a definition of the pohlmeyer charges in section [ sec : definitionofcharges ] , but here we just point out that they are the local conserved charges . a local conserved charge is given by an integral over the closed contour on the string worldsheet of a closed differential 1-form , which is constructed from the worldsheet fields @xmath37 and their derivatives .",
    "the integral does not depend on the choice of the contour because the 1-form is closed . in this sense",
    ", it is a conserved charge .",
    "the existence of infinitely many closed differential 1-forms on the worldsheet is a very nontrivial fact related to the integrability of the worldsheet theory .    given a vector field @xmath38 on the phase space",
    "we can consider the flow of this vector field .",
    "it is a one - parameter family of transformations which we will denote : @xmath39 given a point @xmath40 of the phase space , the flow by the time @xmath41 of this point , denoted @xmath42 , is defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the solution of the differential equation @xmath45 with the initial condition @xmath46 .",

    "the relation between bcklund transformations and the hamiltonian vector fields generated by the local conserved charges in the special case when the motion of the string is restricted to @xmath66 was discussed in @xcite .",

    "we have considered the deck transformation on the _ fast moving _ strings , in the null - surface perturbation theory .",
    "we have shown that at least in the null - surface perturbation theory the deck transformation can be understood as an example of the bcklund transformation ( and in particular it can be connected to the identical transformation by a continuous family of bcklund transformations ) .",
    "this implies that the deck transformation can be understood as the finite time evolution by an infinite linear combination of the local conserved charges .",
    "this can be easily understood in the plane wave limit , when the string worldsheet theory becomes a collection of the free massive fields . in this case , the energy is given by the formula : @xmath355 the first term on the right hand side is the @xmath356 angular momentum @xmath262 ( integer ) , the second term is the total oscillator number ( also integer ) , and the third term , which measures the deviation of @xmath265 from being integer , is an infinite sum of the local charges @xmath357 with some coefficients @xmath198 . on the field theory side",

    ". therefore @xmath362 computes the anomalous dimension .",
    "having related the anomalous dimension to the bcklund transformations , we study the basic properties of the bcklund transformations and give an explicit formula ( [ spectrality ] ) for the `` generator '' of the bcklund transformation .",
    "( [ spectrality ] ) is closely related to the general property of bcklund transformations which is called _ spectrality _ @xcite .",

    "( [ spectrality ] ) is somewhat different from the usual definition of the spectrality .",
    "the definition of @xcite used the generating function which requires the separation of the phase space variables into coordinates and momenta .",
    "we use instead the `` generator '' defined through the `` logarithm '' of the bcklund transformation .",
    "the subject of bcklund transformations is one of the places where the classical theory of integrable systems touches the quantum theory .",
