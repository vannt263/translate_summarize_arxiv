    "studies of the physical properties of asteroids are of fundamental importance to our understanding of the origin , evolution , and structure of the solar system . in order to investigate the compositions of asteroids and the chemical and thermal processes of alternations , it is essential to examine detailed mineralogical characterizations of individual asteroids ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "taxonomic classifications of asteroids represent a broader , alternative approach for appraising the compositions and surface conditions for large numbers of asteroids . as is commonly accepted ( and first explicitly described by  @xcite ) , most asteroids can be classified as either c- or s - type .",
    "c - type asteroids are historically associated with carbonaceous chondrites , and s - type asteroids with stony - iron meteorites .",
    "several outstanding works have defined methodologies for the taxonomic classification of asteroids ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "these taxonomies are based on statistically processed information parameterizing ground - based spectroscopic observations within optical and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "one of the notable results of these taxonomic classifications , as presented by  @xcite ( and also by @xcite ) is the non - uniform heliocentric clustering of taxonomic types in main belt regions ; asteroids of each taxonomic type ( c , s , x , d + ld + t , and v ) show bias - corrected distributions at heliocentric distances of 2.1 to 3.3 au .",
    "the interpretation of these results is that s- , c- , and d - type asteroids are distributed progressively further from the sun in that order , and that the bodies located further from the sun are less affected by metamorphism and contain a greater proportion of primitive materials than those closer to the sun ( i.e. , s - type asteroids are the most metamorphosed and contain the least amount of primitive material and d - type asteroids are the least metamorphosed and contain the greatest proportion of volatile material )",
    ".    albedo data , along with taxonomic classifications of asteroids , also contribute to our understanding of the large - scale distribution of asteroid compositions .",
    "albedo values are strongly dependent on the surface conditions and compositions of asteroids .",
    "the relationship between taxonomic types and albedo is , on the other hand , complex , and type determinations can not be made on the basis of albedo values alone ; the albedos of c- and s - type asteroids vary widely , even though the albedo of c - types is generally low and the albedo of s - types is generally high ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    the most direct way to measure the albedo of asteroids is by in - situ observations using flyby and rendezvous missions ( e.g. , the spacecrafts _ galileo _  @xcite for ( 951 ) gaspra in 1991 and ( 243 ) ida / dactyl in 1993 ; _ near shoemaker _  @xcite for ( 253 ) mathilde in 1996 and ( 433 ) eros in 2000 ; _ deep space 1 _  @xcite for ( 9969 ) braille in 1999 ; _ stardust - next _  @xcite for ( 5535 ) annefrank in 2002 ; _ new horizons _  @xcite for ( 132524 ) apl in 2006 ; _ rosetta _  @xcite for ( 2867 ) steins in 2008 and ( 21 ) lutetia in 2010 ; _ dawn _  @xcite for ( 4 ) vesta in 20112012 ) .",
    "moreover , the sample return from asteroids ( by _ hayabusa _ from ( 25143 ) itokawa in 2005 ;  @xcite ) can provide materials for analytical laboratory determinations of asteroid compositions .",
    "the two most important physical characteristics of asteroids , albedo and size , are coupled by their relationships with the absolute magnitude ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) ; given the size of an asteroid , the albedo value can be uniquely derived on the basis of its absolute magnitude .",
    "several imaging techniques have been developed to determine the shape of asteroids .",
    "the most straightforward approach is by direct imaging of the asteroid , for example , by use of the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "@xcite or large ground - based telescopes with adaptive optics  @xcite .",
    "radar observations  @xcite and speckle interferometry  @xcite are also useful for resolving the shapes of asteroids , as are stellar occultations  @xcite ; the latter is a powerful approach , which relies upon well - organized campaign observations by many participants including amateur astronomers .",
    "although such methods are readily available , they require the convergence of critical conditions , such as the selection of large targets with trajectories approaching the earth , and/or narrow observational windows .",
    "the sheer number of asteroids poses yet another difficulty ; as of 2012 , the number of known asteroids is more than 595,000 ( see e.g. , minor planet center at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory ) , a number which precludes detailed observations of all individual bodies .",
    "one of the most effective indirect methods for measuring the sizes and albedos of asteroids is by radiometry , which uses the combined flux measurements at thermal infrared and reflected optical wavelengths .",
    "the radiometric technique for determining the sizes and albedos of asteroids was developed in the early 1970s using ground - based observatories  @xcite , and the approach has yielded a wealth of information both on individual objects and large populations of asteroids . using radiometric measurements , a large number of objects can be observed in a short period of time , thus providing uniform data for large , relatively unbiased populations within the asteroid belt .",
    "although radiometry requires careful calibration , once calibrated , this method can obtain `` wholesale '' highly accurate measurements of the physical properties of large numbers of asteroids .",
    "infrared observations using ground - based observatories , especially in the mid - infrared range , are severely limited on account of moisture conditions in the telluric atmosphere ; however , infrared measurements obtained using space - borne telescopes are very reliable . furthermore ,",
    "when integrated into an all - sky survey , large numbers of infrared images can be obtained rapidly ; moreover , the data are unbiased and uniform .",
    "the first systematic survey of asteroids using a space telescope was made by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ;  @xcite ) , which cataloged the sizes and albedos of 2470 asteroids  @xcite .",
    "recently , the asteroid catalog was updated with data from the infrared astronomical satellite _ akari _ all - sky survey  @xcite .",
    "the asteroid catalog using _ akari _ ( acua ) contains an inventory of the sizes and albedos of 5120 asteroids  @xcite .",
    "the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ ;  @xcite ) also performed an infrared all - sky survey and the processed data including large amount of asteroid information ( _ wise_/neowise ;  @xcite ) are being compiled .",
    "this paper focuses on the albedos of the main belt asteroids ( mbas ) measured by _",
    "akari_. the spatial distribution of compositions among mbas is of particular interest , because the main belt is the largest reservoir of asteroids in the solar system ; more than 90% of asteroids with known orbital elements are classified as mbas .",
    "asteroids are thought to be the remnants of planetesimals formed in the early solar system  @xcite .",
    "some were formed near to their current locations , and others have migrated from their original birthplaces in conjunction with the migrations of giant planets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "because of cataclysmic events in the history of the solar system , present - day asteroids , especially mbas , are well mixed and represent multiple origins ; they are confined to certain regions on account of resonance effects , and/or have been broken or segmented by mutual collisions .",
    "some asteroids originally formed in volatile - poor regions ( i.e. , the inner parts of the solar system ) , whereas others formed in volatile - rich regions ( i.e. , the outer parts of the solar system , beyond the snow line at the times of formation ) . processes of dynamical evolution and chemical processing may have affected the physical conditions , and hence the albedo properties , of asteroid surfaces .",
    "the main purpose of this study is to examine the size dependencies , frequency distributions , and heliocentric distributions of the albedos of acua mbas , by comparing to recent taxonomic classifications .",
    "famed results about the heliocentric distribution of taxonomic types are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they performed a bias correction method based on  @xcite and  @xcite , that is , asteroids are divided into several zones according to the semimajor axis and the absolute magnitude , and the ratio between the total number of asteroids and the number of classified asteroids in each zone are determined , then this ratio is used as the bias correction factor for estimating the fraction of taxonomies of unclassified objects under the assumption of size and albedo based on the iras data set .",
    "acua , which is based on an all - sky survey that lasted more than one year , provides a complete data set of all known asteroids brighter than the absolute magnitude of @xmath0 for mbas , which correspond to the size for @xmath1 km . when the objects larger than 20 km are used for analysis , no assumptions about size or albedo are needed .",
    "thus we have carried out no bias correction for the magnitude incompleteness in our examination of the albedo properties of mbas .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the features of the acua data base and the division of the main belt into three regions : inner , middle , and outer . in section 3 , we describe investigations of albedo properties of mbas in the context of taxonomic classification . in section 4 , we discuss the reasons for the albedo dependencies which are described in section 3 . finally , section 5 provides a summary .",
    "_ akari _  @xcite surveyed more than 96% of the sky during the 18-month course of the cryogenic cooled phase from 2006 to 2007 .",
    "data were obtained for 6 bands in the mid- to far - infrared spectral range , with a solar elongation of 90@xmath2 @xmath3 1@xmath2 .",
    "the mid - infrared part of the all - sky survey was conducted at two broad bands centered at 9  ( _ s9w _ ) and 18  ( _ l18w _ ) , using an on - board infrared camera ( irc ; @xcite ) .",
    "the 5@xmath4 detection limits at _ s9w _ and _ l18w _ were 50 and 90mjy , respectively , and the spatial resolution of the irc in the all - sky survey mode was less than @xmath510@xmath6 per pixel  @xcite .",
    "point sources were extracted from the irc all - sky survey image data , numbering 4.8 million at _",
    "s9w _ and 1.2 million at _ l18w_. the sources which are detected more than twice are compiled in the irc point source catalog ( irc - psc ;  @xcite ) ; however , about 20% of the extracted sources were not contributed for irc - psc and were remained unused because of a lack of multiple detection at the same position of the sky .",
    "asteroids were included in these `` residual '' sources , due to their motions against the background sky . by matching the data with the positions of known asteroids , about 7000 point sources at _ s9w _ and 14000 point sources at _ l18w _ were identified as asteroids , corresponding to 5120 objects without duplications .",
    "the radiometric diameters ( @xmath7 ) and geometric albedos in the visible wavelengths ( @xmath8 ) of the identified asteroids were calculated using the standard thermal model  @xcite with adjusted beaming parameters of @xmath9 for _ s9w _ and 0.77 for _ l18w _ to reduce the total systematic errors .",
    "taking into account several uncertainties , such as the values of the absolute magnitude and the phase slope parameter , we computed typical uncertainties in the diameters of asteroids to be about @xmath10 , and those in the geometric albedo results to be about @xmath11 .",
    "the _ akari _",
    "asteroid catalog developed on the basis of these analyses contains data on the sizes and albedos of 5120 asteroids .",
    "the catalog is named acua , which is the acronym for asteroid catalog using _",
    "akari_. more details are described in  @xcite .",
    "figure [ hmag histogram ] shows the distribution of @xmath12 for the acua asteroids .",
    "this figure can be interpreted as reflecting the completeness of detections of known asteroids with size and albedo data .",
    "acua , which was constructed based on 16 months of all - sky survey data , provides a complete data set of all asteroids brighter than absolute magnitude of @xmath13 within the semimajor axis of @xmath14 au , and @xmath0 for all mbas .",
    "@xmath0 for mbas corresponds to @xmath1 km in size .",
    "thus , all acua mbas with values of @xmath1 km ( a total of 1974 ) are mainly used in the following discussion .    based on more recent studies ,",
    "the uncertainties of the thermal model calculation in  @xcite can be reevaluated .",
    "@xcite calculated the absolute magnitudes for 583 asteroids from their dedicated photometric observations over thirty years . when compared with the existing database ,",
    "the difference in absolute magnitude between the database values and their new estimation is about 0.08 within the range of @xmath0 .",
    "the divergence of the slope g parameters are also given in @xcite as about 0.083 , though this has little influence on the infrared fluxes , at less than one percent .",
    "the variation of the beaming parameter is given as 0.157 from  @xcite .",
    "these lead to new estimates in the typical uncertainties of acua in the diameters to 13.6% , and those in the albedo to 28.1% .",
    "the number of asteroids inventoried in the acua is summarized in table [ number of asteroids ] .",
    "determinations of each taxonomic type are based on  @xcite , and other references summarized in  @xcite , appendix 4 .",
    "figure [ semj count ] shows histograms of the numbers of acua asteroids as a function of the semimajor axes .",
    "we focus on three regions of the main belt which are defined on the basis of semimajor axis : the inner ( @xmath15 ) , middle ( @xmath16 ) , and outer ( @xmath17 ) regions , where @xmath18 is the semimajor axis in aus .",
    "it should be noted that some near - earth asteroids ( apollos and amors ) which occasionally have semimajor axis in the ranges of mbas , are not considered in the following discussion , and the other group of near - earth asteroids in which @xmath19 au ( atens ) are , by definition , not within main belt regions .",
    "the orbital elements of the asteroids were obtained from the asteroid orbital elements database  @xcite distributed by lowell observatory .",
    "the boundaries of the main belt regions at the semimajor axis @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 au correspond , respectively , to the 4:1 , 3:1 , 5:2 , and 2:1 mean motion resonances of jupiter ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the mean motions and secular resonances of jupiter are the dominant effects on the dynamical evolution of mbas at the present stage of solar system evolution .",
    "the yarkovsky thermal force  @xcite is also known to cause changes in the orbits of asteroids ( mainly affecting the semimajor axis ) , but its effects are less than those of the dynamical resonances on large - size objects .",
    "the numbers of acua asteroids in each region of the main belt ( inner , middle , and outer ) is 858 , 1523 , and 2341 , respectively ( also see table [ number of asteroids ] ) . the number of detected asteroids in the outer region is greater than that in the inner region , implying that the actual number of asteroids is greater in outer regions , compared to the number of observed asteroids , which generally decreases as a function of distance on account of distance - dependent instrumental detection limits ; however , the precise number density of asteroids in each region was not examined . moreover , the number of inner region mbas is about half that of middle region mbas , despite the fact that inner region mbas are more readily detected .",
    "figure [ number count mba ] also illustrates the size distribution of the inner , middle , and outer mbas . concerning the size distribution of asteroids",
    ", the number of asteroids is expected to increase monotonically with decrease in size .",
    "this figure , however , shows maxima at @xmath24 km for the outer mbas .",
    "this suggests that the survey completeness rapidly drops for asteroids smaller than @xmath25 km in the outer region on account of the detection limit of _ akari _ instrumentation .",
    "this size limit is consistent with the fact that acua is complete for all mbas with @xmath0 , as described in section [ acua data ] . in this paper , we consider only the inner , middle , and outer mbas in our comprehensive analysis of the asteroid belt ; we do not consider objects outside of the main belt ( @xmath26 , or @xmath27 ) and do not investigate the properties of the individual dynamical families in detail , which will be discussed in separate papers ; e.g. , the cybele family is studied in  @xcite .",
    "figure [ mba size vs albedo ] shows the distributions of albedo values as a function of asteroid diameter ( @xmath7 ) , for asteroids cataloged in the acua .",
    "the total number of asteroids with @xmath28 km is relatively low , on account of the detection limit for small bodies ( see  @xcite , figure 8a ) .",
    "notably , the distributions of albedo values for the asteroids in each region are bimodal .",
    "figure [ fig : summary for taxonomic classes ] shows the distribution of albedo values of acua mbas as a function of asteroid size , separated by taxonomic type .",
    "it should be noted that the taxonomic type is known for 2496 acua asteroids ( 53% of the total number of detected mbas ) .",
    "it should also be noted that the taxonomic type was determined using data from the literature mentioned above , and not from _ akari _ observations ; this is because ( 1 ) the _ akari _ observations were conducted at infrared , not optical , wavelengths , and ( 2 ) the two _ akari _ mid - infrared channels ( _ s9w _ and _ l18w _ ) did not observe the same region of the sky simultaneously ; thus , a complete data set for each asteroid was not always obtained ( see  @xcite , details ) .",
    "figure [ fig : summary for taxonomic classes ] reveals that the clusters of high- and low - albedo asteroids depicted in figure [ mba size vs albedo ] correspond to s - type and c - types asteroids . in both distributions , it is found that the scatter in albedo among the smaller asteroids increases .",
    "the albedo values of x - type asteroids are widely distributed .",
    "the albedo values of d - type asteroids are moderately low , and the number of d - type asteroids is relatively small ( see table [ table : summary for 5 types ] ) .",
    "x - type asteroids , which have featureless flat or slightly reddened spectra over optical wavelengths , are spectrally degenerate and can be classified into three subclasses only on the basis of albedo values  @xcite , as e - type : @xmath29 ( high albedo ) , m - type : @xmath30 ( medium albedo ) , and p - type : @xmath31 ( low albedo ) .",
    "these three classes are spectrally similar to each other , but have very different inferred mineralogy , as e - type : containing enstatite - rich aubrites , m - type : containing metallic iron cores , and p - type : carbon and/or organic - rich . according to the classification based on albedo values , of the 490 x - type acua mbas , 14 are e - type , 145 are m - type , and 331 are p - type . note that for 90% of these x - type mbas , the acua albedos provide the first sub - classification into e- , m- , and p - types .",
    "the largest e - type member is ( 71 ) niobe ( @xmath32 km , @xmath33 ) in the middle mbas .",
    "the mean albedos of each subclass are presented in table [ mean albedo for x - type ] .",
    "note that there are two objects that show inconsistency between taxonomic type and albedo value .",
    "while ( 498 ) tokio was classified as an m - type asteroid in a previous work  @xcite , the albedo value of this object is @xmath34 by _ akari _ ( or @xmath35 by the _ iras _ ) ; thus , ( 498 ) is a p - type , not an m - type , asteroid .",
    "( 55 ) pandora was also classified as an m - type asteroid ( also by  @xcite ) ; however , it is an e - type asteroid ( @xmath36 by _ akari _ or @xmath37 by the _ iras _ ) .",
    "( 498 ) and ( 55 ) are middle mbas .",
    "figure [ fig : mba x - type albedo histogram ] shows the albedo distribution of x - type asteroids .",
    "there are two major components found in this figure , the m - type with @xmath38 and p - type with @xmath39 . from this distribution",
    ", it seems reasonable that the boundary between medium - albedo m - type and low - albedo p - type is set as @xmath40 . on the other hand ,",
    "no clear boundary is found around @xmath41 , between e- and m - type .",
    "two large and high - albedo asteroids are observed among the d - types : ( 9 ) metis ( @xmath42 km , @xmath43 ) is an inner mba , and ( 224 ) oceana ( @xmath44 km , @xmath45 ) is a middle mba .",
    "these were considered as d - type asteroids by  @xcite , but were recently reclassified as s - type ( 9 ) and m - type ( 224 ) asteroids  @xcite ; albedo values for these asteroids in the acua also support this classification of  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mba inner - middle - outer ] shows histograms of asteroid albedo values for the inner , middle , and outer region . in figure",
    "[ mba size vs albedo ] ( also see  @xcite , figure 8b ) , the `` bimodal '' distribution of albedo is clearly visible .",
    "the population densities of the low- and high - albedo components are , however , not the same ; the peak of the low albedo distribution is about twice that of the high albedo distribution .",
    "this same pattern is observed in the inner , middle , and outer region distributions as figure [ mba size vs albedo ] , but the detailed features of each distribution vary . in the inner region ( red lines in figure [ fig : mba inner - middle - outer ] ) , the peak of the high albedo distribution is nearly the same as , or a little higher than , that of the lower albedo distribution . in the middle and outer region",
    "asteroids ( green and blue lines in figure [ fig : mba inner - middle - outer ] ) , the low albedo component is dominant , and the peak of the high albedo distribution is nearly buried in the long tail of the low albedo component ; this pattern is especially prominent in the albedo distributions of the smaller asteroids .",
    "another outstanding feature of the albedo distributions is that , for the large asteroids ( figure [ fig : mba inner - middle - outer]c ) , the distributions are clearly divided at @xmath46 ; this division is less pronounced in the small asteroids ; the mean albedo value of the total population of 4722 acua mbas is @xmath47 .",
    "this division in the albedo distribution was also observed in data from the _ iras _ asteroid catalog  @xcite ; however , the boundary was observed at @xmath48  @xcite .",

    "acua covers a complete data set of all mbas with @xmath1 km .",
    "we should note that there is a possible selection effect in the determination of the taxonomic type , i.e. , spectroscopic data have been preferentially obtained from brighter ( larger size , higher albedo ) objects and/or particular family members , and hence these objects are more heavily represented in the data than are darker objects .",
    "figure [ fig : mba taxonomy fraction]a illustrates the numbers of acua mbas of each taxonomic type . as observed in figure [ semj count ] , the number of detected asteroids increases with increasing semimajor axis , except for large deviations at @xmath49 au .",

    "we observed distributions of s - type and d - type asteroids similar to those of @xcite ; that is , s - type asteroids are dominant in the inner region , with relative proportions decreasing with an increase in semimajor axis ; d - type asteroids comprise @xmath50% of the total number of asteroids , but their relative proportions gradually increase with increasing semimajor axis .",
    "our data on the fractions of c - type and x - type asteroids depart from those of @xcite by @xmath51% ; the fraction of c - type in this work is less than that in @xcite , and that of x - type is more than that in @xcite .",
    "this result could be caused by biases related to the number of taxonomic identifications . in the literature ,",

    "the mean albedo of p - types is @xmath56 of total 251 ( table [ mean albedo for x - type ] ) , which is also similar to c : @xmath57 , or d : @xmath58 ( table [ table : summary for 5 types ] ) . from this",

    "figure [ fig : mba inner - middle - outer type stacked ratio 20 km ] presents the dependency of mean albedo on heliocentric distance . in the total population of asteroids ,",
    "albedo gradually decreases as the semimajor axis increases ; i.e. , asteroids located further from the sun are darker . on the other hand , within individual taxonomic types , the heliocentric distributions of mean albedo are nearly constant throughout the entire main belt , although albedo variations at any given distance are large .",
    "thus , the albedo within a given taxonomic type is relatively independent of heliocentric distance .",
    "the cause of the decline in the mean albedo of the total distribution in outer regions is not the heliocentric distance itself , but the influence of the compositional mixing ratios of taxonomic types , as observed in figure [ fig : mba taxonomy fraction ] .",
    "as observed in figure [ fig : summary for taxonomic classes ] , the albedo of asteroids is dependent on its size .",
    "this does not mean , however , that smaller asteroids tend to have higher albedos ; rather , it implies that the diversity of albedo values is greater for smaller asteroids than for larger asteroids .",
    "acua provides a complete data set for @xmath0 , which corresponds to @xmath1 km .",
    "moreover , detectability with _",
    "akari _ does not depend on albedo .",
    "this is because the thermal flux of an asteroid is hardly dependent on albedo ( surface temperature is proportional to @xmath59 , which has a value in a range from 0.99 to 0.93 with @xmath8 of 0.01 to 0.6 , where @xmath60 is the bond albedo ) , while the visible reflected component of sunlight is proportional to the albedo . for these reasons ,",
    "the scatter in albedo among the smaller objects should be real , not a bias effect ; even so , taxonomic information is available only for 53% of the total mbas in acua , or 71% of @xmath1 km mbas in acua .",
    "taxonomic classifications are derived from spectroscopic studies of asteroids , which have strong observational selection biases . especially for asteroid with @xmath61 km",
    ", our study of the size - albedo distribution of mbas rapidly becomes incomplete due to the sensitivity limits of _",
    "spacecraft explorations show that most asteroid surfaces are covered with regolith and/or numerous boulders in a wide range of sizes .",
    "for example , a unique boulder with an unusually low brightness is found to sit on top of the asteroid ( 25143 ) itokawa like a benchmark  @xcite .",
    "several interpretations for the origin of this distinct `` black boulder '' , which is about 40% darker than surrounding materials , have been considered ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such local heterogeneities are averaged out and nearly homogenized in the global view , and only a small degree of regional variation on surfaces is observed . however , especially for smaller asteroids , the effects of these heterogeneities are conspicuous relative to their sizes .",
    "this could partly explain the albedo variations at smaller sizes .    for s - type asteroids ,",
    "albedo dependency can be explained by the space weathering of stony chondritic asteroids .",
    "the collisional life times and surface ages of s - type asteroids are correlated with their sizes  @xcite ; thus , fresher and smaller objects are less space weathered and their albedos are relatively higher  @xcite .",
    "space weathering effects cause the visible and near - infrared reflectance spectra of stony asteroids to be darker and redder than those of pristine materials  @xcite .",
    "ground - based observations suggest that a color transition exists between ordinary chondrite - like objects and s - type asteroids over the size range 0.15 km , which implies that the surfaces of small stony asteroids are evolving towards the colors of large asteroids  @xcite .",
    "our data indicate that the albedo transition occurs in the size range of @xmath62 km .",
    "in contrast to s - type asteroids , the reason for the albedo transition in c - type asteroids is less known .",
    "the relationship between age and the space weathering effect in c - type asteroids has been mentioned in several papers ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , however , the relationship is still uncertain , mainly on account of the `` darkness '' of c - type asteroids .",
    "laboratory measurements indicate that thermally metamorphosed samples of carbonaceous chondrites possess high absolute reflectance  @xcite , which could cause the high albedo of asteroids .",
    "figure [ thermally metamorphosis ] shows the dependence of the absolute reflectance of chondrites on the degree of metamorphism  @xcite .",
    "the classification of metamorphism in chondritic meteorites is qualitatively determined  @xcite : the most pristine materials are type 3 ; types 4 to 6 represent an increasing degree of thermal metamorphism , and types 2 to 1 represent an increasing degree of aqueous alteration .",
    "while thermal metamorphism and aqueous alteration are related to different mechanisms of recrystallization , the classification from 1 to 6 can be taken to represent an increasing degree of metamorphism .",
    "the metamorphism of chondrites occurs in the inner parts of the parent body , which is internally heated by the decay energy of short - lived radioisotopes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in a catastrophic disruption caused by a highly energetic impact , small fragments , including those from the inner portion of a parent body , are exposed .",
    "asteroids smaller than a few 10s of kilometers are considered to be formed mainly by collisional breakup  @xcite ; thus , the high albedo of some materials may have been derived from deeper thermal metamorphic processes .",
    "in other materials , however , the albedo might be due to the presence of reaccumulated fragments ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and/or a regolith layer  @xcite .",
    "thus , a variety of processes might cause the albedo variation at smaller sizes .",
    "no clear dependency of albedo on size is found for d - type asteroids in figure [ fig : summary for taxonomic classes]d , while the number of detected d - types is relatively small .",
    "some researchers have distinguished between the features of inner d - type and outer d - type varieties of d - type asteroids ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "d - type asteroids dominate the jovian trojans , but become rarer at smaller heliocentric distances .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the variations in d - type asteroids might be related to different origins and evolutionary histories , or to different processes of differentiation occurring closer to the sun .",
    "indeed , the actual mineralogical characterization of d - type asteroids is difficult to ascertain because of their small number of samples ( except for the tagish lake meteorite ;  @xcite ) .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the albedo properties of mbas detected by _",
    "akari _ and recorded in the acua . of the 5120 acua asteroids , 4722 are mbas , and 1974 are provided as a complete data set of mbas larger than @xmath1 km . as is already known ,",
    "the albedo distribution of mbas is strongly bimodal ; this trend is present not only in the distribution of the total population , but also in the distributions of inner , middle , and outer mbas .",
    "the bimodal distributions are separated into two major groups at an albedo value of @xmath40 , which demarcates low - albedo c - type and high - albedo s - type asteroids . in each group ,",
    "the albedo distribution is size - dependent , and the variation in albedo values is greater at smaller sizes . for smaller asteroids ,",
    "the effects of surface heterogeneities on albedo are relatively large , while such local heterogeneities are averaged out and seemingly homogenized for larger asteroids . moreover , albedo distributions in s - type asteroids appear to be affected by the space weathering , whereas the albedo distributions in c - type asteroids are partially explained by the effects of metamorphism .",
    "we examined the heliocentric distributions of mean albedo values for each taxonomic type . in spite of the influence of the space weathering and other albedo transition processes ,",
    "the mean albedo is nearly constant and independent of heliocentric distance throughout the entire main belt region , irrespective of taxonomic type . in the total distribution ,",
    "on the other hand , the mean albedo value gradually decreases with increasing the semimajor axis , presumably due to the compositional mixing ratios of taxonomic types .",
    "almost 90% of the x - type mbas in the acua data set can now be subdivided into the e- , m- , and p - types based on the _ akari_-derived albedos . the distribution of p - types , which have lower albedos among the x - types , are spread throughout the main belt regions , and increases beyond 3 au , while the proportion of medium - albedo m - types decreases .",
    "p - type asteroids are considered to have similar origin or similar evolutional process , to c- or d - types .",
