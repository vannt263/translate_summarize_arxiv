    "we study the ground states of a bound one - particle system in two different theories : the spinless - salpeter equation @xcite , and the relativistic klein  gordon equation @xcite .",

    "salpeter equation constitutes a well - defined approximation to the bethe ",
    "salpeter formalism for the description of bound states within ( relativistic ) quantum field theory .",
    "it may be deduced from the bethe ",
    "salpeter equation by assuming that ( a ) the interactions between the involved bound - state constituents are instantaneous  which leads to the so - called static limit  and ( b ) all bound - state constituents propagate like free particles , and by neglecting both negative - energy contributions and the spin degrees of freedom of the bound - state constituents . on an equal footing",
    ", the spinless - salpeter equation may be regarded as the simplest conceivable generalization of the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation towards the incorporation of relativistic dynamics .    in units with @xmath5",
    "if @xmath6 is a bound - state wave function , and the operator @xmath7 then for states corresponding to @xmath8 we may define the corresponding radial function @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 since @xmath12 we now write the kinetic - energy operator as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 in this notation , the radial eigenequations corresponding to an attractive central vector potential @xmath15 , and zero scalar potential @xmath16 , may be written respectively as @xmath17 @xmath18 the normalization condition for the radial functions is explicitly @xmath19 when the klein  gordon radial equation  ( [ eqkg ] ) is written in this way , @xmath20 becomes a schrdinger operator depending on a real parameter @xmath3 : for suitable @xmath15 and values of @xmath3 , @xmath20 has a discrete lowest eigenvalue , which we write as @xmath21 the parameter @xmath3 becomes a klein  gordon eigenvalue when it satisfies @xmath22 we may think of this as an intersection point of two graphs , that of @xmath23 and the graph of @xmath24 ; thus there is a klein  gordon eigenvalue if and only if these two graphs intersect ; the lowest klein  gordon eigenvalue is the smallest value of @xmath3 over all such intersection points .",
    "we shall consider some examples below .",
    "we emphasize that in our later discussions , @xmath23 always represents the lowest eigenvalue of the schrdinger operator @xmath20 .",
    "the potentials we consider are of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the potential shape , and @xmath27 is a coupling parameter .",
    "we shall assume that the shape @xmath28 is non decreasing , no more singular than coulomb at @xmath29 and vanishes as @xmath30 the semirelativistic and klein  gordon problems share some features and differ in others .",
    "they both support discrete eigenvalues for the coulomb potential @xmath31 only if the coupling is not too large : for example , with @xmath32 we require for the semirelativistic problem @xcite @xmath33 and for the klein  gordon equation @xmath34 ; we note parenthetically that for the dirac equation ( in which @xmath35 is the vector potential ) , we require @xmath36 corresponding to @xmath37 and @xmath38 . for the exponential potential @xmath39 the two equations that we now study both require the coupling @xmath40 to be sufficiently large to give binding , but , whereas the semirelativistic equation has a discrete eigenvalue for arbitrarily large values of @xmath40 , in the klein  gordon case ( again with @xmath41 ) , if @xmath40 is increased beyond about @xmath42 the ground state @xmath43 soon becomes ` supercritical ' as @xmath3 attempts to venture into the region @xmath44 in fact , for the klein  gordon problem with this class of attractive potentials ,",
    "the allowed coupling is generally restricted by the requirement @xcite that @xmath45 thus , in comparing @xmath1 with the corresponding @xmath3 for the same potential and mass , we shall restrict the coupling @xmath40 , above and below , so that both eigenvalues exist . with these assumptions",
    ", we can state the principal result of this paper , namely that @xmath46 when @xmath47 this result is not difficult to establish ; for the general case , including negative @xmath3 , we shall need to prove that with @xmath40 fixed , @xmath48 increases with @xmath49    we note that for unbounded potentials , quite outside the considered class , such as the harmonic oscillator @xmath50 the semirelativistic problem has bound states @xcite , but the corresponding klein  gordon problem has no discrete spectrum at all .",
    "such problems are therefore not compatible with the main purpose of this paper and will not be discussed further here .    in the next section we state more precisely what our assumptions are and we set out our main results in two theorems and a convexity lemma .",
    "we provide some illustrations in that section in terms of the exponential potential @xmath51 in section  3 we look at the woods  saxon nuclear potential @xmath52 $ ] @xcite and provide upper and lower energy bounds to the semirelativistic energy @xmath1 , as functions of the coupling @xmath53 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fg ] we illustrate these two potential shapes as examples of the class of potentials we are studying .     and @xmath54 in dimensionless units.,width=453 ]",
    "we shall find it helpful to define the value of the parameter @xmath3 that gives rise to a zero eigenvalue for @xmath20 of eq .",
    "( [ eqkg ] ) to be @xmath55 : thus @xmath56 we must now characterize the @xmath23 curves more generally .",
    "we shall first show in general that @xmath23 is negative , decreasing , and concave . in order to do this",
    "it is simplest to fix the parameter @xmath40 suitably and think of the solution to @xmath57 as the function @xmath58 since the potentials @xmath15 we are considering are negative and vanish at infinity , whenever the eigenvalue @xmath23 of @xmath20 exists , it must be negative . since the klein ",

    "we write the normalized klein ",
    "gordon eigenfunction as @xmath61 , which , for real potentials , we may without loss of generality assume to be real .",
    "we indicate partial derivatives with respect to the parameter @xmath3 by a subscript , thus @xmath62 by differentiating @xmath63 with respect to @xmath3 we obtain the orthogonality relation @xmath64 we now differentiate the equation @xmath65 with respect to @xmath66 to obtain @xmath67e'(m).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using the self - adjointness of @xmath20 and the orthogonality relation , we find from  eq .",

    "( [ eqeprime ] ) that if @xmath71 then @xmath72 we have studied an example of this earlier @xcite , namely the coulomb ( or gravity ) case @xmath73 , with @xmath40 not too large : for this problem , the coupling @xmath40 can never be large enough to generate negative klein ",
    "gordon eigenvalues @xmath3 and consequently we predict that @xmath74 ( as indeed we know from the exact solution ) , and therefore we know that @xmath75 in this earlier work we could solve the kratzer",
    " schrdinger problem @xcite exactly for @xmath23 and , in turn , @xmath3 could be found by solving @xmath76 algebraically .",
    "thus a more general theory was unnecessary for that particular problem .",
    "but , to return to the present task , we still need to prove generally that @xmath74 even when @xmath3 is negative .",
    "we first establish the concavity of @xmath23 by proving the lemma    * lemma  1 : * _ @xmath23 is concave . _    * proof : *  we suppose that @xmath43 and @xmath77 are respectively the normalized ground states of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath80 thus @xmath23 lies beneath its tangents and is concave .    a function that is important for the theory is @xmath81",
    "since @xmath23 is concave , we may assume @xmath82 we now state and prove the first theorem .",
    "* theorem  1 : * _ let @xmath1 be the lowest eigenvalue of the spinless ",

    "_    * proof : *  with the potential parameters fixed and @xmath66 sufficently large , we can see from the klein  gordon equation ( [ eqkg ] ) that we certainly obtain a solution if the schrdinger operator @xmath20 has eigenvalues @xmath23 that are negative . for the present consideration",
    "we re - write the klein  gordon equation as @xmath87 a klein  gordon eigenvalue @xmath3 is a parameter value in @xmath20 such that the graph of @xmath23 intersects the graph of @xmath24 . for this to happen , @xmath66 must be sufficiently large , and such a solution lies in the interval @xmath88 meanwhile , with the same set of ( compatible ) potential parameters , if we write the semirelativistic equation ( [ eqsal ] ) in the form @xmath89 , and then square the equal vectors , we obtain @xmath90 the inequality arises from the variational principle applied to the schrdinger operator @xmath91 in which the parameter @xmath3 has been set to the value @xmath92 thus we have @xmath93 a slack variable @xmath94 can be introduced to convert this last inequality into the equality @xmath95 .",
    "we may now summarize the relation between the klein ",
    "gordon energy @xmath3 and the semirelativistic energy @xmath1 corresponding to a compatible attractive potential @xmath15 by the equations : @xmath96 our main result @xmath86 will be established if we can find conditions sufficient to show that the solution @xmath48 of the klein  gordon problem @xmath57 increases with @xmath66 .",
    "we first obtain an expression for @xmath97 and then consider the two cases @xmath83 and @xmath98 in order to fix ideas , we first consider an example . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f(e)exp ] we have plotted the spectral curves @xmath23 for the potential @xmath99 and @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( the left and right falling @xmath23 curves ) .",
    "we have also plotted the u - shaped curves representing @xmath102 with @xmath103 and @xmath104 the klein ",
    "gordon energy is the @xmath3 value at the intersection of an @xmath23 and a @xmath105 graph .",
    "when we follow each @xmath23 curve down in fig .",
    "[ fig : f(e)exp ] , it is clear that the two solutions in the example both satisfy @xmath106 in fig .",

    "[ fig : f(e)woodssaxon ] we exhibit corresponding curves for the woods ",
    "saxon potential ( which we discuss later , in section  3 ) .",
    "the situation is similar for the whole class of potentials which we study in this paper .",
    "we now consider the case @xmath98 it follows from the concavity of @xmath23 that @xmath107 thus , if @xmath108 then , as @xmath3 increases , @xmath109 remains positive . since @xmath110 we know from eq .",
    "( [ eqeprime ] ) that @xmath74 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath111 these facts tell us that , as @xmath3 increases , @xmath109 remains positive , and so does @xmath97 .",
    "if @xmath112 then @xmath113 this proves theorem  1 .",
    "theorem  1 supposes that the klein ",
    "gordon solution @xmath84 satisfies @xmath114 we now explore some sufficient conditions for this to happen , based on a certain critical value @xmath55 of @xmath3 .",
    "we suppose that , for a given potential @xmath115 , there is a value @xmath55 of @xmath3 such that @xmath56 if @xmath116 then solutions of @xmath117 satisfy @xmath118 we therefore do not discuss this possibility further , but rather assume that @xmath119 we now consider two cases : ( i ) @xmath120 and ( ii ) @xmath121 in case ( i ) , if @xmath122 then there could be two klein  gordon solutions , @xmath123 with @xmath124 : in this event , @xmath125 and we know by theorem  1 that @xmath126 meanwhile , if @xmath127 there are no solutions because the graphs of @xmath23 and @xmath105 have opposite convexities and never meet .",
    "this leaves us with case ( ii ) , which allows us to prove :    * theorem  2 : * _ let @xmath1 be the lowest eigenvalue of the spinless  salpeter equation ( [ eqsal ] ) and @xmath3 be the lowest eigenvalue of the klein  gordon equation ( [ eqkg ] ) , then , if @xmath83 , or @xmath128 then @xmath86 .",

    "consequently , at the intersection we must have @xmath130 , that is to say , @xmath131 or @xmath114 therefore , we know from theorem  1 that @xmath132     the curves are the schrdinger energies @xmath23 of the operator @xmath133 for @xmath134 and @xmath101 , along with the curves @xmath135 for @xmath136 and @xmath137 , in units with @xmath138 the intersection points yield the klein ",
