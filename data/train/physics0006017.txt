    "theoretical studies of atoms and molecules in strong external fields are motivated by several applications .",
    "the latter are e.g. experiments with intense laser beams ( electromagnetic fields with dominating electric component ) and astronomical observations of white dwarfs and neutron stars ( magnetic fields ) . the experimental availability of extremely strong electric fields in laser beams makes the theoretical study of various atomic and molecular species under such conditions very desirable .",
    "the properties of atomic and molecular systems in strong fields undergo dramatic changes in comparison with the field - free case .",
    "these changes are associated with the strong distortions of the spatial distributions of the electronic density and correspondingly the geometry of the electronic wavefunctions .",
    "this complex geometry is difficult for its description by means of traditional sets of basis functions and requires more flexible approaches which can , in particular , be provided by multi - dimensional mesh finite - difference methods .",
    "let us discuss the problem of atoms in a strong magnetic field in more detail .",
    "we start this consideration with the hydrogen atom which was the first atom whose behaviour in strong magnetic fields was investigated ( for a list of references see @xcite ) . in cylindrical coordinates",
    "@xmath4 its non - relativistic hamiltonian has the form ( we use atomic units throughout our work ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the magnetic quantum number , @xmath7 is the spin @xmath8 projection and @xmath9 , @xmath10 t is the magnetic field strength in atomic units .",
    "the magnetic field is parallel to the @xmath8 axis .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hfscham ] ) contains two potentials of different spatial symmetries : the spherical - symmetric coulomb term @xmath11 and the cylindrically symmetric potential of the magnetic field @xmath12 . when considering the impact of the competing coulomb and diamagnetic interaction it is reasonable to distinguish the three different regimes of weak , strong and intermediate fields . in the latter case",
    "the magnetic and coulomb forces are comparable . in the case of relatively weak fields",
    "the main features of the geometry of the wavefunction are determined by the dominating coulomb term whereas the effect of the magnetic field can be consider as a perturbation of the coulomb wavefunctions . for the opposite situation of very strong magnetic fields and dominating cylindrical symmetry the adiabatic approximation",
    "@xcite was the main theoretical tool during the last four decades .",
    "this approximation separately considers the fast motion of the electron across the field and its slow motion in a modified coulomb potential along the field direction .",
    "both early ( see @xcite ) and more recent works @xcite on the hydrogen atom have used different approaches for these regimes of the magnetic field .",
    "all these calculations had problems when considering the hydrogen atom in fields of intermediate strength .",
    "the detailed calculations of the hydrogen energy levels carried out by rsner _",
    "et al _ @xcite also retained the separation into different regimes of the field strength by decomposing the electronic wave function either in terms of spherical ( weak to intermediate fields ) or cylindrical ( intermediate to high fields ) orbitals .",
    "a solution allowing to obtain comprehensive results on low - lying energy levels of the hydrogen atom for arbitrary field strengths including the intermediate field regime is provided by the multi - dimensional mesh solution of the schrdinger equation @xcite .    for different electronic degrees of excitation of the atom the intermediate regime",
    "is met for different absolute values of the field strength . for the ground state",
    "this regime is roughly given by @xmath13 .",
    "for atoms with several electrons there are two decisive factors which enrich the possible changes in the electronic structure with varying field strength compared to the one - electron system .",
    "first , we have a third competing interaction which is the electron - electron repulsion and , second , the different electrons feel very different coulomb forces , i.e. possess different one particle energies , and consequently the regime of the intermediate field strengths appears to be the sum of the intermediate regimes for the separate electrons .    the fact that most methods have problems in the intermediate field region has consequences for the current state of the art of our knowledge on on multi - electron atoms in strong magnetic fields .",
    "there exist a number of such investigations in the literature @xcite .",
    "the majority of them deals with the adiabatic regime in superstrong fields and the early works are mostly hartree - fock ( hf ) type calculations .",
    "there are also several early variational calculations for the low - field domain @xcite .",
    "hf calculations for arbitrary field strengths have been carried out in refs.@xcite by applying two different sets of basis functions in the high- and low - field regimes . as a result of the complicated geometry",
    "this approach suffers in the intermediate regime from very slow convergence and low accuracy of the calculated energy eigenvalues .",
    "accurate hf calculations for arbitrary field strengths were carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite by the 2d mesh hf method .",
    "investigations on the ground state as well as a number of excited states of helium including the correlation energy have recently been performed via a quantum monte carlo approach @xcite .",
    "very recently benchmark results with a precision of @xmath14 for the energy levels have been obtained for a large number of excited states with different symmetries using a configuration interaction approach with an anisotropic gaussian basis set @xcite .",
    "focusing on systems with more than two electrons however the number of investigations is very scarce @xcite . in view of the above",
    "there is a need for further quantum mechanical investigations and for data on atoms with more than two electrons in a strong magnetic field . for the carbon atom there",
    "exist two investigations @xcite in the adiabatic approximation which give a few values for the binding energies in the high field regime and one more relevant recent work by jones _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , our two - dimensional hartree - fock approach allowed us recently to perform precise and reliable consideration of a series of multi - electron atoms for the whole range of the magnetic field strengths from @xmath15 up to ultrastrong fields @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "our calculations for multi - electron atoms in magnetic fields are carried out under the assumption of an infinitely heavy nucleus in the ( unrestricted ) hartree - fock approximation .",
    "the solution is established in the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath17 with the @xmath8-axis oriented along the magnetic field .",
    "we prescribe to each electron a definite value of the magnetic quantum number @xmath18 .",
    "each single - electron wave function @xmath19 depends on the variables @xmath20 and @xmath4 @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the numbering of the electrons .",
    "the resulting partial differential equations for @xmath23 have been presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the one - particle equations for the wave functions @xmath23 are solved by means of the fully numerical mesh method described in refs .",
    "@xcite . in our first works on the helium atom in magnetic fields",
    "@xcite we calculated the coulomb and exchange integrals by means of a direct summation over the mesh nodes .",
    "but this direct method is very expensive with respect to the computer time and due to this reason we obtained in the following works @xcite these potentials as solutions of the corresponding poisson equation .",
    "the problem of the boundary conditions for the poisson equation as well as the problem of simultaneously solving poisson equation on the same meshes with schrdinger - like equations for the wave functions @xmath23 have been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the simultaneous solution of the poisson equations for the coulomb and exchange potentials and schrdinger - like equations for the wave functions @xmath23 is a complicated computational problem , especially for atoms in strong magnetic fields .",
    "the problem consists in the different geometry of the spatial distribution of the electron density and the potentials correspondent to this density . in strong magnetic fields",
    "the distributions of the electronic densities are compressed towards the @xmath8 axis and look like needles directed along the @xmath8 axis . the equations for the wavefunctions can be solved in finite cylindrical domains as done in refs .",
    "@xcite . for strong magnetic fields @xmath24",
    "these domains can be rather small in the @xmath25 direction .",
    "on the other hand , the potentials created by these charge distributions can not have such a strongly anisotropic form and the poisson equations for them must be solved on meshes with the distribution of nodes not very different for the @xmath8 and @xmath25 directions .",
    "this means some loss of the precision for the wavefunctions due to a decrease of the number of nodes in the area of a large electronic density .",
    "the most difficult problem , however , is the different asymptotic behaviour of the wavefunctions and potentials .",
    "the wavefunctions of the bound electrons decrease exponentially as @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the distance from the origin ) .",
    "this simplifies the problem of the solution of the corresponding equations in the infinite space because it is possible either to solve these equations in a finite domain @xmath28 ( with simple boundary conditions @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) with negligible errors for domains of reasonable dimensions or otherwise to solve these equations in the infinite space on meshes with exponentially growing distances between nodes as @xmath26 .",
    "the solutions of the poisson equations for non - zero sums of charges decrease as @xmath11 as @xmath26 . in result ,",
    "every spatial restriction of the domain @xmath28 introduces a significant error into the final solution . in some other mesh hartree - fock approaches developed for diatomic molecules",
    "( e.g. see @xcite ) this problem has been solved for finite @xmath28 by introducing special boundary conditions for the potentials obtained from the asymptotic behaviour of the potentials .",
    "this approach , being in principle approximate , requires additional calculations with different extensions of @xmath28 to estimate the error .    in the present approach",
    "we address the above problems by using special forms of non - uniform meshes @xcite .",
    "solutions to the poisson equation on separate meshes contain some errors @xmath31 associated with an inaccurate description of the potential far from the nucleus .",
    "however due to the special form of the function @xmath32 for these meshes ( where @xmath33 is a formal mesh step ) the errors do not show up in the final results for the energy and other physical quantities , which we obtain by means of the richardson extrapolation procedure ( polynomial extrapolation to @xmath34 @xcite ) .",
    "the main requirement for these meshes is not an exponential , but a polynomial increase of the mesh step @xmath33 when @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , this behaviour can be only linear one , i.e. @xmath35 as @xmath26 .",
    "the error of the mesh solution in this case has the form of a polynomial of the formal step of the mesh @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of nodes along one of the coordinates . in practical calculations",
    "these meshes are introduced by means of an orthogonal coordinate transformation from the physical coordinates @xmath38 to the mathematical ones @xmath39 made separately for @xmath25 and @xmath8 .",
    "and the numerical solution is , in fact , carried out on uniform meshes in the mathematical coordinates @xmath39 .",
    "the characteristic feature of these meshes consists of rapidly increasing coordinates of several outermost nodes when increasing the total number of nodes and decreasing the actual mesh step in the vicinity of the origin . due to this property",
    "we call these meshes `` run away '' meshes . to be concrete we present here two such meshes :    \\1 .",
    "the `` plain poisson '' mesh is generated by the coordinate transformation @xmath40 @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 is a constant .",
    "this simplest mesh of this group is near to the uniform ones near the origin ( i.e. a plot of the distance between the neighbouring nodes contains a large horizontal section close to @xmath44 ) and then this mesh smoothly transforms to the `` run away '' behaviour for @xmath45 .",
    "the `` atomic poisson '' mesh",
    "@xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) allows obtaining more precise results for atoms at reasonable values of @xmath48 due to a more dense distribution of nodes near the origin .",
    "in fact , this formula provides three different types of behaviour in three different domains : ( a ) a uniform mesh in a small vicinity of @xmath44 .",
    "this behaviour provides absence of irregularities in the finite - difference representation of the hamiltonian .",
    "( b ) @xmath49 - the quadratic expansion of the mesh .",
    "( c ) @xmath35 as @xmath26 .",
    "the distribution of nodes for not too big distances from the origin ( b ) given by the simple formula ( [ eq : atpoiss ] ) is similar to well known `` lagrange meshes '' for atoms and provide similar precision of results .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite for a definition of the `` laguerre mesh '' ( a mesh with nodes at zeros of the laguerre polynomials ) as a `` lagrange mesh '' suitable for systems with the coulomb potential and @xcite ( 22.16.8 ) for approximate formulas for the zeros of the laguerre polynomials ) .",
    "the overall precision of our results depends , of course , on the number of mesh nodes and , if necessary , can be improved in calculations with denser meshes .",
    "the most dense meshes which we could use in the present calculations had @xmath50 nodes . in most cases",
    "richardson s sequences of meshes with maximal number @xmath51 or @xmath52 were sufficient .",
    "in this section we provide some qualitative considerations on the problem of the ground states of multi - electron atoms in the high field limit . these considerations along with the well known electronic structure of the ground states at @xmath15 present a starting point for the combined qualitative and numerical considerations given in the following section . at very high field strengths the nuclear attraction energies and hf potentials ( which determine the motion along the @xmath8 axis ) are small compared to the interaction energies with the magnetic field ( which determines the motion perpendicular to the magnetic field and is responsible for the landau zone structure of the spectrum ) .",
    "thus in the limit ( @xmath54 ) , all the one - electron wave functions of the ground state belong to the lowest landau zones , i.e. @xmath55 for all the electrons , and the system must be fully spin - polarised , i.e. @xmath56 . for the coulomb central field the one electron levels form quasi 1d coulomb series with the binding energy @xmath57 for @xmath58 , whereas @xmath59 for @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the number of nodal surfaces of the wave function crossing the @xmath8 axis . in the limit",
    "@xmath62 the ground state wave function must be formed of the tightly bound single - electron functions with @xmath60 .",
    "the one - particle binding energies of these functions decrease as @xmath63 increases and , thus , the electrons must occupy orbitals with increasing @xmath63 starting with @xmath64 .    in the language of the hartree - fock approximation",
    "the ground state wave function of an atom in the high - field limit is a fully spin - polarised set of single - electron orbitals with no nodal surfaces crossing the @xmath8 axis and with non - positive magnetic quantum numbers decreasing from @xmath64 to @xmath65 , where @xmath37 is the number of electrons . in result , we have for the first 10 atoms and positive ions in the limit @xmath53 the following structure of ground state configurations which is a simple substitute of the periodic law at very strong magnetic fields    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < ,",

    "the minima in these curves give the equilibrium internuclear distances , presented in this figure ( right ) as a function of the electric field strength .",
