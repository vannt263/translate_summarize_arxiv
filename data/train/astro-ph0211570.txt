    "observations of resolved circumstellar disks around young stars are very important for our understanding of the formation of solar - type stars and planetary systems .",
    "usually the large difference of brightness between the central star and its circumstellar material does not allow direct imaging of the circumstellar disk .",
    "however when the disk midplane is seen close to edge - on , models predict that the direct light of the star is blocked out while a small amount of the light is scattered by the grains below and above the disk midplane , producing a typical pattern of a dark lane between two reflection nebulae ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first young stellar object displaying this typical pattern , hh30irs in the taurus dark cloud , was imaged by the hst / wfpc2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "edge - on disks have since become accessible to ground - based nir observations thanks to adaptive optics or speckle imaging ( e.g. , observations of ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently new observations of edge - on disks were reported in one of the nearest star - forming regions , the @xmath0 ophiuchi dark cloud ( l1688 ; @xmath8pc ) , both by the vlt / isaac under 035-seeing conditions ( @xcite ) and the hst / nicmos ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these disks are all located in the dense cores of this dark cloud and are deeply embedded  ( fig .",
    "[ chart ] ) .    during the period april 47 2001",
    ", five deep nir pointings were obtained with the ntt / sofi in the @xmath0 ophiuchi star - forming region ( grosso et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , as follow - up of x - ray observations made with chandra and xmm - newton .",
    "@xcite already reported the serendipitous discovery of new embedded herbig - haro objects in one of these pointings .",
    "we focus here on another pointing at the periphery of the @xmath0 ophiuchi dark cloud ( fig .  [ chart ] ) where we have discovered a new resolved edge - on circumstellar dust disk .",
    "we present in @xmath9[section_obs ] the ntt / sofi data and the follow - up observation made with the vlt / isaac ( unit telescope 1 ; _ antu _ ) unveiling the shape of this object .",

    "we introduce in @xmath9[section_color ] the pixel nir color mapping of the two nebulae . in @xmath9[section_model ] axisymmetric models are used to estimate the physical parameters of this disk , and to predict nir colors .",
    "finally in @xmath9[section_discussion ] we discuss the possible origin of the peculiar nir color properties of this object .",
    "this observation was made during the night of april 7 at airmass 1.0 , with the large sofi field ( @xmath10 ; pixel size = 0292 ) to survey the largest area .",
    "we took 60s - exposure frames using 10s detector sub - integration time to avoid detector non - linearity and saturation . between each frames",
    "the telescope was moved inside a 20-width box centered on the target position , according to a random pattern of offsets automatically determined by the imaging mode called auto jitter .",
    "the net exposure times are 24min in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath5 , leading to a @xmath5@xmath619mag completeness magnitude for point sources .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the eso s eclipse package ( version 3.8.1 ) which provides the jitter command .",
    "the best seeing conditions of this ntt / sofi pointing were achieved during the @xmath5 exposure with full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath607 .",
    "the astrometric registration of the reduced images was made using the position of a @xmath5=14.1mag star ( 2massi1628133 - 243127 ; @xcite ) located only 12  to the north of our object , extracted using sextractor ( @xcite ) . @xmath1 and @xmath2 images were then resampled to match the @xmath5 image using the warping command of eclipse with the hyperbolic tangent interpolation kernel .    figure  [ image].a shows the resulting color composite image centered on 2massi1628137 - 243139 which went unnoticed until now .",
    "compared to the unresolved field stars , this source appears extended .",
    "one can barely see two characteristic reflection nebulae , and a marginally resolved dark dust lane oriented east - west in front of the star . to confirm this detection and to measure the physical parameters of this disk ,",
    "we need a deeper and higher angular resolution image .",
    "this can easily be achieved with the vlt - ut1/isaac , by combining better seeing conditions with better sensitivity and image sampling .",
    "we obtained for this goal one hour of the eso director s discretionary time .",
    "the observation was carried out in service mode , triggered by very good seeing conditions ( fwhm@xmath604 ) on august 15 , 2001 .",
    "the auto jitter imaging mode was also used with 80s , 60s , 60s - exposure frames and 40s , 15s , 10s detector sub - integration time for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "net exposure times were 10min in @xmath5 and @xmath2 , and 10.7min in @xmath1 , with airmass ranges from 1.05 to 1.11 .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the version 4.1.0 of eclipse .",
    "we used the is_ghost command to remove the electrical ghosts induced by a bright star in the field of view .",
    "the photometric calibration is based on the observation of the ir standard star 9181/s243-e ( @xcite ) provided by the service mode , and taking into account average ir atmospheric extinction on paranal ( 0.11 , 0.06 , and 0.07magairmass@xmath11 for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath5 , respectively ) .",

    "thanks to very good seeing conditions and smaller detector pixel size , the two reflection nebulae are unveiled , and the dark dust lane is now clearly resolved in all three filters .",
    "the shape of this object seen nearly edge - on and appearing on a starry background has led us to nickname it the _ flying saucer _ ( hereafter the fs ) .",
    "two sources are visible within 2  ( 280au at 140pc ) of this disk both in the ntt and the vlt images .",

    "the second source , thanks to its location close to the south - north disk axis , could be a jet h@xmath13 knot candidate , although no counter knot is visible .",
    "several objects with similar colors and brightnesses are also spread over the field of view , which allows us to interpret this second source also as a background source .",
    "figure  [ brightness ] presents the surface brightness maps of the vlt data in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath5-band , respectively , with contours obtained without any smoothing with the interactive data language ( idl ) .",
    "we define the dark lane axis as the bisector of the line segment defined by the nebula peaks in the @xmath5 image .",
    "the orientation of the dark lane is strictly east - west , and separates the northern and southern reflection nebulae .",
    "the southern nebula is slightly asymmetric , with a larger extension towards the east . in @xmath1",
    "the southern nebula is more extended than its northern counterpart , and the southern peak is 1.7 times brighter than the northern one .",
    "this implies that we are not seeing the fs exactly edge - on .",
    "indeed the scattered light models of accretion disks versus inclination show that when one looks above the disk midplane , the brightness of the upper reflection nebula increases compared to the brightness of the lower reflection nebula ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we are therefore seeing the fs slightly below its disk midplane , corresponding to the southern nebula .",
    "the difference between the northern and the southern reflection nebula decreases with increasing wavelength , leading to a more symmetric reflection nebulae in @xmath5 . in this filter",
    "the northern nebula is still slightly less extended , but its peak brightness is 1.3 times brighter than the southern nebula .",
    "this produces the reddish aspect of the northern nebula visible in fig .",

    "this resolved circumstellar disk has a radius of 2.15  ( 300au at 140pc ) , as measured from the largest extension of the southern nebula ( contour 20.4magarcsec@xmath14 in @xmath1 ) , and a width of 1.2  ( 170au at 140pc ) .",

    "the resulting @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath5 integrated magnitudes are listed in table  [ photometry ] .",
    "these values are consistent with the values given for 2massi1628137 - 243139 in @xcite , taking into account the photometry uncertainties .",
    "this implies no dramatic change in the brightness of this disk on @xmath63years timescale .",
    "however this does not exclude very large changes over a few days like those seen in hh30irs ( @xcite ) .",
    "we list also in table  [ photometry ] existing complementary integrated magnitudes from other broad - band optical / nir filters . using the absolute calibration given by @xcite",
    ", we obtain the corresponding spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from optical to nir presented in fig .",
    "this disk was not detected in the mid - infrared ( mir ) by the isocam survey although located in low - noise region of this survey ( @xcite ; 6 and 10.5mjy upper limits for 6.7 and 14.3@xmath21 m , respectively , corresponding to the central wavelength of the isocam filters lw2 and lw3 ) .",
    "indeed for edge - on inclinations , all the material of the disk midplane is on the line of sight leading to an optically thick medium in the mir ; continuum emission from the warm inner disk needs deeper exposure times to be detected ( see e.g. , isocam mir spectrum of hh30irs ; @xcite ) . the sed shape , rising in the optical and reaching a peak in @xmath2 , is similar to that of hh30irs ( optical variability from @xcite ; nir from @xcite ;",
    "mid - infrared to millimetric from @xcite and references therein ) , and consistent with edge - on disk models ( e.g. @xcite ; see also below  [ section_sed_models ] ) .",

    "[ section_model ] .",
    "to estimate the foreground visual extinction of our object , @xmath22 , we have to deredden its integrated nir colors , derived from the integrated magnitudes established in the previous section .",
    "@xcite observed in taurus - auriga that _ dereddened _ classical t  tauri stars ( ctts ) follow a narrow segment locus in a @xmath23 color - color diagram .",
    "we adopt this locus as statistically representative of the ctts colors .",
    "we stress that an estimate of @xmath22 based on these typical ctts colors is however only indicative because the nir light of the fs is almost purely scattered",
    ". its color might then be quite different from that of a typical ctts in which one primarily sees direct light from the stellar photosphere and the inner disk . the color transformation of the ctts color locus from the cit to the 2mass photometric system using @xcite leads to : @xmath24 @xcite used the extinction law from @xcite , without taking into account its uncertainties , to deredden their ctts sample . to be consistent with their results",
    "we take the same extinction law transformed to the 2mass photometric system : @xmath25 @xmath26 which leads to @xmath27 . straightforward algebra with formulae [ eq : locus][eq : extinction_law ]",
    "using the observed nir colors ( @xmath28mag , @xmath29mag ) , and combining the quoted uncertainties , gives @xmath22=2.1@xmath202.6mag ( see fig .  [ color ] ) .    in order to obtain an upper limit on the foreground visual extinction of the fs , we computed the extinction map of the area around it by applying the `` near infrared color - excess '' ( nice ) method ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we extracted with sextractor ( @xcite ) sources with signal - to - noise greater than 5 in the three filters . to compute this map we selected only sources with stellarity indexes greater than 0.95 (",
    "other sources were considered as galaxies ) .",
    "because there were no observations of the unreddened background stellar field ( necessary for the determination of the zero point of the extinction scale ) , we must adopt a @xmath30 color for this background .",
    "@xcite found @xmath31mag towards a complex region in cygnus , essentially at the galactic plane , while @xcite found @xmath32mag towards a clean line - of - sight towards the galactic bulge , at @xmath33 .",
    "the stellar background towards the ophiuchus complex is probably even better behaved , because it lies at @xmath34 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath30 color of the north galactic pole from 2mass data is also @xmath350.12mag ( m. lombardi , private communication ) , so we decided to adopt this as the mean ophiuchus background color .",
    "we show our extinction map in fig .",
    "[ extinction_map ] .",
    "the spatial resolution of the map is 20 , and the visual extinction ranges from 5 to 7mag .",
    "the extinction increases from east to west , i.e.  towards the molecular core ( see fig .  [ chart ] ) , hence tracing the presence of material related with the main cloud .",
    "this extinction map leads to the following upper limit on the foreground extinction of the fs : @xmath36mag .",
    "our previous estimate based on the ctts colors , @xmath22=2.1@xmath202.6mag , is consistent with this upper limit , and might imply that the fs is located within this peripherical material , which is not unreasonable .",
    "we adopt this extinction value as our best guess .",
    "thanks to its location at the periphery of the dense cores , this disk suffers less foreground extinction than the other disks already found in this star - forming region .",
    "this is also visible in fig .",
    "[ sed ] where its sed shows only a slow rise at short wavelength in contrast to the steep rise of crbr2422.8 - 3423 due to the high extinction of dense cores ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found a comparable foreground visual extinction for hh30irs ( @xmath37mag ) assuming a typical stellar type m0 for the central star .",
    "since the fs suffers no background emission from the dense cores , it is an ideal laboratory for the study of both dust and gas in circumstellar disks .",
    "we noted in the previous section the reddish appearance of the northern reflexion nebula of the fs , appearing in fig .",
    "[ image ] . to our knowledge",
    "such a nir color difference between the reflexion nebulae of an edge - on disk has never been observed .",
    "nir adaptive optics images of hk  tau / c display only a `` slight change in the nebula s appearance between @xmath1 and @xmath38 '' ( @xcite ) ; speckle imaging shows that the flux ratio between the two nebulae increases from 5 at @xmath1 to 8 at @xmath38 ( @xcite ) . to do a spatially resolved quantitative study of the nir color differences between the two nebulae of the fs",
    ", we introduce a new nir data visualization method called `` pixel nir color mapping '' , picmap for short .",
    "although in this paper we apply it to the nir photometry of the fs , this method is general and could conceivably be applied to other photometric bands and adapted to other spatially resolved objects .",
    "the central idea is the following .",
    "we want to visualize directly in a single vlt image the @xmath39 and @xmath40 colors of each pixel of the fs .",
    "we start by selecting the pixels of the fs located inside the boundary of the aperture photometry defined in  [ section_photometry ] ( see the upper left - panel of fig .  [ color ] ) , and by computing their @xmath39 and @xmath40 colors from the @xmath41 and @xmath5 brightness maps of fig .",
    "[ brightness ] .",
    "then we plot this set of @xmath39 and @xmath40 colors in a @xmath42 color - color diagram , much in the way the nir colors of individual stars in an association would be plotted . by analogy",
    ", we also plot in this diagram the standard ism reddening vector .",
    "the upper right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ color ] illustrates the main result : most of the pixels in the @xmath42 diagram are found to be spread roughly along the reddening vector .",
    "therefore , we use its direction to build an arbitrary color palette , shown to the right of the diagram .",
    "the last step of the method is then to create a mapping , both on the @xmath43 diagram and on the vlt image , by `` coding '' the color of each fs pixel according to its projection on this color palette . in other words , picmap defines a correspondence between the @xmath43 plane and the vlt image . as we shall see , this visualization method is powerful to detect any unusual trend in nir colors within the fs image .",
    "physically , we could interpret the pixel color palette used in the picmap as a visualization of the nir colors of the nebula pixels in terms of pure extinction by interstellar medium type dust grains .",
    "we caution however that the grains in the disk may be grayer than interstellar medium type dust grains ( see  [ dust_grain ] ) , and the true extinction along a line - of - sight through the nebulae is then likely considerably higher than the standard extinction derived from this simple ism extinction law . in reality , the nir colors of the fs result from a complex combination of extinction and scattering by disk grains , which can only be reproduced by modelling the radiative transfer of the stellar light through the dust , as discussed in the next section .",
    "however the picmap can be used to quantify the relative difference of nir colors between the two reflection nebulae in term of standard ism extinction .    in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ color ] when one moves in the vlt image from the edge of the southern nebula to the dark lane along the vertical axis of the disk , the corresponding nir colors in the @xmath42 diagram ( white dots ) follow roughly the direction of the ism reddening vector , with an increase of @xmath64mag of standard extinction . the same amount of standard extinction is also visible for the nir colors of the pixels located between the edge of the northern nebula and the dark lane ( black dots )",
    "however the northern nebula suffers an extra standard extinction of @xmath63mag compared to the southern nebula . in the @xmath42 diagram",
    ", it is also clear that the nir colors are at a peak for many pixels of the northern nebula , and display what would be called a `` nir color excess '' in the case of young stars .",
    "the picmap method allows to locate them easily spatially on the vlt image .",
    "they are not distributed at random in the northern nebula , but form a ridge , 03 ( 40au at 140pc ) to the north of the dark lane and parallel to it .",
    "there is no similar feature in the southern nebula .    in spite of the fact that the fs disk is seen nearly edge - on ,",
    "it is clearly asymmetric with respect to the dark lane , the northern nebula being significantly redder than the southern nebula . in the next section , we will use axisymmetric disk models with radiative transfer , to look for a model parameter set that reproduces the observed nir color asymmetry .",
    "we will apply our picmap method to the scattered light model , to visualize the results and compare it with our observations .",
    "we adopt a axisymmetric density structure for the circumstellar material ( i.e. symmetric with the disk midplane ) , with dust grains that reproduce the images and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of hh30  irs , and perform the radiative transfer simulation using monte carlo techniques ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) to compare scattered light models with the high resolution vlt images . for calculating synthetic",

    "we adopt a axisymmetric flared disk structure in which the total density ( gas plus dust ) is : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the disk density extrapolated to the stellar surface ( we set @xmath46r@xmath47 ; see sed model  [ section_sed_models ] ) , @xmath48 is the radial coordinate in the disk midplane ( with @xmath49 ) , and the scale height increases with radius , @xmath50 .",

    "however , the vlt data show no variation of the width of the dust lane with the wavelength , and moreover as already noted in  [ section_photometry ] the northern nebula brightness relative to the southern nebula brightness _ increases_. a steeper grain size distribution and/or smaller maximum grain size may explain the absence of variation of the width of the dark lane at nir ( @xcite ) , but can not reproduce the brightening of the northern nebula .",
    "the determination of an adapted dust opacity law for this object is beyond the scope of this paper , and should be inferred using complementary observation made at longer wavelengths , more constraining for the dust size distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ color ] shows the resulting picmap for our model .",
    "we can see easily with this tool that the nir color distribution of the southern nebula along the reddening vector is quite well reproduced , however the nir color distribution of the two nebulae is nearly symmetric with the dark lane .",
    "we conclude that the _ axisymmetric _ disk model does not reproduce the asymmetry in the color spatial distribution observed in the scattered light of the fs .",
    "since the spectral type of the central star is unknown , we have assumed @xmath104k , and used the corresponding kurucz atmosphere model ( @xcite ) for the input stellar spectrum .",
    "as the envelope has a small mass compared to the disk mass , distributed throughout a much larger volume than the denser disk , we neglect it and we compute the synthetic emergent sed from our symmetric disk model only .",
    "we apply the foreground visual extinction estimated in  [ section_extinction ] using the analytical fits from optical to ir of the extinction cross - section given by @xcite , combined with the canonical relation between visual extinction and column density obtained by @xcite . adopting a source distance @xmath105pc we require that @xmath106l@xmath47 ( which corresponds to @xmath107r@xmath47 ) to reproduce both the optical and the nir fluxes ( fig .",
    "below 2@xmath21 the sed is dominated by the ( scattered ) light of star , while at longer wavelengths the emission from the disk dust grains dominates .",
    "varying the disk inclination from pole - on to edge - on reduces the flux because the disk midplane is optically thick in the mir .",
    "our sed simulation predicts 1020@xmath21 m fluxes of 0.71.8mjy , and 1.3 mm fluxes of 12.5mjy .",
    "the spatial study of circumstellar disk is usually based only on surface brightness maps as in fig .",
    "[ brightness ] .",
    "thanks to the high spatial resolution achieved with our vlt nir observations ( 04-seeing images ) , we have been able to make a spatial study of the nir colors of the individual pixels of the two resolved reflection nebulae of this nearly edge - on disk .",
    "we introduced in this paper a new nir data visualization called `` pixel nir color mapping '' ( picmap for short ) , to visualize directly the nir colors of the nebula pixels .",
    "this is a power tool to identify and localize any unusual nir color trend in the reflection nebulae .",
    "we have found with it a nir color excess and an extra standard extinction in the northern reflection nebula .",
    "fitting the images and the sed with axisymmetric disk model leads to model parameters consistent with what would be expected for a typical ctts , but can not reproduce the observed nir colors .",
    "it is necessary to introduce a source of asymmetry in our axisymmetric modelling .",
    "we use in our model a uniformly bright star .",
    "there could be cool or dark spots on the star that will change the illumination pattern and consequently the brightening of the northern nebula .",
    "stellar hotspot models produce a typical lighthouse effect , which has been proposed to explain the observed brightening and dimming of the reflection nebulae in hh30irs ( @xcite ) .",
    "however such a phenomenon should produce changes at least on a stellar rotation period ( @xmath6few days ) , it is thus unlikely to be observed at the same phase on a 130day time interval .",
    "we could have an embedded shock associated with a micro - jet , which could emit h@xmath13 lines producing the brightening in @xmath2 and @xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however there is no evidence in this object of h@xmath13 emission knots outside the nebulae .",
    "this micro - jet hypothesis in the northern nebula can be easily tested with nir spectroscopy and narrow band filter imaging .",
    "we could account for the lower brightness of the northern nebula at short wavelengths and its redder infrared color as due to @xmath108mag of localized foreground extinction . from the color - color diagram of the model image",
    "( see lower right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ color ] ) , we note that adding an extra extinction of @xmath108mag only in front of the northern nebula reproduces the observed range of @xmath39 colors .",
    "however this localized foreground extinction is not visible in our extinction map ( fig .",
    "[ extinction_map ] ) . adding @xmath108mag foreground extinction only above the dark lane can only be an ad hoc solution .",
    "a more natural way to explain these differences would be to introduce an extra self - absorption , possibly due to a large - scale disk warp .",
    "for instance @xcite have detected the millimeter range the presence of a symmetric 20@xmath109 warp beyond 120au in an @xmath110au - radius edge - on disk .",
    "if a such large - scale disk warp is seen in front of the central star , it could strongly affect the scattered light .",
    "scattered light models of warped disks are now needed to obtain quantitative predictions .",
    "this idea would be fruitful to test in detail , as a large - scale disk warp may be excited by a planet on an inclined orbit ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we stress that our axisymmetric model assumes that the dust and gas are well mixed , it does not take into account the settling of the larger grains in the disk midplane .",
    "moreover , having no observational constraints at longer wavelengths , we use conservatively a gas plus dust mixture that reproduces the images and sed of hh30  irs .",
    "other grain properties combined with dust settling might possibly account for some of the observed color gradient .    in summary",
    ", while we can reproduce many of the features of the fs using a symmetric disk plus envelope , our models should be extended to include non - symmetric geometries , specific dust properties , and dust settling , to explain the shortcomings of the model we have presented .",
    "the picmap method introduced in this paper is a power tool to compare the predictions of these improved models with the strong spatial constraints brought by our observations .",
    "a more extensive coverage of the sed of the fs from nir to mir and millimetric , combining ground and space observations ( e.g. , hst , vlt / naco - lgs , sirtf , plateau de bure interferometer ) , will further help to constrain the dust properties ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and the disk structure of this object .",
    "we would like to thank the referee , chris koresko , for having delivered rapidly his report , and for suggestions and comments that improved the final manuscript .",
    "we also thank the director of eso , catherine cesarsky , who gave us a part of her discretionary time to carry out this work , the anonymous observer who triggered the vlt service mode observation , and anne dutrey , franois mnard , and barbara whitney for useful discussions .",
