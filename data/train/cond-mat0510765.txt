    "when a nanowire is attached to two electron reservoirs with different chemical potentials , the electric current flows through it .",
    "studies of the electrical conductance at the nanoscale have resulted in discoveries of interesting physical effects , which include conductance quantization , molecular rectification , negative differential resistance , hysteresis , oscillatory length - dependence of the conductance.@xcite these and other unusual and potentially useful properties make nanowires promising candidates for creating various electronic nanodevices.@xcite    electrical conduction in nanowires can be approximated under certain conditions as a ballistic scattering of electrons along the one - dimensional quasiperiodic superlattice of finite length . since the first fabrication of quasi - periodic @xmath0 multilayer structure,@xcite propagation of elementary excitations ( electrons , photons , polaritons , spin waves ) through one - dimensional fractal structures has been extensively studied.@xcite it has been demonstrated , in particularly , that the quasi - periodic structure of the medium manifests itself in the self - similarity of the transmission.@xcite the landauer conductance of the generalized thue - morse and fibonacci one - dimensional lattices has also been investigated.@xcite in addition , the fractal conductance fluctuations have been predicted and measured in two - dimensional electronic billiards in magnetic fields.@xcite if the system has a quasiperiodic structure and consists of a number of identical or similar scattering blocks , the transmission through a single block can be mapped into the transmission through the entire system .",
    "this is the central idea behind several powerful approaches to the calculation of transmission through quasiperodic structures , those like transfer matrix @xcite and dyson - equation.@xcite the aim of our paper is to explore the possibility of the self - similarity for single - channel transmission for electron transport in nanowires .",
    "we demonstrate that a single - channel transmission in the resonance scattering regime exhibits self - similarity as a function of the incident electron energy and the nanowire length .",
    "we use one - dimensional tight - binding model with nearest - neighbor hopping and landauer theory to explain the self - similarity of the transmission coefficient for electron transport in nanowires . based upon resonance condition for the transmission , we derive analytical formulas for nonlinear continuous transformation of the wire length and the energy of the transmitted electrons .",
    "the transformation preserves the number of transmission maxima by deforming initial region on the energy  wire length plane .",
    "we confirm the existence of the self - similarity by numerical calculation of the transmission for various wire lengths , as well as by comparison with the first principle transport calculations for sodium wires .",
    "to describe a nanowire of length @xmath1 , we adopt the standard tight - binding model with the nearest neighbor constant hopping rate @xmath2 and the site energy @xmath3 .",
    "the system hamiltonian is thus described by the three - diagonal @xmath4 matrix : @xmath5 . \\label{h}\\ ] ] the interaction between the wire and the leads is not considered explicitly and is accounted for by the introduction of the self - energy matrix , @xmath6 , into the wire green s function , @xmath7^{-1}.\\label{gr}\\ ] ] assuming that the molecule is connected to the left ( right ) lead through its @xmath8th sites , the transmission is determined by the @xmath9 element of the green s function ( [ gr]):@xcite    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the imaginary part of the self - energy function @xmath12 the conductance at low temperature and small voltage is given ( in units of @xmath13 ) by the landauer formula @xmath14 @xmath15 being the fermi - energy of the electrodes .",
    "the matrix element of the molecular green s function @xmath16 can be analytically computed for our model hamiltonian.@xcite to simplify the presentation , we define the self - energy within the broadband approximation assuming that @xmath17 in eq.([self ] ) and considering @xmath18 as an energy - independent constant.@xcite the assumption can be relaxed and its consequences are discussed later .",
    "the analytical calculations yield the following expression for the transmission:@xcite    @xmath19    where we have introduced the dimensionless quantities @xmath20    if @xmath21 , then the trigonometric function in eqs.([tg],[par ] ) are transformed into the corresponding hyperbolic functions .",
    "this results in the exponential scaling of the transmission with the nanowire length @xmath1.@xcite if @xmath22 , then eq.([tg ] ) describes the resonance tunneling regime where the transmission oscillates as a function of the nanowire length @xmath1 .",
    "oscillatory regime is the intrinsic property of the single channel atomic nanowires such as au and na,@xcite to which the one - dimensional tight - binding hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is applicable .",
    "therefore we restrict our consideration to this regime and demonstrate that the transmission exhibits scaling and self - similarity .",
    "suppose that the coupling between the wire and the lead is weak , i.e. @xmath23 . the transmission @xmath24 is very small for @xmath25 unless @xmath26 in the denominator of eq.([tg ] ) tends to zero .",
    "if we put @xmath27 , which is equivalent to assuming that @xmath28 then the transmission achieves its maximum @xmath29 for any given length of the wire there are @xmath1 different resonances ( [ tmax ] ) in the transmission .",
    "the resonance label @xmath30 in eqs.([res ] ) , ( [ tmax ] ) can be interpreted as the number of the transmission maxima achieved for the given molecular length @xmath1 within the energy interval @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "the resonance condition ( [ res ] ) suggests the existence of the self - similarity of the transmission @xmath32 as we vary the nanowire length @xmath1 and energy @xmath33 of transmitted electrons .",
    "indeed , the following simple linear transformation @xmath34 @xmath35 leaves the resonance condition ( [ res ] ) unaffected , thereby preserving the number of resonances of the transmission by deforming the energy interval .",
    "the mapping parameter @xmath36 is not , in general , an integral but a rational number .",
    "if the angles @xmath37 and @xmath38 are expressed explicitly in terms of the corresponding energies @xmath33 and @xmath39 via eq.([par ] ) , then the transformation ( [ maptet ] ) becomes nonlinear : @xmath40 the transformation ( [ mapn ] ) , ( [ mape ] ) leads to the self - similarity of transmission at @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] energy intervals : the wire of the length @xmath43 within the interval @xmath41 $ ] has exactly the same number @xmath30 of the transmission maxima as the wire of the length @xmath1 within the interval @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , consider the transmission @xmath32 of a wire of the length @xmath1 when the energy of incident electrons varies within the range @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath32 can be mapped into @xmath45 for any @xmath46 within the window @xmath47 $ ] , provided that @xmath48 is defined via eq .",
    "( [ mapn ] ) .",
    "the number and positions of the conductance peaks ( [ res ] ) for @xmath32 within @xmath44 $ ] will be exactly the same as that of @xmath45 within @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "we confirm the existence of the self - similarity of a single - channel transmission by numerical calculations via eq.([tg ] ) .",
    "the computations are performed for @xmath49 ev , @xmath50 ev and @xmath51 .",
    "several illustrative results are presented in fig.1 for rational mapping parameters @xmath48 .",
    "the transmission @xmath32 is computed within the energy windows calculated as prescribed by eqs.([mapn ] ) and ( [ mape ] ) .",
    "the transmissions for @xmath52 and @xmath53 exhibit almost perfect self - similarity .",
    "note that the scale of the vertical axes in the figures is not the same .",
    "this means that the transmission curves should be additionally stretched in order to make a perfect match between them .",
    "1 shows that the widths of the peaks are broader for shorter nanowires .",
    "this has the following explanation .",
    "if we expand transmission ( [ tg ] ) in the vicinity of @xmath54 and retain the leading on @xmath55 and @xmath56 contributions , we obtain : @xmath57^{2}}\\label{shape}\\ ] ] thus , the higher is @xmath1 and/or @xmath30 , the narrower is the lorentzian peak - shape ( [ shape ] ) .",
    "the procedure described above opens the possibility of two - dimensional continuation of transmission on the @xmath58 plane .",
    "the transmission @xmath32 in the rectangular domain @xmath59 $ ] , @xmath60 $ ] can be mapped into that of the domain @xmath61 $ ] , @xmath62 $ ] via the transformation ( [ mapn ] , [ mape ] ) .",
    "most tight - binding and first principle transport calculations relay on the nonorthogonal atomic basis functions to compute the wire green s functions.@xcite within the non - orthogonal representation the landauer formula ( [ t ] ) remains valid , but the definition of the green s function ( [ gr ] ) should be modified according to @xmath63^{-1 } , \\label{grs}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the overlap matrix .",
    "if we assume that only the nearest - neighbor basis functions overlap significantly , then the matrix @xmath64 reduces to the three - diagonal form : @xmath65 , \\label{s}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the overlap integral between the nearest neighbor basis functions . in this case",
    ", the expression for the transmission ( [ tg ] ) remains correct if the parameter @xmath37 is redefined : @xmath67 therefore , the non - orthogonality of the basis functions breaks the mirror symmetry of @xmath32 with respect to the sign of the site energy @xmath3 , and different choices of the site energy @xmath3 are no longer equivalent .",
    "having adopted new definition ( [ pars ] ) for the parameter @xmath37 , we observe that the self - similarity transformation ( [ mapn ] , [ maptet ] ) remains unchanged .",
    "the counterpart of the transformation ( [ mape ] ) in the energy domain should be modified to account for the basis nonorthogonality : @xmath68 if @xmath69 , then the transformations ( [ mape ] ) and ( [ mapes ] ) coincide , evidently . if @xmath70 , the non - orthogonality of the basis functions causes , through the ( energy - dependent ) scaling factor @xmath71 , an additional stretching ( shrinking ) in the energy space , depending on whether the product @xmath72 is negative ( positive ) . for example , if we assume that the overlap parameter @xmath73 and plot the transmissions analogies to those in fig . 1",
    ", we obtain exactly the same curves .",
    "however , according to eqs.([mapn ] ) and ( [ mapes ] ) , the energy intervals will shrink ( we use ev units for energy @xmath33 ) : @xmath74 for @xmath75 , @xmath76 for @xmath77 , and @xmath78 for @xmath79 . on the contrary ,",
    "if we put @xmath80 ( this is equivalent to the consideration of @xmath81 for @xmath73 ) and plot the same transmissions , the corresponding energy intervals will stretch as compared with those in fig . 1 :",
    "@xmath82 for @xmath75 , @xmath83 for @xmath77 , and @xmath84 for @xmath79 .      in this section ,",
    "we examine the prediction of transmission self - similarity by performing the first principle simulations of transport properties of na atomic wires .",
    "the calculations were performed using our plane wave / pseudopotential implementation of the density functional based non - equilibrium green s function techniques in the cpmd package.@xcite our implementation is based on nonorthogonal wannier - type atomic orbitals.@xcite all systems were treated employing periodic boundary conditions and the kohn - sham orbitals were expanded in plane waves ( 50 ry cutoff ) at the @xmath85 point of the brillouin zone .",
    "we used local density approximation for the exchange - correlation functional and stumpf , gonze , and schettler pseudopotentials@xcite for core electrons .",
    "the system is treated as a `` supermolecule '' placed in a large supercell .",
    "the size of supercell is chosen in such a way that the distance between the nearest atoms in the neighboring cells is larger than 8.5 , so that the interaction between supercell images is negligible .",
    "the whole system is divided into three parts : left electrode , central wire , and right electrode .",
    "the electrode part is obtained by cutting a few atoms from na ( 001 ) surface .",
    "the geometry of the electrodes is fixed to the bulk values .",
    "the wire part is a single chain of na atoms , where the distance between the atoms is constrained to the nearest neighbor distance in the bulk system .",
    "the distance between the electrode part and the wire part is optimized .",
    "the results of our first principle transport calculations are illustrated by figs .",
    "2a and 2b depict the transmission calculated for na nanowire with @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively . figs .",
    "2c and 2d show zoomed portions of figs .",
    "2a and 2b , which are seen to exhibit quite a good resemblance .    to link these calculations to the theory developed in the paper ,",
    "the parameters of the tight - binding molecular hamiltonian @xmath88 , the self - energy matrix @xmath6 and the overlap matrix @xmath64 were extracted from the first principle transport calculations .",
    "since we use nonorthogonal basis set , the green s function should be taken in the form ( [ grs ] ) which accounts for the overlap matrix @xmath64 between wannier type atomic orbitals .",
    "the calculated molecular hamiltonian and overlap matrix are described fairly well by the three - diagonal matrices ( [ h ] ) and ( [ s ] ) , respectively , with the parameters @xmath89 ev , @xmath90 ev , and @xmath91 .",
    "if we insert these parameters into eqs .",
    "( [ mapn ] ) and ( [ mapes ] ) , then the energy window @xmath92 $ ] for @xmath86 will be mapped into @xmath93 $ ] for @xmath94 .",
    "this correlates reasonably well with the actual window @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "of course , the calculated @xmath88 and @xmath64 matrices comply with simple three - diagonal formulas ( [ h ] ) and ( [ s ] ) only approximately , and the actual self - energy function @xmath96 is neither purely imaginary , nor energy independent .",
    "evidently , the presence of @xmath97 causes an additional shift of transmission maxima , and @xmath98 brings an additional energy dependence of @xmath32 which has not been taken into account within the present theoretical analyses .",
    "if , however , @xmath98 does not change significantly within the interval@xmath59 $ ] , then the self - similarity in @xmath32 should be preserved , as is proven by figs . 2c and 2d .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated that a single - channel transmission for electron transport in nanowires exhibits the self - similarity in resonance tunneling regime . starting from the resonance condition , we proposed the transformation of the wire length and the incident electron energy , which preserves the number of maxima in the transmission .",
    "a sample calculations on one - dimensional tight binding model produces exact agreement with analytical results .",
    "the density functional based transport calculations of na atomic wires confirm the existence of self - similarity in the transmission for realistic system .",
    "the existence of scaling properties and self - similarity of the molecular transmission is also supported by a possibility to define it via the friedel sum rule @xcite .",
    "it is not necessary to have a detailed information on a large variety of the parameters describing the molecule and the leads to predict transport properties of a single channel conductor . to compute the single - channel conductance by the friedel sum rule , it is sufficient to know only the difference between the number of electrons occupying the even and the odd eigenstates of the molecule .",
    "it is thus not very unrealistic to suggest that the self - similarity in molecular transmission and conductance may be a rather general phenomenon . in terms of possible applications",
    ", our results suggest that the transmission , computed within a certain energy and length window , can be transferred to other windows via the transformation ( [ mapn ] ) , ( [ mape ] ) , ( [ mapes ] ) .",
    "for example , the transmission of a short wire within a relatively wide energy window can be mapped into the transmission of a longer wire within a narrower energy window .",
    "if we assume , additionally , that the site energy @xmath3 can be purposefully modified,@xcite then the molecular conductance @xmath99 , eq.([g ] ) , becomes a function of the ( modified ) site energy @xmath3 and molecular length @xmath1 and also exhibits the self - similarity .",
