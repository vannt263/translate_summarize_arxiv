    "nuclear lattice effective field theory ( nleft ) is a first - principles approach , in which chiral eft for nucleons is combined with numerical auxiliary - field quantum monte carlo ( afqmc ) lattice calculations .",
    "nleft differs from other _ ab initio _",
    "methods  @xcite in that it is an unconstrained monte carlo calculation , which does not rely on truncated basis expansions or many - body perturbation theory , nor on prior information about the structure of the nuclear wave function .    as in chiral eft ,",
    "our calculations are organized in powers of a generic soft scale @xmath5 associated with factors of momenta and the pion mass  @xcite .",
    "we denote @xmath6 as leading order ( lo ) , @xmath7 as next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , and @xmath8 as next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) contributions .",
    "the present calculations are performed up to nnlo .",
    "we define @xmath9 as the lo lattice hamiltonian , and @xmath10 as the equivalent hamiltonian with the pion - nucleon coupling @xmath11 and contact interactions that respect wigner s su(4 ) symmetry .    in our nleft calculations ,",
    "@xmath9 is treated non - perturbatively ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the nlo contribution to the two - nucleon force ( 2nf ) , the electromagnetic and strong isospin - breaking contributions ( emib ) , and the three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) which first enters at nnlo , are all treated as perturbations .",
    "it should be noted that our `` lo '' calculations use smeared short - range interactions that capture much of the corrections usually treated at nlo and higher orders  @xcite . at nnlo ,",
    "the 3nf overbinds nuclei with @xmath12 due to a clustering instability which involves four nucleons on the same lattice site .",
    "a long - term objective of nleft is to remedy this problem by decreasing the lattice spacing and including the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n3lo ) corrections in chiral eft . in the mean time , the overbinding problem has been rectified by means of a 4n contact interaction , tuned to the empirical binding energy of either @xmath13he or @xmath14be  @xcite . while this provides a good description of the alpha nuclei up to @xmath15 including the hoyle state  @xcite , the overbinding is found to increase more rapidly for @xmath16 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a non - local 4n interaction which accounts for all possible configurations of four nucleons on adjacent lattice sites was introduced , and adjusted to the empirical binding energy of @xmath3 mg .",
    "a detailed study of the spectrum and electromagnetic properties of @xmath1o ( with inclusion of the effective 4n interaction ) has been reported in ref .",
    "the hoyle state is a resonance with spin - parity quantum numbers @xmath17 in the spectrum of @xmath0c , which plays an important role in resonantly enhancing the reaction rate for the so - called triple - alpha process , which is responsible for the production of carbon in massive stars that have reached the red giant stage in their evolution .",
    "this reaction represents a significant bottleneck in the stellar nucleosynthesis , as @xmath14be is an unstable ( though relatively long - lived ) resonance .",
    "for @xmath0c to form , a third alpha particle must combine with the @xmath14be resonance to form the hoyle state , which subsequently decays electromagnetically to the ground state of @xmath0c .",
    "this reaction may then proceed further ( non - resonantly ) to form @xmath1o through addition of a fourth alpha particle .",
    "however , the temperature of the stellar plasma at which the triple - alpha process takes place depends exponentially on the energy @xmath18 of the hoyle state above the triple - alpha threshold , which is experimentally known to be @xmath19  kev .",
    "stellar model calculations  @xcite have shown that only a narrow window of @xmath20  kev exists in @xmath18 where sizable amounts of carbon and oxygen can be produced simultaneously .    .lattice results at leading order ( lo ) and available experimental values for the root - mean - square charge radii and quadrupole moments of the @xmath0c states .",
    "[ hoyle1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ oxygen2 ] , we note that the lo charge radius @xmath21 of the ground state of @xmath1o is smaller than the empirical value @xmath22 .",
    "this leads to a systematic deviation , which arises from the overall size of the second moment of the charge distribution . to compensate for this overall scaling mismatch",
    ", we have also calculated `` rescaled '' quantities multiplied by powers of the ratio @xmath23 , according to the length dimension of each observable . with such a scaling factor included , we find that the nleft predictions for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 transitions are in good agreement with available experimental values .",
    "we have presented an overview of the central nleft results for the low - lying even - parity spectra of @xmath0c and @xmath1o .",
    "this includes the hoyle state of @xmath0c which plays a central role in the stellar nucleosynthesis of life - essential elements .",
    "we have also shown that the electromagnetic properties and transition rates of @xmath0c and @xmath1o are in agreement with available experimental data .",
    "while the long - term objectives of nleft are to decrease the lattice spacing and include higher orders in the eft expansion , we also find that the missing physics up to @xmath4si can be approximated by an `` effective '' 4n interaction .",
    "these results represent an important step towards more comprehensive nleft calculations of medium - mass nuclei in the near future .",
