    "detection and further experimental reconfirmation of current cosmic acceleration pose to cosmology a fundamental task of identifying and revealing the cause of such phenomenon . in light of this cosmological models with spinor field",
    "being the source of gravitational field attracts widespread interest in recent time @xcite .",
    "it was shown that a suitable choice of spinor field nonlinearity + ( i ) accelerates the isotropization process @xcite ; + ( ii ) gives rise to a singularity - free universe @xcite and + ( iii ) generates late time acceleration @xcite .",
    "question that naturally pops up is , if the spinor field can redraw the picture of evolution caused by perfect fluid and dark energy , is it possible to simulate perfect fluid and dark energy by means of a spinor field ?",
    "affirmative answer to this question was given in the a number of papers @xcite .",
    "in those papers the authors have shown that different types of perfect fluid and dark energy can be described by nonlinear spinor field .",
    "in @xcite we used two types of nonlinearity , one occurs as a result of self - action and the other resulted from the interaction between the spinor and scalar field .",
    "it was shown that the case with induced nonlinearity is the partial one and can be derived from the case with self - action .",
    "in @xcite we give the description of generalized chaplygin gas and modified quintessence @xcite in terms of spinor field and study the evolution of the universe filled with nonlinear spinor field within the scope of a bianchi type - i cosmological model .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend that study within the scope of a isotropic and homogeneous frw cosmological model .",
    "in this section we simulate different types of perfect fluid and dark energy by means of a nonlinear spinor field .",
    "let us first write the spinor field lagrangian @xcite : @xmath0 - m{\\bar \\psi}\\psi + f , \\label{lspin}\\ ] ] where the nonlinear term @xmath1 describes the self - action of a spinor field and can be presented as some arbitrary functions of invariant generated from the real bilinear forms of a spinor field . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case when @xmath2 with @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the covariant derivative of spinor field : @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the spinor affine connection . varying with respect to @xmath7",
    "one finds the spinor field equations :    [ speq ] @xmath8    variation of with respect to metric function gives energy - momentum tensor for the spinor field @xmath9 where @xmath10 in account of spinor field equations and takes the form @xmath11    we consider the case when the spinor field depends on @xmath12 only . in this case for the components of energy - momentum tensor we find    @xmath13    a detailed study of nonlinear spinor field was carried out in @xcite . in",
    "what follows , exploiting the equation of states we find the concrete form of @xmath1 which describes various types of perfect fluid and dark energy .",
    "first of all let us note that one of the simplest and popular model of the universe is a homogeneous and isotropic one filled with a perfect fluid with the energy density @xmath14 and pressure @xmath15 obeying the barotropic equation of state @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a constant .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath17 describes perfect fluid from phantom to ekpyrotic matter , namely    [ zeta ] @xmath18    the barotropic model of perfect fluid is used to study the evolution of the universe .",
    "most recently the relation is exploited to generate a quintessence in order to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .    in order to describe the matter given by with a spinor field",
    "let us now substitute @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "thus , inserting @xmath14 and @xmath23 from and into we find @xmath24 with the solution @xmath25 here @xmath26 is an integration constant . inserting into we find that @xmath27 since energy density should be non - negative , we conclude that @xmath26 is a negative constant , i.e. , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being a positive constant .",
    "so finally we can write the components of the energy momentum tensor    @xmath30    as one sees , the energy density @xmath14 is always positive , while the pressure @xmath31 is positive for @xmath32 , i.e. , for usual fluid and negative for @xmath33 , i.e. for dark energy .",
    "in account of it the spinor field lagrangian now reads @xmath0 - \\nu s^{1+w } , \\label{lspin1}\\ ] ] thus a massless spinor field with the lagrangian describes perfect fluid from phantom to ekpyrotic matter . here",
    "the constant of integration @xmath29 can be viewed as constant of self - coupling .",
    "a detailed analysis of this study was given in @xcite .",
    "an alternative model for the dark energy density was used by kamenshchik _",
    "@xcite , where the authors suggested the use of some perfect fluid but obeying `` exotic '' equation of state .",
    "this type of matter is known as _ chaplygin gas_. the fate of density perturbations in a universe dominated by the chaplygin gas , which exhibit negative pressure was studied by fabris _",
    "_ @xcite . model with chaplygin gas was also studied in the refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us now generate a chaplygin gas by means of a spinor field .",
    "a chaplygin gas is usually described by a equation of state @xmath34 then in case of a massless spinor field for @xmath1 one finds @xmath35 with the solution @xmath36 on account of this for the components of energy momentum tensor we find    @xmath37    as was expected , we again get positive energy density and negative pressure .",
    "thus the spinor field lagrangian corresponding to a chaplygin gas reads @xmath0 - \\bigl(a + \\lambda s^{1+\\gamma}\\bigr)^{1/(1+\\gamma)}. \\label{lspin2}\\ ] ] setting @xmath38 we find the result obtained in @xcite .      finally , we simulate modified quintessence with a nonlinear spinor field .",
    "it should be noted that one of the problems that face models with dark energy is that of eternal acceleration . in order",
    "to get rid of that problem quintessence with a modified equation of state was proposed which is given by @xcite @xmath39 here @xmath40 some critical energy density .",
    "setting @xmath41 one obtains ordinary quintessence .",
    "it is well known that as the universe expands the ( dark ) energy density decreases . as a result ,",
    "being a linear negative function of energy density , the corresponding pressure begins to increase . in case of an ordinary quintessence",
    "the pressure is always negative , but for a modified quintessence as soon as @xmath42 becomes less than the critical one , the pressure becomes positive .    inserting @xmath14 and @xmath23 into we find @xmath43 with @xmath44 being a positive constant . on account of this for the components of energy momentum tensor we find",
    "@xmath45    we see that a nonlinear spinor field with specific type of nonlinearity can substitute perfect fluid and dark energy , thus give rise to a variety of evolution scenario of the universe .",
    "in the previous section we showed that the perfect fluid and the dark energy can be simulated by a nonlinear spinor field . in the section ii the nonlinearity was the subject to self - action .",
    "in @xcite we have also considered the case when the nonlinearity was induced by a scalar field .",
    "it was also shown the in our context the results for induced nonlinearity is some special cases those of self - interaction . taking it into mind we study the evolution an universe filled with a nonlinear spinor field given by the lagrangian , with the nonlinear term @xmath1 is given by , and .",
    "we consider the anisotropic universe given by the bianchi type - i ( bi ) space - time @xmath46 with @xmath47 being the functions of @xmath12 only .",
