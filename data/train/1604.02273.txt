    "as a matter of fact , many celestial bodies contain magnetic field which is believed to be driven by electromagnetic induction , i.e. dynamo action .",
    "magnetic fields are important for various physical processes including cosmic ray propagation , influence stellar ( solar ) activity , etc .",
    ", while their origin is still an open problem in astrophysics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "it remains still unclear whether these magnetic field was at first created by battery effects in protogalaxies and then amplified by dynamo action up to the present - day strengths or the seed fields for dynamo action originate in magnetic fields which seem to be existed in the early universe before recombination .",
    "the first observational indications of the presence of cosmological magnetic fields ( cmf ) in the inter - galactic medium @xcite still do not exclude the first possibility however strongly support the latter option .    the elaboration of the concept of magnetic field origin located in the very early universe faced an obvious problem that we know very few about magnetic field at the very beginning of cosmological evolution .",
    "each step of analysis shifts the problem for earlier and earlier stages of cosmological evolution and we are less and less informed about magnetic fields at these stages . at the first sight , it creates a rather unresolved problem for understanding of the topic , however , fortunately expansion of the universe makes later stages relatively independent of the previous ones .",
    "our aim here is to report such relative independence for one instructive quantity , namely magnetic helicity , which is achieved at the stage before the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) at the epoch when the magnetic helicity originates from the hepermagnetic one .",
    "remarkably , the problem occurs to be important for understanding of other fundamental physical property of contemporary universe , i.e. substantial baryon - anti - baryon asymmetry known from everyday life and supported by astronomical observations .    specifically , we study lepto / baryogenesis in the early universe plasma before ewpt in the presence of large - scale hypermagnetic fields ( hmf ) with an arbitrary hypermagnetic helicity density accounting for continuous hmf energy density spectra .",
    "this differs our approach from the simplified model with the maximum helicity density spectrum used in our previous works @xcite .",
    "the choice of our scenario is motivated by the presence of the massless hypercharge fields @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) in hot electroweak plasma before ewpt that inevitably becomes a progenitor of the maxwellian field @xmath8 after ewpt .",
    "one can also show that during ewpt of the first order supported by a strong hmf at @xmath9 the hypermagnetic helicity fully converts to the magnetic one @xcite .",
    "the question how helical hmf can produce the observed baryon asymmetry of universe ( bau ) as well as the following maxwellian cmf evolution were studied in many papers @xcite .",
    "the maxwellian chiral cmf evolution has been recently studied with the use of a non - uniform chiral anomaly in @xcite , applying anomalous maxwell equations for inhomogeneous chiral plasma in @xcite and with the use of antisymmetric part of the photon polarization operator generated by a non - zero neutrino asymmetry in paper @xcite.the anomalous conversion of leptons to baryons during leptogenesis was studied also in paper @xcite , and the chiral change erasure via thermal fluctuations of magnetic helicity in the work @xcite .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we reproduce the scheme of our scenario developed in our previous papers @xcite starting from explanation of the current ( [ current ] ) given by the chern - simons anomaly . in that section",
    "we renew our approach considering an arbitrary initial hmf helicity . in subsection",
    "ii.a we demonstrate in the case of a monochromatic spectrum how such a helicity tends to the maximal one due to the conservation law coming from the pair of self - consistent kinetic equations for spectra of the hmf helicity and hmf energy densities",
    ". meaning an application to a realistic ( say , kolmogorov ) spectrum we formulate in subsection ii.b our initial conditions .",

    "iv we calculate the hmf helicity density , and in sec .",
    "v we calculate the baryon asymmetry . finally in sec .",
    "vi we discuss our results comparing them with some similar approaches in literature .",
