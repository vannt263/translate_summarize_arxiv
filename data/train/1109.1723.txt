    "the excitations and stability of spinor bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have been the subject of intense study in recent years .",
    "the topic was first explored in two seminal theoretical papers in 1998 @xcite .",
    "these papers discussed the stability of @xmath2 becs against small external perturbations , such as fluctuations in the trapping potential or small magnetic field gradients . in an unstable spinor condensate",
    "small perturbations may lead to domain formation , where the populations of spin components become position dependent .",
    "the theoretical studies typically examine the stability of stationary states .",
    "this is done using a linear stability analysis , where a small perturbation is added to the stationary state and the time evolution equations are expanded to first order in the perturbation @xcite .",
    "these theoretical studies have shown that the stationary states of ferromagnetic @xmath2 condensates may be unstable .",
    "antiferromagnetic condensates in stationary states , on the other hand , appear to be stable against small perturbations in the absence of external fields .",
    "the properties of spinor condensates have been studied by various experimental groups ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "signs of instability have been observed by the chapman group @xcite in a ferromagnetic @xmath2 condensate and the sengstock group in an antiferromagnetic phase of an @xmath3 rubidium condensate @xcite .",
    "the group of stamper - kurn has observed that an @xmath2 @xmath1rb condensate prepared in a stationary paramagnetic state develops spin textures as it is rapidly quenched across a quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "they saw a similar phenomenon when an unmagnetized rubidium gas was cooled to quantum degeneracy @xcite .",
    "experiments often concentrate on spin - mixing dynamics , which can be initiated by preparing the condensate in a non - stationary state .",
    "there are a few theoretical studies where the stability analysis has been extended to nonstationary states : the effects of a non - zero magnetic field on the stability of states with time - independent spin populations but oscillating relative phases have been examined in refs .  @xcite .",
    "although the spin populations remain constant throughout the time evolution , these states are nonstationary because the relative phases of the spin components vary in time .",
    "another example is given by ref .",
    "@xcite , where the stability of states that show oscillations both in spin populations and relative phases was studied , under the assumption that the magnetic field vanishes .    in the present paper",
    ", we generalize these findings to arbitrary states with and without magnetic fields .",
    "we concentrate on the case where the magnetic field is nonzero and also consider a situation where the spin populations , as well as the phases of the spin components , oscillate in time . in the analytical calculations we assume that the particle density is homogeneous .",
    "we solve analytically for the eigenmodes and eigenstates of a certain class of nonstationary states in rubidium and sodium condensates in an arbitrary magnetic field .",
    "we show that this can be done in a simple way by transforming to a reference frame where the states in question are stationary . in this way",
    ", the time dependence of the matrix determining the stability properties can be eliminated , and the problem becomes easily tractable .",
    "we emphasize that we are studying the stability in nonzero magnetic field .",
    "the zero - field case has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "knowing the eigenmodes allows us to derive an analytical formula that connects the stability of a condensate to its size and the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "in @xcite it was found that a sodium condensate is unstable at a low magnetic field provided that the condensate is larger than the spin healing length .",
    "we show here that in a situation where the magnetic - field energy dominates over the spin interaction energy , both rubidium and sodium condensates may be unstable even when the size of the condensate is smaller than the spin healing length .",
