    "<S> the rydberg excitation is carried out with a @xmath53-pulse , with respect to the collective rabi frequency @xmath54 . in the regime of a relatively large initial number of atoms , i.e. @xmath55 , this collective rabi frequency changes negligibly with the emission of each ion . </S>",
    "<S> thus , each excitation cycle of length @xmath56 will - with probability close to unity - excite a single rydberg atom , and this excitation process will remain efficient even after many ions have been emitted . </S>",

[ fig : trapped](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that initially the mean number of emitted ions @xmath41 grows with the number of cycles @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this example with @xmath67 initial atoms , the probability of emitting ions beyond the @xmath67-th cycle is strongly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the data shows that no more than @xmath68 ions will be emitted in total even if the number of cycles is increased . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for that is the emergence of trapped states which occur when @xmath69 becomes an integer multiple of @xmath53 . here </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution operator ( [ eq : unitary ] ) becomes the identity ( up to a phase factor of @xmath70 ) and consequently the excitation step does not generate rydberg atoms . </S>",

    "<S> all other parameters are those of panel ( b ) . ]    _ ( iii ) excitation from an extended atomic cloud _ - so far we have considered a fully blockaded dense atomic sample in a microtrap with radius much smaller than @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> let us now discuss the situation usually encountered in extended systems like standard mots . here </S>",
    "<S> the atom density is relatively small and , moreover , atoms can diffuse in and out of the excitation volume as depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup](b ) . in order to account for the effects of diffusion we use a simple rate model : atoms can enter the excitation volume at a constant rate @xmath81 and </S>",
    "<S> leave it at a rate @xmath82 , where @xmath10 is the number of atoms in the volume and @xmath83 is the diffusion rate . in an equilibrium gas cloud </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath84 and hence @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the mean number of atoms in the excitation volume . </S>",
    "<S> this simple model yields a poissonian atom distribution with mean @xmath87 for finding @xmath10 atoms in the excitation region .    to describe the influence of diffusion on the ion source dynamics we exploit the fact that the excitation cycle ( @xmath88ns ) is typically much shorter than the ionization step ( @xmath89s ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus we assume that diffusion is only relevant during the latter . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the frozen gas approximation usually employed in the description of the laser excitation of cold rydberg gases . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we consider the limit of slow diffusion , i.e. we assume @xmath90 , which means that during the ionization cycle only one atom will enter / leave the excitation volume at a time . </S>",
    "<S> effectively this amounts to solving the diffusion equation up to first order . within these approximations </S>",
    "<S> we can again use the above - employed theoretical framework of dynamical quantum maps and arrive at dynamical equations analogous to ( [ eq : iteration ] ) ( see appendix ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now investigate the excitation dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the initial mean number of atoms in the excitation volume is @xmath91 . with a realistic blockade radius of 5  @xmath92 m </S>",
    "<S> this would correspond to typical mot densities of 10@xmath93 atoms/@xmath94 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cycles ] ( a ) and ( b ) we show the corresponding probability distributions @xmath52 for the case without diffusion and for a diffusion rate of @xmath75 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the data are averaged over the distribution of the initial number of particles in the volume and the excitation pulse length is fixed at @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> this choice therefore corresponds to a @xmath53-pulse with respect to the collective rabi frequency @xmath95 . comparing figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cycles](a ) and ( b ) we see that diffusion leads to a slow drift of the ion number distribution to larger mean values with increasing number of excitation - ionization cycles . </S>",
    "<S> this drift stems from the fact that the excitation volume is quickly depleted due the ionization process which is much faster than the diffusion . at long times </S>",
    "<S> ( large @xmath7 ) further ions can only be produced when particles diffuse into the empty excitation volume leading to a slow increase of the total number of emitted ions .    </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , however , for the first few cycles the ion source produces one ion per cycle with a high probability and is therefore quasi - deterministic . </S>",
    "<S> note that this is despite averaging over the initial atom number distribution . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , even when operated in an extended atomic cloud , the behavior of the ion source is very similar to that in a fully blockaded sample discussed in _ ( i)_. this is further corroborated by fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cycles](c ) where we show the probability of having emitted @xmath7 ions after @xmath7 excitation - ionization cycles . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> we also show the probability for that case in which the rydberg excitation is performed with a @xmath53-pulse w.r.t . </S>",
    "<S> the single atom rabi frequency @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the data shows that the performance of the ion source is indeed significantly improving when the excitation pulse is chosen as @xmath53-pulse w.r.t . </S>",
    "<S> the collective rabi frequency @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> note , that the performance of the ion - source can be enhanced further by resetting the ion source after the few cycles during which quasi - deterministic ion emission is taking place . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by refocusing the excitation laser to a different part of the gas cloud thereby avoiding the depletion of the excitation volume and the broadening of the ion distribution visible in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cycles](a , b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , we have presented and analyzed theoretically a fast and heralded single ion source based on a dipole - blockaded atomic ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> the source can be operated in a variety of dynamical regimes and permits the quasi - continuous and quasi - deterministic production of single ions even from a extended gas cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the statistics of the ion emission shows some interesting dynamical features such as the emergence of trapped states , reminiscent of micromaser physics . </S>",
