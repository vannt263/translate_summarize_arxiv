    "the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is subject to enormous international research campaigns @xcite . in order to understand its main characteristic features such as the different phases of strongly interacting matter , the nature of the transitions between them , the existence and locations of critical points or perhaps approximate triple points and even multicritical points , it has proven to be very useful to deform qcd by not only varying the individual quarks masses but also the numbers of their different flavors and colors .",
    "an important example is the limit of infinitely many colors @xmath0 which inspired many qualitative descriptions of the qcd phase diagram @xcite .",
    "one interesting aspect of this limit is that the baryon density becomes an order parameter for @xmath1 , in particular , also when the number of flavors @xmath2 grows along with @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath3 held fixed . in this paper",
    "we study two - color qcd , which shares this aspect of the large-@xmath4 limit , here with @xmath5 .",
    "if one accepts that the phases of many - color qcd with @xmath6 have a bearing on the real world , it might therefore not be absurd , with due appreciation of all differences , to consider @xmath5 either .",
    "quantum chromodynamics with two colors ( qc@xmath7d ) has been well studied for many years within chiral effective field theory and random matrix theory @xcite , in lattice simulations @xcite , and the nambu  jona - lasinio model . in this paper",
    "we formulate a polyakov - quark - meson - diquark ( pqmd ) model for studying the phase diagram of qc@xmath7d with the functional renormalization group , including fluctuations due to collective excitations .",
    "the most important differences between two and three colors follow from the special property of the @xmath8 gauge group of qc@xmath7d : its representations are either pseudo - real or real which leads to an antiunitary symmetry in the dirac operator @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the fermion determinant remains real for non - vanishing baryon or quark chemical potential , @xmath9 , as it does for adjoint quarks in any - color qcd , or in the @xmath10 gauge theory with fundamental fermions also , for example .",
    "thus , for an even number of degenerate fundamental quark flavors in qc@xmath7dthere is _ no fermion - sign problem _ and the phase diagram is amenable to lattice monte - carlo simulations .",
    "symmetry considerations , lattice simulations and non - perturbative functional continuum methods together should therefore allow us to understand the phase diagram of this theory completely .",
    "a combined effort towards this goal will be very worthwhile in particular because it will help to bring the functional continuum methods to a level at which they can reliably be applied , with the necessary adjustments , also to real qcd where lattice simulations suffer from the infamous fermion - sign problem @xcite .",
    "another consequence of the pseudo - reality is the pauli - grsey symmetry which allows to combine quarks and charge - conjugated antiquarks into enlarged flavor multiplets . as a result , for vanishing chemical potential and quark mass , @xmath11 , the usual @xmath12 chiral and baryon number symmetries",
    "are replaced by an extended @xmath13 flavor symmetry which is ( spontaneously ) broken by a ( dynamical ) dirac mass down to the @xmath14 dimensional compact symplectic group @xmath15 .",
    "for @xmath16 the extended flavor symmetry group @xmath17 and its @xmath18 subgroup are locally isomorphic to the rotation groups @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . the coset is given by @xmath21 , the unit sphere in six dimensions , and a spontaneously generated dirac mass will lead to five goldstone bosons , the three pions plus a scalar diquark - antidiquark pair .    moreover , for @xmath22 these color - singlet scalar diquarks play a dual role as bosonic baryons at the same time . while this thus represents the perhaps most important difference as compared to the real world , it also makes it much easier to investigate the effects of baryonic degrees of freedom on the phase diagram in functional approaches . in that sense",
    "our model can be considered as a first step towards their inclusion in a ` quark - meson - baryon ' model for real qcd with three colors .",
    "for the same reason our model of qc@xmath7dprovides a relativistic analogue of the bec - bcs crossover in ultracold fermionic quantum - gases , which has also been described successfully with functional renormalization group methods @xcite .",
    "in contrast to non - relativistic models of the bec - bcs crossover , an interesting additional constraint thereby arises from the silver blaze property @xcite : when a relativistic chemical potential @xmath23 is coupled to degrees of freedom with a mass gap @xmath24 , at zero temperature , the partition function and hence thermodynamic observables must actually remain independent of the chemical potential as long as @xmath25 .",
    "we will see that it is not trivial , in general , to implement this constraint in non - perturbative functional renormalization group studies , and that it can provide valuable extra information to devise intelligent truncations .",
    "our main interest here , however , is to explicitly demonstrate the impact of baryonic degrees of freedom on the phase diagram by comparing the purely mesonic model , representative of typical three - color qcd model calculations , to the full quark - meson - diquark model .    for this comparison",
    "we argue that it is more appropriate to think of the vacuum diquark mass as the baryon mass @xmath26 rather than the pion mass @xmath27 . in qc@xmath7dwith",
    "its extended flavor symmetry they are the same , but the essential aspect of this assignment is that a continuous phase transition at zero temperature occurs at a critical quark chemical potential @xmath28 . except for the scale separation between @xmath27 and @xmath26 in the real world",
    ", this transition can then be thought to correspond to the liquid - gas transition of nuclear matter in qcd with three colors which is of first order , involves the binding energy , and thus occurs somewhat below @xmath29 .",
    "as temperature increases the liquid gas transition ends , turning into a crossover with continuously varying but nevertheless probably still relatively abruptly increasing baryon density along some narrow region .",
    "this rapid increase is generally expected to lead to the strong chemical - potential dependence of the chemical freeze - out line observed in heavy ion collisions at center - of - mass energies below about 10 gev per nucleon pair , the baryonic freeze - out @xcite .",
    "one might conclude that the phase transition line for diquark condensation , where a rapidly increasing baryon density spontaneously develops , would be the origin of a corresponding baryonic freeze - out line in two - color qcd , with @xmath30 arguably not necessarily further from reality than the large @xmath31 limits . as in the latter",
    ", one might then even identify a two - color version of quarkyonic matter @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that our model , the functional renormalization group equations and the techniques to solve them have a broad scope of applications beyond two - color qcd .",
    "one example is qcd with two light flavors at finite isospin chemical potential , which has been studied with the njl model in mean - field plus random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "there is a precise equivalence between the corresponding quark - meson model with isospin chemical potential and our quark - meson - diquark model of two - color qcd .",
    "besides changing @xmath0 this merely involves reducing the number of would - be goldstone bosons from five to three again , retaining only one of our degenerate pions , and reinterpreting the diquarks as the charged pions with isospin chemical potential @xcite .",
    "similar models are also studied in the context of color superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the capacity to numerically solve functional renormalization group equations on higher dimensional grids in field space is generally useful for competing symmetries , as in a quark - meson model study of the axial anomaly with scale dependent t  hooft couplings , for example @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : constrqm ] we review the general features of qc@xmath7dsuch as its enlarged flavor symmetry and the possible symmetry breaking patterns in some more detail . based on these symmetry considerations",
    "we then construct the polyakov - loop extended quark - meson - diquark lagrangian for qc@xmath7d . in the next section , sec .",
    "[ sec : mf ] , we derive the thermodynamic potential of the ( p)qmd model in mean - field approximation , discuss so - called vacuum contributions , the silver blaze property and the relevance of pole versus screening masses for mesons and diquarks .",
    "the functional renormalization group flow equations for the effective potential in leading - order derivative expansion are derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : funrg ] . in this section",
    "we also calculate critical exponents which are consistent with the expected symmetry breaking pattern , investigate in how far mean - field results are modified by fluctuations , and give a transparent illustration of the importance of baryonic degrees of freedom for the phase diagram . as a byproduct",
    "we note that starting from a tricritical point , a region of first - order transition limiting the diquark condensation phase at larger chemical potentials as predicted from chiral perturbation theory at next - to - leading order @xcite , is also observed in the qmd model at the mean - field level .",
    "this first - order transition turns out to be a mean - field artifact , however .",
    "it is washed out by the fluctuations , and there is no sign of a tricritical point left , once the thermodynamic potential is obtained from its functional renormalization group flow .",
    "we draw our conclusions and present an outlook in sec .",
    "[ sec : outlook ] .",
    "technical details can be found in several appendices .",
    "we begin this section with a short review of the extended flavor symmetries of qc@xmath7ddue to its pauli - grsey symmetry , and the associated symmetry breaking patterns .",
    "we then discuss a qualitative phase diagram for two - flavor qc@xmath7d and construct the quark - meson - diquark ( qmd ) model by a suitable vector coupling of quark bilinears to meson and diquark fields .      as all half - odd integer representations of @xmath8 , its fundamental representation is pseudoreal , which means that it is isomorphic to its complex conjugate representation with the isometry given by @xmath32 , @xmath33 . with @xmath34 , just as those of the adjoint groups @xmath35 or most of the exceptional lie groups such as @xmath10 .",
    "] therefore , charge conjugation of the gauge fields in qc@xmath7dcan be undone by the constant @xmath8 gauge transformation @xmath32 . from now on we will use @xmath36 for the color generators , with @xmath37 and reserve @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) for the pauli matrices in spinor ( flavor ) space . together with the charge conjugation matrix @xmath40 in spinor space , likewise with @xmath41 , and complex conjugation denoted by @xmath42 one then defines an antiunitary symmetry @xmath43 with @xmath44 ( in a real color representation with @xmath45 , one has @xmath46 , correspondingly ) .",
    "this leads to the classification of the dirac operator by the dyson index @xmath47 of random matrix theory @xcite , with @xmath48 for fermions in the pseudoreal fundamental color representation of qc@xmath7d(or @xmath49 in the real color representations of @xmath35 or @xmath10 ) .    following @xcite , we start from the standard kinetic part of the euclidean qc@xmath7dlagrangian , in the chiral basis , @xmath50 with hermitian @xmath51-matrices , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , @xmath54 as independent grassmann variables with @xmath55 .",
    "the covariant derivative is @xmath56 , and the coupling is absorbed in the gauge fields @xmath57 .",
    "the two terms in ( [ eq:2 ] ) get interchanged under the antiunitary symmetry @xmath58 .",
    "if we apply it only to the second term , say , by using @xmath59 for the chiral @xmath60-component of the charge conjugation matrix @xmath40 , _ i.e. _ , changing variables to @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we can therefore reexpress @xmath63 in terms of the @xmath64 @xmath65-dimensional spinors @xmath66 and @xmath67 . because it is now block diagonal , the @xmath13 symmetry in the space combining flavor and transformed chiral components is manifest in this form . with the same transformation of variables",
    "the quarks dirac - mass term becomes @xmath68 where the symplectic matrix @xmath69 acts in the @xmath64-dimensional extended flavor space .",
    "an explicit(dynamical ) dirac mass therefore explicitly(spontaneously ) breaks the original @xmath13 down to the compact symplectic group @xmath15 , sometimes also referred to as @xmath70 reflecting the fact that it is the intersection of the unitary @xmath71 and the symplectic @xmath72 , the invariance group of @xmath73 as bilinear form on complex @xmath64-vectors .    for @xmath16 flavors the enlarged flavor symmetry group of qc@xmath7dis @xmath17 , not @xmath74",
    "because of the axial anomaly , it replaces the usual chiral and baryon number symmetries @xmath75 . just as this extended flavor @xmath17 shares its 15 dimensional lie algebra with the group of rotations in 6 dimensions , @xmath19 , its @xmath18 subgroup leaving the dirac - mass term invariant has the 10 dimensional lie algebra of @xmath20 ( in fact they are both the universal covers of the respective rotation groups ) .",
    "our brief review of the qc@xmath7dsymmetries so far holds for vanishing chemical potential . for @xmath76 but @xmath77 ,",
    "the @xmath13 symmetry is broken explicitly by @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "this is also easy to see , from , ( [ eq:3 ] ) , as it amounts to introducing the term @xmath80 with @xcite @xmath81 for @xmath16 , in terms of the rotation groups , this symmetry breaking pattern is locally the same as @xmath82 .",
    "when both @xmath23 and @xmath83 are non - zero , the unbroken flavor symmetry is of course given by the common subgroup @xmath84 of the two limiting cases @xmath85 , @xmath86 or @xmath87 , @xmath9 discussed above . whether , as an approximate symmetry , it is more like the @xmath88 or like the @xmath89 , naturally depends on the relative sizes of dirac mass @xmath83 and quark chemical potential @xmath23 .",
    "more precisely , it is an exact result of chiral effective field theory @xcite , that for baryon chemical potential @xmath90 the approximate chiral symmetry breaking pattern remains that of @xmath91 and the vacuum alignment is @xmath92-like with an approximate @xmath88 if @xmath83 is sufficiently small , while ( at zero temperature ) for @xmath93 a diquark condensate develops and the vacuum alignment starts rotating from being @xmath94-like to becoming more and more @xmath95-like as @xmath23 is further increased .",
    "the chiral condensate then rapidly decreases , chiral symmetry appears to get restored but the increasing chemical potential reduces it to the approximate @xmath96 again .",
    "it is not the full flavor symmetry of the @xmath9 , @xmath77 case discussed above because we have entered the diquark - condensation phase with spontaneous baryon - number breaking , corresponding to superfluidity of the bosonic baryons .",
    "another exact result is that , at zero temperature and for @xmath97 , the onset of baryon condensation , the baryon density remains zero and the thermodynamic observables must be independent of @xmath23 .",
    "because this is far from obvious to verify explicitly in actual calculations , it has been named the silver blaze problem @xcite . in order to be able to excite any states at zero temperature , and with a gap in the spectrum",
    ", the relativistic chemical potential needs to be increased beyond the mass gap in the correlations to which it couples . here , with a continuous zero - temperature transition at @xmath98 this gap",
    "is simply given by the baryon mass in vacuum which because of the extended flavor symmetry in qc@xmath7dcoincides with the pion mass , @xmath99 .",
    "this latter property is of course special to @xmath22 .",
    "the silver blaze property will hold , as it does here , up to a quark chemical potential of the order of @xmath100 ( reduced by @xmath101 of the binding energy per nucleon when the transition is of first order ) , in general , however .",

    "[ fig : pdsketch ] .",
    "the solid line in the @xmath104 plane there represents the continuous zero - temperature transition with diquark condensation which is of mean - field type .",
    "because the quark mass @xmath102 scales quadratically with the pion mass , it will occur along a parabola @xmath105 .",
    "the thick dashed lines represent the corresponding second - order transitions at finite temperature in fixed @xmath102 planes of the @xmath106 universality .",
    "the thick line along the temperature axis is the magnetic first - order transition in the @xmath107 plane which probably ends in a multi - critical point . when viewed in the @xmath107 plane , this is the critical endpoint in the @xmath108 universality class for the chiral phase transition in qc@xmath7d with its extended @xmath17 flavor symmetry . in the @xmath109 plane ,",
    "the vacuum alignment will always be @xmath110-like , for no - matter - how - small @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , in this plane one only has the second - order @xmath106 line which might end in the same point making it multi - critical .",
    "the starting point of our model construction is the flavor structure of the standard chiral condensate and the quark mass term which is of the form @xmath112 .",
    "it therefore transforms under the full flavor @xmath17 according to the six - dimensional antisymmetric representation in the decomposition @xmath113 .",
    "the other components belonging to the same multiplet are obtained from transformations @xmath114 then , @xmath115 , where , from cartan s immersion theorem , the whole coset @xmath116 is obtained in this way via @xmath117 .",
    "the coset elements @xmath118 are in turn parametrized by six - dimensional unit vectors @xmath119 as @xmath120 , with @xmath121 and @xmath122 such that @xmath123 , @xmath124 , form a basis for the coset generators @xcite .",
    "thus , one verifies explicitly that the vector @xmath125 transforms as a ( complex ) six - dimensional vector under @xmath19 .",
    "a locally @xmath126 invariant linear sigma model lagrangian can therefore be defined by coupling the real @xmath19 vector of quark bilinears @xmath127 to a vector of mesonic fields @xmath128 formed by the scalar @xmath129 meson , the pseudoscalar pions @xmath130 and the scalar diquark - antidiquark pair @xmath24 .",
    "this yields the lagrangian ( now including color and spinor components again ) , @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the meson and diquark potential whose precise form will be specified later .",
    "a non - vanishing chemical potential couples not only to the quarks but also to the bosonic diquarks . rewriting in terms of the original variables we obtain the quark - meson - diquark ( qmd ) model lagrangian @xmath133 with @xmath134 and a flavor- and color - blind yukawa coupling @xmath135 . with @xmath136 one obtains the corresponding @xmath108 linear sigma model ; and in the limit @xmath137 , the bosonic part of @xmath138 is equivalent to the leading - order @xmath139pt lagrangian of refs .",
    "@xcite . to see this",
    "explicitly it is best to start from the latter , use the explicit coset parametrization of @xcite as given above , and make the identifications @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "it maybe worthwhile mentioning that the coefficient of the leading term in @xmath23 of the @xmath139pt lagrangian , @xmath142 with @xmath143 , which was fixed from gauging the flavor @xmath17 in @xcite , here simply follows from @xmath144 as part of the kinetic term of the complex scalar diquark field @xmath24 with chemical potential @xmath145 .",
    "this implies in particular , that the meson / diquark potential @xmath146 itself , up to the explicit breaking by @xmath147 , which needs to be only @xmath148 invariant in general at finite @xmath23 , must remain @xmath19 invariant , however , at this leading order , @xmath149 , and therefore at @xmath150 in the fields , likewise .",
    "we can thus only have an @xmath19 invariant mass term in @xmath146 .    in the following",
    "it will be more convenient to rewrite the lagrangian in terms of nambu - gorkov - like spinors @xmath151 , where @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) denote the red ( green ) color components of @xmath154 and @xmath155 as in @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath156 where @xmath157    gauge field dynamics and confinement effects can be modeled also in qc@xmath7dby including a constant polyakov - loop variable as a background field as in the njl model @xcite , and analogous to what is commonly done in the so - called polyakov - loop - extended quark - meson models of three - color qcd . to this end one introduces a constant temporal background gauge field @xmath158 which is furthermore assumed to be in the cartan subalgebra as in the polyakov gauge , _",
    "i.e. _ , for @xmath126 simply given by @xmath159 .",
    "this leads to the polyakov loop variable @xmath160 to model a thermal expectation value of the color - traced polyakov loop at an inverse temperature @xmath161 , as an order parameter for the deconfinement transition at vanishing chemical potential .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath162 leads to an additional contribution of the form @xmath163 which can be rewritten as @xmath164 in terms of the spinor field @xmath165 .",
    "finally , we then arrive at the polyakov - loop - extended quark - meson - diquark model ( pqmd ) lagrangian , @xmath166 with @xmath167 defined in and @xmath168 is the polyakov - loop potential @xcite which is commonly fitted to lattice results , but which can also be computed with functional methods @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the three - color case the polyakov - loop potential is a function of one single real variable @xmath169 here , even in the presence of a diquark condensate .",
    "the grand potential in mean - field approximation is obtained by integrating over the quark fields and neglecting bosonic fluctuations .",
    "this means that all mesonic and diquark fields are replaced by their constant expectation values @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 . in momentum space",
