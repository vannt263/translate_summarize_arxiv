    "the molecular interstellar medium ( ism ) is one of the crucial components in galaxies . in particular ,",
    "warm and/or dense molecular gas play an important key role on star formation because stars are formed from the _ dense _ cores of molecular clouds and uv radiation from ob stars in massive star forming regions can easily heat neighboring molecular clouds locally ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is essential to investigate basic physical state , density and temperature , of molecular ism for understanding of the evolutions of molecular clouds and star formation .    in our galaxy ,",
    "a large fraction of molecular ism is in a form of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ; @xcite , @xcite ) , which are known to be major sites of massive star formation .",
    "typical sizes of gmcs are a few 10 pc  100 pc . for this spatial scale , a lot of observational studies of molecular gas , star formation , and their relationships have been carried out toward local group galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite made a positional comparison of gmcs with classical h regions and clusters in large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) at a @xmath14 40 pc resolution .",
    "they classified gmcs into three types in terms of star formation activities , i.e. , type i gmcs with no signs of massive star formation , type ii gmcs associated with only small h regions , and type iii gmcs associated with both h regions and young stellar clusters .",
    "the authors suggest these types reflect evolutional stages of gmcs .",
    "in addition , @xcite derived intensity ratios of @xmath2co(@xmath4)/@xmath0co(@xmath4 ) and @xmath0co(@xmath4)/@xmath0co(@xmath1 ) , and determined density and kinetic temperature of molecular gas including all three types of gmcs in lmc by the application of the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) analysis .",
    "the authors found that the type i gmc with no signs of massive star formation shows its gas density of @xmath14 1 @xmath15 @xmath13 @xmath10 and kinetic temperature of 25  k , suggesting less dense and cool molecular gas . on the other hand",
    ", they found that type ii and iii gmcs , which are associated with h regions show their gas density of 3  5 @xmath15 @xmath13 @xmath10 and kinetic temperature exceeding 30 k , suggesting dense and warm molecular gas .    in local group galaxies , one of the nearest spiral galaxy , m  33",
    "( @xmath16 kpc ; @xcite ) , is also a very important target to perform observational studies of molecular gas and star formation .",
    "its proximity and the relatively small inclination ( @xmath17 degree ; @xcite ) of m 33 enable us to resolve individual gmcs even with existing large aperture single dishes .",
    "in addition , contrary to lmc , m  33 is able to be observed with various telescopes existing in the northern hemisphere . thus , many observational studies of molecular ism in m  33 have been performed .",
    "for example , whole disk surveys of molecular gas in @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) line emission have been carried out with the bima interferometer @xcite and the fcrao 14-m telescope @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite combined them with observations using the 45-m telescope at the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) toward a part of the disk . a partial mapping of @xmath2co(@xmath18 )",
    "line emission has also been made with the iram 30-m telescope @xcite .",
    "recently , the nro m  33 all disk survey of giant molecular clouds ( nro magic ) project using the nro 45-m telescope is ongoing .",
    "@xcite report initial results of the nro magic , presenting a high - quality and wide - field ( 30@xmath19 @xmath15 30@xmath19 or 7.3 kpc @xmath15 7.3 kpc ) image in @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) line emission at a resolution of @xmath20 ( 80 pc ) . using the data , @xcite found that a tight correlation between the surface densities of molecular gas and those of star formation rates seen in a few 100 pc @xmath14 a few kpc scales in galaxies , known as kennicutt - schmidt law @xcite , seems to be broken down in a @xmath14 100 pc scale or smaller in m  33 .",
    "detailed observations of the giant h region ngc  604 in m  33 are also reported .",
    "@xcite examined @xmath2co(@xmath4)/@xmath2co(@xmath1 ) intensity ratio , hereafter @xmath5 , and discovered high intensity ratio gas with an arclike distribution similar to h@xmath21 emission , suggesting that the sequential star formation is ongoing .",
    "@xcite observed @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) line , hcn(@xmath1 ) line , and 89 ghz continuum emission using the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) .",
    "they proposed a scenario of sequential star formation in which the massive star formation propagates through the expansion of the h@xmath21 emission nebula excited by the central ob star cluster .",
    "these observational studies clearly suggest the importance of multi - line / transition observations in mm / sub - mm waveband .    in this paper , we present @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) images of ngc  604 obtained with the nro 45-m telescope .",
    "@xmath0co(@xmath1 ) line emission is known to as a tracer of dense molecular gas ( @xmath22 @xmath14 @xmath23 @xmath10 ) . since the existing @xmath2co(@xmath1 )",
    "data can trace the total amount of molecular gas , the intensity ratio of @xmath0co(@xmath1)/@xmath2co(@xmath1 ) , hereafter @xmath3 , can be used as an indicator of gas density with a low or moderate temperature . in addition ,",
    "usage of @xmath2co(@xmath4 ) data obtained by @xcite enables us to obtain another line intensity ratio , @xmath5 , which is also an indicator of gas density .",
    "the combination of these two line ratios allows us to determine gas density and kinetic temperature of molecular gas simultaneously under the lvg approximation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "then , we will be able to compare physical properties of molecular gas , such as density and temperature , to the star formation activity in ngc 604 .",
    "the goals of this paper are : ( 1 ) to reveal the distribution of @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) line emission in ngc  604 , ( 2 ) to derive @xmath3 and @xmath5 , and determine the density and kinetic temperature of molecular gas under the lvg approximation , and ( 3 ) to investigate how these physical state of molecular gas , such as gas density and temperature , connect with the sequential star formation proposed by @xcite .",
    "@xmath0co(@xmath1 ) line emission observations of ngc  604 were performed using the nro 45-m telescope from 2009 may 9  20 , employing on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping mode .",
    "the total time for the observations was 21 hours .",
    "the size of the @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) map is about @xmath24 ( 480 @xmath15 480 pc ) , and the mapped area is indicated in figure  1 .",
    "we used a new waveguide - type dual - polarization sideband - separating 100-ghz band sis receiver , t100 @xcite .",
    "the half - power beam width of the telescope for two polarizations was 15@xmath25.3 @xmath12 0@xmath25.2 and 15@xmath25.4 @xmath12 0@xmath25.2 , the image rejection ratio was 13 db and 30 db , and the main beam efficiency of the 45-m telescope at 110 ghz was 0.40 and 0.44 , respectively .",
    "the system noise temperature was typically 200  250 k ( in single sideband ) during the observing run .",
    "we used digital spectrometers with a band width of 512 mhz and 1024 channels , corresponding to a velocity coverage of 1393 km s@xmath26 .",
    "otf mapping was performed along two different directions ( i.e. , scans along the r.a .  and decl .",
    "directions ) , and these two data sets were co - added by the basket - weave method @xcite in order to remove any effects of scanning noise . at the beginning of each otf scan , an off - source position , which was @xmath12 30@xmath19 offset in the r.a .",
    "direction from the map center taken at @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( j2000 ) , was observed to subtract sky emission .",
    "the absolute pointing accuracy was checked every hour with an sio maser source , irc + 30021 , using a 43 ghz sis receiver ( s40 ) .",
    "it was better than 6@xmath25 ( peak - to - peak ) throughout the observations .",
    "the data reduction was made using the software package nostar , which comprises tools for otf data analysis , developed by naoj @xcite .",
    "the raw data were regridded to 7@xmath25.5 per pixel , giving an effective spatial resolution of approximately 20@xmath25 ( or 80 pc ) .",
    "linear baselines were subtracted from the spectra .",
    "we binned the adjacent channels to a velocity resolution of 2.5 km s@xmath26 for the @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) spectra . going through these procedures ,",
    "a 3d data cube was created . the resultant r.m.s",
    ".  noise level ( 1 @xmath29 ) was typically in the range of 25 to 30 mk in the @xmath30 scale .    in order to derive two line ratios , @xmath3 and @xmath5",
    ", we used @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) data obtained with the nro 45-m telescope ( @xcite ) and @xmath2co(@xmath4 ) data obtained with the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) 10-m ( @xcite ) . in order to make the comparison among each co line easier ,",
    "both @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) and @xmath2co(@xmath4 ) data were regridded to match @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) data using the nrao aips task hgeom .",
    "in addition , we have convolved both @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) and @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) data , whose original angular resolution is 20@xmath25 , to 25@xmath25 in order to match the @xmath2co(@xmath4 ) data for further discussion .",
    "after the convolution of @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) data cube to 25@xmath25 , its r.m.s .  noise level ( 1 @xmath29 ) decreased to 16 mk in the @xmath30 scale .",
    "observation parameters in each co line are listed in table  1 .",
    "we calculated velocity - integrated intensities of @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) and @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) line emission of ngc  604 as shown in figure  2 .",
    "this map suggests that two gmcs are overlapping in line - of - sight in the south - eastern region .",
    "thus , we examined spectra of both @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) and @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) line in figure  3 , and found the existence of two velocity components .",
    "one is within a velocity range of @xmath31 to @xmath32 km s@xmath26 , which is referred to as `` blue '' component in this paper , and the other is @xmath32 to @xmath33 km s@xmath26 referred to as `` red '' .",
    "therefore , we recalculated velocity - integrated intensities of each co line emission to separate red and blue components .",
    "figure  4 shows a new @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) integrated intensity map , separating these two velocity components .",
    "figure 5 shows comparisons among maps of integrated - intensity in @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) , @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) , and @xmath2co(@xmath4 ) line emission , respectively .",
    "in addition , we compared the distribution of @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) line emission to that of h@xmath21 luminosity @xcite .",
    "we finally found 3 gmcs in @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) intensity maps , and labeled these gmcs as gmc - a , b , and c beginning at the north as shown in figure  5 .",
    "the gmc - a and b correspond to blue components , and the gmc - c corresponds to a red component .",
    "every gmcs are already identified by @xcite ; the gmc - a , b , and c correspond to the gmc number 122 , 124 , and 126 in @xcite sample , respectively .",
    "each gmc has counterparts in @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) and @xmath2co(@xmath4 ) line emission .",
    "however , massive star forming regions traced by h@xmath21 emission only exist in the northern part of the central @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) emitting region . in addition , the distribution of h@xmath21 emission is very similar to that of 8.4 ghz radio continuum ( @xcite ) , which also trace massive star forming regions .",
    "this means that massive star formation is ongoing only in the northern part of the gmc - b .      in order to compare physical properties among these 3 gmcs",
    ", we derive two line intensity ratios , @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "the absolute errors of the @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) , @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) , and @xmath2co(@xmath4 ) intensities caused by calibration uncertainties were estimated to be 15% , respectively .",
    "thus , the absolute error of each line ratio is estimated to be 30% .",
    "for the gmc - b , we derive @xmath3 and @xmath5 in two different ways .",
    "one is at the @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) peak position ( , ) , which is @xmath14 22@xmath25 offset in the south - east direction from the central star cluster , and the other is an averaged value within the whole gmc .",
    "note that we can not make the `` map '' of @xmath3 such as that of @xmath5 reported by @xcite .",
    "this is because the signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) data is insufficient to make the line - ratio map .",
    "we obtain an averaged line ratio within the whole gmc according to the following procedure .",
    "first , we define the `` border '' of the gmc using the data of @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) integrated intensity . for a gmc ,",
    "we treat a pixel whose value is more than the half of the peak value in the gmc as the `` gmc pixel '' .",
    "this `` gmc pixel '' is applied to each co lines in common .",
    "then , we sum up the values of all the `` gmc pixel '' in each co line , and obtain the total pixel values of @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) , @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) , and @xmath2co(@xmath4 ) line intensity for the gmc , respectively . finally , we calculate @xmath3 and @xmath5 according to these total pixel values .",
    "thus , we obtained @xmath34 and @xmath35 as averaged values within the whole gmc - b , and obtained @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the peak position of the gmc - b , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , for the gmc - a and c , their sizes ( 70  80 pc ) are smaller than that of the gmc - b ( @xmath36 100pc ) .",
    "in addition , peak positions of each co line emission are offset ( @xmath37  @xmath38 ) each other .",
    "thus , we derive only averaged values of @xmath3 and @xmath5 within each whole gmc as we do for the gmc - b .",
    "we obtained @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the gmc - a , and obtained @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the gmc - c , respectively .",
    "note that since the @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) emitting region associated with the gmc - c seems to be distributed beyond the mapped area , the derived @xmath3 value of the gmc - c contain additional errors compared to other gmcs .",
    "we found significant differences in derived line intensity ratios between the gmc - b and other two gmcs ; both @xmath3 and @xmath5 of the gmc - b are larger than those of the gmc - a and c. this suggests differences in physical properties of ism among these gmcs , which will be discussed further in the following section .",
    "we compare observed @xmath3 values in ngc  604 to those obtained by @xcite , who reported a robust lvg analysis for several regions in m  33 including ngc  604 . for the peak position of gmc - b , which is labeled as ngc  604 - 2 in @xcite ,",
    "the authors obtained @xmath3 = 0.07  0.10 .",
    "this seems consistent with our @xmath3 , 0.09  0.11 .",
    "in addition , we compare our @xmath3 values in ngc  604 to those in our galaxy and other local group galaxies . in the galactic disk ,",
    "the averaged @xmath3 value is 0.15  0.18 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in some regions of lmc ,",
    "the reported @xmath3 value is in the range of 0.05 to 0.21 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found @xmath43 at the center of a giant molecular association ( gma ) of m  31 , and found a possible sign of a radial gradient on @xmath3 from the center to the outer edge of the gma , where the observed @xmath3 value is 0.11 .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 for the gmc - b , 0.09  0.11 , seems to be typical values or a little lower , whereas @xmath3 of the gmc - a and c , 0.05  0.06 , seems to be significantly lower values compared to that in our galaxy and in other local group galaxies .",
    "as described in the previous section , it seems that physical properties of molecular ism are different among these 3 gmcs considering the differences in @xmath3 and @xmath5 values . in this section",
    ", we show the further analysis of ism properties for each gmc .",
    "in particular , we derive density and kinetic temperature of molecular gas using @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "then , we discuss the relationship among gas density , kinetic temperature , star formation activity , and their evolution of molecular clouds comprehensively .",
    "however , we can not accurately obtain @xmath3 in the gmc - c because @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) line emission is distributed beyond the mapped area .",
    "therefore , we exclude the gmc - c in further discussion .      in order to obtain physical properties of molecular gas , such as its density and kinetic temperature , we employed the lvg approximation ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "when we perform the lvg calculation , we have to assume some input parameters ; the molecular abundances @xmath44co ) = [ @xmath2co]/[h@xmath45 , [ @xmath0co]/[@xmath2co ] , and the velocity gradient @xmath46 .",
    "first , we fix the abundance [ @xmath0co]/[@xmath2co ] as 0.02 .",
    "then , we determine an appropriate @xmath44co ) value for ngc  604 based on earlier studies as follows .",
    "@xcite reported the standard relative molecular abundance as @xmath47co ) = @xmath48 in the galactic disk , which corresponds to @xmath44co ) = @xmath49 under the assumption of [ @xmath0co]/[@xmath2co ] = 0.02 .",
    "however , @xcite assumed a smaller value , @xmath44co ) = @xmath50 for lmc . in order to determine the appropriate @xmath44co ) value for ngc  604",
    ", we consider a difference in the metallicity among these objects ; our galaxy , lmc , and ngc  604 . reported metallicity values are 8.9 in solar neighborhood @xcite , 8.37 in lmc @xcite , and 8.51  8.60 in ngc  604 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since the metallicity in ngc  604 is between that in our galaxy and in lmc , we adopt an intermediate @xmath44co ) value , @xmath51 , for ngc  604 .",
    "in addition , we assume @xmath46 of 1.0 km s@xmath26 pc@xmath26 , because the sizes of molecular clouds detected with the nma is in the range of 5 to 29 pc @xcite , and typical velocity width in @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) line is @xmath14 20 km s@xmath26 .",
    "figure 6 shows results of the lvg calculations for the gmc - a and b. the black line indicates a curve of constant @xmath3 as functions of gas density and kinetic temperature , and the red line indicates that of constant @xmath5 . the usage of these two line ratios allows us to determine density , @xmath22 , and kinetic temperature , @xmath52 , of molecular gas at the point where two curves intersect each other .    for the gmc - a",
    ", we determined @xmath22 @xmath53 @xmath10 and @xmath52 = 22@xmath54  k as averaged values within the whole gmc .",
    "for the gmc - b , we determined @xmath22 @xmath55 @xmath10 and @xmath52 = 25@xmath122  k as averaged values within the whole gmc .",
    "in addition , we determined @xmath22 @xmath56 @xmath10 and @xmath52 = 33@xmath11  k at the @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) peak position of the gmc - b .",
    "generally , molecular gas whose density exceeding a few @xmath9 @xmath10 is classified into `` dense '' , and whose kinetic temperature exceeding 30  k is into `` warm '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the physical state of molecular gas averaged over the whole gmc - a is `` less dense and cool '' , that averaged over the whole gmc - b is `` dense and cool '' , and that at the peak position of the gmc - b is classified into `` dense and warm '' , respectively .",
    "these results suggest dense gas formation is ongoing in the whole gmc - b , while gas temperature is different within the gmc - b .",
    "note that the obtained physical properties of gmc - b in this study are different from those obtained by @xcite .",
    "the authors reported that gas density is 1  3 @xmath9 @xmath10 , which is consistent well with our results , whereas the reported temperature is 100  300 k , which is significantly higher than our results , @xmath14 30 k. this is because the authors used not @xmath5 but @xmath2co(@xmath4)/@xmath2co(@xmath18 ) for the lvg calculation .",
    "@xmath5 significantly differs among galaxies even which show similar @xmath2co(@xmath4)/@xmath2co(@xmath18 ) ratio ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the discrepancy in the derived temperature is caused by the usage of different line ratios , @xmath5 and @xmath2co(@xmath4)/@xmath2co(@xmath18 ) , for the lvg calculation .    here , we mention effects on our results of the lvg calculation when we adopt a different @xmath44co ) value .",
    "if we assume a smaller @xmath44co ) value , 3 @xmath57 , like lmc , the derived gas density increases by about 2.5 times , and the derived temperature drops @xmath14 15 k. if we assume a larger @xmath44co ) value , 5 @xmath58 , like galactic disks , the derived gas density typically decreases to one third , and the derived temperature typically increases by @xmath14 15 k. in addition , we estimate how derived gas density and temperature vary when we adopted a different [ @xmath0co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio as studied in @xcite .",
    "if we assume a smaller [ @xmath0co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio , 0.014 , the derived gas density increases by 1.5  2 times , and the derived temperatures drop @xmath14 10 k. if we assume a larger [ @xmath0co]/[@xmath2co ] abundance ratio , 0.033 , the derived gas density typically drops by half , and the derived temperature increases by @xmath14 10 k. however , relative difference in derived gas density between these gmcs is retained even if we adopted different @xmath44co ) value and [ @xmath0co]/[@xmath2co ] ratio . in other words ,",
    "determined gas density of gmc - b is still higher than that of gmc - a .",
    "we summarize line ratios and derived physical parameters for each gmc in table  2 .",
    "we discuss evolutional stages of molecular gas and star formation in ngc  604 according to the results of the lvg analysis .",
    "in particular , we focus on star formation properties in the gmc - b because we can easily compare our results with earlier studies .",
    "star formation properties in the gmc - b of ngc  604 have been studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "the authors examined distributions of @xmath5 and h@xmath21 emission .",
    "they found an arc - like high @xmath5 structure extending southward , and found that the high @xmath5 gas arc closely coincides with the shells of the h regions traced by h@xmath21 emission .",
    "this shell - shaped h regions are also displayed in figure  5 .",
    "they regard the high @xmath5 gas arc as dense - gas forming region , and finally suggest that dense gas formation progresses via the compression of surrounding molecular gas by the stellar winds and supernovae from young massive stars in h regions , and as a result , the dense gas and massive star formation propagates southward in ngc 604 ( @xcite ) .    according to fig.3 and fig.4 of @xcite ,",
    "the high @xmath5 region widely spreads compared to the shell - shaped h regions .",
    "we compare spatial extent of dense gas forming region indicated by high @xmath5 ( @xmath36 0.7 ) arc and that of h regions with the integrated - intensity maps of @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) and @xmath2co(@xmath1 ) line emission in figure  7 .",
    "the dense gas forming region ( high @xmath5 arc ) covers most of the gmc - b , whereas h regions exist only in the northern part of this gmc .",
    "this picture is consistent well with our results of the lvg calculation ; the fact that derived gas density not only at the peak position of the gmc but also averaged over the whole gmc exceed @xmath13 @xmath10 suggests that dense molecular gas is formed everywhere in the gmc - b . on the other hand , kinetic temperature averaged over the whole gmc - b , 25  k , is lower than that at the peak position , 33  k. this is because h regions are lopsided to the northern part of the gmc - b , and then young massive ob stars can heat only the northern part , including the peak position , of this gmc .    in conclusion , this study based on multi - line co data and the lvg analysis in ngc  604 suggests that dense molecular gas is formed everywhere in the gmc - b , whereas warm molecular gas , whose kinetic temperature exceeds 30  k , exists only in the northern part of the gmc - b . since h regions traced by strong h@xmath21 emission are confined in the northern part of the gmc - b , we conclude that young massive ob stars in this h regions play a key role in heating of neighboring molecular gas locally .",
    "our results support the scenario of the sequential star formation proposed by @xcite ; i.e. , we revealed that the southern part of the gmc - b is in the dense - gas forming phase as predicted by this scenario .",

    "4 .   we concluded that dense molecular gas is formed everywhere in the gmc - b because derived gas density not only at the peak position of the gmc but also averaged over the whole gmc exceeds @xmath13 @xmath10 , on the other hand , kinetic temperature averaged over the whole gmc - b , 25  k , is lower than that at the peak position , 33  k. this is because h regions are lopsided to the northern part of the gmc - b , and then young massive ob stars can heat only the northern part , including the peak position , of this gmc .",
