    "these lines could not be assigned to any known species and no other similar patterns were found in the iso far - infrared spectrum of irc+10216 .",
    "we have checked for all pure rotational lines of light species that could be potentially abundant without success .",
    "hence , the only possible explanation is that the feature corresponds to a bending mode of an abundant heavy molecule , and most likely to a carbon chain .",
    "we searched for the same feature toward other objects selected from the same criteria of our previous searches of c@xmath5 , c@xmath3h@xmath10 , c@xmath7h@xmath10 , and benzene ( cernicharo et al .",

    "all the spectra have been analyzed using the iso spectrometers data reduction package isap@xmath20 .",
    "the data products correspond to version 10 of the pipeline .",
    "a polynomial baseline had to be removed from the final spectrum in each source .",
    "for some objects this baseline removal is critical to correctly extract the shape and intensity of the absorption features . due to the large number of lines in sgr b2 m and n spectra ,",
    "the determination of the continuum level is not obvious . for sources with emission lines ,",
    "although baseline removal is less critical , the global behavior of detector sw2 does not follow the expected shape for continuum emission and a polynomial of fourth degree has been removed after blanking the wavelength intervals where features above 5 sigma were present .",
    "figure 1 shows the 53 - 62 @xmath0 m spectra of the selected sources .",
    "we have also analyzed the available observations for several other sources : o - rich stars , orion , sgr a , bright molecular sources , and even mars to check for possible instrumental effects .",
    "the new infrared feature was not detected in any of these sources .",
    "we have also examined the spectral response of the lws - sw2 filter in order to check for possible instrumental contributions to the blend of lines found around 57 @xmath0 m but there is nothing at this wavelength ( garcia  lario , private communication ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that the blend of lines is real . the pure rotational lines of co and hcn are indicated in the top panel of figure 1 . the model of cernicharo et al .",
    "( 1996 ) predicted a low flux for these high - j lines . only in irc+10216 some of the co lines ( j=43 - 42 ,",
    "44 - 43 and 45 - 44 ) are marginally detected at a 3@xmath21 level .",
    "the observed band consists of a blend of at least 4 spectral lines or sub - bands ( at 57.0 , 57.6 , 57.9 and 58.2 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "there is an additional feature separated from the band at 56.15 @xmath0 m that is detected in c - rich evolved stars but is less evident in sgr b2 n and m. the j=47 - 46 line of co could only make a modest contribution to this feature in c - rich evolved stars since other high - j co lines are weak  even in irc+10216 . in sgr",
    "b2 m this feature is blended with the absorption produced by nh@xmath5 ( j=9 - 8 ) .",
    "the 56.15 @xmath0 m feature could be one of the fine structure lines of [ si ] at 56.31 @xmath0 m ( @xmath22p@xmath23@xmath22p@xmath24 ) but its companion [ si ] ( @xmath22p@xmath24@xmath22p@xmath10 ) line at 25.249 @xmath0 m is missing in all objects",
    ". the feature could also be the r(1 ) line of hd .",
    "however , it is unlikely to find such a high intensity for this line in evolved stars .",
    "we think , that if instrumental , the feature could arise from uranus , the planet used as calibrator for the lws / grating spectrometer .",
    "however , its intensity changes by more than a factor 10 between ngc7027 and irc+10216 or crl618 ( the continuum flux at 58 @xmath0 m is nearly the same for ngc7027 and crl618 , 1.15 and 0.7  10@xmath25 w @xmath26m@xmath27 respectively , and 4 and 3 10@xmath25 w @xmath26m@xmath27 for irc+10216 and crl2688 respectively ) .",
    "therefore , the 56.2 @xmath0 m feature in irc+10216 , crl618 , ngc7027 and crl2688 can not be explained alone by a possible instrumental contribution from the calibrator .",
    "figure 1 shows that the 56.2 @xmath0 m line follows the intensity of the 57 - 58 @xmath0 m features . in the following",
    "we will consider that all them belongs to the same molecular band .",
    "two additional features at 53.7 and 54.4 @xmath0 m in the spectrum of irc+10216 ( labelled u1 and u2 in the top panel of figure 1 ) , and another one at 52.89 @xmath0 m ( not shown ) , are also detected in ngc7027 but not in the other sources .",
    "these three lines remain , so far , unidentified .",
    "the contribution of oh ( goicoechea & cernicharo 2002 ) and the maximum possible contribution from h@xmath10o ( cernicharo et al . 2002 , in preparation ) to the spectra of sgr b2 n and m are indicated in the panel corresponding to sgr b2 m. the contribution of h@xmath10o to the spectrum of crl618 at 58@xmath0 m is negligible ( herpin and cernicharo 2000 ) .",
    "the fact that the 58 @xmath0 m feature is detected in all the selected c - rich post - agb objects clearly points toward a carbon - rich molecule as the carrier of the band .",
    "several molecules with four atoms have low frequency bending modes around 160 - 220 @xmath1 .",
    "hc@xmath5n has a low energy bending mode , @xmath4 , at 222.413 @xmath1 ( @xmath1445 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "dyacetylene , c@xmath3h@xmath10 , recently detected in crl618 with a very large abundance ( see cernicharo et al .",
    "2001a&b ) , has a low energy bending mode , @xmath28 , also at @xmath1445 @xmath0 m .",
    "another example of molecule with bending modes in this wavelength range is c@xmath3h .",
    "pure rotational lines from the @xmath29 bending states of c@xmath3h have been detected in irc+10216 by gulin et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and yamamoto et al .",
    "the frequency of this mode is expected from ab initio calculations ( graf et al .",
    "2001 ) to be around 178 @xmath1 .",
    "yamamoto et al . (",
    "1987 ) have estimated a frequency of 131 @xmath1 from the l - doubling constant , q@xmath8 , of the @xmath4=1,2 vibrational levels .",
    "a 20% of error could be expected on this value ( mikami et al .",
    "photoelectron spectra of c@xmath3h indicated , however , a larger frequency for this mode ( 226 @xmath1 ; taylor et al .",
    "the low lying @xmath30 electronic state of c@xmath3h is at @xmath31468 @xmath1 above the ground ( taylor et al .",
    "both transitions , the @xmath32 and the electronic @xmath33 are in the wavelength coverage of the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) on - board iso .",
    "however , irc+10216 is so bright in the mid - infrared that the expected range for these transitions is covered by strong ripples and not obvious features have been found so far ( cernicharo et al .",
    "the shape of the band in figure 1 allows to rule out a @xmath34 transition , i.e. , the bending modes of hc@xmath5n , hc@xmath6n , c@xmath11h@xmath10 with n even , c@xmath11 with n odd , etc .",
    "these molecules have a @xmath35 ground electronic state and , at the limited resolution of the lws grating spectrometer , a strong q - branch with weak p and r - branches are expected for their bending modes .",
    "the hc@xmath5n @xmath4 and c@xmath3h@xmath10 @xmath28 modes are present in the lws spectrum of crl618 ( to be published elsewhere ) , and correspond to these expectations .",
    "taking into account the large abundance of c@xmath5 found in sgr b2 and irc+10216 , c@xmath3 could be a good candidate to explain the ir feature under investigation .",
    "linear c@xmath3 was first observed in the laboratory using electron spin resonance spectroscopy of carbon clusters in matrices by graham et al .",
    "they were able to derive the spin - coupling and spin - doubling constants , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , for the ground vibrational state .",
    "c@xmath3 was first detected and characterized in the gas phase by heath and saykally ( 1991 ) by observing several ro - vibrational lines of the @xmath38 antisymmetric stretching mode .",
    "moazzen - ahmadi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) observed the same band and the @xmath39 hot band and determined the rotational constants , b and d , for both the ground and the @xmath2 states .",
    "the l - doubling constant , q@xmath6 , for the latter vibrational state was also derived leading these authors to estimate a frequency of 160@xmath404 @xmath1 for the @xmath2 mode .",
    "the @xmath2 bending mode of c@xmath3 has been measured in matrix experiments at a wavelength of 58 @xmath0 m ( withey et al .",
    "1991 ) , very close to that of the newly found ir feature .",
    "they observed two different lines separated by 2 @xmath1 ( 170 and 172.4 @xmath1 ) that they interpreted as two different trapping sites for c@xmath3 in the ar matrix .",
    "both values could correspond to the frequency of the @xmath2 mode of c@xmath3 but the authors adopted the value of 172.4 @xmath1 .",
    "this value agrees well with the series of peaks observed in the photoelectron spectroscopy of arnold et al .",
    "the difference between the frequency of the new ir band and that derived from the matrix experiments is 2.6 @xmath1 , which could be consistent with a frequency shift introduced by the ar matrix of 1.5% .",
    "ab initio calculations predict wavenumbers in the 175 - 214 @xmath1 range ( 47 - 57 @xmath0 m ) and an infrared intensity of 46.2 km mol@xmath27 [ a(@xmath41 ) @xmath14 0.25 s@xmath27 ; martin et al .",
    "1991 ; watts et al . 1992",
    "; taylor and martin , 1996 ; see also van orden and saykally , 1998 ] . due to the complexity of the c@xmath3 electronic energy levels and to the limited accuracy level of ab initio calculations , this intensity value has to be taken into account as a crude estimation .",
    "the fact that the observed band ( see figure 1 ) contains several spectral features suggests a transition between terms of higher spin multiplicity , in particular toward a vibronic transition @xmath42 or @xmath43 , i.e. , just the type of bands we can expect for c@xmath3h and c@xmath3 which have @xmath44 and @xmath45 ground electronic states respectively .",
    "consequently the lowest bending modes of these species , @xmath4 for c@xmath3h and @xmath2 for c@xmath3 , will have @xmath30 and @xmath46 vibronic character respectively .",
    "an argument against c@xmath3h is the following , while pure rotational lines of its bending mode have been detected towards irc+10216 ( gulin et al .",
    "1987 ; yamamoto et al .",
    "1987 ) these lines are missing in all other objects reported here ( except in crl618 where several weak lines from these states have been detected ; cernicharo et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "moreover , the abundance of c@xmath3h in sgr b2 is rather low ( gulin , mezaoui & friberg , 1982 ) , while c@xmath5 has a large abundance ( cernicharo , goicoechea and caux , 2000 ) .",
    "hence , it is tempting to assume that the observed features in post - agb stars and in the ism correspond to the @xmath2 mode of c@xmath3 , although a definitive assignment will require better spectral resolution data and/or additional laboratory information on this species .",
    "the main problem in assigning the band to the @xmath2 mode of c@xmath3 is the large spin - orbit interaction constant , a@xmath47 , that should have the @xmath46 vibronic state in order to reproduce the observations . as the ground electronic state of c@xmath3",
    "is @xmath48 , a very small value for a@xmath47 should be expected . however",
    ", if the molecule has a low lying excited electronic state with @xmath49 , then the ground and the excited states will be strongly coupled through vibronic mixing and a large spin - orbit constant could be expected .",
    "this is the case for cch which has a @xmath44 ground state and an a@xmath30 state 3600 @xmath1 above .",
    "the @xmath16 bending mode of the ground electronic state has a@xmath500.3 @xmath1 . for c@xmath3h",
    ", a@xmath47 is very large , @xmath143 @xmath1 ( yamamoto et al . 1987 ) , because its a@xmath30 state is only @xmath14468 @xmath1 above the @xmath44 ground state ( see above ) .",
    "for c@xmath3 the situation could be very similar to that of c@xmath3h as its first excited electronic state is @xmath51 and is only 2680 @xmath1 above the ground electronic @xmath48 state ( arnold et al .",
    "1991 ; xu et al .",
    "last panel in figure 1 shows the computed band shape for a@xmath47=4 @xmath1 at different temperatures .",
    "the similarity between the observed and computed shape is appealing .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the adopted spin - orbit constant is particulary large .",
    "we have run several models with different a@xmath47 values and conclude that the shape of the band is only crudely reproduced for a@xmath522 @xmath1 .",
    "another possibility that may explain the complexity of the band shape and allows smaller a@xmath47 values is that @xmath53cccc and c@xmath53ccc isotopomers also make a remarkable contribution to the observed emission .",
    "this could also apply to c@xmath3h if finally this molecule is confirmed as the carrier .",
    "we note , however , that in this case we should also expect a very large column density of c@xmath3h , which looks incompatible with the upper limits found for this molecule in sgr b2 ( gulin , friberg and mezaoui 1982 )",
    ". if the carrier is c@xmath3 then the column density will be particularly large in all observed sources . assuming a vibrational excitation temperature of 50 - 100 k in agb stars and ppns , n(c@xmath3 ) has to be close to 10@xmath54 @xmath55 , i.e. , a typical abundance of a few 10@xmath56 - 10@xmath57 .",
    "in sgr b2 the computed column density ( assuming a lower vibrational excitation temperature ) is 1.2 10@xmath58 @xmath55 , i.e. , similar to that derived by cernicharo , goicoechea and caux ( 2000 ) for c@xmath5 .",
    "the accuracy of the band intensity from ab initio calculations dominates the error in the estimated column densities .    future space ",
    "born platforms , such as the herschel space observatory , will be equipped with heterodyne instruments with much better spectral resolution which should permit the detection of longer c@xmath11 chains through their low lying bending modes in the far  ir .",
    "the detection of these molecules and the determination of their abundances will allow to stablish their role in the formation of the carriers of the unidentified infrared bands .",
    "waiting for herschel , important work has to be done in spectroscopy laboratories to fully characterize these molecular species .",
