    "we have previously shown for a conductance - based neural model of striatal medium spiny neurons that neuronal variability in the contribution of individual ion channels ( such as slowly inactivating potassium channels and girk channels ) can yield uniform responses , if the neurons are driven with sufficiently strong synaptic input fluctuations ( see @xcite ) . if the same neurons are driven by more distributed synaptic input , they show variability in their response pattern , such as spike timing and spike rates .",
    "these different statistical properties of synaptic input can be modeled by a variability in the correlation properties of input neurons .",
    "i.e. driving neurons by correlated vs. uncorrelated input leads to uniform behavior vs. read - out of stored differences in ion channel conductances .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall explore the effect of different network topologies on the statistics of synaptic input received at individual model neurons .",
    "the hypothesis is that certain topologies create more synchronized input volleys than others .",
    "the conductance - based neural model of striatal medium spiny neurons is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the membrane voltage @xmath0 is modeled using the equation @xmath1\\ ] ] where the @xmath2 are the currents , induced by the individual ion channels .",
    "variability of the neuron is modeled by modifications to @xmath3 .",
    "this model includes ion channels for na ( @xmath4 ) , k ( @xmath5 ) , slow a - type k channels ( @xmath6 ) , fast a - type k channels ( @xmath7 ) , inward rectifying k channels ( @xmath8 ) , l - type calcium channels ( @xmath9 ) , and the leak current ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the definition of all parameters and the dynamics of the ion channels can be found in @xcite .    for the experiments in this paper ,",
    "we only focus on variability , induced by changes in the strength of the slow a - type k channels . the total current contribution for these channels",
    "is @xmath11 where @xmath12 was selected between 1.0 and 1.5 .    in order to illustrate the variability in neuron behavior",
    ", we excited the neuron model by input signals , resembling two kinds of synaptic input : uncorrelated and correlated .",
    "these signals were generated by superposition of excitatory and inhibitory spikes generated by individual poisson - distributed spike trains ( 50 excitatory and 10 inhibitory ) , and biased gaussian background noise .",
    "the amount of pairwise correlation in these spike trains governed the type of input signal . a high correlation factor was used to generate sequences with distinct short periods ( 10 - 15ms ) of high activity .      in order to do large - scale simulation",
    "we need to employ a simple , computationally tractable neuron model .",
    "we use a two - dimensional model of a neural oscillator ( cf . morris - lecar model , fitzhugh - nagumo model , @xcite ) .",
    "we employ an instantiation of the model with parameters fitted to the general properties of cortical pyramidal neurons ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this model consists of an equation for the membrane model @xmath13 ( eq .  [ eq1 ] ) , fitted to experimental values for cortical pyramidal neurons ( eq .  [ eq1 ] ) , and an equation for a gating parameter @xmath14 ( eq .  [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath15    @xmath16    when the neuron fires a spike ( defined as @xmath17 ) , @xmath13 is set back to a low membrane potential @xmath18 and the gating variable @xmath14 is increased by a fixed amount @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . this formulation allows a very simple neuron model , which avoids the explicit modeling of the downslope of the action potential , and rather resets the voltage .",
    "time - dependence is modeled by the gating variable @xmath14 .",
    "neuronal variability is achieved by systematic variation of inactivation parameters . by varying @xmath19",
    ", we can vary the inactivation dynamics of the model after a spike , by varying @xmath22 we vary the inactivation dynamics throughout the computation . in this way , we can attempt to model neuronal variability in activation / inactivation dynamics , which is sufficient to model frequency - selectivity as an example of a stored intrinsic property ( see table [ param ] ) .",
    ".parameters for different neuron types [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ random456 ] , we see the randomly connected graph ( rg1 ) with the same initial stimulation . background inhibition is the same as before .",
    "visual inspections suggests asynchronous behavior .",
    "pairwise correlation should be lower than before , at least between different types .",
    "again , fig .",
    "[ 5000-rnd ] shows the full simulation .",
    "the degree of frequency - specificity can be assessed by the average and standard deviation for isis , as shown in the gaussian . except for the generic neuron @xmath23 ,",
    "we get separated frequencies , even though the neuronal types have not been optimized for this task .",
    "the pairwise synchronicity @xmath24 could be shown to be fairly independent of the properties and frequency - selectivity of the neuron .",
    "this is in accordance with the observation that differences in intrinsic properties disappear as the synchronicity in a network increases . instead",
    "@xmath24 is dominated by the type of network connectivity .",
    "if there is a phase transition in synchronicity during a gradual transformation of the graph structure , this would indicate a self - organized switch between time - locked behavior and read - out .",
    "let us explain a certain case in the model : if neuron a receives less organized synaptic input , its intrinsic properties will determine its firing rate more .",
    "it will be more of a `` driver '' neuron , whose stored properties determine its output . if the same neuron a receives synaptic input that puts it more into a `` driven '' mode , its behavior will be more like that of a `` transfer '' ( resonator ) neuron , or in other words , a more uniform processing device that transmits information according to a simple transfer function",
    "small differences in intrinsic properties are interesting for models of memorization , because they allow conditional read - out of information .",
    "this means that neurons may acquire differences in their ion channel distribution and density in a use - dependent way , storing aspects of previous activations .",
    "this memory , however , is not always present to influence all types of processing .",
    "rather , it is conditionally present , i.e. it requires specific conditions to be `` read - out '' .",
    "this observation provides a new perspective on the role of neuronal circuits in encapsulating memory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "difference in neuronal read - out may not be restricted to synaptic input that is highly correlated vs. more distributed .",
    "another type of synaptic input that has been shown to influence variability in neuronal spiking behavior is balance of inhibitory and excitatory input .",
    "this is another method of influencing the state of the neuron such that it either responds only to strong synaptic input , i.e. exists in a mode where its output is determined by synaptic input ( in a low balance , low inhibitory state ) , or exists in a state where it is close to firing threshold ( or `` high - conductance state '' ) .",
    "if we assume a model neuron with a certain type of nonlinear dynamics , then the synaptic input in this balanced state becomes a form of turbulence that causes a neuron to emit spikes according to its own stored intrinsic properties .",
    "when we have frequency - encoding neurons with different rates and a tendency to fire regularly when stimulated by noisy , asynchronous network activity , we can use these neurons for a form of `` symbolic '' encoding ( i.e. assigning different symbols to the frequencies ) .",
    "we need to take the existing variability concerning the regularity ( the standard deviation ) in our model into account , plus the observation that the deviation is larger for sequences of 1000 ms or less , but fairly small for larger sequences such as 5000 ms or more .",
    "however , it should not be difficult to build reliable storage devices based on a distribution of deviations / frequencies such as for the given model neurons .     and @xmath25 .",
    ", width=226 ]    as an example , consider the subgraph displayed in fig .",
    "[ trees ] . when activated at point @xmath26 , assuming a traveling wave in three steps , and assuming different frequencies for @xmath27 and @xmath25",
    ", we would get a schema as in fig .",
    "[ schema ] , which would result in different actual timings , depending on a number of additional variables .    .",
    "the actual distribution of spike timings could vary considerably.,width=226 ]    we can also combine neurons in specific arrays ( possibly including delays ) and thus generate specific regularly repeatable spike - time patterns . as a matter of fact , using frequencies as symbols and then stimulating specific neurons such that sequences of neurons are being activated will generate spike - time patterns as mixtures of symbols    it is entirely possible that this model does not capture reality very well .",
    "it would predict that certain neurons in a group fire with a specified frequency , when they receive distributed synaptic input , but join in a time - locked firing mode at other times . this would be difficult to establish empirically .",
    "the spike firing patterns that we can create with this basic generation model are so various that it should be possible to match them to existing recordings in any case ( such as @xcite ) .",
    "there is no doubt that this basic model raises further interesting questions .",
    "when a pattern of activity is activated in a certain brain area , this may drive synchronized activity , time - locked to this pattern in other brain areas .",
    "any actual read - out requires not only a localized activation pattern , but also mechanisms for recruitment of other neurons and enhancement of the pattern by ( synchronized ) neural activity .",
    "similarly , the question as to how the information is encoded from ongoing network activity into individual neurons is also not answered here .",
    "we may also consider the question of whether a neuron can not simultaenously respond to an input and read out its stored pattern .",
    "this would be the case for phase delay or advance by selective individual inputs .",
    "( the impact of such phase delays or advances is different if these are single events , in which case they only distort a specific processing event , or if they amount to phase resetting ; or even to phase resetting with continuation at a different frequency . )",
    "there may also be other modes of combining input sensitivity with stored properties .",
    "the results we obtained were done with two - dimensional neurons , as models of cortical pyramidal neurons .",
    "we used both a generic model , and parametrization according to a few distinct types . in this way",
    ", we can demonstrate a `` symbolic '' property of storage in distinct frequencies that a neuron emits , when stimulated in a noisy , distributed way",
    ". nonetheless it could be interesting to perform simulations with more continuous variability over a range of parameters .",
    "we expect synchronization properties to be largely unaffected by this",
    ". the interesting question would be to interpret more continuous frequency ranges , if these exist .",
    "the synchronization measures given in this graph are not further modulated by rhythmically structured , fast inhibitory spiking .",
    "we did not discuss feedforward inhibition by fast - spiking interneurons , which are usually assumed to play an important role in narrow synchronization for high - frequency ( @xmath28 ) oscillations .",
    "this is an open question for further research .",
    "we have not systematically varied the amount of excitatory / inhibitory background noise , nor specific types of background activity beyond white noise - the interactions with the results presented here could be suggestive .",
    "we have worked with short - term synaptic stimulation and additional background noise to keep activity going .",
    "there is thus `` re - entrant '' self - supporting activity to the driven input .",
    "it is possible to put the network into a mode where the total activity is too low to support ongoing activity and the network needs ongoing outside input . in this case",
    "the self - organization properties reported here would undergo qualified alterations .",
    "for instance , input to hubs could have different results than input to other neurons .",
    "changes of overall activity level in the network could also differ with changes in topology , and they would invoke homeostatic ( control ) corrections to keep activity constant .",
    "we also need to clarify the relationship between synaptic strength of in - and outputs and degree of in- and outputs",
    ". the effective connectivity of a neuron can be defined by a combination of synaptic strength and degree of connectivity .",
    "we will thus arrive at capacitated graphs , i.e. the graph structure is `` implemented '' by synaptic weights onto link connectivity . based on experimental estimates on the distribution of presynaptic receptors",
    ", we may also assume that each topology change incorporates between 10 - 20% of connections .",
    "the concept of sw graphs in this context needs to be further explored .",
    "potentially important features which need to be quantified to be employed as measures are for instance the incidence of recurrent loops and the incidence of laterality under the assumption of a clustering of a sw graph into imperfect trees ( hierarchical clusters ) .",
    "differential stimulation to prime neurons ( hubs ) vs. subsidiary neurons ( leaves ) in a swg also needs to be explored .",
    "this has implications for information storage ( see [ symbolic ] as well ) .",
    "we have made some progress in this paper in clarifying the relationship between intrinsic frequency encoding , synchronization and a generic model of small - world networks .",
    "applications to a real model of cortico - striatal interactions are planned . also , some of the questions raised may merit further systematic treatment .                     to uncorrelated input",
