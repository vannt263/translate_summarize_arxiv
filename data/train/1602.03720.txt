    "excitons in quantum wells ( qws ) are extensively studied already for four decades  @xcite .",
    "theoretical analysis of the excitons typically assumes a simplified model for the qw potential , e.g. , square profiles for electrons and holes  @xcite .",
    "real potential , however , is more complex due to several processes occurring during the growth of heterostructures . in the narrow qws ,",
    "the monolayer fluctuations of interfaces give rise to fluctuations of the qw width .",
    "these fluctuations result in the step - like changes of the exciton quantization energy experimentally observed as a set of exciton resonances in optical spectra  @xcite .",
    "the diffusion of atoms through the qw interface ( segregation ) during the growth process gives rise to smoothing and an asymmetry of potential profiles for carriers  @xcite .",
    "the specially designed asymmetric qws are also extensively studied in view of their interesting properties , e.g. , large electron spin - orbit splitting  @xcite , enhanced optical nonlinearity  @xcite and coupling with terahertz radiation  @xcite .",
    "exciton energy and wave function are sensitive to the potential profile .",
    "however the direct experimental observation of effects of the profile peculiarities on the exciton properties is difficult for several reasons .",
    "the exciton energy shift relative to the theoretically predicted value may be caused , apart from the modification of potential profile , by uncertainties in the qw width and in the composition of solid solution in the layers within the heterostructure .",
    "various imperfections of the heterostructure like point defects , dislocations , etc . , may broaden the exciton ensemble and complicate the study of exciton energies .",
    "the exciton wave function determines the exciton - light coupling , in particular , the oscillator strength and the radiative decay rate , which can be studied by reflectance spectroscopy and in the time - resolved experiments  @xcite .",
    "these are the integral characteristics , which are insensitive to peculiarities of potential profile for each particular exciton transition . at the same time",
    ", these difficulties can be overcome when several exciton transitions in the same qw are experimentally studied and analyzed .    in this paper we experimentally study and theoretically analyze reflectance spectra of heterostructures with asymmetric ingaas / gaas qws .",
    "we demonstrate that the simultaneous analysis of several exciton resonances in the spectra of relatively wide qws allows one to obtain valuable information about the potential profile for the excitons .",
    "we have developed an approach for the direct numerical solution of schrdinger equation for an exciton in a qw with an arbitrary potential profile .",
    "the coulomb electron - hole interaction in the exciton is exactly included into the numerical approach with no approximations .",
    "calculations of the exciton energies and wave functions allowed us to accurately model reflectance spectra with the use of only two fitting parameters describing the maximal indium content in the qw and the characteristic length of the indium diffusion .",
    "both these parameters can not be controlled during the growth of heterostructires with the high enough accuracy required for the modeling .",
    "the obtained agreement allowed us to reliable model the potential profile for excitons in the heterustructures under study .",
    "the paper has the following structure .",
    "first we present experimental details and obtained reflectance spectra . a generalization of phenomenological theory of exciton - light coupling for the case of several exciton resonances in a qw with arbitrary potential profile",
    "is given in the next section .",
    "then we compare experimental results and microscopic modeling of the exciton states .",
    "finally we sum up major results in the conclusion .",
    "we have experimentally studied reflectance spectra of several ingaas / gaas heterostructures grown by the molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) .",
    "two of the structures with the smallest inhomogeneous broadening of exciton resonances have been selected for detailed investigation .",
    "the first one ( s1 ) contains a nominally square qw of 95-nm width with small indium content of about 2% grown between the gaas barrier layer .",
    "the second structure , s2 , is the specially designed asymmetric ingaas / gaas qw with one vertical potential wall and other sloping potential wall . in all the structures , effects of the qw asymmetry",
    "are found in the comparative study of exciton resonances observed in reflectance spectra .",
    "the spectra have been measured using a femtosecond ti : sapphire laser or a halogen lamp as a light source . in the latter case ,",
    "the light was focused onto a 50-@xmath0 m pin - hole and then refocused onto the sample .",
    "the light was directed to the samples at small angle close to the normal incidence .",
    "the light spots on the samples were of about 100  @xmath0 m in both cases .",
    "the samples were held in a vacuum chamber of a closed cycle cryostat at @xmath1  k. the reflected light was dispersed in a 0.55  m spectrometer with the 1800 grooves / mm grating and detected by a nitrogen cooled ccd - matrix .",
    "the spectral resolution was of about 30  @xmath0ev . to obtain the absolute value of reflectivity , the reflectance coefficient was carefully measured for a single wavelength nearby an exciton resonance using a beam of a continuous wave ti : sapphire laser focused at the same spot on the sample .",

    "[ flo : figure1 ] and [ flo : figure2 ] , respectively . for sample s1 ,",
    "four exciton resonances are clearly seen , two of them as the peaks and two others as the dips .",
    "the resonances correspond to optical transitions to the quantum confined excition states in the 95-nm qw . as we discuss in the next section , the different profile of the resonances ( peak or dip ) is due to the different phase shift in the light wave reflected form the qw at different exciton frequencies .    in the spectrum of sample s2 ,",
    "three similar exciton transitions are clearly seen as the resonances .",
    "the profiles of these resonances are more complex and contain valuable information about the phase shifts of light wave in this highly asymmetric qw .    the simplified potential profile for excitons in this qw is shown as an inset in fig .  2 . the vertical wall of the qw was formed during the growth by rapid opening of the in effusion cell held at @xmath2 @xmath3c .",

    "<S> perfect agreement of the phenomenological fit to the experimentally observed exciton spectra for high - quality structures allowed us to obtain reliable parameters of the exciton resonances including the exciton transition energies , the radiative broadenings , and the phase shifts . </S>",
    "<S> a direct numerical solution of schrdinger equation for the heavy - hole excitons in asymmetric qws is used for microscopic modeling of the exciton resonances . </S>",
