    "some twenty years after gdel gave the first proof of its completeness result ( see @xcite for an english translation of the original paper ) , henkin ( @xcite ) found a substantially different strategy to prove it , giving an alternative approach which has become standard in the exposition of the subject , see for example @xcite .",
    "the latter treatment inspired the present one .",
    "in particular the proof mechanism of [ teosatisfiability ] is unchanged .",
    "+ what has been changed is the derivation of [ propsatisfiability ] , which is the main result ; it is given in a quite different way , attentive to the economy of derivation rules . as a consequence",
    ", it is shown that satisfiability theorem , which is the key for completeness in all the arguments known to author ( gdel s included ) , requires one rule less than completeness .",
    "+ in other words , the rule set large enough to prove any true statement has one rule more than the rule set large enough that it can be enlarged without making any consistent set of formula inconsistent : compare [ propcompletenesswrtconsistency ] with [ theocompleteness ] . +",
    "and anyway , the completeness theorem can inherently be proven according to a set of basic deduction rules ( listed in [ tenrules ] ) which lacks `` proof by cases '' rule , and then cut - rule , which is derived from it ( see @xcite , iv.3.2 ) , right from the start .",
    "+ as a byproduct , this led to a careful reformulation of consistency - related definitions , and to a generalization of the construction of henkin for the model of a given consistent set of formula to the generic free interpretation and quotient construction ( and ) . +",
    "further , a reformulation of first - order logic syntax and semantics in term of semigroups is given in [ sectsyntax ] and [ sectsemantics ] .",
    "a plus of this approach is that definitions and some proofs get shorter and compact , albeit arguably obscuring the intuitive meaning of things , which is what standard treatment is based on . + all these addictional results are relegated to appendix so as not to obscure the main result .",
    "+ for yet alternative proofs of this same cornerstone result , the reader can see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "in sections [ sectsyntax ] and [ sectsemantics ] , syntax and semantics have been formalized . here a formalization of deductive proofing is set up . all along the tractation of completeness theorem , we fix the symbols set @xmath1 and the variable symbols set @xmath2 and explicitly require them both to be at most countable .",

    "rule number @xmath13      the rules given in [ tenrules ] have a role similar to that of construction rules for @xmath14 and @xmath15 seen in [ termsandformulas ] : the former decree which sequents are admitted in proofs , the latter ruled what strings of symbols are accepted to make computations on , and were built with syntactical conformity in mind , so to filter exactly the formulas that other authors call well - formed to emphasize the point . correspondingly , the first requisite one expects from derivation rules is that any formula derived from true assumption must be true as well , i.e. that basic derivation rules are correct . checking that this is indeed the case for our basic rules is straightforward but tedious ;",
    "let us just state a fundamental consequence :    [ theoconsistency ] any satisfiable set of formulas is consistent .",
    "formal definition of consistency is to come in [ sectionconsistency ] , anyway this should not pose a problem for some informal motivational discussion . the proof of [ theoconsistency ] is much easier than that of its reverse ( satisfiability theorem , [ teosatisfiability ] ) , which is done below . a first symptom of the trickiness involved : if one looks at [ theoconsistency ] s statement , there s no ambiguity in it , in that the declared consistency holds irrespective of the deduction rules adopted ; one can add or subtract arbitrary deduction rules and , provided they are correct , [ theoconsistency ] stands still .    on the other hand ,",
    "if faced with statement `` any consistent set of formulas is satisfiable '' , one may well , and should , ask : `` consistent according to what derivation rules ? '' . + we shall later see , indeed , that every basic rule ( except [ nctrrule ] which is used only for the easy derivation , from [ teosatisfiability ] , of the stronger completeness theorem , [ theocompleteness ] ) is needed along the proof , and this results in having to get fussy about always specifying according to which rules one is deriving .",
    "+ in particular , satisfiability theorem need all - around consistency for its thesis to hold , and is not granted to stand for weaker - consistent sets of formulas , simply because of the inability of finding some proof dispensing one of the basic rules .",
