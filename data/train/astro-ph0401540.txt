    "the observational facts collected over the last 40 years have demonstrated that the most massive ( @xmath1 ) star cluster in the halo of the galaxy , @xmath0  centauri , also shows the most surprising properties ever observed in a globular cluster .",
    "it is the only known galactic globular with a clear metallicity spread ( norris & da costa , 1995 ; smith et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "even more interesting , the abundance variations appear to be correlated with some peculiar structural and kinematical properties ( norris et al .",
    "1997 ; pancino et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "recent wide field photometric studies ( lee et al .",
    "1999 ; pancino et al .",
    "2000 ) have identified a previously unknown anomalous rgb sequence ( rgb - a ) , clearly separated from the bulk of the rgb population . the rgb - a photometric properties suggest a very high metal content , confirmed by spectroscopic follow - up ( [ fe / h]@xmath2 ; pancino et al .",
    "2002 ; origlia et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in a self - enrichment scenario , the rgb",
    "- a would belong to the last burst of star formation and should thus be younger than other populations in @xmath0  cen .",
    "however , using the photometry by pancino et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and the proper motions of van leeuwen et al ( 2000 ) , ferraro , bellazzini & pancino ( 2002 ) showed that the rgb - a stars have a coherent bulk motion with respect to the other cluster stars , suggesting that the rgb - a could be a captured component , now trapped in the potential well of the cluster .",
    "this evidence could eventually fit into a different scenario where the cluster is the remnant ( i.e. , the nucleus ) of a disrupting dwarf galaxy ( see bekki & freeman , 2003 ) , not dissimilar from the sagittarius case ( majewski et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we present the discovery of an additional anomalous sequence in the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of @xmath0  cen : a narrow sub giant branch ( sgb - a ) which merges into the main sequence ( ms ) of the cluster with a turn - off ( to ) significantly fainter than the dominant cluster population .",
    "this new feature adds another piece to the complex @xmath0  cen puzzle .",
    "the photometric data consist of a set of high resolution images obtained with fors1 at the vlt .",
    "all images were obtained ( in service mode ) between april and october 2002 , under very good seeing conditions ( fwhm@xmath3 ) , using the high - resolution fors1 imaging mode ( @xmath4pix ) that gives a field of view of @xmath5 .",
    "we covered a global @xmath6 area with a mosaic of @xmath7 pointings around the cluster center .",
    "each pointing consists of four deep b , v and i exposures , typically of 300 , 45 and 25s , complemented by a number of short exposures ( typically a few second long ) in order to properly measure the brightest stars .",
    "similar observations ( i.e similar strategy and spatial coverage ) were obtained on june 2002 with the _ advanced camera for survey _ ( acs ) on board hst through three filters [ namely f625w ( @xmath8 ) , f435w ( @xmath9 ) , f658n ( h@xmath10 ) ] within a programme devoted to the search for cataclysmic variables in @xmath0  cen .",
    "we retrieved three 340s exposures in the @xmath9 and @xmath8 filters for each of the nine pointings from the _ eso / st - ecf science archive_. two additional short exposures of 8 and 12s , in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands , respectively , were also retrieved in order to properly measure the brightest stars .",
    "both the fors1 and acs datasets have been reduced with daophot  ii ( stetson 1987 , 1994 ) using the same procedure . to optimize the search for faint objects",
    ", the source detection has been performed on the combined median image , obtained from the deepest exposures of each pointing .",
    "the list of detected objects in the combined image has then been fed to the psf - fitting routines of daophot and allstar that were run on each exposure , separately .",
    "each acs pointing was corrected for geometric distortions using the prescriptions by hack & cox ( 2001 ) .",
    "the resulting instrumental magnitudes have been converted into a common ( instrumental ) photometric system and averaged together .",
    "the final fors1 and acs instrumental catalogs have then been photometrically calibrated : the former , by using a large sample of stars in common with the wfi catalog by pancino et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( see also sollima et al .",
    "2004 for more details ) , while the latter has been transformed into the vega - mag system by using preliminary zero - points , kindly provided by g. de marchi ( private communication ) .",
    "figure [ fig : cmd1 ] shows the @xmath11 cmd obtained from the ground - based fors1 vlt observations .",
    "photometric errors have been calculated for each star from the r.m.s .",
    "scatter of repeated exposures . in order to minimize the probability of photometric contamination by nearby stars , only the 14,000 stars with the lowest photometric errors ( @xmath120.01 mag , see sollima et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) have been plotted .",
    "the complex structure of the rgb shows beautifully , but the most striking feature in this cmd is the additional , narrow sgb sequence , which sticks out of the main sgb - to region of the cluster .",
    "[ fig : cmd2 ] displays the @xmath13 cmd obtained from the hst / acs sample : more than 400000 stars with the lowest photometric errors are plotted .",
    "all the evolutionary sequences are extremely well defined , apart from the brightest giants that are saturated even in the shortest exposures ( not plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : cmd2 ] ) .",
    "the sgb - a is better defined than in the fors1 cmd , and the complex sgb / to structures are more clearly distinguishable . in this cmd , the sgb - a appears as the direct continuation of the rgb - a , although the presence of a number of stars located in between the main sgb and the sgb - a ( at @xmath14 ) offers room to other possible interpretations .",
    "the sgb - a sequence merges into the bulk of the cluster ms at a significantly fainter magnitude ( @xmath15mag ) with respect to the dominant population .",
    "sgb - a stars in common to both the fors1 and acs catalogs are marked in figure 1 .",
    "both the fors1 and acs cmds show that the ms - to of the sgb - a population ( @xmath16 ) is significantly fainter than the ms - to of the dominant cluster population ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "a hint of the presence of such a feature was already noted by anderson ( 2002 , see his fig .",
    "1 ) , in the core of the cluster on the basis of an instrumental @xmath18 cmd obtained from wfpc2/hst observations .",
    "however , the high quality cmds presented here provide the first clear - cut definition of this sequence in the cmd of @xmath0  cen .",
    "the to and sgb regions of @xmath0  cen show the same level of complexity already observed at the rgb level : _",
    "( i ) _  a well defined and populated main sgb sequence , highly homogeneous both in terms of age and metallicity .",
    "_ ( ii ) _ )  a more continuous distribution of stars toward the red , tracing a less homogeneous stellar component , with different metallicities and/or ages .",
    "_ ( iii ) _  a well defined narrow additional sgb , redder and fainter than the main sgb .",
    "the sharpness of this sequence strongly suggests a high degree of homogeneity in the age and metallicity of its stars .",
    "in the simplest scenario , the sgb - a is the extension of the rgb - a . following this hypothesis , we assume that the anomalous branches are constituted by the same population of metal - rich stars .",
    "we then performed a detailed comparison with theoretical models by using a set of theoretical isochrones calculated adopting the most up - to - date input physics ( straniero , chieffi & limongi 1998 ) .",
    "in particular , the equation of state includes the electrostatic correction ( see prada moroni & straniero 2002 , for a detailed description ) and microscopic diffusion ( gravitational settling and thermal diffusion ) .",
    "the theoretical isochrones have been transformed into the observational planes by means of the synthesis code described in origlia & leitherer ( 2000 ) , using the model atmospheres by bessell , castelli & plez ( 1998 ) .",
    "for the acs data set the filter responses and camera throughputs , kindly provided by the acs user support team , have been used .    in order to perform a meaningful comparison between theoretical isochrones and observed sequences , we need to adopt an average metallicity for each population . as discussed in previous papers ( see ferraro et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 and references therein ) an accurate comparison requires the use of the _ global metallicity _ , [ m / h ] , obtained by combining the classical [ fe / h ] abundance with the contribution of the @xmath19elements .",
    "detailed abundances for the different stellar populations in @xmath0  cen have been published by several authors ( see , e.g. , norris & da costa 1995 ; smith et al . 2000 ; vanture et al .",
    "2002 ) , including the recent studies on the rgb - a stars published by our group ( pancino et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ; origlia et al .",
    "these papers show that , while the metal poor populations at [ fe / h]@xmath20 turn out to be @xmath10-enhanced ( [ @xmath10/fe]@xmath21  dex ) compared to the solar values , the most metal rich one is only marginally @xmath10-enhanced [ @xmath10/fe]@xmath22  dex .    using the above values and",
    "the prescription by salaris , chieffi & straniero ( 1993 , see their eq .",
    "3 ) , we adopted a global metallicity [ m / h]@xmath23 ( or @xmath24 ) for the metal - poor , dominant population and [ m / h]@xmath2 ( or @xmath25 ) for the metal - rich population .",
    "the mean interstellar extinction coefficients listed in table 2 by savage & mathis ( 1979 ) have been adopted .    by best - fitting the @xmath24 isochrone to the metal - poor component",
    ", we obtained @xmath26 and @xmath27 and an age of @xmath28gyr .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the most recent determinations by thompson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and lub ( 2002 ) ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) and the most recent age determination by gratton at al .",
    "( 2003 ) . by using these values ,",
    "the position of the anomalous sgb has been compared with a set of @xmath25 isochrones in the 12 - 18 gyr age range .",
    "it is worth of mentioning that , since we are performing a strictly differential analysis between the sgb - a and the dominant cluster population , small uncertainties in the reddening and distance modulus would not affect the overall results .    as can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit1 ] , while the metal - poor population is reasonably well reproduced , the to level of the anomalous population is definitely fainter than what predicted by a metal - rich isochrone significantly younger ( @xmath31 ) than the dominant population .    a detailed analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig : fit1 ] shows that indeed the observed morphology of the anomalous sgb is not correctly reproduced by any @xmath25 isochrone , regardless of age .",
    "in fact , though the ms - to level of the anomalous population appears consistent with an age of 17 gyr , ( i.e. @xmath32 gyr older than the metal - poor component ) , the to color is significantly bluer than the corresponding isochrone .",
    "moreover , the morphology , extension and position of the lower rgb - a and sgb - a are not correctly reproduced , since _ 1 ) _  the sgb - a appears significantly less extended in color and much steeper than what predicted by a metal rich isochrone ( somewhat suggestive of a lower metal content ) ; _ 2 ) _  the position of the base of the rgb - a appears significantly bluer than what predicted by the isochrone .",
    "the same problems have been noted by fitting the sgb - a in the ( v , b - v ) plane .",
    "note that the same isochrone set nicely fits the sgb / to region of well - known clusters of similar metallicity ( as 47 tuc ) .",
    "other two parameters , namely the he and cno abundances can affect the location and shape of the sgb - to region in the cmd . in order to evaluate the effect of an enhanced he abundance over the shape of the sgb , we computed a set of suitable models at y=0.28 ( @xmath33 with respect to the standard value adopted above ) . from this models we noted that an increase of the he abundance does not significantly affect the to level while it decreases the sgb extension by moving blueward the location of the rgb by few hundredths of magnitude in the @xmath34 color .",
    "hence an increase of the he abundance can not be invoked to explain the faintness of the to of the anomalous population .",
    "renzini ( 1977 , see also the discussion in salaris , chieffi & straniero 1993 ) showed that the to luminosity and temperature primarily depend on the cno and ne abundances , while the rgb colors mainly depend on the fe , si and mg ones .",
    "thus an _ ad hoc _ increase of @xmath35 would _ ( i ) _  move the to color towards the red while leaving the rgb location unchanged , thus reducing the sgb extension and _ ( ii ) _  move the to towards fainter magnitudes ( see fig .",
    "22 of salaris , chieffi & straniero 1993 ) .",
    "this goes exactly in the direction of moving the young ( @xmath3612 gyr ) isochrone towards the observed sequence .",
    "however , salaris , chieffi & straniero ( 1993 ) quantified the effect of o ( the most abundant element among the cno group and ne ) overabundance over the to luminosity : an o overabundance by a factor of 4 would increase the to level by @xmath37 mag .",
    "an unlikely o overabundance of @xmath36 20 would be necessary to move the 12 gyr isochrone to the level of the observed to .",
    "note that spectroscopic [ o / fe ] measurements of a few rgb - a stars ( see fig .  5 in origlia et al .",
    "2003 ) indicate only marginal ( if any ) o overabundance .    in summary",
    ", it seems impossible to reconcile the to level of a young ( @xmath38 gyr ) metal rich isochrone with the observed feature .",
    "accurate measurements of c , n , ne and o abundances for a significant number of sgb - a stars are urgently needed to check for possible anomalies , which could play some role in characterizing the morphology and the position of the sgb - a . moreover , additional modeling with a detailed fine - tuning among [ m / h ] , cno and ne abundances could indeed improve the agreement between old ( 14 - 16 gyr ) isochrones and the observed sgb - a morphology .    a number of papers ( lee et al . 1999 , hughes & wallerstein 2000 , hilker & richtler 2000 , rey et al .",
    "2003 ) argue , from indirect evidences , that the age of the most metal rich stellar population in @xmath0cen is significantly ( @xmath39 gyr ) younger that the most metal poor one . under the hypothesis that the sgb - a is related to the rgb - a , we demonstrated from the direct detection of the to , that this anomalous , metal rich population can not be younger than the most metal poor one .",
    "this evidence excludes the possibility that such a metal rich population be the latest product of the self - enrichment process in @xmath0 cen ( as suggested by rey et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) , while it would support its extra - cluster origin ( see ferraro , bellazzini , pancino 2002 ) .    in the scenario proposed by bekki & freeman ( 2003 )",
    ", @xmath0  cen is the complex stellar relic of a nucleated dwarf galaxy that merged in a remote epoch with the galaxy ( see also dinescu et al . 1999 ; majewski et al .",
    "populations with different metallicities would be the result of subsequent radial gas inflows into the main body of the parent dwarf galaxy .",
    "this scenario can reasonably account for the genuine @xmath0  cen sub - populations at [ fe / h]@xmath40 .",
    "conversely , the anomalous , metal rich population could be a small stellar system ( a globular cluster ?",
    ") accreted by the main body of @xmath0  cen during the disrupting interaction with the galaxy .",
    "the assumption that @xmath0  cen could host a satellite globular cluster is not fully _ ad hoc _ , since both the other two known disrupting systems in the galaxy ( the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal ",
    "ibata et al .",
    "1994 and the canis major dwarf galaxy ",
    "ibata et al .",
    "2003 ) have their own globular cluster system .    a number of alternative hypothesis about the nature of the sgb - a become possible if this population is not related to the rgb - a .",
    "the sgb - a observed morphology could be indeed reproduced by old , low - metallicity isochrones , but this would require the use of a different distance and reddening with respect to main cluster population . such an hypothesis would imply that the anomalous sgb trace a metal - poor stellar system , in the background of the main body of @xmath0  cen .",
    "presently we have no possibility to discriminate between the various scenarios . only direct measurements of radial velocities and metal abundances of a significant sample of sgb - a stars will allow us to answer the enigma posed by the discovery of this new feature .",

    "we also thank the referee , russell cannon , for his comments and suggestions .",
