    "the formation of clusters is a general problem in many - body physics which occurs in various systems . in particular , it is one of the most important features in light nuclei  @xcite together with the formation of the usual nucleon mean field .",
    "a very novel cluster state in light nuclei is the @xmath3-condensate - like state which has attracted increasing interest in recent years  @xcite .",
    "this state can be considered as a gas - like state of clusters in which the center - of - mass motion of each @xmath3 cluster in nuclei occupies the same @xmath5 orbit .",
    "the thsr ( tohsaki - horiuchi - schuck - rpke ) wave function  @xcite proposed for treating the @xmath3-condensate - like state has been proved to be very suitable for the realistic description of the dilute gas - like state of clusters . actually in the case of the hoyle state ( the second @xmath6 state ) of @xmath7c , it was found that the full microscopic solutions  @xcite of the 3@xmath3 rgm ( resonating group method )  @xcite and that  @xcite of the gcm ( generator coordinate method ) with the brink wave function  @xcite are almost 100@xmath2 equivalent to single 3@xmath3 thsr wave functions  @xcite .",
    "also in the case of the ground - state band of @xmath8be , the full microscopic solutions of the 2@xmath3 rgm or its equivalent gcm with the brink wave function were found to be practically 100@xmath2 equivalent to single 2@xmath3 thsr wave functions  @xcite .",
    "although the thsr wave function was devised for describing the gas - like state of clusters , it was already found a decade ago in ref .",
    "@xcite that the wave functions of the ground state of @xmath7c with normal density obtained by 3@xmath3 rgm and 3@xmath3 brink - gcm calculations have a large value of about 0.93 for the squared overlap with _ single _ 3@xmath3 thsr wave functions .",
    "recently the present authors found  @xcite that the @xmath9o + @xmath3 brink - gcm wave functions of the states of the ground - state rotational band of @xmath10ne with normal density are almost 100@xmath2 equivalent to single @xmath9o + @xmath3 thsr wave functions .",
    "these results show that the thsr wave function has an ability which was not expected at first , namely it can be used to study not only the gas - like cluster states with low density but also ( cluster ) states with normal density .    in @xmath10ne , the ground - state rotational band with @xmath11",
    "is known to constitute an inversion doublet together with the negative - parity rotational band with @xmath12 built upon the @xmath13 state at the excitation energy @xmath14 = 5.79 mev .",
    "the existence of the inversion doublet bands has been regarded as being a clear manifestation of the existence of the parity - violating intrinsic state due to the @xmath9o + @xmath3 localized clustering . in general , in non - identical two - cluster systems , the existence of inversion - doublet bands has been regarded as a clear indication of the existence of the localized cluster structure together with the observation of the large cluster decay widths .",
    "this argument implies that we have to regard the states of the ground - state rotational band of @xmath10ne as having a @xmath9o + @xmath3 localized clustering . however , the thsr wave function is the wave function of nonlocalized clusters as is shown by the fact that it was devised for describing cluster - gas - like states .",
    "this puzzle of localized or nonlocalized clustering which is found in the ground - state band states of @xmath10ne is the same as that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the ground - state band states of @xmath8be which has been regarded long since as having the localized @xmath3 + @xmath3 structure are very well described by single 2@xmath3 thsr wave functions which are the wave functions of nonlocalized clusters .    in order to investigate in detail the above - mentioned puzzle in the ground - state band of @xmath10ne ,",
    "the negative - parity rotational band built upon the @xmath13 state at @xmath14 = 5.79 mev which is the inversion - doublet partner of the ground - state band was studied by using the thsr wave functions in ref .",
    "it was found that , also in this negative - parity rotational band , the @xmath9o + @xmath3 brink - gcm wave functions are almost 100@xmath2 equivalent to single @xmath9o + @xmath3 thsr wave functions .",
    "thus both rotational bands constituting the inversion doublet are found to have nonlocalized cluster structure of @xmath9o and @xmath3 .",
    "this is an astonishing finding because , as we mentioned above , the existence of the inversion - doublet bands has been regarded as a clear manifestation of the existence of the localized clustering .",
    "we have to answer the question , `` is it possible to explain the existence of inversion - doublet bands from the nonlocalized cluster dynamics ? ''",
    "the purpose of this paper is to answer the question how the nonlocalized cluster dynamics described by the thsr wave function can be compatible with the concept of a localized cluster structure which has explained the existence of rotational spectra and inversion - doublet bands .",
    "our purpose is then to propose a new understanding of nuclear cluster dynamics .",
    "we will discuss that the cluster dynamics is of nonlocalized nature but the inter - cluster pauli repulsion gives rise to the molecular structure of clusters , which in @xmath10ne is the @xmath9o + @xmath3 molecular structure that generates the inversion - doublet rotational bands . in order to achieve this goal",
    ", we have to solve some problems which we have encountered in the two papers on @xmath10ne , refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and also in the previous papers on structure studies with the use of thsr wave functions .",
    "for example in refs .",
    "@xcite it is reported that the thsr wave functions of the ground - state band at the minimum - energy points are of prolate shape while those of the negative - parity band are oblate . as is mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , the oblate thsr wave functions of the negative - parity band are almost 100@xmath2 equivalent to respective prolate thsr wave functions .",
    "this fact is necessary in order to maintain the idea that both positive - parity and negative - parity bands are generated from the same intrinsic state .",
    "the fact , that after the angular - momentum projection a prolate thsr wave function is almost equivalent to a certain oblate thsr wave function and vice versa , was found and discussed already in the study of @xmath8be  @xcite and also in the study of @xmath7c  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will clarify the reason and the physical meaning of this fact which is general in the case of two - cluster systems .",
    "we will explain that in two - cluster systems there exists no physically oblate deformation by showing that after angular - momentum projection even oblate thsr wave functions gives negative quadrupole moments implying that the intrinsic quadrupole moment is of positive sign and hence the intrinsic deformation is prolate .",
    "we will also show that any oblate thsr wave function is equivalent almost 100@xmath2 to a rotation average of a prolate thsr wave function around the axis perpendicular to the symmetry axis of prolate deformation .",
    "we will calculate the density distribution of prolate thsr wave functions in order to demonstrate undoubtedly that the inter - cluster pauli repulsion gives rise to molecular structures .",
    "we will see that the thsr wave function which expresses nonlocalized clusters corresponds to the density distribution of the molecular configuration of clusters .",
    "our new understanding of nuclear cluster dynamics can be stated in saying that nuclear dynamics are basically of nonlocalized nature but the pauli repulsion makes the two - cluster system look like having effectively localized clustering .",
    "based on the fact that all the cluster states we have ever studied by using thsr wave functions are well described by single thsr wave functions , we know that the clusters make independent motion occupying the lowest orbit of the harmonic - oscillator - like mean - field potential characterized by the size parameter @xmath15 with a magnitude similar to the nuclear radius .",
    "we already know that the excitation mode of the system is well described by the hill - wheeler equation with the parameter @xmath15 treated as the hill - wheeler coordinate in the systems of 3@xmath3 s  @xcite and 4@xmath3 s  @xcite .",
    "therefore we see that the excitation of the system is described firstly by the dynamics of the size parameter @xmath15 which is adopted as the generator coordinate and secondly by the excitation of the single - particle motion of clusters in their own mean field potential",
    ". we will call our new understanding of nuclear cluster dynamics the container picture of nuclear clustering , by which we aim to stress that the central quantity of cluster dynamics is the size parameter @xmath15 of the cluster mean - field potential which we call the container .",
    "it is clear that in this picture the existence of cluster - gas states is natural and the formation mechanism of cluster - gas states is just due to the wide extension of the container .    in order to further facilitate the understanding of the picture we want to promote",
    ", it may be helpful for the reader to view the cluster motion in the container as free as long as the clusters do not overlap with one another .",
    "this picture which is similar to the concept of excluded volume applies mostly to states of low density ( @xmath16be and hoyle state in @xmath17c ) .",
    "however , as we will see in this paper , also strongly deformed states can easily show cluster structures of this type .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that this  container picture \" is at its limit for two cluster systems which are strongly prolate , i.e. of molecular structure , but becomes more and more adequate for low density states with more than two clusters when the container is either spherical or not so strongly deformed .",

    "our finding that the prolate and oblate thsr wave functions can become almost equivalent after the angular - momentum projection makes us doubt about the above argument , because after the angular - momentum projection of @xmath174 the prolate - deformation character of @xmath174 may not be maintained . in order",
    "to get rid of this doubt , it is desirable to judge the deformation by using not the intrinsic wave function but the angular - momentum projected wave function .",

    "we can say that dynamics prefers nonlocalized clustering but kinematics makes the system look like localized clustering . of course",
    ", this localization is most pronounced in the necessarily strongly prolate two cluster systems . in systems with low density @xmath3 clusters in number more than two have more space to move independently and are , therefore , less localized in spherical containers .",

[ fig:5 ] .",
    "it is to be noted that because of the almost zero values of @xmath113 , three @xmath3 clusters are not allowed to expand into the @xmath187 and @xmath264 directions , which means that three @xmath3 clusters are only allowed to make one - dimensional motion along the @xmath188 direction .",
    "therefore the inter - cluster pauli principle acts only along the @xmath188 direction , which is the reason of the spatial localization of the three @xmath3 clusters . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is reported that the @xmath3 linear - chain brink - gcm wave function is almost 100@xmath2 equivalent to a single 3@xmath3 thsr wave function with strong prolate deformation which is just the @xmath3 thsr wave function in fig .",

    "please also notice that for small values of @xmath76 the energies in fig .",

    "also it should be noted that fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] corresponds to the ground state of @xmath1  and , thus , has a much higher average density than the one of @xmath16be .",
    "therefore , the cluster structure is more compact .    in",
    "the above we discussed that , in two - cluster systems , cluster states generally have effective localization of clusters because of the inter - cluster pauli repulsion .",
    "however , in three or more cluster systems , the spatial arrangement of clusters are not necessarily geometrical , namely clusters can be nonlocalized , although the inter - cluster separations are non - zero simultaneously because of the inter - cluster pauli repulsion .",
    "however , as is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , if a cluster state is forced to have strongly - prolate deformation , the state can have effective localization of clusters like in the case of 3@xmath3 linear - chain structure of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "when the inter - cluster separations are large , the spatial arrangement of clusters can be non - rigid and gas - like .",
    "more on the spatial behaviour of three ( or more ) @xmath3 particle systems will be investigated in the future .    as is seen in the above discussions , the container picture of cluster dynamics has three important ingredients .",
    "the first is to regard the motion of clusters as being mutually independent and described by the nonlocalized lowest orbit of the self - consistent mean - field potential of clusters .",
    "the second is the collective excitation of the system which is described by the hill - wheeler equation with respect to the size parameter(s ) @xmath15 of the mean - field potential .",
    "the third is the inter - cluster pauli repulsion which , in the case of two - cluster systems , is the origin of the molecular structure of clusters and which , in cases of more @xmath3 clusters , like in the hoyle state of @xmath262 , leads to @xmath265 scattering processes which somewhat depopulate the @xmath3 condensate .",
    "in this paper we first discussed the hybrid - brink - thsr wave function introduced in ref .",
    "the energy curve with this new - type of wave function revealed that the traditional understanding is incorrect , namely that the localized - cluster picture is strongly supported by the energy curve with the brink wave function which gives the minimum point at a non - zero value of the inter - cluster distance parameter .",

    "namely if we allow the size parameter of relative wave function of the brink wave function to take an arbitrary value , the minimum point of the energy curve is no more at non - zero inter - cluster distance parameter but at zero inter - cluster distance parameter .",
    "the energy - minimum point at the limit of the thsr wave function is very different from that at the limit of the brink wave function in their characters , because the thsr wave function at the energy - minimum point is almost 100@xmath2 equivalent to the full solution of rgm while the brink wave function at the energy - minimum point is only the main component of the full solution of rgm . in two - cluster systems ,",
    "the almost 100@xmath2 equivalence of the full solution of the rgm to a single thsr wave function has been confirmed in the ground - state band states of @xmath8be and in the inversion - doublet band states of @xmath10ne . in the case of three - cluster systems , we know that about 93@xmath2 equivalence of the full solution of the @xmath252 rgm to a single thsr wave function has been found in the _ ground state _ of @xmath7c while almost 100@xmath2 equivalence of the full solution of the @xmath252 rgm to a single thsr wave function has been found in the _ hoyle state _ of @xmath7c .",
    "it will be important to check whether this kind of high - percentage equivalence of the full solution of the rgm to a single thsr wave function is true or not in general three - cluster and also more - than - three - cluster systems .",
    "the thsr wave function which was originally devised for the description of cluster - gas states has proved to be able also to describe well non - gas cluster states including ground states with more or less pronounced cluster structure .",
    "the ground state of @xmath7c and the ground - state band states of @xmath10ne are largely of shell - model character .",
    "the good reproduction of these states by thsr wave functions means that the thsr wave function can also well express shell model characters .",
    "this point is assured by the property of the thsr wave function that in the limit of @xmath272 the thsr wave function is equal to some important shell - model wave function . in the appendix b",
    ", we discuss two examples concerning the @xmath4  + @xmath3 system and the 3@xmath3 system in the ground state of @xmath262 .",
    "we also elaborated on the container picture of the cluster dynamics .",
    "it is firstly described by the hill - wheeler equation of the size parameter @xmath15 of the thsr wave function which , in the case of the spherical thsr wave function , is written as @xmath273 here the integration over @xmath15 in the hill - wheeler equation is expressed by the summation over the discrete values of @xmath15 . in the case of two - cluster systems where the thsr wave function @xmath274 is written as @xmath275 this hill - wheeler equation is equivalent to the rgm equation .",
    "it is because this hill - wheeler equation can be rewitten as @xmath276 from this equivalence we can conclude that we can solve the scattering problem with the hill - wheeler equation of the thsr wave function . in the cases of the ground - state band of @xmath16be and the inversion - doublet band states of @xmath1 ,",
    "the obtained thsr - gcm wave functions were found to be almost 100@xmath2 equivalent to _ single _ thsr wave functions . on the other hand",
    "it was pointed out that , since the thsr - gcm wave functions are equal to the brink - gcm ones , the latter are also equivalent to single thsr wave functions .",
    "this fact naturally implies that the structure of the thsr wave function captures very well the clustering dynamics .",
    "the thsr wave function can describe in a unified and natural manner three kinds of states , the ground state , the ordinary cluster state , and the alpha - condensate state .",
    "the brink - gcm wave function , that is the superposition of localized brink wave function , sometimes demands large efforts to describe some excited states of cluster nature as , e.g. , the hoyle state of @xmath262 .",
    "the hill - wheeler equation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hillwheeler ] ) was solved for the systems of 3@xmath3 s  @xcite and 4@xmath3 s  @xcite . in the @xmath252 system",
    "the thsr wave functions were shown to successfully reproduce the ground state and the hoyle state with a @xmath252 condensate - like structure , that is with a large value of @xmath15-parameter underlying the container picture .",
    "it is to be recalled that even in the @xmath252 case the thsr - gcm wave function of the ground state has 93@xmath2 squared overlap with a single thsr wave function and that the thsr - gcm wave function of the hoyle state has 99@xmath2 squared overlap with a single thsr wave function  @xcite .",
    "in fact , these squared overlaps are expected to grow to nearly 100@xmath2 if @xmath277 correlations are included to the container picture .",
    "it also is to be noted that even in the case of @xmath252 s the thsr - gcm wave functions are almost 100@xmath2 equivalent to brink - gcm ones .",
    "we also succeeded to calculate the @xmath278 states and to reproduce the ground - state band @xmath103 state and the @xmath252 gas - like @xmath279 state . in the @xmath280 system we succeeded to reproduce , for the spin @xmath230 , the ground state and the @xmath281 state which is the hoyle - analogue state with a @xmath280 condensate - like structure",
    "however , unlike for the @xmath252 system , in the @xmath280 system , the cluster states lying between the ground state and the @xmath3 condensate - like @xmath281 state could not be fully reproduced with the hill - wheeler equation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hillwheeler ] ) .",
    "namely instead of the observed four cluster states between the ground state and the @xmath281 state ( which were nicely reproduced by the @xmath280 ocm of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the hill - wheeler equation of eq .  ( [ eq : hillwheeler ] ) could give us only two states .",
    "the reason of this insufficiency is because of the variety of the observed cluster states in @xmath9o for which the use of only one collective coordinate @xmath15 is too simple and unsatisfactory .",
    "the result of the @xmath280 ocm calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite tells us that the dominant structures of @xmath282 , @xmath283 , @xmath284 , and @xmath285 states are @xmath7c@xmath286 + @xmath3 ( @xmath287 wave ) , @xmath7c@xmath288 + @xmath3 ( @xmath289 wave ) , @xmath7c@xmath286 + @xmath3 ( @xmath287 wave with higher nodal number ) , and @xmath7c@xmath290 + @xmath3 ( @xmath291 wave ) , respectively .",
    "one possible way to cope with this variety of cluster structures is to use two kinds of size parameters @xmath292 and @xmath293 by extending the thsr wave function ; @xmath294 where @xmath295 is the thsr wave function of three @xmath3 clusters , @xmath296 , with the deformed size parameter @xmath292 with @xmath252 center - of - mass coordinate removed .",
    "this extended thsr wave function is similar to the rgm - type wave function of two clusters , @xmath295 and @xmath297 , with the relative wave function @xmath298 with @xmath299 .",
    "therefore the superposition of this wave function over @xmath300 allows us to describe scattering states in various channels of @xmath7c + @xmath3 .",
    "this will also be a very interesting study for the near future .",
    "the original thsr wave function describes only positive - parity states .",
    "therefore in ref .",
    "@xcite where the negative - parity partner band of the inversion doublet bands had to be studied , a prescription was proposed for constructing negative - parity wave functions as a natural extension of the original thsr wave function .",
    "this prescription is for two - cluster wave functions . in ref .",
    "@xcite and also in this paper we call the negative - parity wave functions constructed by this prescription simply thsr wave functions . as a starting point , we used a hybrid - brink - thsr wave function with a non - zero inter - cluster separation parameter @xmath76 .",
    "from this wave function we project out the negative - parity wave function and then normalize it .",
    "after normalization we can take safely the limit of @xmath301 0 , and this limit wave function is just the negative - parity thsr wave function .",
    "this prescription to construct the negative - parity thsr wave function in two - cluster systems can be generalized to the systems with three and more clusters .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath280 system , we extend the @xmath252 - @xmath3 thsr wave function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : c12-alpha ] ) into the hybrid - brink - thsr - type wave function , @xmath302 from this wave function we project out the negative - parity wave function and then normalize it .",
    "after normalization we can take safely the limit of @xmath303 0 , and this limit wave function is just the negative - parity thsr wave function which we intend to construct .",
    "the container picture of cluster dynamics has three important ingredients .",
    "the first is the mutually independent nonlocalized motion of clusters occupying the lowest orbit of the self - consistent mean - field potential of clusters .",
    "the second is the collective motion with respect to the size parameter(s ) @xmath15 of the mean - field potential which is described by the hill - wheeler equation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hillwheeler ] ) .",
    "the third is the inter - cluster pauli repulsion due to the fermi statistics of the nucleons which constitute the clusters . in two - cluster systems ,",
    "this pauli repulsion makes the two clusters locate at some distance from each other , which gives rise , effectively , to localized clustering in two - cluster systems , in spirit similar to the phenomenological excluded volume prescription .",
    "this is the reason why the cluster states in two - cluster systems are always molecular states with spatial localization of clusters .",
    "however , in the systems of three or more clusters ,",
    "although the inter - cluster separations in all pairs of clusters are non - zero simultaneously , it does not necessarily mean in general the formation of some localized arrangement of clusters . in spite of this general situation , we know that there have been reports of localized cluster structure in systems of three or more clusters .",

    "@xcite and also by the fmd calculation of ref .",

    "<S> a container picture is proposed for understanding cluster dynamics where the clusters make nonlocalized motion occupying the lowest orbit of the cluster mean - field potential characterized by the size parameter @xmath0 in the thsr ( tohsaki - horiuchi - schuck - rpke ) wave function . </S>",
