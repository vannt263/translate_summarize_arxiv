    "<S> this representation nicely shows the evolution of in - gap spectral weight upon doping , with none of the spectra displaying any metallic fermi edge . the observation that even the @xmath1 phase , for which superconductivity has been claimed , remains gapped is most surprising , but in agreement with two previous reports  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as one possible explanation polaronic effects have been suggested  @xcite , which may cause a pseudogap at the fermi level as has been observed , e.g. , in oxides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a pseudogap typically exhibits an exponential decay towards the fermi energy @xcite , which is not consistent with the present observation . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the gap may originate from strong electronic correlations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in a hubbard model - type description the intramolecular coulomb energy @xmath22 in organic solids is often comparable or even larger than the bandwidth from intermolecular hopping @xcite , which can drive partially filled bands into a mott insulating state .    in order to further explore the latter scenario , </S>",

    "<S> the origin of the mott gap for k@xmath0picene with @xmath7 lies not only in the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath22 and the hund s coupling @xmath25 but also in the interorbital hybridization @xmath26 .    </S>",

    "<S> this leaves two open questions : ( 1 ) what is the electronic groundstate for _ non - integer _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 , and ( 2 ) how can the insulating behavior of the @xmath1 phase be reconciled with the observation of a meissner - ochsenfeld effect ?    concerning the first question we note that in a mott - insulator deviation from integer band - filling is normally expected to lead to a metallic phase with electron- or hole - type carriers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that the doping concentration determined in our photoemission experiments is a macroscopic quantity , averaged over the extension of the photon spot ( @xmath34 mm ) , and may be composed of phase - separated integer - filled domains . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a recent raman study @xcite has observed that k@xmath0picene decomposes into @xmath13 , 2 and 3 phases , while a defined @xmath3 signal could not be detected , indicating that this phase is not stable . </S>",
    "<S> one can thus understand the photoemission spectra as a superposition of different integer @xmath20 phases . </S>",
    "<S> because the shape and gapped behavior of the corresponding theoretical spectra is very similar , the main doping effect will consist in the appearance and increasing spectral weight of the lumo and lumo+1 derived lower hubbard band , as indeed reflected by the behavior of feature f@xmath14 in our experimental spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> the second question is more puzzling . </S>",
    "<S> our present results are in line with the general observation that alkali metal - doped organic semiconductors are mostly insulating @xcite , with k - doped fullerene ( k@xmath16c@xmath35 ) being one of the rare exceptions @xcite . on the other hand , in the original paper by mitsuhashi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",

    "<S> reconciling our room - temperature results with these observations would require an insulator - to - metal transition somewhere between 300 and 25 k ( the highest measured temperature in ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mott - hubbard scenario derived from our dft+dmft calculations does not provide any mechanism for such a transition but would rather stabilize the gap towards low temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> another important aspect is that so far all superconducting signatures have been obtained from intercalated compact picene powder @xcite , in contrast to the _ in vacuo _ grown thin films used here . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that both sets of samples differ in subtle structural details accounting for the conflicting findings . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the dft+dmft calculations are based on a dft - relaxed _ bulk _ structure which one would expect to be relevant for the polycrystalline powder , at least for the interior of the powder grains . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus tempting to speculate about the possibility of the superconducting phase actually being located at the grain boundaries , which may have structural and/or electronic properties different from the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> certainly more clarifying work needs to be done in this direction .    in summary , our combined photoemission and dft+dmft study finds that k@xmath0picene is a correlated mott insulator for any integer doping concentration @xmath3 , 2 and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the insulating behavior of samples with macroscopic non - integer filling observed in the experiment is attributed to microscopic phase separation in line with recent raman results . </S>",
