    "a molecular wire is a single molecule ( or a few molecules ) that forms an electrically conducting bridge between a pair of metallic nano - contacts . in recent years molecular wires",
    "have been realized in the laboratory and their electronic transport properties have been measured@xcite .",
    "there have also been many theoretical advances in modeling such systems and the study of transport in molecular wires continues to be an active area of experimental and theoretical research@xcite .",
    "it has been found that the current flowing through a molecular wire depends strongly on the electronic structure of the molecule as well as the geometry of the molecule and contacts and the chemical bonding between them . in a simplified picture , when a potential bias is applied to the contacts , the electrochemical potentials of the contacts separate and molecular orbitals located in the window of energy between the two electrochemical potentials mediate electron flow from one contact to the other .",
    "the current rises sharply each time this window of energy expands to include an additional molecular orbital .",
    "much work has been done modeling and attempting to understand i - v characteristics that have been obtained experimentally @xcite .",
    "no theoretical studies have been reported , however , of another potentially important property of self - assembled molecular wires , namely , photon emission ( electroluminescence ) from a molecular wire carrying an electric current due to electronic transitions between molecular orbitals . when a bias voltage is applied to the contacts ,",
    "the molecular wire moves out of equilibrium , with a flux of electrons passing through it .",
    "electrons enter the molecule from the contact with the higher electrochemical potential , and drain into the other contact .",
    "since the electrochemical potentials of the contacts are no longer the same , one can no longer assume that the orbitals of the molecule will be filled up to an energy equal to a common fermi energy of the contacts .",
    "the passage of electrons through the molecule may lead to partial occupation of various different molecular orbitals that lie within the electrochemical potential window of the contacts .",
    "it is possible that transitions from one partially occupied molecular orbital to another of lower energy occur , resulting in photon emission .",
    "although definitive experimental evidence of this effect has not yet been reported , related phenomena have been observed in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments : systems with an stm tip over a clean metallic surface are known to emit photons due to the decay of plasmons@xcite .",
    "recent stm experiments on molecular monolayers adsorbed on metal substrates have suggested that a different , molecule - dependent photon emission process may also occur : poirier has reported molecule - dependent photon emission in an stm experiment involving reduced and oxidized alkanethiol monolayers adsorbed on au(111)@xcite . in an stm experiment involving monolayer films of c@xmath0 fullerenes on au(110 ) surfaces ,",
    "berndt _ et al .",
    "_ observed enhanced photon emission when the stm tip was placed above an individual molecule@xcite .",
    "smolyaninov has reported photon emission at energies similar to copper phthalocyanine ( cupc ) transition energies in stm experiments involving cupc adsorbed on au@xcite . however , in very recent stm experiments by hoffmann _",
    "et al . _ on hexa - tert - butyl - decacyclene on noble - metal surfaces@xcite",
    ", it was found that while the presence of the molecules modulated the photon emission , the observed emission appeared to be plasmon - mediated rather than molecular in character .",
    "thus , the nature of photon emission mechanisms for stm - molecular monolayer systems is yet to be adequately understood .    in all of these stm experiments",
    ", a bias voltage was applied between the stm tip and metallic surface , with a molecular monolayer interposed between these two contacts as in molecular wire systems .",
    "however , there are important differences between these stm molecular monolayer systems and self - assembled molecular wires : the coupling between the stm tip and the molecule is usually very small compared to the coupling between the molecule and the substrate , whereas for self - assembled molecular wires that are bonded chemically to both metal contacts , the couplings of the molecule to the source and drain may be comparable in strength .",
    "also , the stm experiments involve planar metallic substrates , which are quite different from the nanoscopic metallic contacts of some self - assembled molecular wires .",
    "it is unclear how these differences would affect photon emission , so it is of interest to consider photon emission not only from stm - molecular monolayer systems but also from more symmetrically coupled self - assembled molecular wires .",
    "electroluminescence from molecular wires is a potentially important effect , not only because of its intrinsic fundamental interest , but also as a novel experimental probe of molecular nano - electronic devices .",
    "for example , as we will show below , by observing the photon emission spectrum of a molecular wire , important information about its the electronic structure , including the energies of the molecular orbitals , their locations relative to the fermi level , and their occupations as a function of bias voltage , may in principle be obtained .",
    "there is currently disagreement between different theoretical models of 1,4 benzene - dithiolate ( bdt ) attached to gold contacts@xcite regarding the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) , relative to the fermi level of the contacts .",
    "if the photon emission spectra of such systems were modelled , and compared with experiment , important new insights into the most appropriate models for molecular wires could be obtained .    in this article , we present and solve a generic model for photon emission from a molecular wire . as",
    "this is the first theoretical study of this effect , our purpose will be to develop a basic qualitative picture of the underlying mechanism , and to examine how adjustment of the various model parameters , to reflect different experimental situations , should affect photon emission .",
    "we use a one - dimensional tight - binding model that attempts to capture the important physics involved in a way that is simple and intuitively reasonable , and is qualitatively consistent with what is already known about molecular wire electronic structure and transport .",
    "another objective of this work is to provide some guidance to experimentalists as to which types of systems to study in order to observe photon emission .",
    "we find that , under certain circumstances , the model predicts that photon emission should occur , due to molecular orbital transitions .",
    "we show how molecular orbital occupations behave as a function of applied bias voltage , and how varying the model parameters changes this behaviour .",
    "fermi s golden rule is used to calculate photon emission spectra .",
    "we show how the emission depends on molecular orbital occupations , and the locations of the molecular orbitals relative to the fermi levels of the contacts .",
    "our model and theoretical approach are described in section ii .",
    "the results of our calculations and their interpretation are presented in section iii .",
    "we conclude in section iv by summarizing our results , and discussing their implications for possible experiments directed at observing photon emission from bdt attached to gold contacts .",
    "each metal contact will be modelled as a one - dimensional tight - binding chain .",
    "the molecular wire is modelled as a pair of atoms placed next to the origin , forming a bridge between the two contacts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the model hamiltonian of this system is @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the site energies of the left ( source ) and right ( drain ) contacts , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the site energies of atoms @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the molecule , which depend on the bias voltage applied to the wire and the nature of the metal contacts , as well as the identities of atoms @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "we consider the orbitals of different atoms to be orthogonal .",

    "we take the the electrochemical potentials of the source and drain contacts to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the bias voltage applied between them and @xmath18 is their common fermi level at zero applied bias .",

    "this equation holds for both @xmath27 and @xmath28 , so when an electron with initial wavevector @xmath29 undergoes transmission , its wavevector changes ( to @xmath30 ) due to the difference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for certain @xmath29 , there are no real solutions for @xmath31 . in these cases",

    "the @xmath17 dependence arises from the effect of @xmath17 on the site energies of the contacts ( described above ) and of the molecule that will be discussed below . using landauer theory@xcite , an expression for the current",
    "is obtained : @xmath45 here we assume the temperature to be 0 k , so the fermi functions are trivial , and the transmission probability is only integrated through the fermi energy window .    to calculate emission spectra for the molecular wire we use the expression for the spontaneous emission rate of a system emitting photons into empty space , using fermi s golden rule@xcite .",
    "the emission rate is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 represent initial and final states , and @xmath49 is their difference in energy .",
    "we consider emission only from the molecular sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the emission rate is therefore approximated by @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 label initial and final states .",
    "the overlap terms @xmath53 and @xmath54 are neglected since they should be small compared to @xmath55 and @xmath56 . we approximate @xmath55 and @xmath56 by the locations of their atomic centers , so that @xmath57 , @xmath58 ( @xmath7 being the molecular bond length )",
    ". thus , we have @xmath59 to calculate the emission rate as a function of photon energy , we must consider all electron states of the system , incoming from both the source and drain contacts .",
    "since we assume the temperature to be 0 k , all states up to the electrochemical potential of the appropriate contact are occupied .",
    "@xmath48 must be initially unoccupied , and it must be of lower energy than @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , we consider transitions from occupied initial states that are incoming from the source , to final states , within the electrochemical potential window , that are incoming from the drain . after normalizing the wavefunctions and converting the sum over k - states ( and spin ) into an integral over energy , an expression for the photon emission spectrum ( for a given bias voltage )",
    "is obtained : @xmath60    in order to interpret our results physically , it is useful to relate the emission spectra to total occupations of the molecular orbitals , as a function of bias voltage . for this purpose , we project eigenstates of the system given by equation  ( [ psi ] ) onto the bonding and antibonding orbitals of the isolated molecule , whose coefficients will be labelled @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "their total occupations are calculated by summing over all occupied electron states ( including spin ) incoming from both contacts .",
    "this sum is converted into an integral , and an expression for the total bonding and antibonding orbital occupations ( @xmath63 ) is obtained : @xmath64 changes in the occupations of the bonding and antibonding orbitals in response to changes of the applied bias voltage may result in some charging of the molecule .",
    "if this occurs , the charging causes an electrostatic shift of the molecular energy levels that in turn severely limits the actual charging that takes place@xcite . in the present work we approximate the shift of the molecular levels in response to the applied bias by adjusting @xmath4 and @xmath5 equally so as to maintain the net charge that the molecule has at zero bias .",
    "the simplicity of this approximation is in keeping with the generic nature of the molecular wire model that we consider here .",
    "it yields behavior of the molecular levels with bias that is physically reasonable , and as will be seen in section iii b , remarkably similar to that obtained from _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for some molecular wire systems .    in the remainder of this article",
    "we will consider the case where the fermi level of the leads at zero bias falls within the homo - lumo gap of the molecule , as is typical of molecular wires such as the au / benzene - dithiolate / au system .",
    "thus we will identify the bonding and antibonding orbitals @xmath65 and @xmath66 with the homo and lumo , respectively , of the isolated molecule .",
    "( the terms @xmath65 and homo will henceforth be used interchangeably as will @xmath66 and lumo . )",
    "our model parameters will be chosen so that at zero bias the fermi level of the leads lies between @xmath65 and @xmath66 . as will be seen below , if the fermi level is well above @xmath65 and well below @xmath66 ( but @xmath65 and @xmath66 are within the electronic energy band of the leads ) it follows from eq .",
    "12 that at zero bias @xmath65 is almost completely filled with electrons and @xmath66 is almost empty , although @xmath65 is never _ totally _ full and @xmath66 is never completely empty because of the level broadening that occurs due to hybridization between the states of the molecule and leads . in this way",
    "the homo and lumo character of the @xmath65 and @xmath66 orbitals is expressed within our model when the molecule couples to the leads . by choosing different values of the site energies @xmath4 and @xmath5 at zero bias , the energies and occupations of the @xmath65 and @xmath66 orbitals can be varied .",
    "thus the effects of differing amounts of charge transfer between the molecule and leads can also be studied within our model .",
    "we also note in passing that although our results are described here in terms of electron transport and optical transitions between occupied and empty electron states , an equivalent description can be given in terms of electron and hole transport and optical transitions .",
    "we consider the case where the energy bands of the contacts are partially filled ( @xmath67 ) . in numerical results presented below the hopping parameters are chosen to have values typical of molecular wire systems ( @xmath68 ev , @xmath69 ev ) , resulting in a homo lumo gap of 3 ev for the isolated molecule .      in this section ,",
    "the homo - lumo gap of the molecule is chosen to be centred at the zero bias fermi level of the contacts , and the molecule - contact couplings have equal values .",
    "first , we consider the case where these couplings have values similar to those in chemically bonded molecular wire systems ( @xmath70 ev ) .",

[",
    "notice that the filling and emptying of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , as a function of @xmath17 , is gradual .",

    "this is one of the factors that contributes to the noticeable shift of the emission peak upwards in energy with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "another factor contributing to this blue shift is the cubic dependence of the emission rate on the photon energy @xmath49 in equation  ( [ molemit ] ) .",

    "[ fig3]c shows the orbital occupations for the case of @xmath65 just below @xmath18 in energy at zero bias ( same situation as fig . [",

    "this is an important consideration to keep in mind when attempting to observe molecular photon emission experimentally .",
    "our results suggest that , for a homo - lumo gap that is symmetric about @xmath18 , asymmetric molecule - contact couplings , such as those where one of the contacts is an stm tip , result in very low photon emission rates .",
    "we consider now strongly asymmetric couplings ( @xmath80 ev , @xmath81 ev ) for the case of homo or lumo very close to @xmath18 at zero bias .",
    "this coupling configuration is analogous to an stm experiment performed under forward bias ( the stm tip acts as the ( weakly coupled ) source , from which electrons flow ) . the opposite configuration ( @xmath84 ev , @xmath88 ev ) is analogous to an stm experiment performed under reverse bias ( the stm tip acts as the ( weakly coupled ) drain ) . fig .",
    "[ fig6]a shows how , for the forward bias situation , @xmath65 and @xmath66 change in energy as a function of bias , for the case of @xmath65 very close to @xmath18 at @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 drop in energy following the electrochemical potential @xmath72 of the strongly coupled contact .",
    "even as @xmath66 crosses @xmath71 , the orbital energies continue to decrease almost linearly because , unlike in fig . [ fig4 ] , @xmath65 is very close to @xmath72 , so that the density of states at @xmath72 is high and the weak filling of @xmath66 that occurs as it crosses @xmath71 can be compensated by a weak emptying of @xmath65 with only a very small deviation of @xmath65 from its linear behavior .",
    "[ fig6]b shows the energies of @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the case of reversed contact coupling strengths ( @xmath84 ev , @xmath88 ev ) , which is equivalent to performing an stm experiment under reverse bias .",
    "this time , @xmath65 and @xmath66 rise in energy following the electrochemical potential @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath66 never approaches @xmath71 , so it remains empty .",
    "[ fig6]c , d show photon emission for the forward bias situation ( fig . [ fig6]a ) .",
    "biases above 3 v result in a small amount of photon emission because , unlike in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , @xmath65 is only partially occupied , so some transitions from @xmath66 may occur . emission is still weak ( 1 - 2 orders of magnitude less than for symmetric contacts ) , because @xmath66 becomes only weakly occupied when crossing the fermi level of the weakly coupled contact @xmath71 . the emission spectrum , shown in fig . [ fig6]d ,",
    "is peaked at an energy slightly less than 3 ev , because the lower energy tail of @xmath65 is completely filled , and may not receive transitions . in the reversed coupling situation ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]b ) , photon emission is negligible , since @xmath66 never approaches @xmath71 and remains empty .",
    "now we consider the cases where @xmath66 is very close to @xmath18 at @xmath89 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]e , f ) .",
    "again , the energies of @xmath65 and @xmath66 follow the fermi level of the strongly coupled contact .",
    "therefore , for the case of weak source contact coupling ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]e ) , there is negligible emission because @xmath65 never crosses @xmath72 and remains completely filled . for the case of weak drain contact coupling ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]f ) , there is ( weak ) photon emission , because @xmath65 enters the electrochemical potential window and ( slightly ) empties .",
    "( the emission curves for this case are very similar to fig .",
    "[ fig6]c , d . ) this property of asymmetrically coupled systems may be used to help distinguish a system where the homo is close to @xmath18 from a system where the lumo is close to @xmath18 , with the use of an stm as the weakly coupled contact . within our model ,",
    "if the homo is close to @xmath18 , the result is photon emission under high forward bias and negligible emission under reverse bias , whereas if the lumo is close to @xmath18 , the result is emission under high reverse bias and negligible emission under forward bias .",
    "the implications of this may be important for molecular electronics research .",
    "for example , there is currently disagreement over whether @xmath18 is located close to the homo or the lumo in the system of bdt attached to gold contacts@xcite .",
    "the photon emission characteristics of such a system could help determine the locations of the homo and lumo , and therefore which type of model is more appropriate for such a system .",
    "we have examined theoretically the possibility of photon emission occuring due to molecular transitions in current - carrying molecular wires .",
    "our results suggest that significant photon emission may occur for bias voltages near or above the homo - lumo energy gap of the molecule , depending on the specifics of the electronic structure of the molecule and contacts and of the couplings between the molecule and the source and drain .",
    "the predicted photon spectra are peaked near the gap energy@xcite .",
    "if two molecular orbitals are located in the energy window between the electrochemical potentials of the contacts , they will both be partially occupied and , as long as transitions between the orbitals are not forbidden , transitions from the higher energy orbital to the lower energy orbital should occur , resulting in photon emission .",
    "we find that varying the strength of the molecule - contact couplings changes the emission strength and spectrum .",
    "weak , symmetric couplings result in a sharply peaked emission spectrum .",
    "asymmetric couplings result in reduced photon emission .",
    "emission from strongly asymmetrically coupled systems ( such as some stm - molecular monolayer systems ) is predicted to be extremely weak if the zero bias value fermi level @xmath18 of the contacts is not close to the homo or lumo energy of the molecule .",
    "if @xmath18 is close to the homo or lumo energy , the amount of photon emission observed under forward bias and under reverse bias , in an stm experiment , may be compared in order to determine which of the orbitals is close in energy to @xmath18 .",
    "whether @xmath18 is close to the homo or lumo energy is a difficult unresolved issue in current research on molecular wires such as bdt attached to gold contacts ; _ ab initio _ calculations based on different models and approximations @xcite have yielded opposite results in this regard .",
    "it is believed that the homo and lumo of bdt attached to gold contacts are composed of bonding and antibonding orbitals ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) .",
    "the present work suggests that , if the contact couplings are symmetric , photon emission will not be drastically different whether @xmath18 is close to the homo or to the lumo : each orbital will become partially occupied as the bias voltage becomes greater than the homo - lumo gap , and , so long as @xmath92 transitions are allowed , this will result in photon emission .",
    "optical transitions are forbidden if @xmath93 .",
    "we have used extended hckel theory to examine the homo and lumo of bdt@xcite .",
    "the contacts were not included in this calculation . by symmetry analysis of the homo and lumo",
    ", we found that @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is in the direction of the plane of the molecule , perpendicular to the contacts .",
    "therefore , optical transitions should be allowed , and would result in the emission of y - polarized photons .",
    "experimental evidence of bdt optical transitions is available in the form of absorption spectra for bdt in hexane@xcite .",
    "absorption occurs for energies higher than about 4 ev , indicating a possible experimental value for bdt s homo - lumo energy gap .",
    "transport measurements on au / bdt / au molecular wires have been reported at bias voltages as high as approximately 5v@xcite .",
    "thus it appears to be quite reasonable to undertake an experimental search for electroluminescence due to molecular transitions in au / bdt / au systems .",
    "an experimental determination of the homo - lumo gap of bdt in the presence of the au contacts by this means would be an important test of the validity of various theories of molecular wires .",
    "if one of the au contacts is an stm tip , electroluminescence measurements may also be expected to be helpful in determining the location of the fermi level of au relative to the homo and lumo states of the molecular wire .",
    "the study of electroluminescence from molecular wires has only just begun .",
    "we hope that the theoretical ideas presented here will stimulate further experimental and theoretical work on this interesting and potentially important topic .",
