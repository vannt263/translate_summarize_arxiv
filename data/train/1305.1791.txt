    "since the synthesis of two - dimensional ( 2d ) graphene@xcite , much research has been focused on it due to its unique properties and tremendous possible applications in nanoscale devices.@xcite graphyne ( gy ) , a 2d carbon allotrope with the same symmetry as graphene predicted to have a high possibility of synthesis@xcite , is made up of hexagonal carbon rings and acetylene linkages .",
    "graphdiyne(gdy ) , belonging to the family of gy has been successfully grown on the surface of copper recently.@xcite consequently , the preparation of gy can be expected because theoretical work has shown that it is energetically more stable than gdy .",
    "previous work has shown that the surface adsorption of tm atom profoundly influences the electronic properties of graphene and induces spin polarization@xcite in the system , which makes it a vital candidate for spintronics@xcite . likewise , in our previous work@xcite",
    ", the adsorption of single 3d tm atom on gy sheet will promote magnetization of the tm - gy system , which indicates that the tm - gy systems are potential candidates for spintronics .",
    "moreover , recent studies based on dft+u approach@xcite , auxiliary - field quantum monte carlo@xcite , and multireference quantum chemical methods@xcite have shown a weak binding for tm adatom on graphene .",
    "it is consistent with the transmission electron microscopy experiments@xcite that tm adatoms are fast surface diffuser on graphene .",
    "al.@xcite indicated that clustering of the tm adatoms is energetically favorable for tm on graphene sheet .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to obtain stable magnetic order by tm absorbed on graphene .",
    "different from the case of tm adsorbed on graphene , the existence of additional @xmath2-@xmath3@xmath4/@xmath5 state of the _ sp _ hybridized carbon in gy makes it strongly bind to tm adatoms and easily trap the tm adatoms in the alkyne rings of gy.@xcite compared with the cluster effect of tm adatoms on graphene , dispersed adsorption of the tm adatoms on gy is energetically favor .",
    "it is well known that the long - range characteristics of the indirectly exchange coupling between magnetic adatoms mediated by hosts material play a significant role in determining the magnetic order of tm on real materials .",
    "for example , between two magnetic impurity in graphene follows ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) exchange coupling , which derived from the semi - metallic nature of graphene.@xcite to open the way for tm - gy applying in spintronics , it is essential to understand the magnetic alignment of tm adatoms adsorbed on the gy , especially their magnetic exchange coupling mediated by the _",
    "hybridized carbon atoms .",
    "+ one dimensional ( 1d ) tm monoatomic chain , whose magnetic properties are much different from those of bulk solid materials because of significant reduction in dimensionality , shows potential applications in spintronic devices , such as spin - dependent quantum transport properties , ballistic anomalous magnetoresistance,@xcite spin and magnetization tunneling@xcite .",
    "moreover , much researches@xcite have shown that the 1d tm metallic chain can lead to large magnetic anisotropy . in present work , using density functional theory plus hubbard - u ( dft+u ) approach we find that the tm adatoms on gy can be constructed as tm chain indicating that the gy is a potential template for synthesizing tm nanowire .",
    "such tm chain can behave as a metallic nanowire with spin - polarized currents or quantum channel bringing a new opportunity to construct integrated circuits using various combinations of connected monoatomic metallic wire based on gy .",
    "moreover , such monoatomic tm chains can be created on the surface of gy by stm tip manipulation@xcite . in view of the strong intermediate of _",
    "sp _ hybridized carbon atom , it is easy to retain a long range magnetic order on the surface of gy . the results in present work show that the tm exchange coupling of the zigzag tm nanowire mediated by",
    "hybridized carbon atoms gives rise to long range ferromagnetic order except for cr with anti - ferromagnetic order .",
    "the magnetic exchange interaction of tm chains follows like - zener s @xmath0-d exchange mechanism : the coexistence of out - of plane @xmath0-d and in - plane @xmath1-d exchange .",
    "furthermore , we find that fe and co chains show considerable magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) and orbital magnetic moment . the easy axis of the v , cr , mn and fe chains is perpendicular to the surface , whereas the easy axis of co lies in the surface .",
    "moreover , only v chain shows relatively larger in - plane anisotropy .",
    "our results open a new route to realize the applications of graphyne in spintronics .",

    "one of the most interesting issues is that : is the easy axis parallel or perpendicular to the gy plane ?",
    "+ to this end , we perform noncollinear magnetic calculation using the gga(pbe ) exchange - correction functional for tm - chain - gy . it well known that the mae is induced by spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effect . as for mae calculations , the soc effect are included .",

    "moreover , the orbital magnetic moment of co - chain - gy is similar to that of co chain on the pt(111 ) surface@xcite and co dimer adsorbed on graphene@xcite . to characterize the mae of tm - chain - gy systems ,",
