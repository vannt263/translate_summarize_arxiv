    "we formulate qcd on a 4-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice with a finite lattice spacing @xmath0 . when the lattice volume is also finite , the theory is completely finite and well - defined , so that supercomputers can be used to calculate non - perturbative quantities .",
    "numerous developments and ideas in the last two decades , both in algorithms for numerical computations and in the computer technology , have made lattice field theory one of the most powerful tools in computing the non - perturbative properties of qcd .",
    "in particular , the development of parallel computers in the late 90 s enabled us to start realistic and systematic simulations of qcd .    in order to extract predictions for the real world from the numerical results obtained on finite lattices ,",

    "extrapolate to large lattice volume .    here ,",
    "computations for the quark part contain inversions of a huge quark matrix , whose size is , for example , about @xmath1 for the case of a @xmath2 lattice . because the condition number of the quark matrix diverges as we decrease the quark mass , a calculation with light quarks is quite time - consuming .",
    "actually , even with the latest supercomputers with tflops level computational speeds , a direct simulation with the physical @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks is not possible .",
    "therefore , at present , we also have to    1 .   )",
    "extrapolate to light @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks ,    using data at around the @xmath5 quark mass region .    to obtain a reliable result for continuum physics",
    ", it is essential to have a good control of the systematic errors due to these extrapolations .",
    "a systematic approach is required . because of the huge amount of computations required , major calculations have been made in the quenched approximation , in which the effects of dynamical quark loops are ignored .",
    "a recent extensive study of quenched qcd by the cp - pacs collaboration @xcite , however , has shown a limitation of the quenched approximation . as a next logical step ,",
    "systematic `` full qcd '' simulations removing the quenched approximation have started . in this paper ,",
    "i summarize the latest status of lattice qcd simulations , choosing `` dynamical quark effects '' as the keyword .    in secs .",
    "[ sec : spectrum ] and [ sec : fspectrum ] , the latest results for the light hadron spectrum from lattice qcd are summarized .",
    "this provides us with the most direct test of qcd in the low - energy non - perturbative domain . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mq ] , lattice results for the mass of light quarks are discussed .",
    "[ sec : u1 ] is devoted to the status of the u(1 ) problem on the lattice . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fb ] , lattice results for @xmath6 meson decay constants are summarized .",
    "we find that , in all of these physics , dynamical quarks have significant effects .",
    "a short conclusion is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the computation of the hadronic mass spectrum directly from the first principles of qcd is one of the most important tasks of lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "if the lattice spectrum reproduces the experimental data , this will provide us with the most convincing demonstration of the validity of qcd as the fundamental theory for strong interactions in the low - energy non - perturbative domain .",
    "furthermore , through these calculations , we can see how the lattice qcd describes the real physics and what is required to achieve high accuracy suppressing lattice artifacts .",
    "another motivation is a determination of fundamental parameters in qcd ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : mq ] .    because huge computer power is required to overcome the systematic errors discussed in sec  [ sec : intro ] , major simulations have been done in the quenched approximation . with this approximation ,",
    "the amount of computations is reduced by a factor of several hundreds .",
    "recently , the cp - pacs collaboration performed a large - scale calculation of this with a precision significantly better than previous studies @xcite . using a dedicated massively parallel computer cp - pacs",
    "developed at the university of tsukuba @xcite , they studied four lattices @xmath7 to @xmath8 with lattice spacing in the range @xmath90.05 fm .",
    "the spacial lattice size was fixed to be about 3 fm with which the finite size effects are estimated to be maximally 0.5% in the spectrum . on each lattice ,",
    "five quark masses , corresponding to the mass ratio of pseudo - scalar and vector mesons @xmath100.4 , were studied .",
    "the light @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks were treated as degenerate .",
    "their final results in the continuum limit are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : qspectrum ] . the light quark mass @xmath11 and the lattice scale @xmath0 were fixed using the experimental values for @xmath12 and @xmath13 as inputs , while the @xmath5 quark mass was fixed either by @xmath14 ( @xmath15-input ) or @xmath16 ( @xmath17-input ) .",
    "see @xcite for details of the simulation and extrapolations .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : qspectrum ] , we see that , although the global pattern of the experimental spectrum is reproduced , there remain systematic discrepancies of up to about 10% ( 7 standard deviations ) between quenched qcd and experiment , for both choices of the input for the strange quark mass . because other systematic errors are well under control , these discrepancies might be due to the quenched approximation .",
    "in the previous section , a limitation of the quenched approximation was made clear .",
    "the next logical step is to perform a `` full qcd '' calculation removing the quenched approximation , to see if these discrepancies disappear with dynamical quarks .",
    "however , a naive extension of quenched simulations is difficult as the computational power required increases several hundred fold .",
    "recently , there was much progress in improving lattice actions , with which lattice artifacts due to finite lattice spacing are reduced .",
    "therefore , a coarser lattice may be used for continuum extrapolations with correspondingly less computer time .",
    "= 7.5 cm    the cp - pacs collaboration adopted the combination of an rg - improved gauge action and a `` clover''-type improved wilson quark action , and carried out the first systematic investigation of full qcd .",
    "two flavors of dynamical quarks , to be identified with degenerate @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks , are simulated @xcite .",
    "the heavier @xmath5 quark was treated in the quenched approximation .",
    "we may ask ourselves if we can actually see an effect of dynamical quarks on the present lattice .",
    "the most direct signals of dynamical quarks will be decays , such as @xmath18 , and the breaking of the confining string for the static quark potential .",
    "it turned out that these phenomena are inaccesible from the current simulation parameters ( quark mass , lattice size , etc . ) @xcite .",
    "we can , however , see an effect of dynamical quarks in the short range physics : the phenomenological string tension @xmath19 from the charmonium spectrum , is considered to represent the physics at a scale @xmath20600 mev .",
    "therefore , when we compare the quenched and full qcd at the same lattice string tension , we are connecting the two theories at @xmath20600 mev .",
    "because the running of effective coupling is different between quenched and full qcd , we should see a difference in the coulomb coefficient @xmath21 which represents the physics at @xmath222 gev @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] , results for @xmath21 obtained on a @xmath23 lattice are shown for full and quenched qcd at the same lattice string tension @xcite . as expected ,",
    "the full qcd results are larger than the quenched value at @xmath24 , and increase as the sea quark becomes lighter . the horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] is an expected value for @xmath21 at @xmath25 in full qcd , estimated from the quenched value using the two - loop beta function with two flavors of massless quarks .",
    "the full qcd values for light sea quarks are consistent with this estimate .",
    "therefore , we do have dynamical quark effects with the expected magnitude .    now , we study implications of dynamical quarks in non - perturbative physics .",
    "figure  [ fig : fspectrum ] shows the lattice spacing dependence of hadron masses from @xmath26 full qcd , compared with quenched masses .",
    "plotted together are the results of a quenched calculation using the same improved action as in the full qcd calculation , with which one - to - one comparisons between quenched and full qcd results from calculations with similar parameters are made possible .",
    "we see that both quenched calculations lead to universal values for hadron spectrum in the continuum limit , and the discrepancies from experiment in quenched spectrum are much reduced by two flavors of dynamical quarks .",
    "the remaining difference might be caused by the quenching of the @xmath5 quark .",
    "massses of quarks belong to the most fundamental parameters of qcd .",
    "because quarks are confined in hadrons , their masses have to be indirectly inferred from hadronic observables using the functional relation between these hadronic quantities and qcd parameters .",
    "a lattice qcd determination of the hadron spectrum provides us with such functional relations without resorting to a phenomenological model .",
    ".results for quark masses in the @xmath27 scheme at 2 gev [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : quarkmass ]    on the lattice , there exist several alternative definitions for quark mass",
    ". they should converge to a universal value in the continuum limit .",
    "the cp - pacs collaboration observed that light quark masses determined from either the vector ward identity ( vwi ) or the axial - vector ward identity ( awi ) , while differing at finite lattice spacings , actually converge to a common value in the continuum limit @xcite . see fig .",
    "[ fig : ms ] .",
    "however , in the quenched qcd , the resulting value for @xmath28 differs by about 20% between @xmath15-input and @xmath17-input , due to the discrepancy of quenched spectrum from experiment discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectrum ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ms ] , @xmath26 full qcd values , as well as quenched values with the improved action , are also plotted @xcite .",
    "we again find that the two quenched simulations lead to a universal value in the continuum limit .",
    "results for the light quark masses in the continuum limit are summarized in table [ tab : quarkmass ] .",
    "the discrepancy between the @xmath15 and @xmath17-inputs becomes much smaller in full qcd .",
    "the most impressive point is that the values predicted through full qcd are 2030% smaller than those in the quenched qcd . in particular , the @xmath5 quark mass in two - flavor full qcd is about 90100 mev , which is significantly smaller than the phenomenological value @xmath29 mev often used in hadron phenomenology , and almost saturating an estimate of the lower bound 90100 mev from qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "another important issue in qcd is the @xmath30 problem , that is to clarify the mechanism for a large @xmath31 meson mass .",
    "propagators of flavor non - singlet meson consist of a loop of valence quark propagator , while propagators of flavor singlet @xmath31 meson have an additional contribution with two disconnected valence quark loops .",
    "the fact that @xmath32 is much heavier than the corresponding non - singlet meson @xmath33 means that the two - loop contribution should exactly cancel the @xmath33 pole of the one - loop contribution , leaving the heavy @xmath32 pole .",
    "this phenomenon is considered to be related with the anomalous violation of the flavor singlet axial u(1 ) symmetry and topological structure of gauge field configurations in qcd .",
    "this is a critical test of qcd and can be answered using lattice qcd .",
    "calculation of the two - loop contribution requires a large amount of computations . for this reason only limited results have been available . the first systematic investigation in full qcd including continuum extrapolations",
    "was recently done by the cp - pacs collaboration @xcite . in an approximation ignoring with the @xmath34 state ,",
    "the flavor - singlet @xmath35 meson mass was estimated as @xmath36  mev . in the real world , the @xmath35 state mixes with the @xmath34 state to lead to @xmath37(547 ) and @xmath32(958 ) mesons .",
    "therefore , the result @xmath38  mev which is slightly smaller than the experimental value 958  mev is quite encouraging .",
    "further studies , including an inspection of the mixing with the @xmath34 state as well as the study of topological structures , are under way .",
    "the study of the non - perturbative properties of qcd is important also to investigate the weinberg - salam theory for the electro - weak interactions @xcite . in order to determine ckm parameters for quarks , we need to know qcd corrections ( hadronic matrix elements , form factors , etc . ) in weak decays and mixings . in particular , properties of heavy mesons consisting of a @xmath39 quark are being studied intensively by the b factories . the precise determination of the decay constants and @xmath6-parameters for @xmath40 and @xmath41 mesons will lead to a strong constraint on the value of ckm parameters .",
    "the lattice calculation of these quantities are beginning to contribute in reducing the ambiguities in these studies @xcite .",
    "major calculations have been done in the quenched approximation .",
    "recently , full qcd calculations of the decay constants @xmath42 and @xmath43 have been made by several groups . in this section ,",
    "i concentrate on the dynamical quark effects in these decay constants .    on the lattice , simulation of the heavy @xmath39 quark",
    "is not a trivial extension of light quark simulations , because @xmath44 gev is larger than the lattice cutoff @xmath454 gev to date .",
    "two methods have been developed to simulate heavy quarks directly .",
    "one is based on a non - relativistic effective theory of qcd ( nrqcd ) defined through an expansion in the inverse heavy quark mass @xcite .",
    "another employs a relativistic action and reinterpret it in terms of a non - relativistic hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "= 6.5 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fball ] , i collect recent lattice results for @xmath42 from quenched @xcite and full qcd studies @xcite . in the figure , `` extrap . '' is a result of an extrapolation from light quark mass region , and `` nrqcd '' and `` relativistic '' are the results of the lattice nrqcd method and the relativistic method .",
    "estimated statistical and systematic errors are included .",
    "although the errors are still large , we can see that both methods are approximately consistent with each other . comparing the quenched results ( @xmath46 ) and the full qcd @xmath47 results ,",
    "the latters seem to be about 10% larger than the former values . from this figure ,",
    "i estimate @xmath48 mev . also for the case of @xmath43 , increase of a similar magnitude",
    "is observed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoeta ] , the implication of the lattice results for @xmath42 and @xmath43 on the unitarity triangle of ckm parameters is summarized for @xmath49 and @xmath50 using the wolfenstein parameterization ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "regions surrounded by two arcs are the allowed regions from each constraints , except for the two thin dashed lines denoted as @xmath51 which show the range of lower bounds for @xmath52 . in this figure , the quenched lattice results for @xmath53 , @xmath54 , etc .",
    "are used in the constraints from @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite , while two - flavor full qcd results for @xmath42 and @xmath43 are used for the constraints from @xmath57 and @xmath51 .",
    "allowed region from all the constraints is shaded by thick lines .",
    "the increase of @xmath42 due to the dynamical light quarks causes a shift of the allowed region from @xmath57 towards positive @xmath58 , leading to a more severe constraint .",
    "the region shaded by thin lines is the allowed region from the conventional phenomenological estimates for hadronic matrix elements @xcite .",
    "hence , lattice results are contributing to reduce errors in the determination of ckm parameters .",
    "due to the large computer power required , major lattice simulations have been made in the quenched approximation , in which the dynamical sea quark effects are ignored . recently , it became possible to start realistic and systematic simulations of qcd with dynamical quarks , through the development of parallel computers .",
    "from the first simulations , it turned out that dynamical quark effects are quite important .",
