    "a particle - in - cell / monte - carlo ( pic / mc ) simulation ( van der straaten et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 ) and semi - analytic treatment ( cramer , 1997 ) of the radial structure of a low pressure dc cylindrical magnetron discharge has revealed a potential and electric field structure highly dependent on the pressure and magnetic field . as either the pressure was reduced or the magnetic field was increased , the steady state discharge was found to exhibit a transition from a positive space charge mode ( psc ) , characterised by a strong cathode fall as occurs in an unmagnetised glow discharge , to a negative space charge mode ( nsc ) characterised by a broad anode fall .",
    "the reason for the transition to the nsc mode is the strongly reduced ( according to classical theory ) transport of electrons across the magnetic field in a low pressure , strongly magnetised plasma .",
    "these two modes of the magnetised discharge have been discussed by thornton and penfold ( 1978 ) .",
    "there is little conclusive experimental evidence for the nsc mode .",
    "the cathode fall is always observed in planar magnetron experiments , even at very low pressures ( rossnagel and kaufmann 1986 , gu and lieberman 1988 ) .",
    "experiments by yeom et al .",
    "( 1989 ) with a cylindrical magnetron with pressures and magnetic fields similar to those considered in this paper and in the pic simulation study ( van der straaten et al .",
    "1997 ) showed a distinct cathode fall and no anode fall over the entire range of discharge parameters .",
    "langmuir probe measurements in a cylindrical magnetron were also reported by van der straaten et al .",
    "( 1997 ) with the same discharge parameters as used in the simulation , but the results did not agree with the simulation results in that no anode fall was observed at low pressures and high magnetic fields . however , hayakawa and wasa ( 1965 ) reported the existence of a stable discharge operating in what appeared to be the nsc mode .",
    "the discharge featured a broad anode fall for a magnetic field strength greater than 4 kg , which is considerably higher than the field strength predicted by the fluid model and the simulations ( @xmath0 kg ) for the onset of the nsc mode . in order to explain the persistence of the cathode fall in the experimental results it would be necessary for the electron transport across the magnetic field , at low pressures and high magnetic field strengths , to be considerably higher than is predicted by the classical transport coefficients .",
    "it has been postulated ( eg sheridan and goree 1989 ) that turbulence or nonlinear coherent modes induced by instabilities in the partially ionized plasma in crossed electric and magnetic fields ( simon 1963 ) may increase the diffusion and drift of electrons , thus increasing their effective transport coefficients",
    ".    dust macroparticles in a discharge are negatively charged , but are unmagnetized because of their high mass .",
    "the electrons are highly magnetized , and the ions have intermediate magnetization .",
    "this results in different transport rates of the different species across the magnetic field . depending on the size of the magnetic field , and the relative charge on the different species",
    ", the dust grains can be the dominant current carrier .",
    "the space charge clouds near the electrodes will then be determined by the relative mobility of the different species .",
    "the two modes of the discharge will then be affected by the charge on , and the current carried by the dust grains .",
    "features unique to the dust particles can also play a role in the structure of the discharge , such as the variable equilibrium charge on the grains , dependent on the local potential and species temperatures , the effect of gravity on the grain dynamics , and the rate of charging of the grains .",
    "the dust grains can also form an ordered structure , the dust - plasma crystal . a fluid model of the different species",
    "is used to calculate the structure of the resulting discharge , incorporating the above effects . the transition from the psc mode to the nsc mode as the magnetic field , pressure and dust properties",
    "are varied is demonstrated .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional model of a magnetron discharge between two parallel plate electrodes , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "we assume a one - dimensional steady state distribution so that all quantities are a function only of the distance @xmath1 from the cathode surface .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath2 is uniform and directed parallel to the cathode surface .",
    "the ions and dust grains are assumed to be unaffected by the magnetic field , i.e. the ion and dust larmor radii are assumed to be much larger than the distance @xmath3 between the anode and the cathode .",
    "the electrons have two components of drift velocity , @xmath4 transverse to the magnetic field in the @xmath1-direction , and @xmath5 perpendicular to both the electric field @xmath6 and to @xmath7 , where    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the @xmath1-component of @xmath6 ( negative in this case ) , @xmath10 is the electron - cyclotron frequency and @xmath11 is the collision frequency of electrons with background gas atoms .",
    "the resultant drift of the electrons is at an angle @xmath12 to the @xmath1-axis given by @xmath13 the basic equations used are those of davies and evans ( 1980 ) , modified to include the magnetic field and the dust .",
    "thus we use poisson s equation in one dimension , i.e.    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the net charge density and @xmath16 is the permittivity of free space . this equation may be rewritten as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the ion drift velocity in the @xmath1-direction ( negative in this case ) , @xmath19 is the dust grain drift velocity , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the ion , electron and dust current densities in the @xmath1-direction .",
    "the dust current density is @xmath23 where we assume a constant flux of dust particles , with initial density and velocity @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the dust charge varies in the discharge due to the varying local potential .",
    "writing the total current density as @xmath26 , and assuming @xmath27 , we have    @xmath28 is the fraction of the total current density due to electrons .",
    "a boundary condition that can be applied is that the electron current at the cathode is due solely to secondary emission of electrons caused by ion impact on the cathode .",
    "the secondary emission coefficient @xmath29 at the cathode is assumed known .",
    "the second basic equation we use is the electron charge conservation equation , or ionization avalanche equation .",
    "the electrons drift through the background neutral gas at the angle @xmath12 to the @xmath1-axis and ionize the neutral gas molecules , and electron avalanches are formed .",
    "these avalanches are therefore also inclined at the angle @xmath12 to the @xmath1-axis .",
    "if the coordinate along this direction is @xmath30 , the normalized electron current density in this direction is @xmath31 and the electric field in this direction is @xmath32 , and the ionization equation may be written    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is townsend s 1st ionization coefficient ( llewellyn - jones 1966 ) ,    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants depending on the gas , @xmath38 is the gas pressure and @xmath39 for a monatomic gas .",
    "since @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , [ jeq ] becomes    @xmath43    the only difference in equation ( [ current ] ) to the unmagnetized case is therefore the replacement of the pressure @xmath38 by the  effective pressure \" @xmath44 .",
    "the ion mobility is assumed unaffected by the magnetic field , so we assume , as do davies and evans ( 1980 ) , that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a constant .",
    "this gives a good representation of the experimental ion drift ( ward 1962 ) .",
    "however we note that this means that the ion and electron drift velocities have different @xmath9 dependences , so @xmath47 is not strictly independent of @xmath9 as we have assumed so far .",
    "a dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath9 would prevent the application of the analysis used here , so we neglect it , noting that it could cause an error in our results at high magnetic fields .",
    "the charge of a ( negatively charged ) dust particle is determined by the current balance equation @xmath48 = n_0v_{e}\\exp\\left [ \\frac{eq_d(z)}{at_e}+\\frac{e\\varphi(z)}{t_e}\\right].\\ ] ]",
    "the equations have been solved for a number of cases , using the above prescription , to illustrate the effect on the discharge of increasing the magnetic field and the density of dust particles .",
    "the parameters used in the numerical examples are those of van der straaten et al ( 1994 ) , viz .",
    "@xmath49 cm , @xmath50mtorr and 50mtorr , and argon gas , for which @xmath51 , @xmath52 , electron mobility for zero magnetic field @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the corresponding electron collision frequency is @xmath55 where @xmath38 is in torr .",
    "the ratio of ion and electron mobilities in the unmagnetized gas is @xmath56 ( ward 1962 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the electric field , ion velocity and space charge profiles for a pressure of 5mtorr .",
    "the cathode is at @xmath57 and the anode is at @xmath58 cm .",
    "no magnetic field and no dust is present , and the potential drop = 209v .",

    "a numerical solution of the electron , ion and dust fluid transport equations for a magnetized discharge has been developed , building on previous work for an unmagnetized steady - state glow discharge .",
    "understanding the transport of charged particles across the magnetic field is important for modelling the operation of magnetron devices used in plasma processing for industry .",
    "the effects of charge on the dust particles on the transition from a positive space charge mode to a negative space charge mode as the magnetic field is increased or the pressure is reduced has been demonstrated .",
    "the presence of dust can create a negative space charge region near the anode , which enhances or mimics the effect of a magnetic field .",
    "if however the field is so strong that the ions are magnetized ( future work ) , the dust grains may carry most of the current , which will enhance the positive space charge region .",
