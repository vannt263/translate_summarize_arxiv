    "the realization of potentials with controlled disorder for ultracold atoms by means of optical speckle fields @xcite or bichromatic optical lattices @xcite has recently led to the observation of anderson localization with bose - einstein condensates @xcite . in those experiments , atomic bose - einstein condensates , prepared in a harmonic trap ,",

    "clearly , a key condition for the observability of anderson localization with ultracold atomic gases is the overall coherence of the atomic cloud .",
    "any mechanism of decoherence would compromise the phenomenon of destructive wave interference that lies at the heart of anderson localization @xcite and thereby give rise to delocalization .",
    "this also concerns any _ in - situ _ monitoring of the evolution of the atomic cloud during its expansion , by intermediate measurements of the positions of atoms .",
    "evidently , the strong refocusing of the atomic wavefunction that results from a precise position measurement would destroy the coherence of the atom , enhance its kinetic energy , and eventually let the atom behave as a classical particle when being performed several times .",

    "an atom , which is initially localized within a harmonic trap at the center , is expanding within a one - dimensional waveguide ( indicated by the green horizontal lines ) to which a disordered potential is superimposed .",
    "a periodic array of optical microcavities ( symbolized by the red arcs ) is used to measure the position of the atom , on a length scale that is comparable to its localization length ( indicated by the shadow plot in the waveguide , which shows the density of a localized state ) . for this purpose ,",
    "the waveguide is considered to be irradiated by a near - resonant laser beam , which may induce spontaneous emissions of photons into one of the cavities , possibly to be measured by photodetectors .",
    "the sketch is to scale with the parameters considered in this study , as far as the horizontal length scales are concerned . ]",
    "the situation is less obvious for `` weak '' measurement processes , in which the position of the atom is determined with a large spatial uncertainty that is of the order of the expected localization length within the disordered potential .",
    "such weak measurements might still preserve coherence to a certain extent , while , at the same time , providing some rough _ in - situ _ information on the position of the atom .",
    "one could , for this purpose , conceive _",
    "e.g. _   a periodic array of optical microcavities placed around the waveguide in which the atoms propagate , as depicted in fig .",

    "can be used to transfer the atoms to an electronically excited state , from which they can relax to the ground state by a spontaneous emission of a photon into one of the cavities , which in turn could be measured by photodetectors placed behind the cavities .",
    "the whole configuration could possibly be fabricated on `` atom chips '' @xcite , in which case the disordered potential could arise from imperfections in the current - carrying wires that generate the magnetic waveguide potential of the atoms @xcite .",
    "our results below are , however , more general and we expect to see the same effects on the localization in the presence of any mechanism of similar position measurement .    the aim of this study is to investigate to which extent this approximate realization of a `` heisenberg microscope '' gives rise to delocalization of an atom in a one - dimensional disordered potential . for the sake of simplicity , we shall restrict our consideration to the propagation of one single atom , and thereby discard collective processes arising within bose - einstein condensates due to atom - atom interactions or superradiance .",
    "we shall , moreover , assume that the atom will emit photons into one single mode of the cavities only .",
    "such an emission will then give rise to a recoil that is mainly perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the atom and does therefore not dramatically enhance its longitudinal kinetic energy .",
    "we neglect effects of transverse excitations within the waveguide due to this recoil and assume that neither the effective waveguide confinement nor the disordered potential are affected by temporary populations of the excited electronic state of the atom .",
    "the dynamics of the atom is modeled via a one - dimensional master equation for its density matrix @xmath0 , which can be unraveled using the monte - carlo wavefunction technique @xcite .",
    "this master equation accounts both for the coherent motion within the disordered potential and the incoherent scattering of photons @xcite . we shall , in section [ sec : wavepacketexpansion ] , first account on the expansion and localization dynamics of a single atom in a one - dimensional disordered potential in the absence of any decoherence mechanism . in section [ sec : masterequation ]",
    ", we outline the monte - carlo wavefunction approach that is used to integrate the master equation for the special case of an atom that propagates in a homogeneous , disorder - free waveguide .",
    "decoherence and disorder are finally put together in section [ sec : disdis ] , in which we discuss the expansion of an atomic wave packet in the presence of disorder and spontaneous emission .",
    "we show that even very rare position measurements of the atom give , on average , rise to a gradual delocalization of the wave packet , and we provide numerical evidence for superballistic expansion in the presence of strong emission rates .",

    "the subsequent localization process projects the wavefunction on those high - momentum components , which gives rise to a permanent drift .",
    "the rms width , however , remains small during this evolution , which is due to the fact that the atom emits photons at a rate that is faster than the inverse dispersion time of the wave packet .",
    "the rms width would freeze for sufficiently high emission rates , which is reminiscent of the quantum zeno effect .",
    "it is of great advantage to work in a regime where @xmath72 is small compared to fluctuations of the density matrix in momentum space @xmath86 . to study the momentum density distribution",

    "@xcite . taking the integral over @xmath72 leads to the diffusion equation @xmath87 for the diagonal elements of the density matrix , with the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath88 .",
    "hence , the wave packet will undergo diffusive spreading in momentum space . noting that the variance of the momentum distribution is nothing but the kinetic energy , we obtain @xmath89 for the growth of the mean kinetic energy of the wave packet .",
    "having introduced the necessary tools , we now study wave packet expansion in the presence of disorder and dissipation . in fig .",
    "[ masterdynamics1 ] we plot the participation ratio as a function of time for different effective emission rates @xmath90 . in accordance with the sketch shown in fig .",

    "the amount of kinetic energy given to the wave packet at each emission event is thereby rather reduced .    .",

    "the most important observation is a delocalization of the wave packet at any emission rate . instead of saturating to a stationary value ,",
    "the participation ratio linearly increases with time after the typical time scale that is needed for developing an anderson - localized density profile in the absence of spontaneous emission .",
    "quantitatively , this linear growth is very different from a ballistic expansion in free space , which takes place with much faster expansion velocities ( see the dashed lines in fig .  [ part ] ) .",
    "it is also different from simple diffusion which one would naively expect to prevail for a quantum particle that propagates within a disordered potential in the presence of a decoherence mechanism .",
    "we attribute this difference to the fact that the spontaneous emission of a photon gives rise to a recoil of the atom and thereby increases its energy .",
    "hence , the effective diffusion constant should also gradually increase with time .",
    "it is , in this context , interesting to note that the expansion velocity @xmath98 depends only on the product of the effective rate of emission @xmath90 and the recoil energy @xmath99 .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the two blue lines in the two panels of fig .",

    ". there appears , furthermore , no change in the behavior when we tune the rate of emissions across the scale @xmath103 , with @xmath104 the time at which the unperturbed evolution shows localization .",
    "it is tempting to relate the linear increase of the participation rate with time to the combination of a linear growth of the kinetic energy due to spontaneous emission with the approximately linear scaling of the wave packet s localization length with its mean kinetic energy in the absence of spontaneous emission , as shown in fig .",
    "[ energydep1 ] .",
    "this reasoning essentially assumes that in between two subsequent spontaneous emission events the wave packet has enough time to approach its asymptotic stationary profile within the disordered potential . extracting from fig .",
    "[ energydep1 ] the approximate scaling @xmath105 and using @xmath106 for the growth rate of the energy according to eq .",

    "the data are extracted from fig .",
    "[ masterdynamics1 ] , as well as from other calculations using different parameters for @xmath90 and @xmath72 , through linear regression of the participation ratio within @xmath110 .",
    "as confirmed in the log - log plot shown in the inset , @xmath98 scales as the square root of @xmath111 : we have @xmath112 with the fitted proportionality constant @xmath113 , as indicated by the dashed line .",
    "the dash - dotted straight line in the main panel represents the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ linexp ] ) .",
    "[ expansionrate ] ]    figure [ expansionrate ] shows , however , that this expansion velocity increases more strongly with the rate of increase of the kinetic energy than predicted by eq .",
    "( [ linexp ] ) . as a matter of fact , @xmath98 is found to scale as a square root of @xmath111 in the parameter regime in which we carried out our numerical investigations .",
    "one may attribute this behavior to the fact that the above reasoning rather applies to an _ individual _ quantum trajectory in the spirit of fig .",
    "[ freetrajectory ] .",
    "the energy of the wavepacket corresponding to each individual trajectory increases linearly and its participation ratio increases on average as described by eq .",
    "( [ linexp ] ) .",
    "however , while different trajectories describe similar narrow wavepackets , each wavepacket will be centered around a different point in space .",
    "thus the full ( incoherent ) density will be spreading faster over a larger region than a single wavepacket ( as is obvious from fig .",
    "[ freetrajectory ] for the case of disorder - free propagation ) .",
    "this effect is obviously not accounted for in the considerations leading to eq .",

    "the disordered potential is characterized by the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath8 .",
    "we note that the growth of @xmath115 for @xmath116 @xmath11 ( green curve ) coincides with the one of a free ballistic expansion , while superballistic expansion is encountered for larger emission rates . ]",
    "let us finally investigate the regime of strong dissipation for which it is expected that the expansion becomes independent of the disordered potential . in fig .",
    "[ disk5 ] the momentum recoil is set to @xmath117 , leading to a regime in which the rms width turns out to serve as an accurate measure of expansion . in this case , the recoil induced by the emitted photons may drive the system beyond the free ballistic growth into a superballistic regime , which is the valid limit of a driven expansion in free space @xcite . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ disk5 ] , this superballistic regime sets in beyond @xmath118 for @xmath117 .",
    "in summary , we have shown that even a very weak rate of photon scattering gives rise to a breakdown of anderson localization of an atom that propagates in a one - dimensional disordered potential .",
    "this breakdown is most conveniently quantified in terms of the disorder - averaged participation ratio of the atomic density , which represents a measure for the spatial width of the atomic wave packet . while this participation ratio saturates , within a characteristic time scale , to a finite value in the case of a perfectly coherent expansion process within the disordered potential , it is found to linearly",
    "grow with time beyond that time scale in the presence of spontaneous photon scattering .",
    "this growth behavior imposes strong limits for the observability of anderson localization in the presence of a weak position measurement of the atom . however , an experimental realization of a `` heisenberg microscope '' for cold atoms according to the scheme displayed in fig .  [ setup ] might nevertheless be of interest as it allows one to study in more detail the interplay of disorder and measurement - induced delocalization phenomena not only for a single atom , but also ( and this more naturally ) for a bose - einstein condensate in which the atoms interact with each other . for this purpose ,",
    "an integrated setup on atom chips appears as the most convenient realization of such a heisenberg microscope for atomic gases .",
    "finally , we expect similar findings in the presence of other mechanisms that can behave as a position measurement of the propagating atom .",
    "such mechanisms include noise on the lattice beams as well as collisions with background gas atoms , to mention two examples .",
    "undesired effects of this type are therefore also expected to induce a delocalization of the atom in the disorder potential ."
