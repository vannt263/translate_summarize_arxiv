    "radiation pressure has been long recognised as effective at powering mass - loss from luminous stars .",
    "it has been shown that stars with luminosities as low as 0.1 per cent of their eddington limit can produce a powerful high velocity wind , when the transmission of radiation pressure to a flow via spectral line opacity is included .",
    "studies of stellar winds driven by radiation pressure due to lines began more than two decades ago ( lucy & solomon 1970 ; castor , abbott & klein 1975 , hereafter cak ) .",
    "later theoretical work by friend & abbott ( 1986 ) and pauldrach , puls & kudritzki ( 1986 ; hereafter ppk ) modified the cak method and reproduced well empirically estimated time - averaged mass - loss rates and terminal velocities for main - sequence and evolved ob stars .",
    "after these successes of the modified cak method , increasingly more attention has been paid to the instabilities inherent in the line - driving mechanism ( e.g. , owocki , castor & rybicki 1988 , here after ocr ; puls , owocki & fullerton 1993 ) and multi - dimensional aspects of stellar winds ( e.g. , bjorkman & cassinelli 1993 ; owocki , cranmer & blondin 1994 ) .",
    "a strong radiation field can also be produced by accretion discs , which are believed to be important and common components in many astrophysical objects , for example , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , high mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) and agns .",
    "many of these objects show evidence of high velocity winds coming from the disk itself ( e.g. , drew 1997 ; mundt & ray 1994 ; weymann et al .",
    "small wonder then , that radiation pressure has been proposed to power mass - loss also from accretion discs .    despite a deep and quantitative understanding of radiation - driven winds in stars",
    "it has not been straightforward to demonstrate that radiation can produce strong and fast winds from discs .",
    "the basic difficulty is the intrinsically two - dimensional , axisymmetric nature of disc winds .",
    "first studies of disc winds were focused on finding semi - analytic time - independent solutions .",
    "such an approach required some simplifications and assumptions which had an essential influence on the final outcome ( e.g. , vitello & shlosman 1988 ; murray et al 1995 ) . nevertheless these studies illustrated in more detail the basic differences between driving a wind from a stellar photosphere and a disc photosphere .",
    "for example , vitello & shlosman showed that an increase of the vertical gravity component with height from the disc midplane prevents a disc from producing a wind unless the vertical component of the radiation pressure also increases with height .",
    "numerical treatments of the disc wind problem have proven to be more successful as they allow solving of the multidimensional dynamical equations from first principles",
    ". relatively early work by icke  ( 1980 ; 1981 ) using two - dimensional , time - dependent numerical simulations showed how radiation pressure due to electrons can produce a disc wind .",
    "more recently pereyra , kallman & blondin ( 1997 , see also pereyra 1997 ) presented numerical calculations of the dimensional structure of line - driven disc winds for cvs .",
    "however their spatial resolution of wind near a disc was too coarse to capture the wind structure in that critical region .",
    "proga , stone & drew ( 1998 , hereafter psd ) developed another numerical treatment of disc winds .",
    "psd have identified the inner and near disc as the important spatial domain and have therefore used a non - uniform ( up to 200 @xmath0 200 ) grid to ensure that the subsonic acceleration zone near the disc surface is well sampled .",
    "psd explored the impact upon the mass - loss rate and outflow geometry caused by varying the system luminosity and the radiation field geometry .",
    "a striking outcome of psd s study has been the finding that winds driven from , and illuminated solely by , an accretion disc yield complex , unsteady outflow . in this case ,",
    "time - independent quantities can be determined only after averaging over several flow timescales . on the other hand ,",
    "if winds are illuminated by radiation dominated by the central star , then the disc yields steady outflow .",
    "psd also found that the mass - loss rate is a strong function of the total luminosity , while the outflow geometry is determined by the geometry of the radiation field .",
    "in particular , for high system luminosities , the disc mass - loss rate scales with the effective eddington luminosity in a way similar to stellar mass loss .",
    "as the system luminosity decreases below a critical value ( about twice the eddington limit ) , the mass - loss rate decreases quickly to zero .",
    "psd s calculations have been motivated by and designed for the case of winds from cvs .",
    "their findings are in qualitative agreement with the kinematics of cv outflows inferred from spectroscopic observations . in a second paper ( drew , proga & stone 1998 ; hereafter dps ) they considered both the star and the disc as a source of mass . for model parameters suitable for a typical high mass yso , where the stellar luminosity is @xmath1 orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic disc luminosity , their radiation - driven wind disc model might explain the extreme mass - loss signatures of these objects .",
    "most recently oudmaijer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) followed dps and calculated a model for a b star surrounded by an optically thick disc .",
    "the resulting wind configuration could match with the wind structure in b[e ] stars .",
    "in particular , oudmaijer et al.s results show that the kinematic properties of the wind might explain the observed spectral features in hd 87643 .    in this paper",
    "we look at the problem of scaling disc mass - loss rates and terminal velocities with model parameters .",
    "we will use results presented by psd and dps and use their approach to calculate some new results .",
    "additionally we will review results for stellar winds to compare them with numerical results for disc winds .",
    "for that we will calculate some new stellar wind models for a parameter space not explored before .",
    "these new stellar calculations are for relatively low luminosities , like those of white dwarfs and/or a very low increase of radiation pressure due to lines as in highly ionized or low metallicity winds .",
    "we would like to point out that we treat our comparison between models of stellar and disc winds quite formally as our goal is to identify what and how model parameters control the mass - loss rate and velocity of disc winds .",
    "the resulting scaling relations will allow a better understanding of line - driving in general and also give some tools to estimate disc wind properties for many astrophysical applications before calculating detailed multidimensional time - dependent numerical models .",
    "we describe our numerical calculations in section 2 , present and compare our results in section 3 , and conclude with a discussion in section 4 .",
    "the appendix summarizes the analytic results for @xmath2 and the velocity law in the cak framework .",
    "ranges of the model parameters which we have explored . [ cols= \" <",
    ", < \" , ]     \\a ) we re - estimated a typical velocity for this model .",
    "1(a ) also shows numerical results for the disc mass - loss rate , @xmath3 , from psd ( with a new point for @xmath4 , see table  3 ) , and for disc wind models with infinite @xmath5 , the open circles and triangles , respectively .",
    "psd results are analogous to stellar results in the @xmath6 case , while disc results with infinite @xmath5 are analogous to stellar results for the @xmath7 case .",
    "comparison between these analogue models demonstrates that the stellar mass - loss rate and the disc mass - loss rate depend on luminosity in a similar way for all luminosities .",
    "the most convincing case is for disc wind models with infinite @xmath5 where disc mass - loss rate predictions almost match the results for the stellar @xmath8 case . in the @xmath6 case , lower @xmath3 approaches @xmath9 in the stellar @xmath10 and @xmath8 cases as the eddington number increases .",
    "1(b ) illustrates the behavior of @xmath11 with the eddington number .",
    "the cak theory predicts that @xmath11 stays almost constant with @xmath12 for @xmath13 ( see equation a13 ) .",
    "friend & abbott ( 1986 ) showed that the finite disc factor introduces a dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath12 but it is a weak dependence .",
    "our calculations confirm these results and also confirm that @xmath11 is higher for the @xmath8 case than for the @xmath14 case by a factor of @xmath1 ( friend & abbott 1986 ; ppk ) . however",
    "if we take into account @xmath5 , @xmath11 decreases strongly with decreasing @xmath12 ( see also equation a22 ) .    comparing results shown in fig .  1",
    ", we find that for the @xmath10 case @xmath11 remains sensitive to @xmath5 for higher @xmath12 than @xmath9 .",
    "quantitatively @xmath11 in the @xmath10 case starts to deviate from @xmath11 in the @xmath8 case at @xmath15 while @xmath9 starts to deviate at @xmath16 higher than the former by a factor of @xmath17 .",
    "this is unsurprising , given that the terminal velocity of stellar winds is a global quantity determined in the whole acceleration zone whereas @xmath2 is a local quantity determined at the critical point and conserved in steady state models ( see also abbott & friend 1989 ) .",
    "the characteristic velocity of disk winds does not depend on the eddington number for infinite @xmath5 .",
    "however for @xmath18 , the characteristic velocity is a strong function of @xmath19 .",
    "thus the disk wind velocity and the stellar wind velocity are sensitive to the eddington number in similar ways .",
    "the main difference is that disc winds react to finite @xmath5 for higher eddington number than stellar winds .",
    "this difference indicates that @xmath20 is higher for discs than for stars .",
    "so far we showed that a finite @xmath5 reduces @xmath9 and @xmath11 significantly unless @xmath21 .",
    "in the regime where @xmath22 the actual value of @xmath5 does not matter and @xmath9 and @xmath11 do not depend on @xmath5 nor @xmath23 . as cak found the main stellar properties",
    "are determined at the wind critical point .",
    "for example , equation ( a18 ) shows how the mass - loss rate depends on the force multiplier at the critical point .",
    "we can also express wind terminal velocity as a function of @xmath20 : @xmath24 ( see the appendix ) . thus luminous stars do not use all their available effective radiative force to drive winds .",
    "however for low luminosity stars , the importance of @xmath5 and the effective luminosity is essential as @xmath5 limits @xmath20 .",
    "for example , equation ( a22 ) shows that in a first order approximation @xmath25 ( see equation 7 ) .",
    "physically , it means that if the force multiplier is saturated the radiation pressure accelerates the wind maximally which is proportional to @xmath26 , in the single - scattering limit . additionally , as we showed in fig .",
    "1 for the stellar case and psd showed for the disc case , radiation pressure can not drive a wind if @xmath27 , that is if the effective luminosity is less than the eddington luminosity .    to confirm further that disc winds behave in the same way as stellar winds we calculated a test model to compare with psd s fiducial steady model for @xmath28 ( their model 8) . for the test model",
    "all parameters are as for the fiducial model except for @xmath29 , increased by a factor of @xmath30 , and @xmath31 decreased by the same factor . with these parameters",
    "our test model has @xmath32 the same as the fiducial model and the eddington numbers as psd s model 9 .",
    "the results of our test model confirm expectations : the test model has @xmath2 as psd s model 9 with the same @xmath33 and @xmath34 as psd s model 8 should be @xmath35 instead of @xmath36 . ] with the same @xmath37 .",
    "the test model also settles into a steady state .",
    "then the disk mass - loss rate , as the stellar mass - loss rate , depends on the eddington number while velocity depends on the effective luminosity at the critical point .      in the stellar case for @xmath22 ,",
    "the analytic solutions provide scaling of the wind properties on all model parameters .",
    "for example , the @xmath38 parameter determines a slope of the power - law dependence of @xmath9 on luminosity and on @xmath39 ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) .",
    "( 170,400 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    for @xmath41 in the @xmath10 case , @xmath38 and @xmath39 determine the slope of a _ linear _ dependence of @xmath9 on luminosity : @xmath42 .",
    "additionally , @xmath38 enters the expression for @xmath20 and then determines the lowest value of @xmath33 for which @xmath22 and the power - law applies ( see equation 5 ) .",
    "moreover , through @xmath43 the @xmath38 parameter defines the lower limit of @xmath33 for which a wind solution exists ( see equation 6 ) .",
    "fig .  2 illustrates how the mass - loss rate depends on the eddington number for various @xmath38 with ( a ) @xmath44 and ( b ) @xmath39 rescaled with @xmath38 ( see below ) .",
    "fig .  2 also compares our predictions for @xmath9 and @xmath3 .",
    "we do not consider the @xmath45 case with @xmath46 and 0.8 because our calculations for @xmath47 are sufficient to show the basic behavior in this case .    in the disc case , we used psd s results complemented by our results .",
    "psd calculated a few disc wind models with @xmath46 , 0.6 and 0.8 for various disc and stellar luminosities in the @xmath6 case .",
    "they found that there is no change in the power - law dependence of @xmath3 on luminosity between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , in contrast to scaling found for the stellar wind solutions .",
    "the analysis in previous subsection showed that @xmath3 scales with the eddington number for @xmath47 almost as @xmath9 .",
    "however the analysis also showed that the cak scaling does not apply in both the disc and stellar cases if @xmath33 is very low and a finite @xmath5 is used . using these conclusions about similarities between disc and stellar winds , a simple interpretation of the psd results for @xmath48",
    "is that for these disc models @xmath21 and the power - law does not apply . as we mentioned above , @xmath20 increases with @xmath38 ( equation a17 ) and subsequently the lowest @xmath33",
    "for which the power - law applies , increases to unity with @xmath38 , ( equation 1 ) .",
    "then for a fairly high @xmath48 , even the highest - considered @xmath33 in fig .  2 might still be in the region where the power - law does not apply in the disc @xmath6 case .",
    "if so , no change in the power - law found by psd and confirmed here can be seen as cancellation of the two opposite trends 1 ) a decrease of the slope caused by higher @xmath38 and 2 ) an increase of the slope caused by a finite @xmath5 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by the results for disc winds with @xmath46 .",
    "2 shows that for @xmath46 , the slope is as predicted by the cak&fd scaling and the power - law applies for a eddington number range wider than for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    in their preliminary parameter survey , psd calculated disc wind models for different @xmath38 and @xmath19 while holding @xmath5 and @xmath39 fixed . in their formalism , they did that by means of adjusting a value of @xmath23 according to the equation @xmath49 as we mentioned in section 3.1 gayley ( 1995 ) showed that @xmath5 can be interpreted as a pseudo - conserved quantity that is proportional to metallicity and is estimable a priori .",
    "however @xmath39 depends on metallicity , sound speed and the other force multiplier parameters ( e.g. , cak , gayley 1995 ) . assuming that @xmath5 is constant and using equation ( 4 ) we can express @xmath39 as @xmath50 additionally adopting gayley s working assumption that we truncate the line distribution at the single strongest line ( i.e. , @xmath51 using our notation ) we can rewrite equation ( 9 ) as @xmath52 the last equation shows explicitly how the formal parameter @xmath39 depends on physical properties of wind .    in this context",
    "we could ask how psd s and our results for fixed @xmath39 and @xmath5 can be rescaled to accommodate the coupling of @xmath39 with other model parameters .    using the result for stellar winds : @xmath53 , we can rescale the mass - loss rates for a new k parameter , @xmath54 if we multiply @xmath2 by the correction factor : @xmath55    the detailed calculations of the force multiplier and stellar winds ( e.g. , cak ; abbott 1982 ; gayley 1995 ) showed that the mass - loss rate increases with decreasing @xmath38 .",
    "this result can be understood if we consider the coupling between the parameters of the force multiplier .",
    "as equation ( 9 ) shows , @xmath39 increases with decreasing @xmath38 causing an overall increase of @xmath56 and subsequently an increase of @xmath2 .",
    "psd s results suggest that @xmath9 increases with @xmath38 .",
    "this result is the consequence of changing @xmath38 but formally keeping @xmath39 constant .",
    "we found a similar behaviour of @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "2a ) when we applied psd s approach .",
    "however our previous analysis and numerical tests show that we can rescale @xmath3 if other @xmath39 is chosen .",
    "for example , if we take psd models for @xmath46 and 0.8 and want to rescale them , keeping @xmath5 and @xmath23 as for @xmath47 ( i.e. , @xmath18 and @xmath57 ) we need first calculate @xmath54 using equation ( 9 ) and then use the correction factor @xmath58 . in the example considered here",
    "the correction factor is : @xmath59 fig .",
    "2b shows results from fig .  2a , where the mass - loss rates for @xmath46 and 0.8 are rescaled as described .",
    "the results for @xmath47 are unchanged .",
    "2a clearly shows that after rescaling @xmath3 and @xmath9 increase with decreasing @xmath38 as found in previous stellar wind models .",
    "contrary to the mass - loss rate , the terminal velocity does not depend on k ( e.g. , equations a13 , a22 , and a25 ) .",
    "our numerical tests confirm this for stellar and disk winds .",
    "analytic steady state solutions of stellar winds depend very weakly on the sound speed ( e.g. , cak ; ppk )",
    ". numerical simulations of stellar winds showed that a higher @xmath60 shortens the computational time needed for the initial conditions to settle into a steady state ( e.g. , ocr ) . however",
    "the final steady state solution does not depend on @xmath60 .",
    "our numerical tests confirm these results for stellar winds .",
    "we thus do not expect changes of our disc wind results with @xmath60 either .",
    "nevertheless we calculated a few models for various @xmath60 .",
    "we have calculated models with @xmath61 higher and lower than @xmath62 by a factor of 3 and compare them with psd s fiducial complex and steady models , psd s model 2 and 8 respectively .",
    "we found that @xmath3 and velocity of the disc winds do not depend on @xmath63 .",
    "however , the time behaviour of the winds does depend .",
    "for example , the psd fiducial steady state model recalculated with @xmath64 is somewhat time dependent : density fluctuations originating in the wind base spread in the form of streams sweeping outward .",
    "we did not find infalls of dense clumps of gas on the disc . on the other hand , the model as the psd fiducial complex model but with @xmath65 settles into much smoother and steadier state than psd s model 2 .",
    "generally , we found that wind time dependence weakens with increasing @xmath63 because the gas pressure effects get stronger with increasing @xmath63 .",
    "subsequently higher gas pressure smooths the flow more effectively and in a larger region above the disc mid - plane as the size of the subcritical part of the flow increases with @xmath61 .",
    "our comparison between disc and stellar winds has shown that despite differences in geometry , these two winds are similar in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath11 . in particular , we showed that @xmath9 is an upper limit on @xmath3 for the same model parameters , typically @xmath66 .",
    "previous cv wind simulations showed that the predicted @xmath3 is lower than the observed @xmath3 by a factor of a few , at best ( e.g. , drew 1997 , psd and references therein ) .",
    "if we use @xmath9 for the eddington number and other model parameters as for cv s accretion discs we still may not reproduce observed disc mass - loss rates .",
    "thus we might conclude that 1 ) present disc wind models still need some important improvement or 2 ) @xmath3 inferred from observations are overestimated , or both . at the moment redetermination of @xmath3 from observations taking into account wind structure predicted by psd",
    "is probably better than moving directly to exploring different ways of enhancing theoretical @xmath3 ( e.g. , including magnetic field effects ) .",
    "such an approach will provide better constraints on our disk wind model .",
    "our tests with different sound speeds showed that thermodynamic effects might be important in determining time behavior of the disc winds .",
    "however we do not believe that a sound speed higher by a factor of 3 compared to the one used psd for cvs is possible because this could correspond to the wind temperature higher by a factor of 9 !",
    "thus we do not expect great changes in models for cv disc winds after the inclusion of temperature calculations .",
    "thermodynamics and changes in wind photoionization might be important in very luminous systems such as agns and x - ray binaries . in studies of the former",
    "there is the long standing problem of wind over - ionization by the central radiation , especially in the inner part of an outflow .",
    "such over - ionization will manifest in a low @xmath5 , for instance .",
    "however it is arguable how damaging for radiation driving that can be . using fiducial values for agn s : @xmath67 and @xmath47 ( e.g. , murray et al .",
    "1995 ; arav 1996 ) and equation ( a19 ) , @xmath68 .",
    "our analysis showed that line driven winds are strong and fast when @xmath69 .",
    "thus for agns to produce strong and fast line - driven winds not too many absorption lines are needed .",
    "stevens & kallman ( 1990 ) showed that @xmath70 for relatively high photoionization parameters ( see also arav , li & begelman 1994 ; murray  et  al .",
    "this simple argument supports the idea that winds in agns are line - driven .    to conclude we would like to mention that previous attempts to model disc winds using 1d approximations , have found some vindication in our fully 2d time - dependent simulations",
    "this is not surprising , because of the energy argument : in both the stellar and disc cases most of the radiation energy is released near the central object .",
    "thus the fully 2d calculations are crucial to determine the density and velocity as function of the position and time but less necessary to estimate the mass - loss rate and typical velocity for disc winds .",

    "the radial radiation force ( per unit mass ) due to spectral lines at every location in the flow can be expressed as @xmath71 where the term in brackets is the radiation force due to electron scattering from a stellar surface element and @xmath72 is the frequency integrated flux from that element .",

    "<S> we find that stellar and disc winds driven by radiation , within the cak framework , are very similar as far as mass - loss rates and velocities are concerned . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can use analytic results for stellar winds to rescale , in a first order approximation , numerical results for disc winds . </S>",
