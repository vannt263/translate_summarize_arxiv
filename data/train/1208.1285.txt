    "broadly speaking , there are two approaches that could help reproduce the observed co emission line wings : the first deals with adjusting the physical conditions of the model at small radii , and the second relies on modifying the model parameters that control the projected velocity field .    for the first ( structure )",

    "however , the required tempertaure profile is too steep to properly account for the emission morphology generated at relatively large disk radii , and therefore ends up being a very poor match for the co emission near the systemic velocity .",

    "no reasonable combinations of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath14 can simultaneously reproduce both the co line wings and the emission morphology near the systemic velocity . uniformly scaling up the temperature profile gradient or projected velocity field at all disk radii",
    "can not explain the patterns of the alma data .",
    "the standard modeling formalism explored in  3.2 is unable to explain the observed spatio - kinematic emission morphologies of the co emission lines generated by the tw hya disk .",
    "however , that modeling effort demonstrated clearly the  sense \" of this failure . to produce the emission line wings , we need a model with either much higher temperatures or increased projected velocities in the inner disk .",
    "however , the observed emission morphology near the systemic velocity was explained best with a fiducial temperature structure and projected velocity field .",
    "this implies that we require a deviation from the standard structure and kinematics model that _ varies with radius _ in the disk . as before ,",
    "these modifications to @xmath69 or @xmath70 can be manifested in a deviation to the form of the temperature profile , the intrinsic disk velocity field , @xmath71 , and/or the disk viewing angle , @xmath72 , so long as those functional forms _ decrease _ with @xmath9 .",
    "three such alternatives were explored here , using simple parametric adjustments to the standard model prescription .",
    "the first approach we adopted for these alternative models was to implement a structural modification to the radial temperature profile .",
    "as was shown in  3.2 , models with a hot inner disk ( steeper gradient @xmath54 ) are able to reproduce the observed co line wing intensities , but the outer disk needs to have a more shallow temperature profile to account for the emission morphology near the line core . in principle",
    ", these features could be reconciled by permitting the gradient parameter @xmath54 to vary with radius .",
    "however , such a modification is not so intuitive ; instead , we elected to simply permit a multiplicative scaling of the temperatures inside a given radius , such that @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a free ( constant ) parameter in the inner disk , but @xmath75 when @xmath76 .",
    "in effect , this model adjustment preserves the fiducial outer disk temperature profile , but artificially scales up the temperatures at small disk radii to produce the co line wings .",
    "based on this modified framework , we developed a representative model for the co emission following the procedure described in  3.2 .",
    "the resulting parameters for this  hot \" model are listed in table [ tab : params1 ] .",
    "synthetic observations of the model are compared with the data as channel maps in figure [ fig : compare2 ] , as well as in position - velocity diagrams ( constructed from a slice along the disk major axis ) in figure [ fig : pv1 ] .",
    "we find a good match to the co data by modifying the fiducial model described in  3.2 with a scaling factor @xmath77 inside a radius @xmath78au .",
    "this choice for @xmath79 was not arbitrary ; it was selected because the tw hya disk is known to have substantially diminished dust optical depths inside that radius @xcite .",
    "notably , the implicit assumption for this scenario is that a substantial gas reservoir is still present inside the dust cavity .",
    "the second alternative we considered was a kinematic modification to the intrinsic velocity field of the gas in the inner disk .",
    "again , as demonstrated in  3.2 , the outer disk velocities can not also be scaled up without producing large deviations in the observed emission morphology near the systemic velocity . to accomodate both requirements",
    ", we introduced a simple scaling factor for the disk velocity field , @xmath80 ( see equation 5 ) .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath81 describes the model deviation from keplerian orbits and is permitted to vary with radius like a power - law in the inner disk , @xmath82 where \\{@xmath83 , @xmath84 } are free parameters that describe a break radius and the gradient of the scaling function , respectively . in the standard models described in  3.1 and 3.2 , @xmath85 at all disk radii ( effectively , @xmath86 in those cases ) . adding in this parametric non - keplerian scaling factor as a slight modification to the standard modeling framework , we constructed representative models for the co emission lines using the procedure outlined above .",
    "the resulting parameter values are listed in table [ tab : params1 ] ; the model is compared with the alma data in figures [ fig : compare2 ] and [ fig : pv1 ] .",
    "adopting @xmath87au and @xmath88 to describe @xmath81 , we were able to reproduce well the observed co line wings without sacrificing the fit quality of the emission morphology near the systemic velocity .",
    "the super - keplerian rotation in the inner disk means that the co emitting area at the observed velocities of the line wings is substantially enhanced relative to the fiducial model ( by a factor of @xmath195 ) , and therefore able to generate high - velocity emission at roughly the observed levels .",
    "the \\{@xmath83 , @xmath84 } values adopted here are not unique ( nor optimized ) ; a smaller break radius and larger gradient ( or vice versa ) could probably accomodate the data with a similar fit quality .",
    "however , these values and this _ kind _ of model modification are sufficient to demonstrate the key point : a non - keplerian deviation in the disk velocity field which decreases with radius successfully accounts for the observed spatio - kinematic co structure emitted by the tw hya disk .",
    "we explored another kinematic alternative model that incorporates a warp in the vertical structure of the gas disk .",
    "rather than raise the intrinsic orbital velocity of the gas ( @xmath67 ) , this model increases the observed velocity by changing the line of sight ( @xmath65 ) as a function of radius . in this way , a warp  or a disk inclination that _ increases _ toward the central star  raises the projected velocities in the inner disk , effectively increasing the emitting area at a given observed velocity .",
    "if the inclination is a decreasing function of @xmath9 , this model can be designed to have minimal impact on the kinematic pattern for the outer disk , promoting a favorable emission morphology near the systemic velocity . to construct a warped disk model",
    ", we introduced a power - law profile for the observed inclination angles , @xmath89 aligned with the disk major axis ( assuming a vertically thin disk ; see the appendix ) , where \\{@xmath90 , @xmath91 } are parameters that describe the inclination normalization ( at @xmath92 ) and its radial gradient , respectively . for a given set of structure parameters , the model densities and temperatures",
    "are rotated to this modified viewing geometry .",
    "the velocity field is tilted using a quaternion transformation , as described in more detail in the appendix . incorporating this parametric formulation for a warped disk viewing geometry , we constructed models for the tw hya co emission lines as before .",
    "the resulting parameter values for a representative warped model are included in table [ tab : params1 ] ; synthetic observations of the models are compared with the data in figures [ fig : compare2 ] and [ fig : pv1 ] .",
    "models that include a modest warp , with @xmath93 at @xmath94au and a gradient @xmath95 , provide an excellent match with the alma data for both co emission lines , reproducing well the observed line wings and emission morphology near the systemic velocity .",
    "like the non - keplerian model described in  3.3.2 , this warp formulation successfully produces high - velocity line emission by increasing the projected co emitting area at the observed wing velocities by a factor of @xmath195 ( by design ) . and",
    "also like that case , the warp model parameters we determine or even the formulation we adopt are not unique , nor optimized .",
    "instead , they are intended to conceptually verify that a warped disk geometry can reproduce in detail the fundamental features of the observed co line emission with the addition of only a single model parameter ; an inclination gradient , @xmath91 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the alternatives discussed in the previous subsections are in no way mutually exclusive : various combinations of these effects could be used to achieve similar results .",
    "moreover , there are additional alternatives to a simple disk model that could presumably account for these alma observations , but have not been explored in detail here .",
    "perhaps most compelling among these is a model that explicitly incorporates a spatial variation in the broadening term of the line profile .",
    "for example , it seems reasonable that a model with a turbulent line width @xmath56 that decreases with radius should be able to re - distribute some emission into the high - velocity line wings observed here .",
    "the @xmath56 values we adopted are commensurate with the turbulence constraints imposed by @xcite for the outer disk , made using observations with @xmath194 - 5@xmath23 higher spectral resolution than the alma data .",
    "however , we can not rule out higher @xmath56 values at small disk radii .",
    "we attempted a simple modification to our fiducial model that permits the turbulent velocity widths to scale with the sound speed of the gas , using the @xcite upper limit to normalize @xmath96 in the outer disk : but given the low @xmath56 at large @xmath9 and modest radial variation of @xmath43 , this has little effect on the co line wings .",
    "if a variable turbulent line width parameter is the origin of these wings , @xmath56 must increase more steeply than @xmath43 in the inner disk . given the limited velocity resolution of these alma data relative to the subsonic turbulent velocity dispersions in the tw hya disk",
    ", we felt it was premature to push the further exploration of such models .",
    "nevertheless , it remains an interesting possibility that could be investigated with future observations .",
    "we have conducted a detailed analysis of the @xmath0co @xmath1=2@xmath21 and @xmath1=3@xmath22 line emission from the gas - rich disk around the nearby young star tw hya , making extensive use of the science verification data from the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) commissioning effort . with the substantial improvement in line sensitivity afforded by alma ( even during its construction ) , we identified a novel feature in these co spectra : the presence of relatively faint line wing emission extending out to high projected velocities of at least @xmath97 km s@xmath3 from the ( systemic ) line center , roughly twice the maximum velocities previously inferred for the tw hya disk from less sensitive data @xcite .",
    "given the nearly face - on viewing geometry of the tw hya disk , gas on keplerian orbits that generates these line wings must be located within a few au from the central star .",
    "this kinematic super - resolution was employed in an exploration of the temperature and velocity structure of the inner disk , utilizing a non - local thermodynamic equilibrium molecular excitation and radiative transfer code and a standard modeling prescription for circumstellar disks .",
    "we found that the typical assumptions of a simple , keplerian disk with a smooth gas temperature profile were unable to simultaneously produce both the co line wings and the observed line emission morphology near the systemic velocity .",
    "instead , we developed three alternative model possibilities that are able to qualitatively account for the alma data by making small ( parametric ) adjustments to the spatio - kinematic structure of the gas in the inner disk .",
    "in one such alternative , we considered a parametric scaling of the gas temperatures inside the known dust - depleted cavity at the disk center ( @xmath98au ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) in an effort to boost the co line wing intensities without substantially disturbing the emission morphology near the line core . with the outer disk structure based on a fiducial model ,",
    "an increase of the gas temperatures in the dust cavity by a factor of @xmath193 successfully accounts for the alma co observations .",
    "while such a temperature scaling might seem simplistic and artificial , it is in fact consistent with continuum radiative transfer models for the tw hya disk : the low optical depths inside the disk cavity mean that stellar radiation is effectively unattenuated , leading to substantial heating @xcite .",
    "if we assume that gas and dust temperatures are correlated ( if not identical ) , then the factor @xmath99 derived here is quite reasonable . for reference ,",
    "the models developed by @xcite have dust temperatures that increase by a factor of @xmath194 over a narrow ( @xmath191au - wide ) region around the cavity radius ( see their figure 3 ) .",
    "it is interesting to consider the key implication of this model : the co emission line wings detected by alma may offer an indirect ( and not very practical ) observational signature of a low - density dust cavity , but they also _ require _ that this cavity still hosts a significant reservoir of molecular gas .    of course , the presence of gas inside the tw hya disk cavity has been inferred from other diagnostics : accretion indicators @xcite , as well as emission lines of simple atoms and molecules @xcite , including co ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "moreover , our  hot \" model assumes enhanced temperatures over a continuous emitting area out to 4au : if a smaller area were adopted , the temperature scaling factor @xmath74 would have to be proportionately increased to compensate for the observed line wing intensities ( notably to uncomfortable levels that start to impinge on the thermal dissociation energy ) . given the uncertainties involved in analyzing both kinds of co data , it is not clear whether a  hot \" model derived from the rotational lines ( as in  3.3.1 ) is necessarily in conflict ( i.e. , too hot ) with the rovibrational spectrum . in any case",
    ", it is interesting to note that these two complementary methods could eventually be used to obtain independent constraints on the gas properties inside the tw hya dust disk cavity . in the near future",
    ", alma can provide sensitive high angular resolution images of these same co transitions that will resolve the spatio - kinematic morphology of their line wings .",
    "that information will be crucial for locating the co emitting area , enabling more direct comparisons between the infrared and millimeter - wave diagnostics .",
    "while the first model described above was devoted to modifications of the _ structure _ in the inner disk , the remaining two alternatives focused on adjustments to the disk _",
    "kinematics_. rather than increasing the intrinsic line intensities from a fixed emitting area , these other models produced the observed co line wings by increasing the effective emitting area itself .",
    "in one such scenario , we modified the intrinsic velocity field in the inner disk with a simple parametric deviation from keplerian orbits .",
    "we found in  3.3.2 that a model which incorporated super - keplerian rotation in the inner disk successfully reproduced the observed co line emission .",

    "if this deviation was restricted to much smaller disk radii only , the corresponding scaling factor @xmath81 would need to be substantially larger to account for the observed co line wings .",
    "admittedly , of the three alternative models explored here , this scenario is the least physically - motivated . while in principle a ( reverse ) pressure gradient could accelerate the disk material , most models that consider such gradients instead call for sub - keplerian motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "no such structural features have yet been identified for the tw hya disk ; but there are similar disks that do exhibit this kind of asymmetry @xcite .",
    "though these possibilities seem exotic , they remain in consideration until realistic , testable models for more complex disk velocity fields are developed .",
    "the final alternative model we developed to account for the alma co data also relied on modifying the _ observed _ disk velocity field , @xmath113 . in this scenario , we maintained the standard assumption of keplerian orbits ( @xmath16 ) and instead permitted the projection factor @xmath65 to vary with radius . in ",

    "the sinusoidal pattern of the azimuthal profile is a result of material in the inner disk  where the warp is enhanced ",

    "the phase of that pattern is set by the assumed warp ( rotation ) axis , which was arbitrarily aligned with the observed major axis of the disk projected on the sky ( 151  e of n ) .",
    "however , in practice the phase depends only relatively weakly on the warp axis orientation : shifting the latter by @xmath2520  leads to only modest changes to the pattern phase ( i.e. , the data are not quite able to quantify the warp orientation ) .",
    "the pattern amplitude depends more sensitively on the adopted model parameters , as it is set primarily by the height of the optically thick dust layer in the inner disk .",
    "if the inner disk were substantially cooler , and therefore had lower scale heights , the level of shadowing would decrease and the amplitude of the azimuthal scattering pattern would be diminished . indeed ,",
    "if we instead adopt the cooler , midplane dust temperatures found by @xcite to set the dust scale heights using equation 4 , we find a modest ( @xmath1920% ) decrease in the peak amplitudes that are more consistent with the scattered light data .",

    "if we were to assume no dust depletion in the disk cavity , the shadowing of the outer disk would be much more pronounced , with a normalized amplitude of @xmath191 in the azimuthal variation of scattered light .",
    "in essence , there is a substantial degeneracy between the spatial distribution of dust in the inner disk ( i.e. , the cavity size and depletion factor , as well as the local scale heights ) and the parameters that describe the warp . nevertheless , for a set of simple assumptions grounded in the alma co data ( and the dust cavity from the sed and resolved images ; * ?",

    "<S> we present a detailed analysis of the spatially and spectrally resolved @xmath0co @xmath1=2@xmath21 and @xmath1=3@xmath22 emission lines from the tw hya circumstellar disk , based on science verification data from the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) . </S>",
    "<S> these lines exhibit substantial emission in their high - velocity wings ( with projected velocities out to 2.1 km s@xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> corresponding to intrinsic orbital velocities @xmath420 km s@xmath3 ) that trace molecular gas as close as 2au from the central star . </S>",
    "<S> however , we are not able to reproduce the intensity of these wings and the general spatio - kinematic pattern of the lines with simple models for the disk structure and kinematics . using three - dimensional non - local thermodynamic equilibrium molecular excitation and radiative transfer calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we construct some alternative models that successfully account for these features by modifying either ( 1 ) the temperature structure of the inner disk ( inside the dust - depleted disk cavity ; @xmath5au ) ; ( 2 ) the intrinsic ( keplerian ) disk velocity field ; or ( 3 ) the distribution of disk inclination angles ( a warp ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter approach is particularly compelling because a representative warped disk model qualitatively reproduces the observed azimuthal modulation of optical light scattered off the disk surface . in any model scenario </S>",
    "<S> , the alma data clearly require a substantial molecular gas reservoir located inside the region where dust optical depths are known to be substantially diminished in the tw hya disk , in agreement with previous studies based on infrared spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the results from these updated model prescriptions are discussed in terms of their potential physical origins , which might include dynamical perturbations from a low - mass companion with an orbital separation of a few au . </S>"
