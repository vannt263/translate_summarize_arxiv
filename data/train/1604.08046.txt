    "type iib supernovae ( sn  iib ) are thought to arise from the core - collapse of massive ( @xmath9 8 @xmath5 ) stars that lost most , but not all , of their thick h envelopes prior to explosion .",
    "this explains the special spectral evolution characteristic of the iib subtype .",
    "the most conspicuous features are h balmer lines that are strong around maximum light but weaken relatively quickly after that and he lines that become strong after the maximum .",
    "this makes sn iib members of an intermediate group between type ii and the hydrogen - poor , stripped envelope type ib / c explosions .",
    "the first identified case of the subtype was sn  1987k @xcite , while the best known member of the group is one of the closest and brightest sn of recent decades , sn  1993j ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "while sn  iib constitute approximately 10 - 12% of all core - collapse sne @xcite , detailed analyses have been published only on about a dozen of them . as from every type of supernovae ,",
    "one of the main questions is the nature of the progenitor stars .",
    "direct identification of the progenitor has been possible only in four cases : sn  1993j ( a k - type supergiant with initial mass @xmath1013 - 22 @xmath5 , which may be a component of an interacting binary system , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sn  2008ax ( a wolf - rayet star with @xmath1010 - 28 @xmath5 , probably exploded in a binary system , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sn  2011dh ( a yellow supergiant with @xmath1012 - 15 @xmath5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and sn  2013df ( see details later ) .",
    "in other cases , analysis of early light curves and/or the interactions with the circumstellar matter ( csm ) originating from pre - explosion mass - loss processes offer a chance to constrain the exploding star .",
    "spectral analysis of light echoes showed that cassiopeia a ( hereafter cas a ) was also a type iib explosion @xcite .",
    "the detailed study of this object can provide valuable pieces of information about the explosion mechanism of sn iib , which are difficult to extract from studying of the early supernova phases .",
    "such an interesting result was the confirmation of the asymmetric explosion of cas a @xcite .",
    "based on the observational characteristics , sn iib may be divided into two subgroups @xcite .",
    "sn  1993j and some similar explosions , e.g. sne  2011hs @xcite and 2013fu @xcite , are thought have arisen from massive stars with extended h envelopes ( @xmath11 10@xmath12 cm or some hundreds of solar radii ) .",
    "other sn  iib seem to have much more compact ( @xmath11 10@xmath13 cm , @xmath0 1 - 2 @xmath14 ) progenitors , e.g. sn  2008ax , sn  2003bg or sn  2001ig .",
    "members of these two subgroups are sometimes called sn  eiib ( extended iib ) and sn  ciib ( compact iib ) , respectively . nevertheless , the classification of sn  2011dh was ambiguous at first .",
    "while it was classified as a ciib based on its early - time luminosity and radio emission @xcite , later studies  based on the modeling of the bolometric light curve @xcite , on comparative multiwavelength studies @xcite , and on study of late - time x - ray data @xcite  strengthen the interpretation as an intermediate case ( @xmath15 a few tens of @xmath14 ) in agreement with the results of the direct progenitor identification ( see above ) .",
    "this case illustrates that there are several open questions concerning this sub - classification .",
    "moreover , there are other aspects which should be taken into account , e.g. the interpretation of early - time radio data ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or the possible asphericity of the explosions @xcite . nonetheless , as @xcite report , the amount of the early - time uv excess can be also a good indicator of the size of the progenitor ( although , as the authors also noted , the number of the studied sne is too low to draw a very general conclusion ) .",
    "the reality is likely to be complicated , because , based on theoretical and observational results , the progenitors of sn iib explosions may be members of interacting binary systems ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a well - known general characteristic of sn iib is the presence of double - peaked light curves in the whole optical range , which was first observed in the case of sn  1993j .",
    "the rapid decline after the initial peak is interpreted as adiabatic cooling of the `` fireball '' after the sn shock has broken out through the star s surface ; the timescale of the cooling depends mainly on the radius of the progenitor ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result of thermalization of @xmath16-rays and positrons originating from the radioactive decay of @xmath17ni and @xmath17co , the light curves reach a secondary maximum .",
    "the length of the initial declining phase is usually some days , so the fireball phase is not easy to detect ( see section [ lc_lc ] ) . up to now",
    ", detailed analyses have been published on only a few sn iib observed from the very early phases .",
    "thus , it is important to study well - observed individual objects as thoroughly as possible .",
    "sn  2013df is a recently discovered , nearby sn  iib .",
    "this object , located 32@xmath18 east and 14@xmath18 south from the center of the spiral galaxy ngc  4414 , was discovered on june 8 , 2013 @xcite .",
    "the first spectrum , obtained by @xcite , showed clear resemblance to the early spectra of sn  1993j , which suggested that sn  2013df was a sn iib .",
    "this suspicion was verified by @xcite ( hereafter vd14 ) , who presented early photometric and spectroscopic data and reached conclusions concerning the properties of the progenitor , identifying it as a yellow supergiant star with an estimated initial mass of @xmath1013 - 17 m@xmath19 , an effective temperature of @xmath204250 k , and an initial radius of @xmath21545 @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter mg14 ) presented a detailed analysis of early uv - optical light curves and some spectra , including nebular ones .",
    "their results concerning the progenitor are compatible with those of vd14 ( @xmath1012 - 13 m@xmath19 , @xmath22 64@xmath4169 @xmath14 ) .",
    "the common main conclusion of these authors is that sn  2013df is very similar to sn  1993j , and it was very probably the endpoint of a massive star with an extended but not massive h envelope .",
    "the similarity between sne 1993j and 2013df was strengthened by the work of @xcite ( hereafter ba15 ) based on the comparison of early uv - optical spectra of several sn iib .",
    "results based on late - time optical spectroscopy @xcite , as well as on early and late - time radio and x - ray observations @xcite , suggest the presence of csm interactions .",
    "this evidence indicates that the extended progenitors , as for sn  2013df , suffer from substantial mass loss some years before the explosion , which may be caused by the assumed binary companions of the exploding stars .    in this paper",
    ", we present some new results concerning the early and late - time properties of sn  2013df .",
    "first , we describe our ground - based spectroscopic and photometric observations in section [ obs ] .",
    "the method and results of modelling of spectra using a spectral synthesis code are shown in section [ spec ] . in section [ lc ] ,",
    "we present the steps of our analysis of the photometric data , including the comparative analysis of early light curves with those of other sn  iib , and the extraction of explosion parameters from early - time bolometric light curve modelling and from late - time light curve analysis . at the end of section [ lc ]",
    ", we also present our findings concerning the analysis of late - time mid - infrared data of sn  2013df .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] , we discuss our results and present our conclusions .",
    "during the reduction and analysis of our data , we used the adopted values of important parameters of sn  2013df and of its host galaxy , ngc  4414 .",
    "we adopted the explosion date @xmath23 = 2,456,447.8 @xmath24 0.5 jd , or june 4.3 ut ( determined by vd14 from the overall comparison of the sn 2013df light curves with those of sne 1993j and 2011dh ) to calculate the epochs of both spectroscopic and photometric measurements .",
    "we used the distance modulus of the host galaxy @xmath25= 31.10 @xmath24 0.05 mag ( @xmath26 = 16.6 @xmath24 0.4 mpc ) , established by @xcite based on their study of cepheid stars .",
    "this value was used also by vd14 .",
    "this distance modulus is definitely lower than the one used by mg14 ( @xmath25= 31.65 @xmath24 0.30 mag ) , which results in significant differences in the calculated bolometric magnitudes and luminosities of the sn ( see section [ lc ] ) .",
    "( note that the value used by mg14 can not be the weighted mean value of distance moduli provided by the nasa / ipac extragalactic database , ned , as the authors refer to it ; the mean value of individually referenced moduli listed in ned is @xmath25= 31.23 @xmath24 0.54 mag ) .",
    "the lower value of the distance is also suggested by the published values of the redshift of the host , @xmath27 = 0.002388 ( given by ned , * ? ? ?",
