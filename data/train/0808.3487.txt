    "the electron diffraction methods , providing only the visual picture of melting of nanocrystals , allow one to relate the melting temperature to the particle size , but they give no information about energetic properties of a nanosystem . in order to get more insight into nature of melting of nanocrystals ,",
    "these methods are often combined with various nanocalorimetric techniques , thus providing a possibility of estimation of both the melting temperature and the latent heat of fusion of nanocrystals @xcite@xcite .",
    "early theoretical studies of thermodynamics of nanocrystals were focused on attempts to explain the strong size dependence of the melting temperature . in thermodynamic consideration of an equilibrium between solid and liquid phases ,",
    "an important role was ascribed to the surface of the nanoparticle @xcite .",
    "some phenomenological models of melting of free nanoparticles employed the effect of surface melting inherent in the most of solids . for example , the liquid - layer model @xcite postulates formation of a quasi - liquid layer at the surface of a nanocrystal at temperature below its melting point . among recent theoretical approaches to description of size - dependent melting of nanocrystals , we would like to mention the liquid - drop model @xcite taking into account reduction of the average cohesion energy of atoms of a nanoparticle with reduction of its size and using an earlier proposed relation between the melting temperature and the cohesion energy @xcite .",
    "recently it was reported that thermodynamic properties of nanocrystals , such as cohesion energy @xcite , debye temperature @xcite , activation energy of diffusion @xcite , vacancy formation energy @xcite etc .",
    "display also size dependence .",
    "these experimental facts point to size influence on statistical characteristics of atoms .",
    "a considerable advance in computational capacity made for the last decade has enabled first - principles simulation of dynamical behavior and energetic characteristics of systems consisting of more than @xmath0 atoms @xcite@xcite , i.e. nanocrystals in the so - called mesoscale regime .",
    "a comprehensive molecular dynamics studies of thermodynamics of nanosized systems was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite for spherical cu nanocrystals .",
    "the obtained results demonstrate that both melting temperature and the latent heat of fusion decrease smoothly as particle radius decreases . the analysis of energetic and structural properties of nanocrystals revealed existence of a rather thin surface layer where average potential energy and root - mean - square ( rms ) displacements of atoms are largely different from that of the core region .",
    "the rms displacements of atoms in the surface layer increase dramatically at temperature below the bulk melting point of the nanoparticle @xmath1 , indicating melting of this layer .",
    "the thickness of the surface layer is relatively small and almost independent of temperature .",
    "the rms displacements of bulklike atoms of the nanocrystal rise linearly with temperature , and melting of the inner region of the particle occurs when the lindemann criterion is fulfilled .",
    "therefore , the molecular dynamics analysis of thermodynamic properties of nanocrystals @xcite revealed that a nanosized particle should be regarded as a structurally and energetically heterogeneous system .    according to results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the behavior of the average potential energy of atoms of a nanocrystal exhibits essentially nonlinear rise near @xmath1 . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite for the bulk solids , such a behavior is attributed to evolution of anharmonic instability of the phonon system of the crystal which is directly related to the melting transition .    in this work",
    "we study size - dependent modification of the phonon spectrum of crystals and its influence on thermodynamic properties .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we restrict ourselves with the case of a nanocrystalline plate .",
    "we show that the vibrational spectrum of such a system is substantially discrete and size - dependent .",
    "the phonon spectrum determines the parameters of statistical distribution of atomic displacements of the crystal .",
    "thus , the average values of energetic properties of the crystal exhibit size dependence . in our opinion",
    ", this is an important mechanism responsible for depression of the melting point and variation of thermodynamic properties of free nanocrystals with decreasing of their size .",
    "it is necessary to note that influence of discreteness of the spectrum of eigenvalues on energetic characteristics of many - particle finite systems was considered previously for atomic nuclei @xcite and nanoparticles of degenerated semiconductors @xcite . in these studies",
    "it was demonstrated that corrections due to the discreteness of the spectrum are proportional to the inverse size .",
    "to examine size influence on thermodynamics of nanocrystals , we use a self - consistent statistical method @xcite developed to compute thermodynamic properties of simple solids .",
    "the method consists , first , in derivation of a binary distribution function of atomic coordinates and , second , in a variational procedure of computation of interatomic distance and effective parameters of quasi - elastic bonds between atoms of the crystal .",
    "it was shown that the phonon spectrum of the crystal determines parameters of the distribution function and , therefore , the average values of energetic characteristics of the crystal .",
    "therefore , this approach allows one to clarify how size - dependent modification of the phonon spectrum of a small crystal affects its thermodynamic properties .",
    "the method has been applied to description of thermal characteristics of the rare gas crystals ( rgc ) @xcite@xcite and some simple fcc metals @xcite . in the framework of this method we also computed the formation energy of a vacancy in the rgc as a function of temperature and demonstrated that approaching the melting point ( which is assumed to be directly related to the point of anharmonic instability ) is accompanied by dramatic reduction of the energy required to create structure defects of the lattice @xcite . as in our previous studies",
