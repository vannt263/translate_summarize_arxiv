    "in the theory of inverse magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) , the recovering of the magnetic permeability is based on the interaction of a tip with the stray field of a magnetic material .",
    "so far the inverse problem has been solved in magnetostatic considerations for different cases such as spherical@xcite , seminfinite@xcite and slab@xcite geometries . in order to measure the magnetostatic interaction force ,",
    "the direction of the mfm tip movement has been always assumed to be perpendicular to the surface of the sample .",
    "this vertical movement mode of the mfm entails a mathematical procedure based on the laplace transform inverse method ( lim)@xcite applied to experimental data .",
