    "in the paper , we examine @xmath19-smooth real functions which can be computed ( in some new but natural meaning which is rigorously defined below ) on finite automata , i.e. , on sequential machines that have only finite number of states .",
    "we show that all these functions are affine and , moreover , that they can be expressed as complex functions @xmath29 and thus can be ascribed ( also in some natural rigorous meaning ) to matter waves from quantum theory .",
    "a general problem of evaluation of real functions on abstract discrete machines naturally arose at the very moment the first digital computers had been invented .",
    "there are a number of various mathematical statements of the problem which depend both on specific mathematical model of a digital computer ( the abstract machine ) and on the representation of reals in some ` digital ' form .",
    "for instance , real number computations on turing machines constitute a core of theory of constructive reals and computable functions .",
    "the theory demonstrates intensive development for during more than half a century , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "sequential machines ( also known as mealy automata , or as finite - state letter - to - letter transducers ) are , speaking loosely , turing machines whose heads move only in one direction .",
    "sequential machines are therefore less power computers compared to general turing machines ; however , a number of real world phenomena and processes can be modelled by sequential machines since the latter can be considered as ( non - autonomous ) discrete dynamical systems .",
    "that is why the theory of functions computable by sequential machines , which constitutes a substantial part of automata theory , has numerous applications not only in mathematics itself ( e.g. , in real analysis , @xmath8-adic analysis , number theory , complexity theory , dynamics , etc . ) but also in computer science , physics , linguistics and in many other sciences , see e.g. monographs @xcite for details and references .",
    "the paper was motivated by empirical data obtained during a research project related to an applied problem which assumed intensive computer experiments with automata modelling of various cryptographic primitives used in stream ciphers , hash functions , etc .",
    "word transformations performed by the automata where visualised , namely , represented by points of the unit square @xmath30\\times[0,1]$ ] in real plane @xmath3 so that coordinates of the points relate numerical ( radix ) representations of input words to the numerical representations of corresponding output words .",
    "it was noticed that once the modelled system was finite - state , and once input words were taken sufficiently long , some linear structures ( looking like segments of straight lines and somewhat resembling pictures from a double - slit experiment in quantum physics , cf . figures [ fig : plot-16][fig : plot-17 ] and figure [ fig:2slit ] ) may appear in the graph , but more complicated structures like smooth curves of higher order had never been observed .",
    "a particular aim of the paper is to give mathematical explanation of the phenomenon and to characterize these linear structures .",
    "but during the research it became evident that the problem ( which actually is a question what smooth real functions can be modelled on finite automata ) has applications not only to cryptography ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 11 ) ) but also may be related to mathematical formalism of quantum theory . as a matter of fact , the latter relation ( which we believe does exist ) can be regarded as a yet another answer to the following question discussed by a.  khrennikov in a series of papers devoted to so - called prequantum classical statistical field theory , see e.g. @xcite : _ why mathematical formalism of quantum theory _ ( which is based on the theory of linear operators on hilbert spaces ) _ is essentially linear although a number of quantum phenomena demonstrate an extremely non - linear behavior ? _",
    "thus the goal of the paper is twofold :    * firstly , to characterize real functions which can be computed by finite automata ; and * secondly , to give ( using obtained description of the functions ) some mathematical reasoning why wave phenomena are inherent in quantum systems .",
    "the major part of the paper focuses on real functions which can be computed by finite automata while the said mathematical reasoning is considered in a closing section which contains a discussion of possible applications of mathematical results of the paper to quantum theory .",
    "we are not going to discuss cryptographic applications here ; they will be postponed to forthcoming papers .    in the paper , by a general automaton ( whose set of states is not necessarily finite ) we mean a machine which performs letter - by - letter transformations of words over input alphabet into words over output alphabet : once a letter is feeded to the automaton , the automaton updates its current state ( which initially is fixed and so is the same for all input words ) to the next one and produces corresponding output letter .",
    "both the next state and the output letter depend both on the current state and on the input letter .",
    "therefore each letter of output word depends _ only _ on those letters of input word which have already been feeded to the automaton .",
    "an input word is a finite sequence of letters ; the letters can naturally be ascribed to ` causes ' while letters of the corresponding output word can be regarded as  effects .",
    "` causality ' just means that effects depend only on causes that ` already have happened ' ; therefore an automaton is an adequate mathematical formalism for a specific manifestation of causality principle once we assume that there exist only finitely many causes and effects , cf .",
    ", e.g.,@xcite .",
    "when studying real functions that can be computed by an automaton @xmath0 whose input / output alphabets are @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is an integer from @xmath33 ) most authors follow common approach which described in e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter xiii , section 4 ) : they associate an infinite word @xmath34 over @xmath6 to a real number whose base-@xmath8 expansion is @xmath35 and consider a real function @xmath36 defined as follows : given @xmath37 $ ] , take its base-@xmath8 expansion @xmath38 ; then produce an infinite output sequence @xmath39 of @xmath0 by successfully feeding the automaton with the letters @xmath40 , @xmath41 , etc . , and put @xmath42 .",
    "being feeded by infinite input sequence @xmath34 , the automaton @xmath0 produces a unique infinite output sequence @xmath39 ; therefore the function @xmath36 is well defined everywhere on the real closed unit interval ( segment ) @xmath43 $ ] with the exception of maybe a countable set @xmath44 $ ] of points ; namely , of those having two distinct base-@xmath8 expansions @xmath45 .",
    "the point set @xmath46\\}$ ] can be considered as a graph of the real function @xmath36 specified by the automaton @xmath0 ( every time , before being feeded by the very first letter of each infinite input word the automaton @xmath0 is assumed to be in a fixed state @xmath47 , the _ initial state _ ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath48 is defined uniquely for @xmath49\\setminus d$ ] and @xmath48 can be ascribed to at most two values for @xmath50 ; so @xmath36 can be treated a real function which is defined on the unit segment @xmath14 $ ] and has not more that a countable number points of discontinuity in @xmath14 $ ] . in the sequel",
    "we refer @xmath51 as to the _ monna graph _ of the automaton @xmath0 , cf .",
    "subsection [ ssec : plots ] .    the said common approach ( and its various generalisations )",
    "is utilised in numerous papers , see e.g. @xcite . speaking loosely , the common approach looks as if one feeds the automaton @xmath0 by a base-@xmath8 expansion of a real number @xmath37 $ ] so that _ leftmost digits are feeded to the automaton prior to rightmost ones _ and observes output as real numbers since the automaton outputs accordingly leftmost digits of the base-@xmath8 expansion of @xmath52 $ ] prior to rightmost ones thus ascribing to the automaton @xmath11 the real function @xmath36 .",
    "we stress that the function @xmath36 is well defined almost everywhere on @xmath14 $ ] due to _ namely that order _ in which digits of base-@xmath8 expansion are feeded to ( and outputted from ) the automaton @xmath0 .",
    "a crucial difference of the approach used in our paper from the mentioned one is that _ the order we feed digits to ( and read digits from ) the automaton is inverse _ : namely ,    1 .   given a real number @xmath37 $ ] , we represent @xmath53 via base-@xmath8 expansion @xmath54 ( we take both expansions if @xmath53 has two distinct ones ) ; 2 .   from the base-@xmath8 expansion @xmath55 we derive corresponding sequence @xmath56 of words ; then 3 .   feeding the automaton @xmath11 successively by the words",
    "@xmath56 so that _ rightmost letters are feeded to @xmath0 prior to leftmost ones _ we obtain corresponding output word sequence @xmath57 ; 4 .   to the output sequence we put into a correspondence the sequence @xmath58 of rational numbers",
    "whose base-@xmath8 expansions are @xmath59 thus obtaining a point set @xmath60 in the real unit square @xmath30\\times[0,1]$ ] ; after that 5 .",
    "we consider the set @xmath61 of _ all _ cluster points of the sequence @xmath62 ; 6 .",
    "finally , we specify a",
    "_ real plot _ ( or , briefly , a plot ) of the automaton @xmath11 as a union @xmath63,y\\in\\mathcal f(x)}((x;y)\\cup{\\euscript}x(x))$ ] .    in other words",
    ", @xmath15 is a closure in the unit square @xmath64 of the union @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the _",
    "@xmath67-th layer _ of the plot @xmath15 .",
    "that is , the plot @xmath68 can be considered as a ` limit ' of the sequence of sets @xmath69 , the _",
    "approximate plots _ at word length @xmath70 , while @xmath71 ( see more formal definitions in subsection [ ssec : plots ] ) .",
    "note that according to automata 0 - 1 law ( cf .",
    "* proposition 11.15 ) and @xcite ) the plot @xmath15 of arbitrary automaton @xmath0 can be of two kinds only : either @xmath72 or @xmath21 is a ( lebesgue ) measure-0 closed subset of @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , if the number of states of the automaton @xmath0 is finite ( further in the paper these automata are referred to as _ finite _ ones ) , then the second case takes place .    we stress crucial advantage of real plots over monna graphs : in a contrast to the monna graph @xmath51 , a real plot @xmath21 is capable of showing true long - term behavior of automaton @xmath0 ( i.e. , when @xmath0 is feeded by sufficiently long words ) rather than a short - term behaviour displayed by the monna graph @xmath73 since due to the very construction of the real plot the higher order ( i.e. , the most significant ) digits of the real number represented by the output word are formed by the latest outputted letters of the output word whereas the construction of the monna graph assumes that the higher order digits are formed by the earliest outputted letters .",
    "this results in a drastically different appearances of the real plot and of the monna graph : real plot clearly demonstrates that corresponding automaton is ` ultimately linear ' ( that is , exhibits linear long - term behavior ) , cf .",
    "figures [ fig : plot-16][fig : plot ] ; whereas the monna graph is incapable to reveal this important feature of the automaton , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : monna ] .",
    "this is the main reason why in the paper we focus on real plots of automata rather than on their monna graphs .",
    "therefore when specifying a notion of computability of a real - valued function @xmath74 $ ] ( where @xmath75 $ ] ) on automata , at least two different approaches do exist : the first one is to speak of the case when the graph @xmath76 of the function @xmath77 lie completely in @xmath78 for some automaton @xmath0 while the second one is to consider the case when @xmath79 .",
    "papers @xcite mentioned above basically deal with the computability in the first meaning whereas our s paper deals with the computability of the second kind . note that classes of real functions which are computable on finite automata are different depending on the meaning : for instance ,",
    "the function @xmath80 ( where @xmath81 stands for the integral part of @xmath82 , i.e. , for the biggest integer not exceeding @xmath83 ) is not computable in the first meaning but is computable in the second one whilst the function @xmath84 is computable in the first meaning but is not computable in the second one .    to the best of our knowledge , our approach ( which is based on real plots rather than on monna graphs ) was originally used in @xcite and was never considered before by other authors .    in the sequel we refer real functions @xmath74 $ ] with domain @xmath75 $ ] as to _ finitely computable _ if there exists a finite automaton @xmath0 whose real plot contains the graph of the function @xmath85 ; i.e. , if @xmath86 . main result of our paper is theorem [ thm : main ] which characterizes all finitely computable @xmath19-functions @xmath85 defined on a sub - segment @xmath87 $ ] : the theorem yields that _ if a finitely computable function @xmath88 $ ] is twice differentiable and if its second derivative is continuous everywhere on @xmath89 then @xmath85 is necessarily affine of the form @xmath90 for suitable rational @xmath8-adic @xmath91 _ ( that is , for @xmath92 , @xmath93 which can be represented by irreducible fractions whose denominators are co - prime to @xmath8 ) .",
    "moreover , this is true in @xmath94-dimensional case as well ( theorem [ thm : main - mult ] ) .    in view of theorem [ thm : main ]",
    "it is noteworthy that despite the classes of functions computable on finite automata are different depending on the meaning the computability is understood , nonetheless if a function @xmath95{\\rightarrow}[0,1]$ ] is everywhere differentiable on @xmath96 and @xmath97 for some finite automaton @xmath11 with binary input / output alphabets then @xmath85 is necessarily affine , see @xcite . in @xcite it is shown that a similar assertion holds for multivariate continuously differentiable functions and arbitrary finite alphabets . therefore finite automata should be judged as rather ` weak computers ' in all meanings since only quite simple real functions can be evaluated on these devices . from this view , results of the current paper are some contribution to the theory of computable real functions .",
    "it is worth mentioning right now that actually our proof reveals a basic reason why smooth functions which can be represented by finite automata are necessarily affine : this is because _ squaring can not be performed by a finite automaton _ ; that is , an automaton which , being feeded by a base-@xmath8 expansion of @xmath94 , outputs a base-@xmath8 expansion of @xmath98 for every positive integer @xmath94 , can not be finite ( the latter is a well - known fact from automata theory , see e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.2.3 ) ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the question when @xmath99 is somewhat easier to handle than the question when @xmath79 .",
    "indeed , in the first case once the automaton @xmath0 is feeded by an infinite word @xmath100 , the word is treated as a base-@xmath8 expansion of a unique real number @xmath101 $ ] , corresponding output of @xmath0 is also an infinite word @xmath102 which also is treated as a base-@xmath8 expansion of a unique real number @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "this results in a unique point @xmath104 of the unit square @xmath105 in the first case ; whilst in the second case the automaton @xmath0 , being feeded by the infinite word @xmath100 , produces generally an infinite point set of a cardinality continuum : the set is a closure of the point set @xmath106 in @xmath64 . due to this reason during the proofs we have to use more complicated techniques from real analysis which in some cases we combine with methods of @xmath8-adic analysis .",
    "therefore some proofs are involved ; but to make general idea of a proof as transparent as possible in the sequel we explain it in loose terms when appropriate .",
    "last but not least : our approach reveals another important feature of smooth functions which can be computed on finite automata . from figure",
    "[ fig : plot ] it can be clearly observed that limit points of the plot constitute a torus winding if one converts a unit square into torus by gluing together opposite sides of the square .",
    "this is not occasional : our theorem [ thm : main ] yields that _ if the unit square @xmath64 is mapped onto a torus @xmath107 , the smooth curves from the plot become torus windings _ ; and these _ windings after being represented in cylindrical coordinates are described by complex - valued functions @xmath29 _ ( @xmath37 $ ] ) , see corollary [ cor : mult - add - compl ] .",
    "but in quantum theory the latter exponential functions are ascribed to matter waves ( cf . , de broglie waves ) ; therefore , since automata can be considered as models for discrete casual systems , the _ results of our paper give some mathematical evidence that matter waves are inherent in quantum systems merely due to causality principle and discreteness of matter _ ( quantization ) .",
    "we discuss these possible connections to physics in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "note that for not to overload the paper with extra calculations we consider only automata whose input and output alphabets consist of @xmath8 letters @xmath108 where @xmath32 is a prime number though our approach can be expanded to the case when @xmath8 is arbitrary integer greater than 1 ( and even to the case when @xmath8 is not necessarily an integer , see section [ sec : concl ] ) . for a prime @xmath8",
    ", we naturally associate when necessary letters of the alphabet @xmath108 to residues modulo @xmath8 , i.e. , to elements of a finite field @xmath18 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    * in section [ sec : prelm ] we recall basic definitions as well as some ( mostly known ) facts from combinatorics of words , from automata theory , from @xmath8-adic analysis , and from knot theory .",
    "also in this section we formally introduce the notion of real plot of automaton and examine its basic properties . * in section [ sec : aff ] we completely describe cluster points of real plots of finite autonomous automata and of finite affine automata : we show that the points constitute links of torus knots . * in section [ sec : fin - comp ]",
    "we prove numerous ( mostly technical ) results on finitely computable functions ; that is , on real functions whose graphs lie in plots of finite automata . loosely speaking ,",
    "in the section we ( rigorously ) develop techniques to examine real functions computed on finite automata as if the automata are feeded by base-@xmath8 expansions of real arguments of the functions so that less significant digits are feeded to automaton prior to more significant ones . *",
    "section [ sec : main ] contains main results of the paper : we prove that once a finitely computable function is @xmath19-smooth than it is affine and may be associated to a finite collection of complex - valued functions @xmath109 , @xmath110 for suitable rational numbers @xmath91 which are @xmath8-adic integers .",
    "we prove a multivariate version of the theorem as well . * in section [ sec : concl ] we discuss possible connections of the main results to informational interpretation of quantum theory .",
    "we argue that the results show that wave function is a mathematical consequence of two basic assumptions which are causality principle and discreteness of matter : we show that using @xmath111-expansions of real numbers ( where @xmath112 and @xmath113 is small ) rather than base-@xmath8 expansions for positive integer @xmath32 , main results of the paper imply that a quantum system may be considered as a finite automaton which calculates functions @xmath114 ; but the functions are approximately equal to @xmath115 when @xmath116 since @xmath117 is small and thus @xmath118 ; moreover , @xmath112 implies that both input and output alphabets of the automaton must be necessarily binary , i.e. , @xmath119 .",
    "therefore one may say that the automaton produces waves @xmath115 ( since variables @xmath120 may be regarded as ` position ' and ` time ' respectively ) from bits .",
    "this may serve a mathematical evidence in favour of j.  a.  wheeler s _ it from bit _ doctrine which suggests that all things physical ( ` its ' ) are information - theoretic in origin ( ` from bits ' ) , @xcite .",
    "technically the paper is a sort of interplay between real analysis and @xmath8-adic analysis ; but although real analysis is the tool we mostly use in proofs , in some important places we also use @xmath8-adic analysis to examine specific properties of automata maps since the maps actually are 1-lipschitz functions w.r.t .",
    "@xmath8-adic metric .",
    "this is why we first recall some facts about words over a finite alphabet , @xmath8-adic integers , and automata .",
    "an _ alphabet _ is just a finite non - empty set @xmath6 ; further in the paper usually @xmath121 .",
    "elements of @xmath6 elements are called _ symbols _ , or _ letters_. by the definition , a _ word of length @xmath94 over alphabet @xmath6 _ is a finite sequence ( stretching from right to left ) @xmath122 , where @xmath123 . the number @xmath94 is called the _ length _ of the word @xmath124 and is denoted via @xmath125 .",

    "every measurement is a sequence of interactions @xmath2268 of the measurement instrument with the system , and if the accuracy of the instrument is not better than @xmath2271 , then the result of a single measurement lies within the segment @xmath2272 $ ] . assuming that @xmath2273 we see that even if the system before every measurement has been prepared in a fixed state @xmath47 ( the initial state of the automaton ) during a single measurement the system @xmath327 will be exposed to a random sequences of impacts @xmath2274 which switches the system to a new state @xmath2275 ; so actually as a result of the measurement due to its limited accuracy we obtain an experimental point @xmath2276 where @xmath2277 is the output of the automaton @xmath2278 ( whose initial state is @xmath2275 ) feeded by the sequence @xmath2279 .",

    "figures [ fig : plot-16 ] , [ fig : plot-17 ] , and [ fig : plot ] . this may be judged as linearity of corresponding physical law and , what is even more important , the way experimental points are clustering on the unit square is very much alike to that of the points where electrons hit target screen in a double - slit experiment , cf .",

    "we are not going here to discuss further parallels of the computer experiments with automata and behaviour of quantum systems such as analogies between transition and ergodic states of automata and mixed and pure quantum states respectively , or probabilities of markov chain related to an automaton and probabilities in quantum systems , etc . : although we believe that the analogies are not external but reflect deep relations between quantum systems and automata , the issues are far from the subject of the paper and that s why the discussion is postponed to further relevant papers . here",
    "we briefly touch only an interesting analogy between smooth curves in plots of finite automata and matter waves of quantum theory .    by theorem [ thm : main ] , the smooth curves from the plot of a finite automaton @xmath0 can be described by families of complex - valued exponential functions of the form @xmath1818 , @xmath1819 , for suitable @xmath1781 , cf .",
    "corollary [ cor : mult - add - compl ] .",
    "the wave function of a particle is of the form @xmath2280 where @xmath4 is momentum , @xmath53 position , @xmath857 angular frequency , and @xmath247 is a complex amplitude . comparing the two expressions",
    "we see that @xmath373 may serve as a time for the automaton @xmath0 since multiplication by @xmath373 is a @xmath138-step shift of a base-@xmath8 expansion of a number . but can we someway associate it to physical time @xmath229 of quantum theory ? in what follows",
    "we argue that yes , there is a natural way to do this .",
    "let us forget for a moment that @xmath8 is a positive integer and suppose that @xmath2281 where @xmath2282 is a small real number ; then @xmath2283 and if @xmath117 is a small time interval which is out of accuracy of measurements ( e.g. , let @xmath117 be planck time which is approximately @xmath2284 s. ) .",
    "therefore the torus link @xmath1818 , @xmath1819 can be approximately described by @xmath2285 , @xmath2286 since it is reasonable to assume that @xmath2287 is just a time @xmath229 as @xmath117 is a small time interval , a time quantum , the planck time .",
    "but @xmath2288 is a wave function of a particle with momentum @xmath92 , angular frequency @xmath2289 and amplitude @xmath2290 .",
    "is this mathematically correct to substitute @xmath2291 for @xmath8 in our reasoning ?",
    "yes , this is correct ; but to explain why this is correct we need to recall a notion of _ @xmath111-expansion _ of real number .",
    "the @xmath111-expansions are radix expansions in non - integer bases ; they were first introduced more than half - century ago , see @xcite , and now @xmath111-expansions are a substantial part of dynamics , see e.g. survey @xcite . following @xcite , given @xmath2292 and @xmath2293 , @xmath2294 we call a sequence @xmath2295 over the alphabet @xmath2296 a",
    "_ @xmath111-expansion _ of @xmath53 once @xmath2297 for suitable @xmath2298 .",
    "note that sometimes the term @xmath111-expansion is used in a narrower meaning , when the ` digits ' @xmath2299 are obtained by the so - called ` greedy algorithm ' only , cf .",
    "* section 7.2 ) but this is not important at the moment : in what follows we just sketch the way how the results of current paper can be modified to handle the case of @xmath111-expansions rather than the case of base-@xmath8 expansions only .",
    "we leave details and rigorous proofs for further paper .    from the definition",
    "we see that the notion of @xmath111-expansion is a generalization of the notion of base-@xmath8 expansion : it is clear that for @xmath2300 the @xmath111-expansion of @xmath53 is just base-@xmath8 expansion of @xmath53 , and that is why both @xmath111-expansions and base-@xmath8 expansions share some common properties . for instance , given @xmath111-expansion of reals it is possible to perform arithmetic operations with reals in a way similar to that of school - textbook algorithms for base-@xmath8 expansions of reals .",
    "however , differences between base-@xmath8 expansions and @xmath111-expansions should also be taken into the account since when @xmath111 is not an integer , a @xmath111-expansion of a real number is generally not unique ; moreover a real number may have a continuum of different @xmath111-expansions for @xmath111 fixed .",
    "nonetheless , we can perform arithmetic operations with numbers represented by @xmath111-expansions , i.e. , with words over the alphabet @xmath2301 . these operations for some non - integer @xmath111",
    "may be represented by finite automata as well .",
    "for instance , if @xmath23022 $ ] then arithmetic operations with numbers represented by @xmath23032$]-expansions @xmath153 and @xmath648 ( which are binary words over the alphabet @xmath119 since @xmath23042\\rfloor=1 $ ] ) can be performed in a manner similar to that when one applies school - textbook algorithms for base-@xmath8 expansions , with the only difference : a ` carry ' from @xmath67-th position should be added to @xmath2305-th position ; e.g. for @xmath2306 we have that @xmath2307 while in the case @xmath2308 we have that @xmath2309 . note that @xmath2310 , @xmath2311 ( and thus @xmath2312 ) when @xmath2306 ; and @xmath2310 , @xmath2313 when @xmath2308 .",
    "when an automaton @xmath0 proceeds a word ( or , a corresponding system reacts to impacts ) it just evaluates step - by - step a @xmath8-adic 1-lipschitz function @xmath385 ( cf .",
    "subsection [ ssec : a - map ] ) , and no @xmath111 appears at this moment .",
    "but we need to specify @xmath111 when we ` visualize ' the function @xmath386 in @xmath3 : to every word @xmath2314 over the alphabet @xmath1 we put into the correspondence a point @xmath2315 ; thus to every pair of input / output words of the automaton there corresponds a point in the unit square @xmath64(or , on the unit torus @xmath2316 ) .",
    "we then take a closure of all these points and obtain a _",
    "@xmath111-plot _ of the automaton @xmath0 in a way similar to that when we constructed a plot of the automaton ( which corresponds to the case when @xmath2300 ) , cf .",
    "definition [ def : plot - auto ] .",
    "we then consider smooth curves in the @xmath111-plots of finite automata , in particular , the curves which correspond to affine automata functions @xmath2317 . to these functions there correspond torus windings which can be expressed in a form of complex - valued functions @xmath2318 , @xmath2319 , @xmath249 ; and these functions can by approximated with arbitrarily high accuracy by functions @xmath2285 , @xmath2320 , just by taking @xmath2294 sufficiently close to 1 .",
    "moreover , the case when @xmath111 is close to 1 is the only case when approximations are of the form of wave functions . but",
    "this means that the _ corresponding automata must necessarily be binary _ ; i.e. , their input / output alphabets are @xmath2321 .",
    "so these automata ( which are just models of causal discrete systems ) indeed produce waves , the _ its _ , _ from bits_.    from this view , main results of the current paper may be considered as a contribution to informational interpretation of quantum theory , namely , to j.  a.  wheeler s _ it from bit _ doctrine which suggests that all things physical ( ` its ' ) are information - theoretic in origin ( ` from bits ' ) , @xcite : we have given some evidence above that this is indeed so regarding particular ` its ' , the matter waves .",
    "we stress once again that our conclusion is based on the following assumptions only : a quantum system is causal and discrete , whence is an automaton ; and the number of states of the automaton is finite .",
