    "the quantum tunneling in the double - well potential , @xmath0 , is a longstanding and well - known problem in quantum mechanics .",
    "one of the main interests in this problem is how accurately one can calculate the energy splitting of degenerate energy levels due to quantum tunneling .",
    "the nonperturbative nature of the double - well potential , which stems from the quartic term , does not allow standard perturbation treatment .",
    "instead several alternative methods have been proposed . among those",
    "there are the instanton method @xcite , the wkb approximation @xcite , and a numerical method @xcite .    in the instanton method",
    ", one uses imaginary time path integral to obtain the classical action - the so - called euclidean action .",
    "qualitatively , this method is useful in understanding the quantum tunneling which has no classical correspondence .",
    "however , the quantitative calculation of the energy splitting in the double - well potential by this method is inaccurate because the euclidean propagator can be obtained only in the limit of infinite separation between the two potential minima @xcite , which corresponds to zero tunneling probability .",
    "thus , the validity of the instanton approach is restricted to the case of which the two potential minima are far apart , and its accuracy is expected to be reduced as they become close .    in the case of wkb method , one uses the semiclassical approximation in which the de broglie wavelength @xmath1 is assumed to be very short and varies sufficiently slowly .",
    "the main defect of this approximation comes from the inevitable difficulties in treating the divergence of @xmath2 at a classical turning point .",
    "recently , a phase loss approach has been proposed to improve this shortcoming for general barrier potentials @xcite . in the usual wkb approximation , based on the short wavelength condition , the phase change of the wkb wave function at a classical turning point",
    "is taken to be @xmath3 .",
    "however , since the wavelength should not be arbitrarily short , the phase change should become a nonintegral multiple of @xmath3 . based on this idea",
    "the authors of ref.5 have shown that the accuracy of the wkb wave function is greatly improved .    in this paper",
    "we use this phase loss approach to calculate the wkb energy splitting in the double - well potential .",
    "although the authors of ref.5 applied this approach to several barrier potentials , the double - well potential , which is one of the prototypes in tunneling problem , was not treated .",
    "in addition to this we also consider the anharmonicity effect of the double - well potential . in most previous works @xcite the energy eigenvalue of a unperturbed harmonic oscillator",
    "has been used for the calculation of the energy splitting , which corresponds to the case of the infinite separation of the two potential minima , and hence exposes same defect as the instanton method .",
    "the present work , however , incorporates anharmonicity into the wkb formalism , which gives a more realistic model , and consequently a more improved result in the region over which the tunneling is appreciable . by using the phase loss approach with the anharmonicity effect we will present a general wkb energy splitting formula in a double - well potential . from this",
    ", the usual wkb energy splitting formula can be obtained by both taking short wavelength limit and using energy level corresponding to the infinite separation of the potential minima .",
    "also , if we take the short wavelength limit only we can derive an anharmonic wkb energy splitting formula .",
    "we then present comparisons between numerical results obtained from these formula ; for completeness , we also include results from the instanton method .",
    "we find that a bare application of the phase loss approach to the usual wkb method leads to better results only in the limits of large separation .",
    "if we consider the anharmonicity effect , however , the phase loss approach greatly improves the accuracy of the usual wkb approximation , especially in the region where the tunneling is appreciable . in the following section",
    ", we will first derive a general wkb energy splitting formula . in section iii",
    ", we will show comparisons between results of various cases and give discussions .",
    "finally , there will be a summary in section iv .",
    "we consider a double - well potential of the type given in the introduction , which is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the hamiltonian for this potential is @xmath4 in which @xmath5 is the particle momentum , and we have taken the particle mass @xmath6 .",
    "we will also take @xmath7 throughout this paper . in the wkb approximation we have phase integrals in the two classically allowed regions : @xmath8 and inside the central barrier we also have @xmath9 where @xmath10 with @xmath11 being an energy level in one of the wells .",
    "when we include the anharmonicity effect this energy level becomes , to second order correction , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy level of a unperturbed harmonic oscillator and @xmath14 is the second order correction term given as @xmath15 to obtain the wkb energy splitting formula in the double - well potential we follow the same method as described in ref.7 except using arbitrary phase losses @xmath16 at each turning point instead of @xmath3 which corresponds to the short wavelength limit .",
    "after long but straightforward calculations we obtain @xmath17 where @xmath18 to find the phase losses at the turning points we modify the matching condition suggested in ref.5 .",
    "since each well is asymmetric the phase changes at @xmath19 and @xmath20 are different . at @xmath21",
    "the phase losses are given by @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 the phase losses @xmath25 at @xmath26 can be obtained from the following algebraic equation : @xmath27 in this case the lippmann - schwinger equations should be written by @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the wkb wavefunctions inside the central barrier , in the right well , and in the right - barrier , respectively . by applying the wkb connection formula at each turning point we can obtain @xmath30 \\sin 2a ~ e^{-\\int_{\\gamma}^{x } \\kappa_n ( x')dx ' } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 we note that eq.(8 ) is a general wkb energy splitting formula with both anharmonicity effect and phase loss . in this formula ,",
    "if we use the unperturbed energy level @xmath32 we have the wkb formula with phase loss only : @xmath33 where @xmath34 with @xmath35 also , if we let @xmath36 in eq.(8 ) , it reduces to @xmath37 which corresponds to the case of the wkb approximation with anharmonicity effect only . finally , by both taking @xmath36 and using eq.(20 ) the usual wkb energy splitting formula can be obtained to be @xmath38",
    "to examine whether and how much the general wkb energy splitting formula improves the wkb approximation we calculate the various energy splittings derived in the previous section numerically and compare each numerical result with the exact values obtained by the nonperturbative method [ 4 ] . for completeness , we also include numerical results from the instanton method by which the energy splitting is obtained to be [ 2 ] @xmath39^ { \\frac{1}{2 } } e^{- \\frac{k \\sqrt{2k}}{3\\lambda } } .\\ ] ] the numerical calculations have been performed for @xmath40 ( the ground state ) case with @xmath41 , and we find @xmath42 s for different @xmath43 s ; the @xmath44 case does not give enough values for comparisons .",
    "for direct comparisons , we compute the ratios of each numerical result and the exact value taken from ref.4 , then find the respective differences of the ratios from 1 .",
    "the final results are listed in table 1 .",
    "an immediate observation from this table is , as remarked in the introduction , that both the instanton ( the fifth column ) and the usual wkb ( the first column ) methods give good estimate only for small values of @xmath43 which correspond to the limiting case of infinite separation of the two potential minima , and their results are getting worse as @xmath43 increases @xcite .",
    "it is also clear that the usual wkb approximation is better than the instanton method , which is consistent with the result of previous work [ 4 ] .    for the presence of tunneling in the double - well potential",
    "should the separation between the two potential minima be neither too small nor infinitely large . when the two minima are too close the height of the barrier becomes lower than the lowest energy level in each well .",
    "this can be seen from the first four columns where energy splittings for @xmath45 do not appear . in the opposite limit of @xmath46",
    "the two potential wells become two independent harmonic oscillator potentials , which does not allow tunneling . in order for",
    "the tunneling probability not to vanish the two potential wells should not be infinitely apart , which requires the consideration of the anharmonicity effect in calculating the energy splittings . from eq.(5 ) and eq.(7 ) this effect is seen to be little for small values of @xmath43 .",
    "the calculation of the energy splitting due to tunneling in this region is , then , governed by the usual wkb formula .",
    "as @xmath43 increases , however , the two wells approach each other , and the anharmonicity effect become more important .",
    "especially , for an appreciable tunneling probabiliy the anharmonic property of the double - well potential should be incorporated in the calculation of the energy splitting .",
    "thus , the result from the wkb formula with anharmonicity effect is expected to be improved as @xmath43 increases .",
    "we can see this behavior from the comparisons of the first column and the third one ( the wkb result with anharmonicity only ) . for @xmath47",
    "the usual wkb results are more accurate than that with anharmonicity effect .",
    "but , for @xmath48 the results from the wkb formula with anharmonicity effect are much more accurate than the usual wkb result .",
    "note that for @xmath49 the error of the anharmonic result is less than @xmath50 , while that of the usual wkb result has almost @xmath51 .",
    "this illuminates that the usual wkb approximation becomes unreliable for small separation distance .",
    "we now compare the first column with the second one . for small values of @xmath52 , the phase loss approach is better than the usual wkb estimate . for @xmath53 , however , the result from the phase loss is more inaccurate than the usual wkb result . by comparing the third column with the forth one",
    "we also find that the results from the general energy splitting formula which includes both the phase loss and the anharmonicity effect is slightly better than those from the wkb method with anharmonicity effect only . according to ref.5 the calculation of phase loss at turning point",
    "is based on the assumption that the wkb wavefunction inside a well is proportional to the exact wavefunction which can be obtained from schrdinger equation around the potential minimum .",
    "the condition for the validity of this approximation is that the dimensionless parameter @xmath54 , where @xmath55 being the distance between the point of potential minimum and the turning point , should be small . in the case of usual wkb method , while @xmath55 increases with @xmath43 , @xmath56 is independent of @xmath43 so that @xmath54 becomes larger with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the application of the phase loss approach to this case is expected to be valid only for small @xmath57 . on the other hand , when the anharmonicity effect is included , from eq.(11 ) @xmath58 decreases with @xmath43 .",
    "although the @xmath55 value in anharmonic case also increases with @xmath43 the dimensionless parameter @xmath54 remains small even for large values of @xmath43 .",
    "consequently , the incorporation of the anharmonicity effect in the wkb approximation makes the phase loss approach valid even for large values of @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the entries in the second and the forth columns are reasonable results .    finally , we discuss the occurence of a larger energy splitting in phase loss approach than in the usual ( or anharmonic ) wkb approximation .",
    "if we compare the first column ( or the third column ) with the second one ( or the forth one ) we can notice that the energy splitting @xmath59 ( or @xmath60 ) obtained by the phase loss approach is larger than @xmath61 ( or @xmath62 ) .",
    "the reason for this can be explained as follows . since the usual wkb approximation is based on the condition of short wavelength limit",
    "its formalsim is more particlelike .",
    "thus , in this semiclassical limit , the tunneling effect , which originates from pure wave property , is ill treated .",
    "however , in the phase loss approach we use the wkb method away from the short wavelength limit , and hence the approach is more wavelike . therefore , the phase loss approach treats the tunneling effect better , by which a larger energy splitting follows .",
    "we have investigated the phase loss approach in the wkb energy splitting formula about a double - well potential . by incorporating the phase loss approach with the anharmonicity effect in the usual wkb approximation we have obtained a general wkb energy splitting formula . a bare application of the phase loss to the usual wkb approximation yields a slight improvement only in the limits of large separation of the two potential minima .",
    "when the anharmonicity effect is included , however , the phase loss approach significantly improves the accuracy of the usual wkb method , especially in the range of appreciable tunneling .",
    "in applying the phase loss approach to the wkb approximation it is crucial to calculate the phase change at turning point accurately , for which there exists a condition such that the dimensionless parameter @xmath63 is small . as noted in sec.iii the inclusion of the anharmonicity keeps this condition over a region where otherwise the condition becomes invalid , so that a correct phase change at turning point can be obtained .",
    "it is thus important to consider the anharmonicity effect in the application of the phase loss approach to an anharmonic potential such as double - well potential ."
