    "the large hadron collider opens an opportunity to explore kinematic regions where particles produced in high - energy collisions posses large transverse momenta and rapidities .",
    "the production of electroweak bosons and jets is a vital part of tests of standard model as well as searches of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "furthermore it has been recognized in @xcite that by studies of associated production of electroweak bosons and jets may provide a new insight into the transverse partonic structure of hadrons at small @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is the momentum fraction of the hadron taken by a parton participating in the hard collision .",
    "furthermore , such a final state , being a combination of colorful and colorless particles , gives the opportunity for particularly interesting investigations complementary to results obtained in studies of pure jet final states @xcite and drell - yan pairs @xcite .",
    "in particular the final state rescatterings due to soft color exchanges should have less impact on the properties of produced final state as compared to pure jet final states .",
    "this work is motivated by a recent lhcb measurement @xcite at @xmath4 of the process @xmath5 in the forward direction within the pseudorapidity range @xmath6 .",
    "the final - state muon and anti - muon were required to have transverse momenta @xmath7 while the leading jet was considered with two different cuts : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the jets were reconstructed using the anti-@xmath10 algorithm with radius @xmath11 and they were required to be separated from muon tracks on the @xmath12 plane ( azimuthal angle - pesudorapidity ) by a distance @xmath13 . the muon - pair was required to have an invariant mass within the range @xmath14 .",
    "the rapidity constraint assures that in the partonic picture of the process , one of the initial state partons carries a rather small fraction @xmath15 of the corresponding hadron momentum @xmath16 , while the other must have a fraction @xmath17 ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] ) .    in order to describe the process perturbatively ,",
    "one definitely needs to go beyond the pure collinear factorization and support the calculation by a resummations . in the modern advanced approaches",
    "this is achieved by parton showers and hadronization as implemented for example in pythia @xcite . in the present work we consider another approach ,",
    "namely a resummation of logarithms of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a hard scale and @xmath21 is a certain additional scale given by the imbalance of the final states on the transverse plane .",
    "this approach captures certain aspects of the process more accurately already at lowest order of the strong coupling constant in the hard process .    in the present paper , we will therefore attempt to study the process within so called high energy factorization , or more precisely , using so - called hybrid high energy factorization motivated by the works @xcite . within the asymmetric kinematic situation @xmath17 described above",
    ", the cross section for the process under consideration can be expressed by the following formula @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the unintegrated gluon distribution for hadron @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a collinear pdf and @xmath26 is the hard cross section obtained from a gauge invariant tree - level off - shell amplitude for the process @xmath27 , and where @xmath28 refers to quarks as well as anti - quarks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "let us note , that the original high energy factorization prescription was designed to study inclusive small @xmath2 processes and the corresponding unintegrated gluon distribution was assumed to undergo the balitski - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) evolution equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for more exclusive processes it is however necessary to include the subleading bfkl effects , such as kinematic constraint ensuring energy conservation , large-@xmath2 correction , running strong coupling constant , and  notably  the hard scale dependence .",
    "the last , denoted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hen_fact_2 ] ) as @xmath20 , turns out to be essential to describe the data under consideration . in the present work we shall not discuss the validity of the model ( [ eq : hen_fact_2 ] ) on the theoretical level .",
    "instead , we shall test it phenomenologically against the existing data . for a more detailed review of various approaches to the small @xmath2 factorization and related issues",
    "see e.g. @xcite . for",
    "a derivation of hybrid high energy factorization from the dilute limit of the color glass condensate approach see @xcite .",
    "using the formalism described in the preceding section we have computed the cross sections for @xmath29 production .",
    "we have used two programs to calculate off - shell @xmath30 amplitude ( with @xmath3 and @xmath31 exchange ) and to cross - check the results .",
    "the first program is a very handy library  ( avhlib )  @xcite in fortran , in which the approach of @xcite is implemented .",

    "we work with the 5 flavour scheme and use the cteq10nlo set @xcite for the collinear pdfs . for the unintegrated gluon distributions we consider the following models ( in brackets with bold font we give our abbreviations for the models ) :    * bfkl evolution with kinematic constraint , running strong coupling constant , dglap effects including the contribution from the quark sea @xcite and supplemented with the nonlinear term @xcite ; the initial condition has been fitted to hera data @xcite ( ` ks ` ) * hard scale dependent ` ks ` ; the hard scale dependence is achieved by implementing the sudakov form factor on the generated events in such a way that the total cross section remains unchanged @xcite ( ` ks+sudakov ` ) * similar to above , but the sudakov form factor is implemented to the ` ks`density in such a way that the integrated gluon density remains unchanged @xcite ( ` kutak - nonlinear - prd15 ` ) * the simplified kimber - martin - ryskin model @xcite applied to mrstw08 pdfs ; this model gives unintegrated gluon distribution that is hard scale dependent ( ` kmr ` ) * bfkl evolution with kinematic constraint , running strong coupling constant and the dglap contribution coming only from gluons and fitted to the lhc jet data @xcite ( ` lhc - fit ` ) * hard scale dependent lhc fit ( ` lhc - fit+sudakov ` )    the hard scale was chosen to be the average of the three large scales appearing in the problem : the mass of the @xmath3 boson , its @xmath36 and the @xmath36 of the jet .",

    "[ fig : dphi10]-[fig : ptj ] represent the theoretical uncertainty obtained by varying the hard scale by a factor of two .",
    "the differential cross sections are normalized to the total cross section , as in @xcite .",
    "we list the total cross sections for different models in table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".[table1]total cross sections obtained from different models for the unintegrated gluon density .",
    "the model uncertainties are defined through variations of the hard scale . for the data the total uncertainty",
    "is estimated as an average square error from statistical , systematic and luminosity errors as given in  @xcite .",
    "we do not include models ` ks+sudakov `  and ` lhc - fit+sudakov `  as the sudakov - type resummation applied there does not change the total cross section . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us first discuss the normalized differential cross sections .",
    "we can conclude that the azimuthal decorrelations are described reasonably well for both jet @xmath36 cuts for most of the models .",
    "it was however essential for this observable to include the hard scale dependence in unintegrated gluon distributions .",
    "as this observable is the most sensitive one for the small @xmath2 effects this underlines the importance of the resummation of the logarithms @xmath43 , where @xmath20 is the hard scale provided by the hard process and @xmath21 is the transverse momentum of the gluon in unintegrated gluon distributions , on the top of the small @xmath2 logarithms .",
    "the effect of this sudakov - type resummation was also important for the transverse momentum spectrum of @xmath3 boson .",
    "for the other observables it has had much less impact .",
    "since our calculations are not interfaced with any sort of final state parton shower we expected rather rough description of transverse momenta spectra .",
    "our actual study shows however that the situation is relatively good for the spectrum of @xmath3 boson ( except very low transverse momentum ) , figs .",
    "[ fig : ptz10]-[fig : ptz20 ] , and indeed fails for the jet spectrum , fig .",
    "[ fig : ptj ] . this can be attributed to the fact that all unintegrated gluon distributions we have used contain contribution from pieces of splitting functions subleading at low @xmath2 ( see @xcite for an analysis of the impact of this correction on jet @xmath36 spectra ) .",
    "this correction seems to be enough for the colorless final state while the color rescattering for the final state jet is evidently missing . also , the next - to - leading correction in the hard process is necessary to improve the description of the transverse momentum spectra .",
    "the lhc - jet - motivated unintegrated gluon densities , which were actually fitted to the lhc jet transverse momentum spectra behave similar to the other gluon densities .",
    "this gives one more clue that the improvement in the hard process in terms of higher order corrections or / and a resummation is necessary .",
    "for @xmath38 the ` kutak - nonlinear - prd15 `  and the ` kmr `  models overestimate the normalized transverse momentum spectrum of the @xmath3 boson .",
    "these models implement a hard scale dependence but the spectra they give are almost the same as from the ` ks`model , which is hard - scale - independent ( the difference is however in the uncertainty which is much bigger for the hard - scale - dependent models ) .",
    "this means that the sudakov - type resummation in the former models has no effect for this observable with such large @xmath36 cut . on the contrary , the sudakov - type resummation with unitarity constraint ( in the sense of preserving the total cross section ) applied to the ` ks `  or ` lhc - fit `  improves the results .",
    "interestingly , the unintegrated gluon distribution which comes from the fit to the lhc jet data does not perform better that the distributions obtained from the inclusive dis data .",
    "this suggests that the effects of factorization breaking due to the lack of universality is rather weak at the phenomenological level . as already mentioned above , this suggests also that one needs higher order corrections in the hard process .",
    "indeed , as observed in @xcite the @xmath36 spectra can not be described by improving the evolution of unintegrated gluon distribution itself .",
    "one should mention , that the evolution equations that were fitted to the lhc data did not include a contribution from the sea quarks on the dense hadron side , whereas this contribution is present in the other approaches .",
    "it is however unlikely that this can improve the situation .",
    "present calculations did not take into account the situation where the off - shell initial - state parton is a quark or an anti - quark .",
    "we expect this contribution to be small , as at small @xmath2 gluons dominate significantly . on the other hand",
    ", the process @xmath44 gives an important contribution in the collinear approach .",
    "since in reality the probed values of @xmath2 are not extremely small , such process might be important in the high energy factorization .",
    "practical applications require however a set of unintegrated quark distributions , consistent with the unintegrated gluon distributions .",
    "inclusion of those is left for future studies .",
    "as seen from the table  [ table1 ] our calculations strongly underestimate the total cross section as compared to the data .",
    "this should be probably attributed to the hard multi - parton interaction ( mpi ) effects which are not taken into account in the hybrid high energy factorization .",
    "this statement is supported by the observation that the description of the azimuthal decorrelations is very good up to the normalization , which , when corrected , will only shift the data eventually forming a `` pedestal '' .",
    "it is also known that mpis indeed contribute only a pedestal to the azimuthal decorrelations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , as the two partons coming from independent scatterings are completely decorrelated ( to leading order ) and thus the azimuthal decorrelation distribution is flat .",
    "the subject of mpis in the high energy factorization is however rather complicated and needs a separate study . in principle , on the dense hadron side ( i.e. for the one probed at small @xmath2 ) , the soft mpis can be partially taken into account by means of the nonlinear term in the evolution equation , as for example in the ` ks `  unintegrated gluon density or its extensions .",
    "therefore , one has to be careful not to make a double counting when using some phenomenological models by an inclusion of double hard scattering mechanism .",
    "actually the problem extends beyond the saturation regime as the high energy factorization contributes to higher twists as well as mpis , at least for certain observables @xcite .",
    "these subjects are however beyond the scope of the present work .",
