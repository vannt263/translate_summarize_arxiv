    "recently , asymmetric @xmath5 colliders with high luminosities to explore @xmath6 violation in @xmath7 meson system ( @xmath7-factory ) have been proposed@xcite . in a @xmath7-factory detector , an identification of the particle species is an important issue . in particular , the separation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the momentum region of @xmath8 gev / c is indispensable for studying many @xmath7 meson decay channels@xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "cherenkov counter equipped with silica aerogels having a low refractive index is one of the most promising devices since it has been widely used in high energy experiments@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the use of an aerogel cherenkov counter enables us to reduce the material for a particle identification device which is located in front of an electromagnetic calorimter .",
    "the requirements imposed on our aerogel cherenkov counter are : ( i ) the refractive index of aerogel ( @xmath9 ) should be in the @xmath10 range in order to to achieve a @xmath11/@xmath12 separation capability in the region of @xmath8 gev / c .",
    "( ii ) the optical transparency of the aerogel should be high .",
    "notice that cherenkov photons emitted by an injected particle becomes significantly small in our case because the cherenkov light yields are proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the loss of photons in the aerogel due to absorptions and scatterings should be minimized .",
    "( iii ) efficient photon collection and detection under a strong magnetic field in the counter have to be considered to avoid any inefficiency for @xmath11 identification .",
    "we require that the detection efficency of @xmath11 identification should be greater than 90 % , thus resulting in the averaged number of photoelectrons greater than 2.5 for @xmath14 .",
    "because aerogels with @xmath15 are not commercially available , we have developed a new aerogel production technique with low densities and high transparencies , and a test counter based on these aerogels has been built . using this counter ,",
    "the optical characteristics of aerogels and various conditions of counters were tested in order to optimize some parameters for our detector design .    in the next section , the production technique of our new aerogel",
    "is described .",
    "their optical properties are given in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to results using a test beam . after describing basic properties of the new aerogels , an investigation of the light collection system , including tests of photomultipliers ,",
    "is also given here .",
    "based on the results from the beam test , a detector consideration is discussed in section 5 .",
    "finally , section 6 summarizes this paper .",
    "silica aerogel with a higher refractive index than @xmath16 has been produced in a conventional single - step method@xcite . in this method ,",
    "tetraalkoxysilane and water are mixed in an excess of alcohol as a solvent .",
    "the following hydrolysis and condensation of silicon alkoxides with the help of a catalyst are simultaneously proceeded in a single container : @xmath17 in these two successive reactions , the solution becomes colloidal .",
    "then , aging is done in order to form three - dimensional networks of sio@xmath18 clusters connected by a siloxan linkage .",
    "after the alcogel is made , it is dried in an autoclave at a point safely higher than the critical point ( supercritical drying ) to remove any alcohols . the density and , consequently the refractive index of the aerogel",
    "is mainly determined from the quantity of alcohol added in the first stage as a solvent .",
    "if the quantity of alcohol is increased in order to make low density aerogel , it becomes difficult to form a gel with high porosity since the backward reactions take place .",
    "this is why aerogels with low refractive indices or optically good properties can not be made using this method .    to make aerogel with a lower refractive index ,",
    "a `` two - step sol - gel '' method has been developed at lawrence livermore national laboratory@xcite .",
    "they produce partially hydrolysed and partially condensed silica oil in the first step .",
    "next , the alcohol is distilled off from the silica oil .",
    "this solution is called a `` precursor '' . then , it is mixed with a non - alcohol solvent , and polymerization",
    "is then performed by adding an alkali catalyst , which makes sio@xmath18 cluster pores having a smaller size than an acid catalyst does .",
    "the gels , after aging , were dried under the supercritical condition , yielding a high - porosity aerogel with a low refractive index .",
    "this two - step method is one of the best ways to produce aerogels having a low refractive index .",
    "there are , however , some complicated processes , such as the distilation of alcohol .",
    "our new production method of aerogels with a low refractive index is essentially the same as the single - step method except for the use of methylalkoxide `` oligomer '' instead of tetraalkoxysilane . figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] -(a ) and -(b ) are charts for the oligomer and the presursor in the two - step method obtained by a gas chromatograph mass - spectrometer , respectively .",
    "8.6 cm    from these charts , we can compare compositions of the oligomer with those of the precursor . as can be seen ,",
    "the compositions of the oligomer are almost identical to those of the precursor .",
    "namely , the oligomer is a stable liquid after partial hydrolysation and partial condensation .",
    "therefore , the advantage of our method is to simplify the production processes , which is very important for the mass - production of aerogels , with keeping the merits of the two - step method .",
    "in addition , the oligomer can be easily obtained on a commercial basis and is not expensive .",
    "another advantage of our technique is the hydrophobic characteristic of the aerogels . in the production process",
    ", the characteristic of the alcogel can be changed so as to be hydrophobic by replacing any silanol groups ( -oh ) into hydrophobic ones .",
    "our production methods are as follows . at first , two solutions are prepared .",
    "one is made by adding an oligomer in ethyl alcohol as a solvent , and the other is distilled water with ethyl alcohol . here , ammonia water is also added in this solution as an alkali catalyst to polymerize small and uniform pores .",
    "these two solutions are mixed in a polystyrene container at room temperature .",
    "after a few minutes , the gelation takes place , and the alcogel is made .",
    "the alcogel is put into a sealed vessel in order to suppress evaporation of the ethyl alcohol , and is kept at room temperature for one week .",
    "then , the sealed vessel , in which the alcogel has been placed , is filled with ethyl alcohol vapor in order to proceed the formation of a three - dimensional network of sio@xmath18 .",
    "after that , alcogel is moved into a stainless - steel bag from a polystyrene container and is left in ethyl alcohol for one week .    to make alcogel hydrophobic ,",
    "special treatment is taken .",
    "the silanol groups on the surface of sio@xmath18 is likely to be charged and contacting other ions .",
    "it is thus replaced into si(ch@xmath19)@xmath19 groups by adding hydrophobic agent , for example , hexamethyldisilazane , into ethyl alcohol , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "12.6 cm    this solution , in which the alcogel is moved , is stirred by an electrical power agitator at @xmath20 .",
    "this process is completed in @xmath21 hours , which depends on the temperature .",
    "the replacement of the hydrophilic groups in the alcogel with hydrophobic ones also plays an important role in preserving its volume after supercritical drying in an autoclave since shrinkage of the aerogel is considered to be due to the electrically attractive force among the silanol groups and/or between the silanol groups and other ions .    after this reaction ,",
    "the alcogel is again sunk in ethyl alcohol , and the alcohol is replaced once every 3 days . during this period ,",
    "ammonia in the alcogel , which was generated in the hydrophobic reaction , is solved into alcohol .    to transform the alcogel into aerogel",
    ", the alcogel is dried at the supercritical point . here , alcohol is replaced into carbon dioxide before heating .",
    "the pressure and temperature at the supercritical point of carbon dioxide is much lower than that of ethyl alcohol .",
    "it , therefore , provides a safer and more economical benefits .",
    "a complete description can be found in ref.@xcite    an aerogel of @xmath22 @xmath23 with @xmath24 has been successfully made using this method .",
    "we produced 22 pieces of aerogels with this size .",
    "[ fig3 ] is a photograph of the obtained aerogel .",
    "8.1 cm    it was shrunk to be about @xmath25 % in volume .",
    "some cracks could be seen inside the volume or on its surface although they were tolerable .",
    "its optical properties were described in the next section .",
    "the transmission of the aerogel obtained with the new method described above was measured using a photospectrometer@xcite .",
    "the thickness of the aerogel of the sample was 2.2 cm .",
    "the obtained data can be translated into the transmission length ( @xmath26 ) by the function : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the transmission and thickness of the aerogel , respectively .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the transmission length as a function of the wave length ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the transmission length strongly depends on the wave length .",
    "these effects can be related to the size and uniformity of microscopic pores of the aerogel .",
    "our results are compared with those of other measurements in table  [ table : trans ] .    .",
    "summary of measurements of the transmission length ( cm ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the position dependence of the incident particle was measured for three counter configurations ; basic configuration ( for a reference ) , type a and type b. the beam used was @xmath31 gev / c @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath34 directions were defined as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "reffig11 shows @xmath35 as a function of @xmath34 at different @xmath33 for the reference configuration .    after summing pulse heights of two pmt s ,",
    "the resultant @xmath35 has almost uniform response . the same figure , but for type a , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "the same tendency can be seen .",
    "the results for type b are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "although the mirror option provides the largest @xmath35 , it causes a strong dependence of the beam position . from this study",
    ", it was found that type a gives better results than those from the reference configuration at the center injection and that for the uniform position dependence , on the other hand , type b provides maximum @xmath35 , but has a strong dependence on the beam position .",
    "therefore , type a will be adopted for our final design .      in a realistic environment , a read out for an aerogel cherenkov counter should be done in a strong magnetic field of 1 tesla . for this purpose , a fine - mesh type photomultiplier has been developed . to check the feasibility for aerogel read out with fine - mesh pmt s , two @xmath36 quantacon - type pmt s were replaced into two @xmath36 fine - mesh pmt s ( r2490 - 05 , assembly type , h2611 manufactured by hamamatsu p.k.k .  ) .",
    "this pmt contains 16 dynodes in the amplification stage .",
    "the gains of two pmt s were adjusted in the same way as mentioned previously . here , a reference counter configuration was used , and @xmath31 gev / c and @xmath37 gev / c @xmath11 beams were injected .",
    "[ fig14 ] indicates the pulse height distribution detected from one fine - mesh pmt .",
    "no peak , but a long exponential - like tail , was observed .",
    "this phenomena is described in ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath35 was extracted by counting the number of pedestal events .",
    "however , there was an ambiguity in separating pedestal events from the signal distribution .",
    "this uncertainty was estimated by varying the threshold value by which the pedestal was discriminated , and was obtained to be @xmath38 % .",
    "@xmath35 at @xmath31 gev / c was calculated to be @xmath39 as listed in table  [ table : config ] .",
    "this value is about @xmath40 % smaller than that from quantacon - type pmt s .",
    "the difference is considered to result from the sensitive area of a photocathode mounted in fine - mesh pmt s .",
    "based on these tests , we found that our aerogel has good characteristics .",
    "light collection of type a ( described in section 4 ) will be optimal since it gives reasonable number of photoelectrons and small position dependence .",
    "the use of fine - mesh pmt s for the counter read out decreases the photoelectron yields .",
    "nevertheless , the number of photoelectrons obtained from two @xmath36 fine - mesh pmt s ( @xmath39 ) is sufficiently large for a negative identification of @xmath1 , however , it does not work as a positive identification of @xmath1 out of a huge number of @xmath0 . in the case of @xmath41 , for example",
    ", this feature is crucial@xcite .",
    "according to these considerations , an increase in the photoelectron yields is particularly necessary .",
    "it can be improved by ; ( i ) changing the refractive index from 1.013 to 1.018 . by making this change",
    ", we can gain intrinsic cherenkov photons by a factor of 1.4 .",
    "simultaneously , however , this trades the particle separation capability .",
    "the threshold momentum for @xmath12 is reduced to be 2.59 gev / c from 3.05 gev / c .",
    "( ii ) producing more transparent aerogels by optimizing some conditions in the production processes such as temprature .",
    "more transparent aerogels can increase the effective absorption length of the counter .",
    "this allows us to stack more aerogel sheets in the counter box",
    ".    moreover , there are still some cracks in our aerogel as described in section 2 .",
    "thus , the optimizations of some parameters such as pressure in the supercritical drying should be done .",
    "silica aerogels having refractive indices of @xmath42 have been successfully produced . a cherenkov counter based on new aerogels was constructed , and its properties were studied with the test beam .",
    "the optical properties of aerogels were good enough to compensate for the intrinsically small number of photoelectrons emitted by a charged particle .",
    "two types of light collection systems , diffuse and mirror reflection , were tested .",
    "the mirror option provided a large number of photoelectrons , however , strong position dependence of the injection point was observed .",
    "the diffuse scattering option , on the other hand , gave reasonable results .",
    "moreover , fine - mesh photomultipliers , which are able to detect photons under a strong magnetic field , were used for the read out .",
    "the resultant light yields were marginally feasible for our experiment .    based on these studies ,",
    "our design of a cherenkov counter , which can identify @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the region of @xmath8 gev / c , was considered . to increase the number of photoelectrons observed with fine - mesh photomultipliers , the refractive index of silica aerogels",
