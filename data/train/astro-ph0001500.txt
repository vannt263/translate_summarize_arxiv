    "gravitational lenses offer an attractive independent method of determining the hubble constant ( @xmath2 ) on cosmological scales without the systematic difficulties associated with the local distance ladder ( refsdal 1964 , 1966 ) .",
    "six of the more than 50 known gravitational lenses now have time delays that can be used to estimate @xmath2 : b  0218 + 357 ( biggs et al .  1999 ) ; q  0957 + 561 ( schild & thomson 1995 ; kundi et al .  1997 ; haarsma et al.1999 ) ; pg  1115 + 080 ( schechter et al .  1997 ; barkana 1997 ) ; b  1600 + 434 ( hjorth et al .  1999 ) ; b  1608 + 656 ( fassnacht et al.1999 ) ; and pks  1830@xmath3211 ( lovell et al .",
    "1998 ) ; preliminary @xmath2 estimates for five of these systems have been compiled by koopmans & fassnacht ( 1999 ) .",
    "once a time delay is accurately determined , the uncertainties in the derived value of the hubble constant are due almost entirely to the systematic uncertainties in the model for the lensing potential , plus `` cosmic variance '' due to the effects of weak density inhomogeneities along the line of sight ( seljak 1994 ; barkana 1996 ) .",
    "only two of the time delay lenses have been modeled in sufficient detail to fully understand the systematic uncertainties created by their geometries : q  0957 + 561 ( falco , gorenstein & shapiro 1985 , 1991 ; kochanek 1991 ; bernstein , tyson & kochanek 1993 ; grogin & narayan 1996 ; chartas et al .",

    "the lens consists of a brightest cluster galaxy and its parent cluster , and the value of the hubble constant depends on the mass balance between the two components .",
    "judgments about the ability of models to determine the correct mass balance vary significantly : optimistic estimates yield @xmath4 at 95% confidence ( grogin & narayan 1996 , using the stellar dynamical models of romanowsky & kochanek 1999 ) ; while more pessimistic estimates yield @xmath5 ( kochanek 1991 ; bernstein et al .  1993",
    "; bernstein & fischer 1999 ) . in pg  1115 + 080 ,",
    "the lens is one of the brighter galaxies in a small group , but the four - image geometry easily determines the relative roles of the primary lens galaxy and the group . instead , the value of the hubble constant depends on the assumed radial mass distribution of the primary lens galaxy .",
    "galaxy models with dark matter and mass distributions consistent with the best estimates for early - type galaxies lead to low values for the hubble constant ( @xmath6 ; impey et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "impey et al .  (",
    "1998 ) discovered an einstein ring image of the quasar host galaxy in the pg  1115 + 080 lens , and noted that the geometry of the ring could be used to break the degeneracy in the lens models .",

    "we observed q  0957 + 561 with the hubble space telescope as part of the cfa ",
    "arizona space telescope lens survey ( castles ; lehr et al .  1999 ;",
    "falco et al .  1999 ) . using the nic2 camera , we obtained a 2800-second f160w ( h band ) image of q  0957 + 561 divided into four dithered exposures .",
    "a log of the observations is presented in table 1 .",
    "we reduced the images using nicred , a custom reduction package developed for castles ( lehr et al .",
    "we also reanalyzed archival wfpc2 images , including a 32200-second f555w ( v band ) exposure and a 2620-second f814w ( i band ) exposure ( bernstein et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the optical images",
    ", q  0957 + 561 fell in chip wf3 of the wfpc2 camera ( with pixel size @xmath001 , compared to @xmath00076 for nic2 ) .",
    "because the images a and b of q  0957 + 561 were saturated in the wfpc2 images , we derived our astrometry of a , b and the lens galaxy g1 exclusively from our unsaturated nic2 data .",
    "figure 1a shows our combined h band image , which prominently shows the lens galaxy and the two quasar images .",
    "the quasar host galaxy is visible as a faint arc next to the quasar a image .",
    "table 2 summarizes a photometric model consisting of point sources for the two quasar images and elliptical de vaucouleurs models for the main lens galaxy ( g1 ) and a neighboring galaxy ( g2 , not seen in figure 1 ) .",
    "the lens galaxy is known to have a small ellipticity gradient and isophote twist ( bernstein et al .",
    "1997 ) , but we used only a simple elliptical model .",
    "figure 1b shows the residuals after subtracting the psf - convolved photometric model from the original image , and figure 1c shows these residuals convolved with a @xmath00076 ( 1 pixel ) fwhm gaussian to enhance the visibility of low surface brightness features .",
    "the residual image shows the host galaxy image near quasar a to be an arc distorted tangentially relative to the lens galaxy .",
    "it also reveals an extended asymmetric arc near the b quasar image .",
    "if the residuals near quasar b were created by the error of fitting a simple elliptical surface brightness model to a galaxy with a radially varying ellipticity and orientation , we would expect them to have reflection symmetry through the center of the galaxy . because the arc near quasar b lacks such symmetry",
    ", we conclude that it is the lensed counterpart of the arc near quasar a , and that both are images of the quasar host galaxy .",
    "the residual h band image also shows two additional sources , one east of quasar a and another just west of quasar b ( labeled g3 and g4 in figure 1c ) .",
    "their positions and photometric properties are given in table 2 .",
    "these objects correspond in position and v magnitude to two of the faint sources seen in the deep v band image and labeled blobs 7 and 1 ( respectively ) by bernstein et al .",
    "their colors ( especially v@xmath3i ) are similar to those of g1 and g2 and suggest that they are probably faint cluster members . whether or not they are associated with the cluster , it is clear that they are not multiply imaged and are not associated with the quasar source .",
    "the fact that g4 is not part of the host galaxy arc will be important to remember when examining the arc structure predicted by lens models ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "the lensed host galaxy is not detected at significant levels in the shallow i band image , although a visual examination suggests that low - level residuals are present and should be detected at a significant level with a longer integration",
    ". the deep v band image does not have large extended arcs , but it does show seven faint `` blobs '' and a thin arclet ( bernstein et al .  1997 ) . as noted above",
    ", at least two of the blobs are probably faint cluster galaxies .",
    "however , blobs 2 and 3 and the arclet have been identified as possible lensed features , and lens models support this interpretation ( barkana et al .",
    "1999 ; bernstein & fischer 1999 ; chae 1999 ) .",
    "since the v band corresponds to rest - frame uv at the quasar redshift @xmath1 , these features probably correspond to discrete star forming regions in the host galaxy .",
    "we follow previous models and include blobs 2 and 3 plus two `` knots '' in the arclet as model constraints ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "we estimated the fluxes of the host galaxy images using the iraf task polyphot , which measures fluxes within polygonal apertures .",
    "we traced polygonal apertures along the edges of the distorted images of the host galaxy at the @xmath7 level above the sky .",
    "we found that both lensed images of the host galaxy have h band brightnesses of @xmath018.4 mag , and a surface brightness of @xmath020.6 mag / arcsec@xmath8 ( both images have approximately the same area ) .",
    "the main source of uncertainty for the brightness estimates is the relatively large size of the residuals from the subtraction of the quasar images , compared to the ( low ) brightness levels of the arcs ; we estimate the uncertainties to be @xmath00.3 mag .    given an acceptable lens model we can map the host galaxy images to the source plane to obtain a map of the unlensed host galaxy ( see  3.3 ) . in principle",
    "we could use the source maps to measure the photometric properties of the host galaxy .",
    "however , in practice the imperfect quasar subtraction corrupts the flux in the bright central regions of the source and hinders the measurement .",
    "one robust statement we can make is that part of the host galaxy is doubly - imaged like the quasar , but part of it is quadruply - imaged ( see  4 ) .",
    "this accounts for the shape differences between the a and b arcs : the a arc is a single distorted image of the host galaxy , while the b arc is a composite of three images that straddle the lensing critical line .",
    "q  0957 + 561 is the most thoroughly studied gravitational lens .",
    "the system comprises a radio - loud quasar at redshift @xmath1 lensed into two images by a brightest cluster galaxy and its parent cluster at redshift @xmath9 ( walsh , carswell & weymann 1979 ; young et al .  1980 ) .",
    "there is a time delay of @xmath10 days between the images ( schild & thomson 1995 ; kundi et al .",
    "1997 ; haarsma et al .",
    "vlbi observations have resolved each image into a core and @xmath080 milli - arcsecond jet ( garrett et al.1994 ) .",
    "deep optical images have uncovered faint `` blobs '' and `` knots '' that are probably lensed image pairs of star forming regions in the quasar host galaxy ( bernstein et al .",
    "our observations have revealed infrared arcs representing distorted images of the quasar host galaxy . in this section",
    "we discuss how to use these and other data to constrain models of the system and values for the hubble constant @xmath2 . in ",
    "3.1 we review the theory of lens modeling and discuss important model degeneracies . in ",
    " 3.2 and 3.3 we discuss previous and new observational constraints on models . in ",
    " 3.4 and 3.5 we describe classes of models applied to the lens galaxy and cluster in q  0957 + 561 , summarizing previous classes and introducing a new one .",
    "finally , in  3.6 we discuss how we apply the observational constraints to our new class of models .      in a multiply - imaged gravitational lens system ,",
    "the light from a distant source is deflected by the gravitational potential of foreground objects so that we observe multiple images of the source .",
    "the lensing potential is usually dominated by a single galaxy , although there may be non - negligible perturbations from other objects nearby .",
    "basic lens theory is presented in the book by schneider , ehlers & falco ( 1992 ) , and we quote the relevant results here .",
    "the lensing potential @xmath11 is determined by the two - dimensional poisson equation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the surface mass density in units of the critical surface density for lensing ( in angular units ) , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are angular diameter distances from the observer to the lens and source , respectively , and @xmath17 is the angular diameter distance from the lens to the source .",
    "the lensing potential deflects a light ray so that the angular position @xmath18 of the source on the sky and the angular position @xmath19 of an image are related by the lens equation , @xmath20 there is an image corresponding to each solution @xmath21 of this equation .",
    "lensing introduces a time delay between the ray paths of two images of the same source . the time delay between images at positions @xmath21 and @xmath22 is @xmath23 ,      \\label{eq : tdel}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the redshift of the lens .",
    "this equation is the basis of attempts to use lensing to determine the hubble constant @xmath2 . by measuring light curves of images",
    "one can determine the time delay @xmath25 .",
    "a lens model gives the term in square brackets in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdel ] ) .",
    "the combination of distances is @xmath26 and only weakly dependent on other cosmological parameters .",
    "a lens model consists of a description of the lensing potential @xmath11 .",
    "the observed images provide two principle constraints on such a model .",
    "first , roughly speaking an image at projected distance @xmath27 from the main lens galaxy measures the enclosed mass @xmath28 . in q  0957 + 561 and many 2-image gravitational lenses , the two images lie at different distances @xmath29 , so they measure two masses @xmath30 and @xmath31 and hence constrain the mass profile ( e.g.  grogin & narayan 1996 ) .",
    "second , with at least three well - determined positions ( two images and the lens galaxy , or four images ) , the images determine the quadrupole moment of the net potential .",
    "however , there are four properties of the mass distribution that must be determined for a complete description of the model : the mass profile of the main lens galaxy ; the shape ( ellipticity and orientation ) of the main lens galaxy ; the shear from the the gravitational tidal field induced by objects near the lens galaxy ; and the amount of gravitational focusing ( or `` convergence '' ) contributed by the environment of the lens galaxy .    with more unknown quantities than constraints , there are two common degeneracies in the lens models .",
    "first , to lowest order the convergence @xmath32 contributed by the environment can not be determined by lens models , which leads to the so - called `` mass sheet degeneracy '' ( falco et al .",
    "if a lensing potential @xmath33 fits the observed data , then any potential @xmath34 will fit the data equally well .",
    "the @xmath32 term is equivalent to the potential from a uniform mass sheet with surface density @xmath35 .",
    "the only potentially observable difference between the lens models represented by @xmath11 and @xmath36 is in the predicted time delays , @xmath37 however , this effect is not observable if we want to use gravitational lensing to determine the hubble constant because it simply translates into a scaling of the inferred value for @xmath2 . if @xmath2 and @xmath38 are the values inferred from the two lens models , then @xmath39 this analysis has used only the lowest order term of the contribution from the environment , but the higher order terms can not necessarily eliminate the degeneracy ( e.g.  chae 1999 ) .",
    "the mass sheet degeneracy is important for q  0957 + 561 because the parent cluster of the lens galaxy contributes a significant convergence .",
    "the only way to break this degeneracy is to obtain an independent mass constraint to determine the relative contributions of the main lens galaxy and the environment to the mass enclosed by the images ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "the second important degeneracy is between the shape of the main lens galaxy and the shear from the gravitational tidal field of objects in the environment of the lens galaxy .",
    "because the images determine only the quadrupole moment of the total potential , there can be a wide range of parameter space in which the lens galaxy ellipticity and the external shear combine to produce the required joint quadrupole ( e.g.  keeton et al .",
    "consider a 2-image lens with image positions @xmath40 and @xmath41 , a galaxy potential @xmath42 , and an external shear with amplitude @xmath43 and direction @xmath44 .",
    "fitting the image positions exactly is equivalent to solving the equation @xmath45 where the shear is described by the tensor @xmath46 .\\ ] ] no matter what galaxy potential @xmath42 is used , it is straightforward to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : shr ] ) for the shear parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in other words , one can fit the image positions in a 2-image lens to arbitrary precision for _ any model lens galaxy _ , although in some cases the inferred shear @xmath43 may be unphysically strong .",
    "constraints from the images fluxes or additional images often break this degeneracy , although the @xmath47 range of models may still be large . in previous models of q  0957 + 561 ,",
    "the additional constraints came primarily from the vlbi observations of the quasar images , which show several discrete components with @xmath00.1 milli - arcsecond errorbars ( garrett et al .",
    "1994 ; barkana et al .",
    "it is easy to be misled about the true structure of the potential , however , when using such strong constraints ( see kochanek 1991 ; bernstein et al .",
    "1993 ; bernstein & fischer 1999 ) . internal structure in the lens galaxy , such as isophote twists or lumpiness in the mass distribution , may affect the images at sub - milli - arcsecond scales ( e.g.  mao & schneider 1998 ) .",
    "neglecting that structure forces the models to adjust large - scale model components in order to fit small - scale constraints , leading them to converge to a best - fit solution that is well defined ( i.e.  with no apparent degeneracy ) but incorrect . in q",
    "0957 + 561 , the observed ellipticity gradient and isophote twist suggest that the galaxy does have important internal structure ( bernstein & fischer 1997 ) , and in  4 we show that models neglecting this structure indeed converged to incorrect solutions .      in q",
    "0957 + 561 the high - resolution vlbi maps of the quasar images provide strong position constraints , plus somewhat weaker constraints on the relative magnification matrix between the images ( garrett et al .",
    "1994 ; barkana et al .",
    "the optical blobs and knots offer additional but weaker position constraints .",
    "the knots are particularly useful because they appear to represent a pair of `` fold '' images and thus require the lensing critical line to pass between them ( see bernstein & fischer 1999 ) .",
    "the constraints from these images leave two of the three model degeneracies discussed in  3.1 : the mass sheet degeneracy due to the convergence provided by the cluster ; and the degeneracy between the lens galaxy shape and the cluster shear .",
    "several steps have been taken to break the mass sheet degeneracy by determining the relative masses of the lens galaxy and cluster .",
    "first , rhee ( 1991 ) , falco et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and tonry & franx ( 1999 ) measured the lens galaxy s central velocity dispersion to be @xmath48 .",
    "romanowsky & kochanek ( 1999 ) used stellar dynamical models to translate this into constraints on the lens galaxy mass and concluded that @xmath49 of the image separation is contributed by the galaxy ( and the rest by the cluster convergence ) .",
    "second , fischer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) detected a weak lensing signal from the cluster , which bernstein & fischer ( 1999 ) translated into an estimate of the mean surface density of all mass inside an aperture of radius 30  centered on the lens galaxy , @xmath50 furthermore , bernstein & fischer ( 1999 ) showed that the surface mass density @xmath51 of the cluster at the position of the lens galaxy is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mean mass density of a model lens galaxy . in this way one can combine the weak lensing measurement with a lens model to estimate @xmath54 ( see  5.3 ) .",
    "there have been other attempts to measure the cluster mass , using the velocity dispersion of the galaxies in the cluster ( @xmath55 ; garrett , walsh & carswell 1992 ; angonin - willaime , soucail & vanderriest 1994 ) or the x - rays from the cluster gas ( chartas et al .",
    "1998 ) , but they are still limited by significant systematic uncertainties .",
    "although measurements of the cluster surface density are important ( especially for determining @xmath2 , see  5.4 ) , they do not break the degeneracy between the lens galaxy shape and the cluster shear .",
    "another approach is to constrain the shape of the lens galaxy s mass distribution .",
    "the orientation of the lens galaxy s light distribution should offer a guide to the orientation of its mass distribution , because other lenses suggest that mass and light are at least roughly aligned ( typically within @xmath010 ; keeton , kochanek & falco 1998 ) . an important detail , though , is that the lens galaxy has a radially varying ellipticity and orientation ( bernstein et al .  1997 ) :",
    "the ellipticity increases from @xmath00.1 inside a radius of 1  to @xmath00.4 outside 10 , and the pa varies from @xmath040  to @xmath060  ( albeit with large uncertainties ) .",
    "these variations suggest that the galaxy s projected mass distribution may not have simple elliptical symmetry , and they may well need to be incorporated into lens models .      the host galaxy arcs act as an extensive set of position constraints that may break the degeneracy between the lens galaxy shape and the cluster shear .",
    "although the intrinsic source structure is unknown , the simplicity of the lensing geometry means that we can model the arcs self - consistently using a modified version of the ring cycle algorithm of kochanek et al .",
    "( 1989 ) . specifically , we know that there is a one - to - one mapping between the a image of the host galaxy and the source , so for a given lens model we can project the a arc back to the source plane to obtain the correct source structure for that lens model .",
    "we can then reproject that source onto the image plane to predict the structure of the b arc .",
    "since the arcs are very large compared to the size of the psf , there is no need to include the effects of the psf . for the arc map we use the smoothed residual image ( figure 1c ) .",
    "this technique produces maps of the model arcs that can be compared visually to the observed arcs ( see figures 24 below ) .",
    "however , for modeling we want to quantify the differences , so we define a @xmath56 term for the arcs using a pixel - by - pixel comparison of the observed and model surface brightnesses , @xmath57 the factor of 2 in the denominator enters because the source is constructed from arc a , so it and the observed b arc each have errorbars of @xmath58 . to compute @xmath59 we mask the arc map and use only the region near the b arc , omitting regions near the b quasar and the core of the lens galaxy where imperfect subtraction makes the residual flux unreliable .",
    "we also omit the region around the object g4 where the flux is not due to the quasar host galaxy ( see  2 ) .",
    "the masked region is shown in figure 1c . to count the number of arc constraints ,",
    "we count the number of pixels inside the mask for which either the observed arc or the model arc is more than @xmath60 above the sky and take this to be the number of arc constraints @xmath61 .",
    "typically @xmath62 .",
    "because the source is fully determined from the a arc , we quote @xmath63 as an effective @xmath64 for the arc .",
    "the fact that our best models produce @xmath65 ( see  5 ) suggests that this is a reasonable counting of the constraints .",
    "q  0957 + 561 has been modeled extensively ; we summarize results from the recent models by grogin & narayan ( 1996 ) , barkana et al.(1999 ) , bernstein & fischer ( 1999 ) , and chae ( 1999 ) in table 3 .",
    "( technical details of comparing the models are discussed in appendix a. ) the models fall into two main families based on how they treat the main lens galaxy .",
    "first is the `` power law '' family , in which the lens galaxy is modeled with a circular or elliptical surface density with a softened power law profile : @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is an ellipsoidal coordinate , @xmath68 is a core radius , and @xmath69 is the power law exponent such that @xmath70 asymptotically .",
    "the best - fit models typically have a small core radius and a power law @xmath71 corresponding to a profile slightly shallower than isothermal . in the second family ,",
    "called `` fgs '' models after being introduced by falco , gorenstein & shapiro ( 1991 ) , the lens galaxy is treated as a circular or elliptical king model , plus a central point mass to account for a mass deficit in the core of the king model .    in almost all of the previous models",
    "the lens galaxy was assumed to have a projected mass distribution with circular or elliptical symmetry .",
    "however , as discussed in ",
    " 3.1 and 3.2 the observed ellipticity gradient and isophote twist suggest that this assumption may not be correct .",
    "the key improvement in the models is the addition of internal structure in the lens galaxy s mass comparable to that seen in its light .",
    "while we do not expect the mass to trace the light exactly , it should be given the same freedoms in order to avoid oversimplifying the models .",
    "bernstein & fischer ( 1999 ) did add freedom to the galaxy s radial and angular structure by using independent power laws in different radial zones , but this led to unphysical models with density discontinuities that can not match normal rotation curves .",
    "we introduce models that allow similar radial and angular freedom while keeping the density smooth .",
    "we start with the pseudo - jaffe ellipsoid , whose projected density distribution has elliptical symmetry and a profile that is roughly flat inside a core radius @xmath68 , falls as @xmath72 out to a cut - off radius @xmath73 ( yielding a rotation curve that is approximately flat ) , and then falls as @xmath74 to maintain a finite mass ; a detailed definition is given in appendix b. we then construct `` double pseudo - jaffe '' models comprising two concentric pseudo - jaffe components with different scale lengths , ellipticities , and orientations .",
    "we fix the model galaxy to its observed position , which leaves 10 galaxy parameters : a mass parameter ( @xmath75 ) , ellipticity ( @xmath76 ) , orientation angle ( @xmath77 ) , core radius ( @xmath78 ) , and cut - off radius ( @xmath79 ) for each component ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the double pseudo - jaffe model provides a great deal of freedom in the lens galaxy .",
    "first , it is essentially a smooth generalization of both the power law and the fgs models .",
    "when the inner pseudo - jaffe component is compact , it mimics the point mass in fgs models while the outer component is similar to the king model ( see appendix b ) ; and when the cut - off radius of the inner component is comparable to the core radius of the outer component , the two components combine to produce nearly a smooth @xmath81 power law .",
    "second , with this model we can mimic the observed internal structure of the lens galaxy : by adjusting the ellipticities and orientations we can produce a smooth ellipticity gradient and isophote twist .",
    "an important difference from the broken power law models of bernstein & fischer ( 1999 ) is that the double pseudo - jaffe models have smooth density profiles .",
    "we discuss the physical properties of sample double pseudo - jaffe models in  5.3 .",
    "previous models have used several different methods for including the cluster s contribution to the lensing potential .",
    "the simplest approach is to expand the cluster potential in a taylor series and keep only the lowest significant ( 2nd order ) term , which describes the tidal shear produced by the cluster .",
    "however , this approximation is thought to be poor for q  0957 + 561 because the cluster is close to the lens and the vlbi errorbars are small , so the 3rd order terms are larger than the errorbars .",
    "barkana et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and chae ( 1999 ) included all the higher order terms implicitly by introducing a mass distribution to represent the cluster , but degeneracies related to the cluster shape and density profile forced them to make assumptions about the cluster properties .",
    "kochanek ( 1991 ) and bernstein & fischer ( 1999 ) instead used a taylor series with general 3rd order terms , @xmath82 the 2nd order @xmath54 term produces the mass sheet degeneracy , so it is usually omitted from the lens models and constrained independently ( see   3.1 and 3.2 ) .",
    "the 2nd order @xmath43 term represents the tidal shear from the cluster .",
    "the 3rd order @xmath83 and @xmath84 terms arise from the gradient of the cluster density and the @xmath85 component of the cluster mass ( in a frame centered on the lens galaxy ; see bernstein & fischer 1999 ; keeton 2000 ) .",
    "the three direction angles @xmath86 are written here as position angles ( i.e.  measured east of north ) .",

    "although we simply fit for the taylor series parameters , it is important to understand how they relate to physical properties of the cluster and what their reasonable ranges are .",
    "in popular cluster mass models the cluster amplitudes @xmath87 and direction angles @xmath86 have the following properties ( keeton 2000 ) :    * circularly symmetric mass distribution : the three angles all point to the center of the cluster . * singular isothermal ellipsoid : the shear angle @xmath44 points to the cluster center and the shear amplitude equals the convergence from the cluster , @xmath88 .",
    "both of these results hold for all positions and all values of the axis ratio @xmath89 .",
    "the gradient amplitude @xmath83 is bounded by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the distance from the lens galaxy to the cluster .",
    "* softened isothermal ellipsoid : outside of the core the results for the singular isothermal ellipsoid are approximately true .",

    "we let the shear and gradient parameters @xmath105 vary freely , but we keep these general relations in mind when interpreting the results .",
    "to avoid an explosion of parameters , we follow bernstein & fischer ( 1999 ) and use a `` restricted '' 3rd order cluster with @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( as for a singular isothermal sphere ) .",
    "this model is useful because it requires only four parameters for the cluster , and it can provide model - independent evidence for a non - circular cluster if @xmath108",
    ". we also experimented with models using a singular isothermal mass distribution for the cluster , and we discuss these models briefly but do not quote detailed results (  5 ) .",
    "our models have 10 galaxy and 4 cluster parameters , but fortunately we need not examine all of them explicitly .",
    "first , the general features of the lens allow us to fix two scale radii .",
    "the lack of a central image requires that the galaxy be nearly singular , so we set the core radius of the inner pseudo - jaffe component ( @xmath109 ) to zero . also , previous lens models suggest that the galaxy needs to have mass extending at least to the distant a image ( @xmath110 from the galaxy ) , so the cut - off radius of the outer pseudo - jaffe component ( @xmath111 ) should be larger than @xmath110",
    ". the model should not be very sensitive to any particular value larger than this , so we fix @xmath112 ( similar to bernstein & fischer 1999 ) .",
    "second , we can use linear techniques for the two galaxy mass parameters ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) and the two cluster amplitudes ( @xmath43 and @xmath83 ) because they enter the potential as simple multiplicative factors .",

    "the four constraint equations can be solved explicitly to write the four linear parameters as functions of the remaining ( non - linear ) parameters .",
    "this technique ensures that the vlbi constraints are fitted exactly , while reducing by four the number of parameters that must be examined directly .",
    "we are left with 8 explicit parameters : the ellipticities @xmath118 and @xmath119 , orientation angles @xmath120 and @xmath121 , and scale lengths @xmath122 and @xmath123 of the galaxy ; and the direction angles @xmath44 and @xmath124 of the cluster .",
    "we evaluate models in this parameter space using the remaining constraints : the flux ratios of the quasar cores and jets and the positions of the optical blobs and knots ( taken from bernstein & fischer 1999 ) , and the structure of the arcs ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "techniques and results for our new models are discussed in  5 .",
    "previous models of q  0957 + 561 ( summarized in table 3 ) posited that the vlbi observations and the optical blobs and knots provided strong enough constraints to break the degeneracy between the lens galaxy shape and the cluster shear . as we discussed in  3.1 , however , it is dangerous to use smooth circular or elliptical lens models with high - precision constraints , because the oversimplified models may be forced to converge on a best - fit solution with the wrong global structure for the potential .",
    "until now we have lacked the constraints to test this concern , although the fact that previous models gave wildly difference shapes for the lens galaxy certainly suggests that the models were not robust .",
    "the host galaxy arcs finally provide an extensive set of constraints for testing the previous models .",
    "the first clue comes from comparing the qualitative features of the arcs and the existing models . despite differences in details ,",
    "most of the previous models have a lensing potential with a strong tidal shear from the cluster ( @xmath125@xmath126 ) .",
    "the galaxy dominates the potential for the close image ( b ) , but the strong shear means that the cluster dominates the potential for the distant image ( a ) .",
    "the distinction is important because in general a round host galaxy produces an image distorted tangentially relative to the mass that dominates the potential . as a result , for a circular host galaxy most previous models of q  0957 + 561 would predict a b arc tangential to the galaxy ( as observed ) , and an a arc tangential to the cluster ",
    "i.e.stretched _ radially _ relative to the lens galaxy , opposite what is observed .",
    "these lens models can produce an a image tangential to the galaxy only if the source galaxy is highly flattened and oriented at just the right angle .",
    "in other words , we must either invoke a very special source configuration or conclude that the standard q  0957 + 561 models have generic problems .",
    "we can quantify these problems by using the arc modeling technique described in  3.3 to predict the structure of the b arc for each model and compare it to the observed b arc .",
    "( recall that this technique uses the observed a arc to construct the source , so models always reproduce the a arc correctly and hence are evaluated by examining the b arc . )",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the observed and predicted models arcs for previous power law models , while figure 4 shows the arcs for fgs models ; figure 5 shows the intrinsic source inferred for two of the models .",
    "table 3 includes the quantitative @xmath127 estimates for the models .",
    "all of these models are inconsistent with the structure of the b arc , both visually and in terms of @xmath127 .",
    "although the predicted arcs differ among the various models , there are two common features .",
    "first , in some of the models ( notably those with a circular lens galaxy ) the predicted b arc has a pair of bright ridges not seen in the observed b arc .",
    "models that produce such ridges are strongly inconsistent with the data ; they have @xmath127 statistics no better than 5.0 and as poor as 10.8 .",
    "second , the models generally fail to predict the correct shape for the b arc at low surface brightness levels .",
    "the predicted arcs have too much curvature and do not match the northeast extension of the observed arc . the failure to match even the rough shape ( extent and curvature ) of the b arc",
    "illustrates the point explained above : if the potential near the a image is dominated by the cluster shear , reproducing the a arc requires a flattened source ( e.g.  the barkana / spemd model in figure 5 ) that is distorted into a highly curved b arc .",
    "the existing models can not match the arcs better than @xmath128 , which given the large number of arc constraints means that these models are formally excluded at an extremely high significance level .",
    "the models arcs also illustrate a crucial limitation of the broken power law models of bernstein & fischer ( 1999 ) , represented here by the dm2+c2 model in figure 3 .",
    "these models use independent elliptical power law models in different radial zones to mimic the ellipticity and orientation variations in the observed lens galaxy .",
    "the problem is that the density is discontinuous across the zone boundary , which leads to a discontinuity in the predicted b arc .",
    "the discontinuity does not affect the quantitative @xmath127 statistic because it occurs outside our mask , but it is qualitatively unacceptable . combining this with the inability of the broken power law models to match normal rotation curves",
    "emphasizes that the models are physically unacceptable .",
    "the need for a more physically reasonable way to include ellipticity and orientation variations motivates our introduction of the double pseudo - jaffe models .",
    "although the previous models do not correctly reproduce the distortions of the host galaxy , they do reveal a model - independent qualitative feature of the lensing .",
    "part of the quasar host galaxy is doubly - imaged like the quasar , but a small region crosses the lensing caustic and is quadruply - imaged ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "arc a is a single distorted image of the host galaxy , but arc b is a combination of the three remaining images of the quadruply - imaged and the one remaining image of the doubly - imaged region .",
    "this fact explains why the a and b arcs have such different geometries .",
    "it also implies that with the current observations of the arcs , most of the constraints come from the small region of the host galaxy that is quadruply - imaged .",
    "a deeper image of the arcs should reveal a complete einstein ring that would strengthen the constraints by using more of the host galaxy ( see  6 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the host galaxy arcs in q  0957 + 561 offer a strong new probe of the global shape of the lensing potential , and they show that existing lens models converged to the wrong potential .",
    "generically , the previous models have too much shear from the cluster . the failure to fit the arcs",
    "is a common problem of models that combine strong constraints from the sub - milli - arcsecond structure of the quasar jets with oversimplified circular or elliptical lens models .",
    "it rules out existing models of the system , together with the bounds on @xmath2 drawn from them .",
    "two goals motivate our search for new models of q  0957 + 561 . first",
    ", if we want to use the vlbi constraints with sub - milli - arcsecond precision , we must be sensitive to details of the lens galaxy structure such as its radially varying ellipticity and orientation .",
    "we used double pseudo - jaffe models ( see  3.4 ) to incorporate such structure in a smooth and physically reasonable way .",
    "second , we want to incorporate the powerful constraints from the host galaxy arcs into the modeling process , instead of using them for _ a posteriori _ tests as in  4 . in this way we hope to break the environment degeneracy in a robust way .",
    "when we began to examine new models we found a range of solutions consistent with the data , so we adopted monte carlo techniques to sample this range . in this section",
    "we first describe the monte carlo techniques (  5.1 ) , and then discuss the models and their implications for breaking the degeneracy between the galaxy and cluster (  5.2 ) , the physical properties of the lens galaxy and cluster (  5.3 ) , and the hubble constant (  5.4 ) .      to explore our model space , we picked random values for the non - linear model parameters , using restricted but physically - motivated ranges :    * galaxy ellipticity : there are no successful models with an outer ellipticity below 0.3",
    ". we believed models with an ellipticity larger than @xmath129 to be implausible .",
    "hence we considered @xmath130 for the outer ellipticity . in models with an ellipticity gradient",
    "the inner ellipticity can be small , so we considered @xmath131 . *",
    "galaxy orientation : in the observed lens galaxy the pa varies from @xmath040  to @xmath060  ( bernstein et al .  1997 ) .",
    "we expect the mass to be roughly aligned with the light ( to within @xmath010 ; keeton et al .",
    "1998 ) , so we considered @xmath132 for the inner and outer position angles .",
    "* galaxy scale lengths : we fixed the inner pseudo - jaffe component to be singular ( @xmath133 ) and the outer component to have a cut - off radius @xmath112 ( see  3.6 ) . for the cut - off radius of the inner component ( @xmath122 ) and the core radius of the outer component ( @xmath123 ) we considered @xmath134 . *",
    "cluster direction angles : galaxy counts and the weak lensing measurement suggest that the cluster has its mass concentration toward @xmath135 ( fischer et al .",
    "1997 ) . for reasonable cluster models the shear angle",
    "@xmath44 points roughly to the cluster center ( see  3.5 ) , so we considered shear angles in the range @xmath136 .",
    "we were less restrictive with the gradient angle @xmath124 and required only that it be in the same quadrant as the cluster , @xmath137 .",
    "given values for these parameters , we fixed the four remaining parameters ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath43 , @xmath83 ) using the constraints from the quasar core and jet positions ( see  3.6 ) .",
    "our limited parameter ranges may omit some models that are formally consistent with the data , but they span what we expect for physically reasonable models .",
    "we tabulated models that fit the data at the 95% confidence level . with @xmath138 constraints",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath139 ( e.g.  press et al .",
    "1992 ,   6.2 and 15.6 ) .",
    "we applied these thresholds to the constraints from the quasars and the optical blobs and knots both separately and jointly : we required @xmath140 for the flux ratios of the quasar cores and jets ( 2 constraints ) , @xmath141 for the positions of the optical blobs and knots ( 4 constraints ) , and @xmath142 for the 6 joint constraints .",
    "we did not impose constraints from the less reliable blob and knot flux ratios .",
    "we considered different thresholds for the arc constraints , as discussed below .",
    "note that it was not useful to combine all the constraints into a total @xmath64 because the number of constraints from the arcs is so large .",
    "the monte carlo technique is not especially efficient ; we examined @xmath143 models and found of order 1000 models consistent with the data . however , examining that many models is not prohibitively time consuming .",
    "most of the models can be ruled out quickly because they fail the flux and blob / knot @xmath56 cuts .",
    "for the remaining models , we first computed a fast @xmath127 using a 4 times undersampled arc map ; only for promising models did we compute @xmath127 using the full arc map .",
    "the benefit of this brute force approach is the ability to identify and sample the wide range of models consistent with the data , and thereby estimate the full range of possible @xmath2 values .",
    "we first considered models in which the inner and outer components of the model galaxy were fixed to have the same ellipticity and orientation ; we found @xmath144 models with @xmath145 , whose properties are summarized in figure 6 .",
    "next we allowed the inner and outer galaxy components to have different shapes , mimicking ellipticity and orientation gradients . for simplicity",
    ", we refer to such models as having a `` twist , '' even though that term formally describes only an orientation gradient .",
    "we found @xmath146 twist models with @xmath147 , whose properties are summarized in figure 7 .",
    "table 4 gives parameters and figure 8 shows the predicted arcs for sample models of both types .",
    "we note that the number of successful models with a twist is smaller than the number of successful models without a twist . introducing the twist",
    "enlarges the parameter space without necessarily increasing the space of successful models by the same amount ; hence sampling the same total number of models yields fewer acceptable models . in the following sections we discuss models with @xmath148 , but our conclusions would not change substantially if we lowered this threshold .",
    "the host galaxy arcs finally break the degeneracy between the lens galaxy shape and the cluster shear in q  0957 + 561 .",
    "first , they constrain the lens galaxy shape . among the previous models , the three with the best fits to the arcs have @xmath149 ( table 3 ) . in the new models , the bounds on the ( outer ) orientation of the lens galaxy are @xmath150 in models without a twist ( figure 6d ) and @xmath151 in models with a twist ( figure 7f ) .",
    "these ranges are consistent with the observed galaxy s orientation of about @xmath152 ( bernstein et al .",
    "in other words , the arcs not only constrain the model galaxy s orientation , they require that its mass distribution be at least roughly aligned with the light distribution ; such alignment is also seen in other lens systems ( keeton et al .",
    "also , in the new models the bounds on the ( outer ) ellipticity of the galaxy are @xmath153 in models without a twist ( figure 6c ) and @xmath154 in models with a twist ( figure 7e ) .",
    "these ranges are slightly higher than the ellipticity seen in the outer parts of the galaxy ( bernstein et al .",
    "1997 ) , but there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect the ellipticities of the dark halo and the light to be similar . these constraints on the lens galaxy shape span models with a wide range of lens galaxy mass profiles ( controlled by the scale radii @xmath122 and @xmath123 ;",
    "see figures 6b and 7b ) , ellipticity profiles ( with or without a twist ) , and cluster contributions .",
    "thus we believe that they are robust , and that the ability of the host galaxy arcs to finally constrain the galaxy shape is the most important result of our new models .",
    "second , the arcs place limits on the lensing contribution of the cluster .",
    "the new models have moderate or even small cluster shears ( typically @xmath155 ; figures 6e and 7 g ) , which contrasts with the strong shears in previous models .",
    "a small shear is required by the fact that both arcs are tangential to the lens galaxy ( see  4 ) . also , including the 3rd order cluster term is important , as expected from the proximity of the cluster to the lens ( kochanek 1991 ) .",
    "most models have a cluster gradient amplitude in the range @xmath156 ( figures 6 g and 7i ) , so at the position of image a the 3rd order term is comparable to or even larger than the 2nd order term ( see eq .  [",
    "eq : phiclus ] ) . because the cluster amplitudes are small , the corresponding direction angles @xmath44 and @xmath124 are poorly constrained ( figures 6f , 6h , 7h , and 7j ) .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that they usually differ implies that the cluster can not be spherical ( see  3.5 ) .    unfortunately , even the arcs can not uniquely determine the model .",
    "first , the cluster angles can adjust to accommodate the narrow but finite range of lens galaxies given above .",
    "second , in models with a twist the inner component can take on all values of ellipticity and orientation in the ranges we allowed ( figures 7c and 7d ) .",
    "this is because the inner component is usually compact , so like the point mass in fgs lens models it serves mainly to correct a central mass deficit and the model is largely insensitive to the distribution of that mass .",
    "both of these degeneracies affect the potential enough to produce a disappointingly wide range of hubble constant values ( see  5.4 ) .",
    "these conclusions are drawn from models using a taylor series for the cluster potential .",
    "we also examined models treating the cluster using an elongated isothermal model with an arbitrary position , axis ratio , and orientation .",
    "the above conclusions about the galaxy properties still pertain , with one modification : in models with a twist the distribution of outer orientation angles gains a tail down to @xmath157 .",
    "the above conclusions about the cluster contributions also hold , except that the new bounds on the shear amplitude are @xmath158 . since an isothermal cluster has @xmath159 , it is hard to obtain a small shear without essentially eliminating the cluster .",
    "we introduced the double pseudo - jaffe models in order to smoothly include ellipticity and orientation variations in the lens galaxy , but we must ask whether the models are physically plausible . figure 9 shows the estimated density and circular velocity profiles for the models in table 4 .",
    "these profiles are only estimates because they require the full 3-d mass distribution , while lens models give only the projected distribution .",
    "we assumed that the intrinsic distributions are oblate spheroids viewed edge - on , and we computed the density and circular velocity profiles in the equatorial plane , neglecting any twist .",
    "the high inferred circular velocities ( @xmath160 ) are misleading , because our models omit any convergence from the cluster and @xmath161 , and because converting to an observed velocity dispersion involves systematic uncertainties in the stellar dynamics ( see romanowsky & kochanek 1999 ) .",
    "the qualitative features , however , are plausible .",
    "the inner and outer galaxy components generally combine to produce a rotation curve that is approximately flat , although in several models it turns up at small radii because the inner component of the pseudo - jaffe models is compact .",
    "this effect , which also appears in fgs models because of the point mass , occurs because lensing constrains only the total mass enclosed by the b image ( @xmath162 ) , and if that mass is compact then it produces a rising rotation curve .",
    "we conclude that the fitted double pseudo - jaffe models are fairly reasonable .    as for the cluster , recall that the host galaxy arcs require the shear to be small . at the same time",
    ", two independent estimates of the cluster mass suggest that the convergence from the cluster is @xmath163 .",
    "first , stellar dynamical modeling of the lens galaxy constrains its mass such that explaining the image separation requires a cluster convergence of @xmath164 ( romanowsky & kochanek 1999 ) .",
    "second , fischer et al .  ( 1997 ) and bernstein & fischer ( 1999 ) used weak lensing to measure the total mass inside an aperture centered on the lens galaxy . subtracting the mass of a model lens galaxy then gives a model - dependent estimate of the remaining cluster mass ( see eq .  [ eq : kc ] ) . with this technique",
    "all of our models yield @xmath165 .",
    "these results are surprising because with popular cluster models it is difficult to produce a shear that is much smaller than the convergence ( keeton 2000 ) .",
    "specifically , with a singular isothermal ellipsoid , @xmath166 for all cluster positions , orientations , and axis ratios .",
    "introducing a core radius allows @xmath167 , but the shear is substantially smaller than the convergence only if the lens galaxy is near or within the cluster core . if the cluster halo has the `` universal '' or nfw density profile ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 ) , @xmath168 only inside @xmath169 , where @xmath100 is the nfw scale length .",
    "for the observed cluster at redshift @xmath9 with a velocity dispersion of @xmath0700 ( angonin - willaime et al .",
    "1994 ) , the nfw scale length would be @xmath170 @xmath171 kpc or @xmath172 ( e.g.  navarro et al .",
    "1996 ) . combining these results with the estimates of the cluster contribution ( @xmath173 or even @xmath174 , and @xmath163 ) suggests two possible conclusions about the cluster . on the one hand ,",
    "if the cluster is ellipsoidal it must have a core or scale radius large enough to encompass the galaxy .",
    "having the lens galaxy be in the cluster core would not be too surprising since it is the brightest galaxy in the cluster .",
    "on the other hand , the assumption of an ellipsoidal model for the cluster may not be correct , perhaps because of substructure .      finally , we want to combine the lens models and the observed time delay and use eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdel ] ) to determine the hubble constant @xmath2 .",
    "as discussed in  3.1 , the inferred value of @xmath2 depends weakly on the other cosmological parameters ; we quote results assuming @xmath175 and @xmath176 and note that they would increase by 5.8% ( 4.5% ) for an @xmath177 open ( flat ) cosmology .",
    "also , the mass sheet degeneracy implies @xmath178 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : hk ] ) , and @xmath54 can not be constrained by lens models . thus if we write @xmath179 , lensing directly measures only the combination @xmath180 , which is what we quote in tables 3 and 4 and figures 6 and 7 .",
    "we need an independent estimate of @xmath54 in order to constrain @xmath2 itself .",
    "we saw in  5.2 that the host galaxy arcs help break the degeneracy between the lens galaxy shape and the cluster shear , but they do not eliminate it entirely . the remaining freedom in the models is small in terms of the properties of the lens galaxy but large in terms of the hubble constant .",
    "models without a twist yield @xmath181 , with a tail down to @xmath182 ( figure 6 ) . allowing a twist in the lens galaxy",
    "broadens the distribution down to @xmath183 ( figure 7 ) .",
    "in other words , within the lens models there is a @xmath184 variation in inferred values for the hubble constant ; this is independent of uncertainties in @xmath54 .",
    "most of this variation is related to a strong correlation between the lens galaxy ellipticity and the hubble constant ( figures 6c , 7c , and 7e ) : flatter galaxies have deeper central potential wells when normalized to produce the same images .",
    "although the model uncertainties limit our ability to use q  0957 + 561 to constrain the hubble constant , we might invert our thinking and ask what properties of the lens model are required to be consistent with local distance ladder determinations of @xmath2 ( e.g.  mould et al .",
    "1999 ) . assuming a cluster convergence @xmath163 ( see  5.3 ) , obtaining @xmath185  requires a lens galaxy that is relatively round in the center ( @xmath186 ) and moderately flattened in the outer parts ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "these bounds bolster the suggestion that the lens galaxy must have a mass distribution with an ellipticity gradient fairly similar to that seen in the light distribution .",
    "we have detected large , distorted images of the quasar host galaxy in the gravitational lens q  0957 + 561 . in the h band ( rest frame r )",
    ", the host galaxy appears as two long ( @xmath05 ) arcs stretched tangentially relative to the lens galaxy .",
    "previously published models of q  0957 + 561 fail to predict the correct shape for the host galaxy arcs .",
    "this failure rules out those models and any conclusions about the value of the hubble constant drawn from them .",
    "the problem with the previous models is that they oversimplified the mass distribution for the lens galaxy , so they had to adjust the large - scale features of the model ( the galaxy shape and the cluster shear ) in order to fit small - scale constraints ( the vlbi jets , with @xmath00.1 milli - arcsecond errorbars ) . without strong constraints on the global shape of the lensing potential ,",
    "each class of models happily converged to a best - fit solution with the wrong global structure .",
    "the failure of these models presents two important lessons ( also see kochanek 1991 ; bernstein et al .",
    "1993 ; mao & schneider 1998 ; bernstein & fischer 1999 ) .",
    "first , when the constraints are extremely precise it is necessary to include the full complexity of the structure of the lens galaxy .",
    "second , it is important to carefully explore the full range of possible models before leaping to conclusions about the value of the hubble constant and its uncertainties .",
    "two improvements are crucial to finding better models .",
    "first , the host galaxy arcs finally provide enough constraints to separately determine both the lens galaxy shape and the cluster shear , and they must be incorporated into the modeling process .",
    "second , models for the lens galaxy must allow internal structure similar to that seen in the observed galaxy , which for q  0957 + 561 means a radially varying ellipticity and orientation .",
    "although the mass need not exactly trace the light , it must be given the same freedoms lest we oversimplify the models .",
    "we introduced a new class of lens models , the double pseudo - jaffe models , that smoothly incorporate an ellipticity gradient and isophote twist .",
    "our models lead to several new conclusions about the system .",
    "first , the shape of the lens galaxy s mass distribution must be surprisingly similar to the shape of its luminosity distribution .",
    "the mass distribution must be moderately flattened and roughly aligned with the light distribution .",
    "such alignment between the mass and the light is also seen in other gravitational lenses ( keeton et al .",
    "1998 ) , but was not seen in previous models of q  0957 + 561 .",
    "second , the shear from the cluster must be small ( @xmath173 ) , in marked contrast with the moderate or strong shears seen in previous models ( @xmath125@xmath126 ) .",
    "the small shear combined with an estimated convergence @xmath163 implies that the cluster potential must be approximately centered on the lens galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , the current observations of the host galaxy can not fully determine the lens model .",
    "there are still freedoms related to several direction angles that describe the cluster and to the amplitudes of the ellipticity and orientation gradients , and they leave a 25% uncertainty in the inferred value of the hubble constant .    however , there are two promising prospects for further improving the constraints on this systems .",
    "first , the substantial progress we have found is based on a 2800-second h band image .",
    "a deeper image with a refurbished nicmos camera should show a complete einstein ring image .",
    "since an einstein ring probes the potential all the way around the lens galaxy , it is extremely useful for determining both the lens model and the intrinsic shape of the host galaxy ( see keeton , kochanek & mcleod 2000 ) .",
    "filling in the gaps in the q  0957 + 561 ring should eliminate the remaining uncertainties in the models .",
    "second , x - rays from the cluster gas have been detected ( chartas et al .",
    "1998 ) , but the image resolution was poor and the signal was dominated by x - rays from the quasar images .",
    "new high - resolution x - ray observations to map the cluster gas would constrain the cluster potential and help determine the cluster angles that are still unknown ( namely the angle to the cluster center and the angle of the cluster s density gradient at the lens ) . combining deeper infrared and x - ray imaging",
    "would thus dramatically improve the constraints on the models and allow consistency checks of the cluster potential .",
    "improved x - ray imaging would also further improve the mass estimates of the cluster for breaking the mass sheet degeneracy .",
    "distorted images of the host galaxy have now been observed in four of the time delay lenses ( q  0957 + 561 , pg  1115 + 080 , b  1600 + 434 , and b  1608 + 656 ; see impey et al .",
    "1998 ; kochanek et al .",
    "as we have illustrated , images of the host galaxy are a powerful constraint on models of the system and hence on the uncertainties in the value of @xmath2 derived from the time delay measurements",
    ". to date , host galaxies have been thought of mainly as pleasant bonuses in relatively shallow images targeting the lens galaxies .",
    "taking full advantage of the host galaxies will require deeper images focused on the host galaxies themselves .",
    "such images hold great promise for breaking common degeneracies in lens models and allowing gravitational lensing to map in detail the mass distributions of distant galaxies , to probe the potentials of lens galaxy environments , and to determine a robust and independent measurement of the hubble constant at cosmological distances .",

    "sorting out the differences can be confusing , so we converted all the results to a standard form and explain the conversions here .",
    "first , bernstein & fischer ( 1999 ) and chae ( 1999 ) quoted an ellipticity parameter @xmath188 that is related to the axis ratio @xmath89 by @xmath189 .",
    "we report the true ellipticity @xmath190 .",
    "( bernstein & fischer called their ellipticity parameter @xmath191 , but it played the same role as @xmath188 here . )    second , different authors quoted results for the hubble constant in different ways . in general , lens models can determine only the combination @xmath180 where @xmath192 and @xmath193 is the surface mass density of the cluster ( in critical units ) at the position of the lens .",
    "models that use a multipole expansion for the cluster ( an external shear or 3rd order cluster , see eq .",
    "[ eq : phiclus ] ) offer no constraints on @xmath54 .",
    "models that use an actual mass distribution for the cluster do predict @xmath54 : an isothermal sphere that has core radius @xmath68 and is located a distance @xmath194 from the lens produces @xmath195 and shear @xmath196 $ ] , where @xmath197 and @xmath198 is a mass parameter such that @xmath199 .",
    "however , the @xmath54 prediction is not unique because varying the cluster s shape and profile can change @xmath54 ( and @xmath200 ) without changing the goodness of fit ( see chae 1999 for examples ) .",
    "hence we describe these cluster models in terms of an equivalent external shear with magnitude @xmath201 ( see grogin & narayan 1996 ; barkana et al .",
    "1999 ) . in table 3",
    "we quote the magnitude of the external shear ( @xmath43 , or @xmath202 in the isothermal sphere cluster models ) and the hubble constant combination @xmath180 .",
    "we note that if the cluster is a singular isothermal sphere , @xmath203 ( see barkana et al.1999 ) .",
    "the estimates of @xmath180 can be translated into actual estimates for @xmath2 using the weak lensing measurement of the cluster mass ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "third , different authors used slightly different definitions of @xmath56 .",
    "we did _ not _ convert @xmath56 values ; we used what the authors reported .",
    "finally , we corrected several apparent typographical errors .",
    "barkana et al .",
    "( 1999 ) claimed that their galaxy orientation angle @xmath204 was a position angle , but in fact the position angle was @xmath205 and this is what we quote .",

    "their formalism is self - consistent , except that their eq .",
    "( 16 ) needs a minus sign in front of the @xmath43 term .",
    "we report the bernstein & fischer ( 1999 ) angles as position angles .",
    "finally , for the bernstein & fischer ( 1999 ) 3rd order cluster models there appears to be a difference of a factor of 2 between the amplitude of 3rd order cluster term as written in their eq .",
    "( 16 ) and as reported in their table 3 .",

    "a standard jaffe ( 1983 ) model has a 3-dimensional density distribution @xmath207 where @xmath67 is an ellipsoidal coordinate and @xmath73 is the break radius . for lensing it",
