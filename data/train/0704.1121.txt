    "if @xmath3 is a factor with a finite group @xmath10 acting by outer automorphisms , then @xmath11 , the algebra of fixed points of the action , is an irreducible subfactor of @xmath3 with index equal to the order of @xmath10 .",
    "it is well known that in this case the intermediate subalgebras @xmath12 are precisely the fixed point algebras of the subgroups of @xmath10 @xcite .    in this spirit",
    "one thinks of the classification of intermediate subfactors as a `` noncommutative galois theory '' .",
    "motivated by von neumann s study of projection lattices in hilbert space as a `` continuous geometry '' , watatani proposed studying lattices of intermediate subfactors , which are finite for irreducible finite - index inclusions , as a quantization @xcite .",
    "sano and watatani introduced the notion of angles between subfactors , a numerical invariant which measures the degree of noncommutativity of pairs of subfactors @xcite .",
    "a major step towards the classification of intermediate subfactors was bisch s characterization of intermediate subfactors as _ biprojections _ in planar algebras- elements of the standard invariant which are projections in both of the dual algebraic structures @xcite .",
    "bisch and jones then described a generic construction of intermediate subfactors by constructing a universal planar algebra generated by a single biprojection , the fuss - catalan algebra with parameters corresponding to the indices @xcite .",
    "these intermediate subfactors are _ supertransitive _ in the sense that the standard invariants are minimal .",
    "it was hoped that a similar generic planar algebra for multiple intermediate subfactors could be described in terms of indices and invariants such as angles . indeed",
    ", a tensor product does yield a generic construction of commuting pairs of intermediate subfactors , but constructing pairs with nontrivial angles has proven more difficult . in @xcite , jones and the first - named author showed that there are essentially only @xmath13 examples of noncommuting irreducible quadrilaterals of factors such that all of the elementary inclusions are supertransitive .",
    "one is a quadrilateral of subgroups of the symmetric group @xmath14 and the other comes from the ghj family of subfactors and all the elementary inclusions have index @xmath15 .",
    "it is known that the structure of an intermediate subfactor @xmath16 is determined by the relationship between the two systems of @xmath1-@xmath1 bimodules arising from @xmath7 and @xmath5 ( see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "after @xcite appeared , the second - named author gave a short proof of the above mentioned result using simple computation of @xmath17 bimodules ( see remark [ 4remrak no - extra ] ) .",
    "it turns out from the proof that the assumption in @xcite is too restrictive from the view point of bimodules . therefore to capture more interesting and general structure , one should relax the assumption of supertransitivity .",
    "indeed , the first named author @xcite recently obtained a complete classification result of irreducible non - commuting quadrilaterals with @xmath7 and @xmath8 isomorphic to the jones subfactor of index less than 4 ( without posing any assumption on @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) and showed that a series of such quadrilaterals exists .    in this paper we investigate quadrilaterals whose elementary inclusions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are each 2-supertransitive ( an inclusion @xmath18 is 2-supertransitive if the complement of @xmath19 in the @xmath20 bimodule decomposition of @xmath21 is irreducible . ) in this case the systems of @xmath22 bimodules for @xmath23 and for @xmath24 are each generated by a single irreducible @xmath17 bimodule , and the question is how these two bimodules are related .",
    "a key tool in this analysis is the notion of second cohomology for subfactors , introduced by the second named author and kosaki in @xcite , which counts the inner conjugacy classes of subfactors sharing the same basic extension ( as a bimodule class ) . for a quadrilateral with @xmath25 and @xmath26 2-supertransitive ,",
    "noncommutativity is equivalent to the existence of an @xmath27 bimodule isomorphism from @xmath1 to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath25 ( dual ) has trivial second cohomology , this @xmath27 bimodule isomorphism can actually be realized as an algebra isomorhism .",
    "in particular they showed that any 3-supertransitive subfactor has trivial second cohomology .",
    "ultimately this leads to a classification of noncommuting quadrilaterals whose elementary subfactors are 2-supertransitive with trivial second cohomology into two basic types : those which are not cocommuting ( `` cocommuting '' means that the quadrilateral of commutants is a commuting square ) and have @xmath28=[p : n ] $ ] , like the @xmath29 example , and those which are cocommuting and have @xmath28=[p : n]-1 $ ] , like the @xmath30 example .",
    "the latter type is further subdivided according to the galois group of @xmath0 , which must be a subgroup of @xmath30 . in the case that the elementary subfactors have index less than or equal to @xmath31",
    "we examine all the possibilities and arrive at the following result .",
    "there are exactly seven noncommuting irreducible quadrilaterals of hyperfinite ii@xmath32 factors whose elementary inclusions all have indices less than or equal to @xmath33 , up to conjugacy .    if @xmath34 are the principal graphs of the elementary subfactors , the possible configurations are :    @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37    the fully supertransitive cases are @xmath38 , which is the @xmath39 example , and @xmath40 , which is the @xmath30 example , and all other cases have some extra structure .",
    "the new examples include a noncocommuting quadrilateral whose elementary subfactors have index @xmath31 @xmath41 , a cocommuting quadrilateral whose indices are @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath44 , and several cocommuting quadrilaterals arising from group actions .",
    "note that any quadrilateral is either noncommuting , noncocommuting ( and hence dual to a noncommuting quadrilateral ) , or else is both commuting and cocommuting , in which case there is no obstruction to the choices of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is also interesting to study such quadrilaterals with larger indices .",
    "in fact the exotic haagerup subfactor appears as an elementary subfactor with maximal supertransitivity in both types of quadrilaterals and the asaeda - haagerup subfactor may appear as well .",
    "it is still unknown how many examples there are of the various types of quadrilaterals ( although there is an infinite series of cocommuting quadrilaterals with 3-supertransitive elementary subfactors , coming from symmetric group actions . )",
    "second cohomolgy also turns out to be closely related to angles . for a noncommuting quadrilateral with @xmath45 and @xmath26 2-supertransitive",
    ", there are at most two possibilities for the angle for each cohomolgy class of @xmath25 ( dual ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath45 is 3-supertransitive , the angle is always @xmath47 - 1 ) $ ] .",
    "we also compute the angles in quadrilaterals arising from @xmath48-induction ( which are identified with the ghj pairs of @xcite ) and asymptotic inclusions , the former of which includes the forked temperley - lieb quadrilaterals of @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    section 2 sets forth the basic notation of quadrilaterals , sectors and q - systems which are used throughout .",
    "we often deal with infinite factors since we are actually studying properties of the standard invariant .",
    "section 3 studies the relationship between second cohomology for subfactors and angles .",
    "section 4 proves that quadrilaterals whose elementary subfactors are 2-supertransitive with trivial second cohomology fall into the two basic types discussed above , and that for the cocommuting type the galois group of the total inclusion is a subgroup of @xmath30 .",
    "section 5 analyzes several classes of quadrilaterals according to the results of the previous section and for each class provides an example with maximal supertransitivity .",
    "section 6 classifies all noncommuting irreducible quadrilaterals whose elementary subfactors have indices less than or equal to 4",
    ".    section 7 computes the angles for quadrilaterals coming from @xmath9-induction and asymptotic inclusions .",
    "the appendix constructs a q - system from a sector in the haagerup principal graph and shows that it is unique , filling in a gap for one of the examples in section 5 .",
