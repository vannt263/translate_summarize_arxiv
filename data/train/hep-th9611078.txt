    "the dependence of physical quantities on the number of dimensions is of considerable interest @xcite . in particular , by expanding in the number of dimensions one can obtain nonperturbative information about the coupling constant @xcite .",

    "specifically , we studied the casimir stress ( the stress on the sphere is equal to the casimir force per unit area multiplied by the area of the sphere ) that is due to quantum fluctuations of a free massless scalar field satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions on the shell .",
    "that is , the green s functions satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath4 here , following the suggestion of @xcite , we calculate the tm modes ( for which @xmath5 ) in the same situation .",
    "the tm modes are modes which satisfy mixed boundary conditions on the surface @xcite , @xmath6 as opposed to the te modes ( for which @xmath7 ) , which satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions ( [ tebc ] ) on the surface , and are equivalent to the scalar modes found in @xcite .",

    "then , the casimir stress is computed from the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum - stress tensor , expressed as derivatives of the green s functions .",
    "the resulting expression for the casimir stress on a @xmath0-dimensional spherical shell takes the form of an infinite sum of integrals over modified bessel functions ; the dimension @xmath0 appears explicitly as well as in the orders of the bessel functions . by combining the results for the tm modes found here with those for the te modes found earlier @xcite",

    "the calculation given in this paper for the casimir stress on a spherical shell follows very closely the green s function technique described in @xcite , and we will therefore be concise , and emphasize the significant differences .      the two - point green s function @xmath14 satisfies the inhomogeneous klein - gordon equation @xmath15 subject to the boundary condition ( [ tmbc ] ) on the surface @xmath16 .",

    "then , we can multiply the quantity in the logarithm in ( [ qn ] ) by an arbitrary power of @xmath99 without changing the value for the force for @xmath8 . we choose that multiplicative factor to be @xmath102 because then a simple asymptotic analysis shows that the integrals converge . then , we analytically continue the resulting expression to all @xmath0 .",

    "there were actually two procedures which were used to turn the corresponding sum in the scalar case into a convergent series , and to extract numerical results , although only one of those procedures was described in the paper @xcite . in that procedure , we subtract from the summand the leading terms in the @xmath107 expansion , derived from ( [ asym ] ) , identifying those summed subtractions with riemann zeta functions : @xmath108\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mbox{}+{\\pi\\over\\gamma(d-1)}\\left[\\zeta(1-d ) + \\sum_{k=1}^{k+1 } b_k\\zeta(k+1-d ) -b_{k+1}\\sum_{n=1}^n n^{d - k-2}\\right]\\bigg\\}. \\label{zetareg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath109 are the coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of the summand in ( [ casforce ] ) , of which the first two are    @xmath110    in ( [ zetareg ] ) we keep @xmath111 terms in the asymptotic expansion , and , after @xmath112 terms in the sum , we approximate the subtracted integrand by the next term in the large @xmath70 expansion .",
    "the series converges for @xmath113 , so more and more terms in the asymptotic expansion are required as @xmath0 increases .",
    "there is a second method which gives identical results , and is , in fact , more convergent .",
    "the results given in @xcite were , in fact , first computed by this procedure , which is based on analytic continuation in dimension . here , we simply subtract from @xmath100 the first two terms in the asymptotic expansion ( [ asym ] ) , and then argue , as a generalization of ( [ cont ] ) , that @xmath114 therefore , by continuing from negative dimension , we argue that we can make the subtraction without introducing any additional terms .",
    "thus , if we define @xmath115 we have @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the coefficient of @xmath118 in ( [ asym ] ) . the last sum in ( [ secapprox ] ) can be evaluated according to @xmath119 the approximation given in ( [ secapprox ] ) converges for @xmath120 .",
    "the case of integers @xmath121 is of special note , because , for those cases , the series truncates .",
    "for example , for @xmath122 only the @xmath11 , @xmath123 terms appear , where the integrals cancel by virtue of the symmetry of bessel functions , @xmath124 for @xmath70 an integer . however , using the first procedure ( [ zetareg ] ) , we have a residual zeta function contribution : @xmath125 because both @xmath126 and @xmath127 have simple poles , with residue @xmath128 , at @xmath122 . this result for @xmath122 is the negative of the result found in the scalar case , ( 3.22 ) of @xcite , which is a direct consequence of the fact that the @xmath129 term in the asymptotic expansion cancels when the te and tm modes are combined [ compare ( [ b1 ] ) with the corresponding term in ( 3.23 ) of @xcite . ] the continuation in @xmath0 method gives the same result , because then @xmath130 where a limiting procedure , @xmath131 , is employed to deal with the singularity which occurs for @xmath132 , where @xmath133 .    for the negative even integers we achieve a similar cancellation between pairs of integers , with no zeta function residual because the @xmath134 functions no longer have poles there . for example , for @xmath135 we have @xmath136 because @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "again , the other method of regularization gives the same result when a careful limit is taken .",
    "for odd integer @xmath121 , trucation occurs without cancellation , because @xmath139 .",
    "for example , for @xmath82 , @xmath140      we have used both methods described above to extract numerical results for the stress on a sphere due to tm fluctuations in the interior and exterior .",
    "results are plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "salient features are the following :    * as in the scalar case , poles occur for positive even dimension . *",
    "the integrals become complex for @xmath141 because the function @xmath105 , ( [ fofx ] ) , occurring in the logarithm develops zeros .",
    "( this phenomenon started at @xmath122 for the scalar case . )",
    "correspondingly , there are logarithmic singularities , and cusps , occurring at @xmath123 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath128 , @xmath103 ,  , rather than just at the nonpositive even integers .",
    "* the sign of the casimir force changes dramatically with dimension . here",
    "this is even more striking than in the scalar case , where the sign was constant between the poles for @xmath144 . for the tm modes",
    ", the casimir force vanishes for @xmath145 , being repulsive for @xmath146 and attractive for @xmath147 .",
    "* also in fig .  1 ,",
    "the results found here are compared with those found in the scalar or te case , @xcite .",
    "the correspondence is quite remarkable .",
    "in particular , for @xmath141 the qualitative structure of the curves are very similar when the scale of the dimensions in the te case is reduced by a factor of 2 ; that is , the interval @xmath148 in the te case corresponds to the interval @xmath149 in the tm , @xmath150 for te corresponds to @xmath151 for tm , etc . * physically , the most interesting result is at @xmath10 .",
    "the tm mode calculated here has the value @xmath152 .",
    "however , if we wish to compare this to the electrodynamic result @xcite , we must subtract off the @xmath11 mode , which is given in terms of the integral @xmath153 , which displays the accuracy of our numerical integration . similarly removing the @xmath11 mode ( @xmath154 ) from the result quoted in ( 3.24 ) of @xcite , @xmath155 ,",
    "gives agreement with the familiar result @xcite : @xmath156    to conclude , this paper adds one more example to our collection of known results concerning the dimensional and boundary dependence of the casimir effect .",
    "unfortunately , we are no closer to understanding intuitively the sign of the phenomenon .",
    "i thank the us department of energy for financial support .",
    "i am grateful to a. romeo , y. j. ng , c. m. bender , and m. bordag for useful conversations and correspondence .",
    "the truly disturbing aspect of our results here and in @xcite are the pole in even dimensions . in particular many very interesting condensed matter systems",
    "are well - approximated by being two dimensional .",
    "are we to conclude that the casimir effect does not exist in two dimensions ?    one trivial way to extract a finite answer from our expressions , which have simple poles at @xmath2",
    "( i will set aside the logarithmic singularity there in the tm mode , because that only occurs in one integral , @xmath157 ) , is to average over the singularity .",
    "if we do so for the scalar result in @xcite , we obtain @xmath158 while for the tm result here , we find @xmath159 which numbers , incidentally , are remarkably close to the leading @xmath157 term , as stated . similarly @xmath160 . ] in @xcite , which are @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "but , there seems to be no reason to have any belief in these numbers .",
    "however , something remarkable does happen in the scalar case .",
    "if we use the first procedure , ( [ zetareg ] ) , we note that the poles can arise both from the integrals and from the explicit zeta functions .",
    "for the latter , let the dependence on @xmath0 be given by @xmath163 which has a pole at @xmath2 .",
    "when we average over the pole , we obtain @xmath164 where the prime denotes differentiation . for the scalar modes it is easy to verify that @xmath165 thus , there is no contribution from those subtracted terms . in other words , they might just as well be omitted , which is what we would do if we inserted a cutoff and simply dropped the divergent terms .",
    "( this procedure does give the correct @xmath10 results . )",
    "this provides some evidence for the validity of the procedure which yields ( [ scave ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the same effect does not occur for the tm modes , @xmath166 . nor",
    "does it occur for higher dimensions , @xmath167 , 6 ,  , even for scalars . and , even for scalars , it is not clear how the divergences of a massive ( 2 + 1 ) theory can be removed .",
