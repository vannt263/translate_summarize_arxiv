    "the galaxy luminosity function ( hereafter lf ) provides a fundamental description of the gross properties of galaxy populations .",
    "the first task of theories of galaxy formation and evolution is to match the observed lf , a task that has been somewhat difficult as uncertain baryonic effects ( e.g. , star formation ) and feedback are needed to transform the mass function of dark matter halos into observables ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "clusters of galaxies , as the largest virialised systems in the universe , have played an important role in this field .",
    "the lf of cluster galaxies can be determined , even at high redshifts , via simple photometry , as the overdensity with respect to the surrounding fields allows us to correct for contamination ( from non members in the foreground and background ) by statistical means , without expensive redshift surveys . however , the faint end of the lf is still in dispute , even at low redshifts , as the steeply rising field counts lead to progressively more unfavourable statistics .",
    "studies of nearby clusters have claimed that the lf consists of a schecher function at the bright end and a steeply rising power law at the faint end ( e.g. , @xcite ) but others have found a single schechter function ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ideally , the lf should be measured in a band where luminosity matches stellar mass as closely as possible , in order to better compare with the predictions of theoretical models and avoid the effects of star formation on bluer ( optical ) bands .",
    "the infrared @xmath1 band has been shown to provide a reasonable approximation to the underlying stellar mass function , and even dynamical mass @xcite .",
    "in addition , both evolutionary and @xmath16-corrections are known to be small and to vary slowly with redshift or with galaxy type . for these reasons , the @xmath1-band lf has been used as a probe of the evolution of galaxy populations ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are relatively few local cluster lfs in the @xmath1-band , owing to the comparatively small size of infrared detectors until recently . in our previous work",
    ", we studied the coma cluster using a complete spectroscopic sample for its inner @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined a lf for the norma cluster and @xcite derived a composite lf for galaxies in the shapley supercluster .",
    "previously , @xcite presented a composite lf for 10 clusters from the 2df sample of @xcite . here",
    "we determine the lf for 24 of these clusters , with new infrared imaging and high redshift completeness .",
    "the following sections describe the data and analysis , present the results and discuss these in the context of previous work and models for galaxy formation and evolution . here",
    ", we assume the standard cosmological parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 .",
    "we have carried out deep @xmath1-band imaging for a set of 24 clusters from the sample of @xcite in order to derive composite @xmath1 band lfs .",
    "our data consist of 300s images in the @xmath0 filter obtained at the ctio 4 m telescope , with either the infrared sideport imager ( ispi  @xcite ) or the noao extremely wide field infrared mosaic ( newfirm  @xcite ) for 20 clusters , covering the clusters out to their abell radius ( 1.5 @xmath22 mpc ) . for a few clusters ( 4/24 )",
    "we have instead used available ukidss data from the large area survey ( data release 10 ) as we could not observe them from ctio in the available time .",
    "table  [ data ] summarizes the data used and basic properties of the clusters .",
    "we have elected not to use 2mass @xcite photometry , except for purposes of calibration , as this is known to miss a considerable fraction of the flux for bright galaxies and to be incomplete for fainter ones @xcite .",
    "we confirm this by comparison with our photometry : on average , 2mass magnitudes ( we use the homogeneous @xmath23 aperture for reference , which should be large enough to include all the flux ) are systematically @xmath24 mag . fainter than ours .",
    "further , some galaxies are already missing from 2mass ( or misclassified as stars ) at @xmath25 .",
    "however , our much deeper data ( 300s on a 4 m class telescope , compared to the 52s exposures on a 1.3 m telescope for 2mass ) should not suffer from these issues .    for ispi and newfirm imaging",
    "we observed using a five point dithering pattern .",
    "for newfirm , the dithering steps were large enough to remove the @xmath26 gaps between the four detectors .",
    "where the abell radius was larger than the size of the detector , we mosaicked to cover the entire field ( this took several ispi fields , as the field of view is only @xmath27 , but only small newfirm mosaics ) .",
    "ispi data were reduced following the conventional pattern for infrared data : removal of flatfield with on and off dome light flats , median sky removal from neighbouring ( in time ) images and astrometric / distortion correction ( from 2mass stars in the field of view ) , followed by a median sum of the images .",
    "newfirm uses a dedicated pipeline on specialised hardware ; this is described in @xcite and essentially carries out the infrared data reduction procedures in an automated fashion .",
    "the pipeline products are then placed in the noao archive for retrieval .",
    "photometric calibration was carried out from 2mass stars in each field .    for clusters within the ukidss sample",
    ", we used their photometry ( petrosian magnitudes ) and star - galaxy classification . for ispi and newfirm data we carried out photometry with sextractor @xcite using a series of parameters that were found to be appropriate for galaxies in our previous work , using kron - style magnitudes as returned by the software ( mag@xmath28auto ) .",
    "we inspected visually all detections to remove contaminants ( stellar spikes , trails , bad pixels on the detector edges , etc . ) and confirm that the catalog does not miss obvious sources or fragments bright ones .",
    "star - galaxy separation was based on the sextractor stellarity index , but we also confirmed the nature of all sources with reference to sdss @xcite or ukst / poss ( photographic ) imaging .",
    "however , we may miss compact dwarfs resembling m32 , that have now been identified in significant numbers in the clash sample @xcite , but may be misclassified as stars by lower resolution imaging ; these may affect the slope of the luminosity function .",
    "ukidss data are in good agreement with our photometry at @xmath29  the mean difference is a few hundreds of a magnitude , which may be due to slight differences in the filter bandpasses .",
    "however , for galaxies at @xmath30 in ukidss there is some evidence of missing flux ( at the level of @xmath31 mag . )",
    "compared to our photometry , likely from the low surface brightness envelopes of brighter galaxies : even if ukidss is carried out on a 4 m telescope in good conditions , the exposure times are necessarily shallower than our deep pointed observations .",
    "finally , we also obtained @xmath32 colours ( using the model magnitudes ) for galaxies within the sdss footprint and @xmath33 colours ( as provided by the wfau ssa service ) for those with ukst data .",
    "see table  [ data ] for details of each source .",
    "redshifts for all our galaxies were then retrieved from the ned database , with a @xmath34 matching radius .",
    "the majority of redshifts come from the sdss and the 2df @xcite surveys , but there are significant contributions from several other sources as well .",
    "members were identified using the ` double gapping ' method originally proposed by @xcite and applied to our sample in @xcite : galaxies were sorted in velocity space and the initial sample of cluster members isolated from the field , requiring that the next nearest galaxy be at @xmath35 km @xmath36 ( i.e. , a first gap in the velocity distribution ) .",
    "we then computed a velocity dispersion and excluded galaxies separated by more than @xmath37 ( second gap ) to isolate a kinematically cleaned sample of cluster members . from these",
    "we then compute the mean radial velocity and velocity dispersion shown in table  [ data ] : the values we report are in good agreement with those presented in @xcite .",

    "the individual lfs for each cluster are relatively poorly determined , because of small number statistics ( we have typically 60 members per cluster ) , especially at the bright end , even though our redshift completeness ( see below ) is high .",
    "for this reason we produce a composite lf , following the methods outlined in @xcite and @xcite and summarised below . as this represents the average of several clusters spanning a wide range of properties , it is likely to be a better measure of the lf than those derived for single clusters , but we explore the variation of the lf according to cluster properties and for red and blue galaxies as well , to understand the role of environmental variations .    as in our previous work",
    "we derive a lf at the mean redshift of the sample @xmath53 .",
    "the reason for doing this is that in this way we avoid the uncertainty of carrying out @xmath54 and @xmath16 corrections to @xmath55 , which are somewhat poorly understood in the infrared ( even though they are likely to be small , of the order of a few 1/100 of a mag . ) and which of course would vary from galaxy to galaxy . as the redshift difference between our clusters and @xmath53 is small",

    "@xcite , for an ensemble of clusters within the shapley supercluster , has @xmath96 , closer to our value for 24 clusters here .",
    "there is considerable variation when comparing with the @xmath7 values for single clusters , as the small number statistics at the bright end makes fitting @xmath7 difficult .",
    "however , our composite lf should provide a better estimate of the lf parameters , as the sparse bright end is more populated .",
    "it is not unfortunately not very informative to carry out a comparison between the individual cluster lfs , even with our high completeness , as the errors are so large that there is no statistical power in the analysis .",
    "the faint end slope slope we derive is in good to reasonable agreement with previous studies , especially the estimates by @xcite for norma and the shapley supercluster in @xcite . in coma ,",
    "the slope is affected by the presence of an inflection in the lf at intermediate magnitudes , but we may remark that there is good agreement with the slope of the lf of red sequence galaxies ( table  [ par1 ] ) - nearly all spectroscopically confirmed coma galaxies in @xcite are red sequence members .",
    "the slope we derive is also steeper than in our previous analysis for a subset of these clusters @xcite , although the quality of the data has improved , especially at the faint end , which might provide at least part of the explanation for the discrepancy .",
    "the most recent field @xmath1-band lf by @xcite has @xmath97 ( for our cosmology and at @xmath53 ) and @xmath98 , although the fit to a schechter function is not good .",
    "@xcite has @xmath99 and @xmath100 , while @xcite has @xmath101 and @xmath102 . despite the differences between these studies",
    ", it appears that the cluster @xmath1 band lf is slightly brighter ( by about 30% ) and somewhat steeper than in the general field .",
    "the brighter lf for cluster galaxies when compared to the field was also found in @xcite , among others , and is understandable if the brighter cluster members are formed from mergers within the cluster environment and/or if the richer cluster environment favours the formation of more massive systems . in order to understand which mechanism is dominant , or even if several such processes are operating",
    ", one would need to compare field and cluster lfs as a function of redshift .",
    "one caveat to this conclusion is that most previous work has been based on 2mass photometry .",
    "as we have seen above , and as previously found by @xcite and @xcite , 2mass magnitudes seem to be @xmath24 magnitudes fainter , likely because of light losses in the low surface brightness envelopes of galaxies . with this ,",
    "the difference between field and cluster @xmath7 is much reduced and they appear to be identical within the errors .",
    "more accurate photometry for wide field surveys is needed to resolve this issue .",
    "the existence of steeper lfs in clusters vs. field galaxies were already pointed out by @xcite for the shapley supercluster .",
    "this steeper slope is somewhat surprising .",
    "this may be an environmental effect , although we would expect the field lf to be steeper if the trends we observe in clusters ( see below ) continue .",
    "one possibility is that the 2mass photometry used by @xcite and @xcite systematically misses faint galaxies , especially at lower surface brightness levels , and thus leads to a flatter slope than would otherwise be measured ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "otherwise , one would have to find a mechanism by which dwarfs are preferentially formed or preserved in the theoretically more hostile cluster environments .",
    "we consider the effects of the cluster environment by splitting our sample into several subsamples according to physically significant properties of clusters such as velocity dispersion and the bautz - morgan class .",
    "we do not find strong evidence that @xmath7 varies across these subsamples .",
    "this argues that the environment does not strongly affect the behaviour of bright galaxies , at least within clusters .",
    "the only significant difference we find is for the slope of the lf of @xmath103 km s@xmath21 subsample to be steeper than for the @xmath104 km s@xmath21 subset , at nearly the @xmath105 level ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ bmtypes ] . for clusters having @xmath104 km",
    "s@xmath21 the lf is flatter than the total lf , while for cluster with @xmath103 km s@xmath21 it is significantly steeper .",
    "we also find that the lf for clusters of bm type @xmath9 ii has also a significantly steeper slope than the total lf and is different from the lf for clusters with bm type @xmath106 ii .",
    "the two lfs ( for clusters with @xmath107 km s@xmath21 and for clusters with bm type @xmath108 ) are also very similar to each other . although the two samples do not fully overlap .",
    "clusters with bm type @xmath106 ii have slightly larger velocity dispersions than clusters with bm type @xmath109 ii .",
    "this may suggest that relatively low mass systems , possibly with a single dominant galaxy , are more favourable to the formation or survival of dwarf galaxies ( as in the low density environments of @xcite ) .",
    "one possibility is that as clusters grow ( from accretion of single galaxies and groups , or mergers with other clusters ) the relative dominance of brightest cluster galaxies decreases as more luminous systems are included within the cluster , and as this process takes place dwarfs may be destroyed or captured by more massive galaxies . here , a single or two massive dominant galaxies in the cluster may be a sign of dynamical youth , rather than evolution .",
    "as clusters grow , mergers may become rarer ( as the velocity dispersion increases ) and the brighter end of the lf may be ` filled in ' by the infall of bright galaxies .",
    "we have also derived the lf for red sequence galaxies , both for all clusters and for the subsamples we have defined above .",
    "the red sequence lf is flatter than the total lf .",
    "the red sequence lf does not appear to vary significantly between any of the cluster subsamples .",
    "this suggests that any environmental variation is due to the different contributions to the faint end of the lf from blue galaxies .",
    "these dominate the low mass end of the lf .",
    "we are not able to explore the environmental dependence of the blue lf as the statistics are too poor ( the normalisation of the blue lf is about one order of magnitude lower than the red lf ) .",
    "however , the lf slope is similar to that of clusters with @xmath103 km s@xmath21 and bm type @xmath9 ii .",
    "this would suggest that these star - forming dwarf galaxies are preferentially preserved in low mass environments or are destroyed in higher density systems , with many large giants , rather than a single dominant system  it is possible that most of the growth of brightest cluster galaxies may take place outside of clusters - an intriguing parallel may be offered by the ` infalling ' cd galaxy in the coma ngc4839 subgroup or the j0454 - 0309 fossil subgroup @xcite .",
    "the actual evolution of the blue galaxies is interesting to consider .",
    "because the red sequence lf is much flatter , they can not be easily added on to the red sequence ( e.g. , by quenching ) .",
    "they might fade considerably , and contribute to the steeper faint end observed by ( e.g. ) @xcite , but one does not expect much fading in @xmath1 , unless they also lose considerable mass ( e.g. , to tidal stripping )",
    ". it would be interesting to increase the sample of clusters and obtain deeper spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite found evidence for an environmental dependence on the near - infrared lf in the shapley supercluster , with the slope of the lf increasing towards lower density regions and being steeper than in the field .",
    "we did not find strong evidence that the lf varies radially in our earlier work @xcite but the statistics at large ( @xmath110 kpc ) radii were quite small .",
    "@xcite suggests that the lf of the coma cluster steepens along the north - south axis corresponding roughly to the infall direction , while @xcite claim that the lf in abell 496 steepens towards its outer regions . in abell",
    "119 @xcite observe a steepening of the lf towards the outer low density regions , together with a more pronounced dip at intermediate luminosities .",
    "the trend of the lf to become steeper in bluer bands is well known from several studies ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "this would suggest that most of the `` environmental '' variation originates from the quenching of low mass galaxies in relatively low density regions , whereas the red sequence members have been largely preprocessed before the epoch of observation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this would explain the observation that the red sequence does not very between our cluster subsamples .",
    "red sequence galaxies are already processed into cluster members in lower density environments .",
    "we can finally compare our findings with the models in @xcite .",
    "for increasing halo mass we see that the @xmath111 stellar mass increases by about 30% over two orders of magnitude in halo mass ; this is broadly consistent with the field vs. cluster comparison above , but not with the nearly constant @xmath7 in all clusters we consider .",
    "however , the local field values may be affected by problems with 2mass photometry .",
    "similarly , the slope is very well matched by the models , but the change in slope with environment is not .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite the models may still suffer from several shortcomings , especially in the inclusion of cluster - specific environmental effects , the efficiency of galaxy formation and the evolution of central and satellite galaxies .",
