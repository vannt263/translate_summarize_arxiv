    "laser control targeting selective , efficient and robust transfers between the states of a quantum system remains very promising in atomic and molecular physics opening large variety of applications extending from photochemistry to quantum information technologies @xcite .",
    "when a molecular species is subjected to strong laser fields , not only its structure could be much altered , but also its dynamical evolution could give rise to spectacular effects within the frame of above threshold dissociation ( atd ) or ionization ( ati ) and their interplay , up to coulomb explosion of protons @xcite .",
    "most of the basic mechanisms underlying such effects have been studied , both theoretically and experimentally , on h@xmath0 and its isotopic parent d@xmath0 , the simplest and lightest systems , with two energetically well - isolated electronic states , still presenting enough generic characteristics and potentiality to be transposed to larger molecules .",
    "control strategies tracking dynamical changes are used taking advantage from antagonistic basic mechanisms , like barrier lowering as opposite to dynamical dissociation quenching ( ddq ) for selective trapping of a given decaying process , or slowing down of a given reactivity channel @xcite .",
    "other optimal control schemes are based on the deep structural changes undergone by the molecular system due to the strength of the laser field . among them",
    "are the well - known bond softening ( bs ) versus vibrational trapping ( vt ) mechanisms @xcite , which are often referred to for channel - selective molecular reactivity or alignment and orientation control @xcite .",
    "specific resonances support the interpretation of such basic mechanisms .",
    "they roughly pertain to two distinct classes with well differentiated characteristics : shape - type when a single field - dressed adiabatic potential barrier is concerned , as in the bs process ; or feshbach - type involving a quasi - bound state accommodated by a bound field - dressed adiabatic potential embedded in , and coupled to some dissociation continua , as in the vt process .",
    "tunneling is operating for shape - type resonances , resulting in important increase of the decay rates ( imaginary part of eigenenergies ) for strong fields .",
    "their short lifetimes render these resonances less interesting for long time control strategies . on the contrary ,",
    "non - adiabatic ( kinetic ) couplings characterize feshbach - type resonances .",
    "such couplings are decaying with increasing field intensity @xcite , giving rise to more robust , long - lived resonances , well adapted to long time control .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that the interplay between these two types of resonances can efficiently be used not only for coherent control purposes , but also for detailed analyses and interpretations of the outcome of sub - femtosecond to attosecond time - resolved pump - probe interferometric spectroscopy , as has recently been performed for a dissociative ionization study of h@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the exotic resonances we refer to in this work lead to even more unexpected , but still achievable , efficient dissociation quenching or selective transfer processes .",
    "once again h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 turn out to be good candidates providing realistic and generic models .",
    "these exotic states can be reached for some specific laser parameters ( namely , wavelength @xmath2 and intensity @xmath3 ) . in the following we consider two such exotic states known as zero - width resonances ( zwr ) and exceptional points ( ep ) .",
    "zwrs are related to destructive interference taking place among fluxes contributing to the outgoing scattering amplitude originating from a vibrational state decaying through two field - dressed molecular adiabatic channels , characterizing a feshbach - type resonance .",
    "the coherent phase peculiarity leading to the destructive interference pattern , can only be achieved for certain couples of laser parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , leading to ( in principle ) infinitely long - lived resonances for both continuous wave @xcite and pulsed lasers @xcite .",
    "the consequence is vanishing photodissociation rates in strong as well as weak field regimes , different at that respect from vt .",
    "as for eps , they concern some specific behavior of a pair of shape and feshbach - type resonances which are coalescing .",
    "the point in the parameter plane ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) corresponding to this coalescence is called an ep @xcite .",
    "more precisely , an ep is a branch point between two resonances with a full degeneracy of their complex eigenvalues ( both energy and decay rate ) described by a unique wavefunction showing self - orthogonality @xcite .",
    "the consequence , in terms of bifurcation properties is that , if laser parameters are varied continuously to encircle such a branch point , it becomes possible to transfer one resonance on the other @xcite .    in molecular physics examples",
    "are found for both zwrs and eps .",
    "the observation of narrow rotational lines in ibr predissociation , despite strong interchannel couplings , has been interpreted in terms of zwrs @xcite .",
    "the collision between an electron and h@xmath1 molecule provides an example for ep @xcite .",
    "other recent examples are the use of eps for control objectives in hydrogen atomic spectra @xcite or in dressed helium atoms @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to produce zwrs and eps at will and in a controllable way in the spectrum of a laser - driven diatomic molecule , by continuously tuning laser parameters .",
    "our control objective is either filtration among vibrational states when addressing zwrs , or population transfer from a given vibrational state @xmath4 to @xmath5 using an ep(@xmath6 ) .",
    "more precisely , starting in field - free conditions , from a vibrational state @xmath4 of h@xmath0 in its ground electronic state , the laser pulse has to be shaped in such a way to transpose @xmath4 on its parent resonance of the floquet hamiltonian description .",
    "zwr strategy consists in building this resonance as a zero - width one and to track it adiabatically all along the pulse . at the end of the pulse , this particular vibrational state @xmath4 is protected against dissociation , whereas all other @xmath7 are decaying .",
    "this is precisely the filtration scheme which can be used for various purposes , as isotope separation in h@xmath0/d@xmath0 mixtures @xcite , or vibrational cooling @xcite .",
    "ep strategy consists in tracking the resonance originating , in field - free conditions , from @xmath4 , and to transport it , while encircling ep(@xmath6 ) , on the one , which at the end of the pulse , merges in the field - free vibrational state @xmath5 .",
    "such population transfers can be used for getting specific vibrational populations ( population inversions aiming at laser applications , for instance ) , or vibrational cooling ( transferring the whole vibrational population on the ground @xmath8 level ) .",
    "finally , as our control schemes are based on finite lifetime resonances , the most important challenge remains robustness , that is the vibrational population left non - dissociated at the end of the pulse .",
    "this precisely addresses the still open question of adiabaticity in such open quantum systems involving a dissipative continuum .",
    "the originality we are claiming is to shape a control field which drives the resonances avoiding their mixing ( single resonance tracking ) and takes as much as possible advantage of the less dissipative process . after a brief review on zwr and ep within the frame of multiphoton floquet hamiltonian model",
    "as applied to h@xmath0 ( section [ sec2 ] ) , we proceed to a complete derivation of the adiabatic control theory both for zwr and ep ( section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "zwr filtration and ep population transfer strategies are illustrated on some specific vibrational levels of h@xmath0 ( section [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we examine the role played by two classes of ( exotic ) resonances and the control strategies associated with the basic mechanisms they are inducing in the strong field photodissociation dynamics of h@xmath0 .",
    "more precisely we are addressing branch point properties of exceptional points ( ep ) @xcite , or to trapping properties of zero - width resonances ( zwr ) @xcite . both",

    "more precisely , we keep relying on the floquet formalism to handle the fast optical oscillations but we assume that the field envelope and frequency vary slowly enough to be efficiently described by an adiabatic formalism . the selected control schemes are based on this assumption that the molecule , starting in a given vibrational state @xmath4 of the field - free molecule , is adiabatically driven by the laser pulse",

    "the last section of the loop consists in following zwr(13 ) path up to field - free @xmath229 state . in the same spirit",
    ", the second scenario is based on a clock - wise contour , still avoiding any shape - type resonances during the wavelength vertical jump section .",
    "a similar analysis shows that this is possible with an initial state @xmath229 and an expected robust transfer to @xmath192 @xcite .",
    "time dependent wavepacket calculations based on these schemes are illustrated in bottom panels of figure [ mixed ] .",
    "both turn out to be efficient in producing fairly selective and robust vibrational population transfers .",
    "the first one aiming at @xmath192 to @xmath229 transfer , leads to excellent selectivity ( remaining @xmath192 population less than 3@xmath288 ) and a robustness of about 42@xmath288 ( undissociated population ) .",
    "the second one , aiming at @xmath229 to @xmath192 transfer , although more robust ( 58@xmath288 undissociated population ) is slightly less selective ( 16@xmath288 population still remaining on @xmath229 ) . finally , going beyond the strict analysis of an adiabatic transfer , the strategy mixing ep with zwrs when shaping laser pulses followed either clock - wise or anti - clock - wise , shows a promising possibility of efficient transfers both from @xmath4 to @xmath5 and the reverse .",
    "we have studied two laser control strategies aiming at vibrational population transfers in h@xmath0 , based on mechanisms involving either very long - lived resonances ( zwr ) , or branch cuts between two coalescing resonances ( ep ) . such studies are advantageously performed for light diatomic species , well adapted for one - dimensional models involving frozen rotation assumption valid for ultra short , femtosecond time scale pulses .",
    "h@xmath0 is an ideal case both for its two - channel photodissociation description ( due to well isolated excited electronic states with respect to the pulse bandwidth ) and for the well isolated zwr paths and eps ( due to rather large vibrational levels separation ) .",
    "zwrs and eps are localized in the laser ( wavelength , intensity)-parameter plane as field - induced structural signatures of the molecular system in a pure adiabatic description , referring to the floquet hamiltonian model with periodic continuous - wave lasers .",
    "control strategies are based on tracking the resulting resonances either by remaining on some zwr paths for vibrational filtration purpose , or turning around an ep to continuously switch from one resonance to another , for vibrational population transfer purpose .",
    "as we are dealing with a dissociation mechanism , a crucial issue turns out the shaping of a laser pulse not only targeting tracking , but optimized for robustness within the challenging frame of adiabatic transport in multiphoton processes with nuclear continua .",
    "zwrs seen as bound states in continuum are ideal candidates for adiabaticity , which unfortunately is not the case of eps , precisely because they involve coalescence of full degenerate resonances .",
    "the adiabatic theory we have worked out shows that in some situations , such transports may be valid on strictly mathematical grounds .",
    "moreover , referring to time - dependent evolution of the full vibrational dynamics , we show that the limits of applicability can even be extended .",
    "this is achieved by appropriately following laser loops in terms of specific clock or anti - clock - wise contours , avoiding non - adiabatic contamination of feshbach - type resonances by their short - lived unstable shape - type partners .",
    "we also show how such control issues can be improved by mixed strategies , where feshbach - type resonances tracking follows zwr paths , avoiding any population lost , at least up to the nearby ep position . in addition , due to rather modest field intensities in the vis - ir wavelength regime , with relatively limited frequency chirp amplitudes , such lasers remain within experimental feasibility criteria .",
    "an even more systematic future improvement would be the localization , in the laser parameter plane , of all zwr paths together with nearby eps and their corresponding non - adiabatic couplings .",
    "optimal paths that the laser loop should follow could then be built in such a way to avoid both high dissipative and strong coupling regions .",
