    "the phenomenon of chemical inhomogeneity within galactic globular clusters is still not clearly understood ( see reviews by suntzeff 1993 and kraft 1994 ) .",
    "while there is only @xmath4 centauri and perhaps also m22 which show variations in their iron abundances , many globular clusters have variations in elements like c , n and o ( e.g. hesser 1976 ) . however , other clusters seem to be chemically very homogeneous .",
    "in searching for explanations of abundance variations within globular clusters there are basically two possibilities : primordial variations and inhomogeneities caused by stellar evolution during the giant branch ( gb ) or later phases .",
    "studies of the abundances of cno elements in globular clusters have not led to clear results yet . on the one hand ,",
    "most of the cyanogen ( cn ) variations can be successfully explained by processes during the cno cycle ( kraft 1994 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "cn variations in globular clusters also have been found in main - sequence stars ( suntzeff 1989 , briley et al . 1991 ) , which points to primordial inhomogeneities .",
    "therefore it is very interesting to make a large census of cn band strenghts in both giants and main - sequence stars .    since heavy elements like iron",
    "are not synthesized in present globular - cluster stars , variations of the iron abundance among cluster stars are believed to be of primordial origin . however , in the case of the extraordinarily massive globular cluster @xmath4 centauri two other explanations are under discussion .",
    "first , there might have been secondary star formation within the cluster from enriched gas that was not blown out of the cluster during its formation ( e.g. norris et al . 1996 ) .",
    "second , @xmath4 centauri might be the result of the merging of two clusters with different metallicities ( searle 1977 , icke & alcaino 1988 , norris et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the inhomogeneity in @xmath4 centauri is visible in the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) by way of a significant colour dispersion among the giant - branch stars ( e.g. persson et al . 1980 ) . since a broad colour dispersion is visible on the giant branch of the smaller cluster m22 as well ( as mentioned already by arp & melbourne 1959 )",
    ", this cluster has also been regarded as a candidate for a primordial abundance spread . however , all the iron - rich stars of the sample ( ddo survey ) by hesser et al .",
    "( 1977 ) have been identified as non - members in later studies ( lloyd evans 1978 , peterson & cudworth 1994 ) . moreover , in more recent spectroscopic investigations ( lehnert et al .",
    "1991 , brown & wallerstein 1992 ) measurable variations in iron are not confirmed , whereas variations in cn are clearly detectable ( norris & freeman 1982 , 1983 ; brown et al .",
    "lehnert et al .",
    "( 1991 ) give an upper limit for a possible metallicity spread of @xmath5[fe / h]@xmath6 dex .",
    "the origin of the colour dispersion in m22 might rather be explained by differential foreground reddening . a spectroscopic analysis by crocker ( 1988 ) and polarisation measurements by minniti et al .",
    "( 1990 , 1992 ) constrain the reddening variations to be less than 0.08 mag .",
    "bates et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , investigating the region of m22 with iras data , give a value of @xmath7 0.05 for the cluster field .",
    "several studies have shown that the strmgren @xmath2 index ( @xmath2 is the difference between the colour indices @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) ist not only a good indicator for the mean metallicity of late type stars , but is also sensitive for cn abundances ( e.g. bell & gustafsson 1978 ) .",
    "ccd strmgren photometry offers the possibility to measure metallicities and cyanogen strengths of many giants in globular clusters simultaneously .",
    "it is therefore a appropriate tool for adressing the question of metallicity / cn band distribution with a much larger sample of stars than spectroscopy .",
    "anthony - twarog et al .",
    "( 1995 ) already applied the strmgren system to m22 .",
    "they found that the m@xmath10 index is indeed closely correlated with cn - band strengths and that cn - variations are found all over the giant branch .",
    "the intention of the present paper is to make a differential comparison between m55 and m22 and to investigate the influence of the differential reddening in m22 .",
    "we therefore re - investigated the anomal abundance anomalies of m22 with @xmath11 photometry and combine our results with spectroscopic measurements of norris & freeman ( 1982 , 1983 ; hereafter refered to as nf ) .",
    "moreover , we discuss photometric results for m55 , for which spectroscopic measured cn abundances are also available ( smith & norris 1982 ; briley et al .",
    "m55 is known to be rather monometallic ( zinn & west 1984 ) and it is therefore an excellent comparison object in order to investigate cn abundances of two galactic globular clusters with different chemical properties .",

    "( 1993 ) with known cn abundances ( table 4 ) , identified by the identification numbers from lee ( 1976 ) .",
    "this sample also includes results from the measurements of smith & norris ( 1982 ) .",
    "the range of cyanogen strengths is given by @xmath62 ( briley et al .",
    "1993 ) , where @xmath60 is the spectroscopic index for the cn band beginning at 3883  ( see norris & freeman 1982 for a detailed description ) . in our @xmath38 diagram of m55 ( fig .",
    "2 ) the scatter in @xmath2 is small and therefore no signs for significant cn variations are visible .",
    "the mean strmgren metallicity of the selected 27 stars is @xmath63 dex , derived with the calibration of hilker .",
    "we define @xmath64 to be the vertical distance from the position of an individual star in the @xmath38 diagram to the calibration line of @xmath63 dex . in fig.3 , @xmath64 has been plotted versus the cyanogen index @xmath60 .",
    "no correlation between the @xmath64 values and the cyanogen strengths can be seen .",
    "the variations of the @xmath64 values are of similar size as the photometric errors of the @xmath2 index , so that the @xmath2-cn anticorrelation found by richtler ( 1988 ) might be below our detection limit .",
    "however , our measurements give no indication for a significant abundance spread in cn in the cluster giants of m55 .",
    "the comparison between the photometric study of richtler ( 1988 ) and the present data reveals only slight differences in the measured strmgren colours . from a comparison of 7 stars we find that our values of @xmath31 , @xmath9 and @xmath2 show mean deviations of @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( in the sense of @xmath5colour @xmath68 colour@xmath69colour@xmath70 ) .",
    "it is most likely that these shifts reflect the usage of different standard stars ( see richtler 1988 ) .",
    "anyway , the differences are of no importance for the qualitative comparison described above .",
    "the cmd of m22 is presented in fig .",
    "4 . it contains all stars brighter than @xmath71 and with @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "the stars from the inner part have been omitted because of the high star density in the center of m22 and the resulting large photometric errors .",
    "the shown sample has been cleaned by error selection as done for m55 .",
    "the basic features of the red giant branch ( rgb ) and the blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) are well defined . in striking difference to m55",
    "is the large colour spread among the red giant branch , as already mentioned by arp & melbourne ( 1959 ) .",
    "a similar spread is also visible on the bhb , which suggests that differential reddening is the dominating effect for the origin of the colour dispersion in the cmd .",
    "however , since a contribution to the colour range by a possible metallicity spread in m22 can not be excluded , the cmd alone can not clarify the situation .    in the following , we select red giants by defining the ridges of the red giant branch by two parallel curves which at @xmath75 are separated in colour by @xmath76 mag .",
    "fig.5 shows the @xmath38 diagram of m22 .",
    "selected are stars from the red giant branch with @xmath77 and @xmath40 . in sharp contrast to m55 , the distribution of stars does not exhibit a well defined straight line but shows a strongly scattered distribution , so that an accurate determination of a mean cluster metallicity with the method described in sect.3.2 is not possible without knowing the reasons for the colour spread .",
    "previous measurements indicate that the foreground reddening in the direction to m22 is @xmath78 mag ( e.g. alcaino & liller 1983 , crocker 1988 ) .",
    "in addition , recent spectroscopic studies in m22 lead to a mean cluster metallicity of @xmath79 dex ( carretta & gratton 1997 ) . the @xmath38 diagram shown in fig.5 is reddening corrected with @xmath80 , equivalent to the value given by alcaino & liller ( 1983 ) . using hilker s calibration , some of the giant branch stars with @xmath53 lie in a range higher than @xmath81 dex , so that , with respect to the expected mean metallicity , the giants seem to be scattered to higher metallicities .",

    "the lower panel shows the distribution projected on the sphere .",
    "the redder stars clearly tend to be on the southern side , especially along a narrow region from the center towards the south of the cluster .",
    "in contrast , many of the bluer giants are located on the north - eastern side .",
    "subdividing the cluster into quarters we find an excess of red stars in the south - eastern quarter with a significance of 2@xmath83 .",

    "with regard to the cumulative distribution of red and blue stars in the azimuthal angle we obtain a probability of @xmath84 percent that the red and the blue giants are taken from a different distribution function ( kolmogorov - smirnov test ) .",
    "this inhomogeneous distribution of the red and blue cluster giants indicates variations in the reddening , obviously caused by patchily structured dust in the foreground of m22 . from the width of the giant branch ( fig .  6 , upper panel ) we estimate a total range of @xmath85 mag for the reddening variations , after taking a photometric error in @xmath9 of @xmath32 mag into account",
    ".    fig .",
    "7 provides an assessment of the appearance of `` red '' and `` blue '' red giants in the @xmath38 diagram , but no correlation between the scatter in this diagram and the colour spread in the cmd is visible .",
    "we would expect that `` red '' rgb stars show systematically lower metallicities , if reddening would be dominantly responsible for a stellar locus in the @xmath2,@xmath9 diagram .",
    "variable cn - abundances remain as a plausible explanation for the scatter .",
    "the strong cn - band at 4216   can reduce the flux in the @xmath17 filter significantly and thus may lead to a higher @xmath2 value , while the overall metallicity remains the same ( bell & gustafsson 1978 ) .",
    "the distribution in the @xmath38 diagram therefore may be an indication that the m22 giants exhibit strongly variing cn - bands .",
    "a large range of cn abundances in m22 has indeed been spectroscopically observed by nf .",
    "60 giant stars from the sample of nf with known cn abundances have been identified and compared with our data .",
    "table 5 shows these stars with the identification numbers from arp & melbourne ( 1959 ) , magnitudes and colours from our photometry , and the cn band abundances from nf , given by the index @xmath60 .",
    "values for the @xmath60 index vary between @xmath86 ( cn weak ) and @xmath87 ( cn strong ) and the cn variations therefore are significantly higher than observed in m55 . to investigate the influence of the cn strengths on the @xmath2 index in the case of m22 , all cn strong stars with @xmath60 values larger than @xmath88",
    "have been plotted in the @xmath38 diagram ( fig .",
    "8 , upper panel ) as filled circles , while the cn weak stars ( @xmath89 ) are shown as open circles .",
    "the correlation between the positions of the giants in the @xmath38 diagram and their cn abundances is clearly visible .",
    "all stars with strong cn abundances are located in the upper part of the diagram and it is reasonable to conclude that also all the other stars in this area , that have no spectroscopic measurements , are cn rich as well .",
    "the influence of the cyanogen strengths on the @xmath2 index can be seen in more detail by using the metallicity calibration for the @xmath38 diagram .",
    "the mean strmgren metallicity ( using the calibration of hilker ) of all 60 giant stars with known cn abundances is @xmath90 dex , taking a reddening value of @xmath80 into account ( the cn strengths definitely influence this value ; it is therefore too high ) . in fig.8 ( lower panel ) , @xmath64 ( as defined in sect .",
    "3.3 ) to the calibration line of @xmath90 dex is plotted versus @xmath60 .",
    "in contrast to m55 , the influence of the cyanogen strenghts on the @xmath2 index in m22 is significant .",
    "@xmath64 becomes larger by increasing cn abundances and the cn variations therefore shift the giant stars to higher @xmath2 values .",
    "this effect dominates the shape of the @xmath38 diagram , it is even stronger than the reddening variations of about @xmath85 mag .",
    "our results are similar to investigations of anthony - twarog et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who investigated cn and ca abundances in relation with the strmgren @xmath2 index for m22 .",
    "we compared 15 stars from their observations with our data stars and find a good agreement in the measured strmgren colours .",
    "mean deviations are @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( see also sect.3.3 ) .",
    "the fact that only strong cyanogen abundances influence the @xmath2 index offers us the possibility to determine the mean strmgren metallicity and the mean reddening for m22 using only the 40 spectroscopically measured cn weak giants . with the method described in sect.3.2",
    "we derive a cluster metallicity of @xmath94 dex and a reddening of @xmath95 . as for m55 ,",
    "the derived metallicity of m22 is ( with regard to the expected errors ) in agreement with recent spectroscopic results , such as from carretta & gratton ( 1997 , @xmath96 dex ) and lehnert et al .",
    "( 1991 , @xmath97 dex ) .",
    "a comparative study of the two galactic globular clusters m55 and m22 has shown that the strmgren system can efficiently detect differences in the cn - strength distribution of globular clusters . moreover , with the method presented in sect.3.2 strmgren photometry can be used for the simultaneous determination of mean metallicities _ and _ reddening values in globular clusters .",
    "the present study of m55 and m22 has revealed that the clusters are very different regarding the distribution of strmgren colours .",
    "m55 turns out to be very uniform with respect to strmgren - metallicities .",
    "the sharp red giant branch in the cmd as well as in the @xmath38 diagram indicates the chemical homogeneity of this globular cluster .    for m22",
    ", we confirm the results by anthony - twarog et al .",
    "a large scatter in the strmgren @xmath2,@xmath9 diagram indicates a large spread in cn strengths among red giants .",
    "therefore , strmgren colours of m22 stars can not be interpreted in terms of an overall metallicity , in particular nothing can be said concerning an intrinsic metallicity variation among m22 stars .",
    "moreover , the colour spread of the rgb and the bhb in the colour - magnitude diagram of m22 is not caused by a metallicity variation but probably by patchy reddening variations in the order of @xmath3 over the cluster area , because most of the reddest giant - branch stars are spatially concentrated in the southern part of the cluster .",
    "this , and the fact that there is no correlation between the dispersions in the cmd and the @xmath38 diagram , led us to conclude that a spread in [ fe / h ] , if present , is of minor importance with respect to the cn scatter . considering similar results for m22 of anthony - twarog et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and the spectroscopic measurements by lehnert et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , @xmath4 cen remains as the only globular cluster in the milky way , where significant evidence exists for a possibly primordial dispersion in [ fe / h ] .",
    "so far , the existence of a wide range of cyanogen strengths has been shown only in a few globular clusters ( see kraft 1994 for a detailed overview ) and their origin can be explained by primordial as well as by evolutionary origin .",
    "see to this also the extensive discussion in anthony - twarog et al .",
    "perhaps , cn - rich clusters may be brought into relation with anomalies found in the comparison of integrated spectra of m31 clusters with those of galactic globular clusters .",
    "several authors found ( burstein et al .",
    "1988 ; brodie & huchra 1990 ) that , at the same metallicity , m31 clusters showed stronger cn - features than galactic clusters .",
    "unfortunately , no work exists measuring integral cn strengths for both m22 and m55 .",
    "it is of obvious interest to perform a larger census of the cn - strength distribution among globular - cluster stars .",
    "the strmgren system proved to be an efficient tool for this purpose . at present , it is not possible to investigate the relation of `` cn - richness '' with any other properties of globular clusters .",
    "m55 and m22 are perhaps representatives of two classes of globular clusters regarding their cn - strength distribution . if the cn - strengths in m22 are decoupled from stellar evolution , what else can be the cause ?",
    "a striking difference between m55 and m22 is their stellar density .",
    "m55 is one of the most loosely structured globular clusters while , in contrast , m22 has a quite high density .",
    "it is imaginable that encounters or merging of stars can change the cn - surface abundance of red giants .",
    "it is therefore of high interest to study a larger sample of globular clusters .",
    "we would like to thank k.s .",
    "de boer and t. puzia for helpful comments on this work .",
    "as mentioned in sect . 3.1 , a population of blue straggler stars ( bss ) is visible in the cmd of m55 in the area above the turn - off point . the existence of bss in m55 and their central concentration has already been shown in detailed analyses by mandushev et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and zaggia et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    at present",
    "there is much evidence that bss are close or merged binary stars ( e.g. see mandushev 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "this theory is supported by the finding that the bss are often more centrally concentrated than other stellar types within globular clusters , which might be indicative for a dynamical mass segregation . in the cmd",
    "the bss sequence ranges up to 2.5 magnitudes above the top ( see fig.a1 ) . from our data sample of m55 we selected 56 bss candidates from the inner @xmath98 for further investigations , shown in fig.a1 as filled circles .",
    "we compared the spatial distribution of the 56 bss with that of 1377 sub - giant branch ( sgb ) stars chosen from the same magnitude interval to ensure that incompleteness does not influence the comparison . in fig.a1 ,",
    "the cumulative distributions of the sgb stars and the bss are plotted .",
    "the bss are clearly more concentrated than the sgb stars within the selected radius . running a kolmogorov - smirnov test we obtain a 92 percent probability that the bss and the sgb stars are taken from different distributions , a value that is similar to the one found by mandushev et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for m55 . these results favour mass segregation and further support that bss have on the average larger masses than subgiants and thus are merged stars or binaries .",
