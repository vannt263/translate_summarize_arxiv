    "we introduce in this work a path integral representation for the ground state of the anisotropic heisenberg xxz model with a pinned - spin as a suitable random walk on two dimensional lattices .",
    "our representation generalises what we had previously introduced for the standard xxz chain .",
    "the reason to introduce spin - pinned models is to deal with localised impurities in magnetic materials @xcite .",
    "the path integral representation is of great help in establishing the properties of the model under investigation : the square norm of the quantum state vector admits the interpretation of the path integral partition function , and the probabilistic features , in particular related to markov type properties , play a decisive role in evaluating correlation functions and other physical quantities .",
    "we prove here two recursion relations that express the properties of systems of a given size in terms of those of smaller size .",
    "recursion relations of this kind have been used successfully to derive bounds on correlation functions in @xcite .",
    "let us consider the two dimensional lattice @xmath1 .",
    "a `` zig - zag '' path @xmath2 is a connected path of unit steps in @xmath1 monotonically increasing in both coordinates . for each @xmath3",
    "the path will be encoded in a sequence of @xmath4 conventionally associating @xmath5 to a horizontal step and @xmath6 to a vertical one .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 the length of the path i.e. the sum of the steps ( see figure 1 ) .    a path integral model on @xmath8 is a law that associates positive weights @xmath9 to a given set of paths .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the set of all paths from an initial point @xmath11 to a final one @xmath12 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the collection of all such paths visits all the points of the _ rectangle _ @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "canonical _ partition function is defined as [ gn ] z(i , f ) = _ p _ i , f w(p ) , which induce the probability measure on @xmath10 given by [ pr ] prob(p ) = . in path",
    "integral models , correlation functions measure the probability that a path goes through particular points @xmath16 , with n_o i_1 i_2 ... n_f , and m_o j_1 y_2 ... m_f .",
    "the one - point correlation function is defined as the probability of crossing a single point @xmath17 [ prob1 ] p_i , f(q)= , where z(i , f q ) = _ p_i , f(q ) w(p ) [ condpar ] and @xmath18 is the set of paths from the @xmath19 to @xmath20 that pass through the point @xmath17 .",

    "* we apply the property ( [ tf ] ) to translate the partition functions in ( [ pf ] ) : [ trans ] z_q(n-1,l+1-n)=q^-2(k+1)(n-1 ) z_q(n - n+1,m - l-1+n;n , m ) , in the same way we obtain [ trans1 ] z_q(n,l - n)=q^-2(k+1)n z_q(n - n,m - l+n;n , m ) for the second term in ( [ pf ] ) . substituting ( [ trans ] ) and ( [ trans1 ] ) into ( [ pf ] )",
    "we get @xmath84 by using the theorem [ tf ] , we rewrite the terms between braces as follows [ pf1 ] z(n , m)=_n+n=n q^-2(k+1)n z_q(n , k - n ) z_q(n , k - n;n , m ) .",
    "the above expression can be interpreted as the average value of @xmath85 over all the paths from the origin to @xmath86 that pass through the point @xmath87 . here",
    ", @xmath56 is the number of down spins , i.e. , horizontal steps in the path , to the left of the pinning site .",
    "as the quantity to be averaged only depends @xmath56 , not on the individual path , we just need to know the distribution of @xmath56 , which is given by the probabilities @xmath88 , defined by p_n , m(n)= = .",
