    "heavy atom / ion impurities , such as tungsten in a fusion plasma , may cause critical radiation losses and even minuscule concentrations prevent ignition . for modeling the behaviour of tungsten in a plasma , a comprehensive knowledge of atomic collision processes involving tungsten atoms and ions in all charge states is required . due to the complexity of the tungsten atomic structure",
    ", theoretical calculations of atomic cross sections are challenging and guidance by experiments is vital .",
    "photoionization measurements together with detailed theoretical calculations are a particularly sensitive spectroscopic tool for investigating the role of intermediate multiply excited states in photon - ion interactions with implications also for electron - ion recombination and ionization processes .",
    "the present work on tungsten ions , w@xmath7 , where @xmath8 = 2 and 3 , provides benchmarks for future electron - impact excitation work .    cross sections and rate coefficients for electron - ion collision processes of tungsten ions have been investigated experimentally  @xcite , however , there are no such experimental data on electron - impact excitation of tungsten atoms or ions in any charge state .",
    "an overview of experimental and theoretical work on electron collisions with tungsten atoms and ions has been provided recently by mller  @xcite .",
    "photoionization of neutral tungsten has been investigated experimentally by costello  @xcite and by sladeczek  @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations on photoionization of neutral tungsten atoms were carried out by boyle  @xcite , sladeczek  @xcite and , more recently , by ballance and mclaughlin  @xcite .",
    "our collaboration has recently presented experimental and theoretical results for photoionization of w@xmath9 ions  @xcite .",
    "preliminary reports on our ongoing tungsten photoionization project have previously been presented at various conferences  @xcite .",
    "the ground level of the w@xmath0 ion is @xmath10 with an ionization potential of ( 26.0 @xmath11 0.4 )  ev  @xcite .",
    "the ground level of the w@xmath1 ion is @xmath12 with an ionization potential of ( 38.2 @xmath11 0.4 )  ev  @xcite . as in our preceding study on w@xmath9 ions",
    "one has to assume that all levels within the ground terms of w@xmath0 and w@xmath1 are populated during the preparation of the parent ion beams used in the experiment .",
    "theoretical calculations were therefore carried out for all fine - structure levels within the ground terms of the two parent ion species investigated .",
    "single ionization of w@xmath0 forming w@xmath1 by interaction of a single photon with a w@xmath0 ion comprises contributions from direct ionization and from excitation of autoionizing resonances .",
    "direct electron ejection processes relevant to the total cross section for single ionization of the w@xmath0 ion in its ground configuration include @xmath13 indirect ionization of w@xmath0 levels within the @xmath14 ground term may proceed via resonance formation @xmath15 and subsequent decay by emission of a single electron @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total orbital momentum quantum number and @xmath18 the total angular momentum quantum number of the intermediate resonant state .",

    "similarly , single - photon single ionization of ground - configuration w@xmath1 forming w@xmath21 comprises contributions from direct ionization @xmath22 and from excitation of autoionizing resonances with subsequent emission of a single electron .",
    "in particular , resonances in the photoionization of w@xmath1 levels within the @xmath23 ground term may occur by excitation to short - lived bound states residing above the ionization threshold @xmath24 that subsequently decay by emission of a single electron @xmath25    in general , for the more highly ionized stages of tungsten , it becomes simpler to obtain accurate target wave - functions to represent the collision processes , due to the coulomb charge of the target and the slight reduction in the @xmath2-matrix box size . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first joint detailed experimental and theoretical study on w@xmath0 and w@xmath1 ions in the photon energy region of near - threshold excitation .",

    "section 3 presents a brief outline of the theoretical work .",
    "section 4 presents a discussion of the results obtained from both the experimental and theoretical methods . finally in section 5 conclusions",
    "are drawn from the present investigation .",
    "the present measurements on photoionization of w@xmath0 and w@xmath1 ions were carried out at the photon - ion merged - beam ( ipb ) setup at beamline 10.0.1.2 of the advanced light source ( als ) at lawrence berkeley national laboratory in berkeley , california , usa . the experimental arrangement and the procedures employed have been described previously by covington  @xcite .",
    "later developments were discussed by mller  @xcite and details of measurements with tungsten ions have recently been presented in the context of the photoionization of w@xmath9 ions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , only an overview of the experiments with w@xmath0 and w@xmath1 ions is provided here .",
    "the ions were produced from w(co)@xmath26 vapour in an electron - cyclotron - resonance ( ecr ) ion source , accelerated to ground potential by a voltage of 6  kv , mass and charge analyzed by a bending magnet , and transported to the photon - ion interaction region . there",
    "the isotopically resolved beam of ions in the desired charge state was superimposed on a beam of synchrotron - radiation from an undulator with a subsequent monochromator providing photons at a narrow bandwidth .",
    "for the present experiment a constant resolution of 100  mev was chosen .",
    "product ions resulting from the interaction of single photons with single isolated ions were separated from the parent ion beam by a second bending magnet and directed to a suitable single - particle detector  @xcite . for the separation of true photoionization signal from background",
    "the photon beam was chopped which allowed for separate recording of signal plus background and background alone .",
    "the merged - beam technique  @xcite involving three - dimensional beam overlap measurements was employed to determine absolute cross sections at few selected photon energies and to obtain fine energy scans ( cross - section spectra ; energy steps of 0.1  ev ) for single ionization of w@xmath0 and w@xmath1 ions . a photon energy range of approximately 20  90  ev was covered .",
    "typical ion currents of @xmath27w@xmath0 ions were 4  7.5  na for energy - scan measurements whereas the beams were more strongly collimated for absolute measurements and then only reached a few hundred pa .",
    "scan spectra were obtained with 3  5  na of @xmath27w@xmath1 ions and absolute cross sections for w@xmath1 were measured with ion currents of up to 200  pa .",
    "the photoionization spectra were measured with the monochromator set to a constant resolution of 100 mev . due to mechanical limitations of the monochromator - slit sizes the maximum possible bandwidth of the photon beam is smaller than 100  mev at energies below 27  ev and reaches about 40  mev at 17  ev photon energy",
    "this change of bandwidth is irrelevant for w@xmath1 because 27  ev is already below the ionization threshold .",
    "the change also does not matter for w@xmath0 because the photoionization spectrum is relatively smooth at energies below 30  ev .",
    "excursions in the energy range 23 - 24  ev indicate narrow resonances which are associated with metastable initial states of the w@xmath0 parent ions . as in our previous work on photoionization of w@xmath9  @xcite the measured cross sections",
    "were corrected for effects of higher - order radiation present in the photon beam .",
    "a detailed description of the assessment of the necessary corrections is provided in reference  @xcite .",
    "the experimental uncertainties were also discussed in detail in reference  @xcite .",
    "identical sources of systematic uncertainties were considered in the present paper and only the statistical uncertainties are specific to the present measurements .",
    "the total uncertainty of measured absolute cross sections amounts to about 25% at the cross section maximum .",
    "the uncertainty of the photon energies is less than @xmath11100  mev in the whole energy range investigated .",
    "it is practically impossible to produce pure ground - level beams of low- to intermediate - charge tungsten ions with intensities sufficient for merged - beam photon - ion or electron - ion collision experiments  @xcite . at best , it may be possible to prepare beams of many - electron tungsten ions in the ground term .",
    "the very long - lived levels within this term are likely populated according to their statistical weights .",
    "for the present theoretical treatment we used a dirac - coulomb @xmath2-matrix approach  @xcite , which includes relativistic effects , to calculate photoionization cross sections for ground and excited levels of w@xmath0 and w@xmath1 ions .",
    "metastable states are populated in the primary ion beam in the tungsten - ion merged - beams experiments and require theoretical calculations to be carried out in addition to the treatment of ground - state photoionization .",
    "recent modifications to the dirac - atomic-@xmath2-matrix - codes ( darc )  @xcite have allowed large scale photoionization cross section calculations to be made on heavy complex systems of prime interest to astrophysics and plasma applications in a timely manner .",
    "these codes are presently running on a variety of parallel high performance computing architectures world wide @xcite .",
    "cross - section calculations for photoionization of various trans - fe elements , including se@xmath9  @xcite , kr@xmath9  @xcite , xe@xmath9  @xcite , and xe@xmath28  @xcite , @xmath29 inner - shell studies on si@xmath9 ions @xcite , valence - shell studies on neutral sulfur @xcite , neutral and singly ionized tungsten @xcite have been made using these darc codes .",
    "suitable agreement of the darc photoionization cross - sections with high resolution measurements made at leading synchrotron light sources such as als and soleil have been obtained .",
    "details of the calculations for w@xmath0 and w@xmath1 ions are outlined below .",
    "photoionization cross sections for w@xmath0 ions were performed for the ground and the excited metastable levels within the lowest @xmath14 term associated with the @xmath30 configuration .",
    "the resulting cross sections were benchmarked with the current measurements .",
    "the first model investigated followed the work of ballance and co - workers on electron impact - excitation and ionization of the w@xmath1 ion @xcite .",
    "the theoretical model included 19 levels arising from the @xmath31 configuration , 16 levels originating from the @xmath32 configuration , 2 levels of the @xmath33 configuration , 45 levels of the @xmath34 configuration and the 67 levels arising from the @xmath35 configuration , for a total of 149 levels .",
    "a second model was investigated where we opened the @xmath36 shell and included the additional 180 levels from the @xmath37 configuration along with opening the @xmath38 shell @xmath39 which adds 63 levels to give a model of 392 levels in the close - coupling calculations .",
    "all the atomic structure calculations were carried out using the grasp code @xcite .",
    "table 1 shows a sample of our energy levels compared with the experimental values available from the nist tabulations with more elaborate 926-level ci calculations from the grasp code .",
    "we found that our six - configurations model of the w@xmath1 residual ion namely , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath37 appears to be an adequate representation for the energies of these levels .",
    "the 926-level model illustrates the slow convergence of the atomic structure to known nist values @xcite .",
    "all of the 392 levels from the 6-configuration model were included in the close - coupling calculations .",
    "the @xmath2-matrix boundary radius of 13.28 bohr radii was sufficient to envelop the radial extent of all the @xmath45=6 atomic orbitals of the residual w@xmath1 ion .",
    "a basis of 16 continuum orbitals was sufficient to span the incident experimental photon energy range from threshold up to 125 ev .",

    "the slow convergence of the theoretical cross - section results with increasing number of target states in our close - coupling expansion for these ions of tungsten together with the limited computational resources make calculations with sufficiently large basis sets and a sufficiently fine mesh unfeasible at the present time .",
    "it is therefore necessary to take a pragmatic approach and use a suitable energy mesh of , for example , 109 @xmath94ev for photoionization of w@xmath1 ions in our darc photoionization cross section calculations to delineate the resonance features in the cross sections over the whole region investigated . with the given grid size we had to restrict the calculations to 379 close - coupling levels to keep the calculations within the available already very efficiently exploited forefront computational resources .",
    "the comparisons with the experimental data ( see figures [ fig2 ] , [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) show that this pragmatic approach is adequate to reproduce the main features and the overall sizes of the measured cross sections .",
    "photoionization cross sections for w@xmath0 and w@xmath1 ions were obtained from large - scale close - coupling calculations within the dirac - coulomb @xmath2-matrix approximation ( darc ) .",
    "the theoretical results are compared with experimental measurements made at the als synchrotron radiation facility in the energy range from the respective thresholds up to 90 ev .    in view of the complexity of the systems under",
    "study the comparison of the experimental results and the dirac - coulomb @xmath2-matrix calculations shows remarkably good agreement .",
    "this agreement appears to become increasingly better with increasing ion charge state .",
    "this is most likely due to the increasing importance of the electron - nucleus relative to the electron - electron interactions when the charge state of the ion increases .",
    "the proper treatment of electron - electron correlations in the complex many - electron tungsten ions requires extremely large - scale calculations which are presently outside of the available computational capabilities .",
    "however , the improving quality of the present darc approximation along the sequence w , w@xmath9 , w@xmath0 , w@xmath1 is encouraging for applying a similar approach to higher charge states of tungsten ions .    from the present investigation and our previous study on the photoionization of w@xmath9 ions @xcite",
    "we see that the close - coupling expansion for tungsten ions is slowly convergent which we attribute to the difficulty to model correlation in complex atomic systems such as low - charge tungsten ions .",
    "we note that including around 400 target states in our theoretical work yields the main features in the experimental cross sections .",
    "we speculate that spectroscopic accuracy can only be achieved by using very much larger basis sets and ci target expansions comprising at least several thousands of target levels . such large scale photoionization cross section calculations are not feasible at present due to the limitations of computer architectures and resources to which access is presently available .",
