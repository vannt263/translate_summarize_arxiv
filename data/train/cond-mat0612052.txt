    "molecular electronics has emerged as one of the promising subfields of nanophysics . individual nano objects such as molecules and carbon nanotubes can be connected to leads of different nature , and the degrees of freedom of molecules could be used in principle to modulate quantum transport between the leads @xcite : it is hoped that these degrees of freedom could allow specific functions of nanoelectronics .",
    "a large body of work has focused on the potential applications of the specific energy spectrum of molecules , as well as their vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite recently , there has been some focus on transport through molecules which have their own spin , for instance because a specific atom of this molecular system possesses a magnetic moment .",
    "this is unlike `` usual '' molecular quantum dots where the molecular spin corresponds to the effective spin of the itinerant electron , giving rise for example to kondo physics .",
    "@xcite there are many experimental proposals for such molecular magnets .",
    "mn@xmath2 acetates or carbon fullerenes with one or more atoms trapped inside are examples . depending on the sample , and on the structure of the molecule",
    ", the spin orientation can have a preferred axis or it can have a more isotropic nature",
    ". there have been recent experiments on similar systems , with applications to spin valves .",
    "@xcite in this paper we focus on the isotropic regime . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the current through an endohedral nitrogen doped fullerene was computed , we describe transport in the incoherent tunneling regime , and proceed to compute the full counting statistics for transport through a molecular quantum dot where the dot electrons have an exchange coupling with an impurity spin .",
    "indeed , in mesoscopic physics , @xcite the current voltage characteristics alone is in general not sufficient to fully characterize transport .",
    "the current fluctuations can provide additional information on the correlations in molecular quantum dot , but so do the higher current moments , or cumulants , such as the `` skewness '' ( third order ) and the `` sharpness '' ( fourth order ) .",
    "such higher order cumulants add up to the so - called full counting statistics ( fcs ) .",
    "@xcite yet here we are interested in obtaining the fcs of such devices using the master equation approach .",
    "@xcite we will also take the opportunity to present in detail the general framework for studying joint distributions of electron occupation of the dot and of current .",
    "a recent work by one of the authors @xcite applied to a single level quantum dot shows that there are clear correlations between current and occupancy of the dot : there , the quantum fluctuations caused by increasing the tunnel coupling to the leads has a definite impact on the number distribution . here",
    "we will extend these concepts to the case of a molecular quantum dot with an impurity spin .",
    "the fcs has remained until recently a highly theoretical concept , with few experimental applications .",
    "the third moment has been measured for a tunnel junction , @xcite as the effects of the measuring apparatus have been pointed out .",
    "@xcite for the regime of incoherent transport through quantum dots two outstanding experiments have been performed : @xcite a point contact is placed in the close vicinity of the quantum dot , and by monitoring the current in this point contact , it is possible to obtain information on the time series of the current in the dot . from this time series , higher moments of the current can be computed .",
    "these recent experiments thus provide additional motivation to study the fcs in this novel system of a molecular quantum dot with an external spin .",
    "this paper thus aims at calculating the fcs of transport through a molecular quantum dot magnet , under the following circumstances :    1 .",
    "the quantum dot is in the strong coulomb blockade regime , i.e. , the system is subject to strong electronic correlation .",
    "the coupling between the dot and the reservoirs is relatively weak , and tunneling of electrons between them can be considered incoherent ( incoherent tunneling regime ) .",
    "3 .   the molecular spin is isotropic , and coupled to the spin of conduction electron through a simple exchange interaction .",
    "assumption ( 2 ) allows us to employ the master equation approach for studying the transport through molecular quantum dot . as assumption",
    "( 1 ) forbids double occupancy on the dot , we consider the cases where the dot is either empty , or occupied by only one conduction electron .    when the dot is empty , the molecular spin @xmath0 , together with its @xmath3-component @xmath4 , is naturally a good quantum number , whereas if the dot is occupied by one conduction electron , then it becomes the total angular momentum @xmath5 which is a good quantum number on the dot .",
    "let us now follow the time evolution of the dot state , e.g. , using a master equation .",
    "the number @xmath6 of conduction electrons on the dot fluctuates in time between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "such transitions are controlled by the so - called rate matrix @xmath9 , which will be more carefully defined in sec .",
    "this rate matrix @xmath9 can be decomposed into @xmath10 charge blocks , corresponding to two charge sectors @xmath11 .",
    "then each block is further characterized by either the molecular spin @xmath4 or the total angular momentum @xmath12 ( and @xmath13 ) depending on whether @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "naturally , off - diagonal blocks of the rate matrix describe transition between different angular momentum states . the rate of such transitions is proportional to the square of a clebsch - gordan coefficient between the initial and the final angular momentum states .    in the master equation approach to fcs",
    ", the derivation of fcs generating function reduces to solving the eigenvalue problem of a modified master equation with counting fields . by using an algebraic identity ,",
    "this eigenvalue problem can be projected down to a slightly more complicated problem within the @xmath7 charge sector , which can be fully characterized by the molecular spin @xmath4 .",
    "our main discovery is that some identities among clebsch - gordan coefficients allow us to identify the desired eigenspace without solving the whole problem . in this reduced problem",
    "clebsch - gordan coefficients appear at quartic order , since off - diagonal blocks are projected , together with the @xmath8 charge sector , down to the @xmath7 subspace .",
    "based on the analytic expressions for the fcs generating function thus obtained , we also developed numerical analysis to perform a contour - plot of the joint charge - current distribution function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the first two sections after introduction are devoted to the preparatory stage ,",
    "i.e. , section ii describes our model for the isotropic molecular quantum dot magnet , while section iii reviews the master equation approach to fcs .",
    "then , in section iv the analytic expressions for the fcs generating function will be obtained , with the help of quartic identities among clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "section v describes the contour plot of joint distribution functions , before the paper is concluded in section vi .",
    "we consider a molecule connected to two electrodes , which are specified by an index @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 corresponds , e.g. , to the left ( @xmath16 to the right ) electrode .",
    "we focus on the strong coulomb blockade regime , assuming that the number of electrons which can be added to the dot is restricted to one .",
    "because the extra - charge electron state on the dot carries a spin , it is locally coupled to the impurity spin on the molecule via an exchange coupling hamiltonian .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath17 of the system consists of two parts : ( i ) the hamiltonian @xmath18 of the isolated parts , and ( ii ) the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath18 can be decomposed further into the dot and lead parts : @xmath21 . for normal metal leads ,",
    "the hamiltonian of left ( @xmath15 ) and right ( @xmath16 ) leads reads , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 annihilates an electron with momentum @xmath24 , spin @xmath25 and energy @xmath26 in the lead @xmath27 .",
    "the tunnel hamiltonian reads : @xmath28 , where the operator @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) annihilates ( creates ) an electron on the single dot level .",
    "the dot hamiltonian reads : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of electrons on the dot level with spin @xmath25 , and @xmath33 is a charging energy contribution related to the capacitance with respect to the leads and to the gate .",
    "it will be assumed to be large in the present work , in order to prohibit double occupancy .",
    "finally , @xmath34 is the coupling of the dot electron spin @xmath35 with the impurity spin @xmath0 .",
    "this is finite , by definition , only when there is an electron on the dot : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the exchange coupling constant .",
    "as expected the eigenstates of this contribution to the hamiltonian are the total angular momentum states of @xmath38 .",
    "this is seen by rewriting the exchange term as @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath7 sector is characterized simply by the spin @xmath0 of the magnetic impurity , and has @xmath40 degenerate states , @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath8 , the coupling @xmath37 between the impurity and the dot electron spins requires to diagonalize the interaction with the total angular momentum states , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "the two spin subsectors , @xmath43 and @xmath44 correspond to an energy eigenvalue of , respectively , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the two subsectors each have a degeneracy of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .    in our model hamiltonian ,",
    "the charging effects are taken into account via the bias - voltage dependence of the position of the dot level @xmath49 with respect to the chemical potentials of the leads , @xmath50 .",
    "a gate voltage @xmath51 and gate capacitance @xmath52 can be included in order to move the dot levels up and down . here",
    "we focus on the case where the bias voltage always dominates on the temperature , so for later purpose it is sufficient to specify which level and how many of these are included in the bias window .",
    "the electron dynamics of transport through a molecular quantum dot in the incoherent tunneling regime can be described by a master equation .",
    "@xcite in such systems as our molecular quantum dot hamiltonian , the master equation describes a stochastic evolution in the space spanned by the eigenstates of the non - perturbed hamiltonian @xmath18 .",
    "such states are , of course , of quantum mechanical nature , but the evolution of the system is governed by a deterministic stochastic process",
    ". jumps between different states are to be stochastic events , and are also to be markovian ( no correlation between successive tunneling events ) .",
    "such a situation is justified in the so - called incoherent tunneling regime , where the the non - perturbed hamiltonian @xmath18 is only weakly perturbed by the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath19 , and the tunneling of electrons through the dot is still considered to be sequential .",
    "a simplification specific to our model is that the lead degrees of freedom can be traced out , and the master equation describes actually the time evolution of the dot states .",
    "we will often denote a ( quantum mechanical ) dot state @xmath53 , simply as @xmath54 in the master equation .",
    "the probability @xmath55 with which the system , i.e. , our molecular quantum dot , finds itself in a state @xmath54 at time @xmath56 satisfies , @xmath57 @xmath58 is the transition probability for a jump , @xmath59 , which can be calculated , e.g. , from fermi s golden rule .",
    "the subscripts @xmath54 and @xmath60 take all the possible values , @xmath61 in the space of physically relevant states .",
    "conservation of probability imposes that the sum of all the components _ in a given column _",
    "@xmath60 of matrix @xmath9 vanishes .",
    "thus @xmath62 denotes the decay rate of a state @xmath54 . in matrix notation , this reads @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , is called the rate matrix . @xmath65 and @xmath66 are , respectively , the diagonal and off - diagonal parts of the rate matrix @xmath9 .    in order to apply fermi s golden rule for evaluating @xmath58",
    ", one must go back to the hamiltonian , @xmath18 of the isolated parts , and one consider the transition rate @xmath67 associated with a tunneling perturbation @xmath19 , from an initial state @xmath68 to a final state @xmath69 : @xmath70 the eigenstates @xmath71 are many electron states , but they factorize into a direct product of many - electron lead states and a dot state .",
    "therefore , after taking into account all the lead degrees of freedom , the above transition rates are rewritten in the form of transition rates between different dot states @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath58 for a transition , @xmath59 .",
    "we also make the standard assumption that the hopping amplitude @xmath73 depends weakly on energy for states close to the fermi levels of the leads . for normal leads it is also spin independent .",
    "thus fermi s golden rule gives basically a bare tunneling rates , defined as @xmath74 , weighted by a clebsch - gordan coefficient squared , which we will discuss later .",
    "@xmath75 is the ( constant ) density of states at the fermi level in the leads .",
    "we also use the explicit notation @xmath76 rather than @xmath27 for specifying the leads .    before giving explicit matrix elements of the rate matrix @xmath9 , it is convenient to decompose it into four blocks , corresponding to the two charge sectors @xmath11 as @xmath77 the off - diagonal block matrices @xmath78 and @xmath79 are rectangular matrices of size , ( i ) @xmath80 and ( ii ) @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "they describe tunneling of an electron either ( i ) out of the dot into one of the reservoirs , or ( ii ) onto the dot from one of the reservoirs . both have two spin sectors , corresponding to two possible values of the total angular momentum @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where the @xmath84 is , for example , a transposed matrix of @xmath79 .",

    "thus we obtained an analytic expression for the cgf _ as a function of the local spin @xmath0 _ for different configurations of the dot states and of the two leads in regard to their relative energy levels ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3states ] ) .    based on the obtained analytic expressions",
    ", we also developed numerical analysis , e.g. , contour plots of the charge - current joint distribution function .",
    "for a small local spin , e.g. , @xmath205 , the obtained contour plots show clearly an asymmetry in the distribution of the charge , i.e. , between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we then demonstrated that this asymmetry grows differently for different cases in fig .",
    "[ fig:3states ] mentioned above . in particular , this asymmetry tends to disappear as the local spin @xmath0 becomes large , in cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:3states ] , indicating that the local spin plays the role of a _ spin bath _ for the conduction electron .",
    "of course , as emphasized in sec .",
    "5 , it is rather counterintuitive to recover such characteristic transport properties of a _ spinless fermion _ in this large @xmath0 limit .",
    "we further demonstrated that such characteristic features of the transport of a spinless fermion , which we believe to have a chance to be realized in reality , e.g. , in a mn@xmath2 molecular quantum dot , are subjective to a direct experimental check through the bias voltage dependence of lowest - order cumulants .",
    "it is interesting to extend our analysis to the case of leads of different nature , such as ferromagnetic leads or superconducting leads .",
    "the range of validity of this work is limited to the incoherent tunneling regime , whereas one might naturally wonder what happens when the coupling between the dot and the leads become stronger .",
    "kondo type physics in such a regime is particularly interesting , @xcite because of the coexistence of an intrinsic magnetic impurity ( molecular spin ) and the quantum dot , the latter known to show enhancement of conductance due to kondo mechanism at low temperatures .",
    "certainly one has to go beyond the master equation approach to fcs in order to treat fcs in such a regime .",

    "for the calculation of fcs for a model with an arbitrary spin @xmath0 we have used extensively the clebsch - gordan algebra .",
    "we , therefore , summarize in the following useful relations among clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "we start with conventional quadratic relations which are sometimes discussed in standard quantum mechanics textbooks , and then proceed to unconventional quartic relations which we discovered as a byproduct of this research .",
    "let us summarize the quadratic identities on the clebsch - gordan coefficients , @xmath336 , for a given @xmath0 and @xmath337 .",

    "if one sums up the two coefficients squared given in either of the two rows in table ii ( as we did for table i ) , one finds this time , @xmath342 if we focus on a particular term in the above summation , for which @xmath4 is given , then @xmath241 is determined automatically by the constraint @xmath243 .",
