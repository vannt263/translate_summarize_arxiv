    "the problem of subharmonic bifurcations was first considered by melnikov @xcite , who showed that the existence of subharmonic solutions is related to the zeroes of a suitable function , nowadays called the subharmonic melnikov function .",
    "the standard melnikov theory usually studies the case in which the subharmonic melnikov function has a simple ( i.e. first order ) zero @xcite .",
    "in such a case the problem can be reduced to a problem of implicit function theorem .",
    "nonetheless , it can happen that the subharmonic melnikov function either vanishes identically or has a zero which is of order higher than one .",
    "in the first case hopefully one can go to higher orders , and if a suitable higher order generalisation of the subharmonic melnikov function has a first order zero , then one can proceed very closely to the standard case , and existence of analytic subharmonic solutions is obtained .",
    "most of the papers in the literature consider this kind of generalisations of melnikov s theory , and often a second order analysis is enough to settle the problem .",
    "the second case is more subtle .",
    "the problem can be still reduced to an implicit function problem , but the fact that the zeroes are no longer simple prevents us from applying the implicit function theorem .",
    "thus , other arguments must be used , based on the weierstrass preparation theorem and on the theory of the puiseux series @xcite .",
    "however , a systematic analysis is missing in the literature .",
    "furthermore , in general , these arguments are not constructive : if on the one hand they allow to prove ( in certain cases ) the existence of at least one subharmonic solution , on the other hand the problem of how many such solutions really exist and how they can be explicitly constructed has not been discussed in full generality .",
    "the main difficulty for a constructive approach is that the solution of the implicit function equation has to be looked for by successive approximations . at each iteration step , in order to find the correction to the approximate solution found at the previous one , one has to solve a new implicit function equation , which , in principle , still admits multiple roots .",
    "so , as far as the roots of the equations are not simple , one can not give an algorithm to produce systematically the corrections at the subsequent steps .",
    "a careful discussion of a problem of the same kind can be found in @xcite , where the problem of bifurcations from multiple limit cycles is considered  cf .",
    "also @xcite , where the problem is further investigated . there",
    ", under the hypothesis that a simple ( real ) zero is obtained at the first iteration step , it is proved that the bifurcating solutions can be expanded as fractional series ( puiseux series ) of the perturbation parameter . the method to compute the coefficients of the series",
    "is based on the use of newton s polygon @xcite , and allows one to go to arbitrarily high orders . however , the convergence of the series , and hence of the algorithm , relies on abstract arguments of algebraic and geometric theory .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the case of subharmonic bifurcations was not discussed in the literature .",
    "of course , in principle one can think to adapt the same strategy as in @xcite for the bifurcations of limit cycles .",
    "but still , there are issues which have not been discussed there .",
    "moreover we have a twofold aim .",
    "we are interested in results which are both general  not generic  and constructive .",
    "this means that we are interested in problems such as the following one : which are the weaker conditions to impose on the perturbation , for a given integrable system and a given periodic solution , in order to prove the existence of subharmonic solutions ?",
    "of course the ideal result would be to have no restriction at all . at the same time",
    ", we are also interested in explicitly construct such solutions , within any prefixed accuracy .    the problem of subharmonic solutions in the case of multiple zeroes of the melnikov functions has been considered in @xcite , where the following theorem is stated ( without giving the proof ) for @xmath0 smooth systems : if the subharmonic melnikov function has a zero of order @xmath1 , then there is at least one subharmonic solution . in any case",
    "the analyticity properties of the solutions are not discussed .",
    "in particular the subharmonic solution is found as a function of two parameters  the perturbation parameter and the initial phase of the solution to be continued  , but the relation between the two parameters is not discussed .",
    "we note that , in the analytic setting , it is exactly this relation which produces the lack of analyticity in the perturbation parameter .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite the case of zeroes of even order is not considered : as we shall see , in that case the existence of subharmonic solutions can not be proved in general , but it can be obtained under extra assumptions .    in the remaining part of this section , we give a more detailed account of our results .",
    "one can formulate the problem both in the @xmath0 whitney topology and in the real - analytic setting .",
    "we shall choose the latter .",
    "from a technical point of view , this is mandatory since our techniques requires for the systems to be analytic .",
    "however , it is also very natural from a physical point of view , because in practice in any physical applications the functions appearing in the equations are analytic ( often even polynomials ) , and when they are not analytic they are not even smooth . also , we note since now that , even though we restrict our analysis to the analytic setting , this does not mean at all that we can not deal with problems where non - analytic phenomena arise .",
    "the very case discussed in this paper provides a counterexample .    we shall consider systems which can be viewed as perturbations of integrable systems , with the perturbation which depends periodically in time .",
    "we shall use coordinates @xmath2 such that , in the absence of the perturbation , @xmath3 is fixed to a constant value , while @xmath4 rotates on the circle : hence all motions are periodic . as usual @xcite",
    "we assume that , for @xmath3 varying in a finite interval , the periods change monotonically .",
    "then we can write the equations of motion as @xmath5 , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 periodic in @xmath4 and @xmath8 .",
    "all functions are assumed to be analytic .",
    "more formal definitions will be given in section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "given a unperturbed periodic orbit @xmath9 , we define the subharmonic melnikov function @xmath10 as the average over a period of the function @xmath11 . by construction @xmath10",
    "is periodic in @xmath12 . with the terminology introduced above",
    ", @xmath13 is the perturbation parameter and @xmath12 is the initial phase .",
    "the following scenario arises .    *",
    "if @xmath10 has no zero , then there is no subharmonic solution , that is no periodic solution which continues the unperturbed one at @xmath14 . * otherwise , if @xmath10 has zeroes , the following two cases are possible : either @xmath10 has a zero of finite order @xmath15 or @xmath10 vanishes with all its derivatives . in the second case , because of analyticity , the function @xmath10 is identically zero . *",
    "if @xmath10 has a simple zero ( i.e. @xmath16 ) , then the usual melnikov s theory applies . in particular there",
    "exists at least one subharmonic solution , and it is analytic in the perturbation parameter @xmath13 . *",
    "if @xmath10 has a zero of order @xmath15 , then in general no result can be given about the existence of subharmonic solutions .",
    "however one can introduce an infinite sequence of polynomial equations , which are defined iteratively : if the first equation admits a real non - zero root and all the following equations admit a real root , then a subharmonic solution exists , and it is a function analytic in suitable fractional power of @xmath13 ; more precisely it is analytic in @xmath17 , for some @xmath18 , and hence it is analytic in @xmath19 . if at some step the root is simple , an algorithm can be given in order to construct recursively all the coefficients of the series .",
    "* if we further assume that the order @xmath15 of the zero is odd , then we have that all the equations of the sequence satisfy the request made above on the roots , so that we can conclude that in such a case at least one subharmonic solution exists .",
    "again , in order to really construct the solution , by providing an explicit recursive algorithm , we need that at a certain level of the iteration scheme a simple root appears .",
    "* moreover we have at most @xmath15 periodic solutions bifurcating from the unperturbed one with initial phase @xmath12 .",
    "of course , to count all subharmonic solutions we have also to sum over all the zeroes of the subharmonic melnikov function .",
    "* finally , if @xmath10 vanishes identically as a function of @xmath12 , then we have to extend the analysis up to second order , and all the cases discussed above for @xmath10 have to repeated for a suitable function @xmath20 , which is obtained in the following way .",
    "if @xmath21 then the solution @xmath22 is defined up to first order  as it is easy to check  , so that one can expand the function @xmath23 up to first order : we call @xmath20 its average over a period of the unperturbed solution . in particular",
    "if also @xmath20 vanishes identically then one can push the perturbation theory up to second order , and , after expanding the function @xmath23 up to second order , one defines @xmath24 as its average over a period , and so on .",
    "the first conclusion we can draw is that in general we can not say that for any vector field @xmath25 there is at least one subharmonic solution of given period .",
    "we need some condition on @xmath26 .",
    "we can require for @xmath26 to be a zero - mean function , so that it has at least one zero of odd order .",
    "for instance , this holds true if the vector field is hamiltonian , since in such a case @xmath26 is the @xmath27-derivative of a suitable function .",
    "the same result follows if the equations describe a hamiltonian system in the presence of small friction  how small depends on the particular resonance one is looking at @xcite .",
    "but of course , all these conditions are stronger than what is really needed .",
    "a second conclusion is that , even when a subharmonic solution turns out to exist ( and to be analytic in a suitable fractionary power of the perturbation parameter ) , a constructive algortithm to compute it within any given accuracy can not be provided in general .",
    "this becomes possible only if some further assumption is made .",
    "so there are situations where one can obtain an existence result of the solution , but the solutin itself can not be constructed .",
    "note that such situations are highly non - generic , because they arise if one finds at each iterative step a polynomial with multiple roots  which is a non - generic case ; cf .",
    "appendix [ app : a ] .",
    "the methods we shall use to prove the results above will be of two different types .",
    "we shall rely on standard general techniques , based on the weierstrass preparation theorem , in order to show that under suitable assumptions the solutions exist and to prove in this case the convergence of the series .",
    "moreover , we shall use a combination of the newton - puiseux process and the diagrammatic techniques based on the tree formalism @xcite in order to provide a recursive algorithm , when possible . note that in such a case the convergence of the puiseux series follows by explicit construction of the coefficients , and an explicit bound of the radius of convergence is obtained through the estimates of the coefficients  on the contrary",
    "there is no way to provide quantitative bounds with the aforementioned abstract arguments .",
    "these results extend those in @xcite , where a special case was considered .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we formulate rigorously the problem of subharmonic bifurcations for analytic ordinary differential equations in the plane , and show that , if the subharmonic melnikov function admits a finite order zero , the problem can be reduced to an analytic implicit equation problem  analyticity will be proved in section [ sec:5 ] by using the tree formalism . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we discuss the newton - puiseux process , which will be used to iteratively attack the problem . at each iteration step one",
    "has to solve a polynomial equation .",
    "thus , in the complex setting @xcite the process can be pushed forward indefinitely , whereas in the real setting one has to impose at each step that a real root exists .",
    "if the order of zero of the subharmonic melnikov function is odd , the latter condition is automatically satisfied , and hence the existence of at least one subharmonic solution is obtained ( theorem [ thm:1 ] ) . if at some step of the iteration a simple root appears , then we can give a fully constructive algorithm which allows us to estimate the radius of analyticity and to approximate the solution within any fixed accuracy ( theorem [ thm:2 ] ) .",
    "this second result will be proved in sections [ sec:4 ] and [ sec:6 ] , again by relying on the tree formalism ; some more technical aspects of the proof will be dealt with in appendix [ app : b ] .",
    "finally in section [ sec:7 ] we consider the case in which the subharmonic melnikov function vanishes identically , so that one has to repeat the analysis for suitable higher order generalisations of that function .",
    "this will lead to theorems [ thm:3 ] and [ thm:4 ] , which generalise theorems [ thm:2 ] and [ thm:1 ] , respectively .",
    "let us consider the ordinary differential equation \\{&=(a)+f(,a , t ) , + & = g(,a , t ) , [ eq:2.1].where @xmath28 , with @xmath29 an open set , the map @xmath30 is real analytic in @xmath3 , and the functions @xmath31 depend analytically on their arguments and are @xmath32-periodic in @xmath4 and @xmath8 .",
