    "the use of @xmath7co and its isotopologues rotational lines to measure h@xmath5 gas mass and physical properties in galaxies is now a well - established technique ( e.g. dickman et al . 1986 ; elmegreen 1989 ; bryant & scoville 1996 ) employed successfully throughout the local universe ( z@xmath11 ) ( e.g. sanders , scoville & soifer 1991 ; young & scoville 1991 ; solomon et al . 1992",
    "; downes & solomon 1998 ) and at increasingly high redshifts ( e.g. brown & vanden bout 1991 ; downes et al .",
    "1992 ; omont et al . 1996",
    "; frayer et al . 1998 ) . in high - z observations",
    "usually only high - j co lines @xmath12 , ( @xmath13 ) are accessible for evaluating the mass and physical conditions of h@xmath5 gas , thus omitting cooler ( @xmath14 k ) and/or sub - thermally excited gas ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "recently observations of the lowest @xmath7co j=10 , 21 transitions in several high redshift objects have been made possible with the very large array ( e.g. carilli , menten , & yun 1999 ; carilli et al .",
    "2002a , 2002b ) and in some cases thermalized transitions up to fairly high rotational levels ( e.g. j=54 ) have been observed .",
    "however , differential lensing can complicate standard interpretation of line ratios by preferentially amplifying the emission of the usually more spatially confined warm and dense gas ( e.g. blain 1999 ) yielding the false impression that such gas properties ( and the thermalization of high - j co transitions ) characterize the bulk of the molecular gas in such systems",
    ". in one case of an unlensed high - z starburst large scale sub - thermal excitation of @xmath4co j=54 has been inferred ( papadopoulos & ivison 2002 ) .",
    "another limitation of the standard method is encountered in tracing metal - poor h@xmath5 gas , which becomes more severe in enhanced fuv radiation fields : the reduced dust - shielding and co self - shielding allows uv photons to dissociate co while leaving the mostly self - shielding h@xmath5 intact ( maloney & black 1988 ; israel 1988 , 1997 ) .",
    "this is now corroborated by observations of the metal - poor outer parts of typical spirals ( nakai & kuno 1995 ; arimoto , sofue , & tsujimoto 1996 ) , globally metal - poor objects like the magellanic clouds and magellanic irregulars ( e.g. madden et al .",
    "1997 ) , and blue compact dwarf galaxies ( e.g. barone et al . 2000 ) .",
    "unfortunately both types of the aforementioned bias can hinder efforts to measure h@xmath5 gas mass at high redshifts since high-@xmath16 @xmath4co lines are those used most often , and significant amounts of metal - poor gas reside in uv - intense environments ( e.g. in ly - break galaxies ) .",
    "the ci j=10 line was one of the first photodissociation region ( pdr ) lines to be detected from molecular clouds ( phillips & huggins 1981 ) , yet its h@xmath5 tracing potential has gone unnoticed .",
    "there are three main reasons for that namely , a ) the low atmospheric transmission at its rest - frame frequency of @xmath17 ghz precluded , until recently , routine observations of molecular clouds in this transition , b ) instrumentation constraints in terms of receiver sensitivity and the ability to map large areas fast ( no multi - beam receivers available ) , and c ) an early theoretical prejudice of one - dimensional steady - state pdr models that pictured ci distributed only in a relatively narrow cii / ci / co transition zone on the surface of fuv - illuminated molecular clouds ( e.g. tielens & hollenbach 1985a , b ) and thus unable to trace the bulk of their mass .",
    "interestingly this prejudice was at times reinforced by the instrumentation and atmospheric restrictions which allowed only limited mapping of ci emission , which in turn was mainly conducted in regions where theory predicted ci should  be .",
    "these early views on the ci distribution in pdrs could explain some general features of its emission such as the surprising robustness of the ci j=10 line brightness over a wide range of fuv intensities and metallicities ( e.g. kaufman 1999 ) .",
    "this simple picture is now challenged by two large scale ci surveys of the orion a and b molecular clouds ( ikeda et al .",
    "2002 ) and the galactic center ( ojha et al . 2001 ) that find ci , @xmath7co , and @xmath18co j=10 emission to be fully co - extensive , their intensities tightly correlated , and with a surprisingly constant @xmath19 ratio over dramatic changes in ambient fuv field and physical conditions .",
    "these observations along with a considerable body of similar past observational evidence ( see keene 1997 for a review ) point to a ci distribution fully concomitant with that of co. the present work uses time - varying chemical models under typical conditions found in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) to further elucidate this issue , and then examines the potential of ci line emission as an h@xmath5 mass tracer .",
    "we focus mainly on the following issues ,    \\1 ) the current state of the art of ci observations revealing its distribution throughout molecular clouds ( thus allowing it to be a tracer of their mass ) , and the role of non - equilibrium and/or dynamic processes as well as cosmic rays under typical ism conditions .",
    "\\2 ) the expected ci line flux densities over a range of physical conditions and their relative observational advantage ( if any ) with respect to the @xmath4co transitions .",
    "\\3 ) the uncertainties of h@xmath5 mass estimates from ci emission with respect to those associated with the standard method employing co lines , as well as the observational prospects of using the ci lines to trace molecular gas at high redshifts .    throughout this work ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath20 cosmology with @xmath21 .",
    "in an early attempt to account for the mounting number of observations finding ci to be more extended than predicted by the models ( e.g. keene et al . 1985 ) low density pdrs ( @xmath22 @xmath23 ) have been advocated . there",
    "the ci abundance in the cii / ci / co transition zone becomes larger ( @xmath24/ [   ^{12}co]\\sim 1 - 100 $ ] ) than in denser ones ( @xmath25 ) because a different , ci - rich , chemical route is favored , allowing ci to dominate over a larger region of the cloud , @xmath26 ( hollenbach , takahashi , & tielens 1991 ) .",
    "more realistic inhomogeneous pdr models showed a deeper fuv penetration and a more pervasive ci emission `` coating '' the clumps making up the gmcs ( meixner & tielens  1993 ; spaans & van dishoeck  1997 ) .",
    "the aforementioned schemes can produce a _ spatial _ correlation between ci emission and that of h@xmath5 mass tracers like the @xmath27co , @xmath28co j=21 , 10 transitions but can not readily explain their tight _ intensity _ correlation ( keene et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the latter is surprising because e.g. a ci/@xmath29co intensity ratio should depend on quantities like the surface - layer to total cloud mass ratio , the different ambient excitation conditions of the two species ( even in clumped pdrs ci and @xmath29co still reside in different volumes ) , all expected to vary strongly within a molecular cloud and between clouds . the discovery of significant ci emission deep in uv - protected sites of cold dark clouds in the galaxy ( e.g. oka et al .",
    "2001 ) , and m 31 ( israel , tilanus , & baas 1998 ) makes the standard steady - state pdr interpetation ( with typical cosmic ray fluxes ) even more difficult . in the few cases where ci j=21 is also detected , the ci ( 21)/(10 ) ratio yields ( in lte ) similar gas temperatures to those deduced solely from the @xmath4co lines or fir / sub - mm dust continuum in either starburst or quiescent environments ( stutzki et al .",
    "1997 and references  therein ) .",
    "finally the striking similarity of ci and @xmath29co line profiles in the latest large scale survey by ikeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggests a spatial and intensity correlation continuing to still smaller scales than those probed by the nominal resolution of the particular observations of @xmath30 pc ( assuming macroscopic motions of much smaller , radiatively - decoupled `` cells '' responsible for line - formation in gmcs , see e.g. tauber 1996 ) . _",
    "the simplest explanation of all the aforementioned observational results is that ci and co are fully concomitant and trace the same h@xmath5 gas mass . _",
    "non - equilibrium chemical processes can maintain a high [ ci]/[@xmath27co ] in cloud regions that have not attained chemical equilibrium ( e.g. de boisanger & chize 1991 ; lee et al .",
    "1996 ; strzer , stutzki , & sternberg 1997 ) , or have done so under turbulent diffusive `` mixing '' of a ci - rich cloud envelope with its deeper regions ( xie , allen , & langer 1995 ; xie  1997 ) .",
    "the most recent investigation of the time dependance of the [ c]/[@xmath4co ] ratio and the resulting ci line intensities by storzer et al .",
    "examines the effects of abrupt changes of a strong local fuv field intensity ( @xmath31 ) caused by cloud - cloud shadowing over timescales of @xmath32  yrs .    in the present work",
    "we assume ambient conditions expected for the bulk of the molecular gas in gmcs rather than in their few o , b star - illuminated hot / dense spots .",
    "these conditions consists of : a ) initially atomic clouds ( the likely precursors of gmcs ) , b ) softer ambient fuv fields , and c ) a larger range of gas densities .",
    "moreover , processes other than cloud - cloud shadowing govern the evolution of gmcs and their ambient conditions , with timescales short enough to allow them to maintain a high [ c]/[@xmath4co ] ratio throughout the volume of a typical gmc during its lifetime .    in the case of chemical",
    "processes the h@xmath5 formation timescale provides a good approximation for an overall equilibrium to be reached in a molecular cloud that is initially atomic ( e.g. hollenbach & tielens 1999 ) .",
    "this timescale  is    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the average h density and @xmath35 is the canonical h@xmath5 formation rate on dust grains ( e.g. jura 1975 ) . for @xmath36 @xmath23 and @xmath37  k ( typical for the cold neutral medium hi out of which gmcs form )",
    ", it is @xmath38  yrs . on the other hand , the dynamic evolution timescale is    @xmath39    ( spherical cloud assumed ) .",
    "this is comparable to @xmath40 and is in accordance with the well known fact that timescales of @xmath41  yrs characterize a wide variety of processes that fully disrupt or otherwise drastically alter typical gmcs . some of the most important ones are star formation with the disruptive effects of o , b , star clusters ( e.g. bash , green , & peters 1977 ) , turbulent dissipation ( stone , ostriker , & gammie 1998 ; maclow et al .",
    "1998 ) , and inter - cloud clump - clump collisions ( blitz & shu 1980 ) .",
    "the fact that these timescales are shorter or comparable to @xmath42 suggests that molecular clouds may never reach chemical  equilibrium .    driven by the evolution of continuously forming stellar populations throughout a galaxy , the _ average _ fuv field regulating the cii / ci / co transition zone in stationary pdr models also varies .",
    "recent work by parravano , hollenbach & mckee ( 2003 ) has shown    @xmath43    to be the typical time needed for a significant perturbation of the fuv energy density to occur , where @xmath44 , u is the fuv energy density , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the star formation rate normalized to its solar neighborhood value . for",
    "e.g. @xmath47 it is @xmath48 , comparable to @xmath42 even in quiescent environments ( @xmath49 ) .    in order to track the evolution of the [ c]/[@xmath4co ] ratio during the aforementioned timescales we present results from our homogeneous , time - dependent pdr models in figure 1 .",
    "the chemistry of gas is represented over a semi - infinite slab , taking into account all the heating and cooling processes ( see papadopoulos , thi , & viti 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "we have also included the latest advancements in collisional / reaction rates and chemical networks which now include most charge - exchange reactions .",
    "the latter are particularly important in the proper estimate of the [ c]/[@xmath4co ] values in heavily shielded , cosmic ray - dominated environments with various metallicities ( sections 2.2 , 2.3 ) .",
    "the diagrams in figure 1 confirm that the [ ci]/[@xmath7co ] equilibrium timescale and @xmath50 ( equation 2 ) remain comparable throughout the density range examined .",
    "hence , since self - gravity is the plausible main `` driver '' behind many processes altering the physical conditions of a gmc ( e.g. star formation ; elmegreen 2002 ) , it can be argued that [ ci]/[@xmath4co ] remains significant , never settling to its ( small ) equilibrium values throughout its lifetime . in more active star forming environments all processes that disrupt gmcs or alter their ambient conditions operate on still shorter timescales .",
    "the effect of higher star formation rates is easily highlighted by equation 3 since for @xmath51 , @xmath52 simply becomes proportionally  shorter .    in the absence of a generally accepted gmc formation and destruction",
    "theory the most general way to view the effects of elevated star formation on chemical equilibrium is by assuming that star formation powers the cycling of interstellar gas between the warm , cold hi ( wnm , cnm ) , and the molecular gas phases",
    ". then the gas condensation rate @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the mass fraction per logarithmic density interval ( lioure & chize 1990 ) .",
    "clearly , irrespective of the particular physical processes defining @xmath55 , a higher @xmath56 induces a faster evolution of any given gas `` parcel '' across the entire mass - density spectrum of the neutral ism , leaving less time for it to reach chemical  equilibrium at any one phase .",
    "a relatively recent observational result that is particularly hard to reconcile with steady - state models was obtained by the extensive ci j=10 and @xmath4co j=43 imaging of the carina molecular clouds where a close spatial association of their emission throughout the cloud was found , suggesting that the same gas emits both lines ( zhang et al .",
    "low density pdrs ( @xmath57 @xmath58 ) would be ci - rich and bright in ci j=10 but not in the @xmath7co j=43 transition that has @xmath59 , while in the bi - stability scenario ( section 2.2 ) a locally much higher cr flux ( so that @xmath60 ) would be needed to explain such  association .",
    "turbulent diffusion can smooth any initial [ ci]/[@xmath4co ] abundance gradient so that it becomes almost constant throughout a typical cloud , and in the carinae molecular complex the clouds are found to be warmer than typical ones in the disk , suggestive of turbulent velocity field dissipation ( zhang et al .",
    "the effects of turbulent diffusion on elemental abundances have been outlined by xie , allen , & langer ( 1995 ) ( see also xie 1997 for a review ) , and here we will only point out the effects in the kinematically violent environments found in e.g. galactic centers and merger systems . in such regions molecular clouds have very high velocity dispersions , typically @xmath61 for the galactic center ( e.g. oka et al .",
    "1996 ) , that can reach up to @xmath62 in the extreme ulirg merger systems ( albeit model - dependent , e.g. downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "these are much higher than @xmath63 found for gmcs in the kinematically quiescent spiral disks .",
    "these large line widths in kinematically violent environment correspond to a turbulent diffusion coefficient @xmath64 , ( assuming @xmath65 and an invariant characteristic length scale l ) .",
    "this is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude larger than in kinematically quiescent environments and can easily yield a constant [ c]/[@xmath7co]@xmath66 ratio throughout the cloud ( xie et al .",
    "the diffusion timescales are short , e.g. for quiescent gmcs @xmath67  yrs , which is shortened to @xmath68 in dynamically active environments ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "such effects , and a potentially large cosmic ray flux ( section 2.3 ) , can easily account for the significant [ ci]/[@xmath4co ] ratios found in dark and dense clouds , shielded from the ambient fuv radiation by very large extinctions ( e.g. ikeda et al . 2002 ) , as well as the similarity of ci j=10 and hco@xmath70 j=10 , 32 , cs j=21 line profiles ( stark et al .",
    "1997 ; johansson et al .",
    "the latter are particularly puzzling since in shielded environments hco@xmath70 is a product of dense , dark cloud chemistry , and its j=32 transition has @xmath71  @xmath23 which , along with cs j=21 ( @xmath72 ) , imply very dense gas for which standard pdr models predict @xmath7co to be the dominant carbon - bearing species  ( @xmath73/ [ ^{12}co]<10^{-3}$ ] ) .",
    "turbulence has the strength and the time to redistribute any ci - rich , pdr - origin gas phase initially located in a cloud envelope throughout its denser and uv - shielded interior within  its  lifetime .",
    "the previous brief exposition of time - dependent chemical and dynamic phenomena suggests that _ except in few of their densest , most uv - protected and kinematically quiescent regions , gmcs may never attain chemical equilibrium while turbulence is capable of `` mixing '' the resulting ci - rich gas phase throughout their volume _",
    ", a situation accentuated in star forming and/or dynamically active environments .    in star forming environments the expected larger cosmic ray flux will also raise the [ ci]/[@xmath4co ] ratio deep inside a cloud s volume , and several observations have indeed found a systematically larger [ ci]/[@xmath4co ] ratio in starburst nuclei ( e.g. harrison et al . 1995",
    "; israel & baas 2002 ) . in the starburst m 82 , bright ci j=10 emission with @xmath74",
    "is measured over the bulk of its h@xmath5 gas ( schilke et al .",
    "1993 ; white et al . 1994 ) while the cr flux in its central regions is @xmath75 ( suchkov , allen , & heckman  1993 ) .    in figure 2 the effect of @xmath76 on the ci distribution",
    "is presented , and the cr - induced [ ci]/[@xmath7co ] enhancement throughout a cloud becomes apparent ( see also flower et al .",
    "1994 for early such work ) . indeed in the dark cloud conditions prevailing deep into the inner regions of gmcs a pure pdr origin of ci becomes unattainable but cosmic rays , unlike ultraviolet photons ,",
    "penetrate deep into clouds and at high @xmath77 control both thermal balance and chemistry .",
    "such a chemistry can still yield a steady - state ci - rich gas phase , provided @xmath78 .",
    "this `` turnover '' density increases for higher @xmath79 and marks a cr - controlled bi - stability of the chemical network set by the abrupt transition between two possible ism ionization states ( des forts , roueff , & flower 1992 ; le bourlot , des forts , & roueff 1993 ; flower et al .",
    "for @xmath78 the gas has a high ionization fraction and thus a high @xmath80 dissociative recombination , allowing h@xmath70 to be the dominant ion and initiate a set of chemical reactions that yield @xmath73/ [ ^{12}co]\\sim 0.1 - 0.2 $ ] . for @xmath81 ,",
    "@xmath80 becomes dominant and a different chemical network yields a much lower @xmath24/ [ ^{12}co]\\la 10^{-3}$ ] .",
    "for the galaxy it is @xmath82 ( schilke et al .",
    "1993 and references therein ) , encompassing a large fraction of the molecular gas in  gmcs .",
    "for totally shielded environments ( @xmath83 ) and @xmath84 our models yield @xmath24/ [ ^{12}co]\\ga   3 $ ] for @xmath85 , and @xmath86/ [   ^{12}co]\\leq   0.02 $ ] for @xmath87 .",
    "a ten - fold increase in @xmath88 boosts the aforementioned densities by an order of magnitude , for similar [ c]/[@xmath27co ] values .",
    "these values are in good accordance with those reported in the literature even though controversies remain and a major benchmarking effort of the various pdr codes is under way . in an important recent development",
    "the canonical value of @xmath79 in quiescent diffuse clouds in the solar neighborhood may have to be revised upwards by a factor of @xmath89 ( mccall et al .",
    "2003 ) thus opening up the possibility of a mainly cr - origin of the ci emission observed to be widely distributed in the quiescent molecular clouds in the disk of the galaxy .    in figure 3",
    "we explore the same effects but now scale _ both _ the cr flux and the fuv ambient radiation field , since their _ average _ values are expected to rise in tandem in realistic star forming environments . in this case",
    "enhanced cii production at large fuv intensities limits the cloud volume where ci is dominant , but except for diffuse gas irradiated by strong fields , ci remains the dominant form of carbon for @xmath90 .      the expected evolution of metallicity in galaxies with an overall trend of lower values at earlier epochs is now verified by numerous observations ( e.g. mehlert et al .",
    "2002 ) . a trend of higher star formation rates in galaxies at higher redshifts is also deduced , although the details are far from clear ( e.g. ellis 2001 ; somerville , primack , & faber 2001 ) .",
    "it is therefore anticipated that galaxies with low metallicity and elevated star formation rates ( and thus fuv and cr flux ) , will be common at high redshifts .",
    "ly - break galaxies found at @xmath91 with moderate star formation rates of @xmath92 ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) , and sub - solar metallicities ( e.g. pettini et al .",
    "2000 ) are typical such objects .    in low - metallicity environments with pervasive fuv radiation powered by star formation",
    ", the enhanced co photodissociation diminishes its spatial extent per molecular cloud and thus its h@xmath5-tracing capability ( pak et al .",
    "1998 ; bolatto , jackson , & ingalls 1999 ) .",

    "1997 ; bolatto et al .",
    "2000a ) . these data , albeit sparse and with a large dispersion , suggest @xmath93 , supported also by observations in the low - metallicity star forming irregular ic  10 ( bolatto et al .",
    "2000b and references therein ) .    in figure 4",
    "the effects of such conditions on the ci distribution in solar and sub - solar metallicity environments are contrasted , and it can be seen that ci remains the dominant form of carbon for the bulk of the cloud ( @xmath94 ) even in the metal - poor case . _",
    "thus in the metal - poor and modestly fuv - enhanced environments , characterizing many galaxies at high redshifts , ci remains a good tracer of molecular gas mass .",
    "_    a large change is seen however in the distribution of cii that now , unlike in the metal - rich case , it becomes more abundant than co even deep into the cloud ( yet still less than ci ) .",
    "apart from the enhanced fuv photoinization of ci at low @xmath95 s , caused by the reduced dust shielding , low metallicity further enhances cii at the deeper parts of such clouds at the expense of co because the main route of co destruction at high @xmath77 is via the reaction path : @xmath96 once formed , ionized carbon will capture an electron from a metal atom in the gas phase but at low metallicities the charge exchange reactions involving the metallic atoms and ions are less efficient in converting c@xmath70 into c while he@xmath70 is formed in large abundance by the larger cosmic rays flux and thus a significant part of the carbon will be in the form of cii even at large @xmath97 s .",
    "the critical densities of the fine structure ci lines @xmath98@xmath1 ( @xmath99  ghz ) and @xmath100@xmath3 ( @xmath101 ghz ) are @xmath102 @xmath23 and @xmath103 @xmath23 , comparable to those of the widely observed @xmath4co j=10 , 21 transitions , while their upper energy levels are @xmath104  k , and @xmath105  k. the velocity - integrated flux density of a line is    @xmath106    where @xmath107 is the luminosity distance for a redshift z , @xmath108 is the area / velocity - integrated line brightness temperature ( in k km sec@xmath109 pc@xmath110 ) , and @xmath111 its rest - frame frequency .",
    "hence , for any of the ci j=10 , 21 and the @xmath4co j+1@xmath112j lines the velocity - integrated flux density ratio is    @xmath113    where @xmath114 , and @xmath115 for @xmath116co .",
    "the brightness temperature averages are over velocity and emitting area .",
    "an unresolved ( or barely resolved ) object , whose various ism lines are accessible by a multiplicity of receivers , will have an observed ci flux density larger by the @xmath117 factor relative to that of lower frequency co transitions .",
    "interferometric scaled - array observations ` synthesizing ' the same beamsize at widely different frequencies while utilizing the same collecting area maintain this advantage in the case of resolved objects .",
    "a flux density advantage of a ci line may remain even when @xmath118 , simply because ci lines are much easier to excite and thus can maintain their intensities intact for diffuse and cooler gas while the @xmath119 ratios diminish ( see also kaufman 1999 ) .",
    "for example the @xmath7co j=43 and j=76 lines have critical densities @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , @xmath123 , all much higher than the corresponding quantities of the ci j=10 , 21 lines emitted at similar  frequencies .",
    "thus for any _ detected @xmath4co j+1@xmath112j ( j+1@xmath1243 ) line , bright ci emission may also be present , particularly for sub - thermally excited , and/or cooler gas ( low @xmath125)_. this is of particular importance for the mounting number of high redshift ( z@xmath1262 ) co detections , where only the @xmath127 lines are usually observed while for such redshifts the ci lines no longer undergo large atmospheric absorption .    in table 1",
    "we summarize the typical brightness temperature line ratios measured in various ism environments in the local universe gleaned from an extensive search in the literature .",

    "the ci j=10 line has a clear advantage over @xmath4co transitions in quiescent environments and maintains a sizable one in starbursts .",
    "the ci @xmath152 is the only line in the molecular ism that maintains high @xmath150 at such high frequencies under most conditions , a conclusion subject to the uncertainty of the assumed @xmath153 ratio which has not been widely measured . for metal - poor starbursts figure  5 can be somewhat misleading since in such environments cii may dominate over the bulk of the molecular gas mass with both the @xmath4co and ci lines being rather weak .",
    "nevertheless in the case of a _ detected _ @xmath4co line in such an environment , ci line emission is expected to be bright as  well .    it must be emphasized that @xmath131 values translate to a practical observational advantage provided the relevant lines do not fall near any of the ( many ) atmospheric absorption windows within the @xmath154 ghz frequency range , and that the set of @xmath4co , ci lines under comparison is accessible within this frequency interval .",
    "the latter implies redshifts of @xmath155 and @xmath156 so that the ci j=10 , 21 lines fall within the aforementioned range .",
    "a _ single _ receiver observing various molecular ism lines redshifted within its tuning range from several objects distributed over a redshift range is a case more relevant to current instrumentation capabilities ( limited set of receivers per telescope ) and blank field spectral line surveys to be conducted with future instruments per observing band ( e.g. blain et al .",
    ". then equation  8 is no longer relevant and one has to simply look at equation 7 and the expression in the brackets which changes @xmath157 for @xmath158 .",
    "this allows @xmath4co , ci lines to trace similar amounts of gas mass over a progressively larger redshift range as long as sufficiently excited lines with progressively larger rest - frame frequencies become accessible .",
    "this is simply the spectral - line equivalent of the well - known favorable k - correction that keeps the fir / sub - mm dust continuum of galaxies undiminished ( and thus detectable ) over a large range of redshifts .",
    "for @xmath7co lines this is beautifully demonstrated by @xmath4co j=@xmath159 observations of nearby qsos that measure h@xmath5 masses similar to those found in high redshift qsos and radio galaxies detected through higher - j @xmath4co lines ( evans et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "studies examining the luminosity of molecular and atomic ism lines in the context of emission - line searches at high redshifts ( e.g. blain et al .",
    "2000 ) do not explore the h@xmath5-tracing potential of the ci lines .",
    "moreover , by making favorable assumptions about the gas excitation they present optimistic predictions of flux densities , particularly for high - j @xmath7co transitions .",
    "this is why some of their brightness temperature line ratios are unrealistic , e.g. ci @xmath160 ( table 1 in blain et al .",
    "2000 ) , while the highest value observed to date is @xmath161 , in m  82 ( stutzki et al .",
    "1997 ) and the orion kl region ( yamamoto  2001 ) .",
    "there is no reason to believe that the variety of environments indicated in figure 5 will not be also present at high redshifts . even if starburst environments are more frequently encountered there , the possibility of large scale sub - thermal excitation as suggested by recent measurements in the extremely red object ( ero ) and starburst hr  10 at @xmath162 ( greve et al .",
    "2003 ) , can not be discounted .",
    "the excitation turnover at the frequencies of the ci j=10 and @xmath27co j=43 lines implies that , with the exception of the ci j=21 line , the gas mass tracing capability of higher frequency lines ( @xmath163 ghz ) is suppressed except in star - forming environments . for essentially the same reasons molecular gas mass estimates based solely on high - j @xmath7co lines observed at high redshifts carry large uncertainties ( factors of @xmath12610 )",
    ". summarizing , while metal - rich gas fueling star - formation is bound to figure prominently in high - j @xmath7co line emission at high redshifts , it will not be the only gas phase present and large amounts of colder , diffuse molecular gas may be lingering e.g. `` in - between '' successive star forming events beyond the current star - forming sites .    here",
    "we must mention that the case for observing the low @xmath4co j=10 , 21 lines remains strong even if the ci lines can deliver more flux per h@xmath5 mass for e.g. cool and diffuse gas reservoirs .",
    "this is because of the current commissioning of large single dish radio telescopes like the green bank telescope ( gbt ) ( tunnable up to 115 ghz ) , and future instruments as the expanded vla ( evla ) , ( continuously tunnable below 45 ghz ) , and a square kilometer array ( ska ) equipped with high frequency receivers ( @xmath164 ghz )",
    ". these will be able to conduct very sensitive observations of the low - j @xmath7co transitions at high redshifts ( carilli & blain 2002 ) , bypass the excitation biases mentioned previously , and sensitively trace molecular gas in the distant universe .",
    "the ci lines have small to moderate optical depths ( @xmath165 ) being , over large scales , as optically thin as @xmath18co ( ojha et el .",
    "2001 ; ikeda et al .",
    "this property along with their simpler 3-level partition function and easy thermalization makes them more straightforward h@xmath5 gas mass tracers than the usually optically thick @xmath4co lines .    for an optically thin line",
    "the emergent brightness is    @xmath166    where @xmath167 is the column density of the upper level , and @xmath168 is the intrinsic line profile .",
    "the received brightness is @xmath169 ( see e.g. ivison et al .",
    "thus in terms of the usually reported observable @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) the ci beam - averaged column density over the telescope beam @xmath172 can be expressed as    @xmath173    where the @xmath174 excitation factor depends on ( @xmath175 , @xmath176 ) , and the radiation field ( see appendix ) . in terms of the gas mass",
    "contained within @xmath172 the last expression becomes    @xmath177    where we used @xmath178 as the corresponding area of the beam at the redshift of the source , @xmath179/[h_2]$ ] , and @xmath180 corrects for the mass in he . in astrophysical units ,    @xmath181^{-1 }",

    "where @xmath186 , an unknown value of @xmath187 introduces an uncertainty of @xmath188 .",
    "a greater source of uncertainty stems from the assumed excitation conditions that determine @xmath189 . for high redshift objects where only one or two lines are usually detected there can be no practical constraints on the gas excitation and the minimal assumption of lte",
    "is usually made in order to deduce @xmath190 . for typical @xmath191 and @xmath192",
    "it is @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "these uncertainties can be larger if there are no available temperature constraints from e.g. measurements of the dust continuum .",
    "predictably @xmath195 has the largest variation , making the ci j=21 transition the more uncertain h@xmath5 mass estimator of the two ci lines .",
    "nevertheless the @xmath7co j=76 line at a similar frequency ( 806 ghz ) is much more sensitive to ambient conditions , and hence an even more uncertain h@xmath5 mass tracer .",
    "similarly the ci j=10 with a smaller @xmath196 variation is tracing h@xmath5 gas more reliably than the @xmath7co j=43 ( 461 ghz ) line even though the latter can be significantly stronger .    in deducing @xmath190 from ci lines we assumed ci distributed throughout a typical molecular cloud but also no significant `` contamination '' from any other gas phase .",
    "this is indeed the case since carbon in hi gas is mostly ionized with e.g. @xmath73/[cii]\\la 3\\times 10^{-3}$ ] in the cnm phase ( wolfire et al .",
    "the small ci line optical depths are an advantage when estimating h@xmath5 mass but they also add @xmath197 to the list of uncertainties .",
    "given the variety of processes affecting [ ci]/[@xmath7co ] and thus @xmath198 , it seems that the latter can vary widely .",
    "however _ the very same processes also affect @xmath199/[h_2]$ ] _ , which is nevertheless found to be relatively constant ( @xmath200 ) over large scales for clouds with @xmath201 ( e.g. van dishoeck 1992 ) .",
    "this is in accordance with the constant @xmath202 found by large scale ci , @xmath4co , @xmath29co j=10 surveys ( e.g. ikeda et al 2002 ) and suggests a dominant physical process that along with turbulent diffusion sets a relatively constant [ c]/[@xmath4co ] throughout a gmc .",
    "however , as was the case for @xmath4co , establishing average @xmath197 values will probably be done observationally , with large surveys conducted over a broad range of conditions and discerning any general trends of [ c]/[@xmath27co ] ( and thus @xmath203 ) in active and/or metal - poor environments .",
    "the potential advantage of the ci lines as h@xmath5 mass tracers can be fully realized only at high redshifts . for @xmath204 the ci j=10 line",
    "is redshifted to @xmath205 ghz where a combination of existing large - aperture instruments ( single dish and interferometers ) and a much improved atmospheric transmission enables sensitive observations . for the j=21 transition",
    "the aforementioned limit is @xmath206 , a typical redshift of the new population of sub - mm bright , starburst galaxies ( chapman et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the commissioning of interferometers in excellent sites , namely sma on mauna kea , hawaii and alma in llano de chajnantor , chile , will allow routine sensitive observations at sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "in such sites the atmospheric transmission even at @xmath207 ghz remains exceptional most of the time ( @xmath208 at zenith , except around the 325 ghz atmospheric absorption feature ) , and the ci lines become accessible to sensitive measurements for @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "particularly interesting is the case when _ both _ ci lines become accessible at lower frequencies , thus allowing an estimate of gas temperatures from their intensity ratio ( assuming lte ) independently of those based on dust continuum or @xmath7co transitions .",
    "currently all high redshift objects detected in @xmath4co are the sites of large scale starbursts and are good targets for ci observations , which hold the promise of uncovering h@xmath5 gas untraced by the high - j @xmath4co transitions .",
    "recently an opportunity to drastically increase their rather small numbers has emerged with the successful spectroscopic redshift determination of several sub - mm bright starbursts at high redshifts ( chapman et al .",
    "such objects are metal - rich and are found to be prominent @xmath7co emitters ( e.g. neri et al .",
    "the recent detection of weak @xmath27co j=32 in a ly - break galaxy at z=2.7 ( baker et al .",
    "2003 ) , with its ci j=21 line redshifted to @xmath211  ghz , offers the possibility of testing the potential of ci lines as h@xmath5 gas tracers in metal - poor and modestly uv - intense objects .    the recent detection of massive gaseous disks at high redshifts ( genzel et al .",
    "2003 ) are currently a highly contentious issue since their presence at such early epochs is hard to reconcile with standard hierarchical models of galaxy evolution .",
    "the much larger spatial distribution of the ci line emission with respect to high - j @xmath4co transitions in typical disks like the milky way , _ holds the promise of yielding a much better picture of disk kinematics and total dynamical mass _ ( by encompassing its flat rotation curve part ) , and thus is an excellent  alternative .",
    "there are currently only two reported detections of ci lines at high redshifts , namely in the cloverleaf quasar ( z=2.56 ) ( barvainis et al .",
    "1997 ; weiss et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the iras galaxy f10214 + 472 ( z=2.28 ) ( brown & vanden bout 1992 ) .",
    "both are strongly lensed systems and particularities of differential lensing may be responsible for their very different ci/@xmath4co flux density ratios .",
    "clearly ci observations of non - lensed high redshift objects are needed .",
    "interestingly in the case of the cloverleaf , and based on the assumption of a concomitant ci emission , weiss et al .",
    "find an h@xmath5 gas mass similar to that deduced from the well - sampled dust continuum or from the multi - transition @xmath4co observations , lending support to the main argument of this work .",
    "finally , the markedly more difficult ci observations in the local universe remain valuable since large scale ci , @xmath7co , and @xmath18co surveys in a variety of environments are needed to establish the range of @xmath197 and `` cross - calibrate '' the two methods of estimating h@xmath5 gas mass .",
    "it is particularly interesting to observe intensely star - forming and/or metal - poor objects in order to search for [ c]/[@xmath7co ] enhancements and its possible metallicity dependence .",

    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "non - equilibrium chemical states , turbulent diffusive mixing , and cosmic rays can easily make ci ubiquitous throughout a typical giant molecular cloud .",
    "this is now firmly supported by large scale ci , @xmath4co , @xmath29co surveys of such clouds in the milky way , which also find a constant average [ c]/[@xmath4co ] abundance ratio over the bulk of their mass .",

    "<S> we examine the fine structure lines @xmath0@xmath1 ( 492  ghz ) and @xmath2@xmath3 ( 809 ghz ) of neutral atomic carbon as bulk molecular gas mass tracers and find that they can be good and on many occasions better than @xmath4co transitions , especially at high redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the notion of ci emission as an h@xmath5 gas mass tracer challenges the long - held view of its distribution over only a relatively narrow layer in the cii / ci / co transition zone in fuv - illuminated molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> past observations have indeed consistently pointed towards a more extended ci distribution but it was only recently , with the advent of large scale imaging of its @xmath6@xmath1 transition , that its surprising ubiquity in molecular clouds has been fully revealed . in the present work we show that under _ typical _ ism conditions such an ubiquity is inevitable because of well known dynamic and non - equilibrium chemistry processes maintaining a significant [ c]/[@xmath7co ] abundance throughout giant molecular clouds during their lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> these processes are more intense in star - forming environments where a larger ambient cosmic ray flux will also play an important role in boosting [ c]/[@xmath4co ] . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting ci lines can be bright and effective h@xmath5 mass tracers especially for diffuse ( @xmath8 ) gas while in uv - intense and/or metal - poor environments their h@xmath5-tracing capability diminishes because of large scale cii production but nevertheless remains superior to that of @xmath4co . </S>",
    "<S> the best place to take full advantage of ci s capacity to trace h@xmath5 is not in the low-@xmath9 universe , where large atmospheric absorption at 492 and 809  ghz precludes routine observations , but at high redshifts ( @xmath10 ) .    </S>",
