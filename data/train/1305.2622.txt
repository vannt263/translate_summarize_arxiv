    "when studying biological populations in nature , it is usual to recognize an unvarying proportion of the genders in a stable environment .",
    "such a prevalent observation has been a remarkable motivation for fundamental contributions in the theory of sex - structured populations .",
    "fisher s comprehension @xcite of the commonness of nearly 1:1 sex ratios , hamilton s explanation @xcite for the existence of biased sex ratios , trivers - willard hypothesis @xcite on the parental capability to adjust the sex ratio of offsprings as a response to environmental changes and charnov mathematical proposal @xcite for sex allocations are some relevant examples of this kind of legacy .    in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we have developed a dynamic - programming model in order to discuss whether the identification of a stable sex ratio in nature might mirror a population maintenance cost under finite resources .",
    "here we propose another dynamical approach to study sex - structured populations which consists in modeling the time evolution of two - sex populations with differential equations . under this point of view",
    ", the interactions of the individuals are represented as a mean tendency of the whole population .",
    "furthermore , instead of looking for a sex ratio that would maximize the efficiency of individuals in the use of available resources , in the population - dynamics formulation , secondary sex ratio is actually one of the parameters of the system . in such a case ,",
    "the aim is thus , for suitable mating functions , to describe and classify the behavior of the population for distinct progeny sex ratios and distinct mortality sex ratios @xcite .",
    "for instance , it has been argued in @xcite that the marriage rate plays an important role in the stability of the population , since polygamy would amplify the sensibility of the system to the variation of the other parameters . in another direction , a model with stable solutions for monogamous and polygamous populations",
    "was presented in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a nonsmooth two - sex logistic model ( which may be seen as an extension of previous formulations ) and we use the qualitative - geometric theory of ordinary differential equations to study it . considering sex - ratio dependent competition terms , we obtain sufficient and necessary conditions for the persistence of the population . in particular , we show that the dynamical behavior of the population is governed by a highly nonlinear relationship between the secondary sex ratio and the competition parameters , and that the average number of male s reproductive partners is an important parameter that may allow a two - sex species to find a stable equilibrium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec.model ] ,",
    "we recall some classical models for two - sex populations and we define the model that will be studied . in section [ sec.singularities ] , we detail its singularities by analyzing two vector fields defined on the plane and naturally associated to the original one . in section [ sec.sex_ratios ] , we study the relationships between secondary and tertiary sex ratios and the competition parameters of the model . in section [ sec.behavior ] , we describe the local and global behavior of the two associated vector fields . in particular ,",
    "we point out conditions on the secondary sex ratio that assure the existence of asymptotically stable singularities and the nonexistence of cycles .",
    "hence , we discuss the local and global dynamics for the original vector field . in section [ sec.final ]",
    ", we outline open questions about the dynamics of the model and some possible extensions .",
    "we consider here a two - sex logistic model which follows the basic lines of the classical logistic model : the population growth is given by the balance between the birth rate ( which depends on the quantity of individuals in the population ) and the death rate ( which depends on square of the quantity of individuals , representing the interactions between them ) .",
    "non - logistic models for two - sex populations have been proposed at least since the 1940 s ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , kendall ( @xcite , page 247 ) proposed two non - logistic models .",
    "the first one consists in a model for the behavior of male and female populations described by the following coupled ode s : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the quantity of females and males at time @xmath3 , respectively , @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the mortality rates of females and males , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are independent parameters for the birth rate of each gender , and @xmath8 is the mating function ( which was supposed to be nonnegative and symmetric in @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) and represents the contribution of males and females to the birth rate . in his work ,",
    "kendall studied the case where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath8 has one of the following forms : @xmath11    the second model proposed by kendall addresses the problem of pair formation in two - sex populations .",
    "in such a model , three coupled ode s take into account the numbers of unmarried males , unmarried females and married couples . once again",
    ", a central role is played by the mating function .    following the kendall s work , goodman @xcite studied the cases where @xmath12 and @xmath13 for several mating functions , including the above ones as well as @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in @xcite , fredrickson assumed two hypotheses on the mating function @xmath8 : _ heterosexuality _ ( that is , @xmath16 ) and _ homogeneity _ ( in the sense that @xmath17 ) . using these hypotheses , he found a general form for differentiable mating functions and deduced that they are _ consistent _ : if there is a preponderance of some gender in the population , then the birth rate will be limited by the number of individuals of the other gender .",
    "other natural hypothesis on @xmath8 is _ monotocity _",
    "@xcite , namely , if @xmath18 and @xmath19 , then @xmath20 .",
    "logistic models for two - sex populations have been considered by the academic community @xcite .",
    "the model in @xcite incorporates nonlinear birth and separation processes to kendall s pair - formation model , while the model studied in @xcite is an age - dependent two - sex model with density dependence in the birth and death . on the other hand , rosen ( @xcite , section 4 )",
    "studied a model which admits in terms for competition : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 describe the effects of intrasexual competition of females and males , respectively , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 characterize the intersexual competition of males on females and females on males , respectively .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite it was considered the mating function given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the average number of female sexual partners that each male has along each reproductive cycle ( @xmath28 may be interpreted as polyandrous population , @xmath29 is understood as a monogamous population , and @xmath30 may be seen as a polygynous population ) .",
    "we recall that models like   and   do not inspect in an explicit way certain internal mechanisms of the populations , like pair formation or age structure .",
    "in fact , such mechanisms are captured by the parameters of the models .",
    "consider , for example , a population of a total of @xmath31 males and @xmath32 females of which @xmath33 males are sexually active and @xmath34 females are receptive and each one of them has fertility rate @xmath35 .",
    "suppose yet that each sexually active male successfully breeds with @xmath36 females .",
    "in such a case , these models will interpret that all the males successfully breeds with @xmath37 females and all the females are receptive ( each one of them with fertility rate @xmath38 ) , so the net number of individuals being born and the magnitude of competitions will be virtually the same and the models will reveal the behavior of the population growth .",
    "notice that competitions for mating are not focused by these models , since they are part of the pair formation mechanism and in general they do not affect the mortality rate . besides , since the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 absorb the age structure and pair formation , the sex - ratio type considered in the models is the tertiary sex ratio ( the number of adult males divided by the number of adult females  also named adult sex ratio ) , which , when adopting such a point of view , is indistinguishable from the operational sex ratio ( the number of sexually active males divided by the number of receptive females ) .    note that competition terms of the form @xmath41 in the above equations may not capture some aspects of the relationship between the genders .",
    "in fact , although for predator - prey models it is reasonable to suppose that a great number of predators or preys will increase the probability of interactions between the species and then the population growth of both species will be affected by the quantity @xmath41 , this interpretation does not necessarily hold for two - sex populations , in which one of the genders is not a vital resource but in general both genders coexist and have common resources . the causes and consequences of adult sex ratio and operational sex ratio have been extensively investigated by biologists .",
    "there are pieces of evidence that the sex ratio has impact on fitness prospects of males and females and on optimal sex allocation decisions @xcite .",
    "it was noticed that a male - biased sex ratio could amplify male - male competition with negative impact on female survival and fecundity ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the excess of males against females has also been pointed out as a likely negative factor for females in the human case @xcite . in other words ,",
    "when @xmath2 is much greater than @xmath1 , even if @xmath41 is small , one may detect a negative impact on the @xmath42 population .",
    "these observations lead us to incorporate to equations a mortality term for each gender which takes into account the ratio between the genders on the intersexual competitions .",
    "in other words , the female population will have a mortality term proportional to @xmath43 , while the male population will have a mortality term proportional to @xmath44 ( these terms can be seen as ` outer - gender competition terms ' ) .",
    "let us denote    @xmath45 : :    the characteristic function of the set    @xmath46 ; : :    the average birth rate of population ; : :    the average percentage of female births per pregnancy ( thus    @xmath47 indicates the average percentage of male births ,    while @xmath48 is the secondary sex ratio of the    population ) ; : :    the mortality rate for females and males , respectively ; @xmath49 : :    indicating how the growth of the female population is negatively    affected by its own size and by the size of the male population ,    respectively . we suppose that    @xmath50 , since otherwise    there would not be a coercive force to limit the population growth of    the females and either both genders would have an unlimited growth or    the female population would increase until the male population would    become extinct ; @xmath51 : :    describing how the growth of the male population is negatively    affected by the size of the female population and by its own size ,    respectively . as before , at least one of these parameters will be    strictly positive ; @xmath52 : :    indicating how the growth of the female population is negatively    affected by the interaction with the male population , and how the    growth of the male population is negatively affected by the    interaction with the female population , respectively .",
    "we present then the model @xmath53 where @xmath8 is the mating function given by .",
    "note that the terms @xmath54 and @xmath55 above are multiplied by @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , since the effect of a gender on the other one will only be considered in its presence .    in the next sections",
    ", we will study the behavior of the system for the situation where there is no intersexual competition and the mortality rate of each gender is negligible with respect to the density - dependent mortality .",
    "from now on , we will consider @xmath58 . furthermore ,",
    "due to our qualitative and geometric approach , without loss of generality , we may assume @xmath59 in our analysis .",
    "using , let then @xmath60 be the vector field given by @xmath61    note that , defining the maps @xmath62 and @xmath63 by @xmath64 and the regions @xmath65 we have that , except on the axes , @xmath66 can be written as @xmath67    therefore , a strategy to understand the flow generated by the vector field @xmath66 consists in studying the flows generated by the vector fields @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and the way as they are coupled along the ray @xmath70 , @xmath71 .      in the sequence , we will study the singularities of the vector fields @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the existence of singularities for the vector fields and the type of these singularities obviously depend on the choice of parameters .",
    "we denote @xmath72    using the above notation , we have the following result .",
    "[ vfi_theo ] the vector fields @xmath73 and @xmath74 admit finitely many singularities with non - null coordinates if , and only if , @xmath75 and @xmath76 moreover , under the above conditions , @xmath73 has the singularities @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , where @xmath80 while @xmath74 has the singularities @xmath77 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where @xmath83    we will only prove the result for the vector field @xmath68 , since the proof for @xmath69 is completely analogous .",
    "let us show that and are sufficient conditions to have finitely many singularities with non - zero coordinates and that the singularities are given accordingly to .",
    "so let @xmath78 be a non - null solution of @xmath84    for a moment , suppose that @xmath85 and @xmath86 are both non - null .",
    "by solving the first equation for @xmath87 and then using it in the second equation , we get that @xmath88 satisfies @xmath89 since @xmath90 and @xmath91 , we obtain that @xmath92 .    thus ,",
    "replacing the value of @xmath88 in the expression obtained for @xmath87 , we find out that the nonnegative second coordinate will be @xmath93    now , observe that if @xmath94 or @xmath95 , then the above solution obtained for @xmath96 can be also achieved by equaling the corresponding parameter(s ) to zero in .",
    "thus , we have proved that and are sufficient conditions to have finitely many non - null singularities .    to see that and are also necessary conditions ,",
    "the reader may check without difficulty that , if @xmath97 but @xmath98 or @xmath99 , then the unique singular point for @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the origin .",
    "finally , notice that , if @xmath100 , then @xmath101 and the singularities of @xmath68 are all the points belonging to the conic defined by @xmath102 , while the singularities of @xmath69 are all the points belonging to the conic defined by @xmath103 .    for the degenerate case @xmath104 ,",
    "it is easy to see that each singularity is nonhyperbolic ; however , since this is a non - generic situation , we will not treat it in this work .",
    "we regroup in this section several results on dynamical properties related to sex ratios which will be useful in the local and global analysis of the proposed nonsmooth system .",
    "the secondary sex ratio of the population is the quantity @xmath105 .",

    "then , the tertiary sex ratio of the population is the quantity @xmath108 .",
    "when @xmath109 is the unique equilibrium point we will denote the tertiary sex ratio simply by @xmath110 .    under the convention that a division of a positive number by zero is @xmath111 , we can assure a singularity in the first quadrant for each vector field by using the conditions below , which compare the ratios of competition factors to the secondary sex ratio .",

    "thus , @xmath68 is pointing to the interior of @xmath261 along all the line segment from the origin to the point @xmath78 .",
    "now , observe that , on the segment of the ellipse from the origin to the point @xmath78 , the vector field @xmath68 is pointing to the straight line @xmath262 ( see figure  [ nocyclesfig1 ] ) .",

    "the flows associated to the vector fields @xmath68 and @xmath69 are `` glued '' along the ray @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "first , note that the position of the singular point of @xmath68 does not depend on the parameter @xmath27 . on the other hand , if all parameters remain constant but @xmath27 , as @xmath27 increases , the coordinates of the singular point of @xmath69 also increase .",
    "therefore , from , this means that , varying @xmath27 , the ray @xmath273 , @xmath274 , which is the frontier between @xmath123 and @xmath124 , changes its position , while @xmath81 moves along the straight line @xmath257 .",
    "in particular , note that : if @xmath275 , then the ray @xmath257 , @xmath274 , is inside of @xmath123 and the non - null singularity of @xmath66 is @xmath78 ; if @xmath276 , then the ray @xmath257 , @xmath274 , coincides with the frontier between @xmath123 and @xmath124 , and @xmath277 is a singularity of @xmath66 ; and if @xmath278 , then the ray @xmath257 , @xmath274 , is inside of @xmath124 and the non - trivial singularity of @xmath66 is @xmath81 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the average number of the male s reproductive partners @xmath27 plays a key role in the selection between @xmath78 and @xmath81 as singularity of the vector field @xmath66 . due to corollary  [ cor.nocycles ] , under condition , it is always possible to use @xmath27 to select a stable node as the singularity of @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , if both @xmath78 and @xmath81 are stable for their respective vector fields , then the singularity of @xmath66 will be stable regardless of the value of @xmath27 . however , if @xmath279 , then the non - null singularity of @xmath66 is @xmath81 , which satisfies @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "thus , the maximum size of an equilibrium population is achieved when @xmath282 .    under condition  , when the secondary sex ratio @xmath147 is near @xmath283 , @xmath78 is a stable node while @xmath81 is an unstable singularity . in such a situation ,",
    "the singularity of @xmath66 will be stable if , and only if , @xmath284 , that is , when the average number of female sexual partners of each male is larger than the female : male ratio , which means that , on average , all the females are reproducing .",
    "on the other hand , if the secondary sex ratio @xmath147 is near @xmath285 , then @xmath78 is an unstable singularity , while @xmath81 is a stable node . in this case",
    ", the singularity of @xmath66 will be stable if , and only if , @xmath286 , which means that , on average , all the males are reproducing but not all the females are reproducing .",
    "we notice that the above analysis enlighten an interesting feature of the population s equilibrium .",
    "suppose , for an easier comprehension , that @xmath287 .",
    "therefore , if there are much less males than females being born , then the conservation of the two - sex species depends , in a fundamental way , on the fact that all the females are reproducing successfully . on the other hand ,",
    "if there are much less females than males being born , then the population will only remain stable and achieve its equilibrium point when a number of females are not reproducing .",
    "this apparently contradictory interpretation indicates that the average number of male s reproductive partners @xmath27 may artificially increase the effect of the competition ( with respect to its impact on the population growth ) of the female population when this gender has relatively few individuals , allowing the population to reach a stable equilibrium .",
    "the next result presents sufficient conditions for nonexistence of cycles for the flow associated to @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , theorem  [ nocycles ] provides us conditions for which the vector fields @xmath68 and @xmath69 do not admit cycles , but @xmath66 may have a cycle composed by parts of orbits which are not cycles for those vector fields ( see figure  [ cyclesphi](b ) )",
    ".    the vector field @xmath66 does not admit cycles if one of the following conditions holds :    i.i@xmath68 does not admit cycles on the first quadrant and @xmath288 ;    ii.@xmath69 does not admit cycles on the first quadrant and @xmath289 .    supposing @xmath288 , since @xmath290 , the non - null singularity of @xmath66 is @xmath78 .",
    "if @xmath68 does not admit cycles , then there are no cycles for flow associated to @xmath66 within the region @xmath123 . due to poincar - bendixon theorem",
    "for non - differentiable vector fields ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , inside the region enclosed by a periodic orbit there must be at least one singularity .",
    "since @xmath66 is null outside the first quadrant , the unique possibility is that a cycle for @xmath66 must pass from @xmath123 to @xmath124 and then return to @xmath123 going around @xmath78 . if @xmath291 , from corollary  [ alphasigmatau ] and remark  [ obschangeoforientation ] , the ray @xmath257 , @xmath292 , is a stable manifold of @xmath78 , and hence @xmath66 does not admit cycles .",
    "thus , suppose that @xmath293 .",
    "notice that the existence of a cycle implies that @xmath66 changes its orientation with respect to the regions @xmath123 and @xmath124 on the ray @xmath273 , @xmath294 . from lemma  [ changeoforientation",
    "] , this can only happen at the origin and at the point @xmath295 such that @xmath296 .",
    "let then @xmath297 and @xmath298 denote , respectively , the points where the straight line @xmath273 intercepts the ellipse   and the ellipse  . since @xmath288 , we prove _ i. _ by analyzing the following cases :    @xmath299 : : :    this means that @xmath300 coincides with the origin , and thus    @xmath66 does not change its orientation with respect to the    regions @xmath123 and @xmath124 along the ray    @xmath273 , @xmath292 , which prevents    @xmath301 to have a cycle .",
    "@xmath302 : : :    from proposition [ vetcorfieldatorigin ] , when @xmath303    approaches the origin along the straight line @xmath273 ,    the vector @xmath304 tends to have the orientation of    @xmath305 , and thus it is pointing to inside of    region @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , since at the points    @xmath297 and @xmath298 the vector field    @xmath66 is also pointing to inside of @xmath123 ,    this shows that @xmath66 points to inside of    @xmath123 along all the line segment from the origin to    @xmath298 .",
    "otherwise , the vector field would change at least    twice its orientation with respect to the regions @xmath123    and @xmath124 , but it can only change at point    @xmath300 ( see figure  [ cyclesphi](a ) ) . such a configuration    clearly prevents the existence of a cycle for @xmath301 .",
    "+    the proof of _ ii . _ is analogous .",
    "we have considered a two - sex logistic model given by a vector field that is non - differentiable on a straight line parameterized by the average number of female sexual partners of each male , and in which the growth of each gender is negatively affected by inter- , intra- and outer - gender competitions . adopting a generic point of view",
    ", we have shown that , in the case without inter - gender competition and with mortality rates negligible with respect to the density - dependent mortalities , the population is persistent only if the secondary sex - ratio and competition parameters satisfy specific inequalities ( condition ) , which reflect in particular that the effects of male - male competitions will have relatively greater impact on the male population than on the female population , while the effects of female - female competitions will have relatively greater impact on the female population than on the male population .",
    "furthermore , we have argued that the average number of male s reproductive partners could be seen as an adjustable parameter which may allow a two - sex species to find a stable equilibrium for a large set of secondary sex ratios and competition parameters .",
    "a question that remains open is whether there exist parameters for which the flow of the vector field @xmath66 has cycles . besides",
    ", it also remains open to analyze the behavior of the model with all the parameters being non - null , which should reveal a richer dynamics .",
