    "it is commonly applied in applied mathematics , physics , chemistry and astronomy as it describes the line profile behavior that occurs due to simultaneous lorentz and doppler broadening effects ; the lorentz broadening is observed as a result of the heisenberg uncertainty principle and chaotic multiple collisions of the particles while the doppler broadening appears due to velocity distribution of the particles .",
    "the voigt function can describe the spectral properties in the photon emission or absorption of atmospheric gases @xcite and celestial bodies @xcite .",
    "it is also widely used in crystallography @xcite and can be utilized in many other spectroscopic applications , for example , to characterize the photo - luminescent properties of nanomaterials @xcite or to determine the hyper structure of an isotope @xcite and so on .",

    "for example , in a line - by - line radiative transfer simulation to resolve some problems associated with inhomogeneity , the earths or other planetary atmosphere can be divided up to @xmath14 layers @xcite .",
    "taking into account that computation requires a nested loop procedure in order to adjust properly for the fitting parameters for each atmospheric layer that may contain many different molecular species , the total number of the computed points may exceed hundreds of millions . since in a radiative transfer model",
    "the computation of spectral broadening profiles requires considerable amount of time , a rapid approximation of the voigt function is very desirable @xcite .",
    "consequently , the rapid and accurate computation of the voigt / complex error function still remains topical ( see for example an optimized algorithm in the recent work @xcite ) .    in this work we present a new rational approximation of the voigt function for efficient computation . due to absence of the poles at @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath5 this rational approximation enables stability in algorithmic implementation .",

    "this confirms a rapid convergence of the exponential function approximation that makes it suitable for numerical integration .",

    "the integrand in this integral is analytic everywhere over the entire complex plain except @xmath53 isolated points @xmath54 where singularities are observed .",
    "however , as we take a contour integral only on the upper complex plane , for example as a semicircle @xmath55 with infinite radius in counterclockwise ( ccw ) direction , the quantity of isolated points is reduced twice and becomes equal to @xmath56 .",
    "lastly , substituting the corresponding isolated points inside the domain enclosed by contour @xmath55 : @xmath57 into the residue theorems formula that for our specific case is expressed in form @xmath58},\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the integrand of integral , we find a new series approximation of the voigt function @xmath60 + i{b_m}\\left ( { y + \\varsigma /2 } \\right)\\left [ { c_m^2 + { x^2 } + { { \\left ( { y + \\varsigma /2 } \\right)}^2 } } \\right]}}{{\\left [ { { c_m } + x - i\\left ( { y + \\varsigma /2 } \\right ) } \\right]\\left [ { { c_m } - x + i\\left ( { y + \\varsigma /2 } \\right ) } \\right]\\left [ { c_m^2 - { { \\left ( { x + i\\left ( { y + \\varsigma /2 } \\right ) } \\right)}^2 } } \\right]}}}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since an algorithm involving complex numbers takes extra time , it would be very desirable to exclude them in computation . thus , after some trivial rearrangements of the equation above , it can be represented in a simplified form as the series approximation consisting of the real variables and constants only @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 and @xmath64 as the constants @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are independent of the input parameters @xmath18 and @xmath68 , the obtained series is a rational approximation .",
    "since the voigt function is an even with respect to the parameter @xmath18 and odd with respect to the parameter @xmath68 : @xmath69 it is sufficient to consider the values @xmath18 and @xmath68 only from the @xmath70 and @xmath71 quadrants in order to cover the entire complex plane .",
    "consequently , in algorithmic implementation it is reasonable to take the second input parameter by modulus as @xmath72 and compute the voigt function according to the scheme @xmath73 thus , if the parameter @xmath68 is negative , we first take it by absolute value and , after computation , simply change the sign of the computed result to opposite .",
    "it should also be noted that taking the argument @xmath72 is advantageous in implementation as it prevents computational overflow and enables an algorithmic stability ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "the series approximation alone covers the domain @xmath2 and @xmath3 , required in applications using the hitran molecular spectroscopic database @xcite . in general , it provides accurate results while @xmath74 .",
    "however , this approximation may be used only to cover a smaller domain @xmath75 and @xmath76 that is considered most difficult for rapid and accurate computation .    in our recent publication",
    "we have shown that the following approximation ( see equation in @xcite ) can be effective for computation in the narrow domain @xmath75 and @xmath77 along @xmath18-axis : @xmath78 \\\\     & \\approx \\operatorname{re } \\left\\ { { { e^{{{\\left ( { ix - y } \\right)}^2}}}\\left [ { 1 + \\frac{{i{e^{{x^2}}}}}{{\\sqrt \\pi   } } \\left ( { 2f\\left ( x \\right ) - \\frac{{1 - { e^{2ixy}}}}{x } } \\right ) } \\right ] } \\right\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or @xmath79,\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the dawsons integral . as argument @xmath18 in the dawsons integral",
    "is real , its implementation is not problematic and several efficient approximations can be found in literature @xcite .    when the input parameters @xmath18 and @xmath68 are large enough ( say when the condition @xmath81 is satisfied ) , many rational approximations become effective for accurate and rapid computation . for example , the gauss  hermit quadrature or the taylor expansion can be effectively implemented ( see for example @xcite for details ) .",
    "a matlab source code for computation of the voigt / complex error function that covers the entire complex plane can be accessed through matlab central , file i d : # 47801 @xcite .",
    "this code has been developed by our research group and can be used for verification of the computed results .",
    "the domain divisions for computation of the voigt function with complete coverage of the complex plane can be developed similarly .    in order to demonstrate the computational efficiency of the series approximation ( 12 ) ,",
    "the comparison with the weidemans rational approximation has been made ( see equation ( 38-i ) and corresponding matlab code in @xcite ) .",
    "such a choice is justified since the weidemans approximation is one of the most rapid for computation of the voigt / complex error function .",
    "the computational testing we performed by using a typical desktop computer shows that with same number of the summation terms @xmath50 ( default integer in matlab code in @xcite is also @xmath0 ) , the algorithm based on series approximation is faster in computation than that of based in the weidemans rational approximation by factors about @xmath82 and @xmath83 for input arrays @xmath18 and @xmath68 consisting of @xmath84 and @xmath85 million elements , respectively ( see the matlab source code with implementation of the series approximation in appendix b ) .",
    "this is mainly because the weidemans rational approximation computes simultaneously both the real @xmath86 and imaginary @xmath87 parts , while the rational approximation computes only the real part @xmath86 of the complex error function @xmath88 .",
    "it should be noted that in most practical applications the imaginary part @xmath87 of the complex error function is not needed and simply ignored .",
    "moreover , due to rapid convergence of the series approximation we may decrease the number of the summation terms .",
    "in particular , at @xmath89 the computational acceleration of the voigt function can be further gained by about @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the application of the series approximation may be advantageous especially for intense computations with extended input arrays .",
    "in order to quantify accuracy of the series approximation ( 12 ) , it is convenient to define the relative error as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the reference .",
    "the highly accurate reference values can be generated , for example , by using the algorithm 680 @xcite or recently published algorithm 916 @xcite .",
    "figures 2a and 2b show the logarithm @xmath93 of the relative error of the series approximation at @xmath94 .",
    "the domain required for coverage of the hitran molecular spectroscopic database is @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite while the domain @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the most difficult for accurate and rapid computation of the voigt function .",
    "therefore , we will consider the accuracy behavior within the hitran subdomain and narrow band domain @xmath95 and @xmath96 separately as shown in figs .",
    "2a and 2b , respectively .    as we can see from fig . 2a , within the hitran subdomain the accuracy of the series approximation is quite uniform and better than @xmath1 over most of this area .",
    "although the accuracy deteriorates with decreasing @xmath68 , it , nevertheless , remains high and better than @xmath97 .",
    "another advantage is that the area where the accuracy deteriorates is relatively small .",
    "particularly , the area where accuracy is worse than @xmath98 ( yellow and red colors ) is smaller than 2% of the domains total area .        with randomly taken input parameters @xmath18 and @xmath68 ,",
    "it is determined that the average accuracy over the domain of practical interest @xmath2 and @xmath3 is @xmath1 .",
    "although the series approximation can cover this domain accurately , it may be implemented only within domain @xmath75 and @xmath76 that is the most difficult for accurate and rapid computation .    in the narrow band shown in the fig .",
    "2b , the accuracy deteriorates further with decreasing @xmath68 .",
    "however , it still remains high and better than @xmath99 .",
    "in particular , the best and worst accuracies in the narrow band domain @xmath96 exceed @xmath100 ( yellow color ) and @xmath99 ( dark red color ) , respectively .    in modern applications requiring the hitran molecular spectroscopic data - base , the accuracy of the voigt function should be @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , we may reduce the integer @xmath40 in the series approximation from @xmath0 to @xmath102 in order to gain computational acceleration .",
    "the number of the summation terms , determined by the integer @xmath40 , is quite sensitive to the small parameter value @xmath103 .",
    "we have found empirically that at @xmath89 the best accuracy can be achieved by taking @xmath104 .",
    "figure 3a depicts the logarithm @xmath93 of the relative error of the series approximation at @xmath105 in the hitran subdomain @xmath75 and @xmath106 .",
    "one can see that in the hitran subdomain the accuracy is better than @xmath99 .",
    "figure 3b illustrates the logarithm @xmath93 of the relative error of the series approximation at @xmath105 in the narrow band domain @xmath75 and @xmath107 . despite only @xmath102 summation terms involved in the series approximation ( 12 ) ,",
    "the accuracy within this domain is better than @xmath101 . for comparison , to achieve the same accuracy @xmath101 at @xmath108 , the weidemans approximation requires @xmath109 summation terms ( see fig . 4 in @xcite for details ) .",
    "thus , we can see that the series approximation may be useful and convenient in spectroscopic applications .",
    "a rational approximation for rapid and accurate computation of the voigt function is presented . with only @xmath0 summation terms ,",
    "the proposed rational approximation provides average accuracy @xmath1 in the domain of practical interest @xmath2 and @xmath3 that is needed for applications using the hitran molecular spectroscopic database . the computational test shows that the algorithm based on series approximation is more rapid in computation than that of based on the weidemans rational approximation by factor greater than @xmath110 .",
    "algorithmic stability is achieved since the proposed series approximation contains no poles at @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
