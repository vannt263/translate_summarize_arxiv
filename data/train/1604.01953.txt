    "for instance , the truncated bloch waves @xcite consisting of several in - phase peaks placed in a row can be viewed as complexes of single - hump fgss . for classification of the gap solitons in the second spectral gap ,",
    "an alphabet of five symbols is necessary , and so on .",
    "an important property of a gap soliton is its stability , since only dynamically stable modes are likely to be experimentally feasible .",

    "the most relevant for our study outcomes for the case of repulsive interactions ( @xmath6 ) can be summarized as follows .",

    "the stability relies on the linear ( or spectral ) stability technique which reduces the stability question to a study of the spectrum of a certain linear operator .",
    "depending on the character of unstable eigenvalues , the instability typically manifests itself either as a purely _ exponential instability _",
    "( when the unstable eigenvalues have zero imaginary parts ) or as an _ oscillatory instability _ ( oi ) ( when the unstable eigenvalues are complex with nonzero imaginary parts ) .",
    "while the instabilities of the former type are relatively simple to detect @xcite , the accurate tracing of ois is much more challenging @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the information about ois of gap solitons in optical lattices is rather scarce .",
    "the absence of information on ois for the simplest one - hump gap solitons in gpe is especially remarkable in view of well - known ois of bragg gap solitons in nonlinear dirac equations @xcite .",
    "the latter system can be deduced from the gpe with a shallow periodic potential using an asymptotic multiple - scale expansion @xcite , and therefore the results about ois of the solitons for dirac system seem to be not consistent with the stability results for the single - hump fgs mentioned above .    the numerical difficulties arising in the analysis of the ois of the gap solitons are related to several issues .",
    "first , the rates of ois are typically quite small @xcite .",
    "another difficulty results from poor localization of the gap soliton and ( or ) of the eigenfunction associated with an unstable eigenvalue .",
    "this situation typically takes place when the chemical potential @xmath9 is close to the gap edge .",
    "it requires unpractically wide computational windows or a particularly accurate treatment of the boundary conditions .",
    "some of these difficulties can be overcome using the evans function approach which was employed in @xcite to trace ois of gap solitons in the attractive condensates .",
    "it was further demonstrated in @xcite that the numerically accurate evaluation of the evans function requires a careful treatment of the stiffness issue which arises for some values of the complex argument of the evans function .",
    "the stiffness problem can be fixed if one redefined the evans function using the exterior algebra formalism @xcite .",
    "this idea has been developed into a robust numerical technique which was demonstrated to provide reliable results even for relatively weak instabilities of gap solitons @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use the evans function approach combined with the exterior algebra formulation in order to reveal and describe weak ois of fgs and higher - order gap solitons in the repulsive bec .",
    "we focus on the first and second spectral gaps . in each gap",
    ", we consider the single - hump fgs and two higher - order solitons bearing two or three in - phase humps .",
    "the main outcomes of our numerical study can be outlined as follows .",
    "* in the first gap , all the considered solitons ( including the single - hump fgs ) are stable far from the upper band edge , but undergo ois in the region near the upper band edge .",
    "the width of this instability region is quite significant : it occupies about 15%-20% of the width of the first gap . * in the second gap , all the considered solitons ( including the fgss ) are , in general , unstable due to ois .",
    "however , in a sufficiently deep potential , there exist intervals of @xmath9 where fgs are stable .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our results constitute the first explicit demonstration and detailed description of ois for fgss in the case of repulsive interactions @xmath6 in the first and in the second gap .",
    "on the other hand , our results advance the current understanding of the higher - order modes @xcite , since we show that they undergo ois even in a deep potential .    in order to confirm the linear stability results , we have also performed a series of direct simulations of temporal behaviour of the solitons in the gpe ( [ eq : gpe ] ) .",
    "the results of these studies agree with the conclusions obtained from the linear stability analysis and display the slow decay of unstable gap solitons and the persistent evolution of the stable ones .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : families ] we briefly describe the families of gap solitons whose stability is the main subject of the present study . in sec .",
    "[ sec : stability ] we present our main results on linear and nonlinear stability of the gap solitons .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "in our study , we use a prototypical example of the periodic potential in the form @xmath15 where real @xmath16 characterizes the depth of the lattice .",
    "the spectrum of the linear eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : linear ] ) with the potential ( [ eq : potential ] ) consists of one semi - infinite gap and a countable set of finite gaps @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bandgaps ] ) . in our study",
    ", we consider the gap solitons in the first and in the second gaps ( no gap solitons exist in the semi - infinite gap in repulsive becs ) . in each of the gaps , we consider three families of nonlinear modes : the fundamental gap soliton with the single dominating peak at @xmath17 ( the single - hump fgs ) , and two higher - order solitons , with two and three dominating peaks . in the terminology of @xcite ,",
    "these higher - order solitons correspond to the truncated bloch waves , and in terms of the coding approach @xcite they are the bound states of two or three in - phase single - hump fgss with codes @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "representative spatial profiles of the considered solutions for two different values of the chemical potential @xmath9 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : solutions ] .",
    "changing value of @xmath9 inside the gap , it is possible to construct numerically continuous families of gap solitons @xcite .",
    "these families can be visualized in the plane @xmath20 vs. @xmath9 , where the squared @xmath21-norm @xmath22 has the physical meaning of the number of particles in the condensate .",
    "the dependencies @xmath20 vs. @xmath9 for @xmath23 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma](a ) . in the first gap ,",
    "one of the families ( corresponding to the single - hump fgs ) bifurcates from the edge of the spectral band .",
    "the two other curves do not bifurcate from the band edge , .",
    "all the three curves can be continued to the upper edge of the first gap .",
    "the shapes of the solitons in the second gap are similar to their counterparts in the first gap , see fig .",

    "after substitution of ( [ eq : perturb ] ) into the gpe ( [ eq : gpe ] ) and neglecting higher - order in @xmath25 and @xmath26 terms , one arrives at the following linear eigenvalue problem @xmath28 where linear operators @xmath29 are defined as @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "if the spectrum of @xmath32 is purely imaginary , then the amplitudes of perturbations @xmath33 and @xmath34 do not grow , and the soliton is said to be linearly stable . on the other hand ,",
    "if at least one eigenvalue @xmath35 has nonzero real part , then the soliton is unstable .",
    "the largest real part of the eigenvalues characterizes the instability growth rate .",
    "it is also easy to see that if @xmath35 belongs to the spectrum of the operator @xmath32 , then @xmath36 and @xmath37 also belong to the spectrum .",
    "thus there are two typical scenarios of instability : ( i ) the instability may take place due to the presence of a pair of real eigenvalues @xmath35 and @xmath36 and ( ii ) it may be caused by a _ quartet _ of unstable eigenvalues @xmath38 , where real and imaginary parts of @xmath35 are nonzero .",
    "the instabilities of the type ( ii ) are known as _ oscillatory instabilities _ @xcite .",
    "in spite of recent advances in the rigorous theory for analysis of the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : linstab ] ) @xcite , in the general case the description of its spectrum can be pursued only numerically . numerical solution of the linear stability problem ( [ eq : linstab ] ) is recognized to be a sufficiently challenging problem @xcite .",
    "one of well - elaborated numerical approaches to this task is based on the the evans function @xcite which is especially useful if the eigenfunctions associated with unstable eigenvalues of ( [ eq : linstab ] ) are poorly localized .",
    "the evans function @xmath39 is an analytic function defined in the complex domain except the points of the essential spectrum of the linear stability operator @xmath32 .",
    "the set of zeros of the evans function coincides with the set of the isolated eigenvalues of the linear stability operator .",
    "moreover , the order of the zero of the evans function is equal to the algebraic multiplicity of the corresponding isolated eigenvalue .    according to the standard definition @xcite ,",
    "the evans function is a @xmath35-dependent determinant whose columns are the vectors of stable and unstable manifolds for the linear stability problem ( [ eq : linstab ] ) . in this case",
    "the problem ( [ eq : linstab ] ) is treated as a system of odes depending on the complex parameter @xmath35 , and these vectors should be computed solving the cauchy problem for ( [ eq : linstab ] ) .",
    "however , it was demonstrated @xcite that for certain values of the complex argument @xmath35 the system ( [ eq : linstab ] ) is stiff and the direct evaluation of the evans function can not be fulfilled with the sufficient accuracy .",
    "the stiffness issue can be overcome by redefinition of the evans function using the exterior algebra formalism @xcite . redefined in this way , the evans function was used to study the stability of the surface gap solitons @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "we use the exterior algebra formulation of the evans function to describe oscillatory instabilities of the fundamental and higher order gap solitons in the repulsive bec .",
    "while the detailed explanation of the numerical approach can be found in @xcite , for the sake of self - containment of our work we describe briefly the main ingredients of the method in the appendix  a. appendix  b addresses technical details of implementation of the method . additionally , in appendix  b we briefly compare the stability results obtained with the evans function approach and with the fourier collocation method which is another well - elaborated tool for computing the instabilities of gap solitons @xcite .",
    "as follows from our results , the accuracy of the fourier collocation method may be not sufficient to compute weak ois .",
    "this confirms that the intricate evans function technique is essential for the accurate tracing of ois of the fgss .",
    "using the evans function approach , we have examined in details stability of fundamental ( single - hump ) and multi - hump solitons in the first and the second spectral gaps of a lattice ( [ eq : potential ] ) with the fixed depth @xmath23 .",
    "the results of this study are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] .",
    "then , in order to check that the obtained results are generic and to understand the effect of the depth of the lattice on the found instabilities , we have repeated the computations in a more shallow ( @xmath40 ) and a deeper ( @xmath41 ) lattices , see fig .  [ fig : gamma2 ] and fig .",

    "[ fig : gamma](e ) , we have not found any unstable eigenvalue of fgs for @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , we conjecture that the fgss are stable for the corresponding values of the chemical potential . however , for larger @xmath9",
    ", we have identified three quartets of unstable eigenvalues .",
    "imaginary parts of the unstable eigenvalues are typically nonzero , which confirms to the oscillatory character of the instabilities [ see fig .  [",

    "the first quartet of unstable eigenvalues exists only in a relatively narrow window @xmath43 [ fig .",

    "[ fig : gamma](f , g ) ] , we observe that the stability picture is remarkably similar to that for the fgss : no unstable eigenvalues is observed for sufficiently small @xmath9 , but for large values of the chemical potential the solutions are unstable due to three quartets of unstable eigenvalues which cause two windows of instability . for the family of two - hump solitons ,",
    "the onset of instability is detected at @xmath50 .",
    "the instability persists in the narrow interval @xmath51 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : gamma](c ) ] . , but the instability again takes place for all @xmath9 between @xmath52 and the upper gap edge . in a similar way , the three - hump solitons have two windows of instability : the narrow window is situated at @xmath53 [ fig .",

    "the typical instability rates of the multi - hump solitons are comparable with those for the fundamental solitons and do not exceed @xmath47 .",

    "[ fig : gamma ] and [ fig : gamma2 ] have been obtained with typical values @xmath116 , @xmath117 [ for computation of solitons and the evans function in the first spectral gap ] and @xmath118 [ for computation of solitons and the evans function in the second gap .",
    "we have also selectively tested several particular unstable solitons by repeating the computation with smaller step @xmath110 and confirmed that the found instabilities are reproduced .",
    "finally , we notice that the detection of ois is indeed a complex problem , and an advanced numerical tool is necessary for its solution . to this end , let us compare the results of our analysis with the results obtained with the fourier collocation method ( fcm ) @xcite which is another common tool for study of spectral stability of gap solitons .",
    "the fcm is known to provide excellent results for detection of relatively strong and exponentials instabilities , but as follows from our numerical experiments it may not be sufficiently robust to trace weak ois . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us consider fgss in the first gap with @xmath23 fixing the parameters of the numerical method as @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "we consider three close values of the chemical potential @xmath9 , namely , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "using the fcm ( implemented with @xmath123 spectral harmonics using the computer codes from @xcite ) we have detected a pair of ois ( @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) at @xmath126 .",
    "however , the fcm does not indicate any instability for @xmath127 and @xmath122 .",
    "moreover , if we try to check the obtained results by repeating the computation in a smaller ( @xmath128 ) or in a larger ( @xmath118 ) computational window , the fcm does not find any unstable eigenvalue at all ( for each of the three considered values of @xmath9 ) . in a similar way ,",
    "the results of the fcm are sensitive to the choice of the spatial step @xmath110 .",
    "hence , in this particular situation the results of the fcm can not be considered as reliable .    on the other hand , the evans function indicates a pair of ois for each of the chosen values of @xmath9 .",
    "namely , for @xmath127 the evans function finds unstable eigenvalues @xmath129 , @xmath130 , for @xmath126 it gives @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and at @xmath122 it gives @xmath133 , @xmath134 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma](e ) ] .",
    "moreover , these instabilities are reproduced with good accuracy if one repeats the numerical procedure with different @xmath32 and @xmath110 .",
    "thus the evans function robustly traces the instability ."
