    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have been the tool that made possible the discovery of the acceleration of the expansion of the universe ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) , and they are now providing new insights on the cosmic component , dubbed `` dark energy '' , thus revealed .",
    "however , in contrast with their key role as cosmological probes , and after more than 50 years of supernova research , the nature of their progenitors remains elusive . as far back as 1960 , it was established that type i supernovae ( in fact , the now denominated sne ia , or thermonuclear supernovae ) should result from the ignition of degenerate nuclear fuel in stellar material ( hoyle & fowler 1960 ) .",
    "the absence of hydrogen in the spectra of the sne ia almost immediately suggested that they were due to thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "isolated white dwarfs were once thought to be possible progenitors ( finzi & wolf 1967 ) , but soon discarded due to incompatibility with basic results from stellar evolution .",
    "instead , accretion of matter from a close companion star in a binary system , by a previously formed c+o white dwarf with a mass close to the chandrasekhar mass , provides a viable mechanism to induce the explosion ( wheeler & hansen 1971 ) .    two main competing production channels are still under discussion nowadays .",
    "one possible path is the so  called single degenerate ( sd ) channel , where a c+o white dwarf grows in mass by accretion from a non  degenerate stellar companion : a main sequence star , a subgiant , a helium star , a red giant , or an agb star ( whelan & iben 1973 ; nomoto 1982 ) .",
    "another possible path is the double degenerate ( dd ) channel ( webbink 1984 ; iben & tutukov 1984 ) , where two wds merge due to the loss of angular momentum by gravitational radiation .",
    "the merging could produce the collapse of the white dwarf ( saio & nomoto 1985 ) , or it can produce a larger c+o white dwarf configuration that then explodes ( pakmor et al .",
    "2012 ) .    in the decade of the 90 s , the variety amongst sne ia was discovered , ranging from events such as sn 1991bg to those as sn 1991 t , through normal sne ia ( see filippenko 1997a , b ; branch et al .",
    "2007 ; leibundgut 2011 ) .",
    "such diversity was made amenable for cosmology when the correlation of the luminosity at the maximum of the light curve of each sn ia with its rate of decline was parameterized ( phillips 1993 , 1999 ; riess , press & kirshner 1995 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "it became clear , then , that sne ia could be used as distance indicators in cosmology , and that led to the aforementioned discovery .",
    "yet , the first decade of the new century has brought new surprises : super  chandrasekhar supernovae , as well as extremly faint ones ( see below ) .",
    "neither of them are useful for cosmology , although they are not a severe nuisance there , since they can be easily identified , and eliminated from the large samples of sne ia collected for cosmological probes .",
    "also , various teams have started to measure supernova rates at a wide variety of redshifts .",
    "the idea of using sne ia rates to discover the nature of the progenitor systems has now become an active line of research .",
    "finally , high  resolution spectroscopic observations of sn have yielded the surprising result of time ",
    "varying absorptions , which indicate the existence of outflows in the circumstellar medium surrounding some sn , and points to possible nova activity previous to the explosion .",
    "an intriguing c ii feature has been identifieed , close to the si ii line typical of sne ia , and that has led to thinking in two different directions : either the thermonuclear flame does not burn the outermost layers of the white dwarf , or maybe c is a signature of the merged white dwarf companion of the sn .",
    "there are also better estimates of the maximum h mass that could be present in the envelopes of the pre ",
    "sne , if the explosions were triggered by accretion from a non  degenerate companion .",
    "there is continued failure to detect h from the radio emission of the sne ia , and there could be constraints from the x  ray emission as well .",
    "the task of searching for the companion star in galactic supernovae has already given some definite results , and there are , now , simulations of the impact of the sn ejecta on the companion star that can be compared with the observations .    in the following sections , we present and",
    "discuss those new results . in section 2 we briefly review the different models proposed to explain the sn ia phenomenon .",
    "section 3 examines how the delay time distribution ( dtd ) constrains the possible sn ia progenitors . in section 4",
    "we discuss the carbon and oxygen absorption features seen , in recent years , in the spectra of sn ia at early times , while section 5 deals with the emission features at late times .",
    "section 6 discusses the variable blueshifted sodium feature seen in some sne ia .",
    "the x  ray constraints are presented in section 7 , and the radio constraints in section 8 . in section 9",
    "we report the limits on the luminosities of the companions of sne ia obtained from pre  explosion images .",
    "section 10 deals with the detection of companions throught the early light curves of sne ia .",
    "section 11 reviews the direct searches for surviving companions , in the galaxy and in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "section 12 deals with the identification of possible candidates to sne ia through reconstruction of the orbital evolution of diverse close binary systems containing white dwarfs .",
    "section 13 addresses the important problem of the outliers from the peak brightness ",
    "decline rate of the light curve relationship used to make these sne calibrated candles for cosmology .",
    "section 14 deals with the bulk of sne ia used for cosmology .",
    "we summarize the current state of affairs in the last section .",
    "an ideally complete model of a type ia supernova should start from the formation and subsequent evolution of the binary system assumed to originate it , include possible common envelope episodes , mass tranfer stages ( generally nonconservative ) , especially those immediately leading to the explosion , rotational states of the two stars involved , and finally the ignition process and its development into a full thermonuclear explosion ( hydrodynamics and nucleosynthesis ) . from that",
    ", light curves and spectra of the emitted light should be computed , for the different stages of the outburst ( extending until the nebular phase ) .",
    "the characteristics of the resulting remnants should be predicted as well .",
    "in addition , the frequency of the explosions corresponding to the model has to be estimated , for different galactic environments .",
    "the whole programme involves very diverse domains of expertise , so the progress has been disperse .",
    "those models were first proposed by webbink ( 1984 ) and by iben & tutukov ( 1984 ) .",
    "the most favored scenario , in the latter work , started from binaries with component masses in the range 59 @xmath0 .",
    "they experienced two common envelope stages and ended as a pair of c+o white dwarfs , with masses in the range 0.71 @xmath0 , separated by distances 0.20.35 @xmath1 and orbiting each other with periods @xmath2 between 12 min and 14 hrs .",
    "the system then losses angular momentum by emission of gravitational waves and the two white dwarfs merge on a time scale ranging from 10@xmath3 to 10@xmath4 yr ( merging of binaries due to the emission of gravitational radiation had already been considered by tutukov & yungelson 1979 )",
    ". the merging would occur through disruption of the less massive component of the system .",
    "that component fills its roche lobe first ( larger radius and smaller roche lobe ) . the mass transfer , then , should have a runaway character , since the more mass the white dwarf losses , the larger its radius becomes ( and the smaller its roche lobe ) .",
    "the material of the disrupted white dwarf would form a thick disk around the more massive one , which would accrete mass from it until reaching the chandrasekhar limit and explosively ignite c at its centre . with the caveat that the effects on the orbit of the two common envelope phases could only be roughly approximated , iben & tutukov ( 1984 ) found that the rate of such mergings might , alone , account for the galactic sn ia rate .    in the preceding scenario",
    ", it was assumed that the only effect of the accretion of matter by the more massive white dwarf , from the debris of its companion , should be growth up to the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "that was soon challenged by saio & nomoto ( 1985 ) , who argued that a very fast mass transfer ( @xmath5 ) would produce an off  centre c flash .",
    "a c  burning front would then propagate ( nonexplosively ) down to the centre of the white dwarf , changing the chemical composition from c+o to o+ne+mg along the way .",
    "electron captures on mg and ne would subsequently make the chandrasekhar mass smaller than the white dwarf mass , and gravitational collapse would ensue .",
    "the outcome should thus be the formation of a neutron star , rather than a sn ia explosion .",
    "nomoto & iben ( 1985 ) further concluded that the off ",
    "centre c ignition would always occur unless the mass accretion rate were less than one  fifth of the eddington limit for an isolated white dwarf . later hydrodynamic simulations ( benz et al . 1990 ; guerrero et al .",
    "2004 ) have confirmed that a heavy accretion disk is formed around the most massive white dwarf . whether a sn ia ensues would depend on the mass accretion rate of the white dwarf from the disk , that being determined by the viscosity of the latter :",
    "a sufficiently low viscosity would allow the white dwarf to grow while avoiding the off  centre , non  explosive ignition of c ( mochkovich , guerrero & segretain 1997 ) .",
    "the issue remains open .",
    "another effect of mass acccretion from a massive disk should be the gain of angular momentum by the white dwarf .",
    "its consequences have been studied by piersanti et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) and tornamb & piersanti ( 2013 ) .",
    "they find that rotation can stabilize the white dwarf against contraction , even when its mass becomes larger than the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "later , loss of angular momentum by emission of gravitational waves allows contraction , until the conditions for explosive c ignition are reached at the centre .",
    "recently , lebanon , soker & garcia  berro ( 2014 ) find constraints on the classical dd type of progenitor from the disk  originated matter around the exploding wd , as this matter will be shocked by the sn ejecta and end up in a radiation implying a larger progenitor radius than observed .",
    "a different approach is based on the violent merging of a pair of white dwarfs ( pakmor et al .",
    "another possibility is the direct collision of a pair of white dwarfs .",
    "such collisions could take place in environments of high star number density , like globular clusters or the galactic centre ( benz et al . 1989 ) , and also in triple star systems where a close pair of white dwarfs have their orbits perturbed by the third , more distant star ( thompson 2011 ; katz & dong 2012 ; kushnir et al .",
    "2013 ; dong et al .",
    "2014 ) . in the hydrodynamic simulations of pakmor",
    "et al . ( 2010 ) , the merging of two equal mass ( @xmath6 ) white dwarfs produced a subluminous sn ia .",
    "further modeling ( pakmor et al .",
    "2011 ) has shown that violent mergings where the primary mass is @xmath6 can give rise to subluminous sne ia for unequal masses too , provided that the mass ratio is more than about 0.8 .",
    "later on , pakmor et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have found that the violent merging of two c+o white dwarfs , with masses 0.9 m@xmath7 and 1.1 m@xmath7 ( assumed to induce the detonation of the c+o mixture ) can account for normal sne ia as well .",
    "that has been very recently confirmed by garca ",
    "senz et al . (",
    "2013 ) , who find that the amount of @xmath8ni produced in the collisions ranges from 0.1 m@xmath7 to 1.1 m@xmath7 , thus covering from subluminous through normal up to overluminous sne ia .",
    "they argue , however , that given the distribution of white dwarf masses , mostly subluminous events should arise . on the other hand , ruiter et al .",
    "( 2013 ) find that the brightness distribution of the explosions produced by violent mergers matches the shape of that observed for sne ia ( although the issue depends on the occurrence of a particular phase of mass accretion during binary evolution ) . very recently , kromer et al .",
    "( 2013a ) have successfully explained the narrow emission lines of [ o i ] in the late  time spectra of sn 2010lp ( a subluminous sn ia ) by the violent merger of two c+o white dwarfs , with masses of 0.9 and 0.76 m@xmath7 .",
    "even more recently , moll et al . (",
    "2013 ) have found that prompt detonations following the merging of two white dwarfs can not only reproduce both common and overluminous sne ia , but also the width ",
    "luminosity relation on which the use of these supernovae as cosmological distance indicators is based .",
    "a key point , though , is whether there are or not enough close binary white dwarf binaries to account for the rate of occurrence of sne ia .",
    "one approach to this problem is to look for such systems in the galaxy .",
    "napiwotzki et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have reported the results of a systematic radial velocity survey for double degenerate binaries as potential progenitors of type ia supernovae .",
    "more than 1000 wds and pre  white dwarfs were observed with the vlt .",
    "the frequency of he wds is much higher than that of c+o wds , and they regard he wd donors as a possible important channel for sne ia .",
    "recently , badenes & maoz ( 2012 ) , using multi  epoch spectroscopy of @xmath9 4000 white dwarfs from the sloan digital sky survey , have determined the white dwarf merger rate per unit stellar mass in our galaxy .",
    "they find that the total rate might well account for the sn ia rate in the milky way and galaxies of the same type , but that the rate of merging of pairs of white dwarfs with a total mass above the chandrasekhar mass is only @xmath91/14 of the total rate .",
    "so , unless sub  chandrasekhar mergers can produce sne ia , the double  degenerate channel should be , at most , a minor contributor to the sn ia phenomenon .",
    "sn ia models based on the non  violent merging of two white dwarfs , with a total mass below the chandrasekhar mass , involve a c+o plus a he white dwarf .",
    "the he accreted by the more massive ( c+o ) white dwarf detonates and the shock wave thus generated can either induce the detonation of the c+o layers immediately below or converge near the centre and produce a c+o detonation there ( sim et .",
    "al . 2012 ) .",
    "these authors find that the light curves and spectra of such explosions do match those observed in sne ia .",
    "besides , ruiter et al .",
    "( 2011 ) had calculated that if those double  detonation models were able to produce explosions similar to sne ia , then the sub ",
    "chandrasekhar explosions would account for a substantial fraction , at least , of the observed sn ia rate .",
    "they also found that the double white dwarf channel involving a c+o plus a he white dwarf should have a distribution of delay times ( between formation of the binary and the sn explosion ) spanning from 800 myr up to the hubble time .",
    "the channel leading to a sn ia explosion via mass accretion , by a c+o white dwarf , from a non  degenerate binary companion , was first modelled by whelan & iben ( 1973 ) , although the idea , as we have seen , already appears in wheeler & hansen ( 1971 ) : a primary with a mass of 1.83 @xmath0 , plus a secondary with @xmath10 , initially form a system with an orbital period between 5 and 9 years .",
    "the primary then evolves and becomes a c+o white dwarf , with a mass close to the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "the secondary , after @xmath9 10@xmath4 yr , becomes an agb star , fills its roche lobe , and transfers mass to the white dwarf , which then reaches the chandrasekhar mass and explodes . in this first model",
    ", the mass of the secondary was chosen to explain the occurrence of sne ia in elliptical galaxies , long after star formation has stopped .",
    "subsequently , a variety of initial binary systems , in which mass accretion by the white dwarf can take place at different evolutionary stages of its companion ( main sequence , subgiant , red giant , agb ) , and either from roche lobe overflow or from a stellar wind , have been proposed .",
    "also , mass loss by the two components of the binary can take place more than once , as well as mass transfer ( either conservative or non  conservative ) .",
    "the possibility that the companion might have lost its hydrogen  rich envelope and become a helium star , at the time of mass tranfer to the white dwarf , has also been considered .",
    "a problem common to both the single  degenerate models and to the double  degenerate models , in which the conditions for explosive c ignition , close to the centre of the c+o white dwarf , are reached when the white dwarf mass has grown to the chandrasekhar mass ( or when rotational support has been lost , for masses above such limit ) , is that thermonuclear burning propagation should be subsonic at first ( deflagration ) and , at some point , become supersonic ( detonation ) .",
    "if only deflagrations were involved , the explosions could just produce a subclass of subluminous sne ia ( fink et al .",
    "on the other hand , pure detonations of chandrasekhar  mass white dwarfs would burn the c+o mixture to fe ",
    "peak elements entirely , in stark contrast with the observations , that show intermediate  mass elements at and around maximum light .",
    "a self  consistent modeling of the deflagration / detonation transition still remains elusive , although steady progress is being made ( woosley 2007 ; aspden , bell & woosley 2010 ; schmidt et al . 2010 ; woosley , kerstein & aspden 2011 ) .",
    "there is another problem that only concerns single ",
    "degenerate models of sne ia : the possible explosive ignition of the material ( hydrogen or helium ) accumulated on the surface of the accreting c+o white dwarf , before the latter reaches the chandrasekhar mass . also , in the case of hydrogen , a high rate of accretion may not lead to explosion but to the formation of an extended envelope , which would be ejected by interaction with the mass  donor star , that terminating the accretion process .",
    "accumulation of hydrogen on the surface of a white dwarf at a low rate should produce nova  like explosions , in which all the accreted material ( and maybe even more ) would be expelled ( nomoto 1982 ; livio & truran 1992 ) .",
    "the lower limit on the mass  accretion rate , to avoid explosions and strong flashes , is uncertain and depends on the mass of the white dwarf , but a value @xmath11 is often given , although kercek , hillebrandt & truran ( 1999 ) , in 3d simulations , obtained steady hydrogen burning for rates as low as @xmath12 ( see discussion in hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 ) .",
    "even if hydrogen is burned steadily or in weak flashes , the resulting helium layer should explosively burn , in a detonation , if the rate of accumulation of helium were @xmath13 ( although this is only true for white dwarf masses @xmath14 ) .",
    "the same applies to the direct accretion of helium .",
    "lower rates would thus be excluded from the production of chandrasekhar  mass explosions , but they could lead to sub ",
    "chandrasekhar , edge  lit explosions , instead .",
    "the explosion of helium shells in accreting white dwarfs as a type ia sn mechanism was first proposed by taam ( 1980 ) and nomoto ( 1982a ) ( the `` double detonation '' model ) , and numerically studied , in one  dimensional ( 1d ) numerical simulations , by woosley , taam & weaver ( 1986 ) , and by livne ( 1990 ) .",
    "the earliest 2d simulations were made by livne & glasner ( 1991 ) .",
    "such explosions were further investigated by woosley & weaver ( 1994 ) , and by livne & arnett ( 1995 ) .",
    "the `` robustness '' of the double detonation model has been recently checked in 2d and 3d simulations by moll & woosley ( 2013 ) , whilst the conditions for producing helium detonations have been examined by woosley & kasen ( 2011 ) .",
    "the first evidence of a sub  chandrasekhar explosion was found by ruiz ",
    "lapuente et al . (",
    "1993 ) ( later confirmed by mazzali et al . 1997 ) , from modeling the spectra of sn 1991bg . whether double detonation models produce explosions characteristically similar to those of sne ia",
    "remains an open question , but ruiter et al .",
    "( 2011 ) find that the helium star channel would have delay times @xmath15 500 myr ( `` prompt explosions '' ) , while the double white dwarf channel ( c+o plus he white dwarf ) would have longer delay times , as mentioned above .",
    "successful accretion of hydrogen , leading to growth of a c+o white dwarf up to the chandrasekhar mass through steady shell hydrogen and helium burning , thus requires high accretion rates .",
    "that can be achieved for binary stellar companions at different stages ot their evolution , but if hydrogen accumulates faster than it can be burned , a red giant  like structure should form , soon engulfing the companion and leading to a common  envelope stage . a solution to this problem",
    "was found by hachisu , kato & nomoto ( 1996 ) : when the mass accretion rate exceeds the maximum rate at which hydrogen can be burned , there is no static envelope solution , and the excess material is blown off in a wind .",
    "the optically thick wind solution had been previously found to explain the light curves of nova outbursts by kato & hachisu ( 1994 ) .",
    "white dwarfs accreting mass at high rates should emit large amounts of radiation in the x  ray band , and they should appear as luminous supersoft x  ray sources ( van den heuvel et al . 1992 ; di stefano & nelson 1996 ; yungelson et al . 1996 ; kahabka & van den heuvel 1997 ; li & van den heuvel 1997 ; orio 2006 ) .",
    "however , as we will see in section 7 , that might be in conflict with the observed x ",
    "ray emission of elliptical galaxies and galaxy bulges .",
    "another possible channel involving a c+o white dwarf plus a non  degenerate companion star is the core ",
    "degenerate scenario recently advocated by soker ( 2013 ) : a chandrasekhar or super  chandrasekhar white dwarf is formed from the merging of a white dwarf with the hot , more massive core of an agb star . the initial white dwarf is disrupted and its material accreted by the agb core , that leading to the formation of a rapidly spinning , more massive white dwarf .",
    "the delay time till explosion would then be given by the spin ",
    "down time of the new white dwarf .",
    "mergings of a white dwarf with the core of an agb star , following a common  envelope episode , had also been considered as a production mechanism of sne ia by sparks & stecher ( 1974 ) and by livio & riess ( 2003 ) .",
    "soker et al .",
    "( 2013 , 2014 ) have proposed the core  degenerate scenario to explain the characteristics of two very different sne : ptf11kx and sn 2011fe .",
    "in the preceding , we have not dealt with the especifics of the hydrodynamic modeling of the different types of explosions surveyed , which has reached unprecedented standards of realism ( see hillebrandt et al .",
    "they are being matched by 3d models of the spectra that should arise from the explosions ( baron , hauschildt & chen 2009 ) .",
    "the delay time distribution ( dtd ) is given by the time evolution of the sn rate that would follow an instantaneous burst of star formation .",

    ".    early research on sne ia rates and dtds indicated the need of a two  component model at least : one that could be fitted with a short dtd population ( @xmath22 yr ) and another one with a long dtd population ( 34 gyr ) ( scannapieco & bildsten 2005 ; mannucci et al .",

    "more recently , shappee , kochanek & stanek ( 2013 ) have claimed that , in the case of a main sequence companion ( and maximizing the heating ) , the object should remain significantly overluminous for the above time lapse , but the more realistic simulations of pan , ricker & taam ( 2012b ) , also for a main  sequence star , predict luminosities much closer to that of tycho g , @xmath79 yr after the explosion . in the case of a subgiant , a larger fraction of the material",

    "that has been questioned by di stefano , voss & claeys ( 2011 ) , who propose a model in which the c+o white dwarf , spun  up by accretion of matter and angular momentum , is able to sustain a mass above the chandrasekhar mass , and only reaches the conditions for explosive c burning when it has lost enough angular momentum , on a time scale that may be long enough to allow the companion star to evolve to the white dwarf stage . also , overcoming the chandrasekhar ",

    "the highlight , here , is that the companions to sne ia , at the time of explosion , are very unlikely to be red giants or supergiants , as well as massive main  sequence or subgiant stars .",
    "this result comes from searches for companion stars in sne ia remnants , in our galaxy and in the lmc ; by looking at pre  explosion images of nearby sne ia , like sn 2011fe ; from x  ray surveys of sne ia made with _ swift _ ; from radio observations of nearby sne ia , and from confrontation of the early light curves of sne ia with theoretical predictions .    on the other hand ,",
    "the much expanded surveys for transients , at different wavelengths , have found from very dim explosions to overluminous outbursts .",
    "multidimensional modeling of different types of thermonuclear explosions has reached a new level of realism , and they are confronted with observations uncovering the different layers of the exploding objects with unprecedented detail .",
    "we still lack , however , the identification of a sne ia with the dismissal of some previously observed object .    two different channels ( sd and dd ) leading to sn ia explosions still appear to be required , although the balance has now shifted towards the double  degenerate channel , where violent mergings or violent collisions of white dwarfs appear as a promising mechanism .",
    "the initial conditions leading to such collisions are still unclear , however . for subluminous sne ia of the sne iax type , or ca  rich transients , edge",
    " lit he detonations that might not disrupt the underlying c+o wd , or failed deflagrations in the outer shells , seem able to account for the observations and for the rates of the explosions .",
    "from all the preceding , we can reach some tentative conclusions about the fraction of supernovae arising from different kinds of progenitor systems and their explosion mechanisms ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "@xmath110 the supernovae that show unburnt carbon make 30% of the sne ia class . if we add to that the super  chandrasekhar explosions ( 2@xmath30 ) , we can infer that around 32% of thermonuclear supernovae should arise from the merging of two white dwarfs . tamped detonations in rapidly rotating white dwarfs",
    "may be the explosion mechanism , in the super  chandrasekhar case , although mergings of massive white dwarfs could also account for these events .",
    "@xmath110 between 31@xmath92 @xmath30 and 5.6@xmath93 of all sne ia do belong to the iax subtype , likely arising either from failed deflagrations or from surface detonations of low  mass white dwarfs .",
    "the large error bars come from the uncertainty on the selection effects that work against detection of subluminous events .",
    "there are indications that this subclass of sne ia with low ejection velocities do , in fact , split into two subclasses .",
    "further research in this are is needed .",
    "@xmath110 there is a 15@xmath30 of sne ia of the 91bg  type , which are tentatively associated with violent mergings of white dwarfs where the primary is of about 0.9 m@xmath7 .",
    "detonation of the c+o mixture should then occur .",
    "@xmath110 the fraction of explosions resulting from the accretion of hydrogen from a red giant star seems to be very low , as metioned before .",
    "the sne coming from a symbiotic progenitor should only make 0.11@xmath30 of all sne ia .",
    "@xmath110 about 12% of events have luminosities falling well in the middle of the bulk of sne ia , but they rise fast and do decline very fast after maximum ( the fraction migh be larger , due to selection effects ) .",
    "their origin remains unclear .",
    "@xmath110 the remaining fraction of sne ia , a 21 @xmath30 , could come from systems made of a c+o white dwarf plus a main  sequence or subgiant star , and they could appear , before the explosion , as supersoft x  ray sources or / and recurrent novae . in the sn of this and the former group ( as well as in those coming from non  violent dd mergings ) ,",
    "the explosion should start as a ( generally off  centre ) deflagration , to become a detonation in reaching lower ",
    "density layers .",
    "given the large sample of peculiar sne ia , it is worth obtaining spectral sequences , when using sn for cosmology .",
    "such project would be made possible by dedicated space missions and by ground ",
    "based programs ( wood  vasey 2010 ) .",
