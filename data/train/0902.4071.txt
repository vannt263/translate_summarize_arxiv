    "all high - redshift quasar spectra with a complete gp trough ( gunn & peterson 1965 ) exhibit transmitted flux in an extended region between the quasar redshift and the red side of the gp trough ( fan 2006 , f06 ) .",
    "these transmission windows provide a powerful , and so far unique , probe of the physical state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) beyond redshift @xmath7 , where the onset of the gp trough erases the information encoded in the forest .",
    "the detection of transmitted flux at such high redshift provides a solid evidence for a reduced neutral hydrogen fraction ( ) within distances of several physical mpc from the quasar ( f06 ) . such decrease can be attributed to the locally enhanced photoionization rate produced by the quasar ultraviolet radiation .",
    "however , the physical interpretation of such transmission windows in terms of the igm properties is not straightforward . are these transmission windows the spectral counterparts of quasar _ regions _ ( hr ) , with the red side of the gp trough corresponding to the location of the quasar ionization front ? or are they instead _ proximity regions _ ( pr )",
    "resulting from the reduced optical depth in the vicinity of a quasar whose region extends further into the igm ? we will refer to these two interpretations as the hr and pr regime , respectively .",
    "it has been demonstrated that both regimes can be used to reproduce the observed spectra , depending on the assumed quasar luminosity and lifetime , and the ionization and thermal state of the surrounding igm ( bolton & haehnelt 2007a ; maselli 2007 [ m07 ] ; wyithe , bolton & haehnelt 2008 [ w08 ] ) .",
    "previous studies have shown that under the assumption of the hr regime , the relatively small extent of the observed transmission windows detected in current data would imply a significant neutral hydrogen fraction still present at @xmath8 , , that is @xmath9 ( wyithe & loeb 2004 ; wyithe , loeb & carilli 2005 ; f06 ) .",
    "these results are supported by independent analysis which do not explicitly assume the hr regime , based either on fitting the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the optical depth , @xmath10 , within the transmission windows ( mesinger & haiman 2007 ) , or on the comparison of and ly@xmath11 absorption spectra ( mesinger & haiman 2004 ) .",
    "however , it is difficult to reconcile these results with the analysis of dark gaps in quasars / gamma - ray bursts absorption spectra ( gallerani 2008a , 2008b ) , as well as with other independent probes of the hydrogen reionization history , as the lyman alpha emitters surveys ( malhotra & rhoads 2006 ; dawson 2007 ) , and the integrated electron scattering optical depth measured by wmap5 data release ( komatsu 2009 ) .",
    "all these studies suggest @xmath12 at @xmath8 and are consistent with the detection of transmitted flux in high - redshift quasar spectra provided that the pr interpretation of the transmission windows applies . in this regime ,",
    "the spectral extent of the windows is set by the onset of the gp trough _ within _ the quasar region . in m07",
    "this effect has been termed _",
    "apparent shrinking _ , to indicate the possibility that the physical extent of the transmitting window , @xmath0 , does not correspond to the actual region size , @xmath2 , and in fact underestimates it .",
    "the condition @xmath13 is likely to arise from the combination of two factors : ( i ) the average igm density gets high enough to produce complete absorption in spite of the high gas ionization level , and ( ii ) the quasar photo - ionization rate drops below the minimum value required to preserve igm transparency inside the quasar region .    to discriminate between the hr and pr regimes we propose here a simple ( but yet solid ) criterion , the apparent shrinking criterion ( asc ) .",
    "such method , in addition , allows to determine @xmath14 in the hr regime , or to quantify local deviations from the mean cosmic photoionization rate along the line of sight ( los ) to the quasar if the pr regime holds .",
    "in this section we introduce the basic idea underlying the _ apparent shrinking criterion _ , whose main use is to discriminate between the hr and pr scenarios described above by using a given high - redshift quasar spectrum .",
    "the asc is based on the comparison among three spatial scales : ( a ) the physical size of the spectral transmission window , @xmath0 , ( b ) the size of the quasar region , @xmath2 , and ( c ) the maximum value that @xmath0 can take , @xmath15 .",
    "these are discussed separately in the following .",
    "@xmath0 is a directly measurable quantity in high-@xmath1 quasar spectra and it denotes the physical extent of the spectral region close to the quasar in which a non - zero flux can be detected .",
    "the determination of this quantity is affected by uncertainties on quasar redshift , @xmath16 , and on the flux detection limit of the instrument .",
    "an additional complication is represented by the fact that the igm transmissivity at @xmath17 is a mixture of dark gaps and transmission peaks , which makes the identification of the red side boundary of the gp trough uncertain ( e.g. isolated peaks in the translucent igm can merge with the transmission window region associated to the quasar ) . here",
    "we adopt the operational definition given in f06 , which states that   represents the physical distance from the quasar at which , when smoothed by a top - hat filter of 20   , the observed flux drops below a transmission threshold of 0.1 ( corresponding to a optical depth @xmath18 ) .",
    "@xmath2 denotes the mean radius of the quasar region . due to the gas inhomogeneities and to radiative transfer effects , quasar regions deviate significantly ( up to 15% , e.g. m07 ) from spherical symmetry with a resulting variation of the region radius along different los ( see for example fig .",
    "[ los ] ) .",
    "previous studies including rt calculations have shown that the radius of a quasar region expanding in a homogeneous igm approximates well the actual mean value of @xmath2 along different lines of sight in the inhomogeneous case .",
    "hence , we use the following expression to determine the average hii region size : [ rhii ] r_hii3.3 ( ) ^1/3 ( ) ^-1 x_hi^-1/3 mpc , the above expression is valid under the additional assumption that the quasar lifetime , @xmath19  yr , is shorter than the gas ( volume - averaged ) recombination timescale , t_rec ( ) = 2.6   c^-1 ( 1+z7)^-3  gyr ; [ trecn ] where the clumping factor @xmath20 is meant to include the effects of density inhomogeneities inside the ionized region ; we have used a helium to hydrogen number ratio @xmath21 .",
    "due to its low density , typical igm recombination times are long , and exceed @xmath22 .",
    "a third fundamental spatial scale entering the formulation of the asc is set by the monotonic dependence of the mean transmitted flux , @xmath23 , on the distance from the quasar .",
    "the detection of the gp trough in all spectra of quasars with @xmath7 implies that at these redshifts the mean igm opacity grows large enough to completely suppress transmission ; due to instrumental sensitivity the detection of gp trough implies an upper limit on the mean transmitted flux of @xmath24 .",
    "( see f06 ) . as a result of their large ionizing power , in the vicinity of extremely luminous quasars the igm opacity",
    "is suppressed with respect to average and some flux shortwards of the line can be detected . due to the geometrical dilution of the quasar ionizing flux",
    ", @xmath25 is a monotonically decreasing function of the distance from the quasar , @xmath26 , and it will eventually fall below the detection threshold @xmath27 ; at even larger distances , the quasar photoionization rate drops below the one produced by the background sources ( qsos and galaxies ) . given the quasar ionizing photon rate , @xmath28 , and the mean intensity of the ionizing background ( or equivalently , ) , one can define a radius @xmath3 , as _ the distance from the quasar such that @xmath29 _ , under the hypothesis that the quasar flux extends to infinity .",
    "stated differently ,   represents the maximum spatial extent of the transmission window @xmath0 associated to a given quasar .",
    "how can we estimate @xmath3 ?",
    "analogously to @xmath2 in eq .",
    "[ rhii ] , is calculated in the ideal case of a uniform igm ; deviations might occur due to fluctuations along different los , as well as to uncertainties in the modeling of the igm and quasar properties .",
    "these effects will be quantified in the next section .    for a uniform igm",
    "the mean optical depth can be expressed as a function of redshift and of the neutral hydrogen density as follows : [ tau ] = 4.25 10 ^ 5 h^-1 x_hi ( ) ^-0.5 ( ) ( ) ^3/2 , where @xmath30 denotes the gas overdensity .",
    "the mean transmitted flux is however sensitive to the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the density field , @xmath31 , and can be estimated as : [ meanflux ] f & = & p ( ) e^- ( ) d. as quasars typically reside in biased ( i.e. high-@xmath32 peaks ) regions of the cosmic density distribution , @xmath31 might differ in their vicinity from the one describing the general igm .",
    "under these conditions we do expect in particular that the peak of the pdf is shifted towards larger @xmath33 values . in the following ,",
    "though , we will neglect this bias , as both theoretical models ( barkana 2002 ; wang 2009 ) and observations ( guimares 2007 ) find the ambient overdensity to be significant only within a distance ( @xmath34  mpc ) much smaller than the observed values of @xmath0 : the minimum value measured to date is the one in the quasar j1623 + 3112 at @xmath35 with @xmath36  mpc .    in general",
    ", @xmath25 is a function of the distance @xmath26 from the quasar , through the dependence of @xmath10 on , as in eq .",
    "[ tau ] . the neutral fraction , in turn , can be derived from the condition of photoionization equilibrium at any given @xmath33 once the local photoionization rate @xmath37 is assigned .",
    "close to the quasar , @xmath38 , with @xmath39 denoting the frequency - averaged photoionization hydrogen cross - section ; furthermore within distances @xmath40 , @xmath41 , the mean value in the igm .",
    "the expression for @xmath42 given above neglects the flux suppression due to residual in the ionized region ; as discussed later on , this is a good approximation supported by the results from full 3d cosmological radiative transfer simulations .",
    "an additional contribution , @xmath5 , to the total photoionization rate along the los can come from galaxies intervening along the line of sight",
    ".    then the local photoionization rate can be expressed as : [ gamma ] ( r)= _ b + _ g ( r ) + _ q(r ) .",
    "we initially neglect @xmath5 and assume that @xmath43 extends to infinity ( with no truncation at the region ionization front whose location is unknown ) , and discuss the implications of such assumption in sec .  4 .    in summary ,",
    "the estimate of the value associated to a given quasar requires an _ a priori _ knowledge of @xmath28 , @xmath44 and of the mean igm temperature , @xmath45 , which enters the determination of   ( and @xmath10 , see eq .",
    "[ tau ] ) via the recombination rate .",
    "we discuss the choice of these quantities and the associated uncertainties in sec .",
    "3 . once these quantities are fixed ,   can be estimated from photoionization equilibrium , and by requiring that @xmath46 . from the analysis of rt calculations",
    ", it appears that photoionization equilibrium is a good approximation in the cases of interest .",
    "note that , is univocally determined by such procedure , being @xmath47 a monotonically increasing function of @xmath26 as a consequence of the geometrical dilution of the quasar ionizing flux .",
    "now that we have all the necessary definitions at hand , we can describe the formulation of the asc .",
    "as anticipated above , the asc is based on the comparison between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the first case , @xmath48 , corresponds to the pr scenario , i.e. a situation in which the the quasar photoionization rate is too low to keep the gas sufficiently transparent within its own region . under these conditions ,",
    "the measured size of the transmission window will be equal to its theoretically determined value , @xmath49 , within uncertainties .",
    "it has already been shown that this situation is likely to occur in an ionized universe where quasar regions can expand several tens of mpc into the igm ( bolton & haehnelt 2007 ; m07 ) , albeit it could also be found in an almost neutral gas provided that the quasar luminosity and lifetime are large enough to power a rapid growth of @xmath2 .",
    "if instead @xmath50 ( hr regime ) , the extent of the transmission window is set by the size of the region , by the sharp   discontinuity at the location of the ionization front . in this case",
    "@xmath51 : by construction ,   represents the upper limit to @xmath0 obtained by assuming that quasar ionizing flux extends to infinity .",
    "the hr regime usually occurs when   is large ( small @xmath52 ) and the quasar ionizing flux is suppressed abruptly while still dominant over the ultra violet background ( uvb ) .",
    "if the hr regime holds , the measured value @xmath0 gives an estimate of   via eq .",
    "[ rhii ] as first proposed by wyithe & loeb ( 2004 ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that , by their own operational definition , the pr and hr regimes are not associated to a particular phase of the reionization process .",
    "note that , according to our definition , it is always @xmath53 , within errors .",
    "however , is determined under the assumption that @xmath54 , neglecting a possible contribution to @xmath55 by sources other than the quasar and the uvb .",
    "this might well not be the case .",
    "however , it is easy to isolate the effects of contributing sources ( most likely galaxies ) along the los which would be signaled by a larger than expected value @xmath56 . in this case",
    "one would conclude that @xmath57 ; in addition , it will be also possible to obtain a quantitative estimate of such contribution by using eqs .",
    "[ tau]@xmath58[gamma ] and further imposing that @xmath59 .",
    "the application of the asc will allow to decide between the following possibilities : if @xmath60 the pr regime applies and no constraints can be put on ; if moreover @xmath56 this implies a non - vanishing contribution of galaxies to the local photoionization rate , @xmath57 .",
    "if instead @xmath61 , the hr regime applies , @xmath62 , and   can be constrained .",
    "in this section we discuss and quantify the various uncertainties involved in the determination of the three characteristic scales entering the asc , together with their associated error sources .",
    "@xmath2 denotes the average extent of the quasar region and consequently the uncertainty on this quantity is associated to fluctuations in the density field and radiative transfer effects ( shadowing , filtering and self - shielding ) which distort the shape of the quasar region ; the extent of the region is then direction - dependent .",
    "the amplitude of this effect can be estimated only with the support of 3d numerical simulations .",
    "we have then performed a set of dedicated 3d radiative transfer simulations which follow the expansion of the region in a cosmological density field for different quasars and igm parameters , as described in more details in sec .",
    "we use the outputs of such simulations to quantify the relative error @xmath63 . for each simulation",
    "we have drawn 1000 los towards the quasar and on each los we have estimated @xmath2 as the distance @xmath26 at which @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 is quantified as the 1-@xmath32 dispersion of the @xmath2 distribution derived as above .    tab .",
    "1 reports @xmath2 and the associated error for various simulation runs .",
    "we find the relative error on @xmath2 to be confined in the extremely narrow range @xmath66 , despite the wide range covered by the average extents of the regions which result from spanning over the values allowed for the simulation parameters ( @xmath28 , @xmath67 , @xmath22 ) .",
    "the extent of the transmission window is an observable quantity in the spectra of high-@xmath1 quasars whose estimate is derived from the measurement of the quasar redshift ( @xmath16 ) and the onset of the gp trough ( @xmath68 ) along a given los .",
    "the accuracy of the quasar redshift depends on the line indicators available .",
    "the most accurate determination relies on co rotational transition lines from the host galaxy . only for two of the high-@xmath1 quasars analyzed ( see sec .",
    "5 ) co detection is currently available : j1148 + 5251 ( bertoldi 2003 ) and j0927 + 2001 ( carilli 2007 ) ; for these cases redshifts are measured with an uncertainty @xmath69 . the next accurate indicator for systemic quasars redshift is the line which , despite being a broad line , allows accuracy of the order of @xmath70 ( richards 2002 ) .",
    "however the transition line has a restframe wavelength of 2800  , so that at @xmath8 it is shifted to roughly 2 @xmath71 m , thus requiring infrared spectroscopy which is not always available .",
    "when neither co and detections are available the redshift is measured via the line which has an associated error of the order of @xmath72 . in the quasars list reported in table  1 , the redshifts are tagged with a letter specifying the line indicator used .",
    "extracting an accurate measurement of @xmath73 from the observed spectra is also not trivial , as already discussed in sec .",
    "as mentioned there , we adopt the operational definition given in f06 , @xmath73 is taken as the redshift corresponding to the first pixel , moving away from the quasar location , at which the flux smoothed by a top - hat filter of 20    drops below the threshold @xmath27 . at @xmath17 , 20    correspond roughly to @xmath74 .",
    "we take the latter as a measure of the error on @xmath73 .    aside from the intrinsic error associated to the  measurement along the observed los ,",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath0 must take into account the dispersion along different lines of sight toward the same target quasar .",
    "analogously to the case of @xmath2 , quantifying such an error requires the support of 3d numerical simulations .",
    "we have used the same sample of los used for the @xmath65 determination , to extract the mock spectrum and the associated value of @xmath0 for each los ( the details of such procedure are given in sec .  4 ) .",
    "the average  values found for the various simulations are given in tab .  1 together with the associated 1-@xmath32 dispersion of the sample .",
    "as already pointed out in our previous work ( m07 ) , @xmath0 fluctuations along different los are significantly larger with respect to the @xmath2 ones : this is due to the fact that  depends on the optical depth which is extremely sensitive to tiny fluctuations of , while @xmath2 is set by the sharp  transition occurring at the ionization front . differently from @xmath2 ,",
    "has a stronger dependence on the physical state of the gas in which the quasar is embedded .",
    "we find @xmath75 values ranging from 0.17 to 0.58 , with the general trend of @xmath75 increasing with decreasing values of the ratio @xmath76 .",
    "this behavior is determined by the fact that @xmath0 gets smaller for smaller @xmath28 , while for higher @xmath44 values the dispersion , @xmath77 , increases as a consequence of a more sensitive response to density fluctuations . given the limited a - priori knowledge of @xmath76 in this study we assume the average value @xmath78 .",
    "as described in sec .",
    "2.3 , the determination of involves the assumption of the following parameters : the quasar intrinsic luminosity , @xmath28 , the gas temperature , @xmath45 , and the uvb photoionization rate , @xmath44 .",
    "quasars luminosities are commonly estimated by converting the observed magnitudes in number of ionizing photons emitted per unit time .",
    "such a procedure requires the assumption of a specific template for the quasar intrinsic spectrum , which is poorly constrained for high redshift quasars . in principle",
    "each quasar is characterized by its own spectral energy distribution and it would be possible to associate at each observed object a power law with a specific spectral index inferred from infrared data , which however are not always available for the current analysis . in the current work we derive @xmath28 by using the measured absolute magnitude @xmath79 at 1450  , and assuming the spectral template by telfer ( 2002 ) .",
    "this is the composite spectrum of lower redshift quasars ( @xmath80 ) , which is well fitted by a double power - law with a break close to the line at @xmath81    and spectral indexes @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "as done in yu & lu ( 2005 ) , we take into account the uncertainty associated to the template by considering also the telfer double power - low fits to the subsamples of radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars , which has spectral indexes ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) and ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) respectively .    the igm temperature as well as the uvb photoionization rate , @xmath44 , are also poorly constrained at high redshift .",
    "nevertheless the statistical analysis of the forest detected in high-@xmath1 quasar spectra , as well as both analytic and numerical theoretical models of the reionization process , allow to bracket the above quantities into a relatively narrow range of possible values ( choudhury & ferrara 2006 ; gallerani 2008a ) . in the application of the asc to the observed high-@xmath1 quasar spectra presented in this paper and discussed in detail in sec .  5",
    ", we assume @xmath88 to evolve according to the early reionization model ( erm ) developed by gallerani ( 2008a ) . in such model , reionization completes at @xmath89 after an extended partial ionization phase , necessary to recover the recent determination of the electron scattering optical depth found from wmap5 data ( dunkley 2009 ) .",
    "such model also simultaneously accounts for most of the available data including ly@xmath90/ly@xmath11 gp opacity , lyman limit systems , cosmic star formation history , the number density of high - redshift sources , and the luminosity functions of lyman alpha emitters at @xmath91 ( dayal 2008 ) .",
    "moreover , the uvb photoionization rate predicted by the erm is consistent with the results by bolton ( 2005 , 2007 ) in the range @xmath92 . at @xmath8",
    "the latter authors provide a solid upper limit @xmath93",
    "s@xmath94 , which we take here to quantify the uncertainties on @xmath95 .",
    "smaller values of @xmath44 do not affect significantly the estimate , due to the fact that at the characteristic distances involved ( several physical mpc ) the local photoionization rate is still dominated by the quasar ionizing flux .",
    "the erm prescribes igm temperatures in the range @xmath96  k. we take @xmath97  k , to allow for a possible local boost induced by the quasar . note in fact that , as seen from our rt simulations presented in fig .",
    "1 , the extra heating provided by the quasar can rise the gas temperature above @xmath98  k only for the case in which the quasar ionization front expands in a completely neutral gas , a possibility already excluded by various high-@xmath1 experiments ( see introduction ) .

    "the shaded region represents the error on associated to the uncertainties on the temperature and on the spectral template : the upper ( lower ) solid line connects the values associated with the larger ( smaller ) photoionization rates corresponding to the double power - law fitting the radio - quiet ( radio - loud ) composite spectrum , and to the upper ( lower ) limit on the temperature consistent with the erm , @xmath100 k ( @xmath101 k ) . note that higher temperatures at fixed density yield lower optical depths , larger transmitted fluxes and consequently higher values .",
    "2 also shows the values obtained for the fiducial @xmath45 and @xmath28 values , but with different assumptions on @xmath44 : we consider the extreme cases of ( i ) a constant @xmath44 equal to the upper limit given by bh07 of @xmath102 ( dashed - black line ) , and ( ii ) @xmath103 ( dotted - black line ) .",
    "the small differences among these two extreme cases demonstrates that uncertainties in the intensity of the uvb do not sensibly affect the asc .",
    "this results from the fact that , at the scales relevant to asc , the local ionization rate is dominated by the quasar flux , @xmath104 .    fig .",
    "[ zz ] represents the central result of this paper , i.e. the application of the asc to a sample containing the most distant quasars , and it allows to draw a number of interesting conclusions .",

    "secondly , we find @xmath105 for the quasar j1602 + 4228 at @xmath106 significance level , and for the quasars j1436 + 5007 , j1411 + 1217 , j1623 + 3112 at a lower significance level . according to the asc this occurrence signals a locally enhanced photoionization rate . as discussed in sec .",
    "2.4 this could be due to either a higher - than - average number density of galaxies clustered around the quasar or a local enhancement of more distant galaxies along the observed los , but not directly associated to the overdensity in which the quasar is located .",
    "another possibility is that the contribution to the local photoionization rate due to the galaxies around the quasar is increased by the enhanced mean free path produced by the quasar ionizing flux . in order to decide among these possibilities accurate spectroscopic redshift determinations from deep galaxy surveys of the quasars fields",
    "would be necessary , which unfortunately are not available yet .    independently of its origin , the asc allows to directly infer the amplitude of @xmath5 at @xmath0 by progressively increasing @xmath107 ( eq .  [ gamma ] ) until the condition @xmath108 is met .",
    "following this procedure we obtain : @xmath109 s@xmath94 , @xmath110 s@xmath94 , @xmath111 s@xmath94 and @xmath112 s@xmath94 .",
    "these values are comparable to the average intensity of the uvb at the same redshift : @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore , for all these four qsos , we find that @xmath5 is comparable or exceeds @xmath42 at @xmath0 , with derived values of the ratio @xmath114 .",
    "such ionizing photon contribution from galaxies is crucial to explain the width of the transmission windows .",
    "we have proposed the apparent shrinking criterion ( asc ) , a simple but yet robust semi - analytic method , based on the apparent shrinking effect ( maselli 2007 ) , which can be applied straightforwardly to the interpretation of transmission windows in the the spectra of distant quasars .",
    "the asc is based on the comparison between three spatial scales associated with a quasar : these are @xmath2 , the average physical radius of the region , the extent of the transmission window detected in its spectrum , @xmath0 , and @xmath3 , the distance from the quasar at which the mean transmitted flux drops to @xmath27 in the absence of attenuation due to either internal to the region or the ionization front of the latter .",
    "the asc applied to the spectra of single high-@xmath1 qsos provides a novel method to discriminate among the two scenarios previously proposed in the literature to explain the qso transmitted flux . in the first one the extent of the observed transmission window , @xmath0 , is set by the sharp drop of the quasar ionizing flux at the ionization front location , so that @xmath0 gives a measure of @xmath2 . if the quasar region grows large though , the unattenuated / geometrically diluted quasar flux , gets progressively weaker and eventually falls below the threshold necessary to keep the igm transparent to radiation . as a result , the observed @xmath0 saturates at the theoretically estimated upper limit @xmath3 , independently of the actual extent of the region , so that @xmath115 .",
    "we refer to the first / second case as the hii region ( hr)/proximity region ( pr ) regime , respectively . in the hr regime",
    ", one can determine , the igm mean  fraction .",
    "if the pr regime holds instead , the value of @xmath0 can be used to constrain the local ( i.e. at a distance @xmath0 from the quasar ) intensity of the ionizing radiation and indirectly infer the contribution of intervening clustered galaxies to the local photoionization rate .    as formulated in this paper ,",
    "the asc can only be applied to single objects and at the moment it is unclear whether it could be extended to get information on the average igm properties at high redshift . at the moment",
    ", the asc must be interpreted as a useful local test of reionization , in regions surrounding luminous quasars .",
    "nevertheless , by separately collecting information from a large sample of quasars in a given redshift range , the asc can eventually give new constraints on the global reionization history .",
    "we leave the analysis of this further extension of the asc for future work .",
    "the novelty introduced by the asc is that it makes possible to assess the physical regime ( hr or pr ) characterizing an observed quasar .",
    "previous works have instead focused on extracting global information on the igm redshift evolution from generic trends in the data , e.g. the dependence of @xmath0 on redshift ( f06 ; w08 ) , statistical fits to the @xmath0 distribution function ( wyithe & loeb 2004 ) , and/or fits to the flux profiles within the transmission windows ( mesinger & haiman 2007 ) .",
    "the drawback of the first two approaches is that , in order to carry such studies , it is necessary to make a scaling of @xmath0 to a reference quasar luminosity , a procedure which is valid only in the case in which the quasars are all in the hr regime . by implicitly making this assumption the information encoded in the observed spectra",
    "is degraded .",
    "the same happens in the flux profile fitting procedure , which is meant to constrain the most probable values for the triplet ( @xmath2 , @xmath28 , ) .",
    "although in this case the hypothesis that @xmath0 identifies the region radius is not made explicitly , the transmission profile shape is sensitive to the three parameters above only in the hr regime ; in the pr regime the profiles are sensitive to @xmath28 , but completely degenerate with @xmath2 , and @xmath67 .",
    "the apparent shrinking criterion has been extensively and successfully tested , by applying it to synthetic absorption spectra extracted from a set of state - of - the - art numerical simulations .",
    "next the asc has been applied to a sample of high redshift quasar spectra taken from fan ( 2006 ) .",
    "the main result is that all quasars in the analyzed sample are found to be in the pr regime and hence their spectral observables ( inner flux profile , extent of transmission windows ) can not be used to reliably constrain the value of the average igm neutral hydrogen fraction .",
    "nevertheless , for quasars in the pr regime the asc offers a novel method to determine the local photoionization rate , analogous to the proximity effect at lower redshift ( bajtlik 1988 ) . as an outcome of our analysis",
    ", we find that all the observed quasar spectra considered are consistent with the early reionization model described in gallerani ( 2008a ) , which predicts reionization to be complete at @xmath116 and thus the igm at @xmath117 to be highly ionized .    beside these general results ,",
    "we have found that four objects ( j1436 + 5007 , j1411 + 1217 , j1602 + 4228 and j1623 + 3112 ) show the presence of an additional contribution , @xmath118 , to the local photoionization rate . the origin of this extra ionizing radiation is still unclear .",
    "such flux could be provided by ( i ) galaxies clustered in the biased high density regions in which quasars are expected to form , ( ii ) a galaxy overdensity intervening along the observed los to the quasar and not directly associated to the quasar overdensity , ( iii ) galaxies within the quasar region whose contribution to the photoionization rate is boosted by the quasar - enhanced mean free path of ionizing photons .",
    "for the four quasars above we found that @xmath119 , thus showing that for these cases the galaxy ionizing flux is comparable to the quasar one at @xmath0 .",
    "the interpretation of this result within structure formation scenarios might give interesting clues on the environmental impact of high-@xmath1 quasars .",
    "in the process of testing the asc with our rt+sph simulations , we have shown a further interesting point : a correct estimate of the igm mean opacity at high-@xmath1 requires to properly weight the contribution from underdense regions with their actual probability distribution function . at high redshift in fact , fluctuations with overdensity above a certain threshold start to become opaque due to the progressive increase of the average cosmic density with @xmath1 , and hence do not contribute to transmission even if they are still highly ionized .",
    "this overdensity threshold decreases gradually with redshift and it falls significantly below unity at @xmath8 .    as a final remark",
    ", we emphasize that the lack of sample quasars in the region regime , does not dismiss the potential use of quasar transmission windows to directly measure @xmath67 at @xmath120 : in fact , we do expect that with the detection of higher redshift and/or lower luminous objects expected in the near future , spectra in the hr regime will likely be found .",
