    "the sun s velocity @xmath0 with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) is required to transform any observed heliocentric velocity to a local galactic frame . since this transformation is often necessary for scientific interpretation of observed velocities in terms of galactic structure ,",
    "the determination of @xmath0 is a fundamental task of galactic astronomy .",
    "the radial and vertical components @xmath6 and @xmath7 of @xmath0 are straightforwardly obtained from the mean heliocentric velocities of several different groups of solar - neighbourhood stars : @xmath6 and @xmath7 are simply the negative radial and vertical components of these means and @xmath7 from such means implicitly assumes that the solar neighbourhood as a whole does not move radially or vertically w.r.t .  the galaxy . that such motions are at most small is suggested by the proper motion of sgra@xmath8 @xcite and the mean radial velocity of the stars orbiting it ( e.g. *",
    "moreover , such motions should also obey an asymmetric - drift like relation ( see below ) , i.e.  the mean velocities depend systematically on velocity dispersion , which is not observed . ] .",
    "the component @xmath1 of @xmath0 in the direction of galactic rotation is much harder to determine , because the mean lag with respect to the lsr , the asymmetric drift @xmath9 , depends on the velocity dispersion @xmath10 of the respective stellar population .",
    "the classical solution to this problem exploits the empirical linear relation between the negative mean heliocentric azimuthal velocity of any stellar sample @xmath11 and its @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "hence , a straight - line fit yields @xmath1 as the value of @xmath13 for a hypothetical population of stars on circular orbits , for which @xmath14 .",
    "the theoretical underpinning of this method is the asymmetric drift relation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  4.228 ) @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is galactocentric cylindrical radius , @xmath17 the height above the plane , @xmath18 the circular speed , and @xmath19 the number density of stars , while a bar indicates a @xmath19-weighted local mean .",
    "the equation applies separately to each relaxed stellar population , for example to m stars or g stars .",
    "the idea behind the classical determination of @xmath1 is that the square bracket in equation ( [ eq : strom ] ) takes essentially identical values for each stellar population , with the consequence that a plot of @xmath13 against @xmath20 should be linear .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite , hereafter db98 ) applied this method to a sample of @xmath21 main - sequence stars from the hipparcos catalogue and their value of @xmath22 has been widely used .",
    "recent re - determinations using an improved reduction of the hipparcos data @xcite confirm the db98 value though with reduced error bars @xcite .",
    "however , two recent studies call the db98 value for @xmath1 into question . @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter b09 ) fitted distribution - function models ( a ) to velocity distributions inferred by @xcite from proper motions and photometric distances of stars in the sloan digital sky survey , and ( b ) to the space velocities of f and g in the geneva - copenhagen survey ( gcs , * ? ? ?",
    "the gcs stars are a subset of the hipparcos stars ( analysed by db98 ) for which radial velocities have been obtained .",
    "b09 was able to obtain satisfactory fits to these data only if @xmath1 was larger than the db98 value by @xmath23 , about ten times the formal error on @xmath1 .",
    "another body of evidence against the db98 value for @xmath1 originates from radio - frequency astrometry of masers in regions of massive - star formation @xcite .",
    "if the db98 value for @xmath1 is correct , these sources systematically lag circular rotation by @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "such a high systematic lag is unexpected for young stars and @xcite argued that a more plausible interpretation of the data is obtained if @xmath1 exceeds the db98 value by @xmath23 .",
    "this paper does two things : ( i ) it explains why the approach to the determination of @xmath1 by db98 and subsequent studies is misleading , and ( ii ) it determines @xmath1 from similar data but a different methodology .",
    "both these tasks are accomplished with the help of a particular chemo - dynamical model of the galaxy , that of @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter sb09a ) , but the points that we make are general ones and the role played by the sb09 model is essentially illustrative . in section  [ sec : goveqs ] we show that a metallicity gradient in the disc gives rise to distributions of mean azimuthal velocity and velocity dispersion within the colour - magnitude plane that are much more complex than one naively expects , and we show that these distributions invalidate the methodology of db98 . in section  [ sec : vsun ] we re - estimate @xmath1 by fitting the entire velocity distribution of the gcs stars to the distribution predicted by the sb09 model without reference to the strmberg relation .",
    "db98 divided their sample of hipparcos main - sequence stars into populations with different velocity dispersions by binning in  colour because colour is correlated with age and therefore with velocity dispersion . to examine the relation between colour , mean rotation velocity and velocity dispersion for stars near the sun",
    ", we employ the sb09a model of the galactic disc .",
    "this model describes the chemodynamical evolution of the thin and thick galactic discs and is a refinement of models pioneered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the disc is divided into 80 annuli , within each of which the chemical composition of the ism evolves in response to the ejection of material by dying stars , while stars form continuously with the current composition of the ism .",
    "the new features of the model are ( a ) stochastic stellar accelerations accounting for heating processes ; ( b ) radial stellar migration accounting for both non - circular orbits and guiding - centre shifts caused by stochastic resonant scattering off spiral arms @xcite ; and ( c ) transfer of gas between annuli , both as result of resonant scattering by spiral arms and as a result of a secular tendency of gas to spiral inwards through the disc .",
    "surprisingly , the model contains both thin and thick discs that are consistent with the available observational constraints @xcite .",
    "shows the model kinematics in the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "each point in colour - magnitude space defines a separate sub - population whose asymmetric drift @xmath25 and radial velocity dispersion are plotted via colour coding , such that dynamically cold and warm populations are shown with blue and red shades , respectively .",
    "the region in the colour - magnitude diagram shown in this figure corresponds to the cuts used by db98 to define their sample .",
    "our naive expectation is that as we proceed down the main sequence from its blue end towards the main - sequence turnoff at @xmath26 , we encounter successively older stars with lower mean rotation velocities and higher velocity dispersions , so in both panels of the shading should become redder as we move from left to right along the main sequence .",
    "the pattern actually found in is more complex .",
    "most notably , there is a pronounced velocity gradient _ across _ the lower main sequence . in the range @xmath27 the lower edge of the main sequence",
    "is dynamically warm ( orange in ) on account of subdwarfs , which are metal - poor and therefore old with large velocity dispersions and low mean rotation rates .",
    "the number of these subdwarfs is small , however , so they will not have a significant impact on a sample binned by colour alone .",
    "more significant is the orange shading on the upper edge of the lower main sequence , which reflects the metallicity gradient within the disc : as metallicity increases , the main sequence shifts to the right , so in the upper panel the orange upper edge of the main sequence implies that the more metal - rich stars of the solar neighbourhood are rotating more slowly because they formed at @xmath28 . to the left of @xmath29 this trend",
    "is weakened by contributions from old , sometimes metal - poor populations whose isochrones move up through this region .",
    "still the more metal - rich main - sequence stars with smaller guiding centre radii give rise to slightly higher dispersions and asymmetric drifts to the red side of the main sequence .",
    "the upper panel of shows that in the crucial colour range @xmath30 , the asymmetric drift is a complex function of colour and absolute magnitude because in this region stars of widely differing ages and metallicities are found as a result of old , metal - poor isochrones intersecting younger , metal - rich isochrones .",
    "the horizontal branch is clearly visible on both panels of as an almost horizontal feature just below @xmath31 .",
    "it is less pronounced in the upper panel because the blue end of the horizontal branch contains metal - poor stars , which tend to have large guiding - centre radii and therefore low @xmath32 even at large @xmath20 .",
    "shows the asymmetric drift @xmath32 and velocity dispersion @xmath20 obtained when stars are binned by colour alone .",
    "the lower panel can be compared with corresponding observational plots in db98 and @xcite .",
    "the model reproduces the structure of the data very well  in particular , the steepening in the slope around @xmath33 and the flatness redwards of @xmath34 .",
    "the peak in velocity dispersion seen in the lower panel of is much less evident in fig.2 of @xcite but can be traced in their @xmath35 and @xmath36 data .",
    "note that the rise with @xmath37 in @xmath20 for @xmath38 is not accompanied by any change in @xmath32 .",
    "this unexpected phenomenon arises because at these colours the contribution of old metal - poor stars is increasing with @xmath37 , and because we see many of these stars near pericentre , they have small asymmetric drifts despite their large random velocities .    since at its bright end",
    "the hipparcos sample is close to being volume limited , the relative number of horizontal - branch stars is small and the complex structure above the main sequence in has no significant effect in .    in ,",
    "the squares show the resulting plot of the asymmetric drift @xmath32 against velocity dispersion squared for the synthetic samples of ; they do not lie on a straight line .",
    "the red dots show the plot one obtains if all stars are assigned solar metallicity .",
    "these dots _ do _ lie on a good approximation to a straight line .",
    "the effect of re - assigning stars with large guiding - centre radii from solar metallicity to their true , low metallicities is to move them from redder to bluer bins .",
    "since these stars have small or even negative values of @xmath32 on account of the metallicity gradient in the disc , the transfer reduces @xmath32 for the young , bluer bins and increases it in the old , redder bins .",
    "consequently , the transfer morphs the near - straight line of the red points into the curve defined by the green squares .",
    "db98 estimated @xmath1 by fitting a straight line to the observational analogue of , which is a plot of the solar velocity relative to a colour - selected group of stars versus the squared velocity dispersion of that group .",
    "the blue data points in show such data for the hipparcos sample in the re - analysis of @xcite after subtracting @xmath39 from each value of solar velocity .",
    "we see that for @xmath40 ^ 2 $ ] the hipparcos data define the same straight line as the green crosses from the model .",
    "this straight line intercepts the @xmath32 axis at @xmath41 rather than 0 , causing @xmath1 to be underestimated by this amount . for @xmath42",
    "^ 2 $ ] the hipparcos data points in deviate from this straight line , but db98 ignored samples with very low velocity dispersion on the grounds that such samples may not be in dynamical equilibrium . indeed , both dissolving star clusters and the non - axisymmetric gravitational potentials of spiral arms are liable to distort the kinematics of stellar samples with low random velocities such that equation  ( [ eq : strom ] ) does not hold .    the failure of the synthetic samples to follow a straight line in implies that the square bracket in the asymmetric drift relation  ( [ eq : strom ] ) does depend on colour : it varies by a factor @xmath43 in the colour range @xmath30 as demonstrated in . a significant contribution to",
    "the value of the bracket comes from the first derivative term , which is smallest for metal - poor populations because their densities @xmath19 decline more slowly outwards on account of the metallicity gradient in the disc .",
    "physically , including metal - poor , thin - disc stars decreases @xmath32 because such stars typically visit the solar neighbourhood at pericentre , where they have @xmath44 .",
    "in view of the argument just presented , that the classical procedure can not yield a reliable value of @xmath0 , we now estimate @xmath0 by fitting the observed distributions of heliocentric velocities to the velocity distribution of the sb09a model .",
    "that is , we seek the offset @xmath45 from the circular velocity at which the model velocity distributions provide the best match to the distribution of observed heliocentric velocities .",
    "b09 used an analogous procedure to argue that @xmath46 ; however , the model distributions he used were obtained from analytic distribution functions rather from a model of the galaxy s chemical evolution . by using velocity distributions that reflect much prior information about the chemodynamical history of the galaxy in place of simple analytic functions , we hope to achieve a closer fit to the observed velocity distributions and",
    "therefore determine the requisite offset @xmath45 with greater precision .    in the points with ( poisson )",
    "error bars are for a subsample of gcs stars for which @xcite give reliable metallicities ; thirty likely halo stars have been removed by requiring @xmath47>-1.2 $ ] .",
    "this criterion is slightly stricter than that used in sb09b for the determination of the in - plane dispersion parameter ( @xmath35 of a @xmath48 old local population ) , such that we now use a marginally smaller value , @xmath49 , while lowering the vertical dispersion parameter to @xmath50 .",
    "the curves in show the model distributions when offset by @xmath51  we used cubic splines to interpolate between individual data points provided by the model in the @xmath52 component and determined the offset by maximising the likelihood of the data given the model .",
    "we used only five parameters for all three distributions : the two dispersion parameters and the three components of solar motion , yet the fit is of good quality .",
    "the small fluctuations of the data around the model @xmath52 and to a lesser extent @xmath53 distributions are readily accounted for by the well known stellar moving groups @xcite , likely caused by the dynamical influence of the galactic bar and spiral structure @xcite .",
    "a significant advantage of determining @xmath0 from the entire sample , as in this section , rather than from subsamples as done in the past , is the robustness of the result to changes in the modelled metallicity gradient .",
    "in fact , eliminating the model s metallicity gradient changes @xmath1 by less than @xmath54 .",
    "one should note that the quoted errors on the components of @xmath0 are purely formal .",
    "sources of additional systematic error include the possible presence of halo stars in the sample , the dynamical approximations used in constructing the model , and the effects of stellar streams , which have a big impact on the observed distribution of stars near the circular velocity but are completely excluded from the model .",
    "fortunately the likelihood of the data used here is not particularly sensitive to the fit of the data to the model around the peak density . in view of these uncertainties",
    "we roughly estimate systematic errors of @xmath3 , assuming that @xmath53 and @xmath55 are mostly affected by distortions by streams and @xmath52 showing even more structure and having an additional uncertainty from the modelling .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with previous estimates as regards @xmath7 and slightly higher in @xmath6 compared to the db98 value , which can be traced back of the larger influence of the hercules stream at @xmath56 ( lowering the estimate ) on their statistics .",
    "however , it differs significantly from the value for @xmath57 obtained by the classical technique ( db98 , * ? ? ?",
    "our value for @xmath1 is in good agreement with @xmath46 proposed by b09 . given the residual uncertainties of @xmath0 , it is questionable whether the standard practice of `` correcting '' observed ( heliocentric ) velocities for the solar motion is useful , at least the adopted value should be explicitly provided .",
    "the metallicity gradient in the galactic disc causes a systematic shift in the kinematics especially near the turnoff region . by the relationship between the colour and metallicity of a star ,",
    "the more metal - rich populations , with on average lower angular momentum and thus higher asymmetric drifts , are displaced relative to their metal - poor counterparts , which have lower asymmetric drifts .",
    "when stars are binned by colour , the metallicity gradient in the galactic disc prevents the relationship between mean rotation speed and squared velocity dispersion taking the linear form predicted by a naive application of the strmberg relation .",
    "this breakdown in the conventionally assumed linearity invalidates the traditional technique for determining the sun s velocity with respect to the lsr , which involves a linear extrapolation to zero velocity dispersion of the empirical relation between the mean velocity and squared velocity dispersion .",
    "moreover the sb09a model predicts that a treacherous linear relationship underestimating the solar azimuthal motion by @xmath58 will be mimicked redwards of the onset of the turnoff region , coinciding well with the behaviour observed in the hipparcos data .",
    "the sun s velocity with respect to the lsr may be alternatively determined from the velocity offset that optimises a model fit to the observed velocity distribution . using the velocity distribution predicted by the sb09a model of the chemodynamical evolution of the galaxy , we find @xmath59 and",
    "roughly estimate the systematic uncertainties as @xmath3 .",
    "the radial and vertical components of this value of @xmath0 agree with earlier estimates , but the @xmath52 component is larger than the widely used value of db98 by @xmath60 .",
    "this is in nice concordance with the model expectations for the systematic error arising from naively using the strmberg relation and in good agreement with the value obtained by b09 using a similar method but with a less sophisticated distribution function .",
    "curiously it agrees well with the result @xmath61 obtained by @xcite using the classical method with pre - hipparcos data .    in this paper",
    "we have relied heavily on the sb09a model , so the question arises of how vulnerable our argument is to the model s shortcomings .",
    "our critique of the classical approach to the determination of @xmath0 is secure so long as the disc has significant age and/or metallicity gradients .",
    "it is beyond question that such gradients exist , so the classical technique is certainly unreliable .",
    "our proposed value of @xmath1 is essentially independent of the assumed metallicity gradient , but does have some sensitivity to the dynamical approximations used in making the sb09a model  plausible variations of how one handles the secular acceleration of stars lead to changes in the estimated value of @xmath1 by @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "modest reassurance that the error of our value of @xmath1 is less than @xmath64 is furnished by the fact that b09 favoured the same value using a distribution function that takes no account of the age and metallicity gradients in the disc .",
    "consequently , our result is probably not sensitive to the assumptions about star formation and chemical evolution made by sb09a .",
    "however , as we develop more elaborate models of the galaxy which fit a wider range of data , in particular more distant stars , we anticipate further small revisions in the value of @xmath1 .",
