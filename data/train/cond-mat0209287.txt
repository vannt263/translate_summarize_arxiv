    "the exploration of nonequilibrium universality classes is current interest of research . in this area most systems investigated exhibit phase transitions to absorbing states with such weak fluctuations from which no return is possible @xcite . for a long time only the robust directed percolation ( dp ) universality class has been known @xcite .",
    "later systems with extra conservation laws and symmetries were shown to belong to other universality classes @xcite . in the past few years it turned out that there are novel classes in low dimensional reaction - diffusion systems where neither classical bosonic field theory nor symmetry arguments can give better understanding of the critical behavior @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that in low dimensions topological constraints become effective , blocking the motion of reacting particles @xcite .",
    "while bosonic field theories can not capture this feature , fermionic field theories have not been successful for such systems so far .",
    "in fact the critical behavior of such models split according to fermionic or bosonic particles are involved in @xcite .",
    "recently novel universal behavior is reported in some low - dimensional reaction - diffusion models featured by production at pairs and single particle diffusion @xcite . in these systems",
    "the production compete with pair annihilation and diffusion .",
    "if production wins steady states with finite particle density appear in ( fermionic ) models with hard - core repulsion , while in unrestricted ( bosonic ) models the density diverges . by lowering the production / annihilation rate",
    "a doublet of absorbing states without symmetries emerges .",
    "one of such states is completely empty , the other possesses a single wandering particle . in case of fermionic systems the transition to absorbing states is continuous with novel , yet not completely settled critical behavior .",
    "the field theory @xcite describing bosonic particles could not be solved by standard renormalization procedures , but hinted at a transition with non - dp behavior . at the transition point of the 1d model it predicts a density decay of the form @xmath9^{1/2 } \\ , \\ ] ] while in the inactive phase : @xmath10 .",
    "these were confirmed by simulations @xcite . in case of fermionic particles of this model ( pcpd )",
    "density matrix renormalization group analysis @xcite , coherent anomaly extrapolation @xcite and simulations @xcite found novel kind of critical phase transition .",
    "however the critical exponents seem to depend on the diffusion strength @xmath2 and different interpretations of data have been born .",
    "these embrace the possibilities of continuously changing exponents , two - universality classes @xcite and single class with huge corrections @xcite .",
    "very recently well defined set of critical exponents are reported in different versions of binary production pcpd - like processes @xcite .",
    "however these simulations were done at a fixed , high diffusion / annihilation rate and as will be shown in sect .",
    "[ simu ] the exponent estimates agree well with those of this paper in the high diffusion region . even more recently two studies @xcite reported non - universality in the dynamical behavior of the pcpd .",
    "while the former one by dickman and menezes explored different sectors ( a reactive and a diffusive one ) in the time evolution and gave nontrivial exponent estimates , the latter one by hinrichsen provided a hypothesis that the ultimate long time behavior should be characterized by dp behavior .    just before the submission of this paper a preprint by kockelkoren and chat @xcite showed extensive simulation results for a modified version of pcpd that is in between fermionic and bosonic models .",
    "that means that they discard the single particle occupation constraint on the lattice but suppress multiple occupancy by an exponentially decreasing creation probability ( @xmath11 ) of the particle number .",
    "they claim that their stochastic cellular automaton ( sca ) model shows smaller corrections to scaling than the pcpd and exhibit a single universality class transition .",
    "the two universality class scenario was backed by pair mean - field approximation @xcite that showed two different mean - field behavior by varying @xmath2 and simulations @xcite for the order parameter density exponents .",
    "such kind of mean - field behavior is absent if we replace the annihilation @xmath12 with coagulation @xmath13 @xcite . by the investigation of the parity conserving version of the pcpd",
    "the mean - field and pair - mean - field approximations resulted in similar phase diagram , but higher order cluster mean - field showed a single mean - field class behavior @xcite and the authors concluded that the for appropriate description of such binary production models at least @xmath14 clusters are needed .",
    "that mean - field behavior was indeed found in @xmath15 by simulations @xcite .    in the present work",
    "i show @xmath1 cluster mean - field results for the pcpd model that again suggest single mean - field universality class .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that below @xmath16 only one class would exist .",
    "higher precision simulations than that of @xcite are also presented in the second part of this paper that provide better exponent estimates but still leave this question open .",
    "a single universality class scenario may be accepted only if we assume logarithmic correction to data .",
    "a pcpd like binary spreading process was introduced in an early work by grassberger @xcite .",
    "its preliminary simulations in 1d showed a non - dp type transition , but these results have been forgotten for a long time . the diffusive pair contact process ( pcpd ) introduced by carlon et al @xcite",
    "is controlled by two independent parameters : the probability of pair annihilation @xmath17 and the probability of particle diffusion @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamical rules are @xmath18 the _ site mean - field _ approximation gives a continuous transition at @xmath19 .",
    "for @xmath20 the particle and pair densities exhibit singular behavior : @xmath21 while at @xmath22 they decay as : @xmath23 with the exponents : @xmath24    according to _ pair mean - field _ approximations the phase diagram can be separated into two regions ( see fig.[pcpd_pd ] ) .",
    "while for @xmath25 the pair approximation gives the same @xmath26 and exponents as the site mean - field , for @xmath27-s the transition line breaks and the exponents are different @xmath28 in the entire inactive phase the decay is characterized by the exponents : @xmath29",
    "the generalized , _ cluster mean - field _ approximation introduced by @xcite was applied for the dynamical rules ( [ dynamicrules ] ) of the 1d fermionic lattice model .",
    "master equations for @xmath30 block probabilities were set up @xmath31 where site variables may take values : @xmath32 .",
    "the equations could be solved numerically for the @xmath33 steady state condition .",
    "taking into account spatial reflection symmetries of @xmath34 this involves 10 independent variables in case of @xmath35 .",
    "the particle ( @xmath36 ) and pair ( @xmath37 ) densities were expressed by @xmath34 and the phase transition point @xmath26 was located for several values of @xmath2 . at @xmath26 quadratic fitting of the form @xmath38",
    "was applied for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath39 and @xmath40 solutions reproduced the results of @xcite for particle and pair densities . for @xmath4 the two regions , corresponding to different leading order singularity of @xmath37 with @xmath41 were located by least square fit with the form ( [ fit ] ) . for @xmath1 approximations",
    "smooth @xmath42 phase transition lines are determined shown on fig.[pcpd_pd ] and tabulated in table [ gmft ] .",
    "the quadratic fitting ( [ fit ] ) resulted in leading order singularities @xmath43 for particles and @xmath3 for pairs everywhere .",
    "these are in contradiction with the @xmath4 approximation results similarly to the parity conserving binary process model case @xcite . for",
    "that model simulations in 2d strengthened the single mean - field class behavior along @xmath26 and it was conjectured that the pair approximation is an odd one . here again i conclude that at least @xmath44 level of approximation is necessary to obtain a correct mean - field behavior .    the single mean - field class property does not necessarily mean that below @xmath45 a single class behavior should occur all along the @xmath26 transition line .",
    "for example in a similar model that exhibits an additional global particle number conservation @xcite such situation was found .",
    "therefore i investigated by extensive simulations this question .",
    "the simulations were performed on @xmath5 sized rings with random sequential update version of pcpd evolving by the following rules .",
    "a particle and a direction are selected randomly .",
    "one of the following reaction is performed : ( a ) a nearest neighbour exchange in the selected direction with probability @xmath2 ; ( b ) an annihilation with the nearest neighbour particle in the selected direction with probability @xmath46 ; ( c ) a creation of a new particle in the selected direction at the second nearest neighbour empty site with probability @xmath47 if the nearest neighbour is filled with a particle .",
    "the number of particles ( @xmath48 ) is followed and the time is updated by @xmath49 following a reaction ( throughout the whole paper the time is measured by monte carlo steps ( mcs ) ) .",
    "the initial conditions were random distribution of particles with occupation probability @xmath50 .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that one may get smaller corrections to scaling if one excludes the purely diffusive sector by averaging for states having at least one pair in the system . in the present simulations i did not find much effect ( within statistical error margin ) of such restrictions for the long time behavior .",
    "[ dec1 ] , [ dec05 ] .      the critical point ( @xmath51 ) for diffusion rates @xmath52",
    ", @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath50 , @xmath55 has been located by following the time evolution of the density decay .",
    "these simulations were done in two parts . first runs up to @xmath56 mcs and with high statistical averages ( @xmath57 ) were performed that allowed local slopes estimates of the density ( @xmath58 ) decay exponent @xmath59 and @xmath51 .",
    "these simulations were extended by long time runs up to @xmath60 mcs with @xmath61 sample numbers .",
    "the two sets of data are fitted together and are shown on figs .",
    "[ dec7 ] , [ dec5 ] , [ dec2 ] ,    on all plots one can see up and down veering @xmath58 curves in the long time limit  corresponding to active and absorbing phases  separated by a roughly straight line  corresponding to @xmath51 .",
    "as one can see for high diffusion rates ( @xmath62 ) scaling with exponent @xmath63 seems to a set for @xmath64 mcs .",
    "this is in agreement with the first results provided for pcpd for high diffusion rates @xcite and with the results of @xcite for strong diffusions .    in cases @xmath52 and @xmath53 straight lines on the log - log plot appear from @xmath65 mcs with an exponent @xmath66 .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of @xcite who considered the case when the coagulation and annihilation rate is three times the diffusion rate .",
    "this exponent is about 10% smaller than what was found in @xcite but the two distinct class behavior seems to be supported .",
    "although the upper critical dimension of pcpd is expected to be at @xmath16 @xcite one may not exclude the possibility of a second critical dimension ( @xmath67 ) or topological effects in 1d that may cause logarithmic corrections to scaling .",
    "for this reason i tried to apply logarithmic fitting to the data of the form @xmath68^{\\alpha } \\ \\ .\\ ] ] one can find the corresponding exponents in table [ simtab ] that are all in agreement with the value @xmath7 in both the low and high diffusion regions . here",
    "i applied least squares fitting for the most critical like curves such that the relative error in the sum of squares was at most 0.0001 . to confirm these results other critical exponents",
    "were investigated using the precise @xmath51 values of this section .      to estimate directly the order parameter exponent describing the scaling @xmath69 off - critical , steady state densities had to be measured .",
    "here again i used @xmath5 system sizes .",
    "the density decay was followed for each @xmath2 and @xmath70 values on logarithmic time scales until saturation effect was observed . following that averaging of @xmath58 was done for about @xmath71 samples within a time window that exceeds the saturation by a decade .",
    "i measured the effective exponents like in @xcite defined as @xmath72 that are expected to converge to the true critical values in the @xmath73 limit .",
    "as one can see on fig.[betaa ] the local slopes for @xmath74 and @xmath75 converge to @xmath76 in agreement with the high diffusion rate results provided in @xcite .",
    "this value is also close to hinrichsen s estimate ( @xmath77 ) for the cyclically coupled model @xcite and to kockelkoren s value ( @xmath78 ) for the suppressed bosonic sca model @xcite .",
    "however for @xmath52 and @xmath79 extrapolations suggest @xmath80 .",
    "this is in agreement with park s recent the results ( @xmath81 ) @xcite but somewhat off the low - diffusion data of ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath82 ) and from dickman s estimates ( @xmath83 ) @xcite .",
    "the reason for these deviations is likely to be related to strong finite size effects , the complex way of scaling and the uncertainties of the @xmath51 values used .    in case of the @xmath84 curve",
    "one may observe an extrapolation to some intermediate value , but the curvature of the last points may also suggest a tendency towards the high @xmath2 class data .",
    "note that in earlier , lower scale simulations @xcite the data for @xmath84 showed low-@xmath2 critical behavior , strengthening the idea that some kind of very slow crossover happens here ( although those results were obtained for a sca version of pcpd ) .",
    "similarly to dynamical simulations i tried the possibility if logarithmic correction to scaling @xmath85^{\\beta }   \\label{logcor}\\ ] ] could cure these `` uncertainties '' . as one can see in table [ simtab ] the exponents for all @xmath2 values satisfy scaling with @xmath76 with logarithmic corrections of the form ( [ logcor ] ) .",
    "finite size scaling at the critical point was performed for system sizes @xmath86 . the quasi - steady state density ( averaged over surviving samples )",
    "is expected to scale according to @xmath87 while the characteristic lifetime for half of the samples to reach the absorbing state scales with the dynamical exponent @xmath88 as @xmath89 since the system sizes are much smaller than in sects .",
    "[ denss ] and [ sts ] one may expect stronger corrections to scaling .",
    "indeed the power - law fitting for @xmath90 results in values in the range @xmath91 and for @xmath88 in the range @xmath92 depending on @xmath2 .",
    "these results are shown of fig.[fssz ] . again",
    "the low-@xmath2 data are in agreement with those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , while the high-@xmath2 data with those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . just considering these ranges one can not distinguish this transition from the pc class ( with @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xcite ) that caused initial debates in the literature @xcite . assuming single universality class corresponding to high-@xmath2 data we may expect : @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "in this paper i addressed the long standing question of diffusion dependence of the phase transition of the pcpd model .",
    "the @xmath1 level cluster mean - field calculations confirmed a single mean - field universality class scenario similarly to the parity conserving version of this model @xcite . again",
    "the best conclusion one can draw from these data is that the @xmath4 pair approximation is an odd one and we need at least @xmath44 level of mean - filed to get the correct scaling behavior for binary production models .",
    "the extensive simulations have confirmed at least one set of the exponents  those for high diffusion of the early results given in @xcite .",
    "data in the low diffusion range are in good agreement with other recent simulation results suggesting a different universality class .",
    "although the scaling seems to set in much earlier in the low diffusion region than in the high diffusion range , a slow crossover to high-@xmath2 behavior can be verified numerically assuming logarithmic corrections .",
    "similar conclusions can also be drawn from steady state simulation results .",
    "although the two universality class picture proposed in @xcite can not be excluded , data with logarithmic corrections may support a single class transition .",
    "field theoretical arguments supporting or excluding logarithmic corrections would be necessary .",
    "note that in 1d coupled systems logarithmic corrections are not rare at all .",
    "the finite size simulations could not give decisive support for any of the the possible dependence on diffusion of this transition , but the range of results are in agreement with those of other numerical results of the literature .",
    "mean - filed exponents , the upper critical dimension and the lack of time reversal symmetry in this model seem to exclude the possibility of further crossovers to an ultimate dp critical behavior .",
    "finally the insensitivity to parity conservation in binary production models brings up the question of insensitivity for other conservation laws , hence binary production , diffusive models with global conservation might belong to the same class .",
