    "<S> one band overlaps the fermi level providing the metallic state where no strong electron correlations are revealed by korringa analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the other band is separated from the fermi level by an energy gap of @xmath6 @xmath7 67 k , which gives rise to the semiconductor - like properties . </S>",
    "<S> first principle calculation revealed that the metallic band originates from the ge vacancy while the semiconductor - like band may be related to the fine structure of the density of states near the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> low temperature @xmath0te nmr data for the materials studied here clearly show that the ag substitution increases hole concentration while sb substitution decreases it . </S>"
