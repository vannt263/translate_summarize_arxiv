    "the co[2 - 1 ] luminosities derived from iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) observations of two sources  @xmath8 and @xmath1 at @xmath9 and @xmath2 respectively  imply star - formation efficiencies ( sfes ) similar to those of local spirals , an order of magnitude lower than those in submillimeter selected sources .",
    "the low sfes suggest that these objects behave as scaled - up versions of local spirals , with long lasting , low - efficiency star - formation .",
    "given the disk - like uv rest - frame morphology of these objects in deep hst+acs imaging , and the good agreement between the uv and radio / mid - ir star formation rates , d08 suggested that star formation in these galaxies is taking place in disk - wide extended gas reservoirs .",
    "this is contrary to major merger - triggered nuclear starbursts as seen in local ulirgs and distant smgs , despite the fact that the sfrs and star formation surface densities in these objects are similar to those of local starbursts and ulirgs . given that both galaxies observed in co by d08 were detected with large co luminosities , and that the space density of similar sources is 1030@xmath10 larger than that of smgs ( daddi et al .",
    "2007 ) , this suggests that such a quiescent gas - consumption activity could be a prevalent mode of star - formation and galaxy growth in the distant universe .    in order to gain insights on the physical properties of the molecular gas and",

    "despite many co observations at high redshift , no evidence for milky - way - like co excitation has been found so far .",
    "this result may be biased by the pre - selection of the most ir - luminous galaxies for study , and by the prevalence of high frequency , high - j transition observations .    here",

    "we reduced and calibrated the data with the gildas software packages clic and map . the final data , imaged using natural weighting , have a noise of 0.11  mjy integrated over the full 1  ghz bandwidth .",
    "in addition to the co[2 - 1 ] dataset already presented by d08 , we also use co[2 - 1 ] observations of both bzk galaxies obtained with iram pdbi in b - configuration ( synthesized beam @xmath15 ) that have been already presented in daddi et al .",

    "taken at face value , this implies that we are seeing excess peak emission in co[1 - 0 ] relative to what is expected from co[2 - 1 ] although the evidence for an excess is very mild given the low s / n in the co[1 - 0 ] data .",
    "higher s / n observations would be needed to establish if the co[2 - 1 ] transition is sub - thermally excited with respect to co[1 - 0 ] .",
    "for @xmath1 , the co[3 - 2 ] and [ 2 - 1 ] fluxes are comparable within the errors .",
    "the co spectral line energy distribution of @xmath1 is consistent with the milky - way disk measurements by @xcite ( fig .",

    "the co sled of @xmath1 is in stark contrast to what has been generally seen so far in high - redshift sources like qsos and smgs , for which gas has been found to be thermalized up to at least the @xmath11 transition @xcite . a possible exception is the extremely red galaxy hr  10 at @xmath43 according to the results of @xcite and @xcite who find comparable fluxes of co[5 - 4 ] and co[2 - 1 ] .",
    "however we note that the excitation in our sources is still lower than that in hr10 .",
    "we now discuss the implication of our excitation measurements on the physical properties of the gas , including the kinetic temperature ( @xmath44 ) and density ( @xmath45 ) of the h@xmath5 gas in the molecular clouds , by using large velocity gradient ( lvg ) modeling @xcite .",
    "we use the collision rates from @xcite with a fixed co abundance to velocity gradient ratio of [ co]/(dv / dr)@xmath46 @xcite , an h@xmath5 ortho : para ratio of 3:1 and the cosmic background temperature at @xmath2 of 6.89  k   transition the cosmic background radiation at @xmath47 will have only a minor effect on the depopulation of the state of our two sources .",
    "the reason is that the intrinsic temperature in the molecular clouds is expected to be higher , e.g. the intrinsic temperature within the milky - way clouds is at least greater than 10  k and most likely lies around @xmath48k . ] . due to the limited amount of information available",
    ", we will not be able to resolve the ambiguity between all the free parameters .",
    "e.g. , choosing a different value of [ co]/(dv / dr ) would also affect the sled , and would require re - adjusting @xmath44 and/or @xmath45 to reproduce observed ratios ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a more detailed discussion of the parameter space degeneracies ) .",
    "we present here three representative models , spanning the range of parameter degeneracies in @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( see fig .",

    "the filling factor of clouds , assuming a disk radius @xmath52  kpc from our acs observations ( d08 ) , is 2% for this model .",
    "model  2 can still fit the data assuming @xmath53  k and @xmath54  @xmath51 with a similar filling factor to model  1 .",
    "model  3 results in a higher filling factor of 8% with a low @xmath55  k but a higher @xmath56  @xmath51 .",
    "typical gas / dust temperatures in nearby spirals / starbursts are 1030 k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sometimes up to 40 - 50 k in the central regions of nuclear starbursts @xcite . normal galactic giant molecular clouds have typical average densities of @xmath57  @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "these values are broadly similar to what is allowed from lvg modeling of our observations .",
    "clearly , we can rule out solutions where the gas is at high density and/or temperature , similar to what is generally found inside local ulirgs , distant smgs and qsos .    despite the degeneracies in the inferred physical parameters ,",
    "the lvg models presented above consistently predict @xmath58 , higher than our average estimate for the bzk galaxies but consistent within the uncertainties . robustly confirming an excess co[1 - 0 ] emission over what is predicted by the lvg models shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cosed ] would imply the discovery of very cold molecular gas unseen even in the co[2 - 1 ] transition . for the moment ,",
    "given our limited s / n at the measured @xmath59 , we assume that @xmath58 and @xmath60 are the typical values for our sources .",
    "this implies that the co luminosities derived for our galaxies in d08 from co[2 - 1 ] do not need substantial revisions , exception made for the small 16% increase required when converting co[2 - 1 ] to co[1 - 0 ] , as suggested by our lvg modeling .",
    "however , our results strongly indicate that when using transitions higher than co[2 - 1 ] only a fraction of the co[1 - 0 ] luminosity is recovered ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cosed ] , right ) , implying that such measurements are not reliable for accurately estimating the total gas mass and star formation efficiencies in bzk - like galaxies .",
    "this evidence could explain the discrepancy between the observations of hatsukade et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and tacconi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) who failed to detect co[3 - 2 ] in 4 optically and uv selected galaxies at @xmath61 , while so far we have a high detection rate in co[2 - 1 ] at redshift @xmath0 .",
    "a large correction factor of 2.4 is required , in fact , at co[3 - 2 ] in order to recover the total molecular gas mass , based on our results from @xmath1 .",
    "given that these two high redshift galaxies have star - formation efficiencies and co excitation properties similar to those in local spirals and in the milky way , it is plausible that they may also have a milky - way - like molecular conversion factor @xmath62 as well .",
    "this would imply molecular gas reservoirs of @xmath63 and gas mass fractions @xmath64 . to summarize , our sources provide clear examples of the long - sought after population of low - excitation co emitters at high - z .",
    "observations of a larger sample of near - ir selected galaxies are required in order to confirm our results in a statistical way .",
    "in particular , high s / n observations of co[1 - 0 ] and high - j co are required to search for additional components of colder and warmer gas , respectively .",
    "much higher s / n data will also be required to search for excitation variations inside the disks , as tentatively suggested by our data and as could be expected in the case of very clumpy gas distribution ( e.g. , bournaud et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
