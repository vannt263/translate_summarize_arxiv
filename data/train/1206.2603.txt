    "the hysteresis at each of the transitions evidences dissipation resulting in the unavoidable generation of heat during the experiments .",
    "this irreversible heating is likely partially compensated by cooling due to the magnetocaloric effect , which in turn is caused by the field - induced closing of the spin gap .",

    "owing to the rapid succession of the two transitions on the rising magnetic field where the rate of change of magnetic field is highest , not all of the heat generated by the first transition is able to escape the sample before the second transition , possibly contributing to the temperature - rounding of the second transition on the rising magnetic field",
    ". the slower ramp rate of the falling magnetic field enables more heat to dissipate to the cryogen between the transitions , enabling both transitions to be clearly observed with reduced rounding .",
