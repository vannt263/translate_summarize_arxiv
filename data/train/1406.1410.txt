    "although the standard model of elementary particles(sm ) describes the high energy phenomena very well , particle physicists have been attracted by the physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "there are very good reasons about this ;    1 .",
    "the sm higgs sector is not natural .",
    "2 .   there is no dark matter candidate in the sm .",
    "origin of three gauge interactions is not understood in the sm .",
    "cosmological observations suggest an inflation period in the early universe .",
    "the non - zero baryon number of our universe is not consistent with the inflation picture unless a new interaction is introduced .",
    "the higgs boson candidate was discovered recently .",
    "the study of the higgs boson nature is extremely important for the bsm study .",
    "the higgs boson is a spin 0 particle , and the structure of the radiative correction is quite different from those of fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "the correction of the higgs boson mass is proportional to the cut - off scale , called",
    " quadratic divergence \" .",
    "if the cut - off scale is high , the correction becomes unacceptably large compared with the on - shell mass of the higgs boson .",
    "this is often called a  fine turning problem \" .",
    "note that such quadratic divergence does not appear in the radiative correction to the fermion and gauge boson masses .",
    "they are protected by the chiral and gauge symmetries , respectively .",
    "the problem can be solved if there are an intermediate scale where new particles appears , and the radiative correction from the new particles compensates the sm radiative correction .",
    "the scale is probably much less than @xmath0(100 )  tev , where the ratio between the sm radiative correction and the higgs vev is more than 1000 .",
    "the turning of the factor 1000 may sound unnatural , but it is much better than the scale among other parameters , such as planck scale to the order of electroweak symmetry breaking , or the large difference among yukawa couplings .    an idea to introduce a new particle that couples to the higgs boson to cancel one loop level quadratic correction , is not successful , because such accidental cancellation does not hold all order in the perturbation theory .",
    "one needs new symmetry to cancel the quadratic divergence in the sm by a new physics contribution .",
    "the known ideas to achieve the reduction of quadratic divergence are the following ;    1 .",
    "* supersymmetry * : extend the sm so that the theory has ",
    "supersymmetry `` .",
    "supersymmetry is the symmetry between bosons and fermions , which allows the divergence of higgs boson mass controlled by ' ' chiral symmetry \" of fermions . due to the cancellation among various diagrams involving sm particles and their superpartners ( susy particles ) , there are no quadratic divergence to the higgs bosons mass in this theory .",
    "* dynamical symmetry breaking * : in this theory , a new strong interaction causes the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking of the sm .",
    "the higgs doublet is a nambu - goldstone boson of the symmetry breaking and bound states of fermions charged under the strong interaction , corresponding to the pions in the qcd .",
    "the higgs boson does not exist above the symmetry breaking scale , so there are no problem of quadratic divergence .",
    "* extra dimension * although we recognize that we live in the four dimensional space - time , we might live in more than the five dimension space time where the extra dimensions are compactified",
    ". the true planck scale may be much closer to electroweak scale in such a theory , or the fundamental parameters in the higgs sector is of the order of planck scale in the higher dimensional theory but looks small in the effective four dimensional theory . in some class of the model",
    "the higgs boson may be a part of gauge boson in the 5th dimension so that the divergence of the higgs mass parameters is controlled by the gauge symmetry .",
    "those models are constrained strongly by precision measurements .",
    "currently there are no measurements with significant deviation from the sm predictions . in the sm theory",
    ", one can predict various observables from a few fundamental parameters : the gauge couplings @xmath1 , and the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath2 . by measuring the deviations from the sm predictions , we can set constrains on the new physics .",
    "especially , the @xmath3 and @xmath4 parameters which parametrize the new physics contributions to the gauge two point functions are sensitive to all particles that couple to the gauge bosons .",
    "measurements of flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) constrain the existence of flavor off - diagonal interactions .",
    "very precisely measured parameters sometimes exhibit significant deviations from the sm predictions . currently muon",
    "anomalous magnetic moment deviates from the sm prediction by more than 3 @xmath5 .",
    "it is sensitive to the new physics that couples to muon .",
    "the quadratic divergence of the higgs sector exists if the divergence is estimated by the momentum cut off @xmath6 , the upper bound of the various loop integral appearing in the radiative correction in the mass .",
    "we have to keep it in mind that the quadratic divergence does not depend on the external momentum , therefore it is a regularization dependent object . especially in",
    "dimensional regularization , quadratic divergence is trivially zero . then , is there any reason that we should take the fine turning problem seriously ?    the fine turning argument based on momentum cut - off is justified in the case that the theory has large symmetry at some higher energy scale .",
    "for example , in the supersymmetric model , the regularization must respect to supersymmetry and one can not subtract all quadratic divergence . to this end , the higgs sector receives radiative corrections proportional to the susy scale ( superpartner mass scale ) under correct regularization . in the limit that superpartners are much heavier than sm particles ,",
    "the low energy theory looks like the sm with the momentum cutoff at the susy scale .",
    "fine turning arguments hold for the theories with an intermediated scale above which a new symmetry emerges .",
    "there is another indication of the existence of new physics between the weak scale and the planck scale .",
    "we may consider the higgs potential at large field value in the sm and study the stability .",
    "the potential is a function of the top and higgs masses , and current top and higgs mass measurements favor metastable higgs potential .",
    "there is not any reason that the higgs vev should fall in such a metastable point , and this also suggests that additional particles that couple to the higgs sector change the shape of the potential .",
    "another strong indication of new physics is the existence of dark matter in our universe .",
    "global fit of the cosmological observation favors the existence of stable , neutral particle , dark matter , which accounts for 27% of the total energy of our universe .",
    "the existence of the dark matter is also confirmed by various observations of the stellar objects .",
    "rotation curve of the stars of the galaxy indicates that galaxies are dominated by the non - luminous component .",
    "the is also a technique to measure the matters extended beyond the galaxy scale using gravitational lensing .",
    "our universe is @xmath7 years old , roughly @xmath8  s @xmath9",
    "@xmath10 gev@xmath11 .",
    "the dark matter life time must be at least of the oder of the age of the universe to remain in the current universe .",
    "on the other hand , a particle with mass @xmath12  ( gev ) with interaction suppressed by @xmath13 has a decay width of order of @xmath14 gev .",
    "namely the lifetime , @xmath15 , would be much shorter than the life of our universe ( @xmath16 s ) , where @xmath17 is the coupling of the decay vertex . to account for the lifetime of the dark matter in our universe",
    ", its decay must be very strongly suppressed , or forbidden .    for the case of the sm particles ,",
    "existence of stable particles is ensured by the symmetry .",
    "electron is the lightest charged particle and electronic charge is conserved by the gauge symmetry .",
    "proton is the lightest bound state of quarks .",
    "there are no interaction to break proton in the sm , because number of quark is conserved for interaction with the gauge bosons or the higgs boson , and direct interaction with electron is forbidden by the gauge symmetry .",
    "it is possible to conserve the baryon number 1/3 to the quarks in the sm , and this reflects the fact that proton is stable . to consider the particle model involving the stable ( or long - lived ) dark matter",
    ", we must introduce new symmetry to protect the dark matter from decaying .",
    "another puzzle of the sm is the hyper - charge assignments of the fermions . in the first glance ,",
    "it is not easy to find the rules to assign the charge to the sm matters .",
    "but , it fits very nicely to the representation of a @xmath18 group , where @xmath19 generators are embedded as @xmath20 here , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the @xmath23 and @xmath24 generators , * 1*@xmath25 and * 1*@xmath26 are @xmath27 or @xmath28 unit matrix , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 satisfy the commutation relations of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath32 generators . under this generator assignment ,",

    ", the sm three gauge couplings must unify at the short distance , so that the @xmath18 symmetry is recovered above that scale .",

    "two spin 0 states and two spin @xmath44 states are obtained .",
    "these states form a susy multiplet , and the spin @xmath58 states are the superpartners of the spin @xmath44 states and vise versa .",
    "because this multiplet contains spin 1/2 states , we can regard this as a matter multiplet .",
    "starting from a spin 1/2 state annihilating @xmath59 one gets two spin @xmath44 fermion states , a spin @xmath60 massive bosonic states and a spin @xmath58 bosonic state , namely 4 fermion degrees of freedom and 4 bosonic degrees of freedom .",

    "the signal contains @xmath192 and existence of two @xmath196 s is observed by the missing transverse momentum of the events , namely , the signal is similar to that of superpartner pair production .",
    "the signal production cross section is @xmath197(1 )  pb , while the @xmath192 production cross section is huge at the lhc , around 800  pb . if the distribution overlaps significantly , the signal is very difficult to be observed .",
    "however , the signal @xmath198 distribution peaks around 1  tev and missing momentum as close as half of the @xmath199 , while the background peaks around @xmath200 gev and @xmath201 .",
    "because of this distribution differences , the @xmath194 signature with the production cross section much less than 1  pb may be observed at the lhc .",
    "so far we have been talking about `` inclusive '' quantity .",
    "they are defined using all objects in an event .",
    "we may also select jets or leptons with special features and use kinematical information to separate signals and backgrounds .",
    "let us consider events with one lepton and some missing momentum .",
    "the event with one lepton + multiple jets + missing momentum is an important signature of superpartner production .",
    "however , events involving @xmath138 boson also produce such signatures .",
    "however , the events with @xmath138 boson can be reduced significantly if we require that @xmath202 of a lepton and missing @xmath179 is above 100  gev where @xmath202 is defined as @xmath203 the cut significantly reduces the background from the @xmath138 boson production to the susy process .",
    "the current bound of the susy process is obtained after successful reduction of background using the above kinematical variable .",
    "the understanding of background distribution is quite important , especially the cross section of @xmath138,@xmath204 , @xmath192 with multiple jets must be correctly calculated .",
    "the techniques to obtain multiple jets amplitudes with parton shower has been established only this century , and current susy searches at the lhc is benefitted by those techniques greatly .",
    "the current limit typically excludes squark with mass 1.8  tev and gluino with mass less than 1.4  tev , if the mass splitting between the lsp and colored susy particles are large enough .",
    "see fig .",
    "refsusylimit for the latest limits .",
    "supersymmetry is not a unique solution of the hierarchy problem",
    ". another important class of solutions is dynamical symmetry breaking models .",
    "when a global symmetry is broken spontaneously , a massless scalar modes ( nambu - goldstone boson ) appears , even if the theory does not have an elementary higgs boson .",
    "an important example is chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "the qcd lagrangian has @xmath205 symmetry when quark masses are ignored .",
    "the symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath206 dynamically , and the goldstone boson of the symmetry breaking are pions @xmath207 , and @xmath208 has non - zero vev .",
    "the pion has the same charge as the goldstone boson in the higgs sector .",
    "therefore , it is natural to consider scale up of the mechanism .",
    "the model involves a set of new quarks @xmath43 with ew charges , but couple to different asymptotic free gauge interactions whose couplings blow up at the scale of ew symmetry breaking .",
    "if @xmath209 condense , the light @xmath210 states work as the goldstone bosons of the ew symmetry breaking .",
    "this class of the model called technicolor model .",
    "the model has no quadratic divergence because the massless bound states only appear in the low energy effective theory .",
    "this is an interesting and beautiful idea , but is not consistent with precision ew observations . at lep ,",
    "gauge boson two point functions were precisely measured .",
    "especially the parameter called @xmath3 , receives non decoupling contribution from @xmath24 doublets @xmath43 which is colored in the new strong interactions , and also necessary charged under @xmath211 symmetry in the sm to break the gauge symmetry .",
    "their contribution appears constructively to the gauge two point functions , and therefore the model is tightly constrained .",
    "in addition , these models tend to predict a heavy higgs boson inconsistent with the data .",
    "another class of models called `` composite higgs models '' allows a higgs boson which is light but non - elementary . in these models ,",
    "the higgs doublet itself is a pseudo goldstone boson of some dynamical symmetry breaking . though the mechanism of dynamical symmetry breaking is not specified , the smallness of the mass of the higgs boson is thought to be ensured by the global symmetry of the theory .",
    "the model requires extension of the top sector because the top yukawa coupling violates the desired global symmetry strongly .",
    "the extended top sector is a target of extensive atlas and cms searches .",
    "in the extra dimension models the space has more than three dimensions but the additional space dimension is compactified with a small size @xmath155 so that we could not recognized it easily . when the extra dimension is flat",
    ", the fields in the extra dimension may satisfy the periodic boundary condition such as @xmath212 where @xmath94 represents four dimensional space time , while @xmath100 is the fifth dimension . under this boundary condition ,",
    "the wave function is expressed as @xmath213 where @xmath214 ( @xmath215 is an integer ) .",
    "this leads to an equation of motion of a free particle propagating in the the fifth dimension , @xmath216 namely , the model predicts an infinite tower of particles of the four dimensional effective theory , which corresponds to different values of the discrete momenta in the fifth direction .    the coupling of the fifth dimension related with the couplings in the four dimensional effective theory in non - trivial manner .",
    "a simple example is the gauge coupling of the fifth dimensional theory and the four dimensional effective theory , @xmath217 where @xmath218 .",
    "larger the size of the fifth dimension is , @xmath219 becomes small .",
    "this is also true for gravitational interactions .",
    "the four dimensional gravitational interaction may be small because the size of extra dimension is large .",
    "the large extra dimension model tried to solve the fine tuning problem by making true phanck scale in the higher dimensional theory much smaller than the @xmath220 .",
    "the extra dimension may not be flat . in the rs model",
    ", the fifth dimension has non - trivial metric as follows : @xmath221 where @xmath222 and @xmath223 is the boundary of the fifth dimension .",
    "the gravity action in the bulk is expressed as @xmath224 when the @xmath225 is expressed as @xmath226 provided appropriate fine tuning of the boundary actions .",
    "the geometry allows us to control the masses of sm particles .",
    "if the higgs boson is at @xmath227 boundary ( which is called visible brane ) , the kinetic term is expressed as @xmath228 the mass term receives the suppression factor of @xmath229 after rescaling the higgs field so that they have canonical kinetic terms . by adjusting parameters one",
    "can easily obtain the mass of the sm particle of the oder of the ew scale while all parameters of the fundamental fifth dimensional lagrangian are of the order of @xmath220 without fine turning .",
    "the model predicts towers of kk particles with mass of the order of @xmath230 for the particles living in the fifth dimension(bulk ) . a popular set up of the model is that all the sm fermions are the zero mode of the particles living in the bulk , and the higgs boson lives in the ir brane .",
    "mass term of the fifth dimensional lagrangian of the sm model matters control the profile of the fields in the bulk .",
    "one can adjust the mass so that light ( heavy ) quarks and lepton have small ( large ) overlap with the ir brane so that yukawa couplings in the four dimensional effective lagrangian is realized without introducing too much hierarchy among the interactions between the higgs boson and the bulk fermions .",
    "there are on - going search of the kk gauge bosons and kk fermions at the lhc , however , fcnc constraints require @xmath231  tev already , and it is unlikely that these new particles will be found at the lhc .",
