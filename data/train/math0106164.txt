    "we recall that there are a lot of ways of describing a 3-manifold : by fundamental polyhedra @xcite , by heegaard diagrams @xcite , by surgery on links in @xmath0 @xcite , by branched coverings of @xmath0 @xcite and by gems / crystallizations @xcite .",

    "as an example , we will describe the different faces of the classical hantzsche ",
    "wendt manifold @xcite .",
