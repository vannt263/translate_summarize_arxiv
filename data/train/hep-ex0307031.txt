    "radiative @xmath6 meson decays through the @xmath1 process have been a powerful tool to constrain physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the radiated photon serves as a probe to study short distance loop diagrams through a comparison of the decay rate with theory calculations and through a search for direct cp asymmetry .",
    "in addition , the radiated photon also probes the kinematical property of @xmath6 decays through the photon energy spectrum , which is useful to constrain the lepton spectrum in @xmath7 measurements .    a similar process , @xmath0 @xmath8 , acts as an additional probe for new physics , since the existence of the @xmath9-boson radiation and @xmath10-boson box diagrams may enhance the effects from new physics .",
    "the rate is about two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath1 , but the signal with two energetic leptons is very clean .",
    "the lepton pair in the final state provides two additional observables that can be used to identify new physics effects : the differential branching fraction and the lepton forward - backward asymmetry , as functions of the dilepton mass .",
    "recently belle observed the first @xmath11 events , and successfully measured the inclusive branching fraction for @xmath3 .",
    "another process , @xmath2 , is also suppressed by two orders of magnitude with respect to @xmath1 , naively due to the ckm factor @xmath12 .",
    "although the rate is similar to @xmath0 , the signal is less clean due to huge backgrounds of @xmath1 and energetic @xmath13 from the continuum @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) production . assuming that the non - sm contributions to @xmath1 and @xmath2 are small",
    ", we can constrain the value of @xmath12 from a @xmath2 measurement .",
    "it is very important to compare the @xmath16 value from @xmath2 with those from the @xmath17-@xmath18 mixing , since the latter involves lattice qcd calculations and may be affected by new physics that appear only in the mixing diagram .    in this report ,",
    "we summarize the latest belle results on the electroweak and radiative @xmath6 decays , and discuss the future prospects .",
    "we anticipate that a large dataset of @xmath19 will be ready within the next two to three years of kekb / belle operation .",
    "after the first observation of the decay @xmath11 @xcite by belle with a @xmath20 dataset , we extended our study to perform an inclusive measurement of @xmath3 , where @xmath21 is the hadron recoil system in the @xmath0 process @xcite .",
    "we adopt a pseudo - reconstruction technique , in which the @xmath22 system is reconstructed as a sum of one kaon ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) and zero to four pions ( of which up to one @xmath25 is allowed ) . assuming the decay rate to the state with a @xmath26 is the same as the rate with a @xmath24",
    ", this set of combinations covers @xmath27 of the signal .",
    "in addition , we do not use about 5% of the events with @xmath28 where the background rate is large .",
    "the @xmath22 system is combined with a pair of electrons @xmath29 or muons @xmath30 to form a beam - energy constrained mass ( @xmath31 ) to identify the signal .",
    "the electron pairs with @xmath32 are rejected to avoid the pole at @xmath33 and to reduce backgrounds from photon conversions and @xmath34 decays .",
    "the major background source is semileptonic @xmath6 decays , in which two leptons are either from two @xmath6 mesons or from the subsequent charm decays .",
    "the continuum background contribution is smaller than semileptonic @xmath6 decays .",
    "these backgrounds do not produce signal peaks , and can be separated from the signal by fitting @xmath31 . in addition , there are peaking backgrounds from @xmath35 ( mostly from @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) . the huge @xmath35 background becomes a contribution of @xmath40 events under the signal peak after the lepton identification requirements .",
    "the dilepton mass range around the @xmath41 and @xmath42 mass peaks are vetoed .",
    "the peaking backgrounds are useful control samples to evaluate various systematic errors in the analysis .    using a data sample of @xmath43",
    ", we observed about 60 events in the @xmath31 distribution with an efficiency of @xmath44 and a statistical significance of 5.4 .",
    "we obtained the inclusive branching fraction @xmath45 with a kinematical cut of @xmath46 ; for all the other cuts , the branching fraction is extrapolated to the entire phase space . by subdividing the sample into bins , we measure the @xmath47 and @xmath48 distributions as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : xsll ] with a comparison to the sm expectations .",
    "the measured inclusive branching fraction can be compared with the sm prediction of @xmath49 .",
    "the result is in agreement with the sm ; however , the measurement error is still too large to be conclusive .",
    "we also performed a separate analysis for the exclusive @xmath50 modes with the same @xmath43 dataset @xcite .",
    "we increased the precision of the @xmath11 result , but no significant signal was observed for @xmath51 for which we quote a 90% confidence level upper limit .",
    "the updated results are @xmath52    the number of events in the inclusive measurement indicates that the first measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry will be feasible in near future using the pseudo - reconstruction samples , even after excluding the @xmath11 contribution which does not produce an asymmetry .",
    "the exclusive @xmath51 mode is also expected to be observed soon , and a forward - backward asymmetry measurement using the exclusive sample will be complementary .    to",
    "the exclusive radiative decay @xmath53 provides one of the most precise measurements among @xmath6 meson rare decays .",
    "signal is clearly seen as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kstargam - acp ] separately for each @xmath54 final state and charge .",
    "we measured the @xmath53 branching fractions and cp asymmetry using a @xmath43 dataset @xcite @xmath55 the branching fraction may be compared with the sm prediction , for example , @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the predicted branching fraction is higher than the measured value , but one can not consider this seriously due to large model - dependent form factor uncertainties in the prediction .",
    "we also note that the branching fraction for the neutral and charged decays are about the same size , and are not yet sensitive to the isospin asymmetry proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to    on the other hand ,",
    "cp asymmetry is a theoretically clean handle to search for new physics .",
    "a non - zero cp asymmetry is a clear indication of new physics , since the sm predicts a very small cp asymmetry of less than 1% .",
    "the measured asymmetry is already as small as 5% , and will be further improved by adding more data . with an anticipated @xmath19 data set",
    ", the error will be about 2% including the systematic error , and the total error will be still dominated by the statistics .",
    "belle has also explored other exclusive @xmath1 decays as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kpipigam ] using a @xmath20 dataset @xcite . in the @xmath57 final state",
    ", we clearly observe a tensor component of @xmath58 .",
    "when we add one more pion , we also observe the @xmath6 decay signal which is consistent with a sum of @xmath59 and @xmath60 final states .",
    "we obtained branching fractions @xmath61 assuming isospin symmetry to extrapolate to the other charge combinations , the @xmath62 and @xmath63 final states cover about @xmath64 of the total @xmath65 branching fractions , and hence it is important to understand these decays for a further precision measurement of inclusive @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath2 process is expected to be observed in one of the exclusive modes , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the analysis is similar to the study of @xmath53 .",
    "since the expected branching fraction is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath53 , continuum background is very high .",
    "@xmath53 is also a significant background , since the particle identification , which is mainly based on the threshold aerogel cherenkov detector , has almost 10% kaon to pion fake rate .",
    "candidate @xmath68 ( @xmath69 )",
    "mesons are selected in a window of @xmath70 @xmath71 around the nominal mass .",
    "about a half of the @xmath54 with a pion mass hypothesis for the kaon falls into this @xmath68 mass window .",
    "the @xmath72 background is much more severe in the neutral mode , since the sub - decay branching fraction of @xmath73 is twice as high as that of @xmath74 and the expected branching fraction for @xmath75 is twice as low as that for @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , we explicitly reject the events if the @xmath77 invariant mass ( with a kaon mass hypothesis for one of the pions ) is in a range of @xmath78 of the @xmath54 mass .    using a @xmath79 dataset , we performed a simultaneous fit to the three modes of @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( we denote as @xmath83 ) with an assumption of the isospin relation @xmath84 . in this case , we neglect isospin violating effects such as the annihilation diagram contribution that only appears in @xmath85 .",
    "we also perform a simultaneous fit to the three @xmath83 modes and two @xmath72 modes to evaluate the ratio @xmath86 . for this updated analysis , we reoptimized the signal yield extraction method from the previous analysis with @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "we decided to use a fit to the distribution of the energy difference ( @xmath87 ) , from a toy monte carlo study to optimize the result of the ratio .",
    "after selecting the events in the @xmath88 window of @xmath31 and optimizing the continuum suppression cut , which is based on a likelihood ratio of the @xmath6 meson flight direction and a fisher discriminant formed from a modified set of fox - wolfram moments , we fit the @xmath87 distribution with a linear continuum background component , a mc determined @xmath6 decay background component and two crystal ball line shapes to represent the signal and the @xmath72 component ( not in the @xmath82 mode ) .",
    "the @xmath87 peak is shifted by @xmath89 for the @xmath72 background .",
    "the individual fit result for each mode is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhogam ] .",
    "we observe no significant signal yield in the individual fits nor in the simultaneous fits , and obtain the following 90% confidence level upper limits @xmath90 these results are still a few times larger than the sm predictions , and the ratio does not give a useful constraint on @xmath16 yet .    to    from the current analysis , one can estimate how much sensitivity we expect on the search for the @xmath91 signal . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhogam - prospects ] , we use the efficiency and the size of the backgrounds in the current analysis to extrapolate the sensitivity for the first observation of the @xmath91 signal .",
    "it is seen that we need @xmath92 to @xmath19 of data if the branching fraction is @xmath93 to @xmath94 as predicted .",
    "once the first branching fraction measurement is made , there will be a 20 to 30% experimental error .",
    "one has to assume a rather large theory error on the form factor ratio between @xmath95 and @xmath96 to interpret the result in terms of @xmath16 . at this moment",
    ", there is no well defined idea to shrink the theory error .",
    "another possibility is to aim for an inclusive measurement of theoretically cleaner @xmath97 .",
    "however , no clear idea is known how one can control the enormous @xmath98 backgrounds , and this may not be a possible project in the coming few years .    to",
    "the long awaited first inclusive measurement of @xmath3 was performed by belle . although the results are consistent with the sm , the error is still large . the results also demonstrate that future programs such as the measurement of the forward backward asymmetry are feasible by adding more data .",
    "exclusive measurements of @xmath1 processes have been extensively carried out by belle .",
    "these results become important to understand the properties of the hadron recoil system in the next @xmath65 measurement , in which we expect a better understanding of systematic errors .",
    "the @xmath2 process has not been measured yet , but with the dataset of about @xmath19 , anticipated in the next few years , it is likely to have the first measurement of the exclusive process @xmath91",
