    "the bright radio source  is extended , has high levels of polarization and shows a non - thermal spectrum , properties which at first led to its classification as a supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "however , high - resolution images revealed a bizarre axial `` head - tail '' structure ( @xcite ; @xcite ; top panel of fig  [ fig_tornado ] ) , for which this source was nicknamed `` the tornado '' .",
    "the morphology of the tornado is very different from the approximately circular morphologies seen in other snrs .",
    "this has led to various claims that the tornado is an exotic snr expanding into an unusual environment , is a nebula powered by a high velocity pulsar , or results from precessing jets from an x - ray binary ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations have provided some new clues .",
    "frail et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) detected a 1720-mhz oh maser from the `` head '' of the tornado .",
    "the 1720  mhz emission , when seen without the other oh maser lines , is produced by shocks propagating into molecular clouds ; further evidence for an interaction with molecular material is provided by the presence of emission from @xmath7co 10 and shock - excited 2.12-@xmath8 m h@xmath9 at this same position and velocity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the maser velocity , also now confirmed by hi  absorption measurements ( @xcite ) , implies a distance to the tornado of 12  kpc .    despite these new data ,",
    "the tornado still defies classification .",
    "most problematic has been the failure to detect emission in other wavebands .",
    "we consequently examined archival _ asca _  data of this region , and identified a weak ( @xmath10 ) x - ray source coincident with the tornado s head ; this marginal detection was also briefly noted by yusef - zadeh et  al .",
    "we here present an observation of the tornado with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    ", aimed at confirming this source of x - rays , and studying its morphology and spectrum .",
    "the tornado was observed with _ chandra _  on 2002 may 07 .",
    "we used the acis - i detector , consisting of an array of four front - illuminated ccds and giving a field of view approximately @xmath11 .",
    "the aimpoint , located near the center of the array , corresponded to coordinates ra ( j2000 ) @xmath12 , decl .",
    "( j2000 ) @xmath13 .",
    "the effective exposure time was 20723  seconds , and was free of background flares .",
    "data were analyzed using ciao  v2.3 .",
    "we used the level-1 events supplied by the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) , and then corrected them for charge - transfer inefficiency using standard cxc routines .",
    "an image was then formed using events in the energy range 0.3 to 10  kev ; point sources in this image were identified using the wavdetectalgorithm within ciao . to highlight diffuse emission",
    ", we applied the adaptive smoothing algorithm csmooth .",
    "we corrected for off - axis vignetting and for the variable exposure produced by chip gaps and bad pixels by forming an exposure map , which we then smoothed with the same kernel as was applied to the image .",
    "applying the smoothed exposure map to the smoothed image resulted in a flux - calibrated image of diffuse emission .",
    "the resulting x - ray image is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig_tornado ] , demonstrating that faint emission is detected from three distinct regions coincident with the tornado , which we label a , b and c.    the brightest x - rays are from region a , lying near the `` head '' of the tornado , and comprising a @xmath14 elliptical region elongated along a position angle @xmath15 ( north through east ) .",
    "comparison with radio data shows that these x - rays are wholly contained within the head region , occupying the western half of the head s interior .",
    "while region a is brighter and more concentrated at its south - eastern tip , no unresolved source is identified in this region by wavdetect , nor is apparent by visual inspection of the unsmoothed image .",
    "regions b and c represent two other possible sources of extended x - rays from the tornado , located @xmath16 east of the head region .",
    "region b is a very faint circular clump of extent @xmath17 , while region c is a brighter and more elongated feature of extent @xmath18 .",
    "given the faintness of regions b and c , we simply note their existence , and defer detailed studies of these regions until deeper observations have been performed .",
    "the wavdetect  algorithm identifies two x - ray point sources lying within the radio boundaries of the tornado , as marked in fig  [ fig_tornado ] .",
    "both sources are of marginal significance , each containing only 56 counts .",
    "of the three extended regions of x - ray emission identified in  [ sec_image ] , only region a is bright enough from which to obtain a useful spectrum .",
    "events were extracted from an elliptical extraction region of dimensions @xmath19 centered on this emission , and the data ( source plus background ) were then regrouped so that there were at least 50 counts in each energy bin .",
    "the effective area for this source spectrum was determined by weighting by the brightness of the source over the extraction region using the ciao task mkwarf .",
    "the local background was determined by extracting a spectrum from an adjacent emission - free region of the ccd immediately to the southwest of region  a.    the corresponding spectrum contains @xmath20 background - subtracted counts , which fall into 12 bins spread over the energy range 0.310  kev .",
    "we fit two simple models to this spectrum : a power law , and a raymond - smith plasma in collisionally ionized equilibrium , both modified by foreground photoelectric absorption .",
    "both models give good fits to the data , the parameters for which are listed in table  [ tab_spec ] .",
    "however , the implied photon index for the best power law fit is unusually steep , @xmath21 at 90% confidence . in table",
    "[ tab_spec ] we also present power law fits for fixed photon indices @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( representing extreme value for observed sources ; see   [ sec_pwn ] & [ sec_snr ] ) , which give comparatively poor fits to the data .",
    "we have clearly identified x - ray emission from the head of the tornado ; the observed count - rate is consistent ( to within @xmath24% ) with the level of emission suggested from archival _ asca _  data .",
    "although we detect relatively few x - ray photons from the tornado , these data provide new constraints on the nature of this complicated source .",
    "stewart et  al .  (",
    "1994 ) propose that the tornado is powered by twin outflows from a central x - ray binary , presumably located in the center of and along the symmetry axis of the overall radio nebula , and which generate opposed precessing jets as is seen for ss  433 in the snr  w50 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we argue in  [ sec_snr ] below that region",
    "a has a thermal spectrum . in the context of the situation proposed by stewart et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , these thermal x - rays might represent the working surface where a collimated outflow from the central source collides and interacts with surrounding gas , as is seen at the termination of the eastern lobe of w50 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    of immediate concern for such a model",
    "is that no bright unresolved x - ray emission , corresponding to a central powering source , is seen along the axis of the tornado .",
    "the @xmath1 upper limit on the count - rate from any such source is @xmath25  cts  s@xmath3 in the energy range 0.310  kev . assuming a foreground absorbing column density of @xmath26  @xmath5 ( see  [ sec_snr ] below ) and a power - law spectrum with photon index @xmath27",
    ", we infer an unabsorbed flux ( 0.510  kev ) for such a source @xmath28  ergs  @xmath5  s@xmath3 , which implies an upper limit on the x - ray luminosity ( 0.510  kev ) @xmath29  ergs  s@xmath3 at a distance of 12  kpc .    from this non - detection an exact analogy with ss  433 can immediately be ruled out : even when not in outburst , such a source would have an x - ray luminosity @xmath30  ergs  s@xmath3 and a 1.4-ghz flux density @xmath31  mjy ( see @xcite and references therein ) , which would have been easily detected in _",
    "chandra _  and vla observations of the tornado , respectively .",
    "however , we below note two other x - ray binaries known to generate outflows , which if embedded in the tornado might not be directly detectable .",
    "the recently discovered high - mass x - ray binary ls  5039 generates steady jets of velocity @xmath32 and kinetic luminosity @xmath33  ergs  s@xmath3 ( @xcite ) , which is consistent with the rate of energy input required to power the radio emission seen from the tornado ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of ls  5039 possibly varies as a function of orbital phase , but at its minimum is only slightly higher than the upper limit determined for any point source in the tornado ( @xcite ) . at a distance of 12",
    "kpc , the 1.4-ghz flux density of this source would only be 13  mjy ( @xcite ) , too faint to be seen in existing vla radio images of this region .",
    "the low - mass x - ray binary 4u  1755 - 338 is currently in a quiescent state with @xmath34  ergs  s@xmath3 , but previously underwent an active phase lasting several decades , in which it generated x - ray jets @xmath354  pc in extent ( @xcite ) .",
    "the tornado could similarly have been powered by a period of prolonged activity , but is now quiescent .",
    "jets of the surface brightness seen for 4u  1755 - 338 would be too faint to be detected here .",
    "we note that an alternative x - ray binary model has been proposed by helfand & becker ( 1985 ) , who argue that the tornado is powered by source at the very western edge of the head , and that the high velocity of the binary then gives the tornado its unusual appearance .",
    "the arguments invoked above can explain the failure to detect x - ray emission from the binary itself .",
    "however , in this model the energetic interaction between the outflow and its surroundings should occur only at the very western edge of the tornado .",
    "in such a situation , there is no simple explanation for the presence of extended x - ray emission from region a , since this should be neither a region of active particle acceleration nor an area in which shock - heated gas is produced .",
    "we therefore think this possibility unlikely .",
    "shull et  al .",
    "( 1989 ) have argued that the tornado is a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) powered by a high - velocity pulsar .",
    "in such a situation , the pulsar is presumed to be inside of or to the west of the head of the tornado .",
    "we can consequently expect to see extended synchrotron x - ray emission from a surrounding pwn , plus possibly unresolved magnetospheric x - ray emission from the pulsar itself .",
    "region a clearly corresponds to x - ray emission in the expected location for this interpretation , and its spectrum can be well - fitted by a power law characteristic of synchrotron emission .",
    "however , all known pwne show power law x - ray spectra with photon indices in the range @xmath36 ( @xcite ) ; table  [ tab_spec ] shows that a photon index even at the upper limit of this range , @xmath37 , gives a comparatively poor fit , which we can exclude at the @xmath38 level .",
    "while more data are needed to confirm whether this source indeed has an anomalously steep spectrum , this measurement suggests that the properties of region a are not consistent with those expected for a pulsar - powered nebula .",
    "we note that while we detect no point source embedded in region  a , the corresponding upper limit @xmath29  ergs  s@xmath3 ( see  [ sec_binary ] above ) is above the x - ray luminosities of many young pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the tornado shows bright , polarized , limb - brightened radio emission with a non - thermal spectrum , properties which resulted in its original classification as a snr .",
    "however , one must then explain its bizarre and unique morphology .    in a dense ambient medium",
    "a supernova progenitor s space velocity can take it near the edge of , or even outside of , its circumstellar bubble before the star explodes .",
    "the snr resulting from such a system will have a highly elongated axial morphology ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , resembling that seen for the tornado .",
    "the oh maser identified towards this source by frail et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) , along with the recent detection of shock - excited 2.12-@xmath8 m h@xmath9 emission and surrounding @xmath7co emission by lazendic et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) , all argue that indeed the tornado is expanding into a dense environment .    for a snr interpretation",
    "there are several different possibilities for the x - ray emission expected .",
    "we might see limb - brightened synchrotron emission from shock - accelerated electrons ( e.g.   g347.30.5 ; @xcite ) , limb - brightened thermal emission from shock - heated ambient gas ( e.g.  1e  0102.27219 ; @xcite ) , or centrally - filled thermal emission from hot gas in the interior , corresponding to a so - called `` mixed morphology '' or ",
    "thermal composite  snr ( e.g.  w44 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray photon index for synchrotron - emitting snrs is in the range @xmath39 ( see @xcite for a review ) which , as for the case of a pwn in  [ sec_pwn ] , is distinctly flatter than the best - fit power law observed . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature of @xmath6  kev implied by thermal models is quite reasonable for thermally emitting snrs , as is the corresponding unabsorbed x - ray luminosity ( 0.510  kev ) of @xmath40  erg  s@xmath3 for a distance of 12  kpc .",
    "the foreground column @xmath4  @xmath5 is high , but is well below the total integrated column in this direction of @xmath41  @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if we identify the head of the tornado as a limb - brightened radio snr , then the emission seen with _",
    "chandra _  originates wholly from the snr interior , and we correspondingly can tentatively classify the tornado as a mixed morphology snr ( as had been earlier speculated by yusef - zadeh et  al .",
    "2003 from the possible presence of _ asca _  emission ) . whether such centrally - filled thermal x - rays are produced by evaporation of dense clouds overrun by the shock , through thermal conduction in the interior , or via",
    "some other process is currently controversial ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , regardless of the mechanism invoked , there have been repeated arguments that such a snr is the result of an interaction with a dense molecular cloud ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the oh maser , 2.12-@xmath8 m h@xmath9 and @xmath7co emission seen here all support this interpretation .",
    "wardle ( 1999 ) has pointed out that the soft x - ray emission produced by a mixed morphology snr can produce the ionizing flux @xmath42  s@xmath3 needed to disassociate h@xmath9o and produce the oh seen in maser emission . at a distance of 12",
    "kpc , the maser produced by the tornado is @xmath43  pc from the source of x - rays , implying a flux as seen by the oh maser @xmath44  ergs  @xmath5  s@xmath3 .",
    "the consequent ionizing flux is @xmath45  s@xmath3 , where @xmath46  kev@xmath3 is the number of electrons produced per kev of ionization and @xmath47 is the photoabsorption cross - section of hydrogen at 1  kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "this rate of ionization is more than sufficient to convert water into oh molecules .",
    "a short observation of  with the _ chandra x - ray observatory_has confirmed the presence of x - ray emission from this remarkable object .",
    "the brightest region of x - rays from this source is clearly extended , seems to sit within the shell of emission defined by the `` head '' of the radio source , and has a highly absorbed spectrum consistent with being either an extremely steep power law or a collisionally ionized plasma at a temperature @xmath48  kev .",
    "we have considered the possibility of the tornado being powered by jets from an x - ray binary , of corresponding to the synchrotron nebula powered by an energetic rotation - powered pulsar , or of representing an unusually - shaped supernova remnant . while the available data do not allow us to definitively rule out any of these alternatives , the spectrum and morphology of the x - ray emission seen by _",
    ", when combined with evidence at other wavebands for the interaction of a shock with a molecular cloud , all suggest that the head of the tornado is a `` mixed morphology '' supernova remnant , producing thermal x - rays from the interior of a limb - brightened radio shell , and expanding into a dense and possibly complicated distribution of ambient gas .",
    "this argument provides a reasonably simple interpretation for the `` head '' of the tornado , but the bizarre morphology of the `` tail '' remains unexplained .",
    "we speculate that the tornado might result from expansion of a snr into a highly elongated progenitor wind bubble , but explanations involving pre - existing helical magnetic fields , or high - speed outflows from a still unseen central source , can also not be discounted .",
    "deep x - ray observations with _ chandra _  and _ xmm _  are needed to better determine the morphology and spectrum of x - rays from the head , and to study the possible x - ray emission from the tail .",
    "we thank dan harris , jasmina lazendic and fred seward for useful discussions , and crystal brogan for supplying us with her radio images of the tornado .",
