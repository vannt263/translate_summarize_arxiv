    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is an important cornerstone of galaxy formation as it links the stellar mass and the luminosity of galaxies by defining the mass distribution of a stellar population from a single star formation burst , at birth . by controlling the ratio of low- to high - mass stars",
    ", the imf also affects the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "observationally , the imf controls the stellar m / l and the conversion of typical diagnostics of star formation ( e.g. nebular lines , as well as uv and fir luminosities ) .    traditionally , the imf is considered universal , fixing its value to constraints from resolved populations in our galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "constraining the imf in distant galaxies is notably difficult because it is not possible to follow the same methodology , relying on photo - spectroscopic proxies , with their inherent , strong degeneracies . although attempts at constraining the imf go back to @xcite , only in the past decade or so it has been possible to detect a systematic trend in galaxies .",
    "there are three independent ways of constraining the imf : i ) dynamical : based on constraints from the kinematics ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; 2 ) lensing : focusing on strong gravitational lenses over galaxy scales ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; 3 ) spectroscopic : targeting selected line strengths sensitive to the presence of low - mass stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "over the past few years , these studies have independently found a significant change in the imf of early - type galaxies ( hereafter etgs ) , with a heavier mass function in the most massive galaxies ( according to the dynamical and lensing studies ) , more specifically with a bottom - heavy shape ( according to spectroscopic studies ) . scaling relations such as the fundamental plane",
    "can also be used to constrain the stellar imf , although this is a more indirect way that relies on assumptions about the scaling of the contribution from dark matter .",
    "such results also suggest a heavier imf in massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "theoretical models relate this trend towards a heavier imf in the most massive etgs with the qualitatively different fragmentation properties expected in the highly turbulent gas during the formation of the cores of this type of galaxies ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although these different methods converge on the same trend , it is important to note that there are substantial degeneracies affecting them .",
    "the lensing and dynamical approaches can robustly constrain the _ total _",
    "m / l , whereas the stellar m / l needs additional assumptions about the dark matter .",
    "@xcite find that even with the assumption of a wide range of dark matter distributions , including the case of zero dark matter , the stellar",
    "m / l is higher in the most massive etgs , leading to a heavy imf . only for the trivial assumption of dark matter following identically the light , it is possible to discard a systematic variation of the imf .",
    "the systematic effects in spectroscopic constraints mostly relate to the interpretation of the gravity - sensitive line strengths .",
    "these indices are measured in unresolved populations , whose spectral features are produced by blending of a large number of stellar absorption lines .",
    "such mixtures introduce degeneracies with respect to age , metallicity , [ @xmath8/fe ] , or even individual abundance variations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite compared the dynamical and spectroscopic constraints to the imf , finding residuals that correlate according to their expected systematics : the spectral index analysis correlated with [ mg / fe ] , whereas the dynamical analysis correlated with velocity dispersion . however , in a follow - up paper , @xcite showed that this result was dependent on the population synthesis models used . in their analysis of stacked sdss spectra ,",
    "the only trend found for the imf slope was with velocity dispersion , in agreement with the dynamical studies .",
    "continuing the challenge to the interpretation of the data as imf variations , @xcite and @xcite presented very interesting constraints on the stellar m / l in a reduced sample of strong gravitational lenses .",
    "these systems feature a high velocity dispersion , and therefore should lead to a bottom - heavy imf .",
    "however , the lensing analysis produced a relatively low stellar m / l , leading to a standard imf .",
    "could these gravitational lenses be biased tracers of the populations in massive etgs ?",
    "the analysis of @xcite on a sample of gravitational lenses  revisiting the work of @xcite  gave the trend expected from dynamical analysis of spectral line strengths , namely a heavy stellar m / l in massive galaxies .",
    "this controversial picture is in need of more data and analysis , to robustly assess imf variations .",
    "this paper addresses the mismatch from gravitational lensing by jointly comparing the lensing mass profile and the stellar mass profile .",
    "in contrast to previous studies based on the slacs sample ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) our approach is different in the derivation of both the lensing and the stellar population constraints .",
    "the former is derived from the lens geometry , applying a robust non - parametric approach . for the latter , we fit the available sdss spectra to the latest set of population synthesis models from @xcite that allow for a wide range of population parameters , most importantly including two different functional forms of the imf .",
    "we want to emphasise that unlike the studies shown above , we do not use any information on stellar dynamics to separate the stellar mass component .",

    "<S> we combine photometric and spectroscopic constraints from the latest set of population synthesis models of charlot & bruzual , including a varying imf , with a non - parametric analysis of the lens masses of 18 etgs from the slacs survey , with velocity dispersions in the range 200300kms@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that very bottom - heavy imfs are excluded . </S>",
    "<S> however , the upper limit to the bimodal imf slope ( @xmath1 , accounting for a dark matter fraction of 20 - 30% , where @xmath2 corresponds to a kroupa - like imf ) is compatible at the 1@xmath3 level with constraints imposed by gravity - sensitive line strengths . </S>",
    "<S> a two - segment power law parameterisation of the imf ( salpeter - like for high masses ) is more constrained ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the power index at low masses ) but requires a dark matter contribution of @xmath6 to reconcile the results with a salpeter imf . for a standard milky way - like imf to be applicable , </S>",
    "<S> a significant dark matter contribution is required within @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal a large range of allowed imf slopes , which , when interpreted as intrinsic scatter in the imf properties of etgs , could explain the recent results of smith et al . </S>",
