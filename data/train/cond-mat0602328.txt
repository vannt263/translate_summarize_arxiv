    "the study of quantum antiferromagnetic spin models with strong frustration has attracted great attentions over the past decades .",
    "early investigations of the frustrated quantum magnets were partly motivated by the work of anderson to search the resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) ground state in such systems @xcite . in the frustrated quantum magnets , the magnetic ordering",
    "is generally suppressed by the frustration .",
    "some well - studied frustrated magnetic systems include , for example , the kagome lattice and pyrochlore lattice , in which the interplay between frustration and quantum fluctuation leads to rich varieties of phenomena .",
    "recently , the frustrated magnets are believed to be prominent candidates of realizing spin liquid states with exotic ground state and deconfined fractional excitations @xcite .",
    "while the mechanism of deconfinment in two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnetic systems is less clear , the deconfinement of spinons in quasi - one - dimensional magnetic system , which is closely related to the phenomenon of spin charge separation , is well investigated @xcite . since 1980 s , a large number of low - dimensional frustrated magnets have been synthesized experimentally@xcite . generally speaking , strongly geometrical frustration in these systems allows the simple dimerized state to be the ground state of the low - dimensional frustrated spin system and opens a spin gap .",
    "so far , a variety of quasi - one - dimensional frustrated models have been studied theoretically@xcite .",
    "additionally , important progress has been made in trapping cold atoms under a highly controllable way very recently , and thus it stimulates intensive investigation on how to simulate the magnetic systems using cold atoms .",
    "a number of schemes have been proposed to implement a variety of quantum spin models in optical lattices @xcite .    in this article , we investigate both the ground- and excited - state properties of the spin models on a one - dimensional ( 1d ) tetrahedron chain as shown in fig .",
    "1 , with site spins @xmath8 residing in four corners of each tetrahedron . the basic unit , i.e , a tetrahedron is composed of four spins with equal antiferromagnetic exchanges between each pair of spins . the tetrahedron chain can be also viewed as a 1d pyrochlore strip in a 2d pyrochlore lattice , in which only two of four corners of each tetrahedron are shared by a neighboring tetrahedron . generally , a three - dimensional ( 3d ) pyrochlore lattice is a network of corner - sharing tetrahedra and a 2d pyrochlore model , named also as a checkerboard - lattice model , is obtained by a projection of the 3d lattice on a plane .",
    "different from the 1d pyrochlore strip considering in this article , for both the 3d and 2d pyrochlore lattices , each corner of the tetrahedron is shared by a neighboring tetrahedron .",
    "as one of the most frustrated antiferromagnets , the model of spin pyrochlore lattice has been investigated by a variety of techniques including the semiclassical large-@xmath3 limit , large-@xmath9 expansion of the @xmath10 model , the contractor renormalization method based on the cluster expansion , and the bosonization method on the anisotropic limit@xcite . in spite of the intensive research , even the ground state properties of the 3d pyrochlore lattice are not well understood . for the 2d pyrochlore lattice",
    ", the numerical results based on exact diagonizations have shown that the ground state has plaquette order@xcite . however , for the 1d pyrochlore strip , we can determine its ground state and elementary excitation in an exact manner . with the aid of numerical diagonalization of the corresponding spin lattice systems with small sizes , we also investigate the quantum phase transitions of the ground state due to the change of exchange strengths along perpendicular rungs .",
    "the spin model on a 1d pyrochlore strip as shown in fig.1 is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes sum over all the nearest neighbors along the tetrahedron chain and @xmath13 represents the spin operator residing in site @xmath14 . in this work ,",
    "we study both the spin-@xmath15 and spin-@xmath5 models on the pyrochlore strip .",
    "our results show that the excitation spectrum for the spin-@xmath16 system is gapless and the elementary excitation of the spin-@xmath5 system has a finite spin gap .",
    "this model can be extended to the cases where the strengths of bonds among the tetrahedra are not homogeneous .",
    "here we only consider the inhomogeneous case as shown in fig .",
    "1b , where we use @xmath17 to represent the exchange strength along the vertical rung of each tetrahedron .",

    "since the model can be represented as a sum of local hamiltonian on each tetrahedron , a classical ground state is obtained whenever the total spin in the tetrahedron is zero for a homogeneous model .",
    "it is straightforward that the classical ground states have a continuous local degeneracy .    )",
    "firstly , we consider the spin @xmath16 case . as we have mentioned in the introduction , there is a fundamental different property between the 1d pyrochlore strip and its high - dimensional analogies : not all spins on a tetrahedron are equivalent .",
    "the spins on the vertical rung of the tetrahedron are not coupled to the neighboring tetrahedron .",
    "we define the total spin on each vertical rung as @xmath21 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath22 is conserved .",
    "this property enables us to simplify the 1d model greatly .    for the tetrahedron chain model ( 2 )",

    "this implies that the spins in the horizontal direction along the chain is effectively decoupled with the spins on the vertical rungs .",

    "since the total spin in every rung is conserved , the vertical rungs are either in singlets or triplets for a spin-@xmath16 pyrochlore strip .",

    "is to prevent the spins on the rung forming triplet . on the other hand , a triplet in the rung acts effectively as a spin with @xmath1 which lowers the total energy by interacting with its neighboring spins with @xmath0 on the lower rung .",

    "the process of hopping from site @xmath195 to @xmath196 or @xmath197 accompanies with an energy cost of @xmath198 , and thus the excitation spectrum is still a flat band for the homogeneous pyrochlore with @xmath52 . for the inhomogeneous case ,",

    "we also studied the @xmath6 spin - exchange model on the 1d tetrahedron chain , for which the ground sate is a double degenerate trimerized state and the elementary excitations are fractionalized topological excitations .",
    "our results indicate that the properties of the ground state for the pyrochlore systems with half - integer and integer spins or the systems with the same spins but different internal symmetries ( @xmath205 and @xmath6 for spin-1 systems ) are quite different .",
