    ", we apply these models to a preliminary study of the @xmath0 relation for wr stars , which is important for the study of wr stars as progenitors of long - duration gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "the details of the basic model are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we compare our results with those from @xcite ( hereafter vdk ) using their wn star parameters ( see figure [ vdfig ] ) .",
    "the metal abundances were provided by a. heger ( private communication ) from a 25 @xmath5  evolution model based on solar abundances from @xcite . while the @xmath2 from these abundances is smaller than the traditional @xmath6 , uncertainties in other model parameters",
    "are expected to dominate over uncertainties in abundance .",
    "figure [ vdfig ] shows the metallicity dependence of our wnl model , as compared to the model in vdk .",
    "a least - squares fit to our result over @xmath3 gives @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , very close to the vdk result of @xmath9 .",
    "it appears that our @xmath1  flattens more quickly than those of vdk , perhaps because fe saturates more quickly with our more complete line list .",

    "we have applied analytic wr wind models to the study of @xmath1  as a function of @xmath2 . our preliminary results for a wnl - type star show a power - law dependence of @xmath1  with @xmath2 over @xmath12 , with index @xmath8 , similar to the the findings vdk .",
