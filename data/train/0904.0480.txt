    "dilute atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are accurately described by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , alias the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) @xcite .",
    "the sign of the cubic term in the gpe corresponds to the self - defocusing or focusing , if interactions between atoms in the condensate are characterized , respectively , by the positive or negative _ s_-wave scattering length .",
    "the self - focusing gpe in any dimension ( 1d , 2d , or 3d ) gives rise to soliton solutions , which are stable in the 1d case .",
    "the creation of 1d matter - wave solitons has been reported in experimental works @xcite , while 2d and 3d solitons are unstable against the critical and supercritical collapse , respectively ( these 2d states are usually called _ townes solitons _ , tss ) @xcite .",
    "it was predicted that tss may be stabilized in the framework of the 2d gpe , without using an external potential , if the constant scattering length is replaced by a time - dependent one , that periodically changes its sign book - boris . in bec , this can be implemented by means of the _ feshbach - resonance management _ ( frm ) , i.e. , by applying a low - frequency ac magnetic field which acts via the feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "this stabilization mechanism was demonstrated in optics , in terms of the transmission of a light beam through a bulk medium composed of layers with alternating signs of the kerr nonlinearity @xcite , and then in the framework of the 2d gpe @xcite .",
    "a somewhat similar technique was proposed recently , making use of a linear coupling , induced by means of a resonant electromagnetic wave , between two different hyperfine states of atoms , which feature opposite signs of the scattering length randy .",
    "the analysis of the frm was extended to include averaging techniques @xcite , generation of solitons from periodic waves periodic , the stabilization of higher - order solitons @xcite , management of discrete arrays @xcite , and the case of a chirped modulation frequency @xcite .",
    "however , the stabilization based on the frm may be , strictly speaking , a transient dynamical regime , as extremely long simulations suggest that the frm - stabilized ts may be subject to a very slow decay @xcite .",
    "the stabilization of 3d solitons by means of the frm technique alone is not possible , but stable 3d solitons were predicted in a model combining the frm and a 1d periodic potential @xcite .",
    "similarly , the stabilization is possible when the frm is applied in combination with a parabolic potential which strongly confines the condensate in one direction @xcite .",
    "most relevant to the experiment is the  cigar - shaped \" setting , with the bec tightly confined in two transverse directions , while the third direction remains free @xcite . in the usual approximation , with the cubic nonlinearity in the corresponding 1d gpe ,",
    "the analysis of the frm in the latter setting amounts to that reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , if the density of the condensate is not very low , the description in terms of the cubic nonlinearity is inappropriate , the respective 1d equation taking the form of the _ nonpolynomial schrdinger equation _ ( npse ) . in particular , it admits the onset of the collapse in the self - attractive condensate in the framework of the 1d description sala1 .",
    "accordingly , a relevant problem , which is the subject of the present work , is to study the possibility of the collapse suppression by means of the frm technique in the framework of the 1d npse .",
    "it is relevant to mention that the npse was recently used to describe faraday waves generated in the cigar - shaped trap by a time - periodic modulation of the strength of the transverse confinement @xcite .",
    "we introduce the model in section 2 , and report results obtained by means of systematic numerical simulations in section 3 .",
    "the normalized form of the 3d gpe with the transverse harmonic trapping potential , which acts in the @xmath0 plane , is @xmath1 \\psi .",

    "@xcite , this was called _ two - dimensional primary collapse _ , as it is related to the transverse 2d dynamics .",
    "in addition to the dynamical collapse , the npse also admits a _ static collapse _ , in the framework of stationary equation ( [ phi ] ) : for @xmath13 and @xmath15 , this equation admits bright - soliton solutions only below the critical value of the nonlinearity strength , @xmath30 @xcite . at @xmath31 ,",
    "the axial density @xmath32 in the bright - soliton solution is smaller than the critical value imposed by condition ( dyn - coll ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this kind of the collapse was called _ three - dimensional primary collapse _ , as it involves a quasi - spherical 3d soliton .  with regard to the definition of @xmath33 , this restriction determines the largest number of atoms possible in the soliton , @xmath34 . with @xmath35 and @xmath36 on the order of @xmath37 m and @xmath38 nm , respectively , which is typical for experiments in the @xmath39li condensate @xcite , one has @xmath40 atoms .    the frm technique which makes it possible to stabilize 2d matter - wave solitons is based on the respective gpe , @xmath41with @xmath42 , so that @xmath43 alternates between attraction and repulsion .",
    "the stabilization requires the presence of the constant (  dc \" ) component which corresponds to the self - attraction on the average , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "the action of the frm within the framework of the npse was not considered before .",
    "to explore this situation , we take @xmath43 as indicated above , arriving at the following modification of eq .

    "localized solutions to eq .",
    "( [ 1dfeshbach ] ) were categorized as stable ones if , in direct simulations , they featured persistent pulsations , avoiding collapse or decay up to @xmath47 ( in some cases , the stability was checked up to @xmath48 ) .",
    "however , the application of this criterion to the case of @xmath49 is complicated by the fact that , under the action of the low - frequency management , the soliton tends to develop an apparently chaotic behavior , although without a trend to decay , see below .",
    "fixing the time interval as that comprising a large number of periods , simulations become increasingly more difficult for @xmath50 .",
    "the simulations we performed by means of the crank - nicolson algorithm with open - ended boundary conditions .",
    "the initial state was @xmath51 , that was refined by the integration of eq .",

    "it happens when the argument of the square root in eq .",
    "( [ 1dfeshbach ] ) becomes zero , i.e. , the transverse width of the soliton shrinks to zero .",
