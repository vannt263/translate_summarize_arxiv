    "since the solution of the riemann problem has been introduced in numerical hydrodynamics ( godunov 1959 ) , high resolution shock capturing methods have become a common tool for handling nonlinear hydrodynamical waves in a variety of physical situations and the subject of detailed mathematical analyses both in newtonian ( leveque 1992 , toro 1997 ) and relativistic regimes ( smoller & temple 1993 ) .",
    "nonlinear waves of this type are very common in astrophysical scenarios ( such as gamma - ray bursts , accretion onto compact objects , relativistic jets , supernova explosions ) in which the motion of the fluid is characterised by relativistic speeds and by the appearance of strong discontinuities ( see ibaez & mart , 1999 and mart & mller , 1999 for a review ) . in a recent paper , rezzolla & zanotti ( 2001 , hereafter paper i ) have proposed a new procedure for the exact solution of the riemann problem which uses the relativistically invariant relative velocity between the unperturbed `` left '' and `` right '' states of the fluid in order to extract important information contained in the initial data and that more traditional approaches were not able to put into evidence .",
    "most notably , it was shown that , given a riemann problem with assigned initial conditions , it is possible to determine in advance both the wave - pattern that will be produced after the removal of the initial planar discontinuity and the bracketing interval of the unknown pressure in the region that forms behind the wave fronts . besides clarifying some aspects of the riemann problem ,",
    "the approach proposed by rezzolla & zanotti , and that was foreseen by landau & lifshitz ( 1959 ) in newtonian hydrodynamics , was shown to be computationally more efficient as compared to the more traditional ones .    in a recent work ,",
    "( 2000 ) have extended the analytic solution of the one - dimensional riemann problem ( mart & mller 1994 ) to the case in which nonzero velocities tangential to the initial planar discontinuity are present .",
    "an important result obtained by pons _",
    "et al _ ( 2000 ) was to show that the introduction of tangential velocities and the appearance of global lorentz factors linking quantities on either side of the discontinuity can affect the solution of the riemann problem considerably . in the present paper",
    "we show that the approach by rezzolla & zanotti can be successfully extended to this more general case and with the same advantages that were found in the case of zero tangential velocities . within this new procedure ,",
    "the introduction of tangential velocities is imprinted in the expression for the jump of the velocity normal to the discontinuity surface , and this has allowed us to reveal interesting special relativistic effects . in relativistic hydrodynamics , in fact",
    ", the wave - pattern produced by the decay of the initial discontinuity can be changed by simply varying the tangential velocities in the initial states , while keeping the rest of the thermodynamic quantities of the riemann problem unmodified .",
    "this effect has no analogue in newtonian hydrodynamics ( rezzolla & zanotti 2002 ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : after a review of the method in section 2 , we report in section 3 the hydrodynamical equations relevant for the present discussion of nonzero tangential velocities . in section 4",
    "we show how to use the invariant relative velocity to extract from the initial data the information on the wave - pattern produced , while section 5 is devoted to the presentation of the special relativistic effects .",
    "the conclusions of the paper are in section 6 , and two appendices complete the discussion providing the mathematical details of the results obtained in the main text .",
    "we use in this paper a system of units in which @xmath0 , a space - like signature @xmath1 and a cartesian coordinate system @xmath2 .",
    "greek indices are taken to run from 0 to 3 , latin indices from 1 to 3 and we adopt the standard convention for the summation over repeated indices .",
    "in a flat spacetime consider a perfect fluid described by the stress - energy tensor : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the proper energy density , the isotropic pressure , the proper rest mass density , and the specific enthalpy , respectively",
    ".    further assume the fluid to consist of an initial `` left '' state ( indicated with an index @xmath9 ) and an initial `` right '' state ( indicated with an index @xmath10 ) , each having prescribed and different values of uniform pressure , rest - mass density and velocity .",
    "the two discontinuous states are initially separated by a planar surface @xmath11 placed at a constant value of the @xmath12 coordinate so that the unit space - like 4-vector @xmath13 normal to this surface at @xmath14 has components @xmath15 is defined as the one - form mapping each vector tangent to the surface into zero . ] . because we are considering a multidimensional flow , the fluid 4-velocity on either side of the initial discontinuity is allowed to have components in spatial directions orthogonal to @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the square of the lorentz factor and @xmath18 is the norm of the 3-velocity .",
    "the hydrodynamical properties of the initial left and right states are described by the `` state - vectors '' @xmath19 where we have indicated with @xmath20^{1/2}$ ] the _ tangential _ component of the three velocity , satisfying the obvious relativistic constraint that @xmath21 ( note that in paper i the 4-velocity vector was chosen so that @xmath22 ) .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to @xmath23 as the _ normal _ velocity .",
    "the fluid states @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent the initial conditions of a multidimensional  ` riemann problem' whose solution consists of determining the flow that develops when the system is allowed to relax . in general",
    ", the temporal evolution can be indicated as ( mart & mller 1994 ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes a nonlinear wave ( either a shock , @xmath28 , or a rarefaction wave , @xmath29 ) , propagating towards the left @xmath30 or the right @xmath31 with respect to the initial discontinuity .",
    "moreover , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the new hydrodynamic states that form behind the two nonlinear waves propagating in opposite directions .",
    "a contact discontinuity , @xmath34 , separates the region @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and it is characterised by the fact that both the pressure and the normal velocity are continuous across it , while both the rest - mass density and the tangential velocities can be discontinuous .",
    "the approach introduced in paper i focuses on @xmath35 , the relativistic invariant expression for the relative velocity between the two unperturbed initial states . by construction",
    ", this quantity measures the relativistic jump of the fluid velocity normal to the discontinuity surface .",
    "the solution of the relativistic riemann problem is then found after the pressure in the region between the two nonlinear waves , @xmath36 , is calculated as the root of the nonlinear equation @xmath37 where @xmath38 has a functional form that is _ different _ for each of the _ three _ possible wave - patterns that might result from the decay of the initial discontinuity .",
    "the key aspect of the new approach is that the wave - pattern produced by the decay of the initial discontinuity can be entirely predicted in terms of the initial data @xmath39 .",
    "this represents an important advantage since it allows to deduce in advance which set of equations to use for the solution of the exact riemann problem and the interval bracketing the root of ( [ our ] ) .",
    "the validity of the approach discussed in paper i is in the mathematical proof that the function @xmath40 is monotonically increasing with @xmath36 and it is composed of three branches corresponding to the three possible wave - patterns .",
    "furthermore , the three different branches always join smoothly through specific values of @xmath38 , denoted respectively as @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 indicate a two shock , a shock - rarefaction and a two rarefaction wave - pattern , respectively . ]",
    "fig . 1 of paper i ) .",
    "in view of these properties , it is possible to compare @xmath35 with the relevant limiting values @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath46 constructed from the initial conditions and determine , prior to the solution of equation ( [ our ] ) , both the wave - pattern that will be produced and the functional form of @xmath38 to be used .",
    "the logical scheme to be followed in this procedure is synthesised as follows @xmath47 after the initial relative normal - velocity @xmath35 has been compared with the limiting values for the different branches and the correct wave - pattern [ i.e. the functional form @xmath38 ] has been found , the numerical solution of the exact riemann problem can be performed .",
    "furthermore , the knowledge of the wave - pattern relevant for the solution of the problem provides the values @xmath49 and @xmath50 bracketing the unknown pressure @xmath36 . in the case of a one - dimensional flow ,",
    "the bracketing interval is sinthesized in the scheme below    0.5truecm     & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 + & & & + @xmath50 & max@xmath54 & min@xmath54 & 0 + & & & + @xmath49 & @xmath55 & max@xmath54 & min@xmath54 +    0.8truecm    in practice , this novel approach has two major advantages .",
    "firstly , it results into a straightforward numerical implementation and in a more efficient numerical algorithm with a reduction of the computational costs .",
    "secondly , it simplifies considerably the logic formulation of the relativistic riemann problem . as we shall discuss in section [ effect ] , this feature has been essential in revealing new special relativistic effects .",
    "the extension of the approach presented in paper i to the case when tangential velocities are present is straightforward and equation ( [ our ] ) as well as the logical scheme ( [ logic ] ) apply unmodified , where @xmath56 is the maximum allowed value of the normal relative velocity that is compatible with the assigned initial tangential velocities . ] .",
    "the only changes introduced by the presence of tangential velocities are restricted to the expressions for the limiting values of the relative velocity @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath46 .",
    "the details of these changes will be presented in the following sections which have been written for a generic equation of state ( eos ) and use an ideal fluid eos as a test case .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the expression for the relative normal - velocity between the two initial states of the riemann problem represents the building block in our approach and , to simplify our notation , hereafter we will refer to the different flow regions using the following mapping @xmath57 while the values of @xmath58 are relativistic invariants , there exists a reference frame which is better suited to evaluate this quantity . in the reference frame of the contact discontinuity , in fact , the normal velocities behind the nonlinear waves are , by definition , zero ( i.e. @xmath59 ) and the relative velocities across the nonlinear waves measured in this reference frame will be @xmath60 because of their invariance , the normal velocity jumps across the nonlinear waves measured in the eulerian frame can be expressed as @xmath61 as a result , the relative normal - velocity between the two initial states can be written as @xmath62    in what follows we will briefly discuss how to calculate the normal - velocity jump across a shock wave and a rarefaction wave , respectively .",
    "the expressions derived in this way will then be used to calculate @xmath63 and @xmath64 necessary to build @xmath40 [ cf .",
    "( [ g_vrel ] ) ] .      following pons _",
    "( 2000 ) , we use the rankine - hugoniot conditions in the fixed eulerian reference frame to express the normal velocity of the fluid on the back of the shock front in terms of the pressure .",
    "rather , the ratio of the velocities ahead and behind the shock front need to be found as root of a nonlinear equation . analytic solutions to this equation can be found only in the _ weak - shock _ limit or for an ultrarelativistic equation of state ( see koenigl 1980 for a discussion ) . ]",

    "when considering a rarefaction wave it is convenient to introduce the self - similar variable in terms of which similarity solutions to the hydrodynamical equations can be found . an explicit expression for @xmath87",
    "can be obtained by requiring that non - trivial similarity solutions for the rarefaction wave exist . this then yields ( see pons _",

    ", the isentropic character of the flow allows to calculate the velocity on the back of the wave as a solution of an ordinary differential equation @xmath89 in principle , to calculate the normal fluid velocity at the tail of the rarefaction wave one should solve the ordinary differential equation ( [ v_b_r ] ) , which might be very expensive numerically . to overcome this , it is convenient to make use of constraints such as those in expressions ( [ rh_tan ] ) ( which remain valid also across a rarefaction wave ) and express equation ( [ v_b_r ] ) in a different way . defining @xmath90 , the tangential velocity along a rarefaction wave can be expressed as @xmath91\\ .\\ ] ] this allows us to eliminate the dependence on @xmath92 from equation ( [ xi6 ] ) . from the definition of the lorentz factor and equation ( [ vt2 ] )",
    "it is straightforward to obtain @xmath93 and after some algebra one can arrive at @xmath94 using this results , equation ( [ v_b_r ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath95 note that in this way we have isolated the thermodynamical quantities on the right hand side of ( [ raref2 ] ) and the kinematical ones on the left hand side , which can then be integrated analytically .",
    "for some particular cases ( for example when the sound speed is constant ) , the right hand side too is integrable but for a generic eos a numerical integration is necessary . the velocity at the tail of the rarefaction wave can then be obtained directly as @xmath96 where @xmath97 here , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , and the isentropic character of rarefaction waves allows to fix @xmath101 . despite its complicated look , the integrand is a smooth , monotonic function of @xmath6 , and a gaussian quadrature with only 10 - 20 points has proved to be more accurate and efficient than a third order runge - kutta integrator requiring hundreds of function evaluations to solve ( [ v_b_r ] ) .",
    "testing and details on the numerical implementation of this procedure will be reported in a separate work .",
    "a couple remarks should now be made about the flow properties of a multidimensional and relativistic riemann problem .",
    "the first remark is about the flow conditions at the contact discontinuity where , as mentioned before , not only the rest - mass density but also the tangential velocities can be discontinuous .",
    "it is well known that under these conditions a kelvin - helmholtz ( or shear - layer ) instability could develop ( chandrasekhar , 1961 ) , reach the nonlinear waves if these move subsonically and thus destroy the solution of the riemann problem .",
    "while this could be a concern in principle , it is never a problem in practice .",
    "the reason for this is simple and is related to the fact that any implementation of an exact riemann solver in a numerical code will provide the solution of the riemann problem at a new time - level which is `` courant - friedrichs - lewy limited '' from the previous one ( press _ et al _ 1986 ) . besides providing numerical stability , this time - step limitation also guarantees that the solution at the new time - level is everywhere causally connected with the one at the previous one . as a result , even if a kelvin - helmholtz instability would develop at the contact discontinuity propagating outward in the flow at the sound speed , this would not be able to influence the dynamics of the nonlinear waves over the time of interest in numerical calculations .",
    "the second remark is about the presence of tangential velocities across a shock - wave which can be in general discontinuous . while the stability of relativistic planar shocks in one - dimensional flows has been the subject of several investigations in the past ( anile & russo 1987a , 1987b , anile 1989 ) , very little if anything at all is known about the stability properties of shock waves with discontinuous tangential velocities .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that a nonzero mass flux across these discontinuities would stabilise them against the kelvin - helmholtz instability , but further work needs to be done in this direction before a conclusion can be drawn .",
    "as mentioned in the previous sections , the basic operation in our approach consists of calculating the relative normal - velocity across the two initial states and comparing it with the limiting relative velocities for each of the three possible wave - patterns . in practice , this amounts to calculating equation ( [ g_vrel ] ) making use of expressions ( [ 1c ] ) and ( [ 2c ] ) . in the following",
    "we will briefly discuss the guidelines for the evaluation of the limiting relative velocities .",
    "in doing so we will adopt the convention of paper i and assume that @xmath102 , with the @xmath103axis normal to the discontinuity surface being positively oriented from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "we first consider a wave - pattern in which two shock waves propagate in opposite directions . in this case , the general expression for the relative normal - velocities between the two initial states @xmath105 can be calculated from ( [ g_vrel ] ) with the velocities behind the shock waves @xmath106 and @xmath107 being determined through the jump condition ( [ v_b_s ] ) . because @xmath108 is the smallest value that the pressure at the contact discontinuity @xmath109 can take , the limiting value for the two shock waves branch @xmath41 can be expressed as @xmath110 evaluating the limit ( [ vtv12s ] ) basically involves calculating the limits of @xmath111 and @xmath64 for @xmath109 tending to @xmath108 .",
    "both these limits are straightforward to calculate and are @xmath112 where @xmath113 is simply the value of @xmath106 for @xmath114 , i.e. @xmath115 using now the limits ( [ ulims_a])([ulims_b ] ) and some lengthy but straightforward algebra , the explicit analytic expression for the limiting value of the two shock waves branch can be calculated as @xmath116 + p_1 - p_2\\ } }   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath117 is the velocity of the shock wave propagating towards the right in the limit of @xmath118 and an explicit expression for it can be found in appendix b in the case of an ideal fluid .",
    "expression ( [ capo1 ] ) will be discussed further in section  [ effect ] but it sufficient to point out here that the threshold value @xmath119 does not depend on the initial velocity in the state 1 , @xmath120 .",
    "we next consider the wave - pattern consisting of a rarefaction wave propagating towards the left and of a shock wave propagating towards the right .",
    "also in this case , @xmath122 can be calculated from ( [ g_vrel ] ) with @xmath107 being determined through the jump condition ( [ v_b_s ] ) and @xmath106 from the numerical integration of equation ( [ v_b_r ] ) in the range @xmath123 $ ] . because @xmath124 is now the lowest pressure in the unknown region behind the two nonlinear waves , the limiting value for the one shock and one rarefaction waves branch @xmath125 can be expressed as @xmath126 in the limit @xmath127 , the right - propagating shock is suppressed , @xmath128 so that @xmath129 and @xmath130 defining now @xmath131 and using ( [ newraref ] ) , it is readily obtained that @xmath132 where the above integral can be evaluated numerically",
    ". a better look at the integral shows that only quantities in the left state are involved ( through the constant @xmath133 ) and that @xmath134 does not depend on the initial velocity in the state 2 , @xmath135 .",
    "this property has an important consequence that will be discussed in section  [ effect ] .",
    "when the wave - pattern consists of two rarefaction waves propagating in opposite directions , @xmath137 can be calculated from ( [ g_vrel ] ) with the velocities behind the waves being calculated using ( [ newraref ] ) and ( [ newraref2 ] ) .",
    "since the lowest value of the pressure behind the tails of the rarefaction waves is zero , the limiting value for the two rarefaction waves branch @xmath46 is given by @xmath138 proceeding as in previous subsection , we can now express @xmath139 as @xmath140 where @xmath141 and where @xmath142 .",
    "while , the determination of @xmath139 requires the numerical calculation of the integrals ( [ capo3_a ] ) and ( [ capo3_b ] ) , it has very little practical importance as it marks the transition to a wave - pattern with two rarefaction waves separated by vacuum ; this is a very rare physical configuration which can not be handled by a generic numerical code .",
    "note that in computing ( [ capo3 ] ) , both the left state quantities and the right ones are involved and , as a result , @xmath139 will depend on both @xmath120 and @xmath135 .",
    "this property will be important in the subsequent discussion in section  [ effect ] .",
    "[ fig0 ] shows the functional behaviour of @xmath143 and how this behaviour is changed by the presence of nonzero tangential velocities .",
    "the initial conditions are those of a modified sod s problem ( sod , 1978 ) in which @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 .",
    "each of the two curves shown is effectively the composition of three different ones ( joined at the solid dots ) corresponding to wave - patterns consisting of two shock waves ( @xmath151 ) , one shock and one rarefaction wave ( @xmath44 ) , and two rarefaction waves ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "while the solid curve refers to initial conditions with zero tangential velocities , the dashed one is produced when nonzero tangential velocities , @xmath152 , are considered .",
    "note that also in this latter case , the three branches are monotonically increasing with @xmath109 ( a fundamental property whose mathematical proof can be found in appendix a ) but are all altered by the presence of nonzero tangential velocities .",
    "the consequences of this will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the changes in the functional behaviour of @xmath143 introduced by nonzero initial tangential velocities suggest that new qualitative differences could be found in a relativistic multidimensional riemann problem .",
    "this was first discussed in a recent paper ( rezzolla & zanotti 2002 ) where the basic features of new relativistic effects were briefly pointed out .",
    "this section is dedicated to a more detailed discussion of how the changes in the functional behaviour of @xmath143 are responsible for relativistic effects in the dynamics of nonlinear waves . before entering in the heart of the discussion , however",
    ", it is useful to remind that in newtonian hydrodynamics a multidimensional riemann problem does not depend on the values of the tangential velocities in the two initial states .",
    "rather , different wave - patterns can be produced only after a suitable change in either the normal velocity , the rest - mass density or the pressure .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that tangential velocities are not changed across newtonian nonlinear waves . in relativistic hydrodynamics , on the other hand ,",
    "this is not the case and is at the origin of the effects discussed below .    -1.0",
    "cm    let us restrict our attention to a situation in which the tangential velocity of only one of the two initial states is varied .",

    "[ fig4 ] and  [ fig6 ] , presenting numerical values for all of the relevant quantities in the riemann problem when different combinations of the tangential velocities are used .    to gain a better insight in these effects",
    "it can be instructive to consider how the velocities at which the various nonlinear waves propagate in the unperturbed media change when the tangential velocities @xmath153 and @xmath154 are varied separately .",
    "this information is contained in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] in which different curves show the behaviour of the head and tail of a left - propagating rarefaction wave ( i.e. @xmath179 , @xmath180 ) , of the head and tail of a right - propagating rarefaction wave ( i.e. @xmath181 , @xmath182 ) , and of a left or a right - propagating shock wave ( i.e. @xmath183 , @xmath184 ) .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , in particular , shows the transition from a @xmath44 to a @xmath151 wave - pattern with the dotted line marking the value of @xmath154 at which this occurs .",
    "similarly , the right panel shows the transition from a @xmath44 to a @xmath45 wave - pattern and the dotted line is again used to mark the value of @xmath153 distinguishing the two regions of the parameter space . a number of interesting features can be noted and some of these were pointed out also by pons _",
    "et al _ ( 2000 ) .",
    "firstly , the speed of the head of a rarefaction wave propagating towards a region of constant tangential velocity is constant , or , stated it differently , @xmath180 does not depend on @xmath154 .",
    "secondly , the velocity of the waves converges to zero if they propagate in regions with increasingly large tangential velocities .",
    "thirdly , the values of @xmath92 at which the speeds of the head and tail of the rarefaction wave coincide , mark the transition from one wave - pattern to another and are indicated with vertical dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "-1.0 cm    as mentioned before , the appearance of these new relativistic effects is related to the behaviour of the function @xmath143 for different values of the initial tangential velocities and in particular to how the three branches composing the curve change under variation of @xmath185 . as a result , the occurrence of these effects can be recast into the study of the dependence of @xmath186 and @xmath46 on the tangential velocities .",
    "using expressions ( [ capo1 ] ) , ( [ capo2_analytic ] ) , and ( [ capo3 ] ) , this dependence can be summarised as follows @xmath187 and can be best studied by considering the limits of @xmath186 and @xmath46 when @xmath188 . in the case of a @xmath151 wave - pattern ,",
    "expression ( [ capo1 ] ) simply indicates that @xmath189 this result is also shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the right solid dot converges to zero as @xmath190 , while the left one does not vary .",
    "the limit ( [ cond_a ] ) can also be used to deduce that for any @xmath191 , there exists a value @xmath192 of @xmath193 such that @xmath194 a direct consequence of ( [ cond_ab ] ) is that given a riemann problem having initial state vectors with positive relative normal - velocity and producing a @xmath44 wave - pattern , it is always possible to transform it into a @xmath151 wave - pattern by increasing the value of the initial tangential velocity in the state of initial lower pressure .    in the case of a @xmath44 wave - pattern",
    "we refer to ( [ capo2_analytic ] ) to notice that in the limit of @xmath195 the integrand vanishes ( @xmath196 ) and therefore : @xmath197 as for the previous one , the limit ( [ cond_b ] ) can be deduced from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the left solid dot converges to zero as @xmath198 , while the right one does not vary .",
    "also in this case the limit ( [ cond_b ] ) can be used to conclude that for any @xmath199 , there exists a value @xmath200 of @xmath201 such that @xmath202 and therefore causing an initial @xmath44 wave - pattern solution to become a @xmath45 one as a consequence of an increased tangential velocity in the state of initial higher pressure nor for @xmath200 . ] .",
    "overall , expressions ( [ cond_a ] ) and ( [ cond_b ] ) indicate that for tangential velocities assuming increasingly larger values , the @xmath44 branch of the @xmath58 curve spans a progressively smaller interval of relative normal - velocities .",
    "when the tangential velocities reach their asymptotic values , the @xmath44 branch reduces to a point . in practice",
    ", therefore , the main effect introduced by relativistic tangential velocities in a riemann problem is that of disfavouring the occurrence of a wave - pattern consisting of a shock and a rarefaction wave .    for completeness",
    "we also report the limit of the relative normal - velocity marking the branch of two rarefaction waves separated by vacuum . in this case",
    ", the limit is taken for both @xmath201 and @xmath193 tending to infinity , and using ( [ capo3_a])-([capo3_b ] ) yields @xmath203 because the effects discussed in this section have a purely special relativistic origin they might conflict with our physical intuition , especially when the latter is based on the knowledge of the riemann problem in newtonian hydrodynamics . however , the behaviour reported here is typical of those special relativistic phenomena involving lorentz factors including also tangential velocities .",
    "a useful example in this respect is offered by the relativistic transverse - doppler effect , in which the wavelength of a photon received from a source moving at relativistic speeds changes also if the source has a velocity component orthogonal to the direction of emission of the photon ( rindler , 1980 ) . in this case too , a lorentz factor including the transverse velocity is responsible for the effect .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that there exists a set of initial conditions for which these new relativistic effects can not occur .",
    "these initial conditions are those in which @xmath204 as in the classic `` shock - tube '' problem , where @xmath205 . in this case , in fact , @xmath206 and , because of the limits ( [ cond_a ] ) and ( [ cond_b ] ) , the solution of the riemann problem will be given by a wave - pattern consisting of a shock and a rarefaction wave , independently of the values of the tangential velocities .",
    "we have shown that and efficient solution of the exact riemann problem in multidimensional relativistic flows can be obtained after exploiting the properties of the invariant expression for the relative normal - velocity between the two initial states .",
    "the new procedure proposed here is the natural extension of a similar method presented for the exact solution of the riemann problem in one - dimensional relativistic flows ( rezzolla & zanotti , 2001 ) .",
    "using information contained in the initial state vectors , this approach predicts the wave - pattern that will be produced in the riemann problem , determines the set of equations to be solved and brackets the interval in pressure where the solution should be sought . because logically straightforward , this approach results into an algorithm which is very easy to implement numerically and work is now in progress to assess the computational speedup in multidimensional codes .",
    "an important aspect of this strategy is that it naturally points out relativistic effects that can take place whenever the initial relative velocity normal to the initial surface of discontinuity is nonzero .",
    "when this is the case , in fact , the tangential velocities can affect the solution of the riemann problem and cause a transition from one wave - pattern to another one . more specifically , by varying the tangential velocities on either side of the initial discontinuity while keeping the remaining state vectors unchanged , the nonlinear waves involved in the solution riemann problem can change from rarefaction waves to shock waves and vice - versa .",
    "these effects have a purely relativistic nature , do not have a newtonian counterpart and could be relevant in several astrophysical scenarios , such as those involving relativistic jets or @xmath207ray bursts , in which nonlinear hydrodynamical waves with large lorentz factors and complex multidimensional flows are expected ( blandford 2002 , meszaros 2002 ) .    as a final remark it is worth pointing out that while the content of this paper is focussed on special relativistic hydrodynamics and flat spacetimes , the local lorentz invariance allows to extend the results discussed here also to curved spacetimes and general relativistic numerical calculations ( pons _ et al _ 1998 , and font 2000 for a review ) .      with our choice of considering the initial left state as the one with highest pressure",
    ", the proof of monotonicity will be obtained if we show that @xmath58 is a monotonically _ increasing _ function of @xmath36 .",
    "indicating then with a @xmath208 the first derivative with respect to @xmath36 and dropping the upper index @xmath12 in the notation for the normal velocities , it is straightforward to derive that the first derivative of expression ( [ g_vrel ] ) is given by @xmath209 a rapid look at expression ( [ d_vrel ] ) suggests that the proof that @xmath58 is monotonically increasing will follow if it can be shown that @xmath210 and @xmath211 are both positive . on the other hand ,",
    "using equations ( [ 1c ] ) and ( [ 2c ] ) , the proof of the monotonicity will follow from showing that @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "while these inequalities must hold irrespectively of the nonlinear wave considered , the proofs will be different for the different waves considered .    in the case when a rarefaction wave is present , the proof is indeed straightforward . according to ( [ v_b_r ] ) and",
    "( [ o_m_xiv ] ) , in fact , @xmath214 across the rarefaction wave is negative when the rarefaction wave propagates towards the left [ implying that @xmath215 is negative ] and it is positive when the rarefaction wave propagates towards the right [ implying that @xmath216 is positive ] .",
    "if a shock wave is present , on the other hand , a proof for the most general case and in terms of simple algebraic relations and can not be given .",
    "on the other hand , a rather simple analytic proof can be found in the simpler case in which @xmath217 ; while this is certainly not the most general case , numerical calculations have shown that the result holds in general . consider therefore a shock wave propagating towards the left ; after lengthy but straightforward calculations it is possible to show that @xmath218 ^ 2 } \\ , \\ ] ] where we have set @xmath219 and @xmath220 , and where @xmath6 is the pressure behind the shock .",

    "because the right hand side of ( [ cond3 ] ) is always positive for any @xmath227 , the condition for monotonicity ( [ cond3 ] ) will be satisfied if its left hand side is negative , i.e. if @xmath228 at this point the proof can be continued graphically and making use of the taub adiabat . in the plane @xmath229 ,",
    "in fact , the taub adiabat ( [ taub2 ] ) selects the points solutions of the hydrodynamical equations across a shock wave , therefore connecting the state ahead of the shock front with the one behind it . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , this curve is indicated with a solid line and we have indicated with the points a and b the states ahead ( region 1 ) and behind ( region 3 ) the shock front .",
    "once an initial state a has been chosen , the mass flux will determine the point b of the taub adiabat solution of the rankine - hugoniot relations . because of this , the slope of the chord connecting the point a with b ( shown as a dotted line in fig .",

    "[ fig8 ] , the slope of the chord ab is always larger than the corresponding slope for the chord ab , thus stating that the condition ( [ cond3 ] ) is indeed verified and that @xmath216 is therefore positive .    in this appendix",
