    "the motion of a particle in one dimension under the action of a conservative force is described by the simple equation @xmath0 , where the force @xmath1 depends on the amplitude of the motion @xmath2 and one or more parameters . for such conservative systems the total energy @xmath3 ,",
    "is conserved . while a complete description of the motion can be obtained from the analysis of phase space , an explicit analytic expression for the period of oscillations around equilibria",
    "is not always available . for linear problems the period does not depend on the amplitude of the motion , but when nonlinearities are present , even though we know the expression for the period , namely @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are turning points , the integral can not be evaluated analytically except for special nonlinear potentials @xmath7 .",
    "the usual procedure in such cases is to consider the nonlinearities as small perturbations to the linear problem and to obtain a series expansion for the period of oscillation . to obtain a close estimate of the period at large amplitude",
    ", the perturbation expansion must be carried to high orders .",
    "often the series may be divergent . recently a method to obtain a rapidly convergent series has been developed @xcite , based on kleinert s variational perturbation theory ( see chapter 5 of @xcite ) .    in previous work",
    "we studied a nonlinear eigenvalue problem , of which the above problem constitutes a particular case , and showed that the eigenvalue ( the period in the present case ) can be obtained from an integral variational principle . from it , we obtained arbitrarily accurate upper bounds on the period , valid at all amplitudes , without resource to perturbation theory .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to show the existence of a dual variational principle from which lower bounds are obtained , thus providing a complete variational characterization of the period .",
    "we consider systems with an equilibrium point @xmath8 , and will study the period of oscillations around this equilibrium .",
    "moreover , for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the force is an odd function of @xmath2",
    ". the results can be generalized in a simple way to a general force term .",
    "if the force is odd , the period can be evaluated by considering the motion through a quarter of a period .",
    "chosing the quarter period in the quadrant @xmath9 of phase space , the period may be calculated solving @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "notice that the eigenvalue @xmath15 depends on the amplitude @xmath19 .    in previous work we proved that the eigenvalue @xmath15 is characterized by the variational principle @xmath20 = \\max_g \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac { \\left ( \\int_0^{u_m } { g'}^{1/3}(u ) d",

    "the maximum is achieved for @xmath24 which satisfies @xmath25 an application of this result to the duffing equation yielded a simple approximate formula as a close upper bound for the frequency @xmath26 . in the following",

    "the two variational principles give a complete characterization of the eigenvalue problem . in section 2",
    "we give the complete variational characterization of the period . in section 3",
    "we apply the variational principle and its dual to estimate the period of the duffing oscillator .",
    "many authors have considered the following two point boundary value problem @xmath27 with @xmath28 here @xmath29 is positive and continuous but not necessarily @xmath30 when @xmath31 . for example , this type of nonlinear two point boundary value problem arises in the study of heat generation and stability of temperature distribution of conducting plates @xcite . under the assumption that @xmath32 is positive and continuous ,",

    "moreau duality , @xmath72,\\ ] ] and the theorem follows from here .",
    "to illustrate our variational principle and its dual , we will consider as an example the duffing oscillator .",
    "consider the two point boundary value problem @xmath73 on the interval @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "denote by @xmath77 the sup  norm of the solution .",
    "we are only interested in the principal branch @xmath78 , i.e. , in the positive solution . in terms of @xmath15 , the period of the oscillator",
    "is given by @xmath79 .",
    "for this simple example one can compute the period of the oscillator in closed form in terms of complete elliptic integrals .",
    "however , since our purpose here is to illustrate the use of the dual variational principles , we will use simple trial functions in theorems 1 and 2 above to compute upper and lower bounds on the period of the duffing oscillator .",
    "there is a vast literature on the duffing oscillator , and the use of perturbative schemes to obtain the period of the oscilator ( see e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "most perturbative schemes yield divergent asymptotic series for the period which can , however , be converted into exponentially fast convergent series by kleinert s variational perturbation theory @xcite .    to begin with ,",
    "we use theorem 1 to get a lower bound on @xmath15 . as we pointed out in @xcite , a good trial function",
    "is given by @xmath80 which is certainly in @xmath81 .",
    "this trial function will yield a lower bound on @xmath15 which gives an excellent agreement with the exact value of @xmath15 near the bifurcation point @xmath82 . in fact , as it was illustrated in @xcite it gives a good agreement for all values of the amplitude @xmath83 . from ( [ eq:3.1 ] )",
    "we get @xmath84 using this trial function @xmath45 in theorem 1 , yields the lower bound @xmath85 if we denote by @xmath86 , the above bound gives the following upper bound on @xmath87 for the duffing oscillator , @xmath88 we now proceed to compute upper bounds on @xmath15 ( i.e. , lower bounds on @xmath87 ) using the dual principle given by theorem 2 . for the duffing oscillator , @xmath89 , and therefore @xmath90 .",
    "hence , we can write @xmath91 where @xmath92 in order to get simple , computable , bounds using the variational principle given by theorem 2 , it is convenient to express the trial function @xmath93 in terms of a new variable , @xmath94 , through the following relation , @xmath95 different approximations ( i.e. , different upper bounds on @xmath15 ) are obtained by choosing different expressions for the trial function @xmath94 . the simplest way to get computable bounds to different degree of accuracy is to use as trial @xmath94 the taylor expansion of @xmath96 truncated to any even power . in the sequel",
    "we give the details for the first nontrivial truncation .",
    "better approximations can be obtained in the same way .",
    "choosing @xmath97 ( which corresponds to the taylor expansion of @xmath96 truncated to second order ) , yields @xmath98 which is nonnegative , and therefore belongs to @xmath99 . denoting by @xmath100 and @xmath101 then , @xmath102 and @xmath103    in figure 1 , we plot the exact value ( solid line ) of @xmath104 for the duffing oscilator as well as the upper bound ( [ eq:3.5 ] ) and the lower bound ( [ eq:3.12 ] ) .",
    "the upper bound is an excellent approximation for @xmath87 for all amplitudes , whereas more complicated trial functions have to be used to get better lower bounds on @xmath87 . in the figure",
    "we also include the lower bounds obtained by truncating @xmath96 to degree @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 as a function of @xmath109 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that all these lower bounds are precisely the curves for @xmath87 obtained by standard perturbation theory .",
