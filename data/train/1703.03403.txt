    "appearing a scalar field in the low energy limit of string theory has motivated various scientists to study dilaton gravity with different viewpoints .",
    "the coupling of dilaton with other gauge fields has a profound effects on the resulting solutions koikaway , gibbonsm , brillh , garfinklehs , gregoryh , hor2 .",
    "for example , it was shown that the dilaton field can change the asymptotic behavior of the spacetime .",
    "in particular , it was argued that in the presence of one or two liouville - type dilaton potentials , black hole spacetimes are neither asymptotically flat nor ( anti)-de sitter ( ( a)ds ) ( see mignemiw , polettiw , polettitw , chm , cai , clem , sheykhi0,dehghaniph , hendimath and references therein ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dilaton field does not vanish for @xmath0 .",
    "latter , it was shown that with combination of three liouville type dilaton potentials , it is possible to construct dilatonic black hole solutions in the background of ( a)ds spacetime @xcite .",
    "recently , studies on compact objects such as neutron stars in the context of dilaton gravity hendiben , fiziev as well as black objects in dilaton gravity s rainbow have been carried out @xcite .",
    "on the other side , one of the important solutions of einstein s field equation is three dimensional black holes .",
    "the first three dimensional black hole solution was found by banados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz ) @xcite , and afterwards , btz black holes have got a lot of attentions btz2,btz3,emparan , hemming , sahoo , setare , cadoni , park , parsonsr , birminghamms , akbar , myungkm , hodgkinsonl , moonm , frodden , euneky , lemosq , bravo , setarea , hosseini , wulz , soroushfar . the motivation to study",
    "three dimensional solutions originates from the fact that near horizon geometry of these solutions serves as a worthwhile model to investigate some conceptual questions of ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "also , studying the btz black hole has improved our knowledge of gravitational systems and their interactions in 3-dimensions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , possible existence of gravitational aharonov - bohm effect due to the noncommutative btz black holes anacletob , and specific relations between these black holes and effective action in string theory have been explored witten , larranagai , larranagaii . from the viewpoint of quantum theory of gravity , three dimensional gravity plays an important role .",
    "entanglement , quantum entropy @xcite , holography and holographical superconductors of the btz black holes have been studied in refs .",
    "germani , liupw , de la fuente , chaturvedi , ziogas , dehyadegari .    the studies on the btz black holes / wormholes were also extended to include the dilaton field @xcite , the nonlinear electrodynamics btznon , yamazaki , hendijhep , hendiepjcthree , and higher dimensional spacetimes @xcite .",
    "also , btz black holes in the presence of massive gravity with maxwell and born - infeld fields have been studied in ref .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the electric field of btz - like solutions in higher - dimensions are the same as three dimensions and they are thermally stable in the whole phase space btzlikei , btzlikeii . in @xcite , thermodynamical stability of static uncharged btz dilaton black holes in the canonical ensemble was explored .",
    "it was shown that depending on the dilaton coupling constant , @xmath1 , the solution can exhibit a stable phase .",
    "indeed , it was observed that the system is thermally stable / unstable for specific values of the dilaton parameter .",
    "on the other hand , gravity coupled with the nonlinear electrodynamics attracts significant attentions because of its specific properties in gauge / gravity coupling .",
    "interesting physical properties of various nonlinear electrodynamic models have been studied in many papers hendijhep , hendiepjcthree , btzlikei , btzlikeii , btzmassive , born , soleng , yajima , delphenich , stefanov , gonzalez , miskovic , diaz - alonso , mazharimousavi , kruglov , hendiepjhep .",
    "one of the interesting branches of the nonlinear electrodynamic models is related to power maxwell invariant ( pmi ) theory in which its lagrangian is an arbitrary power of maxwell lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the pmi theory has more interesting properties with regard to the maxwell field , and for unit power it reduces to linear case ( maxwell theory ) .",
    "one of the attractive properties of this theory is related to the possible conformal invariancy .",
    "it is notable that , when the power of maxwell invariant is a quarter of spacetime dimensions ( @xmath2 ) , this theory enjoys the conformal invariancy . in other words , by considering power of maxwell invariant equal to @xmath3 , one can obtain a traceless energy - momentum tensor which leads to an invariant theory under conformal transformation .",
    "it is notable that , considering this conformal symmetry , we can construct charged black hole with an inverse square electric field in arbitrary dimensions which is analogue to the four - dimensional reissner - nordestrm solutions @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the btz black holes in dilaton and dilaton gravity s rainbow have been investigated in refs .",
    "thus it is well motivated to consider the three dimensional dilatonic black holes in the presence of different gauge fields . since exact solutions of charged dilatonic black holes",
    "have not been investigate before , in the present work , one of our goals is obtaining an exact solution of three dimensional dilatonic black holes by adding the pmi electrodynamics to the action .",
    "in addition , we try to study interesting properties of such exact solution as a thermodynamical system .",
    "one of the interesting methods for studying properties of thermodynamical systems is through geometrical thermodynamics .",
    "this method employs riemannian geometry to construct phase space .",
    "the information regarding thermodynamical behavior of a system could be extracted from the ricci scalar of this phase space .",
    "divergencies of the ricci scalar determine two sets of important points : bound points which separate situations with positive temperature from those with negative temperature , and phase transition points which represent discontinuities in thermodynamical quantities such as the heat capacity .",
    "in addition , considering the sign of ricci scalar around its divergencies , it is possible to determine whether the interaction around divergencies are of repulsive or attractive nature @xcite .",
    "the first geometrical thermodynamical approach was introduced by weinhold which is based on internal energy as thermodynamical potential weinholdi , weinholdii .",
    "latter , an alternative was proposed by ruppeiner which has entropy as its thermodynamical potential ruppeineri , ruppeinerii .",
    "another proposal for the geometrical thermodynamics was given by quevedo which has legendre invariancy as its core stone @xcite .",
    "mentioned methods have been used in studying thermodynamics of the black holes hanc , bravettimma , ma , garciamc , zhangcy , molw2016,sanchez , soroushfar1,hendinaderi . in a series of papers",
    ", it was shown that the mentioned methods may confront specific problems in describing thermodynamical properties of the black holes @xcite .",
    "in other words , there were cases in which , the results of these three approaches were not consistent with those extracted from other methods . in order to remove the shortcomings of other methods regarding geometrical thermodynamics ,",
    "a new thermodynamical metric was introduced by hendi , panahiyan , eslam panah and momennia ( hpem ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown that employing this method leads to consistent results regarding thermodynamical properties of the black holes . for a comparative study regarding these four thermodynamical metrics ,",
    "we refer the readers to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows . in the next section",

    "we calculate conserved and thermodynamic quantities of obtained solutions and examine the validity of the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "thermodynamical behavior of the solutions and the properties governing it are explored in different contexts in sections [ tb ] and [ gt ] .",
    "the paper is concluded in section [ con ] with some closing remarks .",
    "in this section , we obtain three dimensional charged dilatonic black hole solutions in the presence of pmi field . for this purpose , we consider a @xmath4dimensional action of einstein gravity which is coupled with dilaton and pmi fields @xmath5 ,   \\label{action}\\]]where @xmath6 is the ricci scalar , @xmath7 is the dilaton field and @xmath8 is a dilatonic potential . also , @xmath9 is the maxwell invariant , in which @xmath10 is the faraday tensor with the electromagnetic potential @xmath11 and @xmath12 the power of nonlinearity .",
    "in addition , it should be pointed out that @xmath1 is a constant which determines the strength of coupling of the scalar and electromagnetic field .    using variational principle and varying eq .",

    "since we are looking for the black holes with a radial electric field ( @xmath22 ) , the electromagnetic potential will be in the following form @xmath23    using eqs .",

    "the motivation for considering such an ansatz is due to black string solutions of einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity which was first introduced in ref .",
    "the @xmath31  is obtained @xmath32where @xmath33  is an arbitrary constant and @xmath34  ( @xmath35 ) .    here , in order to find consistent metric functions , we use a modified version of liouville - type dilaton potential @xmath36where @xmath37  is a free parameter which plays the role of cosmological constant , @xmath38  and @xmath39  are arbitrary constants .",

    "it is notable that , the above solutions ( eqs .

    "it is notable that , for @xmath50(@xmath51 , in which @xmath52 denote dimensions ) , this solution ( eq .",
    "( [ pmi3 ] ) ) reduce to conformally invariant maxwell black hole solutions , as expected @xcite .    in order to confirm the black hole interpretation of the solutions , we look for the curvature singularity . to do so",
    ", we calculate the kretschmann scalar .",
    "calculations show that for finite values of radial coordinate , the kretschmann scalar is finite . on the other hand , for very small and very large values of @xmath27 , we obtain @xmath53    the equation ( [ rr0 ] ) confirms that there is an essential singularity located at @xmath54 , while eq .",
    "( [ rrinf ] ) shows that for nonzero @xmath1 , the asymptotical behavior of solutions is not ( a)ds .",
    "it is easy to show that the metric function may contain real positive roots ( see fig .",

    "( mass ) reduces to the mass of charged btz black holes @xcite .",
    "now , we are in a position to check the validity of first law of thermodynamics .",
    "to do so , first , we calculate the geometrical mass , @xmath41 , by using @xmath62 . then by employing the obtained geometrical mass , we rewrite the mass relation , eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) , in the following form @xmath63    it is a matter of calculation to show that @xmath64    therefore , it is proved that the first law is valid as @xmath65",
    "in usual black holes thermodynamics , the mass of black hole is interpreted as internal energy . in classical black hole thermodynamics , it is necessary to have positive value for internal energy of the system , hence , the mass of black holes .",
    "therefore , in this section we will study the conditions which are determining the positivity and negativity of this conserved quantity .",
    "the mass of these black holes ( [ mass2 ] ) is constructed by two terms .",
    "the first term of eq .",
    "( [ mass2 ] ) is related to dilatonic gravity , and the second term includes a combination of electromagnetic and dilatonic parameters .",
    "the positivity of first term is determined by @xmath66 .",
    "the second term has two specific parts which determine the positivity and negativity of it .",
    "these terms are @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in order for the second term",
    "has positive effects on the total mass of black holes , the following conditions should be satisfied simultaneously    @xmath69    the existence of mentioned conditions for positivity and negativity of the mass indicates that under certain circumstances ( suitable choices of different parameters ) , it is possible for the mass of black holes to be ; completely negative / positive or a root may exist for the mass of black holes which results into existence of two regions of negative and positive mass for black holes .",
    "we see that the positivity / negativity of first term of eq .",
    "( [ mass2 ] ) only depends on dilatonic gravity while for the second term of eq .",
    "( [ mass2 ] ) , due to the coupling of dilatonic gravity and electromagnetic field in the action , it depends on nonlinearity and dilatonic parameters .      now , we focus on the behavior of temperature . thermodynamically speaking , for black holes ,",
    "existence of negative temperature indicates non - physical systems , while , positive temperature is denoted as systems being physical . in other words , negativity and positivity of the temperature",
    "confirm whether obtained solutions for black holes are physical or non - physical ones . here",
    ", the temperature of these black holes ( [ temp ] ) contains two terms ; @xmath70 term which is purely due to the dilatonic part of action and electric charge term which is a combination of dilatonic parameter and electric charge .",
    "the total contribution of @xmath71 term depends on the choices of @xmath37 itself .",
    "if @xmath72 , the contribution of this term will be towards the negativity whereas for @xmath73 , this term will have positive effects on values of temperature .",
    "as for the charge term , its effects are determined by two factors which are @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "considering our earlier discussions , ( @xmath76 ) , one can automatically conclude that the contributions of this term is positive .",
    "therefore , the negativity or positivity of charge term only depends on the sign of @xmath77 .",
    "meaning that for @xmath78the charge term will be positive and its effects are toward positivity of the temperature , whereas the opposite is observed for violation of this condition .",
    "the above condition presents the direct interaction of electromagnetic and dilatonic fields in an elegant way .",
    "we see that the coupling of electromagnetic field and dilaton gravity results into specific contribution in thermodynamical structure of the solutions and presents a tool for tuning the effects of dilaton gravity and electromagnetic field for specific purposes .",
    "returning to temperature , interestingly , we notice that in @xmath37 term , the power of event horizon only depends on dilatonic parameter whereas in charge term , it only depends on nonlinearity parameter , @xmath12 . here",
    ", we see that regardless of the coupling between electromagnetic field and dilatonic gravity , the power of horizon radius has been separated into two groups depending on different parts of the action .",
    "thermodynamically speaking , the effectiveness of horizon radius has been separated into two branches which depends on the choices of dilatonic and nonlinearity parameters .",
    "the structure of action introduced such property into thermodynamical structure of the black holes .",
    "therefore , it is possible to modify the effect of horizon radius in one branch ( whether electromagnetic part or dilatonic gravity ) without any concern regarding the other part .",
    "now , we study the positivity / negativity of heat capacity .",
    "the heat capacity has specific information regarding the stability / instability of system and phase transitions .",
    "the phase transitions usually take place when system is in an unstable state . in other words ,",
    "unstable systems go under a phase transition to acquire stability .",
    "the phase transition in heat capacity are recognized when the heat capacity meets a discontinuity , hence divergency . in other words , divergencies of the heat capacity",
    "are where systems go under phase transitions . the thermal stability / instability of the system",
    "is determined by the sign of heat capacity ; the negative values are representing the system being in unstable state while the positivity of the heat capacity is denoted as system being thermally stable .",
    "the heat capacity is given by @xmath79where by using the first law of black holes thermodynamics , one can rewrite it as    @xmath80    using this relation , it is possible to extract two thermodynamical important points ; bound and phase transition points .",
    "@xmath81    the bound point is where the heat capacity , hence temperature , meets a root .",
    "since this point separates physical ( positive temperature ) form non - physical ( negative temperature ) solutions , it is called bound point . using the obtained temperature ( [ temp ] ) and entropy ( [ entropy ] )",

    "if @xmath88 is even , then the existence of positive real valued root and phase transition point for these black holes is restricted to the following inequalities being satisfied    @xmath89which once more , highlight the interaction between dilaton and electromagnetic fields .    in order to elaborate the effects of different parameters on thermodynamical behavior of the mass , temperature and heat capacity",

    "the region of stability for this case is located between a bound and divergence point , whereas after the divergency , black holes are within physical region ( positive temperature and mass ) but are unstable ( see up panel of fig .",

    "this indicates that there exists a region where internal energy of the system is negative .",

    "the divergencies of ricci scalar in the phase space marks two important points : bound and phase transition points .",
    "in other words , divergencies ( phase transition points ) and bound points of the thermodynamical systems coincide with the divergencies of ricci scalar .",

    "the positive sign indicates that system has repulsive interaction whereas the opposite could be said about negative sign . here",
    ", we see that before the bound point , system has attractive property and by crossing the bound point , the interaction is changed into repulsive . on the other hand , for the phase transition point , the sign of ricci scalar is positive .",
    "therefore , here , system has repulsive interaction on fundamental level .",
    "also , we see that employing the geometrical thermodynamics provides us with extra information regarding the nature of interactions around the bound and phase transition points . these information could not be extracted by using the temperature and heat capacity of a system .",
    "we studied three dimensional dilatonic black holes in the presence of a nonlinear electromagnetic field known as power maxwell invariant .",
    "it was shown that the solutions have interpretation of the black holes . conserved and thermodynamical",
    "quantities of these solutions were extracted and it was shown that the first law of black holes thermodynamics is satisfied .",
    "it was shown that it is possible to obtain roots for the mass of black holes which led to the presence of region where the mass of black holes was negative .",
    "this shows that in order to have a better picture regarding thermodynamical structure of the black holes , it is necessary to include the behavior of mass as well .",
    "there are specific restrictions which are imposed by thermodynamical behavior of the mass which could not be neglected and must be taken into account for having reliable conclusions and predictions regarding thermodynamics of the black holes .",
    "for the past decades , the studies regarding thermodynamical structures of the black holes have neglected this important and crucial factor .",
    "considering that we are using thermodynamics of the black holes in ads spacetime for applications in conformal field theory , the restrictions which are imposed by mass of the black holes become highly important .",
    "in addition , the effects of different parameters on thermodynamical structures and phase transitions of these black holes were investigated .",
    "it was shown that the existence of phase transition is depending on the values of different parameters .    next",
    ", geometrical thermodynamics was employed to study thermodynamical structure of these black holes .",
    "it was shown that for these specific black holes , using weinhold , ruppeiner and quevedo methods lead to inconsistent results regarding the bound and phase transition points , whereas , hpem approach was successful in describing thermodynamical properties of these black holes . furthermore , we employed the sign of hpem metric around the bound and phase transition point to study repulsiveness and attractiveness of the interactions .    finally , it is worthwhile to generalize the obtained results to the case of non - abelian yang - mills field .",
    "in addition , it will be interesting to study causal structure of the solutions and examine the possibility of closed timelike curves in the special case of dilaton and nonlinearity parameters .",
    "furthermore , one may pay attention to the possibility of having three dimensional hairy black holes in the context of massive gravity .",
    "we will address these subjects in the future works ."
