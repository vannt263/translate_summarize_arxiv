    "to define various versions of lattice qcd ( lqcd ) , one usually follows a standard route where the gauge part of the total continuum action is treated independently from the part involving fermions .",

    "it remains to be seen if one can gain theoretical or computational advantage by introducing interrelations of this type into the lattice  regularized theory .",
    "the validity of various coherent versions of lqcd hinges on conjectures of _ locality _ and proper _ classical limit _ for scalar and pseudoscalar gauge densities associated with operator functions @xmath6 used in the construction . if @xmath0 is a ginsparg  wilson operator , which we assume from now on , then these are expected to be technically non  trivial issues due to the fact that @xmath0 is necessarily a non  ultralocal operator in fermionic variables  @xcite , and its dependence on gauge degrees of freedom is also expected to be generically non  ultralocal .    in this paper",

( [ eq:3.46 ] ) ) we can immediately see the following correspondence @xmath199        \\label{eq:4.14}\\ ] ] where the superscripts _ `` inf '' _ and _ `` fin '' _ refer to infinite and finite volume cases respectively . in other words ,",
    "the matrix @xmath200 ( for finite volume setups discussed here ) is equal to the corresponding riemann sum ( with @xmath140 terms ) for the inverse fourier transform representation of @xmath201 .",
    "the same constant background is of course implicitly assumed in both cases .    _",
    "( iv ) _ riemann sums in question converge exponentially in @xmath145 , as emphasized in previous sections , and we can conclude from ( [ eq:4.14 ] ) that for large @xmath145 @xmath202 with strictly positive @xmath203 ( also at @xmath204 ) .    from the last equation it follows that , in the case of constant background fields , the taylor expansion ( in @xmath30 ) of @xmath103 in infinite volume supplies an asymptotic expansion for the case of finite volume ( with corections behaving as @xmath205 . moreover , considering the continuum limit at fixed @xmath191 ( so that @xmath206 ) we obtain that @xmath207 where @xmath19 is the constant that we computed in the infinite volume .",
