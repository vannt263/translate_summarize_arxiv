    "the electron - positron annihilation process is one of the basic hard scattering processes where the composite structure of hadrons is investigated . especially , the two hadron production in inclusive @xmath2 annihilation ( thpia ) , _ i.e. _ the process in which two hadrons are detected in the final state , attracts a lot of attention due to the possibility for both the experimental and theoretical studies of several fragmentation functions , in particular the chiral - odd collins functions @xcite-@xcite . since available experimental data @xcite correspond to substantially different values of @xmath3 ,",
    "taking into account the evolution of fragmentation ( in particular , collins ) functions becomes an important theoretical task . in turn",
    ", the studies of evolution are intimately correlated to the investigation of qcd factorization .",
    "however , it is well - known that the factorization theorems do not hold for an arbitrary kinematic regime . indeed ,",
    "if a transverse momentum of the produced hadron is of the same order of magnitude as the large photon virtuality , @xmath4 , the corresponding hadronic tensor can be factorized and expressed in terms of the integrated fragmentation functions ( see , for instance , a detailed analysis of @xmath0 annihilation in @xcite ) . even if @xmath5 is much smaller than the large photon virtuality , but on the other hand , is much bigger than the characteristic hadronic size , @xmath6 , factorization of the @xmath0 annihilation cross section can still be proven with methods similar to those used for semi - inclusive dis or drell - yan processes @xcite . however , the regime for which the transverse momentum of produced hadron is of the order of @xmath6 faces a conceptual problem how to identify the hard subprocess .",
    "therefore , factorization becomes vague and requires a special care @xcite .",
    "factorization in thpia , starting from the seminal paper @xcite , was only studied in the collinear approximation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "besides , the procedure of integration over the transverse virtual photon momentum ( see @xcite ) was restricted to born approximation .    since the transverse momentum is of crucial importance for the collins function , we perform a detailed analysis of its role in thpia .",
    "we use ideas of @xcite where it was shown that integration over the transverse momentum of a produced @xmath7 pair or a hadron in the drell - yan process provides an effective propagator of a highly virtual photon and generates the hard subprocess structure . this approach was recently generalized @xcite to include the case of the ( weighted ) transverse momentum average of semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) with transverse momentum dependent fragmentation functions .    in this paper , we develop these ideas further and present a new method of factorization which may be applied for any two - current process . in particular , we demonstrate the application of the method in the case of @xmath0 annihilation when two hadrons , belonging to different back - to - back jets , are produced .    to demonstrate the method we are proposing , we consider , at the first stage , the simplest case of the spin - independent @xmath8-integrated fragmentation functions .",
    "we analyze contributions up to leading order @xmath1 corrections to the hard part to obtain the evolutions of the corresponding fragmentation functions .",
    "also , we briefly outline a way to extend our approach for the study of the collins effects .",
    "we consider the process @xmath9 where positron and electron carrying momenta @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , annihilate into a time - like photon with momentum @xmath12 for which @xmath13 is large .",
    "this time - like photon creates then two outgoing hadrons with momenta @xmath14 ( these hadrons belong to two distinct jets ) and an undetected bunch of hadrons with total momentum @xmath15 . for such kind of a process , it is convenient to introduce two invariants @xmath16 which are analogous to the bjorken variable .",
    "note that the variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the energy fractions of the detected hadrons in the @xmath2 center of mass system .",
    "they obey the following constraint due to the energy conservation : @xmath19 moreover , due to the momentum conservation there is a stronger constraint on @xmath17 and @xmath18 : @xmath20 within this region , these variables can vary independently . to perform the sudakov decomposition ,",
    "we choose two dimensionless light - cone basis vectors : @xmath21    in this paper , we choose the kinematics such that the photon and one of the hadron have purely longitudinal momenta while the other hadron has both longitudinal and perpendicular momenta : @xmath22 the leptonic momenta are @xmath23}{2\\sqrt{2}}n^*_{\\mu } + \\frac{q[1+\\cos\\theta_2]}{2\\sqrt{2 } } n_{\\mu } + l_{1\\ , \\mu}^{\\perp } , \\quad l_{1\\ , \\mu}^{\\perp}=\\left ( \\frac{q}{2}\\,\\sin\\theta_2,\\ , 0\\right ) ; \\nonumber\\\\ & & l_{2\\ , \\mu}=\\frac{q[1+\\cos\\theta_2]}{2\\sqrt{2}}n^*_{\\mu } + \\frac{q[1-\\cos\\theta_2]}{2\\sqrt{2 } } n_{\\mu } + l_{2\\ , \\mu}^{\\perp } , \\quad l_{2\\ , \\mu}^{\\perp}=\\left ( -\\frac{q}{2}\\,\\sin\\theta_2,\\ , 0\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the angle between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "below , we will omit terms of order @xmath28 . such a kinematics has advantage for analysis of the experimental situation , where the momentum of one of the produced hadrons is measured .    in order to ensure that the two hadrons are in different jets , we introduce two different variables @xcite : @xmath29 however , using eq .",

    "the mentioned transition is related to the azimuthal asymmetry distribution of hadrons .",
    "note that the symmetric case , with two similar fragmentation functions , has been well - studied from both the theoretical and experimental points of view @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric situation requires the simultaneous measurement of the meson azimuthal asymmetry in one jet and baryon ( say , @xmath139 ) polarization in another one , such measurements may be performed at belle .",
    "we use the co - ordinate ( or the impact parameter ) representation where the explicit definition of the transverse momentum is not necessary . in this case , the corresponding hadronic tensor takes the form : @xmath140.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the spin - dependent fragmentation function has been defined in the co - ordinate space as @xmath141 where @xmath142 denotes the hadron transverse polarion , and the collins function s analog in the coordinate space is given @xcite by @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the ( transverse ) position in co - ordinate space ; while @xmath145 , introduced due to the dimensional analysis , implies a parameter of the order of jet mass being the only dimensionful parameter in the soft part .",
    "the position in the coordinate space @xmath144 ( see , ( [ coll ] ) ) yields the derivative over @xmath41 in momentum space .",
    "therefore , inserting ( [ sp ] ) and ( [ coll ] ) in ( [ htxspace ] ) , we get : @xmath146 where @xmath147.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the kinematics defined above , we derive @xmath148 \\biggl[\\int\\frac{dz_2^\\prime}{z_2^{\\prime}}h_{1\\ , t}(z_2^\\prime ) \\delta(z_2^\\prime - z_2)\\biggr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , calculating the averaged hadronic tensor , one has the following : @xmath149^{\\prime } \\biggl[\\frac{h_{1\\ , t}(z_2)}{z_2}\\biggr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the analogous asymmetric combination corresponding to sidis process related to ours by crossing was also considered in @xcite . in that case , the incoming quark in sidis is described by the transversity distribution function : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the target polarization . using ( [ coll ] ) and ( [ tr ] ) , the corresponding hadronic",
    "tensor takes the form : @xmath152.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to study the @xmath137 ( or @xmath153 ) distributions in sidis and the related asymmetries , we should consider the weighted hadronic tensor which projects out the corresponding moment of the collins function : @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the unit transverse @xmath156vector @xmath157 which defines the transverse direction . using ( [ coll ] ) , ( [ tr ] ) and ( [ spidisn ] ) , one can see that the derivative @xmath158 in @xmath159 \\gamma^\\nu]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] should act only on @xmath160 , so that the result @xcite is equal to the standard expression for the contribution of collins function , except that the role of the direction of intrinsic transverse momentum is played by the auxiliary transverse vector @xmath155 : @xmath161 \\longrightarrow { \\rm tr } [ \\hat p_1 \\hat s \\gamma_5 \\gamma^\\mu \\hat",
    "p_3 \\hat k_t \\gamma^\\nu].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this substitution does not change the azimuthal dependence , as the weighted integration corresponds to azimuthal average : @xmath162 as a result the azimuthal dependence of the cross - section is transferred to the dependence on the angle @xmath163 , and @xmath164 corresponds to the _ moment _ of the collins function : @xmath165    thus , to describe the collins effect we suggest the @xmath137-dependent fragmentation function to be written in the co - ordinate space , where no specification of intrinsic @xmath137 is required . therefore",
    ", the calculation of radiation corrections and evolution may be performed in the same way as in this paper .    moreover",
    ", this approach may be applied @xcite for the description of higher weighted moments in @xmath137 and @xmath5 .",
    "say , choosing the term of order @xmath166 in the expansion of unpolarized fragmentation function in the coordinate space and taking the @xmath5 moment of the hadronic tensor weighted with @xmath167 corresponds to the account of the width of the @xmath137-dependent unpolarized fragmentation function .",
    "the exponential shape of the latter , in turn , corresponds to partial resummation @xcite of the infinite series of higher twists , analogous to that leading to the appearance of non - local vacuum condensates , when vacuum rather than hadronic averages are considered .",
    "the expansion in coordinate space accompanied by taking the respective weighted moments of cross - sections provides a complementary definition of observables , accounting for the shape of @xmath137-dependent fragmentation ( and distribution ) functions .",
    "we described a method which allows us to prove a factorization of the process with two fragmentation functions .",
    "we would like to point out that the presented method can be applied for any two - current process .",
    "the difficulties of factorization for such kind of processes emerge for the case when the kinematical transversalities inside the hadron are rather small .",
    "it leads to the problem in the definition of what is the hard subprocess for the process .",
    "following the idea of the paper @xcite , we showed that the corresponding @xmath49-functions in the hadronic tensors should be treated as the hard parts .",
    "it is based on the observation that these @xmath49-functions can be associated with the imaginary parts of the effective propagators related to the well - defined hard subprocess . as a result",
    ", we finally have the completely factorized expression for the hadronic tensor with the evolved fragmentation functions .    in this paper",
    ", the proposed method has been tested in the simplest case when the differential cross section of @xmath0 annihilation is related to the spin - independent integrated fragmentation functions .",
    "we also extended our approach to the study of the spin - dependent structures and @xmath137-dependent fragmentation functions ( collins function and transversity fragmentation function ) .",
    "this will allow us to perform the leading order qcd fits of relevant experimental data @xcite .",
