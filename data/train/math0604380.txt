    ", @xmath19 stands for the bulk modulus , @xmath22 the density and @xmath23 the unknown pressure . the velocity @xmath24 and acoustic impedance @xmath25",

    "wave propagation in heterogeneous media involves many different spatial scales .",
    "even with modern state - of - the - art supercomputers , a direct simulation of the highly heterogeneous media is often difficult if not impossible .",
    "that is why we want to use multiscale methods to solve on the coarse spatial scales .",
    "more precisely , we want to know how to transfer information from fine scales to coarse scales , and how to use the information obtained to solve the coarse scale problem with much fewer degrees of freedom .",
    "we often refer this procedure as numerical homogenization or numerical upscaling .",
    "the idea of using oscillating tests functions in relation to homogenization can be backtracked to the work of murat and tartar on homogenization and h - convergence , in particular we refer to @xcite and @xcite ( recall also that the framework of h - convergence is independent from ergodicity or scale separation assumptions ) .",
    "the implementation and practical application of oscillating test functions in finite element based numerical homogenization have been called multi - scale finite element methods ( msfem ) and have been studied by numerous authors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , numerical schemes have been developed to solve the acoustic wave equation with discontinuous coefficients , for example in @xcite by nonconforming finite element method and in @xcite by domain decomposition .",
    "recently , numerical homogenization or numerical upscaling methods such as @xcite are proposed for wave equation with heterogeneous coefficients .",
    "the finite element method in this paper is closer in spirit to the work of hou and wu @xcite and allaire and brizzi @xcite .",
    "it is based on a technique first introduced in @xcite for elliptic equations and extended in @xcite to parabolic equations characterised by a continuum of scales in space and time .",
    "the main difference lies in the fact that , instead of solving a local cell problem to get a basis function as in msfem ( multiscale finite element method ) or to calculate effective media property as in upscaling method @xcite , we use a global change of coordinates .",
    "the global change of coordinates allows to avoid the so called cell resonance problem and obtain a scheme converging in situations where the medium has no separation between scales .",
    "this makes our method amenable to problems with strongly non - local medias , such as high conductivity channels .",
    "we use a composition rule to construct the finite element space .",
    "i. babuka et al . introduced the so called `` change of variable '' technique @xcite in the general setting of partition of unity method ( pum ) with p - version of finite elements . through this change of variable",
    ", the original problem is mapped into a new one which can be better approximated . allaire and",
    "brizzi @xcite introduced the composition rule in the multi - scale finite element formulation , and have observed that a multi - scale finite element method with higher order lagrange polynomials has a higher accuracy .    the main difference with parabolic equations @xcite lies in the fact that with hyperbolic equations , energy is conserved and after homogenization there is no hope of recovering the energy ( or information ) lying in the highest frequencies .",
    "however when the medium is highly heterogeneous the eigenfunctions associated to the highest frequencies are localized , thus energy is mainly transported by the lowest frequencies .",
    "that is why , when one is only interested in the large scale transport of energy it is natural to approximate the solutions of by the solutions of an homogenized operator . for localization of waves in heterogeneous media ,",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present the formulation of the mathematical problem and numerical methods , and also show main results . in section 3 , we will give the detailed proof and explanation of the results in section 2 . in section 4 ,",
    "we present several numerical examples and conclusions .",
    "in general , the approximation power of finite element method is subject to the best approximation for an exact solution with respect to the finite element space . therefore , we require smoothness of the solution to prove convergence theorems .",
    "that is one of the reasons why standard methods are not applicable for problems with heterogeneous media .",
    "for example , in , we only have @xmath28 , and we can not gain anything if we approximate the solution with usual @xmath29 or @xmath30 finite element basis .",
    "however , as in @xcite , we can find harmonic coordinates which the solution of the wave equation is smoothly dependent on , which is the so - called compensation phenomena .",
    "we will focus on space dimension @xmath31 .",
    "the extension to higher dimension is straightforward conditioned on the stability of @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath32 be the harmonic coordinates satisfying @xmath33    let @xmath34 and @xmath35    [ cordes ] @xmath25 satisfies cordes type condition if : @xmath36 and @xmath37)^{-1}\\in l^\\infty(\\omega)$ ] .",
