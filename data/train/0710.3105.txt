    "radio galaxies are an important class of extragalactic objects : they represent one of the most energetic astrophysical phenomena ; they may be used as probes of their environments ; and they are unique probes of the early universe @xcite . as the 3cr sample of radio galaxies is radio flux - density selected @xcite , it provides an unbiased optical sample to study the host galaxies of these radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the sample has been well studied at multiple wavelengths and previous ground - based studies have investigated the spatial coincidence of optical emission nebulae and the radio source @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite first demonstrated the `` alignment effect '' at high redshift ( @xmath2 ) where the continuum optical and/or ir emission is aligned along the radio axis .",
    "an `` alignment effect '' for emission line gas was also shown by @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the alignment of the fine scale high surface brightness emission line gas imaged by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) with the radio emission . the primary mechanisms for the emission line gas alignment are thought to be shocks induced by the radio jet and photoionization from the central agn ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite demonstrated the redshift dependence of the alignment effect - at @xmath3 there is no alignment , at @xmath4 some alignment is seen , and for @xmath5 essentially all the powerful radio galaxies show strong alignment .",
    "@xcite found alignment at low @xmath6 if one compares the emission in the quadrants containing the radio source to quadrants without radio emission .",
    "studies which attempt to break the redshift - radio power degeneracy suggest that the alignment depends on both redshift and radio power ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , the alignment depends on both the presence of extended gas in the environment as well as the ability of the radio source to influence its environment .    in this paper",
    "we examine the relationship of the high surface brightness emission line gas and radio emission over a wide range of redshift ( @xmath7 ) , focusing on the transition redshift range @xmath1 where the alignment effect starts to turn on . using the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on hst",
    ", we obtained images with resolutions of 0.@xmath805  0.@xmath81 , similar to or better than the synthesis imaging resolution obtained with the very large array ( vla ) at 5 ghz in the `` a '' configuration .",
    "the higher resolution allows us to probe denser gas in the center of these galaxies .",
    "in addition , the tunable linear ramp filter ( lrf ) permits narrow band imaging of a selected spectral feature for a wide range of redshifts , enabling studies of a specified emission line for a sample such as the 3cr covering a large range of redshift .",
    "@xcite conducted an initial study using this data , and published a subset of the data . here",
    "we expand on their analysis , presenting the complete set of detected images as well as statistical results .",
    "the paper is organized in the following fashion : we discuss the properties of the sample in @xmath9[sec : sample ] .",
    "@xmath9[sec : observations ] discusses the observations made and the data reduction methods used . in @xmath9[sec : data analysis ] we outline the analysis of the data .",
    "@xmath9[sec : properties ] contains a discussion of our sources and the results of our study . in @xmath9[sec : conclusions ] we conclude by discussing the implications of our results .",
    "appendix [ appendix ] contains notes for individual sources .",
    "our sample is drawn from a set of 100 3cr radio galaxies selected from the hst 3cr imaging survey . using earlier spectroscopic observations , objects with significant emission line flux",
    "were selected @xcite for this study to maximize detection .",
    "thus , our results may not be extendible to objects with very faint emission lines and our observations do not reach uniform surface brightness in the rest - frame of the object .",
    "observations were done in hst s `` snapshot '' mode , in which targets are randomly selected from the target list for observation .",
    "80 sources were observed and constitute our sample , spanning a redshift of 0.017 @xmath10 1.406 ( see figure [ redshift_histogram ] ) .",
    "the sample contains 9 fris , 58 friis , 12 css sources , and 1 source of an unknown morphology .",
    "22 of the radio galaxies have broad emission lines while 58 have narrow emission lines in their optical spectrum .",
    "arcsecond - scale resolution radio maps for the sample objects were obtained from a variety of sources ( referenced in figure captions ) . sources",
    "for which 5 or 8-ghz vla ` a ' array maps were not already available were reduced using archival data .",
    "the cleaning and self - calibration of the raw data was performed using the nrao s aips software package .",
    "we present new maps for the following sources : 3c124 , 3c135 , 3c284 , 3c303.1 , 3c341 , 3c368 , 3c379.1 , and 3c382 .",
    "table [ table : vla_obs_params ] lists the observation parameters for the new vla maps , including the date of observation , frequency and rms noise of the final map .",
    "snapshot images were taken using the lrfs on hst s wfpc2 instrument .",
    "there are 3 wf chips and 1 pc chip .",
    "the chip on which the lrf images a target varies with the selected wavelength .",
    "we have noted the chip upon which a source was imaged in table [ table : optical_obs ] .",
    "nearby objects ( @xmath11 ) were imaged in h@xmath0+[nii ] .",
    "objects at intermediate redshifts were imaged in [ oiii ] 5007 @xmath12 and objects at high redshift ( @xmath13 ) were imaged in [ oii ] 3727 @xmath12 .",
    "table [ table : optical_obs ] also lists which emission line was imaged for each source . all of the lrf observations consisted of a pair of 300 sec exposures taken in `` snapshot '' mode .",
    "the images were calibrated and combined using the crrej procedure to remove cosmic rays @xcite . because the design of the lrf does not allow direct observations of the flat field , the images were flat fielded using the f656n flat .",
    "note that due to the small size of the wfpc2 pixels , we are sensitive only to high surface brightness extended emission line gas .    in order to obtain images of only the emission line region ( elr ) ,",
    "the continuum contribution to the lrf images was subtracted .",
    "this was usually done using an image of the object in the broadband f702w filter .",
    "the continuum was scaled to the observed wavelength by assuming a 3000k blackbody spectrum for the continuum @xcite . in some cases",
    "the continuum was contaminated by emission lines .",
    "@xcite discussed the uncertainties in flux calibration due to contamination from emission lines . using standard line ratios , they found corrections from 1.002 to 1.36 ( median 1.09 ) . we have not applied corrections for emission line contamination to our data , but the values given by them indicate the uncertainty due to contamination .",
    "continuum images were not available for four sources , 3c98 , 3c273 , 3c289 , and 3c323.1 , and the subtraction could not be performed .",
    "these sources have been left out of the analysis , but their narrow - band lrf images are presented if the source was detected .",
    "we grouped the emission - line nebulae into 4 broad optical morphological categories : ` extended ' sources ( 21 sources ) , ` partially extended ' sources ( 33 sources ) , slightly or unresolved sources ( 12 sources ) , and non - detections ( 11 sources ) .",
    "four sources were eliminated due to the lack of a continuum image for subtraction .",
    "sources were classified as extended if the 3-@xmath14 contour was extended compared with the expected psf in the continuum subtracted image . ` partially extended ' sources are those which feature extensions smaller than 2@xmath8 but do not match the psf .",
    "they often resemble an unresolved source , with a small faint extension .",
    "we analyzed only the ` extended ' and ` partially extended ' sources , as we were able to determine reliable position angles and/or angular sizes for most of these objects .",
    "table [ table : optical_data ] lists the morphological categories for each object .    to examine the spatial coincidence of the elr and the radio source , the radio and optical images for the ` extended ' sources",
    "were combined into overlays . in general , the images were registered using the radio core ( for the radio sources ) , and the centroid of the host galaxy ( obtained from the continuum images ) .",
    "one ` extended ' source ( 3c305 ) has a known dust lane , making centroiding on the continuum image unreliable .",
    "we attempted to determine a center through ellipse fitting to the outer portion of the galaxy , but this was unsuccessful due to the close companion galaxy .",
    "the registration in the image presented was done using centroiding on the continuum image .",
    "the overlays are shown in figures [ 3c46-montage ] - [ 3c381-overlay ] along with the continuum and emission - line images for each source .",
    "position angles ( pas ) for the ` extended ' sources were measured using the emission within the 3-@xmath14 contour , with the pa passing through the nucleus of the host galaxy in the direction of the longest extent of the emission line nebulae .",
    "pas for the partially extended sources were determined using iraf s ` ellipse ' task .",
    "radio pas were taken from the literature ( if available ) , or measured from hotspot - to - hotspot for friis or across the longest extent for fris on the radio maps .",
    "the measurement of the difference in the pas is independent of the spatial alignment of the radio and optical images as the position angles are independently determined from the images .",
    "a measure of alignment between the elr and the radio source was determined by taking the absolute value of the difference in position angles of the radio source and the elr .",
    "if @xmath15pa @xmath16 30 degrees , the elr and radio source were considered aligned . in some cases",
    "the elr displayed a position angle for the inner regions which differed from the large scale position angle .",
    "in most cases , the usage of an `` inner pa '' did not cause misaligned objects to be moved into the aligned category , so only the large - scale pa was used for the purposes of our analysis .",
    "emission line fluxes were measured using iraf s ` apphot ' set of tasks .",
    "luminosities and sizes were calculated using a cosmology of h@xmath17=71 km s@xmath18 , @xmath19@xmath20=0.27 , and @xmath19@xmath21=0.73 .",
    "values were obtained using an online cosmology calculator @xcite . in order to compare the luminosities from each source , the measured fluxes were converted to h@xmath0 fluxes using line ratios derived from observations of narrow - line radio galaxies @xcite",
    ". the ratios of [ oiii ] , [ oii ] , and h@xmath0+[nii ] to h@xmath0 were 3 , 1.23 , and 2.08 respectively .",
    "here we discuss the properties of the nebulae and their relationship to the radio source .",
    "individual source descriptions are provided in appendix [ appendix ] . in table",
    "[ table : radio_data ] we provide morphological information about the radio structure , including classifications , position angles , and angular sizes .",
    "we also present luminosities for each source .",
    "table [ table : optical_data ] contains the morphological information for the continuum - subtracted emission line images .",
    "this includes position angles , angular sizes , and fluxes .",
    "in addition , this table contains the v - band magnitudes for the host galaxies and the position angle of the galaxy .",
    "the detection statistics varied depending on the emission line observed .",
    "nine of ten sources ( 90% ) imaged in h@xmath0+[nii ] were detected .",
    "forty - three of forty - seven sources ( 91% ) imaged in [ oiii ] were detected , while fifteen of twenty - three ( 65% ) [ oii ] detections were made .",
    "the statistical significance of the observed relationships discussed in this section are given in table [ table : correlations ] .",
    "the kendall tau value is a measure of the correlation between the specified measurements .",
    "the spearman s rho value is a similar measure , describing how likely the two measurements are to increase or decrease concordantly .",
    "statistical values for non - correlations are given in table [ table : non - correlations ] .",
    "we find that 19 of 37 sources for which a pa could be measured showed alignment between the high surface brightness elr and the radio source to within 30 degrees ( figure [ delta_pa - redshift ] ) .",
    "we have 4 sources at @xmath5 which all show strong alignment . in the remaining 33 sources at @xmath1 , 15 show alignment .",
    "the median values of the position angle difference in bins of redshift do not decrease significantly as a function of @xmath6 out to 0.6 .",
    "however , the upper envelope of the position angle differences does seem to decrease with redshift .",
    "we clearly see a weaker alignment effect at low redshift than is seen at the high redshifts @xmath5 .",
    "our high resolution hst data show that the lack of strong alignment at @xmath1 is not due to a lack of spatial resolution .",
    "we investigated the possibility of the misaligned objects being predominantly broad line radio galaxies ( blrgs ) . according to the unified scheme @xcite , blrgs",
    "are not expected to show alignment as the jet would be pointing almost along the line of sight .",
    "however , blrgs make up only 11 of the sources with measured position angle differences , and several of the blrgs show alignment ( 3c234 , 3c268.3 , 3c277.1 ) .",
    "thus , orientation of the radio jet close to the line of sight is not responsible for the misalignment at @xmath1 .",
    "a potential concern is that much of the low redshift observations ( @xmath22 ) are obtained using the [ oiii ] line which is higher ionization than the [ oii ] and h@xmath0+[nii ] .",
    "if the high ionization gas has very different morphology and position angle than the lower excitation gas , this might reduce the strength of the alignment at low redshift .",
    "however , observations of radio galaxies in which both [ oii ] and [ oiii ] are obtained show that the estimated large scale position angles are consistent ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "another possible bias is the extent of the elrs for different emission lines .",
    "studies of single objects in multiple emission lines indicate typical ratios in the extended emission of @xmath231 - 6 for [ o iii]/[o ii ] and @xmath231 - 4 for [ o iii]/h@xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , as the transition between lines is made , the elr should be smaller for [ o ii ] than for [ o iii ] .",
    "as will be discussed in @xmath9 [ ssec : elr - size_l ] , the opposite is found .    over the redshift range of our sample ( 0.017 @xmath10 1.406 ) ,",
    "the expected ( 1+z)@xmath24 dimming of surface brightness is a factor of @xmath2330 - though the details will depend on the actual surface brightness profiles .",
    "thus , both the transition from [ oiii ] to [ oii ] and the ( 1+z)@xmath24 effect should result in apparently smaller elr at higher redshift . despite this , we see emission line size increasing with redshift ( see @xmath9 [ ssec : elr - size_l ] ) , suggesting that this result is real .    in order to investigate the possible effect of an instrumental sensitivity selection effect on the detection of alignment ,",
    "we redshifted the faintest level in the emission line images to see what would be detected if located at @xmath25 ( just prior to the onset of strong alignment ) .",
    "none of the misaligned sources showed any alignment when viewed using these modified levels .",
    "this indicates that the alignment effect is not due to a selection effect of the sensitivity of the instrument , but rather to some other inherent attribute of the source and its environment .",
    "the emission line images from hst were compared with previous studies using ground based imaging ( figure [ fig : hst - ground ] ) .",
    "morphologies and position angles were generally consistent between the two sets consistent with the hypothesis that the nebulae position angles do not exhibit large changes in position angle as a function of size scale .",
    "however , because of the lower surface brightness sensitivity of the hst / wfpc2 camera , the hst images show only the brighter inner regions of the nebulae .",
    "thus , the hst measured sizes and emission line fluxes tend to be smaller than those measured on ground based images .",
    "figure [ all_delta_pas ] shows a comparison of the distribution of position angle differences from ground - based data @xcite with our hst data . there is a suggestion that the hst data shows an alignment effect which is weaker than seen in the ground - based data at the same redshifts .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test indicates that the distribution of position angle differences in the hst data is consistent with a uniform distribution of angles , while the ground based data are not ( see table [ table : ks - results ] ) .",
    "if larger samples confirm this result , this may be due to the hst data mainly being sensitive to the higher surface brightness , more compact emission , suggesting that the alignment effect is mainly produced in fainter , more extended emission line gas .    .",

    "the linear sizes for fr ii and css sources were measured from hotspot to hotspot , and the linear sizes for fr i sources were measured across the overall extent .",
    "linear sizes for the emission line regions were measured roughly along the long axis ( if such an axis existed ) .",
    "comparing the relative sizes of the radio source and elr with the relative alignment indicates that sources with similar radio and elr sizes are more frequently aligned than sources in which the elr is much smaller than the radio source ( figure [ size_ratio - delta_pa ] ) .",
    "this is true at all redshifts ( figure [ size_ratio - delta_pa ] ) .",
    "we also note that all six of the small sources ( d @xmath27 15 kpc , i.e. , css ) are well aligned ( figure [ delta_pa - radio_size ] ) .",
    "all six of these have size ratios between @xmath230.3 and @xmath23 6 .",
    "these results suggest that the alignment at low redshift results when the source is smaller / younger and of a similar size as the nebula .",
    "this is consistent with suggestions that the alignment is due to mechanical energy input from the radio source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "are found at both high and low redshifts.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    in addition , 13 of the 29 large sources ( size greater than 50 kpc ) also show alignment to within 30@xmath28 .",
    "these sources are much bigger than their emission line nebulae ( factors of 10 - 100 ) . some of this alignment may be produced by chance if the position angles differences in at least some low @xmath6 sources are randomly distributed .",
    "however , some of the alignment may be real since we suspect the effect is starting to turn on at these redshifts .",
    "diagnostic line ratios and kinematics indicate that shocks are important when the radio source size is comparable to the aligned emission line nebula size and that photoionization dominates when the radio source is much larger than the nebula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "thus , in these large sources , the alignment may be produced by photoionization from the central agn along the  ionization cone \" .",
    "recombination times for warm gas ( t @xmath2310@xmath29 k ) are roughly 10@xmath30 years @xcite while the lifetimes of the radio sources are roughly 10@xmath31 ",
    "10@xmath32 years , indicating the ionizing mechanism must be on - going throughout the lifetime of the source .",

    "dense gas clouds are found on increasingly larger scales culminating in the large ly-@xmath0 halos surrounding powerful radio galaxies @xcite . of course",
    ", the radio luminosity will also increase with redshift in flux density limited samples , meaning the correlations may be related .",
    "studies which attempt to break the redshift - radio power degeneracy suggest that the alignment depends on both redshift and radio power ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . the more powerful radio sources can provide both more mechanical energy and more ionizing photons",
