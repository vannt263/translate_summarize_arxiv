    "3 .   otherwise , let @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "we know that @xmath299 , and in addition , since the first two cases do not hold and the diameter of @xmath0 is two , all the ( length two ) shortest paths from @xmath116 s vertices to @xmath68 go through the vertices in @xmath117 .",
    "this implies that every vertex @xmath300 has a neighbor @xmath301 ( @xmath302 need not be a one - one function ) . let us consider the set of at least @xmath303 edge - disjoint paths @xmath304 . for each @xmath305 , the probability that",

    "@xcite ) similarly to the proof of lemma [ lem : ab - rainbow ] : for every partial coloring of the edges we can efficiently bound the conditional probability that a fixed pair @xmath197 is not rainbow - connected , using the relevant one of the three cases concerning @xmath189 and @xmath68 that were analyzed above .",
    "now we can color the edges one by one , at each time taking care not to increase the bound on the conditional expectation of unconnected pairs that results from the above probability bound for every @xmath189 and @xmath68 . since the bound on the expectation was smaller than @xmath130 before the beginning of the process , in the end we would get a valid @xmath15-rainbow - coloring of @xmath0 .",
