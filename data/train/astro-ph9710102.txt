    "we use a hybrid method for applying waves to the initial conditions , with special attention to the correct inclusion of long waves  @xcite : an fft is used for short waves , but slow direct transforms are used with power law and log sampling for low @xmath23 , with switching defined by a @xmath23-space volume minimization criterion .",

    "simulations with the same initial conditions , but 100 , 50 and 25 comoving kpc initial spacing , show our standard 100 kpc computations are close to convergence in the @xmath20 images and in the column density distribution @xmath35 , but of course not in small scale dark matter clumping .",
    "however , tests halving the initial resolution to 200 kpc initial spacing show a significantly lowered mean opacity and fail to produce small dwarf galaxies ( removing objects below @xmath36 ) .",
