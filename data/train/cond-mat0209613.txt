    "since eigen and schuster introduced the concept of a quasispecies  @xcite , it has become a standard model to describe molecular and viral evolution .",
    "if a simple , single - peaked fitness landscape is assumed , quasispecies theory predicts that error - prone replication leads to the formation of a central `` master sequence '' , surrounded by a cloud of mutant sequences . for viral evolution , this implies that any `` wild - type '' sequence is accompanied by a cloud of related mutants that , as a whole , represent a target for the immune system .",
    "the quasispecies approach to molecular evolution has been the object of detailed investigations , often supported by techniques of statistical physics @xcite revealing the characteristic features of such systems , including the occurrence of an error catastrophe .",
    "the latter characterizes a system in which a critical mutation rate exists beyond which the genomic information is irretrievably lost to mutations , i.e. , beyond which selection ceases to operate  @xcite ( for an in - depth discussion of error catastrophes and related phenomena see also @xcite ) .",
    "the destabilizing effect of increased mutation rates has been observed for various viruses , including hiv  @xcite and poliovirus  @xcite .",
    "recently , various extensions of the eigen - schuster model have been considered , in particular involving the shape of the fitness peaks and the landscapes time - dependence . while the shape of the fitness function influences the robustness of a species to mutations  @xcite ,",
    "a behavior qualitatively different from the standard results can be observed for _ non - stationary _ fitness landscapes  @xcite . in rapidly changing environments ,",
    "a second catastrophe emerges besides the well - known error catastrophe , termed `` adaptation catastrophe '' . in a changing environment ,",
    "sequence replication must occur with a non - vanishing error rate to enable the species to keep up with the environmental changes .",
    "( in static landscapes , a zero mutation rate is ultimately optimal because it maximizes the average global fitness of the population . ) indeed , a selective advantage for so called `` mutator mutants '' ( or `` general mutators ''  @xcite ) has been observed for _ escherichia coli _ and _ salmonella enterica _ under challenging living conditions @xcite . for viruses in the environment of an adaptive immune system ,",
    "the fitness landscapes for both the virus and the immune system are dynamically generated by a co - evolutionary process .",
    "this dynamics can be studied within the quasispecies framework if the quasispecies character of _ both _ the viral population and the motifs of immune receptors is acknowledged . in an immune response , the presence of an antigenic epitope induces the proliferation of the corresponding immune receptor sequence .",
    "this `` master '' sequence is associated with a cloud of closely related receptor sequences that emerge from somatic hypermutation of b - cells in the germinal centers  @xcite .",
    "competition between a viral population and an adaptive immune system takes place via an asymmetric coupling : while the immune quasispecies is strongly attracted by the virus , the viral quasispecies is driven away from its current master sequence by the immune system .",
    "this predator - prey - dynamics results in a migration through sequence space as observed in many infectious diseases , such as hiv  @xcite .",
    "the co - evolutionary dynamics within an infected host was recently formalized within a model relying only on a few dynamical rules  @xcite , recapitulated in the following section . here , we focus on the implications of an optimal immune response within this framework , and consider the conditions that correspond to maximal _ viral _ fitness . finally , we compare known viral mutation rates to those expected if a viral population has achieved an optimal mutation rate .",
    "let us assume that the viral and the immunological quasispecies alike experience a single - peaked fitness function ( figure [ fig : dyn ] ) , albeit one that can change in time .",
    "let us assume further that at any particular time , the ( viral ) master sequence of length @xmath0 grows at a rate @xmath1 ( much larger than the `` off - peak '' or background - fitness @xmath2 ) , and similarly for the immune system : @xmath3 .",
    "such a simple immunological fitness function results from a reduction of the viral impact to induce proliferation of immune cells to its master sequence .",
    "analogously , only the dominant immune sequence imposes a decay rate @xmath4 on its complementary viral sequence .",
    "both species replicate imperfectly , with copy fidelities @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( denoting the probability for correct duplication of a monomer drawn from an alphabet of size @xmath7 ) .    co - evolution of viral and immune quasispecies.,width=264 ]    the virus  immune system interaction is implemented by the following dynamic rules that are cyclicly iterated , leading to the quasispecies migration through sequence space :    1 .",
    "once the immune system imposes a decay rate @xmath8 on the viral master sequence ( centered at the viral fitness peak ) , the narrow niche of the virus is assumed to move to an arbitrary sequence of the first error class .",
    "2 .   the viral quasispecies adapts to this new fitness peak on a time scale @xmath9 .",
    "the fitness peak of the immune quasispecies is adjusted , and moves to the new maximum of the viral distribution .",
    "the immune system adapts to the new fitness peak on the time scale @xmath10 .",
    "as discussed previously  @xcite , the dynamically generated time scale @xmath11 can be approximated by the two expressions @xmath12 and @xmath13    the relative growth of the ( moving ) viral and immunological master sequences in comparison to the environmental ( background ) sequences growth can be determined as  @xcite : @xmath14 leading to the conditions @xmath15 for viability of the viral and immunological species , respectively .",
    "the regimes of ( co-)existence of the two quasispecies can be determined by analyzing @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , the viral quasispecies is subject to both a classical error catastrophe at high mutation rates , and an adaptation catastrophe for small mutation rates . in contrast , the immune system ( as the driving force ) is not subject to a limiting migration velocity , and accordingly only displays the classical error catastrophe @xcite .",
    "having derived the relations quantifying viral as well as immunological viability , we can now deduce optimal strategies for both the virus and the immune system .",
    "the immune system attempts to minimize viral growth ( @xmath18 ) which implies the relation @xmath19 between the optimal immune receptor size @xmath20 and the per - site mutation probability @xmath21 .",
    "this prediction and how it fares against the background of experimental data has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "below , we extend this approach to derive the conditions for optimal viral escape from an immune response .",

    "the optimal per - site mutation probability @xmath36 then follows as @xmath37 figure [ fig : exact - vs - approx ] shows a comparison between the optimal mutation rate @xmath36 as given by the approximation  , and the exact solution @xmath36 obtained numerically from .",

    "the immune system adapts to a new virus strain within a time - span @xmath10 , while the virus replicates in a time - span @xmath47 .",
    "the ratio between these two time scales measures the duration of one generation of the virus in units of the response time of the immune system .",

    "( [ mug - opt ] ) , we expect to see this reflected in a relation between the mutation rate and genome size , such that their product is constant ( given a particular generation time @xmath47 ) .",
    "optimization of genomic mutation rate can take place via an optimization of sequence length , given any particular per - site mutation rate .",

    "data are reproduced from @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ shiv - tab ] shows that the optimal genomic mutation rate as predicted by formula is well within the range of the experimentally determined rate .",
    "this suggests that hiv-1 has adapted its mutation rate to optimally escape the immune system as well as the error catastrophe .",
    "the dynamics of co - evolution between virus and immune system can be studied within the framework of molecular evolution in time - dependent fitness landscapes , in which a constantly changing , polymorphic , viral population competes with an immune system adapting to keep track of the viral changes .",

    "the same formalism can be used to determine the optimal _ viral _ mutation rate , by maximizing the speed of adaptation while minimizing information loss due to mutations .",
    "it follows that the optimal viral mutation rate is reached if a sequence undergoes on average _ one _ mutation within the time it takes for the immune system to adapt to the viral genomic signature , thus barely staying ahead of the immune system .",
    "such optimal mutation rates are compatible with experimentally determined ones , and suggest that the constancy of genomic mutation rates within viral classes ( while sequence length and per - site mutation rates vary over many orders of magnitude ) can be explained by selection favoring viral strains at or near the optimal rate .    0.5 cm * acknowledgements * 0.25 cm this research was supported in part by the national science foundation under contract no .",
