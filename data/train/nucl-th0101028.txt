    "it has always been one of the basic challenges of theoretical nuclear physics to derive the basic properties of nuclei from realistic models of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions .",
    "very sophisticated approximation schemes have been developed to solve the many - body problem of strongly interacting nucleons .",
    "as examples we mention brueckner hole - line expansion@xcite , the coupled - cluster or `` exponential s '' approach@xcite , the self - consistent evaluation of greens functions@xcite , variational approaches using correlated basis functions@xcite and recent developments employing quantum monte - carlo techniques@xcite .",
    "( see e.g.  the recent review @xcite on these many - body approaches ) .",
    "a major ingredient for such investigations is the definition of a realistic nn interaction .",
    "here we define a realistic nn interaction to be a model for the nucleon nucleon interaction in which the parameters have been adjusted to obtain a very good fit of the experimental nn scattering data at energies up to the threshold for @xmath6 production . as examples for modern realistic interactions we refer to refs.@xcite .",
    "the central assumption of such investigations is that the nucleons can be considered as inert particles interacting by two - body forces , which are identical in the vacuum and in the nuclear medium .",
    "it is of course well known that nucleons are not elementary particles . at short distances",
    ", nucleons will polarize each other , which will lead to virtual excitations .",
    "these sub - nucleonic degrees of freedom are effectively taken into account in the realistic nn interaction as the parameters are adjusted to the data .",
    "as an example we mention the processes of the type that two nucleons interact with each other exchanging a @xmath6 or @xmath7 meson leading to a @xmath4 or @xmath5 state . after the exchange of a second meson",
    "the two baryons may be returned into a @xmath8 state such that this process contributes to the amplitude for elastic @xmath8 scattering . a theoretical approach which accounts for interacting nucleons only parameterizes this process with intermediate isobar excitations by adjusting e.g.  the coupling constant of the @xmath9 meson in a one - boson - exchange model for the @xmath8 interaction@xcite .",
    "if , however , the isobar configurations are included explicitely one finds that a large part of the medium range attraction in the @xmath8 interaction originates from the coupling to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 configurations .",
    "both kinds of models , with and without the explicit consideration of isobar configurations , yield essentially the interaction for two nucleons in the vacuum , since they are adjusted to reproduce the @xmath8 phase shifts .",
    "remarkable differences show up , however , if the different kinds of interactions are considered for the interaction of two nucleons inside a nuclear medium . while the exchange of the @xmath9 meson is essentially the same in the vacuum and in the nuclear medium , the formation of virtual @xmath4 and @xmath5 configurations is suppressed in nuclear matter ( due to pauli effects and binding of the nucleons ) as compared to the vacuum .",
    "this leads to a loss of attraction for the effective interaction of two nucleons in the medium , which results in a smaller calculated binding energy .",
    "this effect has been investigated by various groups using the brueckner - hartree - fock approximation , which means that correlations between nucleons are taken into account by means of the effective interaction , the @xmath10-matrix@xcite .",
    "the isobar degrees of freedom may of course also be considered explicitely in the solution of the nuclear many - body problem , i.e. one allows for many - body wave functions which contain isobar configurations .",
    "such investigations have been made e.g.  for the three - nucleon problem@xcite and for nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "presently , there is a renewed interest in the study of these isobar configurations in the nuclear wave function .",
    "one reason is the attempt to explore the isobar components in the nuclear wave function by means of different experiments .",
    "this includes the photoproduction of pions@xcite and the isobar current contribution to exclusive ( @xmath11 ) reactions .",
    "another reason is the development of new models for the baryon - baryon interaction including isobar configurations@xcite .    in this study",
    "we would like to investigate the predictions for the isobar components in the nuclear wave functions derived from various models for the baryon - baryon interaction . we are going to compare the isobar amplitudes calculated for the argonne @xmath2 potential@xcite with those derived from a recent update@xcite of model i in table b.1 of @xcite , which we will denote as bonn@xmath3 .",
    "both of these models are based on the meson exchange picture of the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "this means that e.g.  the transition potential @xmath12 is dominated by the contribution from @xmath6 exchange .",
    "while the bonn@xmath3 approach considers the complete relativistic structure of this term , the @xmath2 model reduces this @xmath6 exchange contribution to a local potential .",
    "this @xmath6 exchange contribution is supplemented by the @xmath7 exchange in the bonn@xmath3 model .",
    "the @xmath2 approach on the other hand adds a phenomenological contribution of short range .",
    "in @xcite it has been observed that the reduction of meson exchange interactions to the local approximation yields characteristic differences .",
    "can such differences also be observed for the isobar contributions ?    a quite different approach has recently been developed by the salamanca group@xcite .",
    "they derive a nn interaction in the framework of the chiral quark cluster ( cqc ) model .",
    "the problem of two interacting clusters ( baryons ) of quarks is solved by means of the resonating group method .",
    "the pauli principle between the interacting quarks is an important source for the short - range repulsion of the nn interaction@xcite . at large distances",
    "the @xmath6 exchange between the quarks in the two clusters evolves to the @xmath6 exchange between two baryons . at shorter distances , however , this non - local model for the baryon - baryon interaction might yield results that are quite different from a meson - exchange picture .",
    "this salamanca potential does not give such a perfect fit to the nn scattering phase shifts as the bonn@xmath3 or the @xmath2 .",
    "for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 partial waves of the nn system , however , the agreement with the empirical data is rather good .",
    "we are going to compare correlated two - baryon wave functions in the deuteron , @xmath1 and infinite nuclear matter derived from these three models of the baryon - baryon interaction . while the deuteron wave functions are obtained from an exact diagonalization in momentum space , the wave functions for @xmath1 and nuclear matter are calculated in the framework of the `` exponential s '' approach@xcite , generalized to include isobar degrees of freedom and evaluated in momentum representation .",
    "after this introduction we discuss some differences between the transition potentials for @xmath2 and bonn@xmath3 in the next section .",
    "the wave functions of the deuteron derived from these three models are compared in section 3 , while the correlation functions for @xmath1 and infinite nuclear matter are presented in section 4 .",
    "a summary and conclusions are added in the final section .",
    "the key for an understanding of isobar components in the many - body wave function of nuclear systems is the transition potential , i.e.  the matrix elements of the baryon - baryon interaction connecting two - nucleon states to @xmath4 and @xmath5 configurations .",
    "a transition @xmath15 implies the change of both spin and isospin from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "as isospin conservation has to be fulfilled at each vertex , such a transition requires the emission or absorption of an isovector meson , if one is considering a meson - exchange model for the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "the most important isovector meson contributing to such transitions is of course the pion .",
    "the @xmath18 has a considerable effect , too , but mainly for large momentum transfers between the interacting baryons .",
    "in this section we would like to compare the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) contribution as it is included in the bonn@xmath3 interaction with the corresponding term in the argonne @xmath2 interaction .",
    "as an example we consider the transition potential @xmath19 , in particular we will focus the attention to the central component as it shows up in @xmath20 partial waves .",
    "this ope transition amplitude has been formulated in a helicity representation in which the quantisation axis of the particle spins are the directions of the relative momenta @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the initial and final state ,",

    "it deviates from a simple pion - exchange propagator , as it has been derived from time - dependent perturbation theory accounting for the mass difference between @xmath27 and @xmath28@xcite .",
    "the function @xmath29 represents the form factor for each @xmath30 vertex .",
    "the initial relative momentum @xmath31 and the final relative momentum @xmath32 are chosen along the @xmath33 axis , @xmath34 , and in the @xmath35-@xmath33-plane , @xmath36 , respectively , where @xmath37 is the angle between @xmath21 and @xmath38 .",

    "@xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the circular polarisation vectors .    from both the dirac spinors for the nucleons and the rarita - schwinger spinors for the deltas , the complex momentum structure",
    "is now removed by taking their value at @xmath48 .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the helicity feynman graph structure ( [ feyn ] ) for all @xmath49 combinations of helicity projection numbers in this ` static ' approximation .",
    "most of them can be derived from symmetry relations  @xcite , and one only needs to evaluate 10 matrix elements explicitely .",
    "the helicity amplitudes are then projected onto states with definite total relative angular momentum @xmath50 : @xmath51 here , @xmath52 are the reduced rotation matrices with @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in the next step one performs the transformation into the basis of the partial wave states , in which orbital angular momentum @xmath55 and spin @xmath56 are coupled to @xmath50 : + @xmath57 the transformation coefficients have been taken from  @xcite .    in order to compare these matrix elements for the transition potential in the bonn@xmath3 model with the corresponding one for the @xmath2",
    ", we consider two approximations :    * in evaluating the helicity amplitudes of eq.([feyn ] ) the non - relativistic static limit is considered , i.e.  the dirac spinors as well as the rarita - schwinger are considered for @xmath48 . *",
    "the energy denominator in eq.([feyn ] ) is replaced by the usual pion propagator by ignoring the mass difference @xmath58 .    using these approximations an analytical expression is obtained for @xmath59 f_{\\pi}^2({\\mathbf{q'}}-{\\mathbf{q } } ) \\ ] ] that depends on the momentum transfer @xmath60 only .",
    "this means that the interaction is local . transforming this expression for the central part of the transition potential into configuration space",
    ", we can identify a yukawa term and a contact term , both multiplied by the form factor .",
    "this expression can be compared with the local transition potential as defined for the argonne @xmath2 interaction , @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 denoting the transition operator for spin and isospin .",
    "note that comparing this expression with the local approximation to the bonn@xmath3 model in ( [ resultloc ] ) , the contact term is removed and the form factor is replaced in @xmath2 by a gaussian cutoff to regularize the matrix elements for small interparticle distances .",
    "matrix elements of the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) contribution to the transition potential in the partial wave @xmath64 for these different approaches are displayed in fig .",
    "the relative momentum of the nn pair @xmath65 is fixed at @xmath66 and the matrix elements are presented as a function of the relative momentum for the @xmath5 state .",
    "the mass difference @xmath58 in the pion propagator of ( [ feyn ] ) has a remarkable effect on the calculated transition potential .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] from the comparison of the solid line ( bonn ) , which represents the complete ope contribution in the bonn@xmath3 potential , with the long dashed line ( @xmath6-range ) , which exhibits the results obtained after replacing the pion propagator of ( [ feyn ] ) by the conventional @xmath6 propagator .",
    "the inclusion of the mass difference @xmath58 leads to a quenching of the transition potential by about a factor two for small momenta , while the two curves approach each other at large values of @xmath67 .",
    "this means that the inclusion of the mass difference leads to a transition potential that is generally weaker and of shorter range , a feature which has already been observed e.g.  in @xcite .    if one furthermore employs the non - relativistic limit , one obtains the local representation of the ope of ( [ resultloc ] ) , which is given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by the dashed line ( local ) .",
    "the removal of the relativistic features yields a sizeable effect at larger momenta in particular .",
    "the dashed dotted line ( contact rem . ) results from the expression of ( [ resultloc ] ) if the contact term , the constant in the momentum representation , is ignored .",
    "the removal of this contact term has a very strong effect on the transition potential in this central partial wave with @xmath68 . only after removing this contact term",
    ", we obtain an ope component of the bonn potential , which is essentially identical to the ope contribution in the argonne v28 model .    the comparison of these various approximations in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] makes it rather obvious that the different treatment of the ope contribution to the @xmath69 transition potential leads to quite different matrix elements in the relativistic bonn model , defined in momentum space , as compared to the local treatment in the argonne v28 .",
    "this ope contribution is the most important ingredient to the transition potential in both models .",
    "the addition of the @xmath7 exchange in the case of the bonn@xmath3 model leads to minor although non - negligible modifications .",
    "this can be seen from the comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which shows matrix elements of the total transition potential .",
    "besides the results for the bonn@xmath3 and v28 models , this figure also shows the corresponding values for the quark model of the salamanca group @xcite .",
    "we see again the huge differences between the v28 and the bonn@xmath3 model , which even lead to a difference in sign . from our discussion above we know that the main part of differences can be traced back to the different treatment of the ope contribution .",
    "the salamanca chiral quark cluster ( cqc ) model , which we study as a third example@xcite can not be considered as an entirely realistic potential because it does not fit the @xmath70-phase shifts for nn scattering with good accuracy ; the phase shifts in the @xmath71 and @xmath72 channels are reproduced very well , however . in the cqc model ,",
    "the long - range interaction is generated by ope as well . in the core region ,",
    "the potential is determined by gluon exchange and the pauli principle .",
    "the latter requires total antisymmetry of the six - quark wave function and this leads to a dependence of the baryon - baryon potential on the initial kinetic energy @xmath73 of two interacting nucleons .",
    "for the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we assume a value @xmath74 for this energy .    the matrix elements for the transition potential of the salamanca model exhibit values in between the two approaches discussed above .",
    "the shape is similar to the one of the bonn potential , however , approaching the value of zero with increasing momenta much faster than the bonn potential .",
    "this might be an indication that the pauli effects in the quark model provide a much stronger cutoff at high momenta than the form factor used in the bonn potential .    as another example",
    "we compare results obtained for these three models also for the case @xmath75 in fig .",
    "the differences between bonn@xmath3 and v28 can again be traced back to the different treatment of the ope . for this partial wave , however",
    ", one does not obtain any contact term contribution .",
    "this implies that the v28 is stronger at small momenta as it ignores the mass difference @xmath58 in the pion propagator and weaker than bonn@xmath3 at high momenta because of the non - localities included in the bonn model .",
    "the matrix elements for the salamanca model are similar to those of the bonn@xmath3 potential at small momenta but exhibit features of a stronger cut - off at high momenta .",
    "solutions of the bound state two - particle problem have been obtained for the argonne v28 , the @xmath76 and the salamanca cqc potential .",
    "the nucleonic part of the deuteron wave function contains components @xmath72 partial waves .",
    "if @xmath0 degrees of freedom shall be taken into account explicitely , one has to extend the two coupled nucleonic channels by four @xmath5 partial waves , namely @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "no @xmath4 states can occur because the deuteron is an isospin @xmath81 state and the isospins of @xmath82 and @xmath0 can not couple to zero . the problem to determine the baryonic wave function in the 6 coupled channels has been solved in a spherical box with radius @xmath83 .",
    "the spherical bessel functions with the boundary condition @xmath84 can be used to construct a complete basis of orthonormalized states for the bound state wave functions within the spherical box@xcite .",
    "the coupled channel hamiltonian was calculated in this basis of momentum eigenstates of the box and diagonalised numerically .",
    "up to 300 discrete momenta were needed to get stable results for the binding energy .",
    "the results for energies and the wave functions obtained with the argonne v28 and the salamanca potential are in good agreement with the values given in  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "all @xmath8 interactions , which we consider , are adjusted to fit the total energy of the deuteron , which can be written as a sum of the kinetic energy @xmath85 and potential energy @xmath86 with @xmath87 note that the term @xmath88 sums up the kinetic energy from all partial wave components in the @xmath5 wave function and includes the contribution from the @xmath89 mass difference .",
    "the potential energy can be split into @xmath90    .[deuter1 ] contributions to the kinetic and potential energy of the deuteron originating from the different parts of the wave function .",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath85 is the sum of the kinetic energies originating from the @xmath8 wave function in @xmath20 ( @xmath91 ) and @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) partial waves plus the kinetic energy ( @xmath88 ) from the @xmath5 components .",
    "the term @xmath88 also accounts for the @xmath4 mass difference .",
    "the potential energy contains contributions from the various parts of the @xmath94 potential ( @xmath95 ) , the @xmath96 terms ( @xmath97 ) and the @xmath98 terms ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "results are given for the 3 models with isobar configurations .",
    "for comparison we also show results from pure nucleonic interaction models v14 and cdbonn .",
    "all entries are given in mev . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     although the sum of these various energy contributions yields the same energy of the deuteron for all the interaction models , there are remarkable differences in the individual terms .",
    "the inclusion of isobar components in the wave function yields a contribution to the binding energy of -5.21 mev , -6.75 mev and -1.59 mev for the v28 , the bonn@xmath3 and the salamanca interaction , respectively .",
    "this means that v28 and bonn@xmath3 predict an unbound deuteron , if the @xmath5 components in the wave function would be suppressed , while the salamanca interaction leads to a much weaker contribution of the isobar configurations .",
    "these differences also show up in the norm of the various partial wave components in the deuteron wave function listed in table [ deuter2 ] . comparing these occupation probabilities",
    "one finds that all interactions predict the largest contribution to the @xmath5 probability in the @xmath100 partial wave .",
    "the largest probability for this partial wave is obtained for the v28 potential , while bonn@xmath3 and the salamanca interaction in particular yield much smaller probabilities in this channel .",
    "the origin of these differences can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , which exhibits the @xmath5 wave functions .",
    "the argonne potential leads to a wave function in the @xmath100 , @xmath5 channel , which is of longer range than those derived from the other two interactions .",
    "the main reason for this feature is the fact that the ope contribution to the @xmath96 transition potential neglects the @xmath89 mass difference in the pion propagator ( see ( [ feyn ] ) ) , which leads to a transition potential of longer range . comparing the wave functions in this channel derived from the bonn@xmath3 and the salamanca interaction",
    ", one observes that the latter is strongly suppressed at short relative distances as compared to the former , which supports the argument presented already in the comparison of the matrix elements of the interaction , that the quark model leads to a much stronger effective cut - off at short distances than the cut - offs used in the meson exchange model .",
    "the most significant difference in the predictions for the isobar components of the wave function can be seen in the @xmath20 , @xmath5 channel .",
    "while the bonn and salamanca models yield occupation probabilities , which are of similar size as those for the @xmath100 , @xmath5 channel , the probability for this channel derived from the v28 potential is much weaker .",
    "a qualitative difference can also be observed from the inspection of the wave function in this channel ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the wave function obtained for the bonn and salamanca potential show a maximal amplitude for @xmath101 , while the corresponding wave function deduced from the v28 potential is suppressed at small relative distances .",
    "these differences in the wave function reflect the fact that the contact term in the ope contribution to the transition potential ( see ( [ resultloc ] ) and discussion there ) is removed in the local representation of the ope in v28 , while the non - local representation of the ope in the other models keeps a strong short range component .",
    "the comparison of the @xmath5 components in the deuteron wave function therefore reflects the main differences between the local approximation of the v28 and the non - local approaches of the bonn and salamanca model : the v28 contains a ope component of longer range and suppresses the short range components much stronger than the other two models .",
    "furthermore , the quark model approach leads to a stronger reduction than the typical cut - off that is used in the meson exchange models of the bonn group .",
    "this leads to much weaker @xmath5 components in the deuteron wave function for the salamanca model .",
    "it is worth noting that the contributions of @xmath102 to the potential energy of the deuteron ( see table [ deuter1 ] ) are significantly larger for the local argonne potentials v14 and v28 , than for the various versions of the bonn potential and the salamanca potential .",
    "this observation suggests that the local representation of the tensor components of the nn interaction , in particular the contribution originating from @xmath6-exchange yields matrix elements which are significantly larger than those evaluated within the non - local approaches ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the wave functions of many - body systems are studied in the framework of the coupled - cluster theory  @xcite . in the coupled - cluster approach one",
    "starts assuming an appropriate slater determinant @xmath103 and writes the exact eigenstate @xmath104 for the @xmath105-particle system as @xmath106 with @xmath56 an operator of the form @xmath107 where @xmath108 is an @xmath109-particle operator which can be written for the case of @xmath110 @xmath111 in this equation @xmath112 stand for fermion creation operators in states which are unoccupied in @xmath103 , while @xmath113 represent annihilation operators for the nucleon single - particle states which are occupied in the slater determinant @xmath103 .",

    "the @xmath114 amplitudes can be considered as correlation functions describing the difference between the correlated and uncorrelated wave function of two particles in the nuclear medium . as the uncorrelated slater determinant @xmath103 in ( [ eq : esansatz ] ) does not contain any isobar components , the @xmath114 amplitudes can be interpreted directly as the @xmath4 and @xmath5 component of the two - particle wave function , if @xmath125 in ( [ def : s2amp ] ) refer to @xmath4 and @xmath5 states .    as typical examples for these correlation functions in nuclear matter , the @xmath5 components for the relative wave function of two baryons in a state with isospin @xmath129 and angular momentum @xmath130 are given in fig .",
    "these components correspond to the components of the deuteron wave function in the same partial waves displayed in fig .",
    "in fact , these isobar components of the wave function for a pair of baryons in nuclear matter is very similar to the deuteron wave function if one compares the partial wave with @xmath131 .",

    "the salamanca cqc approach yields amplitudes for these @xmath132-waves which are considerably smaller .",
    "all these amplitudes are enhanced as compared to the deuteron wave function , which reflects the larger density of the nuclear matter system .",

    "the wave functions derived from the salamanca cqc interaction are rather different in nuclear matter as compared to the deuteron . at short distances",
    "they even have a different sign .",
    "this reflects a large non - locality or momentum dependence of the short range component for the @xmath96 transition potential derived in the cqc model .    in the nuclear many body systems one also observes bound states of two baryons in states with isospin @xmath133 . as an example of such configurations we discuss @xmath4 and @xmath5 components of two - particle wave functions in @xmath1 as displayed in fig .",
    "the comparison of the results obtained for the different interaction models leads to observations which are rather similar to those discussed for the states with @xmath134 above .",
    "the difference in the range of the transition potentials @xmath12 for v28 and the other two interactions is not as significant as in the case of the @xmath135 ( compare the discussion of the propagator in ( [ feyn ] ) ) , which leads to smaller differences in the tail of the @xmath136 @xmath4 wave function than in the corresponding @xmath5 state .",
    "a very significant model dependence is obtained in the @xmath13 , @xmath5 wave function .",
    "the isobar - isobar relative wave functions derived for nuclear matter and finite nuclei are rather similar .",
    "therefore we display only one of these examples for each channel .",
    "this demonstrates that isobar admixtures correspond to correlations in the many - body wave function which are of short range .",
    "therefore they are not very sensitive to surface effects in finite nuclei and a local density approximation should be appropriate to consider isobar effects in finite nuclei .",
    "three different models for the baryon - baryon interaction , which fit nn scattering data and explicitely account for isobar degrees of freedom have been considered .",
    "these are the local argonne v28 potential@xcite , the bonn@xmath3@xcite interaction model based on the relativistic meson exchange model and an interaction based on the chiral quark cluster ( cqc ) model which has recently been developed by the salamanca group  @xcite .",

    "significant differences are observed in the predictions from these models .",
    "these differences can be related to the assumptions made in determining the transition potential between @xmath8 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 states .",
    "the v28 interaction model yields isobar wave functions of longer range than the other two .",
    "this can be traced back to the approximations which are made in reducing the @xmath6 exchange contribution of the transition potentials to a local form .",
    "the most significant differences are observed in partial waves with @xmath68 at small distances",
    ". a main source of the discrepancies in these partial waves is related to a removal of a contact term in the local interaction model .",
    "the bonn@xmath3 and salamanca cqc model in particular exhibit important non - local features for the short range part of the interaction model .",
    "the salamanca model predicts rather small isobar components in the nuclear many - body wave function .",
    "these different predictions for the isobar components in the many - body wave function could be very useful in distinguishing between different interaction models .",
    "we thank d. entem for providing us with the salamanca cqc potential .",
    "also we would like to thank him but also francesca samarucca and ruprecht machleidt for useful discussions .",
    "one of the authors ( t.f . ) would also like to thank the dr .- carl - duisberg - stiftung for supporting this work by a grant that enabled a stay at the departament destructura i constituents de la matria in barcelona , spain .",
