    "since it is believed that majority of the stars in the galaxy are formed in star clusters , the star clusters and their surroundings are important tools to study the star formation process .",
    "it is believed that star formation itself is a destructive process : as massive stars form in the region , their strong stellar winds and ultra - violet ( uv ) radiation immediately begin to disrupt the natal environment , consequently halting further star formation in the region . alternatively strong uv radiation from massive stars associated with ionization front ( if ) can trigger next generation star formation either through ` collect and collapse process ' , which was proposed by elmegreen @xmath1 lada ( 1977 ) or through radiation driven implosion ( rdi ) of a molecular cloud condensations .",
    "detailed model calculations of the rdi process have been carried out by several authors ( e.g. , bertoldi 1989 , lefloch @xmath1 lazareff 1995 , lefloch et al .",

    "an observational signature of the ` collect and collapse process ' is the presence of a dense layer and massive condensations adjacent to an region ( e.g. , deharveng et al .",
    "2003 ) , whereas observational evidence for rdi process is often inferred from the spatial distribution of young stars and subgroups of ob associations and their age distribution ( see e.g. , matsuyanagi et al .",

    "a pre - existing dense clump is exposed to the ionizing radiation from massive stars of the previous generation .",
    "the head part of the clump collapses due to the high pressure of the ionized gas and the self - gravity , which consequently leads to the formation of next generation stars .",
    "thus one of the signatures of the rdi process is the anisotropic density distribution in a relatively small molecular cloud surrounded by a curved ionization / shock front .",
    "bright - rimmed clouds ( brcs ) are small molecular clouds located near the edges of evolved regions and show the above signatures .",
    "so they are considered to be good laboratories to study the physical processes involved in the rdi process .",
    "ngc 1893 is a very young cluster cluster ( age @xmath0 2 - 4 myr ) and a suitable object to study the star formation process .",

    "they found that the sources with masses @xmath51 have a disk fraction of @xmath52 , while lower mass objects ( @xmath53 ) have a disk fraction of @xmath54 which implies that disks around massive stars have a shorter dissipation timescale .",
    "the cumulative distributions of wttss and cttss in the mass range 0.2 @xmath47 m/@xmath48 1.0 reveal that these two distributions are different at a confidence level of @xmath55 suggesting that the wttss are younger in comparison to the cttss .",

    "p11 also has reported that the age and mass distribuions of class ii and class iii sources in the ngc 1893 are similar .",
    "since the morphology and age of tr 37/ ic 1396 is rather similar to that of ngc 1893 , it will be worthwhile to compare the age distribution of cttss and wttss of ngc 1893 with those in the tr 37/ ic 1396 globule region .",
    "the cttss and wttss in the tr 37/ ic 1396 globule region are identified on the basis of ew of h@xmath2 emission ( stars having h@xmath2 ew @xmath6 10  are considered cttss ) . the data for ew and ages have been taken from sicilia - aguilar et al .",
    "11 shows cumulative distributions of cttss and wttss of tr 37 region having masses in the range @xmath56 which indicates that although the distribution of wttss suggest higher ages for wttss , however the probability of these two samples belong to two different populations is only @xmath57 .",

    "the main results of the present work are enumerated as below :    1 .",
    "the ysos associated with the cluster region show an age spread of @xmath0 5 myr .",
    "the ages of the ysos located near the nebulae at the periphery of the cluster have relatively smaller ages as compared to those located in the cluster region .",
    "the result is in accordance with our earlier result ( s07 , maheswar et al .",
    "2007 ) which support a triggered star formation towards the direction of the nebulae .",
    "2 .   the density distribution of identified ysos indicates an aligned distribution from the ionization source to the direction of the nebulae located at the periphery of the cluster .",
    "since the cluster is not dynamically relaxed the alligned distribution of the ysos may be an imprint of star formation process .",
    "3 .   the fraction of disk bearing stars increases towards the periphery of the cluster .",
    "4 .   there is an evidence supporting the notion that the mechanisms for disk dispersal operate less efficiently for low - mass stars .",
    "the sample of class ii sources is found to be relatively older in comparison to that of class iii sources .",
    "this result is in contradiction with that recently found by chauhan et al .",
