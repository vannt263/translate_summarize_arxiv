    "recent astronomical observations @xcite have shown that the current universe experiences an accelerated expansion . to explain this unexpected phenomenon ,",
    "two remarkable approaches have been suggested . in the first approach , an exotic matter component with negative pressure",
    "is considered in the right hand side of the einstien equations dubbed as , dark energy in the literature .",
    "there are several candidates for the dark energy proposal such as the cosmological constant @xcite , canonical scalar field ( quintessence ) @xcite , phantom field @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite and so on ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the second approach is based on the modifying the left hand side of the field equations dubbed as , dark gravity .",
    "some examples of the modified gravity models are @xmath0 theories , string inspired gravity , braneworld gravity , etc ( for review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the interesting modified gravity model is the @xmath1 gravity which @xmath2 is the torsion scalar .",
    "this scenario is based on the `` teleparallel '' equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) @xcite which uses the weitzenbck connection that has no curvature but only torsion .",
    "note that the lagrangian density of the einstien gravity is constructed from the curvature defined via the levi - civita connection . in the context of the tegr ,",
    "the dynamical object is a vierbein field @xmath3 , @xmath4 , which form the orthogonal bases for the tangent space at each point of spacetime .",
    "the metric tensor is obtained from the dual vierbein as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the minkowski metric and @xmath7 is the component of the vector @xmath8 in a coordinate basis .",
    "note that the greek indices are refer to the coordinates on the manifold while latin indices label the tangent space .",
    "the lagrangian density of the teleparallel gravity is constructed from the torsion tensor which is defined as @xmath9 one can write down the torsion scalar @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the contorsion tensor defined as @xmath13 using the torsion scalar as the teleparallel lagrangian leads to the same gravitational equations of the general relativity .",
    "similar to the @xmath0 modified gravity , one can modify teleparallel gravity by considering an arbitrary function of the torsion scalar in the action of the theory , which leads to the @xmath1 theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that the field equations of the @xmath1 gravity are second order differential equations and so it is more manageable compared to the @xmath0 theories whose the field equations are @xmath14nd order equations .",
    "consequently , the modified tegr models have attracted a lot of interest in literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , a further modification of the teleparallel gravity has been proposed with constructing a torsional gravitational modifications using higher - derivative terms such as @xmath15 and @xmath16 terms in the lagrangian of the theory @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "the dynamical system of this model has been studied via performing the phase - space analysis of the cosmological scenario and consequently , an effective dark energy sector that comprises of the novel torsional contributions is obtained .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the energy conditions of this modified teleparallel gravity by taking into account the further degrees of freedom related to the higher derivative terms . indeed , one procedure for analyzing the viability of the modified gravity models is studying the energy conditions to constrain the free parameters of them . in this respect , one can impose the null , weak , dominant and strong energy conditions , which arise from the raychaudhuri equation for the expansion @xcite , to the modified gravity model . in the literature , this approach has been extensively studied to evaluate the possible ranges of the free parameter of the generalized gravity models . for instants , the energy bound have been explored to constrain @xmath0 theories of gravity @xcite and some extensions of @xmath0 gravity @xcite , modified gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite and scalar - tensor gravity @xcite .",
    "the energy condition have also been analysed in @xmath1 gravity @xcite and generalized models of @xmath1 gravity @xcite .    to study the energy conditions in this modified teleparallel gravity",
    ", we consider the flat frw universe model with perfect fluid matter and define an effective energy density and pressure originates from the higher - derivative torsion terms .",
    "then we discuss the energy conditions in term of the cosmographical parameters such as the hubble , deceleration , jerk , snap and lerk parameters .",
    "particularly , we consider two specific models that are proposed in literature and using the present - day values of the cosmographical parameters , we analyze the weak energy condition to determine the possible constraints on the free parameter of the presented models .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we review the modified @xmath1 gravity with higher - derivative torsion terms , the equations of motion and the resulted modified friedmann equations related to the model .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the energy conditions in this modified teleparallel gravity . in section 4",
    ", we explore the weak energy condition in two specific models of the scenario by using present - day values of the cosmographic quantities .",
    "finally , our conclusion will be appeared in section 4 .",
    "the action of the modified teleparallel gravity with higher - derivative torsion terms is defined as @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and for simplicity we have set @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 is the matter action includes the general matter field which can , in general , have an arbitrary coupling to the vierbein field .",
    "if the matter couples to the metric in the standard form , then varying the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the vierbein yields the generalized field equations as follows@xcite    @xmath23}}\\right\\ } \\\\&=\\frac{1}{2}e^{\\sigma}_{a}\\mathcal{t}^{(m)\\rho}_{\\sigma},\\label{field1 } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where for simplicity , we have used the notation @xmath24 and @xmath25 . note that @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote derivative with respect to the torsion scalar and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , respectively and @xmath30 is the matter energy momentum tensor which is defined as @xmath31 . in order to study the cosmological implication of the model , we consider a spacially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with metric @xmath32 .",
    "this metric arises from the following diagonal vierbein @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the scale factor .",
    "now we assume that the matter content of the universe is given by the perfect fluid with the energy density @xmath35 and pressure @xmath36 . thus using the field equations ( [ field1 ] )",
    ", we obtain the generalized friedmann equations as follows @xmath37    @xmath38 \\dot{f}_{x_1}+12h\\dot{h}\\dot{f}_{x_2}+24h^{2}\\dot{h}\\ddot{f}_{x_1}\\\\ & + \\left(\\dot{h}+3h^{2}\\right)\\ddot{f}_{x_2}+24h^{2}f_{x_1}\\dddot{h}+ h\\dddot{f}_{x_2}+24f_{x_1}\\dot{h}^{2}\\left(12h^{2}+\\dot{h}\\right)\\\\ & + 24hf_{x_1}\\left(4\\dot{h}+3h^{2}\\right)\\ddot{h}=-\\frac{p_{m}}{2},\\label{friedman2 } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where dot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time and @xmath39 is the hubble parameter . with the definition of the veirbien ( [ vierbien - frw ] ) , the torsion scalar and the functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively are given by @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44.\\label{x_2}\\ ] ] substituting ( [ tor - scalar ] ) , ( [ x_1 ] ) and ( [ x_2 ] ) in the equations ( [ friedman1 ] ) and ( [ friedman2 ] ) , we can rewrite the freidmann equations in the usual form as general relativity @xmath45 @xmath46 where the energy density and pressure of the effective dark energy sector are respectively defined as @xmath47    @xmath48.\\label{p } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since we have assumed a minimally coupled matter to the veirbien field , the standard matter is satisfied in continuity equation , i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "so from the friedmann equations ( [ friedman3 ] ) and ( [ friedman4 ] ) , one can easily verified that the dark energy density and pressure satisfy the conservation equation @xmath50 in the rest of this paper we analyze the viability of this modified teleparallel gravity scenario by studying the energy conditions to constrain the free parameters of the model .",
    "the energy conditions are originated from the raychaudhuri equation together with the requirement that gravity is attractive for a space - time manifold which is endowed by a metric @xmath51 . in the case of a congruence of timelike and null geodesics with tangent vector field @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively , the raychaudhuri equation is given by the temporal variation of expansion for the respective curve as follows @xcite @xmath54    @xmath55    here @xmath56 is the ricci tensor and @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are , respectively , the expansion scalar , shear tensor and rotation tensor associated with the congruence of timelike or null geodesics . note that the raychaudhuri equation is a purely geometric equation hence , it makes no reference to a specific theory of gravitation . since the shear is a purely spatial tensor ( @xmath60 ) , for any hypersurface of orthogonal congruence ( @xmath61 ) , the conditions for attractive gravity reduces to @xmath62 where the first condition is refer to the strong energy condition ( sec ) and the second condition is named null energy condition ( nec ) . from the field equations in general relativity and its modifications ,",
    "the ricci tensor is related to the energy - momentum tensor of the matter contents .",
    "thus inequalities ( [ energy - cond1 ] ) give rise to the respective physical conditions on the energy - momentum tensor as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor . for perfect",
    "fluid with energy density @xmath65 and pressure @xmath66 , the sec and nec are defined by @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively , while the dominant energy condition ( dec ) and weak energy condition ( wec ) are defined respectively , by @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "note that the violation of the nec leads to the violation of all other conditions .",
    "since the raychaudhuri equation is a purely geometric equation , the concept of energy conditions can be extended to the case of modified theories of gravity with the assumption that the total matter contents of the universe act like a perfect fluid .",
    "hence , the respective conditions can be defined by replacing the energy density and pressure with an effective energy density and effective pressure , respectively as follows @xmath71    using eqs .",

    "in order to analyze the torsional modified gravity model with higher - derivative terms from the point of view of energy conditions , we use the standard terminology in studying energy conditions for modified gravity theories . to this end , we investigate such energy bounds in terms of the cosmographic parameters @xcite , i.e. the hubble , deceleration , jerk , snap and lerk parameters , defined respectively as @xmath76 where the superscripts represent the derivative with respect to time . in terms of these parameters , the hubble parameter as well as its higher time derivatives are given by @xmath77\\\\&\\label{hubble - dot } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "the results of energy conditions in terms of cosmographic parameters for our modified @xmath1 gravity model can be achieved from the constraints ( [ nec])-([dec ] ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we adopt a specific function for the modified teleparallel lagrangian ( [ action ] ) as @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are constants .",
    "it has been shown that for a wide range of the model parameters the universe can result in a dark - energy dominated , accelerating universe and the model can describe the thermal history of the universe , i.e. the successive sequence of radiation , matter and dark energy epochs , which is a necessary requirement for any realistic scenario . since for a theoretical model to be cosmologically viable",
    ", it should satisfy at least the weak energy condition , we examine specially the weak energy condition in our analysis .",
    "more ever , for simplicity we consider vacuum , i.e. @xmath83 . inserting the cosmographical parameters ( [ hubble - dot ] ) in equ .",

    "( [ func1 ] ) for a suitable choice of the subspaces of the model parametric space .      in second case",
    ", we consider a class of models in which the action does not depend on @xmath98 but only on @xmath25 given by the following functional form @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are constants .",
    "it has been found that in this model the universe will be led to a dark energy dominated , accelerating phase for a wide region of the parameter space .",
    "the scale factor behaves asymptotically either as a power law or as an exponential law , while for large parameter regions the exact value of the dark - energy equation - of - state parameter can be in great agreement with observations @xcite . to examine the model via energy conditions , in a similar procedure to the previous subsection",
    ", we consider the vacuum .",
    "using the cosmographical parameters as before , the condition to justification of the wec are obtained as @xmath104    @xmath105    from eqs .",

    "so to analyse the energy conditions , we consider specific values for some of the parameters .",

    "shows the behavior of the @xmath94 and @xmath95 versus the free parameters @xmath101 and @xmath103 .",
    "as the figure shows , the specific model ii is consistent with the wec inequalities in the subspaces of the model parametric space .",
    "the modified teleparallel gravity with higher - derivative torsion terms is a generalization of @xmath1 gravity theories constructed from the higher - derivative , @xmath15 and @xmath16 terms , i.e. theories that are characterized by the lagrangian @xmath108 .",
    "it has been shown that this model can result in an effective dark energy sector that comprises of the novel torsional contributions due to the higher - order derivative terms .    in this paper , we have developed some constraints on this generalized @xmath1 model by examining the respective energy conditions . in this respect , we have written the wec , dec , nec and sec in terms of an effective energy - momentum tensor which arises from the further degrees of freedom related to the higher - derivative terms . in order to illustrate how these conditions can constrain the model ,",
    "we have considered two specific functional forms of the lagrangian that account for accelerating phase of the universe for a wide range of their parameter spaces .",
    "specially , we have examined the validity of wec to obtain bounds on the free parameters of both models . rephrasing the wec inequalities in terms of the present - day values of the cosmographic parameters",
