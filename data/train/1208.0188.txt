    "finding the ground - state of a quantum system can be recast as an optimization problem by minimizing the hamiltonian expectation over the space of trial wave functions . in practice , it is important for the efficiency of the variational method , to have a succinct representation of the trial wave functions that accurately describe the ground - state of the quantum system @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , finding the optimal variational parameters could be a hard computational task even in one dimension @xcite since the objective function is an average quantity computed over the exponentially large hilbert space of the physical system , let alone the complex landscape of the energy function induced by different sources of frustrations .",
    "and the problem is more serious for fermions due to the global nature of the fermion sign @xcite .",
    "still , the main strategy to deal with the above variational problem , is to use monte carlo ( mc ) method both in computing the hamiltonian expectation and in optimizing over the variational parameters @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we further develop the variational quantum cavity method introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the ground - state properties of an interacting fermion system . more precisely , for a given instance of the variational parameters , we connect the quantum expectations to average quantities in a classical system of interacting particles or spins , where the interactions are related to the variational parameters .",
    "then , instead of mc sampling , we use the bethe approximation @xcite , or cavity method in the replica - symmetric approximation @xcite to estimate the classical expectations . within the bethe approximation ,",
    "the probability marginals are obtained by an efficient and local message - passing ( mp ) algorithm @xcite ; the estimated marginals are good as long as the interaction graph is locally tree - like , the classical system is in a replica - symmetric phase and it is effectively mean - field @xcite .",
    "some applications of the cavity method in quantum systems can be found in refs .",
    "one may find some connections among these papers , the ( statistical ) dynamical mean - field theory @xcite , and density - matrix renormalization group @xcite .",
    "the trial wave functions can be characterized by the type of interactions included in the associated classical system .",
    "we usually start from the mean - field ( mf ) approximation considering only the one - body interactions , and improve on that by adding higher - order interactions to capture the relevant correlations . for bosons , a good estimation of the quantum expectations",
    "can be obtained by considering local interactions involving only a few number of particles @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the hamiltonian expectation is a local function of the variational parameters and we can again utilize the bethe approximation to estimate the optimal parameters by a higher level mp algorithm @xcite . in the case of fermions , however , we have to work with global interactions involving an extensive number of particles to deal with the global nature of the fermion sign . consequently , the average energy becomes a nonlocal function of the variational parameters and we can not exploit the local mp algorithms to optimize over the parameters anymore .    in this paper",
    "we take the hubbard model and propose a class of trial wave functions with both local and global interactions , where the hamiltonian expectation can be computed by an mp algorithm .",
    "using some heuristic minimization algorithms we find approximate ground - states of the hubbard model in random regular graphs of degree @xmath0 .",
    "the results are considerably better than the mf predictions , and are close to the exact solutions in small systems . for comparison we also present some results in one- and two - dimensional lattices .",
    "in the next section we give some definitions and use the mean - field approximation to illustrate the main points that are relevant for the following discussions . in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] we introduce the global ansatz of the wave functions and the machinery we need to deal with the global interactions within the bethe approximation . the numerical data are presented in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] and finally we summarize the results in sec .",
    "consider the hubbard model with hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 with index @xmath3 that labels the sites in the quantum interaction graph @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 are creation and annihilation operators for a fermion of spin @xmath7 at site @xmath8 .",
    "we will work in the occupation number representation @xmath9 and will take the following order of the sites and spins : @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that there is a path in @xmath4 connecting @xmath11 representing the ordering backbone . given a trial wave function @xmath12 depending on a set of variational parameters @xmath13 , we write the hamiltonian expectation as @xmath14 $ ] with @xmath15 depending on the trial wave function we obtain different expressions for @xmath16 but we always have @xmath17 .",
    "the goal is to consider @xmath18 as a probability measure in a classical system and to compute the above average quantities within the bethe approximation .",
    "the classical measure is , in general , represented by @xmath19 with the set of classical interactions @xmath20 . here , @xmath21 is the subset of variables that appear in interaction @xmath22 .    in a mf approximation , we take a factorized trial wave function including the gutzwiller interactions @xcite , @xmath23 with complex parameters @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "this results in the following classical measure @xmath26 . by superscript @xmath27 ,",
    "we mean the real part of the parameters .",
    "given the above measure , we find @xmath28 where we defined @xmath29 with @xmath30 and vice versa . here",
    "we can easily compute the average local energies , e.g. , @xmath31,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath32 and @xmath33 there are a few points to mention here : first , the only difference with a bosonic system is the sign term @xmath34 .",
    "it is clear that , in the absence of this sign and for @xmath35 , we can minimize the average energies by setting the imaginary part of the parameters to zero .",
    "when the sign term is present or the @xmath36 take different signs , one can show that , starting from real parameters , one always remains in the real subspace of the parameters following a gradient descent algorithm .",
    "this is true not only for the mf wave function , but also for the class of wave functions that we consider in this paper .",
    "second , in the mf approximation , the average of the sign term is exponentially small in the number of sites @xmath37 between @xmath8 and @xmath38 .",
    "this suggests that smaller average energies are obtained by maximizing the overlap between the ordering chosen in the trial wave function and the quantum interaction graph @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the density profile would also depend on the ordering unless the parameters are constrained to respect the system s translational symmetries .",
    "this artifact of the mf approximation has to be cured by adding interactions to the classical interaction graph @xmath39 to correlate distant variables along the ordering backbone . and",
    "finally , due to the sign term the average energy is not a local function of the parameters .",
    "this sets some restrictions on the optimization algorithms that we can use in minimizing the hamiltonian expectation .",
    "the simplest interactions to improve the mf approximation are local two - body or jastrow interactions @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to guess that these interactions are not enough to capture the sign correlations .",
    "the interaction set could , of course , be enlarged by adding other many - body interactions also including different types of spins . instead , here",
    ", we take another approach by introducing global variables @xmath41 .",
    "then the sign term @xmath34 can be written as @xmath42 , which is a local function of the global variables @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we can have global one - body interactions @xmath43 and global two - body interactions @xmath44 in the classical interaction graph .",
    "we call this set of trial wave functions the global ansatz",
    ". in general one could have interactions of type @xmath45 .",
    "notice that the above interactions do not necessarily respect the symmetries of the system .",
    "however , by minimizing the hamiltonian expectation over the variational parameters , we get closer to the ground state of the system and , therefore , minimizing the effect of these asymmetries .    in the following ,",
    "we consider the global one- and two - body interactions , i.e. : @xmath46 where , for simplicity , we are going to assume @xmath47 . as a result , we obtain @xmath48 with @xmath49 as given before and @xmath50 the average energy is computed with respect to the following classical measure : @xmath51 where , for brevity , we defined @xmath52 , and @xmath53 the indicator functions @xmath54 check the constraints @xmath55 on the global variables if @xmath56 , and @xmath57 fixes the boundary condition @xmath58 when @xmath59 . to estimate the average energy , we resort to the bethe approximation , writing the local marginals in terms of the cavity ones satisfying the following set of equations @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the neighborhood set of site @xmath8 in @xmath39",
    "these are the belief propagation ( bp ) equations @xcite that are solved by iteration starting from random initial cavity marginals . in the replica - symmetric approximation",
    "we assume there is a fixed point to the bp equations describing the single gibbs state of the system .",
    "the average @xmath62 is simply computed after the local marginal @xmath63 , which is computed like @xmath64 but taking all the neighbors into account . in the other part of the average energy ,",
    "we need to compute expectations , such as @xmath65 . to get around the problem of computing the average of a global quantity we rewrite it as @xmath66 , introducing the complex measure @xmath67 and the corresponding free energy @xmath68 .",
    "the free energy difference in the bethe approximation is given by @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the free - energy changes by adding site @xmath8 and the interaction between sites @xmath8 and @xmath38 , respectively , that is , @xmath72 and similarly for the complex measure @xcite .",
    "in this way , we can compute the hamiltonian expectation for the above class of trial wave functions with a local message - passing algorithm in a time complexity of order @xmath73 for sparse classical and quantum interaction graphs . note that a small error in estimating the classical free energies could result in a large error in estimating the average energy due to the exponential factor @xmath74 .",
    "having the hamiltonian expectation for an arbitrary instance of the variational parameters , we need an optimization algorithm to find the optimal parameters .",
    "this is a computationally hard problem , and we have to resort to some heuristic algorithms to find an approximate ground state for the system .",
    "let us start from a local minimization algorithm where , in each step , we fix all the parameters except in a small region of the system and minimize the associated energy contribution . for instance , in case @xmath75 , we take the subset @xmath76 and minimize the following energy : @xmath77 the energy function is chosen as the sum of the average energies that explicitly depend on the subset of the parameters . the index @xmath8 is selected randomly , and the corresponding parameters are updated .",
    "the process ends when no local update can decrease the average energy .    in another algorithm ,",
    "we use a population of the parameters @xmath78 and update the population in order to find smaller average energies . more precisely , in each step",
    ", we select two sets of parameters @xmath79 and find the set @xmath80 minimizing the average energy along the line @xmath81 for @xmath82 $ ] . then , we replace the maximal member of the population with @xmath80 and change the position of points @xmath22 and @xmath83 to somewhere between @xmath80 and the minimal member of the population @xmath84 .",
    "that is , @xmath85 and @xmath86 for some random vectors @xmath87 .    and",
    "finally , in a gradient descent algorithm , the parameters are updated as @xmath88 for some small and positive @xmath89 s .",
    "this means that we need to have the cavity susceptibilities @xmath90 , which can be obtained by taking the derivative of the bp equations .",
    "for instance , we have @xmath91 if @xmath92 , otherwise , @xmath93 . here",
    "we defined @xmath94 and @xmath95 is obtained by normalization @xmath96 .",
    "these are called the susceptibility propagation equations @xcite .",
    "similarly , we can write the equations for the cavity susceptibilities for the complex measure defined in the previous section .    we can use a combination of the above algorithms to approach the optimal parameters , for example , the local minimization algorithm followed by the gradient descent algorithm . in the following",
    ", we always start from zero initial parameters or a population of parameters distributed randomly around zero in the case of population dynamics .",
    "the algorithms are repeated a number of times to get the best outcome for different realizations of the update process .     and in one dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "the data are obtained by the local minimization algorithm followed by the gradient descent algorithm and repeated for @xmath97 different realizations of the update process .",

    ", a gap opens up at the half - filling density , and we observe another phase transition from the metallic phase to an insulator phase with zero kinetic energy . notice that , due to the exponential decay of the sign term in this approximation , the model on the random regular graph behaves nearly as the one - dimensional system .",
