    "over the last two decades , numerous experiments have been performed on bilayer quantum hall systems ( bqhss ) at total filling factor @xmath1 , revealing a very rich physical system . in a series of groundbreaking experiments in the early years of the current decade",
    ", evidence was found for the existence of an excitonic superfluid,@xcite as well as of the associated goldstone mode.@xcite this phase is destroyed by increasing the effective interlayer separation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the distance between the layers and @xmath4 the magnetic length . for small effective separations , the system is in an incompressible phase and the hall conductivity exhibits a plateau at @xmath5 , whereas at large effective separations , the layers decouple and the fermi - liquid behaviour of two independent layers is recovered ; here , the system is in a compressible phase . the critical effective interlayer separation @xmath6 has been shown to be sensitive to charge imbalance , tunnelling amplitudes and in - plane magnetic fields.@xcite in addition to the compressible - incompressible transition discussed above , a commensurate - incommensurate transition has been identified , driven by an in - plane magnetic field.@xcite recently , detailed measurements on this aspect of the system  @xcite have become available .",
    "this wealth of experimental findings has naturally renewed the theoretical interest in the system . at present , three independent models of the neutral ( spin - flip ) excitations of a bilayer system at @xmath7 and the case of equal electron populations in each layer exist in the literature,@xcite with three different derivations and two different predicted spectra .",
    "this state of affairs merits an investigation .",
    "that is the first aim of this paper : to compare and contrast , and where possible to link , the existing models .",
    "random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations have revealed a linear goldstone mode,@xcite in qualitative and even rough quantitative agreement with experiment.@xcite subsequently , an approximation based on pseudospin waves has been proposed for the system in the presence of strong tunnelling,@xcite which reproduces the rpa result from ref .   in the non - tunnelling limit .",
    "lastly , in recent years , a bosonisation method has been proposed@xcite to directly study the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of excitons detected experimentally",
    ".  @xcite the same @xmath8 system with _",
    "unequal _ layer electron populations has also been studied using similar techniques in ref .  .",
    "we will develop a unifying framework that links all three models for the balanced case and allows for further approximations .",
    "this first aim is subsidiary to a second purpose : to create a model for a bilayer system at @xmath7 with an in - plane magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "apart from the above - mentioned experimental findings , in - plane magnetic fields are often used to suppress tunnelling between the layers , in order to study the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) in bilayer systems without interlayer tunnelling.@xcite    early theoretical work in this area has led to the prediction of a commensurate - incommensurate phase transition.@xcite we will revisit the problem , and derive an equation for the ground state energy from the underlying microscopic physics . this equation was proposed in ref .  , but is explicitly derived here . following the work by hanna _ _ et al.__@xcite we calculate at which in - plane magnetic field strength the commensurate - incommensurate transition should occur , with the aim of comparing the theoretical prediction to recent experimental observations.@xcite although this model is based on small in - plane fields , it turns out to agree with experiments in the regime of low electron densities . including finite - temperature effects by means of a renormalisation group analysis ( details of which are presented elsewhere@xcite ) yields a small change in critical in - plane field , which is not enough to explain the difference between the theoretical predictions and the experimental observations at larger electron densities .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the bqhs and derive its microscopic hamiltonian . in section iii , we discuss the various models that exist in the literature , introduce one new bosonisation approach , and analyse the differences between the models .",
    "this analysis results in a unifying framework where all the models that are investigated here can be seen to be variations of each other . in section iv , we introduce an in - plane field into the bilayer system , and microscopically derive an equation for the ground state energy of the bilayer system with in - plane field .",
    "we then present some results coming out of that model , including a finite - temperature result obtained by means of a renormalisation group analysis .",
    "section v contains conclusions and a discussion .",
    "a bqhs consists of two individual two - dimensional electron gas layers , parallel and at a distance @xmath3 to each other .",
    "the qhe occurs in such systems at low temperatures and under strong perpendicular magnetic fields . in these circumstances ,",
    "the system is characterised by four parameters : the total _ filling factor _",
    "@xmath10 , the interlayer separation @xmath3 , the tunnelling amplitude @xmath11 , and the charge imbalance @xmath12 .",
    "the total filling factor is given by the sum of the filling factors of the upper ( @xmath13 ) and lower ( @xmath14 ) layers , @xmath15 , whereas the charge imbalance @xmath16 is the difference between the individual layer filling factors .",
    "the filling factor of an individual layer @xmath17 counts the number of filled landau levels within that layer .",
    "we will concentrate on a system with @xmath7 and zero charge imbalance , such that each layer has filling factor 1/2 .",
    "this restricts the dynamics to the lowest landau level ( lll ) , which means that we must project all operators into the lll .",
    "the other two important parameters are the effective interlayer separation @xmath2 , where @xmath18 is the magnetic length , and the ratio between the tunnelling amplitude @xmath11 and the characteristic coulomb interaction energy @xmath19 .",
    "these two dimensionless parameters can be tuned experimentally through the magnetic field strength @xmath20 . by varying @xmath2 , the relative importance of the interlayer coulomb interaction",
    "is changed , since @xmath4 is proportional to the average distance between two neighbouring electrons within one layer .",
    "increasing @xmath21 enhances the interlayer coherence , since the tunnelling energy favours a coherent state .",
    "we will take the temperature and zeeman splitting to be such that the electron spins are completely frozen . from a single - particle viewpoint , the layer degree of freedom",
    "gives rise to a two - state system , so the relevant hilbert space is the same as that of a spin-1/2 system . using this similarity",
    ", we map the system to a single - layer system where the layer degree of freedom is described by a pseudospin variable . in the absence of tunnelling or a bias voltage ,",
    "there is no energy associated with the pseudospin of an electron .",
    "the coulomb interaction , however , _ is _ pseudospin - dependent , since the interlayer repulsion is weaker than the intralayer repulsion .",
    "orienting the axes of the spin system such that @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) indicates an electron in a(n ) ( anti)symmetric superposition of being in both layers , the coulomb part of the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the spin - dependent coulomb interaction . the density operator @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 where the operator @xmath28 destroys ( creates ) an electron with spin @xmath29 in the guiding centre @xmath30 . the function @xmath31 is defined in appendix [ lllprojectionalg ] .",
    "similarly , we can define spin density operators for later use :    [ spindensityops ] @xmath32    the density operators defined in eqs .   and obey the lll projection algebra , which is discussed in appendix [ lllprojectionalg ] .",
    "the coulomb hamiltonian can be split up into total density and spin parts by writing @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( note that we are working in a unit area system : @xmath35 ) .",
    "the @xmath36-term measures the capacitive energy due to charge imbalance between the layers , since @xmath37 is proportional to the charge imbalance .",
    "interlayer tunnelling adds a term @xmath38 : @xmath39 where the relation between @xmath40 and @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 .",
    "since the kinetic term is constant and therefore irrelevant in the @xmath7 case , we now have the total hamiltonian @xmath43 the @xmath44-term is invariant under rotations of the spin , whereas the @xmath36-term favours @xmath45 due to the positivity of @xmath36 . in other words",
    ", it disfavours spin orientations that do not lie in the plane parallel to the layers . in the absence of the tunnelling term",
    ", the spin orientation is constrained to lie in the plane but is otherwise free .",
    "note that the orientation of the spin axes can be chosen freely : for example , one can choose to use spin up ( down ) to represent an electron in the upper ( lower ) layer .",
    "in that case , the roles of @xmath37 and @xmath46 in eq .",
    "are inverted and it is the spin @xmath47-axis that is perpendicular to the layers .",
    "to accomodate the presence of a strong tunnelling term , we will work in the symmetric / antisymmetric ( s / as ) basis . starting from a symmetric ground state , we study the antisymmetric excitations , which are approximately bosonic in nature . defining the bosonic vacuum to be the ferromagnet",
    ", we describe the excitations above the ferromagnet as a system of noninteracting bosons .      in the presence of tunnelling",
    ", the symmetric state has the lowest energy , since the single - electron wavefunction for that state has no nodes in the direction perpendicular to the layers , whereas the one for the antisymmetric state has a single node .",
    "the level splitting between the symmetric and antisymmetric states is proportional to the tunnelling amplitude and allows us to represent the ground state as a ferromagnet , in which all spins point in the same direction .",
    "this implies that a particular direction in spin space is selected .",
    "it is the tunnelling term that determines the preferred direction and thus breaks the in - plane symmetry . in our chosen spin orientation ,",
    "its momentum space form is @xmath48 , which favours a uniform state in which the spin is oriented in the spin @xmath47 direction everywhere , parallel to the plane of the layers .",
    "we have chosen the spin orientation such that the resulting hamiltonian is diagonal when @xmath49 , which occurs when the interlayer distance vanishes . in that case , the ground state , which we denote by @xmath50 , is the state in which all spins are oriented along the spin @xmath47-axis : @xmath51 . if , on the other hand , @xmath52 , the hamiltonian is no longer diagonal , because @xmath50 is not an eigenstate of @xmath37 .",
    "the excitations above this ferromagnet are magnons , created by the operator @xmath53 . with the help of the lll projection algebra ( appendix [ lllprojectionalg ] ) ,",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath54 { | { \\chi}\\rangle } \\propto { \\delta}_{{\\mathbf{p } } , { \\mathbf{q}}}$ ] .",
    "this implies that near the ground state , modes created by @xmath55 are approximately bosonic . following earlier",
    "work,@xcite we can define a magnon operator @xmath56 by normalising @xmath55 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the total number of electrons in the system . by explicit calculation , the single - magnon modes @xmath59 can be seen to be exact orthonormal eigenstates of the @xmath49 hamiltonian .",
    "hence , our choice of spin orientation is appropriate to study excitations above the small-@xmath36 limit of the system .",
    "macdonald _ et al .",
    "_ have proposed a model based on the magnon - like excitations mentioned above.@xcite here , we briefly repeat the main results of that study with the aim of comparing them to the outcomes of other studies , as well as our own findings . the calculation of the excitation spectrum is based on a tried and tested method:@xcite assuming the magnon density is low enough for the interaction to be negligible , one takes @xmath60 ignoring the magnon - magnon interaction comes down to computing the excitation spectrum as if there is only one mode ; hence , it is called the _ single - mode approximation_. taking into account the off - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian in the magnon basis , one obtains @xmath61 , \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 , \\\\ { \\lambda}^{\\rm{sma}}_{\\mathbf{k } } = & \\ , n e^{-|l{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 / 2 } v_c({\\mathbf{k } } ) + \\sum_{\\mathbf{q } } v_c({\\mathbf{q } } ) e^{-|l{\\mathbf{q}}|^2 / 2 } \\cos({\\mathbf{k } } \\wedge { \\mathbf{q } } ) , \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we have used the shorthand notation @xmath63 .",
    "diagonalising eq .   by means of a bogolyubov transformation one obtains @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the quasiparticle excitations",
    ". the bogolyubov spectrum has the familiar form @xmath66 taking the limit @xmath67 , @xmath68 reduces to the spectrum found within the rpa formalism .",
    "@xcite comparing the above calculation of the spectrum to the one performed in ref .",
    ", one sees that up to a minus sign , the same pseudospin mapping is used .",
    "the only difference is the manner of calculation : the former uses feynman diagrams , whereas the latter uses the approximately bosonic nature of the pseudospin waves . the predicted spectrum features a goldstone mode at @xmath69 , as found experimentally,@xcite but also a phase transition at @xmath70 , whereas experiments reveal the critical separation to lie at @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , the theoretically predicted phase transition is induced by a roton minimum touching the axis , whereas no roton has ever been observed , in spite of an extensive search.@xcite      recently , another approach has been presented , called _ bosonisation _ , which is also based on a pseudospin mapping and bosonic excitations.@xcite however , a different spin orientation is used : spin up ( down ) refers to an electron being in the upper ( lower ) layer instead of an ( anti)symmetric state .",
    "this spin mapping is useful , since it allows one to describe very directly the bec of excitons that has been observed experimentally .",
    "@xcite however , after the bosonisation procedure , the hamiltonian describes a system in which every second electron is part of a boson .",
    "this is problematic , because the bosonic operators were defined under the assumption that there would be few bosons : so few that they would locally only see the ( ferromagnetic ) ground state .    here",
    ", we will present a bosonisation scheme based on the s / as splitting discussed above , but still within the spin mapping used in ref .  .",
    "in this way , we end up with a system containing few bosons , maintaining the validity of the approximation , but the bosons being described are no longer the excitons observed in refs .  .    the ground state @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 , and antisymmetric excitations are created by the operator @xmath74 normalising @xmath75 in order to define a proper bosonic operator , we find @xmath76 note that @xmath77 is identical to @xmath78 .",
    "now , following ref .  , we find bosonic expressions for the operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which appear in the fermionic hamiltonian eq .  .",

    "the bosonic excitations being studied are the same ( both are antisymmetric excitations above a symmetric ground state ) , and the method is the same ( both are based on a pseudospin mapping ) , yet they yield different results . the origin of this apparent inconsistency can be found by expanding the hamiltonian in @xmath88-magnon states : @xmath89 having assumed a low enough magnon density for the magnon - magnon interaction to be negligible , we need only take this series up to @xmath90 . from the truncated series , let us investigate the term @xmath91 , or more specifically , the @xmath36-term @xmath92 expanding the brackets yields four terms , of which the one of interest is @xmath93 calculating the ground state expectation value @xmath94 by means of the lll projection algebra ( i.e. commuting @xmath95 ) yields @xmath96 , b^\\dag_{\\mathbf{q } } ] { | { \\chi}\\rangle } \\\\ = \\frac{1}{2 } & \\ , \\sum_{{\\mathbf{k } } , { \\mathbf{p } } , { \\mathbf{q } } } \\frac{e^{-|l{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 / 2}}{n } v_c({\\mathbf{k } } ) { \\langle { \\chi}| } [ b_{\\mathbf{p } } , b^\\dag_{\\mathbf{q } } ] { | { \\chi}\\rangle } \\\\ = \\frac{1}{2 } & \\ , \\sum_{{\\mathbf{k } } , { \\mathbf{p } } , { \\mathbf{q } } } e^{-|l{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 / 2 } { \\delta}_{{\\mathbf{p } } , { \\mathbf{q } } } v_c({\\mathbf{k}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is precisely the difference between the two approaches . in the bosonisation scheme , the commutator @xmath97 $ ] is replaced with its ground state expectation value , which is a number .",
    "hence , the outer commutators vanish , and the term does not enter the spectrum .",
    "a similar explanation holds for the difference between @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    in short : taking the series in eq .   up to @xmath90",
    ", we recover the results found by macdonald _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite the difference between the bosonisation scheme presented above and the one employed in ref",
    ".   arises from the fact that the former approximates the state of the system by the ground state already when evaluating the series in eq .  , whereas in the latter , this assumption is only made at the stage of the bogolyubov transformation .",
    "it should be noted that the difference between the two approaches has nothing to do with the different spin representations used .",
    "they can be transformed into each other by rotating the spins , but such a rotation does not have any effect on the physical quantities that can be calculated from the models .",
    "the representations are only different in the way in which they describe the physics , but not in the physical approximation that is made .",
    "the difference in results between sections [ secsma ] and [ secsasbos ] is purely a consequence of the different ways of calculating the bosonic hamiltonian that were used . in the following",
    ", we will use the single - mode approximation described in ref .  .",

    "let us construct a ground state with locally varying spin orientation , @xmath110 we will use the shorthand notation @xmath111 . the exponential rotates the spin at position @xmath112 by an angle @xmath113 .",
