    "one of the most interesting features of the inelastic neutron scattering in lanthanum cuprates is that for hole concentrations @xmath12 , low temperatures and small energy transfers the scattering is peaked at incommensurate momenta @xmath2 , @xmath3 in the reciprocal lattice units @xmath13 with the lattice period @xmath14.@xcite for @xmath15 the incommensurability parameter @xmath16 is approximately equal to @xmath17.@xcite for larger @xmath17 the parameter saturates near the value @xmath18 .",
    "the incommensurate response was observed both below and above @xmath19.@xcite recently the analogous low - frequency incommensurability was observed also in yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8.@xcite this gives ground to suppose that the incommensurability is a common feature of cuprate perovskites which does not depend on subtle details of the energy structure .",
    "however , for larger frequencies the susceptibility differs essentially in these two types of cuprates . in the underdoped yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 and some other cuprates both below and above @xmath19 a pronounced maximum",
    "is observed at frequencies @xmath20  mev.@xcite in the momentum space the magnetic response is sharply peaked at the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath21 for this frequency .",
    "contrastingly , no maximum at @xmath22 was observed in lanthanum cuprates .",
    "instead for low temperatures and frequencies of several millielectronvolts a broad feature was detected.@xcite for even larger frequencies the magnetic response becomes again incommensurate in both types of cuprates with peaks located at @xmath4 , @xmath23.@xcite in contrast to the low - frequency incommensurability in which the incommensurability parameter decreases with increasing frequency , the parameter of the high - frequency incommensurability grows or remains practically unchanged with frequency .",
    "thus , the dispersion of maxima in the susceptibility resembles two parabolas with upward- and downward - directed branches which converge at * q * and near the frequency @xmath22.@xcite    the nature of the magnetic incommensurability is the subject of active discussion now .",
    "the most frequently used approaches for its explanation are based on the picture of itinerant electrons with the susceptibility calculated in the random phase approximation@xcite and on the stripe domain picture.@xcite in the former approach the low - frequency incommensurability is connected with the fermi surface nesting in the normal state or with the nesting in constant - energy contours in the superconducting case .",
    "this imposes rather stringent requirements on the electron energy spectrum , since the nesting has to persist in the range of hole concentrations @xmath24 where the incommensurability is observed and the nesting momentum has to change in a specific manner with doping to ensure the known dependence of the incommensurability parameter @xmath16 on @xmath17 .",
    "it is unlikely that these conditions are fulfilled in la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11.@xcite besides , the applicability of the picture of itinerant electrons for underdoped cuprates casts doubts . as for the second notion , it should be noted that in the elastic neutron scattering the charge - density wave connected with stripes is observed only in crystals with the low - temperature tetragonal or the low - temperature less - orthorhombic phases ( la@xmath9ba@xmath10cuo@xmath11 and la@xmath25nd@xmath26sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11 ) and is not observed in the crystal la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11 in the low - temperature orthorhombic phase.@xcite at the same time the magnetic incommensurability is similar in these phases .",
    "it can be supposed that the magnetic incommensurability is the cause rather than the effect of stripes which are formed with an assistance of phonons .    in the present work the general formula for the magnetic susceptibility derived in the projection operator formalism@xcite",

    "the mentioned peculiarities of the magnetic properties of cuprates are reproduced including the proper frequency and momentum location of the susceptibility maxima .",
    "the incommensurability for @xmath27 is connected with the dispersion of spin excitations.@xcite the incommensurability for lower frequencies is related to the dip in the spin - excitation damping at @xmath28 . for small @xmath17",
    "the dip appears due to the nesting of the hole pockets around @xmath29 forming the fermi surface.@xcite for moderate doping this dip stems from the weakness of the interaction between the spin excitations and holes near the hot spots ",
    "the intersection points of the fermi surface and the boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "such a weak interaction follows from the fact that due to a short - range interaction between holes and spins a decaying site spin excitation creates a fermion pair with components residing on the same and neighbor sites .",
    "the spin - excitation damping was found to depend strongly on details of the hole dispersion , bandwidth and damping , so that the change in these characteristics leads to the conversion of well - defined spin excitations to overdamped ones . as this takes place , the frequency dependence of the susceptibility at * q *",
    "is transformed from a pronounced maximum@xcite at @xmath22 which is inherent in underdoped yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 to a broad low - frequency feature characteristic for lanthanum cuprates.@xcite the increased spin - excitation damping has no marked effect on the low - frequency incommensurability , however for @xmath27 the incommensurate peaks are shifted to * q * and form a broad maximum .",

    "mori s projection operator formalism and the @xmath0-@xmath1 model of cu - o planes were used for the interpretation of the magnetic susceptibility in normal - state cuprate perovskites .",
    "it was shown that the calculated momentum and frequency dependencies of the imaginary part of the susceptibility @xmath99 , the dispersion and location of maxima in it and the concentration dependence of the incommensurability parameter are similar to those observed in lanthanum and yttrium cuprates .",
    "the dispersion of the maxima in @xmath99 resembles two parabolas with upward- and downward - directed branches which converge at the antiferromagnetic wave vector * q * and at the respective frequency of spin excitations @xmath153 .",
    "this frequency corresponds to a local minimum in the dispersion of spin excitations and its value is connected with the correlation length of the short - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "we relate the upper parabola to the spin - excitation dispersion .",
    "the incommensurability connected with the lower parabola is related to the dip in the spin - excitation damping at * q*. for moderate doping the dip arises due to the smallness of the interaction between spin excitations and holes near the hot spots , which is a consequence of the short - range character of this interaction . in agreement with experiment",
    "the incommensurate peaks which form the lower parabola are located at momenta @xmath2 and @xmath3 , while peaks in the upper parabola are at @xmath4 and @xmath5 . also in agreement with experiment",
    "the low - frequency incommensurability parameter @xmath16 grows linearly with the hole concentration @xmath17 for @xmath171 and then saturates .",
    "this behavior of @xmath16 is mainly connected with the concentration dependence of the frequency @xmath153 of the spin gap at the antiferromagnetic wave vector .",
    "we found that the incommensurability for the transfer frequencies @xmath155 disappears if the damping of holes with energies @xmath192 is greater than @xmath166 .",
    "this incommensurability vanishes also when the chemical potential approaches the extended van hove singularities at @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "the incommensurability for @xmath157 disappears for large spin - excitation damping .",
    "the value of this damping depends heavily on the hole damping and on the shape and width of the hole band .",
    "we suppose that the marked difference in the frequency dependencies of the susceptibility in yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 and la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11  a pronounced peak at @xmath193  mev for @xmath109 in the former crystal and a broad feature at @xmath194  mev in the latter  is a consequence of the difference in the electron spectra .",
    "the larger spin - excitation damping in la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath11 leads to overdamping of spin excitations , while in the underdoped yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 the excitations are well - defined even in the normal state .",
