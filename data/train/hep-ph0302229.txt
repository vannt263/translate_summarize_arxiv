    "thanks to the efforts at the @xmath17 factories , the exploration of cp violation is now entering another exciting stage , allowing us to confront the kobayashi  maskawa mechanism @xcite with data . after the discovery of mixing - induced cp violation in the `` gold - plated '' mode @xmath25 @xcite , as well as important other measurements , one of the most interesting questions is now to what extent the possible space for new physics ( np ) has already been reduced . in this context , the central target is the unitarity triangle of the cabibbo  kobayashi",
    " maskawa ( ckm ) matrix illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ut](a ) , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the generalized wolfenstein parameters @xcite .",
    "the usual fits for the allowed region for the apex of the unitarity triangle in the @xmath5@xmath6 plane  the `` ckm fits ''  seem to indicate that no np is required to accommodate the data @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the complete answer to this exciting question . in order to fully address it ,",
    "the interpretation of the data on the mixing - induced cp asymmetry @xmath26 where @xmath7 is the cp - violating weak @xmath0@xmath1 mixing phase , requires a more involved analysis . within the standard model ( sm ) , @xmath7 is given by @xmath27 .",
    "however , due to the possible impact of physics beyond the sm , @xmath7 takes the following general form : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is due to non - standard contributions to @xmath0@xmath1 mixing , which is the preferred mechanism for np to manifest itself in ( [ amix - bdpsiks ] ) . in principle , physics beyond the sm may also affect the @xmath30 decay amplitudes ; however , in this case the new contributions have to compete with sm tree - level amplitudes and their relative impact is expected to be much smaller .",
    "so far , a set of `` smoking - gun '' observables to search for such kind of np does not indicate any deviation from the sm @xcite .    obviously ,",
    "because of the @xmath29 term in ( [ phid - np ] ) , we may not convert the experimental information on @xmath7 into a constraint on @xmath11 in the presence of np contributions to @xmath31@xmath32 mixing . moreover",
    ", we may not use the sm interpretation of the @xmath33 mass differences @xmath34 to determine the unitarity - triangle side @xmath35 as recently discussed in @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the determination of the side @xmath36 by means of exclusive and inclusive transitions of the type @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which are dominated by sm tree - level amplitudes , is very robust as far as the impact of np is concerned @xcite .",
    "a determination of the `` true '' unitarity triangle in the presence of a completely general np model , i.e.  with arbitrary flavour - mixing terms , is almost impossible .",
    "however , we may still perform useful predictive analyses within certain scenarios for physics beyond the sm , for example within models with `` minimal flavour violation '' ( mfv ) , where the only source for flavour mixing is still given by the ckm matrix ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in the present paper we go one step beyond the mfv models : we analyse a scenario with large generic np contributions to @xmath0@xmath1 mixing ( @xmath39 ) , eventually also to @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , but _ not _ to the @xmath2 and @xmath42 decay amplitudes .",
    "as we shall demonstrate , this scenario is well motivated by simple dimensional arguments in a wide class of models , including supersymmetric frameworks .",
    "if we assume np of this kind , we may complement the experimental information on @xmath7 with data on cp violation in @xmath9 to extract @xmath12 , and may then fix the `` true '' apex of the unitarity triangle with the help of the side @xmath43 . needless to note , we may then also extract @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "several years ago , assuming also such a np scenario but neglecting penguin effects , it was already pointed out in @xcite that it is actually possible to determine the unitarity triangle  up to discrete ambiguities  by combining the cp - violating observables of @xmath25 and @xmath9 decays with @xmath43 .",
    "since we have now strong experimental and theoretical indications for large penguin effects in @xmath9 , we must definitely care about them . to this end , we follow @xcite , and use data on the cp - averaged @xmath13 branching ratio , which allows us to control the penguin contributions with the help of plausible dynamical assumptions and @xmath44-spin flavour - symmetry arguments . employing `` qcd factorization '' to deal with the penguins topologies @xcite , a similar analysis was also performed in @xcite .",
    "further alternative strategies to extract physics information from @xmath7 , @xmath43 , and cp violation in @xmath9 can be found , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "another important aspect of our analysis are the very rare decays @xmath21 and @xmath20 . using the allowed ranges for the generalized wolfenstein parameters obtained from the strategy sketched above , we are able to predict the branching ratios for these modes independently of possible np contributions to @xmath0@xmath1 mixing . as we shall show , these predictions could be very different from the sm expectations .",
    "= 7.0 truecm    = 7.0 truecm    the outline of this paper is as follows : a closer look at @xmath7 , @xmath43 and @xmath11 is presented in section  [ sec : phid ] . in section  [ sec : np ] , we motivate the scenario where np manifests itself only through contributions to @xmath0@xmath1 mixing . in section",
    "[ sec : ut - det ] , we discuss how we may determine the `` true '' unitarity triangle for this kind of np with the help of cp violation in @xmath9 .",
    "the implications for the rare decays @xmath21 and @xmath20 are presented in section  [ sec : rare ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : concl ] with a short summary of our results and a brief outlook .",
    "the present world average for @xmath45 , determined from mixing - induced cp violation in @xmath25 and similar modes , is @xmath46 @xcite , which implies @xmath47 here the former solution would be in perfect agreement with the `` indirect '' range implied by the ckm fits , @xmath48 @xcite , whereas the latter would show a significant discrepancy .",
    "measuring the sign of @xmath49 , both solutions can be distinguished .",
    "there are several strategies on the market to accomplish this important task @xcite .",
    "for example , in the @xmath30 system , @xmath50 can be extracted from the time - dependent angular distribution of the decay products of @xmath51 k^\\ast[\\to\\pi^0k_{\\rm s}]$ ] , if the sign of a hadronic parameter @xmath52 , involving a strong phase @xmath53 , is fixed through factorization @xcite .",
    "this analysis is already in progress at the @xmath17 factories @xcite .    in this context , it is important to note that the ckm factor @xmath43 introduced in ( [ rb - def ] ) allows us to obtain the following bounds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ut]a ) : @xmath54 using the rather conservative experimental range @xmath55 which corresponds to @xmath56 , we obtain latexmath:[\\[\\label{beta - bound }    @xmath43 from semileptonic @xmath17 decays , which originate from tree - level sm processes , appears to be very robust as far as the impact of np is concerned , we may consider ( [ beta - bound ] ) as an upper bound for the `` true '' angle @xmath11 of the unitarity triangle . consequently",
    ", as we have @xmath58 within the sm , ( [ beta - bound ] ) implies latexmath:[\\[\\label{phid - sm - bound }    former solution @xmath14 in ( [ phid - exp ] ) satisfies this bound nicely , this is definitely not the case for @xmath15 .",
    "the latter solution can not be accommodated in the sm and requires np contributions to @xmath0@xmath1 mixing , i.e.  we now need @xmath60 in ( [ phid - np ] ) . at this point ,",
    "the important question of how we may represent this second solution in the @xmath5@xmath6 plane arises . in the literature , this is usually simply done through a second branch , corresponding to @xmath61 as we have shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ut](b ) .",
    "however , because of ( [ phid - np ] ) , this is actually _ not _ correct .",
    "moreover , since @xmath15 is associated with np contributions to @xmath0@xmath1 mixing , we may _ no longer _ use the sm interpretation of @xmath62 and @xmath63 to determine the side @xmath64 of the unitarity triangle .",
    "in particular , we may no longer conclude from the experimental lower bound on @xmath65 that @xmath66 .",
    "it is important to note that ( [ phid - np ] ) applies to @xmath67 as well , so that np may  at least in principle  hide itself in this case , despite the striking consistency with the sm interpretation of other observables .",
    "as already pointed out , one of the key ingredients to determine the `` true '' apex of the unitarity triangle without using information on @xmath0@xmath1 mixing is the side @xmath43 .",
    "if we complement it with a measurement of @xmath12 , we may determine the coordinates of the apex of the unitarity triangle straightforwardly through @xmath68from a theoretical point of view , certain pure `` tree '' decays would be best suited for the determination of @xmath12 , allowing theoretically clean extractions of this angle that would also be very robust under the impact of np ( see , for instance , @xcite).@xmath69 mixing .",
    "however , it could then be taken into account through a measurement of the corresponding mixing parameters @xcite . ]",
    "a similar comment applies to the new strategies that were recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "here decays of the kind @xmath70 and @xmath71 are employed .",
    "if we use the @xmath72@xmath73 mixing phase @xmath74 as an input , and observe the neutral @xmath75 mesons through their decays into cp - even and cp - odd eigenstates , certain `` untagged '' and mixing - induced observables allow a very efficient , theoretically clean determination of @xmath12 in an essentially unambiguous manner @xcite ; alternatively , we may also employ decays of the neutral @xmath75 mesons into cp non - eigenstates to this end @xcite .",
    "these strategies appear to be particularly interesting for the next generation of dedicated @xmath17 experiments , lhcb and btev , as well as those at super-@xmath17 factories , although important steps may already be made at babar and belle .",
    "since we can not yet confront these methods with data , we have to employ alternative strategies to extract @xmath12 . in this context",
    ", @xmath9 offers a very interesting tool .",
    "if we use @xmath7 as an input , and employ the cp - averaged @xmath13 branching ratio to control the penguin effects @xcite , we may determine @xmath12 from the cp - violating @xmath9 observables for each of the two solutions given in ( [ phid - exp ] ) @xcite ; using `` qcd factorization '' @xcite to deal with the penguin effects , such an exercise was also performed in @xcite . in the future , the @xmath9 observables can be fully exploited with the help of @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the pure tree decays mentioned above , these modes may in principle well be affected by new physics , as they receive contributions from loop - induced flavour - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) amplitudes .",
    "however , as we shall discuss in the next section , there is a particularly interesting class of extensions of the sm where new physics yields sizeable contributions to @xmath0@xmath1 mixing only , leaving the decay amplitudes  including the loop - induced ones  almost unaffected .",
    "as far as flavour physics is concerned , extensions of the sm can be classified into two wide categories : models with minimal flavour violation and models with new sources of flavour mixing . within the highly - constrained class of mfv models , the only source of flavour - symmetry breaking terms is given by the sm yukawa couplings @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , all flavour - changing transitions are still ruled by the ckm matrix .",
    "for this reason , many of the standard ckm constraints hold also in mfv models : the determination of @xmath64 in terms of @xmath63 is still valid  @xcite , and the relation between @xmath45 and @xmath77 can differ at most by an overall sign  @xcite , i.e.  @xmath78 or @xmath79 .",
    "it is then easy to realize that within mfv models the structure of the unitarity triangle is fixed  up to a twofold ambiguity  even without @xmath9 data , and that there is no room for the non - standard solution @xmath80 .",
    "in the wide class of models with new sources of flavour mixing , it is rather natural to expect extra @xmath81 contributions to the @xmath82@xmath83  amplitude , with arbitrary phases , so that we may accommodate any value of @xmath29 .",
    "it is also very natural to assume that these np effects have a negligible impact on @xmath2 amplitudes dominated by tree - level sm contributions ; this happens essentially in all realistic models . on the other hand",
    ", it is less obvious why these new sources of flavour - symmetry breaking  being able to induce @xmath81 corrections to @xmath82@xmath83  mixing  should have a small impact on @xmath2 amplitudes arising only at the loop level within the sm .",
    "this hypothesis , which is one of the main assumptions of the present analysis , certainly does not represent the most general np scenario .",
    "however , as we shall discuss in the following , it can be realized under rather general conditions .",
    "the generic np scenario we shall advocate is a model where non - standard effects are negligible in all amplitudes that receive tree - level sm contributions ( independently of possible ckm suppressions ) .",
    "moreover , in order to protect the effects on @xmath2 fcnc amplitudes , we shall add the following two general requirements :    1 .",
    "the effective scale of np is substantially higher than the electroweak scale ; 2 .   the adimensional effective couplings ruling @xmath39 transitions can always be expressed as the square of two @xmath2 effective couplings .    employing an effective - theory language",
    ", what we mean under these two hypotheses is that the generic dimension - six operators encoding np contributions to @xmath82@xmath83  and @xmath84 transitions can be written as q^np_b=2 = ( d ) ( d ) , q^np_b=1 = ( d ) ( q ) , [ eq : npops ] where @xmath85 denotes the new @xmath2 effective flavour - changing coupling , @xmath86 indicates generic dirac and/or colour structures , and possible coefficient functions of @xmath81 have been ignored . coherently with the requirement ii ) , we shall also assume that @xmath87-breaking operators of dimension less than six , such as the chromomagnetic operator , play a negligible role .",
    "the overall normalization of the two operators in ( [ eq : npops ] ) , or the definition of the effective scale @xmath88 , has been chosen such that the corresponding sm @xmath39 term is q^sm_b=2 = ( d ) ( d ) .",
    "[ eq : normal2 ] choosing this normalization , we have implicitly factorized out an overall coefficient of @xmath89 $ ] in the effective hamiltonian , both in the @xmath39 and in the @xmath2 cases . as a result , within the sm",
    ", the loop - induced @xmath2 operators can be written as q^sm_b=1 = c ( d ) ( q ) , [ eq : normal1 ] where the coefficient function @xmath90 is of @xmath81 in the case of pure short - distance - dominated electroweak operators ( such as those generated by @xmath91-penguin and @xmath92-box diagrams ) and substantially larger than unity for those that receive large logarithmic corrections via rge .",
    "note that the normalization of the np contributions in ( [ eq : normal2 ] ) does not necessarily imply that they are generated only by loop amplitudes at the fundamental level : their natural size is comparable to that of sm loop amplitudes , but they could well be induced by tree - level processes .",
    "for instance , a model with a heavy @xmath93 boson with a fcnc coupling to the @xmath94 current would also perfectly fit in this scheme , and in this case _ both _ @xmath95 and @xmath96 would receive tree - level contributions .",
    "what we can not accommodate in this scheme is the possibility that @xmath95 receives large tree - level contributions and @xmath96 only loop - induced ones : in our language , this case would correspond to a violation of the condition ii ) .",
    "since the measurement of the @xmath0@xmath1 mass difference falls in the ballpark of the sm expectations , the new flavour - changing coupling @xmath85 can not be arbitrarily large : barring fine - tuned scenarios with severe cancellations among different terms , we can allow at most @xmath81 corrections to the sm amplitude .",
    "this implies ( see also @xcite ) 1 , [ eq : cond ] where possible @xmath81 factors associated with the matrix elements of the operators have been neglected .",
    "owing to the different parametric dependence from scale factor and flavour - changing coupling of @xmath39 and @xmath2 operators in ( [ eq : npops ] ) , if the condition ( [ eq : cond ] ) is fulfilled the corresponding non - standard effects induced in @xmath2 flavour - changing neutral - current transitions turn out to be suppressed at least by a factor @xmath97 relative to the sm level : 1 .",
    "[ eq : cond2 ] since the coefficient @xmath90 is substantially larger than 1 for qcd - penguin amplitudes , the suppression is even more severe in this case .",
    "we have thus obtained a natural justification for the smallness of non - standard effects in @xmath2 loop - induced amplitudes in the well - motivated scenario of a heavy np scale ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "although rather qualitative , the above argument has the great advantage of being almost independent of the details of the np model .",
    "indeed , it can be realized in very different frameworks , from low - energy supersymmetry to models with large extra dimensions .",
    "as can be easily understood , this argument does not apply only to @xmath0@xmath1 mixing : it is characteristic of any type of @xmath99 meson  antimeson mixing versus the corresponding @xmath100 loop - induced amplitudes , provided the corresponding assumption ii ) is fulfilled . for this reason , in the phenomenological determination of the ckm matrix of section  [ sec : ut - det ] , we shall try to avoid the use of observables such as @xmath40 or @xmath65 , which are sensitive to the @xmath101@xmath102 and @xmath103@xmath104 mixing amplitudes , respectively .    in principle",
    ", the case of @xmath105 transitions is somehow different from the @xmath106 and @xmath107 ones , since the @xmath103@xmath104 mass difference has not yet been measured .",
    "this is indeed one of the reasons why speculations about possible large np effects in penguin - mediated @xmath105 transitions , such as @xmath108 and  especially @xmath109  are still very popular ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , we recall that the available data on @xmath65 already show a preference for this observable to be close to its sm expectation @xcite .",
    "if we assume that np effects in @xmath65 can be at most of @xmath81 , we can accommodate large np effects in @xmath105 transitions only by means of violations of the conditions i ) and ii ) @xcite , or by fine - tuning .",
    "therefore , in order to understand the consistency of our scenario , it will be very interesting to follow the evolution of future measurements of @xmath110 and @xmath109 decays .",
    "so far , the available data on the @xmath108 observables fall well into the sm - allowed regions in observable space @xcite . in particular , they do not indicate any anomalous behaviour of the @xmath13 mode , which will be used in section  [ sec : ut - det ] to control the penguin effects in @xmath9 .    to conclude this general discussion",
    ", it is worth stressing that this mechanism is not representative of all possible models with new sources of flavour mixing .",
    "as already mentioned , the condition ii ) is not necessarily fulfilled . moreover",
    ", a large hierarchy of matrix elements could invalidate the conditions ( [ eq : cond ] ) and ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) .",
    "this happens , for instance , in supersymmetry with specific choices of the soft - breaking terms .",
    "however , as we shall discuss in the following , it is very natural to assume that this mechanism works also within supersymmetric models , so that the largest np effects appear only in @xmath99 amplitudes .      among specific extensions of the sm , low - energy supersymmetry is certainly one of the most interesting and well - motivated possibilities . in the absence of a mfv pattern for the soft - breaking terms ,",
    "sizeable modifications of fcnc amplitudes are naturally expected within this framework , and the mass - insertion approximation provides a very efficient tool to describe them  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric contributions to @xmath82@xmath83  mixing have been widely discussed in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and there exist several possibilities to accommodate arbitrary values of @xmath29 .",
    "for instance , we can simply adjust the coupling @xmath111 ( or , equivalently , @xmath112 ) to produce the desired modification of @xmath82@xmath83 mixing via gluino - mediated box diagrams . in this case",
    "the sum of supersymmetric and sm contributions to @xmath82@xmath83  mixing can be written as m_d e^-i_d & & _ b s_0(x_t ) | ( _ l _ d_l)^2 | b_d^0 + & & \\",
    "{ ^2 + r _ ^2 } , [ eq : bb_susy ] where @xmath113 and @xmath114 denote the initial condition and leading qcd corrections of the sm wilson coefficient , respectively ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the explicit expression for @xmath115  the supersymmetric loop function depending on the ratio @xmath116 of squark and gluino masses  and the corresponding qcd correction factor @xmath117 can be found in @xcite . as a reference figure , note that @xmath118 , and that we can set , to a good approximation , @xmath119 .    expression ( [ eq : bb_susy ] ) provides a simple realization of the general scenario discussed in the previous subsection , with the adimensional effective flavour - changing coupling given by @xmath120 , and the effective np scale given by ^susy_eff = | |^1/2 1.4  tev ( ) . according to condition ( [ eq : cond ] ) ,",
    "corrections to @xmath82@xmath83  mixing of @xmath81 should be obtained for @xmath121 : this expectation is fully confirmed by the detailed analysis of @xcite . as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "since sm and supersymmetric loop functions have the same sign , ; however , it holds for @xmath122 , which is suggested by rge constraints in grand - unified scenarios  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath123 must have a large imaginary part if the sm term gives too large a @xmath124 , as in the case where the `` true value '' of @xmath12 lies in the second quadrant .",
    "interestingly , as we shall see in the following section , this scenario is the favoured one for @xmath80 .",
    "owing to the general dimensional argument in ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) , a supersymmetric framework with @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the only new source of flavour - symmetry breaking , leads to negligible effects in @xmath127 transitions .",
    "this can be explicitly verified by means of @xcite in the case of electroweak penguin amplitudes of the type @xmath128 , or by means of @xcite in the case of @xmath129 transitions . according to these analyses , if @xmath125 and if we have only left ",
    "left mass insertions , the supersymmetric corrections to electroweak penguin amplitudes reach at most the level of a few per cent with respect to the sm contributions .",
    "these results are particularly important for the discussion of rare decays in section  [ sec : rare ] : they show that it is perfectly conceivable to have a scenario where the np corrections to @xmath0@xmath1 mixing are large , but the direct np contributions to the rare decay amplitudes are negligible .    within this framework ,",
    "i.e.  with heavy squark masses and non - standard sources of flavour - symmetry breaking induced only by left ",
    "left mass insertions , the relative impact of non - standard effects is even smaller for non - leptonic qcd - penguin amplitudes , such as those contributing to @xmath130 and @xmath13 decays . indeed , in this case the sm contribution",
    "is substantially enhanced by the coupling constant and by large ( infra - red ) logarithms  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "as already mentioned in the general discussion , we recall that this framework is not representative of all possible supersymmetric scenarios .",
    "for instance , it is well known that by means of flavour - non - diagonal @xmath131 terms , i.e.  mass insertions of the left ",
    "right type , we can generate sizeable effects in @xmath100 transitions  in particular rare decays  without contradicting the @xmath99 bounds @xcite .",
    "this happens because we may generate by means of left ",
    "right mass insertions sizeable contributions to @xmath132-breaking @xmath100 operators , which allow us to evade condition ii ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , condition ii ) is badly violated by higgs - mediated fcnc amplitudes in large @xmath133 scenarios ( see , in particular , @xcite ) . also in this case the reason is intimately related to an interplay between flavour- and electroweak - symmetry breaking  @xcite .    to summarize",
    ", we can state that the scenario with large non - standard effects only in @xmath99 amplitudes is characteristic of supersymmetric models with : i ) a heavy scale for the soft - breaking terms , ii ) new sources of flavour - symmetry breaking only ( or mainly ) in the soft - breaking terms which do not involve the higgs fields , iii ) yukawa interactions very similar to the pure sm case .",
    "let us now assume that we have np of the kind specified in the previous section .",
    "we may then complement the experimentally determined @xmath0@xmath1 mixing phase @xmath7 and the ckm factor @xmath43 with data on cp violation in the @xmath17-factory benchmark mode @xmath9 to fix the apex of the `` true '' unitarity triangle in the @xmath5@xmath6 plane .",
    "the decay @xmath134 originates from @xmath135 quark - level transitions . within the sm and the scenario for",

    "we observe that actually the phases @xmath7 and @xmath12 enter directly in the @xmath9 observables , and not @xmath10 .",

    "direct cp violation at this level would require large penguin contributions with large cp - conserving strong phases .",
    "interestingly , a significant impact of penguins on @xmath9 is also indicated by data on the @xmath144 branching ratios @xcite , as well as by theoretical considerations @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is already evident that the penguin contributions to @xmath9 _ can not _ be neglected .      over the recent years",
    ", many approaches to control the impact of the penguin contributions on the extraction of weak phases from the cp - violating @xmath9 observables were proposed ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
