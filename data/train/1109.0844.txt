    "membrane vesicles are made of a closed bilayer of amphiphilic molecules in aqueous solution , having length scales of @xmath0@xmath1 @xmath2 m .",
    "used as simplified models of biological membranes , they have been one of the most extensively studied systems in soft - matter physics @xcite .",
    "vesicles usually enclose both solvent ( water ) and solute molecules .",
    "such vesicular capsules are ubiquitous in cell functions @xcite and used as microreactors and delivery vehicles in various biomedical and cosmetic applications @xcite .",
    "the hydrophobic core of the bilayer membrane poses a kinetic barrier to the permeation of water and water - soluble molecules into and out of the vesicle .",
    "consequently , the permeability coefficients of various solutes across various membranes span a very wide range of values @xcite .",
    "for example , the permeability coefficients of water , urea , and potassium ions through the membranes used in the current work are of the order , respectively , of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 @xmath2 m/s @xcite .",
    "this implies that the time scales for permeation of water and the solutes examined here are well separated .",
    "thus , the vesicles can safely be assumed to reside in a semi - permeable regime , in which their volume quickly ( essentially immediately ) re - adjusts through osmosis to a change in the number of enclosed solute molecules . as more solute molecules enter , therefore , the vesicle progressively swells  first approaching a spherical shape ( the `` ironing '' stage ) , subsequently inflating as a sphere ( the stretching stage ) , and eventually rupturing ( osmotic lysis ) @xcite .    in an earlier theoretical work",
    "we argued that a vesicle in such a semi - permeable regime should reach the end of the ironing stage ( _ i.e. _ , the maximum volume - to - area ratio ) critically , through a continuous transition @xcite .",
    "that theory was restricted to unstretchable membranes . here",
    "we extend the theory to the experimentally relevant case of stretchable membranes , finding a slightly modified but similar form of criticality .",
    "we then confirm the existence of the critical scaling behavior in experiments and utilize it to obtain a reliable measurement of permeability coefficients .",
    "a crossover between two stages of vesicle swelling is well known in micropipette - aspiration experiments @xcite .",
    "the stages are distinguished by a markedly different dependence of surface tension on surface strain  in the first stage the dependence is exponential , while in the second it is linear @xcite .",
    "the essential difference between this scenario and the one addressed here lies in the different control parameters . in the former case",
    "the swelling is controlled by a hydrostatic pressure difference , whereas in the latter it is controlled by the number of encapsulated solute molecules . as a result ,",
    "the two crossovers are not equivalent .",
    "as will be presented below , in fact , the monitored swelling of our vesicles , with its two distinct stages , occurs within the linear regime_i.e .",

    "all the solutions were prepared in double - distilled sterile water .    a suspension of popc giant unilamellar vesicles ( guvs ) in 0.1 or 0.2  mol / l 1:1 sucrose / glucose solution was prepared using an electroformation method , described in ref .   with some modifications @xcite .",
    "lipids were dissolved in a mixture of chloroform / methanol ( 2:1 , v / v ) to a concentration of 1  mg / ml . a volume of 25  @xmath2l of the lipid solution was spread onto a pair of pt electrodes and dried under reduced pressure ( water aspirator ; @xmath6  mmhg ) for 2  hours .",
    "the electrodes were then placed into an electroformation chamber , which was filled with 0.1 or 0.2  mol / l sucrose . ac current ( 8  v , 10  hz ) was applied , and the voltage and frequency were reduced in steps to the final values of 1  v and 1  hz @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the chamber was first drained into a beaker and then flushed with an equal volume of isomolar glucose solution , thus resulting in a suspension of guvs containing entrapped sucrose in a 1:1 sucrose / glucose solution , which increases the contrast in a phase contrast setup and facilitates vesicle manipulation @xcite .",

    "the camera provides @xmath7 12-bit grayscale images at a rate of 8.9  images / s .    in the experiment , an individual spherical guv is selected , fully aspirated into a glass micropipette whose inner diameter exceeds the vesicle s diameter , and transferred from a solution containing solutes of very low membrane permeability ( 1:1 glucose / sucrose ) into an iso - osmolar solution of a more permeable solute ( glycerol , urea , or ethylene glycol ) , where the content of the micropipette is released , and the micropipette is subsequently removed .",

    "gravity should lead to a small deviation of the shape from a perfect oblate spheroid @xcite , which we neglect here .",
    "a more important effect of gravity is the breaking of the problem s rotational symmetry , such that the observed lateral radius , @xmath8 , is always the spheroid s larger radius . on a longer time scale than the transient deflation",

    "models of vesicles usually focus on the statistical mechanics of the membrane under the appropriate constraints , the starting point being the helfrich hamiltonian @xcite . in the current work",
    "we choose a different , more general description , based on the thermodynamics of small systems @xcite .",
    "this is because the phenomenon of main interest here  the transition between the ironing and stretching stages  arises from competition between volume and surface effects , which is independent of the detailed interactions .",
    "since the transition is of a mean - field type @xcite , such a thermodynamic description should be sufficient .",
    "we consider a dilute solution enclosed in a membrane vesicle .",
    "this system is in thermal and pressure contact with a much larger solution having temperature @xmath16 and pressure @xmath17 .",
    "the system is at thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "thus , its temperature is @xmath16 .",
    "however , since we deal with strong surface effects , the system s equilibrium pressure may deviate from the outer pressure @xmath17 .",
    "the enclosed solution contains @xmath18 solute molecules.in the experiment described above the vesicle actually contains two solutes  one that permeates the membrane and another that is trapped inside the vesicle .",
    "analysis for an ideal solution , containing @xmath19 molecules of the former and @xmath20 molecules of the latter , leads to identical results once we take @xmath21 .",
    "although @xmath18 in the experiment changes with time , we assume , because the solute has much lower permeability than water , that the system is at all times in quasi - equilibrium , given the instantaneous number of enclosed solute molecules , @xmath22 . due to the fast water exchange , we treat both the volume @xmath23 and surface area @xmath24 of the vesicle as free , independent thermodynamic variables .",
    "alternatively , one can define a reduced volume , @xmath25 which characterizes the deviation of the vesicle from a perfect spherical shape , and consider @xmath26 and @xmath24 as the thermodynamic variables .",
    "we divide the gibbs free energy of the system into three - dimensional ( volume ) and two - dimensional ( surface ) contributions : @xmath27 taking the enclosed solution to be ideal and dilute , we write its gibbs free energy as @xmath28 + { p_{\\rm o}}v , \\label{g3d}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the molecular volume of water .    as to the surface",

    "i.e. _ , contribute additively to the helmholtz free energy , @xmath30 we further assume that the membrane s in - plane free energy is minimum for a certain relaxed area , @xmath31 , and expand it to leading order about that minimum , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the membrane s stretching modulus . in the bending free energy",
    "we include only the contribution from undulation entropy , which , assuming small fluctuations about a spherical shape , is given by @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the total number of independent bending modes contributing to the membrane s thermodynamics .",
    "equation ( [ bendentropy ] ) , which describes the suppression of bending fluctuations as the vesicle approaches the maximum volume - to - area ratio ( @xmath36 ) , is the only statistical - mechanical input to the theory .",
    "it is analogous to an equipartition principle ; here each bending mode contributes an equal amount of @xmath37 to the free energy @xcite .",
    "thus , this expression holds quite generally for nearly spherical vesicles , regardless of their detailed properties .",
    "equation ( [ bendentropy ] ) also provides the crucial coupling between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , since @xmath26 depends on both @xmath23 and @xmath24 according to eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .    the number of modes affecting the thermodynamics , @xmath35 , which should be proportional to the number of lipid molecules in the membrane ( _ i.e. _ , to the membrane s relaxed area @xmath31 ) , is _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "further discussion of this number , its dependence on membrane s parameters , and its link to other theoretical treatments of membrane fluctuations , is deferred to sec .",
    "[ sec_discuss ] . here",
    "we prefer to leave it unspecified and extract it from the experiment .",
    "the number of modes is used to define an intensive area , or effective patch size , @xmath40 , having the relaxed value @xmath41 .",
    "one could add , of course , various other contributions to the free energy of the vesicle , such as the membrane s bending energy , surface  surface and surface  solute interactions ( _ e.g. _ , electrostatic ones ) , gravitational energy , _ etc._. all these , however , do not significantly change when the vesicle becomes spherical and begins to stretch . in other words , in the limit ( to be studied below ) where @xmath42 becomes singular , these contributions are non - singular , and , hence , can not affect the critical behavior in the transition region .",
    "equations ( [ g])([bendentropy ] ) define the gibbs free energy of our finite - size system as a function of @xmath43 and also @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the equilibrium free energy as a function of @xmath43 alone is obtained by minimizing @xmath44 with respect to the volume and area of the vesicle .",
    "note that by using this procedure we circumvent altogether the subtle and controversial issue of membrane tension .",

    "the laplace tension and surface pressure of the membrane emerge naturally from the minimization with respect to @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "that is also the reason why we have formulated the helmholtz ( rather than gibbs ) free energy of the surface , to avoid specifying any thermodynamic variables pertaining to the surface other than @xmath16 , @xmath24 , and @xmath35 .",
    "another related subtlety is that @xmath45 at fixed @xmath26 ( rather than fixed @xmath23 ) , otherwise there would be another contribution to the stretching modulus from changes in the volume - to - area ratio .",
    "the minimization leads to the following two equations : @xmath46 from which one can calculate @xmath26 and @xmath47 . in eqs.([minimization1 ] ) and ( [ minimization2 ] ) we have defined @xmath48 along with two small parameters , @xmath49 the first related to the vesicle s finite size , and the other to the membrane s finite stretchability .    before proceeding , it is instructive to examine eqs.([minimization1 ] ) and ( [ minimization2 ] ) in two limits .",
    "the first is the ordinary thermodynamic limit of infinite system size ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) while keeping the stretching modulus finite . in this case",
    "( [ minimization1 ] ) and ( [ minimization2 ] ) become degenerate and yield the expected equilibration of inner and outer pressures , @xmath52 .",
    "the second limit is that of an unstretchable membrane ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) . in this case",
    "( [ minimization2 ] ) imposes @xmath55 , and eq .",
    "( [ minimization1 ] ) then yields the behavior that was studied in ref .  , with criticality of @xmath26 as @xmath50 .",
    "outside these two limits we get from these equations the relation @xmath56 which demonstrates the actual interplay between the volume - to - area ratio and surface strain .",
    "we see that the vesicle can never attain a perfect spherical shape ( @xmath57 ) , because this would require unphysical strain ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the deviation of the area from its relaxed value is inversely proportional to the deviation of the shape from a perfect sphere .",
    "this relation becomes more sensitive the smaller the value of @xmath59_i.e .",
    "_ , the vesicle should be strongly swollen , @xmath60 , to get an appreciable strain @xmath61 .    to present the detailed behavior of the transition",

    "similarly , combining eqs.([minimization1 ] ) , ( [ v_a_relation ] ) , and ( [ scaling1 ] ) , we get for the laplace tension , @xmath80^{-1 } = k\\epsilon(q ) , \\label{gamma}\\ ] ] _ i.e. _ , the surface tension follows the same behavior as the strain , becoming appreciable only for sufficiently large , positive @xmath62 .",
    "equation ( [ gamma ] ) implies that within the transition region the tension is in the so - called linear regime @xcite , where it is proportional to the surface strain .",
    "substituting the rupture strain found above , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 mn / m @xcite , we obtain a rupture tension of order @xmath83 mn / m , which is in line with previously reported values of @xmath84@xmath83 mn / m @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ scaling1 ] ) [ equivalently , ( [ scaling_epsilon ] ) or ( [ gamma ] ) ] describes a law of corresponding states for osmotically swollen , nearly spherical vesicles .",
    "it predicts that , upon rescaling , the swelling ( _ i.e. _ , volume - to - area ratio , strain , or tension ) of such vesicles , regardless of their size , composition , and the nature or concentration of solute , could be collapsed onto a single universal curve defined by the function @xmath85 .",
    "thus , despite the many physical parameters affecting the process , only two parameters actually suffice to completely characterize the osmotic swelling of any nearly spherical vesicle  the location of the transition , @xmath86 , and its width , @xmath68",
    ".    an interesting consequence of the competition between surface and volume effects is found when we examine the vesicle s swelling beyond the transition , well into the stretching stage . in this case , @xmath87 , eq .  ( [ scaling_epsilon ] )",

    "( [ epsilon_stretch ] ) , the relatively small value of @xmath33 in this case makes the swelling beyond the transition insensitive to @xmath33 .",
    "being governed by volume effects , the growth in the stretching stage is then simply proportional to the increasing number of enclosed molecules @xcite .",

    "we should merely replace the solute contribution to the gibbs free energy ( the first term in eq .  ( [ g3d ] ) ) , with @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the inner hydrostatic pressure . repeating the minimization procedure presented in sec.[sec_theory ]",

    "another way to demonstrate the non - criticality of the hydrostatic - pressure case is to recognize that , once both @xmath17 and @xmath138 are specified , the surface tension of a nearly spherical vesicle is simply given by laplace s law rather than the more elaborate critical expressions of eqs .",

    "this underlines the special thermodynamic behavior of osmotically stressed vesicles , as was indicated before in a more general statistical - mechanical context @xcite .",

    "the affinity should make the solute concentration adjacent to the membrane larger than in the bulk solution , leading to an apparent permeability coefficient which is larger than the actual one .",
    "more extensive measurements of the apparent permeability as a function of concentration might allow an extraction of the solute  membrane affinity parameters . at higher concentrations",
