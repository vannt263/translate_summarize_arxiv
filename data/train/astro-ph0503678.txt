    "the interaction of the outgoing supernova ( sn ) shock and ejecta with the circumstellar medium ( csm ) can produce substantial amounts of x - ray emission .",
    "the dominant x - ray production mechanism is the interaction of the sn shock with the ambient csm deposited either by a pre - sn stellar wind or non - conservative mass transfer to a companion .",
    "this interaction produces hot gas with a characteristic temperature in the range @xmath13@xmath14  k ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) .",
    "gas heated to such a high temperature produces radiation predominantly in the x - ray range .",
    "x - ray emission from this interaction is expected for all type ib / c and ii sne with substantial csm established by the massive progenitors .",
    "the details of the csm interaction are discussed in fransson , lundqvist & chevalier @xcite and references therein , while the x - ray interaction luminosity is briefly summarized here ( see also immler & lewin 2003 ) : the thermal x - ray luminosity , @xmath15 , produced by the shock heated csm , can be expressed as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mean mass per particle ( @xmath18  kg for a h+he plasma ) , @xmath19 the cooling function of the heated plasma at temperature @xmath20 , @xmath21 the mass - loss rate of the progenitor , @xmath22 the speed of the stellar wind blown off by the progenitor , and @xmath23 the speed of the outgoing shock . if x - ray spectroscopic data are available , @xmath19 is known , and the interaction luminosity @xmath15 at time @xmath24 after the outburst can be used to measure the ratio @xmath25 . assuming a constant sn shock velocity @xmath23 ,",
    "the shock will reach a radius of @xmath26 from the site of the explosion at time @xmath24 after the explosion .",
    "if the csm density @xmath27 is dominated by a wind from the progenitor of the sn , the continuity equation requires @xmath28 through a sphere of radius @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the stellar wind density . after the sn shock plows through the csm , its density is @xmath31 ( fransson , lundqvist & chevalier 1996 ) , assuming no losses to cosmic ray acceleration .    since each x - ray measurement at time @xmath24",
    "is related to the corresponding distance @xmath29 from the site of the explosion , which has been reached by the wind at a time depending on @xmath22 , or the age of the wind @xmath32 , we can use our measurements as a ` time machine ' to probe the progenitor s history over significant time scales . assuming that @xmath22 and @xmath23 did not change over @xmath33 , or in cases where the shock front deceleration is known from radio data",

    "for a constant wind velocity @xmath22 and constant mass - loss rate @xmath21 , a @xmath34 profile with @xmath35 is expected .",
    "after the expanding shell has become optically thin , it is expected that emission from the sn ejecta itself , heated by the reverse shock , dominates the x - ray output of the interaction regions due to its higher emission measure and higher density . since the plasma temperature of the ejecta is lower than that of the shocked csm , a significant ` softening ' of the x - ray spectrum is expected ( e.g. , chevalier & fransson 1994 ; fransson , lundqvist & chevalier 1996 ) .",

    "since the  hri instrument does not provide energy information , and subsequent  and  observations ( kaaret 2001 ; ray , petre & schlegel 2001 ) lacked enough photon statistics for x - ray spectroscopy , there is no information about the x - ray spectral properties of  and thus the temperatures of the forward and reverse shock .",

    "the claimed onset of the deceleration to @xmath51 coincides with the flattening of the radio lightcurve and might be indicative for the shock running into a dense csm ( marcaide et  al .  2002 ) .",

    ", however , is in conflict with a constant stellar wind velocity and constant mass - loss rate model ( see fig .  [ massloss ] ) .",
    "similarly to , an early  upper limit to the x - ray flux of the sn ic  1994i on day 52 has been reported to be in conflict with the x - ray evolution in terms of a simple power - law , and with a constant mass - loss rate and wind velocity ( immler et  al .",
    "this is indicative that a simple power - law model for the x - ray rate of decline might be incomplete for describing the early epoch in the csm interaction .",
    "assuming an initial exponential rise of the x - ray luminosity after the outburst ( at time @xmath156 ) and a subsequent power - law decline with index @xmath157 , we can parameterize the x - ray evolution as @xmath158 with @xmath159 .",
    "this model has been successfully used to describe the time dependence of the radio emission of sne ( weiler et al .",
    "1986 ) and the x - ray emission of sn  1994i ( immler et  al .",
    "2002 ) . in this representation",
    "the external absorption of the emission is represented by the @xmath160 term ( ` optical depth ' ) and the time - dependence of the optical depth is parameterized by the exponent @xmath161 .",
    "the rise of the x - ray flux could be either due to a decreasing absorption by intervening material along the line - of - sight to the x - ray emitting hot gas or could simply indicate a non - production of soft x - rays at early times .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of high - quality data for  at early times precludes a more detailed investigation . the low inferred mass - loss rate around 0.66  yrs after the outburst of , however , could be due to such an exponential increase in the x - ray emission .",
    "the data can therefore be reconciled with a constant mass - loss rate history if we assume an initial rise of the emission , which is observationally not further constrained .",
    "long - term x - ray lightcurves and high - quality spectra are also available for sne 1993j ( immler et  al .  2001 ;",
    "zimmermann & aschenbach 2003 ) and 1978k ( schlegel et  al .  2004 ) . while the overall x - ray lightcurve of sn  1993j is best described by a @xmath162 rate of decline , significant ` bumps ' around day @xmath53",
    "1,000 are observed , which might be due to a change in the slope of the csm density profile ( zimmermann & aschenbach 2003 ) .",
    "imaging revealed that the expanding shock region has a circular morphology , which is indicative of a smooth csm .",
    "based on the x - ray and radio data , a significant change in the mass - loss rate of the sn  1993j progenitor was discovered , with a continuous decrease from @xmath163 to @xmath164 during the late stages of the evolution ( immler et  al .",
    "2001 ; van dyk et  al .",
    "this evolution has been interpreted as a transition in the progenitor s evolution from the red to the blue supergiant phase during the last @xmath165  yrs of the evolution ( immler et  al .",
    "while a deceleration of the shock could not account for the change in the mass - loss rate history for sn  1993j , correction for a strongly decelerated shock produces a flat mass - loss rate history for  with @xmath3 .",
    "the bumpy csm structure inferred for  based on our analysis might be largely explained by systematic and statistical uncertainties in the x - ray flux , especially when the cross - calibration uncertainties between , , , and  are taken into account ( which would add an additional @xmath166% to the errors quoted in this paper ; see snowden 2002 and the epic calibration documentation ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that  does not show any evidence for a change in the stellar wind parameters .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of  is best described by a two - temperature thermal plasma emission model with @xmath1  kev , @xmath0  kev , accounting for 64% and 36% of the total ( 0.32  kev ) flux , respectively , and no intrinsic absorption .",
    "single - component fits can not be statistically excluded and give a similar temperature ( @xmath93  kev for a thermal plasma fit ; @xmath98  kev for a thermal bremsstrahlung fit ) and flux compared to the soft component of the two - temperature fit .",
    "the hard and soft spectral components are likely due to emission from the forward ( hard component ) and reverse shock ( soft component ) .",
    "while minor contamination of the spectrum with unresolved xrbs within the disk of m100 can not be conclusively excluded , spectral analysis of various point - source free regions within the @xmath167 ellipse of m100 give plasma temperatures significantly different from the spectral components above ( @xmath168 $ ]  kev ) and likely originate in hot plasma within or above the disk of m100 .",
    "similarly to , a best - fit two - temperature thermal plasma model with @xmath169  kev and @xmath170  kev was observed for sn  1993j based on high - quality  spectroscopy eight years after its outburst ( zimmermann & aschenbach 2003 ) . while these temperatures differ from the plasma temperatures found for   ( @xmath1  kev , @xmath0  kev ) the overall temperature evolution for sn  1993j with a softening over time",
    "is consistent with the spectrum of  at this late stage .",
    "since no time - resolved spectroscopy is available for , we used the best - fit spectral template of the  mos data to convert count rates into fluxes , luminosities , and compute mass - loss rates and csm densities .",
    "changes in the spectral properties , however , do not have a significant impact on the main results from this analysis ( see   [ epic ] ) .",

    "a more recent  observation revealed the emergence of a soft ( @xmath174  kev ) component , probably from the reverse shock , in addition to the harder component observed with  ( immler & lewin 2003 ) .    in terms of spectral properties ,",

    "a higher assumed wind velocity would further decrease the csm number densities and give an even closer match to the extrapolated sn  1978k profile . even though clumps in the csm leading to an increase in the csm density can not be conclusively excluded , the seeming ` jump ' in the csm density between log@xmath121 = 17.67 $ ] (  pspc ) and @xmath185 (  acis data ) is likely caused by the large errors associated with the low photon statistics of these observations and cross - calibration uncertainties between the different instruments .",
    "spatially resolved  radio imaging of  at an age of @xmath186  yrs have , in fact , shown a uniform shell - like structure with no evidence for a clumpy csm or a geometry different from spherically symmetric ( bartel & bietenholz 2003 ) .",
    "radio monitoring of  over the past decades has shown significant quasi - periodic or sinusoidal modulations in the radio flux ( see fig .  2 in montes et  al .",

    "the lack of a change in the radio spectral index over the monitored period , however , indicates an unchanged emission mechanism with constant efficiency ( montes et  al .",

    "of particular interest are the late - time optical and uv emission as a result of radiative cooling of the sn shock , ionized by incident x - rays from the csm shock interaction and by the sn event itself ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) .",

    "the  data showed  to be the brightest source at any observed wavelength band ( @xmath189 ) within a small stellar cluster of red supergiants and young blue stars . while  had magnitudes of @xmath190  mag , @xmath191  mag , @xmath192  mag , @xmath193  mag , the next brightest optical / uv sources in the environment had @xmath194  mag and @xmath195  mag .",
    "the  images further suggest the presence of 57 additional , although faint , uv - emitting stars at the site . three more uv sources",
    "were imaged with the  further to the east ( @xmath196 ) , which are located within the om counts extraction aperture ( @xmath139 radius ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that these sources contribute a significant fraction to the observed optical / uv flux within the extracted aperture .",
    "the new ground - based @xmath75-band and h@xmath55 images taken in december 2004 , some 25.6  yrs after the outburst , continue to indicate a strong csm interaction , three years after the  observations .",
    "this suggests that both h@xmath55 and the broad [ o i ] and [ o ii ] line emissions seen in the 1993 spectra are still of comparable strength to levels more than a decade earlier .",

    "the h@xmath55 lightcurve of  shows no decline between 1987 and 1991 ( fesen et  al .",
    "1999 ) , while a slight increase in the 1993 data is observed , which coincides with the observed flattening of the radio lightcurve .",
    "a similar h@xmath55 luminosity was observed for the type ii - l sn  1980k ( @xmath199 ; fesen et  al .",
    "1999 ) at an age of 1415 years after its explosion .",
    "these high late - time h@xmath55 luminosities are largely the result of high electron densities ( @xmath200@xmath201 ) , which are supported by the high inferred csm densities in this paper ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the om @xmath66-band data show a bright source at the position of ( @xmath202 ) , while the   data from 1996 show very weak emission from  in the @xmath66-band .",
    "this difference can be attributed to the cut - off of the  @xmath66-band filter redward to 3,800   , while the @xmath66-band filter of the om cuts off at 3,950   , which then includes the broad [ ne iii ] emission lines at @xmath1443868,3869 .",
    "the detection of [ ne iii ] emission lines from  ( fesen et al .",
    "1999 ) may explain why the sn is brighter in the  om @xmath66-band images than in the  @xmath66-band ( f336w filter ) images .",

    "while the source at the position of  is classified as point - like in all om bands by the source detection routines , slightly more extended emission is visible in the om @xmath65 and @xmath10-band images compared to the @xmath66-band .",
    "this is consistent with at least a substantial fraction of the @xmath9 ( @xmath203 ) and @xmath10-band ( @xmath204 ) fluxes being to the sn itself . for the @xmath10-band ,",
    "most of the flux likely arises from mg ii 2,800     where the peak in the @xmath10-band effective area is located .",
    "a substantial fraction of the @xmath65-band flux might also be due to ( 2030% contribution to the total light in this ob / sn spatial region ) and is due to [ o iii ] 4,363    line emission .",
    "the contribution from the ob stars to the east may be significantly reduced , relative to that from the sn , to the total flux within the @xmath66-band passband for both the  and om filters , due to the balmer jump at 3,600    in the stellar spectra of these stars .",
    "because of the strong appearance of  in the om @xmath66-band image , the [ ne iii ] emission may have substantially increased in strength since the  spectra obtained in 1996 ( fesen et al .  1999 ) .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that the  data were acquired before the increase of  at radio wavelengths . this increase could be caused by either a higher ionization of the csm interaction and/or a lowering of the local reddening / extinction due to dust evaporation via shocks ( i.e. , dust in the csm ) or less ejecta formed dust via dilution from expansion .    in summary ,",
    "the high inferred optical / uv flux for , especially in the @xmath66-band , further suggests continued strong csm interaction even at this late stage in the evolution and large radii from the site of the explosion , which is also supported by our recent mdm @xmath75-band data , and confirms our results which are independently inferred from the x - ray data .",
