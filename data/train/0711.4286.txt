    "the geometry of state space depends on the distance measure chosen . in state discrimination ,",
    "given a set of possible states , our task is to find out as ` best ' as possible which of the states we have in our possession @xcite .",
    "finding an optimal procedure of unambiguous discrimination is particularly interesting if the states analyzed are mixed @xcite .",
    "the usual approach to the quantum discrimination problem is to begin by considering the classical case and then extending to the quantum case .",
    "different concepts of ` best ' induce different measures of distinguishability in the space of classical probability distributions . in the quantum case , on top of the statistical uncertainty of states , even pure states can not be always be perfectly discriminated ( if the states are not orthogonal ) , meaning that one has to be careful in extending these to the quantum setting . to do this we bring it back to the classical setting of probability distributions by maximising over all possible discrimination measurements . in this way",
    "the problem of discriminating quantum states has led to several distance measures associated with the ability to discriminate well ( see e.g.@xcite ) . in this work",
    "we would like to consider the geometry induced by these measures , and how the problem of state discrimination can be expressed geometrically .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath0 denote the set of mixed quantum states acting on an @xmath1 dimensional hilbert space @xmath2 .",
    "it is a convex , compact set of dimensionality @xmath3 .",
    "its geometric structure depends on the metric used .",
    "the following distances are often used @xcite @xmath4^{1/2 } , \\label{hs1 } \\\\",
    "d_{\\rm tr}(\\rho_1,\\rho_2)&:=&\\frac{1}{2}{\\rm tr}|\\rho_1-\\rho_2| , \\label{trace1 } \\\\",
    "d_{\\rm b}(\\rho_1,\\rho_2)&:=&\\bigl ( 2[1- { \\rm tr}|\\sqrt{\\rho_1}\\sqrt{\\rho_2}| ] \\bigr)^{1/2 } , \\label{bures1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] denoting the hilbert - schmidt ( hs ) distance , the trace distance and the bures distance respectively . the latter quantity is a function of _ fidelity _ @xcite , @xmath5 ^ 2 \\   , \\label{fidel1}\\ ] ] and the root fidelity @xmath6 , ( which in some papers is also is called ` fidelity ' ) .",
    "the bures and the trace distance are _ monotone _ , and do not grow under the action of an arbitrary quantum operation ( completely positive , trace preserving map ) , while the hilbert - schmidt ( hs ) distance is not monotone .",
    "these measures can induce different geometries .",
    "for instance , the set @xmath7 of mixed states of a qubit , is equivalent to the standard bloch  ball ( the bloch - sphere and its interior ) for the trace or hs metric , and to uhlmann hemisphere , @xmath8 , for the bures distance @xcite . for higher @xmath1",
    "the geometries induced by the hs and the trace distance also differ .    in the following we consider systems of dimension @xmath1 greater or equal to two .",
    "we begin our discussion of state discrimination by introducing the diameter of a set of quantum states .",
    "the diameter of the set @xmath0 is independent of @xmath1 , but it does depend on the metric used : the _ diameter _ is the maximal distance between any two states , and it reads    @xmath9    for hs , trace and bures distances , respectively .",
    "any two states separated by @xmath10 are supported on orthogonal subspaces .",
    "the reverse implication holds for bures and trace distances , @xmath11 but is not true for the hilbert - schmidt distance for @xmath12 . for instance , the hs distance between two diagonal density matrices @xmath13 and @xmath14 is equal to @xmath15 , although they are supported on orthogonal subspaces . to witness an even more dramatic example consider the hilbert space of even dimension @xmath1 and two diagonal states , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "although they live in orthogonal subspaces , so their bures and trace distances are maximal , their hs distance reads @xmath18 and tends to zero in the limit of large @xmath1 .",
    "this indicates that when analysing problems of distinguishability , one can not therefore rely on the standard euclidean geometry induced by the hilbert - schmidt distance , but rather better use bures or trace distances .",
    "the trace distance and the bures distance are , in several respects , good measures for quantifying the ability to discriminate states . in @xcite englert",
    "introduced the notion of _ distinguishability _ between two quantum states and showed that it is equal to the trace distance between them .",
    "hence two states can be deterministically discriminated if they can be perfectly distinguished , so their distinguishability is equal to unity .",
    "fuchs and van de graaf found a bound between the bures distance and the trace distance based on the following inequality @xcite @xmath19 this implies that if the fidelity between both states is equal to zero ( so the states are distinguishable and their bures distance is maximal ) their trace distance is equal to unity , and is hence maximal .",
    "in fact , the trace distance is a simple function of the probability to successfully discriminate two states in a single shot measurement ( optimised over all allowed quantum measurements ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , the bures distance can be seen as the optimised kullback ",
    "leibler distance between output statistics over all quantum measurements ( again , an optimized cost function for discrimination ) @xcite .    in the special case where both density matrices are diagonal , and",
    "read @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the operators commute .",
    "such a case is often called classical since the distances between quantum states reduce then exactly to their classical analogues : the trace distance @xmath22 is the equal to the @xmath23 distance ( with a normalisation constant @xmath24 ) between both probability vectors ; the bures distance reads @xmath25^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath26 denotes the _ bhattacharyya _ coefficient @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this quantity is equal to the root fidelity between any two diagonal states , @xmath27 , so its square @xmath28 , is sometimes called _ classical fidelity _ between to probability distributions .    in section [ scn : unitary orbits ] we prove general bounds for the fidelity between arbitrary two quantum states @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 where the vectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent the spectra of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , while the arrows up ( down ) indicate that the eigenvalues are put in the nondecreasing ( nonincreasing ) order .",
    "these results imply equivalent bounds for the bures distance @xmath32 analogous bounds for the trace distance proved in the same section read @xmath33 where the symbols @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote here diagonal density matrices with all eigenvalues in the increasing ( decreasing ) order .    in this paper we set out to give a geometric interpretation to the problem of state discrimination in terms of the geometries induced by the trace and bures distance .",
    "we begin in section [ scn : perfect disc ] by giving a set of conditions on states such that they may be perfectly discriminated . in section [ scn : geometrical consequences ] we present some geometrical consequences of these conditions and phrase the problem of state discrimination in terms of the embedding of simplices with respect to different distance functions . in section [ scn : unitary orbits ] we investigate the distance between states under unitary orbits and its geometric interpretation , and prove the above bounds .",
    "we finish in section [ scn : conclusions ] with conclusions .",
    "we begin by looking at some conditions on the set of states that can be perfectly discriminated",
    ". our condition will follow from simple analysis of the measurements ( in terms of the associated positive operator valued measure ( povm ) ) , and give general conditions which , in the next section , will be used to give some geometrical consequences of the problem .    two states @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be deterministically discriminated iff their supports do not overlap .    * proof*. any perfect state discrimination strategy for two states @xmath36 can be written as a three element povm @xmath37 , where the outcomes correspond to concluding it is the state @xmath29 , @xmath30 and allowing for inconclusive outcome respectively .    note",
    "that although in general we can have far more possible outcomes than three , this formalism does include all possible discrimination strategies - this is because we can always group the outcomes corresponding to state @xmath29 to give @xmath38 , and those to state @xmath30 to give @xmath39 , and the remaining elements we group to give @xmath40 .",
    "the probability of success of the strategy can always be written in terms of such povms , thus we can restrict ourselves to only these three element povms for perfect discrimination .",
    "the conditions on the povm for deterministic state discrimination are    @xmath41    ( this is the same logic as in @xcite , only without the separability condition ) .",
    "the first two are necessary for perfect state discrimination , and the last two are just the conditions for @xmath42 to be a povm .    conditions ( [ eqn : condition perfect1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : condition perfect2 ] ) imply that the elements @xmath38 and @xmath39 include projections onto the support of @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively . to see this , rewrite ( [ eqn : condition perfect1 ] ) in the eigenbasis of @xmath43",
    "( we extend this basis to the full space for writing @xmath38 in ( [ eqn : m1 ] ) ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a probability , hence @xmath46 and equality is obtained only when @xmath47 for all @xmath48 such that @xmath49 . if we also demand conditions ( [ eqn : condition completeness]),([eqn : condition positivity ] ) the most general @xmath50 can be written @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the projector onto the support of state @xmath53",
    ". the support of a state @xmath54 , with eigen - decomposition @xmath55 . from here , condition ( [ eqn : condition completeness ] ) clearly says @xmath56 hence the supports have zero overlap .",
    "@xmath57    the theorem is easily extended to sets of states @xmath58 .",
    "the states @xmath58 can be deterministically discriminated iff their supports do not overlap .",
    "this directly leads to    consider @xmath59 states acting on the @xmath1 dimensional hilbert space , which can be discriminated deterministically .",
    "then @xmath60    this proposition is clear from the theorem , but also can be derived from the result in @xcite .",
    "this is done by taking the zero entanglement case of the main result presented there .",
    "specifically , the left hand inequality in equation ( 8) for zero entanglement , along with equation ( 1 ) in @xcite give exactly ( [ rankmax ] ) .",
    "we now look at what the above results have to say in terms of the geometric interpretation of the problem of state discrimination . due to property ( [ maxb ] ) the above theorem",
    "can also be formulated as the condition that the trace ( or bures ) distance between states are maximal .",
    "this fact has an immediate geometric implication .",
    "let us start to work with the trace distance and denote by @xmath61 a maximal regular @xmath62 defined by @xmath63 points with mutual trace distance between points equal to @xmath64 .",
    "[ prop:3 ] let @xmath65 be an arbitrary convex subset of @xmath0 .",
    "assume that there exists a simplex @xmath66 and assume that @xmath65 does not contain @xmath67 .",
    "then the maximal number of states of @xmath65 which can be discriminated deterministically is equal to @xmath63 .",
    "an analogous of the proposition [ prop:3 ] may be formulated for the geometry induced by the bures distance .",
    "[ htbp ]     with a ) @xmath68 and b ) @xmath69 distinguishable states which form a  maximal simplex of size @xmath70 with side length @xmath71 , with respect to the bures ( or the trace ) metric.,width=415 ]    thus the problem of finding the maximal number of distinguishable states on a certain set is equivalent to the problem of embedding inside it a regular simplex of maximal dimensionality with the diameter given by @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    at this point",
    "it is worth mentioning a different quantum problem of finding ` symmetric , informationally complete positive operational valued measures ' ( sic povm ) @xcite .",
    "this has a similar geometric interpretation of inscribing inside the set @xmath0 of mixed states an @xmath3 dimensional simplex spanned by @xmath72 pure states @xmath73 , the overlap of which is constant , @xmath74 for any @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , in this case , the side of the simplex with respect to the bures distance reads @xmath76 , and for a finite dimension @xmath1 , this is smaller than @xmath77 .",
    "so in the distinguishability problem we wish to embed into the set @xmath0 of mixed states a simplex of the maximal side length @xmath78 with dimensionality not larger than @xmath1 , while in the sic povm problem we try to inscribe inside the same set a higher dimensional simplex of a smaller side length @xmath79 .",
    "in this section we shall be concerned with the distances between orbits generated from quantum states by unitaries .",
    "that is , given two states @xmath29 and @xmath30 with fixed spectra , we wish to know how `` far '' or how `` close '' we can make these states by unitary action .",
    "we will find that for the bures and trace distance , the closest and the farthest that can be achieved is given when both states are diagonal in the same basis .",
    "this has a geometric interpretation in terms of the weyl chambers as will be discussed .",
    "this problem can be interesting in many areas of quantum information .",
    "operationally the problem of finding the best unitary separation of two density matrices may be interesting if we are restricted to certain spectra or mixedness .",
    "for example in coding for noisy channels . if we know that the output of some channel will imply a certain mixedness ( or even specific spectra ) , we naturally want to choose to encode on states that are least affected by this .",
    "if we are encoding classical information , this would be those states which remain most distinguishable afterwards .",
    "a simple example of such a channel would be one which probabilistically adds white noise .",
    "freedom of the input state would correspond to unitary freedom of the outputs states which we wish to optimise over , hence considering the optimum over unitary orbits of the output mixed states is equal to finding the optimum encoding .",
    "we will see that in such cases , when only the spectra are restricted , the worst and best cases are given by taking them diagonal in the same basis .",
    "consider first two classical , @xmath1point , normalised probability distributions , @xmath80 and @xmath81 such that @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "as earlier , let @xmath84 denote the vector ordered decreasingly , @xmath85 , while let @xmath86 represent components of the probability vector in the increasing order : @xmath87 .",
    "any quantum state @xmath29 generates an orbit of unitarily equivalent states , @xmath88 .",
    "two states @xmath29 and @xmath88 are sometimes called _ geometrically uniform _ and they have been recently considered in the context of unambiguous discrimination @xcite .    we are going to discuss another problem of distinguishing states from two orbits . consider two diagonal quantum states , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , from which we two orbits of unitarily equivalent states .",
    "we shall analyze the minimal and maximal distance @xmath91 between the orbits , @xmath92 since performing maximization over two unitary matrices @xmath93 and @xmath94 is equivalent to find a single unitary matrix @xmath95 .",
    "here @xmath91 stands for one of the monotone distances @xmath96 or @xmath97 . a similar statement for the non monotone hilbert - schmidt distance ( [ hs1 ] )",
    "was already proved in @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that extrema for these distances are obtained for diagonal matrices .",
    "then the extremization has to be performed only over the group @xmath98 of permutation matrices , which change the order of the spectra , @xmath99 the minimum is then achieved for the same order of components in both vectors , while the maximum occurs for opposite ordering so using the above formula one can evaluated analytically the extremal distances for both distances in consideration .",
    "let us first show that this conjecture holds for the bures distance .",

    "we have shown that the problem of finding the maximal number of perfectly distinguishable states in a certain set @xmath65 containing quantum states is equivalent to finding the dimension of the largest simplex of a fixed side size which can be embedded inside the set @xmath65 . for this purpose one can not use euclidean simplices defined by the hs distance , but use simplices with respect to bures or trace distances .",

    "<S> we analyse the problem of finding sets of quantum states that can be deterministically discriminated . from a geometric point of view </S>",
    "<S> this problem is equivalent to that of embedding a simplex of points whose distances are maximal with respect to the bures distance ( or trace distance ) . </S>",
    "<S> we derive upper and lower bounds for the trace distance and for the fidelity between two quantum states , which imply bounds for the bures distance between the unitary orbits of both states . </S>",
    "<S> we thus show that when analysing minimal and maximal distances between states of fixed spectra it is sufficient to consider diagonal states only . hence considering optimal discrimination , given freedom up to unitary orbits , it is sufficient to consider diagonal states </S>",
    "<S> . this is illustrated geometrically in terms of weyl chambers . </S>"
