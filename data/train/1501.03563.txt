    "as an important source of power , heat engines are crucial to our human activities .",
    "it is necessary to investigate their energetics in our times of resource shortage .",
    "the classical equilibrium thermodynamics provides a powerful tool to investigate the ideal heat engines consisting of reversible processes .",
    "the concept of can not efficiency is one of the cornerstones of thermodynamics .",
    "it serves as the upper bound for efficiencies of heat engines working between two heat reservoirs .",
    "can not efficiency is achieved only for heat engines operating in equilibrium or quasi - static states , which operate infinitely slow and yield vanishing power output .",
    "the practical heat engines usually complete thermodynamic cycles in finite periods or operating at finite net rates , which give rise to the development of finite - time thermodynamics .",
    "the most elegant result on this topic is the efficiency at maximum power for the curzon - alhborn endoreversible heat engine  @xcite , which reads @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 being the temperatures of the hot reservoir and the cold one , respectively .",
    "this result has attracted much attention from physicists and engineers  @xcite .",
    "the previous researches reveal that the curzon - alhborn efficiency ( @xmath3 ) is also recovered , or at least approximately recovered , in a lot of heat engines such as the stochastic heat engine @xcite , the feynman ratchet @xcite , the single - level quantum dot engine @xcite , and the symmetric low - dissipation heat engine @xcite .",
    "the connection between finite - time thermodynamics and linear irreversible thermodynamics was proposed by van den broeck  @xcite .",
    "the constitutive relation , which is defined as the relation between the generalized thermodynamic fluxes and forces , is one of the central formulas in irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "the constitutive relation is assumed to be linear and restricted by the onsager reciprocal relation @xcite in linear irreversible thermodynamics . using the linear constitutive relation ,",
    "van den broeck found that the efficiency at maximum power for tight - coupling heat engines is half of the carnot efficiency .",
    "however , we observed that many heat engines , such as the curzon - alhborn endoreversible heat engine  @xcite , the feynman ratchet as a heat engine  @xcite and the single - level quantum dot heat engine  @xcite , can not be precisely described by the constitutive relation for linear response .",
    "there exist higher order terms in the relations between generalized thermodynamic fluxes and forces for these heat engines .",
    "this conflict might lead to inappropriate results when we try to investigate the energetics of heat engines in a higher precision such as the universal efficiency at maximum power up to the quadratic order  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is an urgent task for us to seek a generic expression of nonlinear constitutive relations for heat engines .",
    "on the other hand , based on our early researches we noticed that typical heat engines exhibit a kind of homotypy , which had not been touched in previous literature .",
    "we observed that the heat exchanges between a cyclic heat engine and its two reservoirs abide by the same function type ; and that the forward and backward flows for an autonomous heat engine also conform to the same function type .",
    "this homotypy mathematically reflects in the existence of hidden symmetries : the heat exchanges between the cyclic heat engine and its two reservoirs are dual under the joint transformation of parity inversion and time - reversal operation [ see @xmath4-symmetry ( [ eq - homo - cyclicpt ] ) in sec .",
    "[ sec - homocyclic - pt ] ] ; the forward and backward flows in the autonomous heat engine are also dual under the parity inversion [ see @xmath5-symmetry ( [ eq - homo - autop ] ) in sec .",
    "[ sec - homoauto - p ] ] .",
    "it is still unclear what constraints will these hidden symmetries impose on the expressions of nonlinear constitutive relations for heat engines .    in this work ,",
    "we first revisit the generic model for tight - coupling heat engines proposed in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "then we will investigate the hidden symmetries in heat engines , based on which we derive the nonlinear constitutive relations up to the quadratic order for cyclic heat engines and autonomous heat engines , respectively .",
    "these results are also confirmed by typical models of heat engines .",
    "in a conventional setup of heat engine , the engine absorbs heat @xmath6 from a hot reservoir at temperature @xmath1 and releases heat @xmath7 into a cold reservoir at temperature @xmath2 per unit time .",
    "simultaneously , it outputs power @xmath8 against an external load , which may be further expressed as @xmath9 according to the energy conservation .    for the engine operating in a finite period or at finite rate rather than in a quasi - static state , the contribution of the interactions between the engine and the reservoirs should not be ignored @xcite .",
    "we introduce two nonnegative weighted parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12 to represent the degree of asymmetry of the interactions between the engine and the reservoirs . with these parameters ,",
    "the weighted thermal flux @xmath13 and the weighted reciprocal of temperature @xmath14 may be defined as @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 depend on specific models .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 indicates a special situation in which the engine is symmetrically interacts with the two reservoirs .    from ( [ eq - model - conservation ] ) and ( [ eq - model - jt ] ) , we obtain the heat fluxes @xmath18 based on these relations , we obtain a refined generic model as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in this new physical picture , the engine absorbs heat @xmath6 from the hot reservoir per unit time while an amount of heat @xmath19 is converted into work due to the interaction between the engine and the hot reservoir .",
    "a thermal flux @xmath13 flows through the engine . then the engine releases heat @xmath7 into the cold reservoir per unit time while an amount of heat @xmath20 is converted into work due to the interaction between the engine and the cold reservoir . the influence of the relative strength of the interactions between the engine and the reservoirs is explicitly included in this picture .    refined generic model of a tight - coupling heat engine ( reproduced",

    "it should be noticed that the sign of @xmath25 is of physical meaning .",
    "@xmath25 takes a positive sign when the thermodynamic cycle operates as a heat engine , while it takes a negative sign when the thermodynamics cycle operates as an refrigerator .",
