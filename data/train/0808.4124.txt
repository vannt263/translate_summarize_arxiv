    "dependent pdfs for the gluon have rather large uncertainties due to the fact that the exchanged virtual photon does not couple directly , i.e. , at leading order , to the gluon .",
    "thus additional data from polarized pp scattering , in which longitudinally polarized gluons are directly probed via scattering off longitudinally polarized gluons or quarks , should greatly reduce the uncertainties in the gluon distribution .",
    "this has recently been demonstrated in a global nlo fit @xcite using , for the first time , the available inclusive and semi - inclusive dis data together with first results from polarized pp scattering at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",

    "so far only the maximum gluon scenario can be excluded , however , the advantage of the charged pion data is in its increased sensitivity to the sign of @xmath44 .",
