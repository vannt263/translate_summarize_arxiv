    "despite the significant progress already achieved both in observational and theoretical investigations as well as in numerical modelling of solar flares , the main physical processes involved in energy conversion , transfer , deposition and losses in solar flares are only understand fragmentarily . however , broad insight is crucial for solving the most important questions , like a balance of energy in the solar flares , a prediction of solar flare magnitudes and their emission spectra , and emission of high energy particles .",
    "it is commonly accepted that during the impulsive phase of solar flares as well as to some extent , before and after the impulsive phase , beams of non - thermal electrons , accelerated somewhere in the solar corona stream along magnetic field lines toward the chromosphere , where they heat by collision the dense matter near the feet of the loops .",
    "the interactions of the non - thermal electrons with dense matter also cause a strong and variable in time emission of hard x - rays ( hxr ) called electron - ion bremsstrahlung which was described by @xcite and @xcite . the chromospheric matter",
    ", heated up to coronal temperatures , expands and fills the magnetic ropes ( such a process is called chromospheric evaporation ) and it mainly emits soft x - rays ( sxr ) and also some thermal hard x - rays @xcite . taking into account that the main physical processes occurring in solar flares are very complicated and cross - related and very difficult in comprehensive analytical description , a numerical modelling of the flares based on their observational properties allows us to extend our understanding of the physical aspects of the flares .",
    "the first numerical models explored the hydrodynamic response of the solar atmosphere to heating by electron beams @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived the method of estimation of the sizes of spatially unresolved solar and stellar coronal flaring structures based on the x - ray light curves and time - resolved temperature and emission measure values measured during flare decay , applying hydrodynamic modelling .",
    "more sophisticated multi - thread , time - dependent hydrodynamic simulations of solar flares was applied by @xcite to observations of the masuda s flare of january @xmath2 , 1992 . combined modelling of acceleration ,",
    "transport , and hydrodynamic response in solar flares was described in the paper by @xcite .",
    "they tested three models of solar flare heating , repeating the same simulation with two kinds of injection downward - beamed electrons using different methods of particle transport and the new heating rates .",
    "as a main result of this comparison , the model calculated using analytical approximation of particle transport gives about 10% difference compared to the model calculated with the fokker - planck formalism but provides an acceptable approximation .",
    "in addition , it was found that using the model with the fokker - planck description of the particle transport and if the injected electron spectrum is based on stochastic acceleration , the authors found higher coronal temperatures and densities , larger upflow velocities , and faster increases of these quantities than in the model with electron injection of power law .",
    "@xcite using hydrodynamic modelling examined the sensitivity of the _ goes _ classification to the non - thermal electron beam properties using _ yohkoh _ data , while a similar analysis was performed for the _ rhessi _ data by @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we used all achievements of our previous investigations of the energy transfer and deposition processes in simple , single - loop solar flares , in particular our investigations of interactions of the non - thermal electrons with matter @xcite and numerical modelling of the x - ray flare emission @xcite .",
    "additionally , in our work we took into account the results presented by @xcite , which validated certain simplifications during the modelling of solar flares , and were helpful in the interpretation of the results .",
    "we applied an essentially modified by us hydrodynamic numerical code of the naval research laboratory ( nrl ) , see @xcite and @xcite where a detailed description of the modified code is given .",
    "we modelled a heating process of the flaring plasma using fisher s approximation @xcite on the basis of energy flux parameters evaluated using observed hxr spectra . in the present paper",
    "we apply the fokker - planck formalism of the electron precipitation process through the plasma in the loops following method already evaluated by @xcite . we computed the distributions of the non - thermal electrons in a flaring loop , spatial distributions of the x - ray non - thermal emissions and integral fluxes for the selected energy ranges which were compared with the observed fluxes in relevant energy ranges .",
    "additionally , we also conducted a comparative analysis of the spatial distribution of the signal in the _ rhessi _ images for the footpoints and entire flare loops in selected energy ranges , and compared these quantities with the fluxes obtained from the models .",
    "a conformity of fluxes was applied as a measure of the quality of the calculated flare models and applicability of used procedures and simplifications .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of the numerical modelling of two solar single - loop like flares .",
    "section 2 describes the analysed events .",
    "section 3 shows the details of the hxr spectra fitting procedure , numerical modelling algorithm and methods of calculation of thermal and non - thermal emissions .",
    "section 4 presents the obtained results .",
    "the conclusions are discussed in section 5 .",
    "for analysis we selected solar flares which look like single - loop structures in x - rays , best for applied numerical model .",
    "the found flares were observed on february @xmath0 , 2002 , and june @xmath1 , 2002 .",
    "both events were presented and analysed in several papers .",
    "the emissions of the flares were registered by the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( _ rhessi _ ) satellite @xcite .",
    "rhessi _ was designed to image solar flares in photons having energies from soft x - rays ( 3 kev ) to gamma rays ( 17 mev ) with a high temporal and energy resolution and also to provide high resolution spectroscopy in the same energy range .",
    "rhessi _ has nine coaxial germanium detectors with high signal sensitivity and allows a restoration of the images and spectra which are very useful for investigation of the non - thermal emission of solar flares . in case of excessively high photon fluxes ,",
    "_ rhessi _ automatically limits the readings using attenuators , unfortunately inserting also troublesome discontinuities of the recorded data @xcite .",
    "however , the both investigated flares were observed with the a1 attenuator permanently on .",
    "_ goes _ x - ray data were also used .",
    "the _ goes _ ( geostationary operational environmental satellites ) satellites since 1974 have continuously recorded integrated solar x - ray fluxes in two energy bands 1 - 8    and 0.5 - 4   with 3 s temporal resolution @xcite . to confirm the likely single loop structure of the analysed flares , additional observations from the extreme - ultraviolet imaging telescope ( _ eit _ ) were also used .",
    "_ eit _ was installed on board the solar and heliospheric observatory ( _ soho _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and provides full - disk images taken in four bands : 171  , 195  , 284  , and 304   with 5 arcsec spatial resolution .",
    "this event was discussed already by @xcite studying the height at which the hxr emission originates , by @xcite modelling the hxr emission , and by @xcite who investigated the relationship between the brightnesses of the footpoints .",
    "@xcite studied physics of the neupert effect and @xcite presented a new method to study in detail the temporal evolution of thermal and non - thermal photon fluxes applied to this flare .",
    "the c7.5 _ goes _ class flare occurred in active region noaa 9825 on february @xmath0 , 2002 which was located near the western limb of the solar disk . in this region on that day , before the start of the analysed flare four events occurred , m4.2 ( 02:44 ) , m5.1 ( 05:52 ) , c2.5 ( 07:41 ) , m4.3 ( 09:46 ) and afterwards two c - class c4.5 ( 11:29 ) and c2.9 ( 15:59 ) .",
    "seven flares were observed in the active region on that day .",
    "the sxr ( 1 - 8  ) emission of the analysed flare recorded by _ goes _ started at 11:02 ut , reached its maximum at 11:07 ut , and was observed up to 11:29 ut .",

    "hard x - ray images were used to determine the main geometrical parameters of the flaring loop using a method proposed by @xcite .",
    "the cross - section of the loop @xmath3 was estimated as an average area of both footpoints delimited with isophotes of 30% of the maximum flux in the 35 - 45 kev energy range .",
    "the cross - section of flaring loops of both analysed events was assumed to be constant .",

    "@xcite analysed this flare in their study of physics of the neupert effect . in papers by @xcite the authors discussed the morphology and evolution of the flare , particularly in the euv and h@xmath5 energy range .",
    "they showed evidence for multiple - loop interactions as the cause of the flare .",
    "also @xcite examined various scenarios of the flare and proposed a three - dimensional scheme in which the filament eruption and flare were caused by interaction of the magnetic ropes .",
    "the investigated flare occurred in active region ( ar ) noaa 9973 ( s17e23 ) on june @xmath1 , 2002 .",
    "it was classified as a c9.4 _ goes _ class flare .",
    "a magnetic class of the active region was beta - gamma and it produced three c class flares on that day , including the analysed event .",

    "the impulsive phase started in x - rays above 25 kev at 11:44:14 ut , had double maximum at 11:44:34 and 11:44:54 ut , and was observed up to 11:46:02 ut .",
    "the hard x - ray emission of the impulsive phase was observed up to 300 kev .",
    "the x - ray emission below 25 kev started to rise simultaneously with the _ goes _ emission .",
    "small increases of emissions causing flattening of the sxr maxima occurred at the same time in the _ goes _ emission and _ rhessi _ channels 4 - 12 kev and 12 - 25 kev at 11:47:42 ut .",
    "the start of the impulsive phase occurred simultaneously with an increase of the soft x - rays emissions and no preheating prior to the impulsive phase was observed .",
    "the images of the flare were obtained using _ rhessi _ data collected with sub - collimators 3f , 4f , 5f , 6f , 8f and 9f integrated over 48 s periods and the pixon imaging algorithm with 1 arcsec pixel size . the image restored in the 30 - 80 kev energy range revealed two distinct footpoints , where the western footpoint is brighter than the eastern ( figure 5 left panel ) . in the 6 - 12 kev energy range",
    "the entire flare loop was seen . the image recorded by _",
    "soho / eit _ 195   at 11:50:54 ut , after the impulsive phase of the flare and overplotted with the _ rhessi _ 30 - 80 kev pixon image ( contour ) registered at 11:44:20 ut is shown in figure 5 right panel .",
    "the main flare loop visible in the euv range spatially coincides well with footpoints visible in the _ rhessi _ 30 - 80 kev range .",
    "a method of determination of the geometrical parameters was the same as for the first flare .",
    "the cross section of the loop @xmath6 was estimated as an average area of the feet delimited with isophote of 30% of the maximum flux in the 30 - 80 kev energy range .",
    "half - length of the loop was estimated as @xmath7 cm .",
    "samples of _ rhessi _ spectra taken before , during and after the impulsive phase are shown in figure 6 .",
    "the procedure of the numerical modelling used in this paper is very similar to the one described in previous publications @xcite .",
    "the main assumption of the method is that interactions of the non - thermal electrons ( ntes ) with plasma are the only source of plasma heating during all phases of the analysed events .",
    "the same hydrodynamic model of the analysed flares was used , where the non - thermal electron beams derived from _ rhessi _ spectra as the carriers of heating energy deposited , via coulomb collisions .",
    "the energy deposition rates were calculated using an approximation given by @xcite . as in the previous paper @xcite the low energy cut - off of the electron distribution @xmath8",
    "was automatically optimised by comparison at each time step of the observed sxr",
    "_ goes _ flux in the 1 - 8   range and the calculated one . in this paper in addition , for each time step the steady - state electron spatial and spectral distributions in the loop were calculated using a fokker - planck code @xcite . known distributions of the non - thermal electrons and physical parameters of the plasma along the flaring loop allowed for the calculation of spatial distributions of the x - ray thermal and non - thermal emissions , to derive integral fluxes in the selected energy ranges and to compare them with the fluxes observed in the same energy ranges ( see a detailed description below ) .",
    "furthermore , a comparative analysis of the spatial distributions of the signals in the rhessi images and models of both flares was made .",
    "we compared signals emitted from selected structures and within selected energy ranges .",
    "the conformity level was applied as a measure of the model quality and validity of the applied procedures and simplifications .",
    "the _ rhessi _ data were analysed using the _ rhessi _ ospex package of the solarsoftware ( ssw ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra of both flares were measured with a 4 seconds time resolution in 158 energy bands ranging from 6 to 300 kev .",
    "the analysed spectra were corrected for pulse pileup , decimation , and albedo effect ( compton back - scattering on the photosphere , @xcite ) using the _ rhessi _ standard analysis tools .",
    "the accuracy of background subtraction is a key point in spectra analysis . in the case of the _ rhessi _ spectra background is usually modelled as a linear ( or higher - order polynomial ) interpolation between averaged fluxes before and after the flare .",
    "however , for many flares and periods between them gradual rises and falls of this background were observed .",
    "such a slow increase and then decrease of the flux were recorded for the february @xmath9 , 2002 flare before 11:04 ut .",
    "similar background variations were observed in all energies , also in the highest energy channel where no flare emission was observed . averaged time profiles of the high energy backgrounds",
    "were used for the modelling of the background variation in the low energy channel during this flare .",
    "this method allows for a subtraction of the backgrounds with sufficient accuracy in different energy channels . for the june @xmath1 , 2002 event the background varied marginally with time during this flare and",
    "was subtracted from data using a linear fit of the background fluxes recorded before and after the flare .",
    "the _ rhessi _ a1 attenuator was permanently used during both analysed events .",
    "thus , counts registered in the 3 - 6 kev energy range are almost exclusively generated by higher energy photons above 11 kev , which is caused by the k - escape effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , only counts above 6 kev were analysed . for the february @xmath9 , 2002 event above 90 kev and for the june @xmath1 , 2002 above 100 kev the x - ray background flux dominates over flare emission ,",
    "so fluxes above these energy levels were also not included for spectral fitting .    particularly at the beginning and end of the flare",
    "when recorded fluxes are low , the count rates in some energy bins can be negative as a result of background subtraction and low signal to noise ratios . in order to keep the count rates positive ( particularly in the 6 - 20 kev energy range ) an increased accumulation time",
    "was applied , causing a worse time resolutions for the beginnings and ends of both analysed events than maxima phases .",
    "the spectra were fitted assuming single temperature thermal plus thick - target models .",
    "the thermal model was defined by a single temperature and an emission measure of the optically thin thermal plasma , based on the x - ray continuum and line emissions calculated using the chianti atomic code @xcite .",
    "the thick - target model was defined by the total integrated non - thermal electrons flux @xmath10 , the power - law index of the electron energy distribution @xmath11 , and low energy cut - off of the electron distribution @xmath8 .",
    "these parameters were then used as characteristics of the injected electrons in the model .",
    "figures 3 and 6 show examples of spectra and fits the thermal and non - thermal component for analysed events and determined on the basis of parameters of the thick - target model .",
    "rhessi _ spectra were fitted using a forward and backward automatic fitting procedure , starting from a time when the non - thermal component was strong enough and clearly visible .",
    "the obtained values of the fitted parameters were controlled and corrected if necessary .",
    "generally , all fitted parameters evolved in a quasi - continuous manner .",
    "geometrical and physical models of the pre - flare loops were built using geometrical parameters - semi - length @xmath12 and cross - section s and also thermodynamic parameters like initial pressure at the base of transition region @xmath13 , temperature , emission measure , mean electron density and _ goes _ flux in the energy range 1 - 8    were estimated from _",
    "rhessi _ and _ goes _ data . in order to obtain for initial pre - flare models",
    "the best conformity between theoretical and observed _ goes _ light curves , the semi - lengths and cross - sections of the loops were refined in a range of @xmath141 pixel .",

    "rhessi _ spectra were used .",
    "the time step of the ntes beam was defined as the accumulation time needed to obtain the spectrum from _ rhessi _ data with a sufficient s / n ratio .",
    "for this reason , during each ntes beam s time step a heating of the loop was calculated with fixed nte beam parameters , while the thermodynamic parameters of the flaring plasma varied , being calculated with a much shorter time step of the hd model .",
    "the best beam time resolution was obtained when the flux was the highest around the maximum of event ( being equal to 4 seconds ) , and the worst for the beginning and the end ( a dozen or several dozen seconds ) . at the end of each nte s",
    "beam time step _ goes _ fluxes were calculated and compared with the observed _ goes _ fluxes .",
    "if a conformity of the fluxes was achieved , the procedure was applied for the next time step .",
    "otherwise , the @xmath8 value was carefully adjusted in order to achieve conformity of the observed and modelled _ goes _ fluxes in the 1 - 8 energy band .",
    "a variation in the @xmath8 value of just a few kev can add or remove a substantial amount of energy to or from the flare loop because of the power - law nature of the energy distribution .",
    "thus @xmath8 must be selected with high precision .",
    "usually the value of @xmath8 obtained from fitting _ rhessi _ spectra is fraught with a large error .",
    "however the applied method limits the range of @xmath8 using an independent energetic condition , like the observed 1 - 8    _ goes _ flux .",
    "the thermal emission fluxes were calculated using the chianti atomic code @xcite for the temperature range 1 - 50 mk , ionization equilibrium by @xcite and solar coronal extended abundances .",
    "thermal emission was calculated for both the lines and continuum . the procedure for calculating the thermal emission fluxes consisted of several stages . in the first",
    ", thermal emission was calculated for each cell of the model and in four energy ranges : 6 - 12 kev , 12 - 25 kev , 25 - 50 kev and 50 - 100 kev at the end of each nte s beam time step .",
    "next , the total flux was calculated for the entire loop in the same energy ranges . as a result",
    "the light curves in different energy ranges and spatial distribution of the thermal emission were obtained .      in this work , the focker - planck formalism was applied using a code originally developed by @xcite , based upon a program developed by walt , macdonald , and francis ( described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , extended to ultrarelativistic energies by @xcite and prepared for public distribution by holman ( _ http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/hessi/ + flarecode / efluxprog.zip _ ) .",
    "this code computes the steady - state electron distribution function in the flare s magnetic loop as a function of a position along a magnetic field line , electron pitch angle , and electron energy .",
    "input data consist of injected flux , distribution of non - thermal electrons at the top of the loop , a model of a distribution of plasma in the flare s loop and a model of the magnetic field .",
    "the solution includes effects due to coulomb collisions with the ambient plasma , effects due to synchrotron emission by the electrons , and effects of bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "it should be noted that most of the non - thermal electrons lose their energy in coulomb collisions while a small fraction ( @xmath20 ) of the electrons energy is converted into hxr by the bremsstrahlung process .",
    "in addition , a synchrotron effect is insignificant in solar flares .",
    "an assumption of a steady - state imposes that the injected flux of ntes is constant in time for all time scales smaller than the transport time scales . in other words , the time of flight of the ntes from top of the loop to bottoms ( feet ) must be shorter than the interval , when parameters of the injected ntes beam at the top of the loop varied .",
    "the code has been modified to work with hydrodynamic code in order to retrieve physical parameters of each cell along a computational loop . as a result",
    "the procedure calculates the electron flux distribution @xmath21 as a function of energy e , at all points in the loop ( distance from the top of loop s ) and for all angles ( pitch angles @xmath22=cosine @xmath23 ) in electrons/@xmath24 . for both analysed flares ,",
    "constant cross - section of loops was assumed ( for what seems to be a good approximation , see * ? ? ? * ) which implies no magnetic mirroring because magnetic field strength was constant and equal to 200 gauss .",
    "the value has been selected on the basis of estimates of the coronal magnetic field presented in @xcite and @xcite .      known distribution of ntes along the loop allows for the calculation of the thin - target non - thermal bremsstrahlung radiation intensity @xmath25 at the end of each time step .",

    "electron flux distribution @xmath30 was integrated over the pitch angle from 1 to -1 .",

    "the light curves and spatial distribution in different energy ranges of the non - thermal hxr emission is obtained",
    ".      observed hard x - ray light curves in ph/@xmath32/sec / kev were restored on several assumptions : the _ rhessi _ attenuator state during the analysed flares was permanently a1 , the resulting fluxes were obtained by dividing the instrument response matrix with diagonal coefficients only , thus other factors were not taken into account e.g. there are no corrections for effects such as k - escape and compton scattering ( described by the off - diagonal elements of the detector response matrix ) . both analysed flares were in the upper range of _ goes _ class c ( c7.5 and c9.4 ) , which does not emit high hard x - ray fluxes .",
    "the correction of decimation and pileup was also included .",
    "observed light curves were prepared in four energy bands : 6 - 12 kev , 12 - 25 kev , 25 - 50 kev and 50 - 100 kev . to make a comparison of modelled and observed fluxes possible , it was necessary to add to each of them the hxr thermal and non - thermal synthesized component and then add a background set of observational light curves . in this way it was possible to compare the synthesized and observed fluxes in the same energy range selected .",
    "figure 7 shows a schematic flow diagram used for the modelling of solar flares and their analysis .",
    "all of the components in the diagram are described in this section .",
    "the main results of modelling the analysed flares are presented in figures 8 and 9 for june @xmath33 , 2002 and figures 10 and 11 for feb @xmath0 , 2002 .",
    "the synthesized _ goes _ 1 - 8    light curves of the flaring loops follow closely those observed for the analysed flares , which is a direct result from our assumptions .",
    "the real test for the accuracy of the model is to compare the observed and calculated fluxes in the 0.5 - 4    band .",
    "the quality of the fit between an observed and synthesized light curve in the 0.5 - 4    band would be a good measure of quality of the calculated flare model .",
    "in other words , with smaller differences between light curves in the 0.5 - 4    band , one gets a better model / simulation , larger differences , and a worse model / simulation . for the event of june @xmath1 , 2002 one can trace this effect in figure 8",
    "( upper left panel ) .",
    "the calculated light curves for the analysed event did not differ too much from the observed ones .",
    "it seems that our model simulates the main physical processes in the right way despite the large simplifications which are used . at the beginning of the flare the synthesized light curve ( red colour )",
    "is under observed ( blue dashed line ) , after 11:44:20 ut have a similar pattern to the maximum at 11:45:40 ut . after this time , during the flat maximum the synthesized curve is located again under the observed one to 11:48:20 ut .",
    "again , after this time the curves are in a similar course to the end of the simulation .",
    "additionally , one can see that during the decay phase ( after 11:48:20 ut ) some heating is necessary .",
    "the green dotted curve in figure 8 ( upper left panel ) represents the evolution of the plasma in the flaring loop without any heating and has a different course to the observed one .",
    "the observation corresponds well to the evolution of plasma flares in the loop which is heated in this time .",
    "a difference in the course between synthesized and observed light curves also reflects on the calculated temperature and emission measure values .",
    "we can follow the behaviour temperature with time in figure 8 ( upper right panel ) . obviously , where there are the greatest differences in the flux 0.5 - 4    energy band , there will also be the largest differences between the temperatures determined from observations and synthesized curves . from almost the beginning of the flare ,",
    "the temperature is lower than that determined at the same time from observations but both values agree within the range of errors .",
    "the situation changes after 11:44:20 ut when the temperature calculated from the model is higher than that calculated from observations and is outside the range of errors .",
    "about 11:45 ut there is a short episode when the temperatures determined from the model and observations are almost identical .",
    "after 11:45:20 ut the highest difference between the temperatures calculated from observations and from the model is observed . at about 11:46:20",

    "were selected areas of the feet using the two connected methods .",
    "the first one delimits the interest area using the box defined as coordinates of the corners ( see table 2 ) , the second delimits the feet with an isophote of 30% intensity of the brightest pixel in this box . in this way the areas of footpoints were estimated in the images of both analysed events",
    ". however , the observed fluxes of the footpoints are not identical ( see table 2 - @xmath44 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "therefore , taking into account the symmetry of the numerical model , the corresponding parameter was calculated as an average of the fluxes of both feet ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the non - thermal footpoint flux is calculated for the model using formula  ( [ eq1 ] ) and additionally from @xmath73 as total intensity below transition region ( @xmath74 ) and integrated in selected energy ranges ( @xmath26 ) . for these calculated fluxes",
    "added value of the background was derived from the _ rhessi _ image ( @xmath57 ) using the box defined as coordinates of the corners ( see table 2 ) . for the lowest energy range ( 6 - 12 kev ) the applied methodology is more complicated . in this energy range and at the time when the images were registered for the analysed flares the thermal component dominates ,",
    "although the non - thermal emission adds a small contribution ( see figures 12 and 13 ) .",
    "therefore , calculated emission of the model in this energy range should be the sum of the thermal ( @xmath63 ) and non - thermal ( @xmath62 ) emissions and such value ( @xmath64 ) is compared with the observations .",
    "the modelled emission was integrated over the entire loop , and also in this case the value of the background is added and derived from the _ rhessi _ image .",
    "the only observed structure of the _ rhessi _ images in this energy range is the flare s loop . as in the case of a high energy range the same two methods of estimation of the areas of loop s emission were used",

    "a much larger inconsistency occurs for the 6 - 12 kev energy range . in this case",
    "the emission calculated from the model is about 20 times greater within an isophote of 30% and about 12 times greater using the box than the observed emissions , respectively .",
    "the obtained result generally agrees with the relations of the synthesized and observed total fluxes shown in figure 12 for the selected time .",
    "results of photometry of the june @xmath1 , 2002 solar flare show that the synthesized emission in the 35 - 45 kev energy range is about 4 times lower than the observed emission within an isophote of 30% . within the defined box",
    "this ratio is about 7 .",
    "good agreement was obtained for the 6 - 12 kev energy range , where emission from the model is about 11% lower for an isophote of 30% , and about 60% lower for the box than the observed emission .",
    "as for the first analysed event , the received result agrees with the relations of the synthesized and observed total fluxes shown in figure 13 for the selected time .",
    "the modelling of the two solar flares observed on february @xmath0 , 2002 and june @xmath33 , 2002 was conducted under the assumption that only non - thermal electron beams delivered energy to the flaring loop via the coulomb collisions and the ntes heating function was calculated based on the parameters derived from observed hxr spectra .",
    "comparison of modelling results with observations shows that sxr and hxr emissions of both single - loop like events could be fully explained by electron beam - driven evaporation only .",
    "there is no need for any additional heating mechanism to explain the observed sxr and hxr emissions and dynamics of the flaring plasma .",
    "the use of the fokker - planck formalism allowed for an improvement of the calculated models , if compared with previous works , by direct comparison of the observed and modelled distributions of the hxr emission .",
    "the best compatibility of the model and the observations was obtained for the june @xmath33 , 2002 event , both the 0.5 - 4   _ goes _ light curve and for total fluxes in 50 - 100 kev , 25 - 50 kev , 12 - 25 kev and 6 - 12 kev energy band .",
    "poorer concordance compared to the first event is obtained for the february @xmath0 , 2002 solar flare . in both cases , the largest differences between the observed and synthesized light curves appeared in the 12 - 25 kev energy range .",
    "this difference is mainly caused by a thermal emission component which gives too small a contribution in this range to the total flux . in higher ranges of energy , differences between the model and the observed fluxes decrease . in these",
    "ranges the non - thermal component dominates .",
    "this behaviour appears to be justified because , even if the plasma distribution in the model does not correspond to the observation , the non - thermal electrons which have high energies can penetrate deeper into the chromosphere and do not interact with matter during their travel in contrast to the low energy non - thermal electrons that convey energy in the higher parts of the flare loop .",
    "the hxr non - thermal emission is directly related to the flux of the accelerated ntes whereas the sxr and hxr thermal emissions are related to the energy deposited by the same ntes flux .",
    "another important factor influencing the differences between the modelled and observed fluxes appearing in the 12 - 25 kev energy range is the assumption that injected electrons have a power law energy spectrum .",
    "as shown by @xcite using the fokker - planck model of particle transport and the injected electron spectrum based on stochastic acceleration , higher coronal temperatures and densities , larger upflow velocities , and faster increases of these quantities are obtained than in the model where electron injection spectrum was of power law .",
    "this is due to the fact that the injected electron spectrum smoothly spans from a quasi - thermal component to a non - thermal tail .",
    "the injected beam of electrons contains a lot of low energy electrons which deposit their energy primarily in the corona and indirectly cause stronger evaporation , and thereby the thermal emission component could give a greater contribution to the total flux in the 12 - 25 kev energy range .",
    "an underestimation of the thermal component in the model may also probably indicates inconsistencies between distributions of the mass in real flaring loops and in their models .",
    "this wrong distribution of mass in the model may arise by relative simplicity of the applied numerical 1d code , coarse estimation of the geometrical loop parameters , errors in _ rhessi _ spectra restoration and beam parameters obtained from fitting ntes , possible problems in a _ goes _",
    "s calibration and by using an analytical formula for ntes heating function . additionally , it is assumed that at the beginning we have an initial , quasi - stationary preflare model of the flaring loop with the mass distribution consistent with the observations and begins to heat the plasma using ntes heating function which was calculated based on the parameters derived from observed hxr spectra .",
    "these parameters are determined by fitting _",
    "spectra and vitiated by errors .",
    "the parameters uncertainties reported by ospex can give some idea of the stability of the fit results .",
    "they do not account for interdependence between fit parameters ( e.g. between the temperature and emission measure values of an isothermal emission component or the power - law index of the electron energy distribution , and low energy cut - off of the electron distribution for the non - thermal component ) and can often underestimate the true uncertainties when the chi - squared space is not well - behaved ( e.g. when it is degenerate along one or more dimensions ) .",
    "additionally , an influence of the thermal component on the spectra can be a source of errors of the derived parameter of electrons distribution .",
    "a detailed analysis of this type of relations and their influences on the derived parameters of the fitted spectra was conducted by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the use of analytical formula for ntes heating function , which is only an approximation , may introduce additional errors into the model .",
    "however , taking into account the results published by @xcite that the model with analytical approximation of heating gives about 10% difference only , compared to the model with a fokker - planck regime , this is an acceptable approximation especially when we consider the benefits of the speed of calculation and all the other errors arising from the simplifications used in the model . as a result of all these factors",
    "the energy will be deposited in different layers of the flare model compared to the real event .",
    "this may lead to receiving other physical parameters of the plasma evolution in the loop model than calculated from observations , particularly the distribution of mass in the flaring loop .",
    "this causes the previously described differences between the observed and synthesized light curves .",
    "one can also assume that at the beginning , an initial , quasi - stationary preflare model of the flaring loop with mass distribution inconsistent with the observations which may be caused by poorly determined geometrical parameters . in this case , even the use of the parameters derived from observed hxr spectra without errors and `` ideal '' ntes heating function will lead to the same effects as in the first case . in reality , however , the analytical heating function is used ( with all its consequences ) and its parameters with errors .",
    "similarly the results of photometry for a high energy range show that the best compliance was obtained for the june @xmath36 , 2002 flare where the synthesized emission in the best case is only 30% higher than the emissions measured from the observation . for the february @xmath0 , 2002 flare ,",
    "synthesized emission is about 4 times lower than the observed one . in the low energy range the best conformity",
    "was obtained for the february @xmath0 , 2002 flare , where emission from the model is only about 11% lower than the observed one .",
    "the larger inconsistency occurs for the june @xmath36 , 2002 solar flare , where synthesized emission in the best case is about 12 times more than emission from observation .",
    "the observed differences which are evident on conducted photometry are primarily caused by the assumption that the model of the flare is symmetric and there are no differences in the emissions originating from the feet of the flare s loop .",
    "in fact , as has been demonstrated already , the observations indicate that this condition is not preserved ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the obtained results are also affected by all the factors that were presented in an earlier discussion .",
    "for instance the obtained errors are similar to results from previous work @xcite and for the non - thermal fits in the decay phase had small formal errors of fitting parameters ( about 1% for @xmath11 and @xmath8 ) , while the statistical errors were of the order of 15 - 25% for @xmath11 and 11 - 19 % for @xmath8 .",
    "the error ranges were determined for each of the analysed events .",
    "the problem of errors may be particularly important for the very early and decay phases of a solar flare where the spectra registered by _ rhessi _ could also be reasonably fitted using a thermal model only with an acceptably low value of @xmath75 estimator . in these cases ,",
    "the temperature values obtained were higher than the temperature calculated from the _ goes _ light curves at the same time .",
    "for the early phase this difference is so high that almost certainly a non - thermal component in the spectra occurred .",
    "this situation is not so clear for the decay phase .",
    "differences of temperature between the _ rhessi _ and _ goes _ are not so large , and amount to about 2 - 3 mk only . in this phase of the flare the thermal component dominates and covers the weak non - thermal component in the spectra .",
    "the argument for the occurrence of non - thermal emission at this stage of the flare can be extended only on the basis of the model where during the decay phase heating is necessary ( see the green dotted curve in figure 8 and 10 ( upper left panel ) representing the evolution of the plasma in the flaring loop without heating ) .",
    "another argument might be an idea presented by @xcite assuming that during this phase non - thermal emission can be below _ rhessi _",
    "s detection threshold .",
    "despite all these problems , flare modelling presented in this paper simulates the main physical processes in the right way .",
    "it is worth stressing that the hd-1d codes are sufficient in modelling of the flaring events occurring in simple , single - loop like configurations of the magnetic field , even in such elaborated applications like a synthesis of the bcs spectra @xcite .",
    "comparison of the synthesized and observed spectra confirm that the distribution of matter and the velocities in the flaring loop agree roughly with the observed values .    in summary ,",
    "as shown in our previous papers @xcite , efficient heating of the flaring plasma by non - thermal electron beams starts in the very early phase of the flare , significantly before the impulsive phase , and lasts a long time during its gradual phase .",
    "this heating is so efficient that no other heating mechanism is necessary to explain emitted sxr and hxr fluxes . in particular , during the gradual phase of the flare a much slower decay of the sxr flux is observed than could be expected from an analytical estimation of energy losses of the flaring plasma by radiation and by conduction @xcite or from hd numerical modelling of the flares ( for example : * ? ? ?",
    "however , the sxr decay time of the solar flares is usually much extended if compared with the previously mentioned cooling times , proving that during this phase of the flares significant heating is also present .",
    "similar conclusions have already been shown in papers by @xcite and @xcite . as demonstrated in the present work for the analysed @xmath76 february , 2002 and @xmath1 june , 2002 flares all of the energy necessary for heating the flaring loops during all phases of the events was supplied by the ntes .",
    "however , please note that this does not preclude the existence of other , secondary sources of heating or mechanisms of energy transfer .    during modelling the flares ,",
    "the light curves for a number of sxr and hxr energy ranges were successfully reproduced .",
    "the use of the extended code with the fokker - planck formalism allowed for an improvement of the calculated models and made it possible to ascertain which components of the emission ( thermal or non - thermal ) play a dominant role in the chosen energy range .",
    "however , taking into account the results of photometry , no doubt a significant refinement of the applied numerical models and more sophisticated implementation of the various physical mechanisms involved are required to achieve a better agreement .",
    "the author acknowledges the _ rhessi _ , and _",

    "<S> in this paper , the energy budgets of two single - loop like flares observed in x - ray are analysed under the assumption that non - thermal electrons ( ntes ) are the only source of plasma heating during all phases of both events . </S>",

    "<S> results of photometry of the individual flaring structures in a high energy range shows that the best compliance occurred for the june @xmath1 , 2002 flare , where the synthesized emissions were 30% or more higher than the observed emissions . for the february @xmath0 , 2002 flare </S>",

    "<S> the larger inconsistency occurs for the june @xmath1 , 2002 solar flare , where synthesized emission is about 12 times greater or even more than the observed emission . </S>",
    "<S> some part of these differences may be caused by inevitable flaws of the applied methodology , like by an assumption that the model of the flare is symmetric and there are no differences in the emissions originating from the feet of the flare s loop and by relative simplicity of the applied numerical 1d code and procedures . </S>",
    "<S> no doubt a significant refinement of the applied numerical models and more sophisticated implementation of the various physical mechanisms involved are required to achieve a better agreement . despite these problems </S>",
    "<S> , a collation of modelled results with observations shows that soft and hard x - ray emissions observed for analysed single - loop like events may be fully explained by electron beam - driven evaporation only . </S>"
