    "multimedia images are widely used in internet communications , so the need for securely transmitting these images over networks has become an essential part of the field of data security . image cryptography plays a vital role in securing confidential images . the purpose of image cryptography is to hide the content of the images by encrypting them so as to make the images unrecognizable to the intruders .",
    "one part of this paper deals with a new image cryptosystem using 2d cellular automata .",
    "+ in general , there are two different methods to protect an image ; they are ( i ) image shuffling and ( ii ) image encryption .",
    "pixels positions are rearranged in image shuffling whereas in image encryption , pixel values and positions are changed . in both the cases it is very essential to check the security of the method .",
    "that means the method should be invulnerable to all attacks .",
    "poorly protected images will always provide information about the original image in statistical analysis . if the encrypted image is indistinguishable from the random image , statistical analyses will not have advantage to break . so testing the randomness in the pixels of encrypted image is the state of the art . in the literature",
    "already there are different tests for checking randomness for 1d data@xcite .",
    "a number of parametric tests are designed for pixel randomness in shuffled and encrypted images@xcite .",
    "a non - parametric test is developed in this paper for checking randomness in the image pixels , which is the first of its kind . + john von neumann proposed a new emerging concept called cellular automata ( ca)@xcite .",
    "ca is a discrete model consisting of regular grid of cells , each in one of the finite number of states .",
    "according to some fixed rule , the state of each cell will be changed in terms of the state of the current cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood .",
    "like 1d , higher dimension ca also can be defined@xcite .",
    "it is already proved that some of the rules of ca will be able to generate complex random patterns@xcite . in the last two decades 1d and 2d",
    "ca s are used in cryptography .",
    "lot of research is going on for ca based image cryptography @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the basics of 2d cellular automata and the 2d ca concepts used for our encryption scheme .",
    "section 3 presents our new non - parametric test for pixel randomness .",
    "section 4 describes our 2d ca based encryption scheme .",
    "section 5 presents the simulation results and performance evaluations .",
    "section 6 gives the concluding remarks .",
    "the extensional behavior of 1d cellular automata is also able to produce complicated patterns in two - dimension .",
    "this extension is significant since this is compared with pattern formation in physical systems .",
    "2d ca is a regular 2d lattice of cells .",
    "each cell has n possible values and is updated in each discrete time steps according to a rule f that depends on the value of sites in some neighbor around it .",
    "there are different types of lattices and neighborhood structures in a 2d ca .",
    "figure 1 shows the two familiar neighborhood structures named as von - neumann neighborhood and moore neighborhood .",
    "the value of @xmath0 of a cell at @xmath1th position in @xmath2th time in a 2d ca with a rule f , that depends only on the cells according to von - neumann neighborhood is evolved from @xmath3 .",

    "these concepts are used for our proposed encryption method .",

    "we have introduced a new test using non - parametric method in statistics for measuring the randomness in the image pixels .",
    "it scores the images , depending upon how far their pixels are i.i.d .",
    "the newly designed 2d ca based encryption scheme first analysed by standard evaluation methods and then the encrypted images are used to validate our newly proposed non - parametric test .",
    "simulation results clearly show that this test can be used for evaluating the quality of any image shuffling and image encryption method.the complexity of the method is @xmath4 , so it can be efficiently implemented . in the proposed non - parametric test we have only used the basic run test to measure the randomness .",
