    "in spin chains , frustration due to competing antiferromagnetic nearest- and comparably strong next - nearest - neighbor coupling leads to the appearance of a new gapped , dimerized phase@xcite whose properties are markedly different from that of the uniform spin - liquid state of the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain .",
    "a much richer phase diagram is found in spin ladders , where the couplings between nearest - neighbor spins situated along the legs and on the rungs of the ladder may compete . these phases and the quantum phase transitions between them",
    "have been extensively studied recently , both experimentally and theoretically.@xcite the theoretical approaches include both analytic and numerical work . the analytic treatment of the bosonized form of the spin hamiltonian has been widely used to predict the phase diagram .",
    "@xcite there is general agreement that , in two - leg spin ladders , the most relevant operator generates either a topologically ordered rung - singlet or a haldane phase , depending on the relative strength of the intraleg and interleg couplings .",
    "the competition between the couplings is , however , a delicate problem when the intraleg and the interleg couplings are of the same order of magnitude , and the type of order is , in some cases , determined by marginally relevant terms generated within the renormalization group ( rg ) procedure . among the many terms",
    "generated , operators leading to dimerization appear . on this basis,@xcite",
    "it was proposed that a dimerized phase appears between the topologically ordered rung - singlet and the haldane phases for the so - called cross - coupled ladder , in which spins are coupled not only along the legs and across the rungs but also diagonally , i.e. , on opposite legs and on different , neighboring rungs .",
    "the existence of an analogous dimerized phase induced by four - spin exchange terms has been proposed some time ago.@xcite this dimerized phase has indeed been found to exist numerically.@xcite it is also well - established that a dimerized phase exists when a second - neighbor interaction on the legs of the ladder are present @xcite or when the interleg coupling is ferromagnetic.@xcite the existence of the dimerized phase has , however , been disputed for ladders with pairwise spin interactions only,@xcite while other work has presented evidence supporting the presence of this phase.@xcite    the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) procedure invented by white@xcite is a particularly useful numerical method to study such problems because it makes possible the high - precision calculation of the ground - state properties and low - lying excitations of low - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "the dmrg has indeed been widely used @xcite to explore the possible phases of spin ladders .",
    "the length of the ladders from which finite - size scaling is done and the accuracy of the dmrg calculation can be , however , decisive . motivated mainly by the recent work of hikihara and starykh@xcite , we have undertaken a careful analysis of the numerical data to see if there is indeed compelling evidence for the dimerized phase in the cross - coupled ladder using the dmrg procedure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we summarize earlier results on the phase diagram of the cross - coupled frustrated antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 ladder",
    ". the aspects of the dmrg procedure that determine its accuracy are briefly discussed in sec .",
    "our numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "finally sec .",
    "v contains our conclusions .",
    "we treat a two - leg spin-1/2 ladder with pairwise heisenberg couplings along the legs , across the rungs , and diagonally between sites on adjacent rungs , but on opposite legs .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the spin operators on rung @xmath5 and legs 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "a depiction of the couplings of the cross - coupled ladder is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : composite ] .    here we will consider only antiferromagnetic coupling and set the intraleg coupling to unity , @xmath6 which we take as the energy scale in the problem . for @xmath7",
    ", it has been established that the entire half - line @xmath8 of the ground - state phase diagram , is continuously connected,@xcite i.e. , no phase transition occurs for any finite value of @xmath9 .",
    "since the configuration that dominates the ground - state wave function is the product of rung singlets , this phase is often referred to as the _ rung - singlet _ ( rs ) phase .",
    "conversely , for @xmath10 , the entire half - line @xmath11 is continuously connected to the _ haldane phase _",
    "@xcite of the spin-1 chain and the system is known to have a gapped spectrum of spin-1 magnons .",
    "when both @xmath9 and @xmath12 are finite , frustration due to competition between the intraleg and the rung or diagonal interleg couplings potentially leads to the formation of new phases .",
    "indications for such new phases are given by analytic calculations which can be performed for weak interchain couplings using the bosonized form of the hamiltonian .",
    "the leading term in the hamiltonian is the coupling between the staggered magnetizations of the legs : @xmath13 this term generates a gap in the spectrum irrespective of the sign of the coefficient @xmath14 .",
    "rung singlets are generated for @xmath15 , while the haldane phase appears for @xmath16 .",
    "the first numerical results on the model @xcite were consistent with a first - order transition for both weak and strong interchain couplings .",
    "subsequent work has suggested that the transition is actually continuous when the interchain coupling is weak , becoming first - order only for stronger interchain coupling.@xcite this scenario has been supported further by an analysis based on quantum information entropies.@xcite although two critical values of the coupling were found in the two - site entropy function for finite systems in this work , it was shown that they scale to a single value in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it was therefore argued that a direct transition between the rung singlet and the haldane phases takes place .",
    "when @xmath17 , the most relevant term is suppressed at the transition between the two gapped phases and other , less relevant terms may play a role .",
    "in particular , such terms lead to the prediction of a spontaneously dimerized phase.@xcite the boundaries of this dimerized phase have been estimated to lie at @xmath18 the most recent numerical results , however , indicate a much narrower range for the existence of the dimerized phase.@xcite in ref .   the dimerized phase was claimed to exist in the range @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "the authors of ref .   chose a single point in the middle of this range , namely @xmath21 , @xmath20 to demonstrate the existence of the dimerized phase . in what follows",
    ", we will also restrict ourselves to the vicinity of this single point in parameter space and will carry out a careful numerical analysis of the dimer order parameter in the range @xmath22 for @xmath20 .",
    "in the standard dmrg procedure , the chain is divided into two blocks and two extra sites .",
    "as the two sites are incorporated into larger blocks during the steps of the renormalization procedure , only a fraction of the new block states are kept ; the others are discarded .",
    "usually the number of block states , @xmath23 , kept in the truncation procedure ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand and is set according to the accuracy required and the available computational resources.@xcite    as we have pointed out in previous work , keeping the number of block states constant for increasingly large system sizes leads to increasing error , @xcite i.e. , the scaling of block entropy with system size is not taken into account.@xcite in a consistent calculation , the number of block states must be increased as system size is increased . the finite - size scaling to infinite system size",
    "must be accompained by a systematic increase of @xmath23 , and the @xmath24 limit must be taken .",
    "we have shown that the proper choice of @xmath23 can be determined by the so - called dynamic block state selection ( dbss ) approach,@xcite in which the threshold value of the quantum information loss @xmath25 is fixed _ a priori_. in this approach , the number of block states to be kept is obtained from the criterion @xmath26 , where @xmath0 and @xmath27 stand for the block entropy before and after the truncation , respectively .",
    "the minimum number of block states @xmath28 is set prior to the calculation , and the maximum number of block states needed to achieve the desired accuracy , @xmath29 , is monitored during the dmrg process .",
    "this allows for a rigorous control of the numerical accuracy and gives a stable extrapolation to @xmath30 .      in an earlier",
    "work@xcite we used the generalization of the so - called hidden topological order,@xcite @xmath31 , to two - leg ladders , @xmath32 ( s_{j,1}^z + s_{j,2}^z ) \\bigg\\rangle \\ , ,        \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath33 ( s_{j+1,1}^z + s_{j,2}^z ) \\bigg\\rangle \\ , ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to identify various spin - liquid phases.@xcite the advantage of these specially constructed order parameters is that only one of them can be finite in a given phase and they both vanish for critical systems .",
    "unfortunately , the rung - singlet and dimerized phases would fall into the same topological sector because @xmath34 is finite for both cases .",
    "thus , they can not be distinguished by the topological order .",
    "a similar problem arises for the so - called @xmath35 operators,@xcite which can also be used to distinguish different odd- or even - parity valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) states .",
    "the operator @xmath36 \\right\\rangle\\,,\\ ] ] defined for ladders with periodic boundary conditions , converges to @xmath37 in the rung - singlet phase and to @xmath38 in the haldane phase , while the operator @xmath39 \\right\\rangle\\ ] ] converges to @xmath38 and @xmath37 , respectively , in the two topologically distinct phases .",
    "they give a clear indication of the parity of the number of singlet bonds  cut \" by a line between adjacent rungs , but they do not distinguish between the columnar - dimer phase and the rung - singlet phase .    since we are looking for a possible columnar - dimer phase only , a more natural quantity to examine",
    "is the local dimer order parameter @xmath40 defined as @xmath41 with @xmath42 thus , dimerization is measured as the alternation in the bond energy in the middle of a sufficiently long open chain . here",
    "@xmath43 is finite when the translational symmetry of the hamiltonian is spontaneously broken in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is worth noting that our definition is slightly different from the one used in ref .   for the columnar phase , where only the intraleg part of the spin couplings was included .",
    "although , quantitatively the two definitions give different values for the order parameter , the qualitative behavior is the same .    for noncritical models with a finite correlation length , the end effects decay exponentially and the local quantity @xmath44 is expected to vary to leading order as @xmath45 this behavior is qualitatively similar to the scaling of the gap for periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , except that the scaling variable is the distance of the middle of the chain from the boundary , @xmath46 , and",
    "the exponent @xmath47 of the algebraic prefactor is , _ a priori _ , unknown . here",
    "@xmath48 stands for the correlation length , which is finite for gapped systems . the exponential convergence of local quantities such as the dimer order parameter @xmath44 makes the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit more reliable.@xcite in cases",
    "when the available data for @xmath44 not show a tendency to go to a finite value as a function of @xmath49 , we also carry out extrapolations without the exponential term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scale_d ] ) .",
    "in addition , in order to obtain an upper bound for @xmath43 , we also use a second order polynomial fit in @xmath49 .",
    "since the numerical accuracy is of crucial importance in the present study , we analyze the behavior of the dimer order parameter as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath25 systematically .",
    "as mentioned above , the dimerized phase exists , if it exists at all , in a narrow region around @xmath50 .",
    "we first calculate the length - dependent @xmath44 using open boundary conditions ( obc ) on systems of up to @xmath51 rungs in steps of @xmath52 .",
    "we perform four dmrg sweeps with fixed numbers of block states , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "in summary , we have carried out density - matrix renormalization - group calculations on the @xmath102 cross - coupled spin ladder , in which , in addition to antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor couplings along the legs and across the rungs of the ladder , an antiferromagnetic coupling between spins diagonally across the plaquettes is present .",
    "our aim was to search for indications for the gapped columnar dimer phase found by starykh and balents,@xcite in view of the fact that earlier numerical work @xcite only provided hints that this phase might exist .",
    "since it is known that the dimerized phase , if it exists , appears in a small parameter regime due to the marginally relevant character of the current - current coupling between the legs , we have performed the numerical calculations using the dmrg in a narrow region in the parameter space , namely for @xmath103 and have analyzed the accuracy of the calculation carefully . whereas the longest ladder studied in ref .",
    "had 192 rungs and a maximum of 500 states were kept , we have carried out calculations for ladders with @xmath51 rungs keeping @xmath59 states and with @xmath63 rungs keeping @xmath72 states . when the dimer order parameter is plotted as a function of @xmath56 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : d - n ] ) , the curves seem to tend to a finite value for large systems ; the slope tends to zero .",
    "this was interpreted in ref .   as an indication of the existence of the dimerized phase . however , when more and more states are kept , this tendency becomes less and less pronounced .",
    "when the dimer order parameter calculated for different @xmath23 values is extrapolated to @xmath24 , @xmath43 curves downwards as a function of @xmath49 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : d - m](b ) .",
    "in fact , finite - size scaling of the extrapolated @xmath69 data in the whole region @xmath103 using eq .",
    "yielded a dimer order parameter of order @xmath104 or smaller .",
    "in addition , at a particular point of the parameter space , @xmath105 , at which the phase is most likely to occur we have also performed calculations using the dbss method taking a number of different fixed values for the quantum information loss @xmath25 for ladders of up to @xmath63 rungs keeping up to 2500 block states and performing an extrapolation to @xmath96 .",
    "one important message of this calculation is that if longer ladders are to be considered , the number of states kept in the dmrg procedure must be taken to be up to approximately 10000 to obtain sufficient accuracy .",
    "this indicates the fundamental limitation of the dmrg method for the cross - coupled spin ladder .",
    "we have found that the result obtained for the dimer order parameter in the @xmath106 limit coincides with the one obtained from the @xmath24 limit .",
    "the extrapolated data do not show upward curvature as a function of @xmath49 , in contrast to the results obtained on shorter chains with a smaller number of block states kept .",
    "the limiting value for @xmath71 depends strongly on the functional form used for the extrapolation . according to our best estimate ,",
    "the maximum possible value of the dimer order parameter is of the order of the error of the calculation . while it can not be completely ruled out that the curvature of @xmath44 as a function of @xmath49 changes at much larger system sizes if there is a very small dimerization gap and a very large correlation length , there is no indication of such behavior in the present calculations .",
    "therefore , we find that whether or not the columnar dimer phase is present anywhere in the phase diagram of the cross - coupled antiferromagnetic ladder remains an open question ."
