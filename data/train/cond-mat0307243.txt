    "the decay of homogeneous and isotropic , _ fluid _ turbulence has been the subject of extensive theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite studies . these include wind - tunnel experiments downstream of a grid@xcite and flow behind a towed grid in a stationary channel filled with helium ii@xcite .",
    "however , unambiguous statements can still not be made about the dependence of the decay of fluid turbulence on the initial conditions . in experiments ,",
    "these can be changed to some extent by changing the grid geometry and choice of virtual origin@xcite but caution is advised in interpreting the results since our ability to choose initial conditions precisely is severely restricted . in an earlier study@xcite , the energy - decay exponents were predicted to be initial - condition dependent , but the precise nature of this dependence was not elucidated clearly .",
    "direct numerical simulations ( dns ) can control initial conditions , but , to the best of our knowledge , have investigated a very limited class of initial conditions .",
    "a recent exception@xcite is a study of the decay of fluid turbulence for the set of initial conditions with a power - law initial energy spectrum @xmath2 , where the superscript @xmath3 denotes the choice of virtual origin of time @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the magnitude of the wave vector , and the exponent @xmath6 distinguishes different initial conditions in this set .",
    "results , both experimental and numerical , for the decay of _ magnetohydrodynamic _ ( mhd ) turbulence are even more scarce than their fluid - turbulence analogs .",
    "different power - law decays have been suggested in dns@xcite studies , but the sensitivity of these decays to the initial conditions or evolution of the relevant length scale has not been investigated in any detail .    in this paper , we initiate such an investigation and obtain the following interesting results : we show first how to generalise the results of ref . @xcite and derive , for unforced , incompressible , homogeneous and isotropic@xcite three - dimensional mhd ( 3dmhd ) turbulence , expressions for the decay of the kinetic and magnetic energies and the growth of the taylor and integral scales , when we start with power - law initial conditions @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , where the subscript * a * is * v * for the kinetic energy and * b * for the magnetic energy . such initial conditions are of interest in the astrophysical context of the decay of power - law ` primordial ' energy spectra@xcite .",
    "we also derive bounds for the decay of the cross- and magnetic helicity.we then show by systematic numerical studies of a shell model for mhd turbulence@xcite and an @xmath9 pseudospectral dns of the 3dmhd equations that , given power - law initial conditions , the kinetic and magnetic energies and the taylor and integral scales follow the decay expressions mentioned above within a regime governed by the temporal evolution of the integral scales .",
    "the unforced mhd equations are @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath12 is the magnetic viscosity , @xmath13 is the effective pressure , and @xmath14 is the pressure .",
    "we enforce the incompressibility condition @xmath15 and eliminate @xmath16 in the usual manner .",
    "the invariants of inviscid , unforced 3dmhd are the total energy ( @xmath17 ) , the cross - helicity ( @xmath18 ) , and the magnetic helicity ( @xmath19 , where * a * is the vector potential ) . we restrict ourselves to the case with @xmath20 close to zero and exclude any helical contributions@xcite to the decay process due to the inverse cascade of @xmath21 .",

    "our study also has some implications for suggestions of ` strong universality ' in decaying turbulence as we discuss below .    in an early study@xcite , an expression for the kinetic- energy density",
    "was hypothesized by assuming the existence of an ` eddy - viscosity ' . an energy decay similar to what we get for @xmath43",
    "was then considered in the context of decaying fluid turbulence . however",
    ", this study did not consider the initial - condition dependence of the decay laws or the effect of the growth of the relevant length scales .",
    "in a recent study@xcite , arguments have been given for ` strong universality ' in forced and decaying fluid turbulence in a shell model .",
    "for decaying turbulence , this means that scaling exponents of the @xmath71-th order velocity structure functions and their coefficients in the isotropic sector , normalised by the mean energy flux , are universal and the same as those for structure functions that are obtained for forced turbulence . for the purpose of our discussion here , this would imply that , irrespective of the initial condition used , after an initial period of decay , the energy spectrum should evolve towards one with a part that goes as @xmath177 ( aside from multiscaling corrections which we are not concerned with here ) .",

    "@xcite . in particular ,",
    "if we start with equal initial kinetic and magnetic energies in the first two shells , the mhd - shell - model simulations exhibit an energy cascade to higher shells .",
    "once this cascade process is complete , the energy densities display a part that can be fitted to a @xmath177 form and the integral scale moves towards small wavenumbers .",
    "the point we would like to highlight here is that the evolution to a @xmath177-type energy spectrum does not occur for the power - law initial conditions we have concentrated on in this paper .",
    "this is especially clear in the mhd - shell - model studies shown in fig .",
    "[ spectrashell ] .",
    "the reason for this is the ` permanence of large eddies ' : for small @xmath5 , the energy spectrum retains the power - law dependence of the initial energy spectrum .",
    "deviations from this initial power law become significant only for times @xmath64 , at which the time - dependent integral scale @xmath63 becomes comparable to the size of the system .",
    "given the parameters , such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , that we have used , by time @xmath1 , the reynolds numbers is sufficiently low that a fresh energy - cascade to large @xmath5 is not established again .",
    "thus , suggestions of ` strong universality ' should be made with caution , for they apply only to a class of initial conditions that does not include the power - law initial conditions used here for the decay of 3dmhd turbulence .",
    "the initial conditions used in ref .",
    "@xcite are also qualitatively different from those that we use here in so far as they begin with a large energy in a few fourier modes .",
    "thus they develop energy cascades and do not explore the types of decay that are associated with the ` permanence of large eddies ' we concentrate on here .",

    "<S> we derive relations for the decay of the kinetic and magnetic energies and the growth of the taylor and integral scales in unforced , incompressible , homogeneous and isotropic three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( 3dmhd ) turbulence with power - law initial energy spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive bounds for the decay of the cross- and magnetic helicities . we then present results from systematic numerical studies of such decay both within the context of an mhd shell model and direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of 3dmhd . </S>",
    "<S> we show explicitly that our results about the power - law decay of the energies hold for times @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the time at which the integral scales become comparable to the system size . for @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results are consistent with those predicted by the principle of ` permanence of large eddies ' . </S>"
