    "functional determinants of ( ordinary or partial ) differential operators arise in many areas of physics : for instance , in connection with the one - loop effective action in quantum field - theoretic studies and in the semiclassical approximation to quantum mechanical tunneling amplitudes .",
    "however , explicit evaluation of these quantities , especially with partial differential operators involving nontrivial background fields , is usually a very difficult problem .",
    "explicit analytic results are known only in some simple cases , such as the one - loop effects in constant electromagnetic fields in qed @xcite and in a covariantly constant field strength in non - abelian gauge theories @xcite .",
    "therefore various methods for approximate calculation were considered , the large mass expansion @xcite and the derivative expansion @xcite being good examples of them .",
    "but the validity of these approximate methods crucially depends on the range of various parameters entering the problem .",
    "recently there has been a significant progress in this problem , at least when the differential operators are separable .",
    "especially , for background fields having radial symmetry , a method using the partial wave analysis has been developed in the form of the partial wave cutoff method @xcite .",
    "this method was first used in the computation of qcd instanton determinant @xcite for an arbitrary value of quark mass .",
    "( the same quantity with massless quarks was calculated in a classic paper by thooft @xcite long time ago ) .",
    "it was then applied to the evaluation of the one loop effective action for more general classes of radial background fields @xcite .",
    "the prefactor in the false vacuum decay rate , which requires an evaluation of the functional determinant also , is calculated by the same method @xcite .    of crucial importance in the above - mentioned calculational scheme",
    "is to find a simple way to extract a finite renormalized quantity from the infinite sum of partial wave contributions . in @xcite",
    "this was achieved by introducing a cutoff in the partial wave sum and then finding a uniform radial wkb expansion for the sum of partial waves beyond the cutoff value ( which is combined with the conventional renormalization counterterms ) . combining the leading terms of this wkb expansion with the contribution from partial waves below the cutoff value , it is possible to secure a finite renormalized value in the limit of large cutoff value . [ in @xcite ,",
    "similar results were obtained using the zeta function technique ] .",
    "more recently it is observed that the inclusion of higher order terms in the uniform radial wkb expansion greatly improves the rate of convergence for the infinite sum of partial wave contributions @xcite .",
    "the computational labour needed for the functional determinant calculation is thus much reduced .",
    "efficiency of this scheme will become especially conspicuous for functional determinants of higher - dimensional differential operators , thus making it an effective tool also for the studies of higher - dimensional quantum field theories .",
    "in the present paper we will give a simplified derivation of the uniform wkb expansion and provide explicitly several leading terms of this expansion ( needed for fast precision evaluation of functional determinants ) in general contexts .",
    "it is our hope that these explicit results find useful applications in various related problems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ setupsection ] the partial wave cutoff method",
    "is explained briefly and the desired form of the asymptotic wkb series is presented . in section [ wkbsection ] , after introducing the proper - time representation of the radial functional determinant , we derive the large @xmath2 expansion of the proper - time green function . in section [ radialsection ] the infinite sum of contributions from high angular momentum is explicitly evaluated using the radial wkb series and the euler - maclaurin summation method and then the uniform wkb expansions ( as descending series in the angular momentum cutoff @xmath3 ) are presented in various dimensions i.e. , for @xmath4 .",
    "our formulas for the renormalized functional determinants have definitely faster convergence property compared , say , to those given in @xcite . in the next section we consider a direct application of these results ,",
    "finding a more accurate value for the false vacuum decay rate in the context of 4d scalar field theory . in section [ gaugesection ]",
    "we consider the functional determinant in gauge theories , where the radial potential has a linear dependence in angular quantum number @xmath2 .",
    "but this does not change the general structure , and in this case also the appropriate coefficient functions in the uniform wkb expansion can be found in explicit forms .",
    "in order to set the problem precisely , let us start by considering a pair of partial differential operators @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the laplace operator in @xmath1 dimension and @xmath7 is a radial potential vanishing sufficiently fast at infinity .",
    "in the one - dimensional case ( i.e. , with @xmath8 ) with the dirichlet boundary condition on the interval @xmath9 , we can determine the ratio of two functional determinants of the operators with mass @xmath10 , using the gelfand and yaglom s theorem @xcite , as @xmath11 where the wave function @xmath12 satisfies the ordinary differential equation ( ode ) @xmath13 with initial value conditions at @xmath14 : @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the other function @xmath17 is the solution to the differential equation @xmath18 with the same initial conditions .",
    "this method turns the problem of finding an infinite number of eigenvalues into that of finding the solutions to the ode initial value problems .",
    "now we consider the case of higher dimensions ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) .",
    "[ in this paper we will provide explicit formulas for the cases with @xmath4 but the extension to higher dimension is also straightforward ] .",
    "when the potential is radial , i.e. , @xmath20 , we can use the partial wave analysis , taking advantage of the spherical symmetry .",
    "formally , for the radially separable operators given in ( [ op ] ) , the logarithm of the determinant ratio can be written as a sum of the logarithm of radial ( that is , one - dimensional ) determinant ratios : @xmath21}{\\det[{\\cal m}^{\\rm free}+m^2 ] } \\right ) = \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty g_l(d ) \\ln\\left ( \\frac{\\det[{\\cal m}_l+m^2]}{\\det[{\\cal m}_l^{\\rm free}+m^2 ] }   \\right ) .",

    "the associated radial differential operator@xmath23 is given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 has the same form as @xmath23 but without the potential term @xmath7 .",
    "the individual radial determinant ratio in ( [ detlsum ] ) is finite and it can be evaluated easily by using the above gelfand - yaglom method ; but the sum over @xmath2 leads to a divergent result .",
    "this problem is related to renormalization and an elegant method to extract the finite or renormalized expression @xmath26 from @xmath27 ( after a suitable regularization and renormalization ) is presented in @xcite .",
    "we are concerned here with more practical problem , which should be addressed if one wants the full , including the finite part , expression of @xmath26 .",
    "the rate of convergence of the @xmath2-sum in ( [ detlsum ] ) is quite slow , and we require an efficient method to deal with this @xmath2-sum . to this end",
    "it is convenient to introduce a partial wave cutoff @xmath3 @xcite and to split the sum into two pieces , i.e. , the low angular momentum part @xmath28 and the high angular momentum part @xmath29 : @xmath30}{\\det[{\\cal m}_l^{\\rm free}+m^2 ] } \\right ) , \\label{lcut1}\\\\ & & \\omega_{\\rm h } = \\sum_{l = l+1}^\\infty g_l(d ) \\ln\\left ( \\frac{\\det[{\\cal m}_l+m^2]}{\\det[{\\cal m}_l^{\\rm free}+m^2 ] } \\right)+ \\delta\\omega , \\label{lcut2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 denotes the ` conventional ' renormalization counterterm .",
    "separate treatment of @xmath28 and @xmath29 constitute the crux of the partial wave cutoff method .",
    "the part @xmath28 ( see ( [ lcut1 ] ) ) can be evaluated with the help of the gelfand - yaglom method .",
    "since the determinant ratio for given @xmath2 behaves like @xmath32 for large @xmath2 and the degeneracy factor @xmath33 increases as @xmath34 , it should be clear that @xmath28 behaves like @xmath35 for @xmath36 and like @xmath37 for @xmath38 in the large @xmath3 limit .",
    "( this reveals the divergent structures in the formal expression in ( [ detlsum ] ) ) .",
    "as for the part @xmath29 which involves the sum of all partial wave contributions with @xmath39 , we can evaluate it _ analytically _ in a uniform asymptotic series of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 s may have an implicit @xmath3 dependency of @xmath42 and @xmath43 behaves as @xmath44 in the large @xmath3 limit .",
    "this uniform nature makes also the @xmath45 integrals in ( [ asympl ] ) well - defined . to find explicit forms of the @xmath46 s",
    ", we take the proper - time representation for the functional determinant of radial operators for each partial wave and then use the quantum mechanical radial - wkb expansion which becomes exact in the large @xmath2 limit . for the desired large @xmath3 expansion we then perform the sum over @xmath47 with the help of the euler - maclaurin method .",
    "these are given in following sections .",
    "note that , as @xmath48 , unsuppressed terms in the expansion ( [ asympl ] ) may grow like @xmath49 , but they match precisely the large-@xmath3 divergences coming from @xmath28 except for the sign .",
    "hence , combining the large-@xmath3-unsuppressed terms of @xmath29 with @xmath28 and taking @xmath48 limit , we get a finite renormalized quantity @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath50 . \\label{subtracted}\\ ] ] in @xcite , dunne and kirsten identified this expression for @xmath0 by using the zeta function technique .    in principle , since ( [ subtracted ] ) yields a well - defined expression , one can use this expression to obtain the renormalized functional determinant .",
    "but we still have a practical problem determining @xmath28 . since it is generally not possible to find a master formula for the determinant ratio valid for all @xmath2 , we have to evaluate ( numerically ) those partial wave contributions corresponding to the angular momentum range @xmath51 , to be able to determine @xmath28 .",
    "because of the slow rate of convergence , a very large number of these determinant terms should be thus considered to get a sufficiently good result for the sum .",
    "there is a rather simple way to secure a reliable large-@xmath3 limit value in ( [ subtracted ] ) with a relatively small number of partial wave contributions . including the @xmath52-suppressed terms of the expansion ( [ asympl ] ) inside the squared braces in ( [ subtracted ] ) would make the sum converge faster , thereby reducing the number of partial - wave determinants to be evaluated explicitly . to appreciate this better , note that if we were able to calculate both of @xmath28 and @xmath29 _ exactly _ , their sum would be independent of the choice of the cutoff @xmath3 .",
    "this implies that , leaving aside possible numerical inaccuracy in calculating @xmath28 , the @xmath3-dependency in the sum for finite value of the cutoff @xmath3 is really due to our ignoring of the @xmath52-suppressed contributions in the asymptotic series ( [ asympl ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible to reduce this undesired @xmath3-dependency systematically by taking into account the ( ignored ) higher order terms in the @xmath52-series .",
    "now , instead of taking the strict @xmath48 limit in ( [ subtracted ] ) , we can write the following formula for @xmath26 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 refers to the order of truncation . in this formula",
    "the error is indicated by the last term and it is totally under control .",
    "it is apparent that , for a given value of the cutoff @xmath3 , we get more accurate value of @xmath26 by taking into account more @xmath52-suppressed terms . or , for a given accuracy , we can lower the value of @xmath3 by including some @xmath52-suppressed terms . we can thus use ( [ truncated ] ) as the basis of precision calculation for functional determinants . in this work ,",
