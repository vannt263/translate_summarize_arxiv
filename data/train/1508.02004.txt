    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the heg is arguably the most important model of interacting electrons .",
    "however , in real systems , the background charge density due to the atomic nuclei is non - uniform and so the electron density varies in space . in order to study the performance of the pseudopotential in an inhomogeneous system , we perform dmc calculations of the energy of the lithium and beryllium atoms .",
    "these atoms are simple real - life systems that could expose errors introduced by three - body scattering .",
    "accurate reference results from analytic integration and recursion relations  @xcite are also available , making these systems an ideal test bed for evaluating the performance of the electron - electron pseudopotential .",
    "the trial wavefunction is constructed from single - particle orbitals in a gaussian basis set generated by an all - electron calculation performed using crystal  @xcite .",
    "the trial wavefunction consists of a determinant of dft orbitals multiplied by a jastrow correlation factor .",
    "the parameters in the jastrow factor are optimized using a variance minimization technique  @xcite .",
    "the optimized vmc wavefunction is used as a starting point for a dmc calculation .",
    "we first study a solitary li atom , containing one down - spin and two up - spin electrons .",
    "we present our estimates for the ground state energy in electronvolts for ready comparison with the real - life system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lithium](a ) we show the variation of the accuracy compared with the pure coulomb interaction .",
    "the energy for the exact coulomb system , @xmath6ev , agrees with reference results from analytic integration and recursion relations  @xcite within @xmath7ev per atom .",
    "the error decreases as the cutoff radius is reduced .",
    "if we aim for an error of order chemical accuracy ( @xmath8ev per atom ) we require @xmath9 .",
    "[ fig : lithium](d ) shows that relative to the calculation with the coulomb interaction , the smoother pseudopotential reduces the local variance and therefore accelerates the calculation , with greater effect for larger cutoff radii .",
    "the pseudopotential offers a speedup by a factor of @xmath10 while still attaining chemical accuracy .",
    "the results for the be atom follow the same trend as for the li atom .",
    "for the be atom we predict a ground state energy of @xmath11ev per atom , again within @xmath12ev of reference results from analytic integration and recursion relations  @xcite .",
    "the pseudopotential performs slightly better for the be than the li atom , possibly due to the increased prevalence of electron - electron relative to electron - ion interaction terms .",
    "we also determine the energy of the li@xmath13 and be@xmath13 ions in fig .",
    "[ fig : lithium](b ) .",
    "the error is now significantly reduced due to the removal of the three - body error for li@xmath13 , and its reduction for be@xmath13 .",
    "the growth of the error in the energy estimate is similar to that for the li and be atoms .",
    "this means that in fig .",
    "[ fig : lithium](c ) the magnitude of the error in the ionization energy grows with cutoff radius .",
    "we attain chemical accuracy ( @xmath8ev per atom ) at @xmath14 .    for a fixed target accuracy the speedup of the pseudopotential calculation for the li and",
    "be atoms is smaller than for the heg .",
    "this is because in the heg we focused on the error per electron , whereas here we focus on the error per atom , which includes three or four electrons , therefore inflating the error .",
    "however , even if we ignore this , the electron - electron pseudopotential offers a @xmath15-times acceleration for high accuracy work , whereas for example , for high throughput structure prediction calculations an order of magnitude less accuracy is required  @xcite so a pseudopotential would offer a @xmath16-times speedup . for a molecule chemical accuracy typically relates to the energy difference between two configurations rather than total energy for which the pseudopotential is expected to be more accurate .",
    "we have developed a pseudopotential for the repulsive coulomb interaction .",
    "the pseudopotential delivers accurate scattering states for incident wave vectors and angular momentum channels found in an electron gas , while its smoothness accelerates computation . with the cutoff radius set to the typical electron separation the pseudopotential delivers the correct many - body physics , and within the cutoff radius two - body physics dominates where",
    "predictions for the exchange correlation hole can be corrected analytically .",
    "the cutoff radius can be reduced to zero , making the pseudopotential systematically improvable .",
    "the pseudopotential was shown to deliver chemical accuracy for the heg and to accelerate both the dmc and cid methods by a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "the pseudopotentials were also shown to accelerate the calculation of the isolated lithium and beryllium atom by a factor of @xmath15 for high accuracy work , and in situations where lower accuracy is required , for example high throughput structure prediction calculations , the pseudopotentials would provide a @xmath16-times acceleration .",
    "the performance and simplicity of the electron - electron pseudopotential makes it portable across many - body techniques such as vmc , dmc , truncated ci , coupled cluster theory , and mller - plesset theory .",
    "the formalism developed can be applied more widely in scattering problems in condensed matter to develop pseudopotentials for dipolar interactions and also the contact interactions found in atomic gases  @xcite .",
    "the approach can also be applied to classical physics , for example the coulomb interaction studied here has the same force law as newtonian gravity used in simulations of galactic dynamics  @xcite . here",
    "a pseudopotential could overcome the high computational cost and correctly capture the motion of stars during close encounters .",
