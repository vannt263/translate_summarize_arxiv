    "binary neutron stars ( bnss ) are the leading candidates for the central engine of short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ; @xcite ) .",
    "they are also one of the most powerful sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) , and advanced interferometric detectors are expected to observe these sources at rates of @xmath4 events per year  @xcite .",
    "fully general - relativistic simulations have shown how such mergers can lead to the formation of hypermassive neutron stars ( hmnss ) , i.e. , of nss with masses larger than the maximum mass that can be supported by uniform rotation .",
    "due to loss of angular momentum via gw emission and magnetic fields , the hmns eventually collapses in less than @xmath5 to a black hole ( bh ) surrounded by an accretion disk  @xcite .",
    "when magnetic fields are present , they can provide a mechanism to extract energy from the bh and disk , and power collimated relativistic jets  @xcite .",
    "a source of uncertainty in bns simulations is due to the lack of detailed knowledge of the equation of state ( eos ) of nss ( see  @xcite for a recent discussion of eoss ) .",
    "current observations have shown that nss with masses of @xmath6 exist  @xcite , and therefore the ns eos must support a mass at least as large as that .",
    "this opens the interesting possibility that the merger of bnss could produce not only hmnss , but also nss which are stable against gravitational collapse .",
    "this possibility has interesting applications for observations of sgrbs  @xcite , as well as for the possible emission of long periodic gw signals  @xcite and their electromagnetic counterparts  @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that several of the sgrbs that show a plateau phase in the x - ray lightcurve may be explained with the formation of a stable magnetar after the bns merger .",
    "x - ray lightcurves indeed suggest a long - lived central engine  @xcite , which is hard to explain if all the bns mergers produce an hmns which collapses to a bh in less than @xmath7 ; the remnant torus is also expected to be completely accreted on the same timescale  @xcite , unless magnetic or gravitational instabilities set in  @xcite .",
    "the formation of a stable magnetar could also explain the extended emission observed in several sgrbs  @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we investigate , for the first time and in fully general - relativistic mhd , the regime in which bnss may lead to the formation of a stable ns . by considering models with and without magnetic fields , and by performing the longest ( to date ) general relativistic simulations of magnetized bns mergers , we show that stable magnetized nss can indeed be formed for some range of masses , and we discuss the implications of these new results for the electromagnetic signals that they may emit .",
    "note that the formation of a stable magnetar is a non - trivial outcome ; in fact , even if the total mass of a bns system is below the maximum mass , collapse to bh may still happen if the central density of the merger product is above a certain value ( depending on the eos ) .",
    "nss with masses below the maximum mass can indeed collapse to bhs ( e.g. , model d0 in  @xcite ) , and the stability properties of nss are defined by both their masses and central densities  @xcite . in this letter , together with presenting the first simulation of the formation of a stable ns from a binary merger , we also discuss the ns final spin , the formation of a disk , magnetic field amplification , the gw signal , and possible electromagnetic counterparts .",

    "we use a system of units in which @xmath25 , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "the simulations presented here were performed using the publicly available einstein toolkit  @xcite , coupled with our fully general relativistic mhd code ` whisky `  @xcite .",
    "details about the numerical methods can be found in  @xcite , except that in our work the spacetime evolution is obtained using the ` mclachlan ` code  @xcite , and ` whisky ` now implements the modified lorenz gauge to evolve the vector potential and the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the simulations presented here use adaptive mesh refinement with six refinement levels ; the finest grid covers completely each of the nss during the inspiral and merger , while the coarsest grid extends up to @xmath26 .",
    "our fiducial runs have a resolution of @xmath27 on the finest grid , but convergence tests have been performed using both a coarser ( @xmath28 ) and a finer resolution ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the initial data were produced using the publicly available code lorene  @xcite .",
    "the initial solutions for the binaries were obtained assuming a quasi - circular orbit , an irrotational fluid - velocity field , and a conformally - flat spatial metric .",
    "the matter is modeled using a polytropic eos @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the pressure , @xmath32 the rest - mass density , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , in which case the maximum gravitational mass is @xmath35 for a non - rotating ns , and @xmath36 for a uniformly maximally - rotating star , in agreement with recent observations of ns masses  @xcite .",
    "an ideal - fluid eos with @xmath34 is used during the evolution in order to allow for shock heating during merger .",
    "this eos has been chosen since it fits very well the shen nuclear eos  @xcite at high densities  @xcite , and hence it provides a more accurate description of the evolution of the plasma in the high - density regions than the simpler @xmath37 polytrope used in our previous simulations  @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider an equal - mass system both with and without a magnetic field , and with a total gravitational mass @xmath38 . when a magnetic field is present , its initial configuration is purely poloidal and aligned with the angular momentum of the binary as in  @xcite .",
    "details about the initial configurations are provided in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "we first evolved the unmagnetized case ( model b0 ) with three different resolutions : @xmath39 ( low ) , @xmath40 ( medium ) , and @xmath41 ( high ) . in all cases , the binary inspirals for five orbits before merging .",
    "the main aspects of the dynamics are illustrated in figure  [ figure1 ] , where we show the rest - mass density on the equatorial plane for the high resolution case .",
    "one important point to note is that , as observed in previous simulations of bns mergers , the compact object that is formed after the inspiral is differentially rotating .",
    "however , while in previous simulations it was an hmns , in the current simulations the ns is well below that limit ( @xmath36 for our eos ) , and hence it does not collapse to bh . at the end of our simulation ,",
    "the differentially - rotating ns has a mass @xmath42 and is surrounded by a disk of @xmath3 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     other numerical simulations of magnetized hmnss have further demonstrated the possibility of producing outflows with energy of @xmath43 for magnetic fields of @xmath44  @xcite . as already discussed before ,",
    "such magnetic fields can be naturally formed in our scenario via kh and mri instabilities . according to  @xcite",
    ", a magnetic field of @xmath45 could give rise to an electromagnetic emission observable in the radio band and hence provide an interesting electromagnetic counterpart to the gw signal even if a sgrb is not observed .",
    "we have presented the first general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations that show the possible formation of a stable magnetar .",
    "the ns formed after the merger is found to be differentially rotating and ultraspinning . since our computational resources are not enough to fully resolve the mri , the magnetic field is amplified by about two orders of magnitude , but further amplification is possible and indeed observed in two and three - dimensional simulations of differentially rotating nss  @xcite . moreover",
    ", long term evolution of such models has shown that the magnetic field can impact the angular velocity profile of the ns leading to the formation of an uniformly rotating ns surrounded by an accretion disk and with a collimated magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "while it will be difficult to differentiate the gw signal between the magnetized and the unmagnetized scenarios , strong electromagnetic counterparts that would be suppressed in collapsing nss could be easily produced and observed in radio  @xcite , optical  @xcite , x - rays  @xcite , and gamma - rays  @xcite .    while our simulations focused on equal - mass systems , the same scenario may be produced after the merger of unequal - mass bnss . in this case ,",
    "matter ejected during the inspiral due to the tidal disruption of the less massive components , may later fall back on the magnetar and trigger its collapse to bh  @xcite .",
    "more detailed observations of the early afterglow phase , as expected with the planned future mission _ loft _  @xcite , will be especially useful in discriminating among various formation scenarios .",
    "last , simultaneous detections of gws and sgrbs will fully unveil the mechanism behind the central engine and help constrain its properties  @xcite .",
