    "is it possible for the pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles to be explained in a qualitative and quantitative way by a suitable extension of the symmetries of the standard model ? despite great effort , the answer to this fundamental question remains elusive . in this paper",
    "we explore the combined consequences of vertical grand unified symmetries , which lead to the successful prediction of gauge coupling unification  @xcite , and horizontal flavor symmetries , which act on the three unified generations .",
    "the measured values of the bottom quark and the @xmath7 lepton masses are compatible with their equality at a unification scale  @xcite , establishing a nice consistency with the heaviness of the top quark in the case of a supersymmetric theory  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the interpretation of the light masses and of the mixing angles constitutes a formidable challenge .",
    "several relations have been noticed in the past , sometimes justified on a theoretical basis , like , e.g. , @xmath8",
    "@xcite , @xmath9 and @xmath10  @xcite , or @xmath11",
    "@xcite , involving the masses and the ckm matrix elements renormalized at the unification scale . apparently missing",
    ", however , is a coherent overall picture based on a minimum number of assumptions and capable of experimental predictions . ref .",
    "@xcite is an attempt in this direction .",
    "we seek grand unified and flavor symmetries acting on the three generations , @xmath12 , and spontaneously broken by a set of fields @xmath13 , so that the yukawa interactions can be built up as an expansion in @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the cutoff of an effective theory :    @xmath16_f \\label{fermass}\\ ] ]    and @xmath17 contains the higgs doublets .",
    "this expansion should yield the observed hierarchical structure of the fermion masses and mixings , hence the leading term in ( [ fermass ] ) should not give masses to the lighter generations nor should it give rise to quark mixing . the structure of ( [ fermass ] ) should be sufficiently constrained so that there are few relevant parameters and a quantitative fit to the data should lead to predictions for quantities that can be measured .      in supersymmetric theories",
    "there are mass and interaction matrices for the squarks and sleptons , leading to a rich flavor structure .",
    "in particular , if fermions and scalars of a given charge have mass matrices which are not diagonalized by the same rotation , new mixing matrices , @xmath18 , occur at gaugino vertices .",
    "the squark and slepton mass matrices will be constrained by the grand unified and flavor symmetries and arise dominantly from    @xmath19_d . \\label{scalmass}\\ ] ]    where a superfield notation has been used and @xmath20 is a supersymmetry breaking spurion , taken dimensionless , with @xmath21 .",
    "equation ( [ fermass ] ) must contain a large interaction which generates the large top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "since ( [ fermass ] ) and ( [ scalmass ] ) are governed by the same symmetries , it follows that at least some of the scalars of the third generation are likely to have masses very different from their first and second generation partners : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the average scalar mass squared  @xcite . such a mass splitting does not lead to excessive flavor - changing effects provided the new mixing matrices have elements involving the third generation which are no greater than those of the ckm matrix , @xmath24 : @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27  @xcite . if the approximate equality holds , then there are contributions to flavor - changing processes which are interesting  we call this the  1,23 \" signal  @xcite",
    ".    on the contrary , in general there should be considerable degeneracy between the scalars of the first two generations : @xmath28 .",
    "for cabibbo - like mixing for @xmath29 , the observed cp violation in the @xmath30 system requires  @xcite    @xmath31    in the charge @xmath32 sector , where @xmath13 is the relevant cp violating phase . in the lepton sector , the corresponding limit from @xmath33 and @xmath34 conversion is @xmath35 @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "these constraints we refer to as the  12 \" problem  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the flavor symmetry should yield mixing of the third generation with the lighter two which is at most ckm - like , giving a possible  1,23 \" signal , while in the light sector it should yield small fermion masses and small scalar mass splittings , solving the  12 \" problem .",
    "we find that all these features are satisfied by a u(2 ) flavor symmetry in which the lighter two generations transform as a doublet and the third generation as a trivial singlet : @xmath37 , providing the symmetry breaking parameter is governed by @xmath38 . @xcite . ]",
    "in a grand unified theory , for example based on the group so(10 ) , the maximal flavor group is u(3 ) , with the three generations transforming as a triplet .",
    "this flavor group will be strongly broken by the large top yukawa coupling to u(2 ) , which is the flavor group studied in this paper .",
    "the three generations @xmath12 are taken to transform as @xmath39 , @xmath40 taking the higgs bosons to be flavor singlets , the yukawa interactions transform as : @xmath41 we assume that the quark and lepton mass matrices can be adequately described by terms in ( 1 ) up to linear order in the fields @xmath42 , `` flavons '' , non trivial under u(2 ) .",
    "hence the only relevant u(2 ) representations for the fermion mass matrices are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are symmetric and antisymmetric tensors , and the upper indices denote a u(1 ) charge opposite to that of @xmath49 .",
    "the transformation properties of these fields under the unified gauge group is discussed in the next section .",
    "the observed hierarchy of fermion masses of the three generations leads us to a flavor symmetry breaking pattern @xmath50 so that the generation mass hierarhies @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be understood in terms of the two symmetry breaking parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "fermion masses linear in @xmath53 can arise only from : @xmath55 and @xmath56 , giving yukawa matrices of the form @xmath57 in the heavy @xmath58 space .",
    "the breaking @xmath59 is necessary to describe @xmath60 , while @xmath61 is necessary if u(2 ) alone is to solve a possible  1,23 \" flavor - changing problem . in theories without @xmath61 ,",
    "the symmetry breaking parameter @xmath53 is of order @xmath62 to account for the strange quark mass .",
    "this leads to excessive contributions to @xmath63 , unless the mass splitting @xmath64 is taken to be considerably less than @xmath23 , as in  @xcite . on the contrary , the u(2 ) symmetry breaking parameter @xmath65",
    "the constraint of ( [ epsilon ] ) is just satisfied : the  12 \" problem has become an interesting  12 \" signature .    in principle",
    "there are a variety of options for the last stage of symmetry breaking in ( [ u2br ] ) .",
    "we assume    * the theory contains one of each of the fields @xmath66 and @xmath46 .",
    "* the non zero vevs of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 each participate in only one stage of the symmetry breaking in  ( [ u2br ] ) .    in the basis where @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 and all other components of @xmath47 vanish",
    "if they were non - zero they would break u(1 ) at order @xmath53 , which is excluded by ( [ u2br ] ) .",
    "hence , these assumptions imply that the last stage of the flavor symmetry breaking of ( [ u2br ] ) must be accomplished by @xmath70 of order @xmath54 .",
    "to linear order in @xmath71 , the symmetry breaking pattern ( [ u2br ] ) leads to yukawa matrices in up , down and charged lepton sectors of the form : @xmath72 such a pattern agrees qualitatively well with the observed quark and lepton masses and mixings , with three exceptions :    * @xmath73 . +",
    "this may not be a puzzle .",
    "it could result as a consequence of @xmath74 , the light higgs which couples to the @xmath75 sectors , having a small , order @xmath76 , component of the higgs doublet in the unified multiplet @xmath17 .",
    "such higgs mixing could be understood in terms of symmetry breaking in the higgs sector , and would reduce the yukawa matrices @xmath77 by a small factor , @xmath78 , relative to the yukawa matrix @xmath79 . * @xmath80 .",
    "* @xmath81 .",
    "neither the u(2 ) symmetry nor higgs mixing appears to give a fermion mass hierarchy which is larger in the @xmath82 sector than in the @xmath75 sectors .",
    "hence the central question which this u(2 ) framework must address is _ why do @xmath83 and @xmath84 vanish at order @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively ? _",
    "the central issue of why @xmath83 and @xmath84 vanish at order @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , can be answered using su(5 ) , which is contained in all grand unified symmetry groups . to linear order in the @xmath14 , the expansion ( 1 ) in the case of su(5)@xmath86u(2 ) has the form @xmath87",
    "@xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are @xmath92 and @xmath93 representations of matter and @xmath17 and @xmath94 are @xmath95 and @xmath93 representations of higgs , necessary for acceptable third generation masses . in general the @xmath96 and @xmath48 multiplets can transform as any su(5 ) representation with zero fivality and containing one , or more , sm singlets . the interactions of ( [ su5a ] ) , ( [ su5b ] ) and ( [ su5c ] ) are understood to include all possible su(5 ) invariants .",
    "the second operator of ( [ su5a ] ) leads to the well - known su(5 ) mass relation @xcite @xmath97 at the unification scale .",
    "the couplings @xmath85 arise from the @xmath98 terms of ( [ su5c ] ) , while the couplings @xmath99 arise from the @xmath100 terms .",
    "these terms are distinguished because @xmath101 possesses a definite symmetry , @xmath102 for components containing a higgs doublet , while @xmath103 does not .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath85 at order @xmath104 is immediate if the su(5 ) representations of @xmath47 and @xmath48 are such that @xmath105 and @xmath106 do not transform as @xmath95 and @xmath107 respectively .",
    "for example , since @xmath108 is antisymmetric in flavor , it couples to @xmath98 only if it is conjugate to the antisymmetric product of @xmath109 , which is a @xmath110 . for @xmath99 to be non - zero at order @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 must transform as @xmath107 and @xmath95 , or the multiplets @xmath111 must transform as * 75 * , * 1 * respectively .",
    "this implies that @xmath112 arise from @xmath113 , leading to the georgi - jarlskog  @xcite mass relation @xmath114 at the unification scale .",
    "similarly , @xmath115 arise from @xmath116 , leading to the highly successful determinantal mass relation @xmath117 at the unification scale . in any grand unified theory where the flavor symmetry u(2 ) completely solves the supersymmetric flavor - changing problem , su(5 ) provides a symmetry understanding for the vanishing of @xmath85 at order @xmath104 , and leads to the georgi - jarlskog relation ( [ gj ] ) and the determinantal relation ( [ det ] ) as direct , necessary consequences .",
    "the su(5 ) theory of the previous subsection , described by ( [ su5a ] ) , ( [ su5b ] ) and ( [ su5c ] ) , qualitatively accounts for all fermion masses and mixings , with the exception that @xmath118 , which is a consequence of the su(5 ) and flavor symmetries leading to @xmath119 . for @xmath120 to be non - zero at higher order in @xmath14 , additional fields @xmath13 must be added .",
    "we choose to do this by introducing a field @xmath121 which is a trivial flavor singlet and an su(5 ) @xmath122 .",
    "the subscript @xmath123 is then to recall that the vev @xmath124 has to break su(5 ) , so that it points in the hypercharge direction @xmath123 .",

    "these yukawa matrices lead to the qualitative results shown in tables  [ tab : qualitative1 ] and  [ tab : qualitative2 ] .",
    "since @xmath143 and @xmath144 , the cutoff scale , @xmath15 , is 3050 times larger than the unification scale , at which su(5 ) breaks and u(2 ) is broken to u(1 ) .",
    "the scale of flavor u(1 ) symmetry breaking is about an order of magnitude beneath the unification scale .",

    "the final two precise relations are those of ( [ 12d ] ) and ( [ 12u ] ) .",
    "these follow purely from the zero entries of ( [ su5yuku ] ) and ( [ su5yukd ] ) , together with the antisymmetry of the 12 entries , and an approximate perturbative diagonalization of the yukawa matrices . the zeros and antisymmetry of the 12 entries are upset by higher dimension operators only if additional u(2 ) breaking fields are present .",
    "the approximate diagonalization means that these relations are corrected at order @xmath53 and @xmath151 respectively .",
    "the unified u(2 ) scheme described above provides a simple symmetry framework leading to the patterns of tables  [ tab : qualitative1 ] and  [ tab : qualitative2 ] , and requiring the 5 precise relations of ( [ b / tau ] ) , ( [ gj ] ) , ( [ det ] ) , ( [ 12d ] ) and ( [ 12u ] ) .",
    "in this section we have used su(5 ) as the unified symmetry , as it is sufficient to reach our conclusions ; this su(5 ) theory may be embedded in a unified u(2 ) theory with larger gauge group .",

    "however , there is a combination of these quantities which has been determined , using second order chiral perturbation theory for the pseudoscalar meson masses , to 3.5% accuracy @xmath153 with a possible ambiguity related to an experimental discrepancy concerning the @xmath154 decay  @xcite .",
    "we find this value for @xmath152 conflicts with the precise relations of the previous subsection . combining ( [ gj ] ) and ( [ det ] ) leads to a determination of @xmath155 implying that @xmath152 is larger than 25 by an amount that depends on @xmath156 . using ( [ b / tau ] ) , ( [ det ] ) , ( [ 12u ] ) , but not ( [ gj ] ) , one finds @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 are renormalization factors discussed in section  [ sec : model ] , and have been evaluated for @xmath160 , and we have used the running masses @xmath161 gev and @xmath162 gev .",
    "the experimental value for @xmath163 ensures that @xmath156 can not be too small in the u(2 ) framework , thus making the prediction for @xmath152 even larger .",
    "how should this @xmath152 problem , which is a feature of many textures , be overcome in the u(2 ) framework ? we have argued that the precise relations receive corrections at most of order @xmath164 , and yet the conflict between ( [ q ] ) and ( [ s / d],[vub ] ) requires that ( [ s / d ] ) be modified by 20% .",
    "we believe that the most probably resolution of this puzzle is the order @xmath53 terms in the 23 and 32 entries of the @xmath147 and @xmath134 yukawa matrices .",
    "suppose they have a size @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is a number of order unity .",
    "the 23 diagonalization then leads to corrections of the georgi - jarlskog relation ( [ gj ] ) which can be about @xmath167 . in combining ( [ gj ] ) and ( [ det ] ) to obtain the relation ( [ s / d ] ) for @xmath168 , one must square ( [ gj ] ) , hence the corrections to ( [ s / d ] ) are of order @xmath169 , so that @xmath170 is quite sufficient to resolve the discrepancy .",
    "we shall come back to this point in section  [ sec : correcting ] .",
    "the rest of this paper concerns unified theories based on the gauge group so(10 ) .",

    "this is not significant because the effect of the reduction is negated by higgs mixing : for the third generation , the interaction ( [ so10a ] ) together with higgs mixing , leads only to the relation @xmath180 , as in su(5 ) .",

    "an interesting feature of this model is that the fit to the data shows that the three independent physical phases which enter the yukawa matrices are constrained to be close to multiples of @xmath396 , suggesting a spontaneous origin for cp violation via the vevs which break the flavor and grand unified symmetries . in this case , the yukawa matrices depend on just 7 parameters , and a fit to data produces precise predictions for @xmath397 , @xmath393 and @xmath275 .",
    "the scalar mass matrices of this model are more restricted than in the general unified u(2 ) theories , allowing a calculation of the mixing matrices at gaugino vertices .",
    "the resulting predictions for the supersymmetric contributions to flavor and cp violating observables will be reported elsewhere .",
