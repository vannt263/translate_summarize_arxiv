    ", we combine these items with recent efforts aiming at the physical realization of quantum bits , the controllable quantum two - level systems which are the basic elements of a quantum computer @xcite ; by now , a number of devices have been realized in the laboratory , among them particular solid - state implementations such as flux- @xcite or charge- @xcite qubits which are easy to couple to .",
    "the purpose of this letter is three - fold : i ) to draw attention to the equivalence between the fidelity of a quantum system and the generating function for the full counting statistics , two quantities which have been conceived to be unrelated so far .",

    "the semi - classical states @xmath5 carry circulating currents perturbing the wire in the measurement of the fidelity ; in the measurement of the full counting statistics the state of the qubit is incrementally changed at each passage of a charge through the wire .",
    ", width=302 ]    in this context , there are two points of view in describing a system ( such as a regular or chaotic dot , a quantum wire , etc . ) coupled to a qubit : i ) the qubit - centered view , where the dot / wire acts as a noisy environment producing decoherence of the qubit state @xcite  this traditional view is pursued in the field of quantum computing ; ii ) the dot / wire - centered view , where the qubit serves as a measurement device providing information on the system ( the dot or wire ) .",
    "this is the new standpoint we take in the present paper where we are interested in two system properties , the fidelity and the full counting statistics .",
    "the notion of _ fidelity _ has been introduced in order to quantify the stability of a quantum system ( described by the hamiltonian @xmath6 ) under the action of a small external perturbation @xmath7 @xcite : evaluating the evolution of an initial state @xmath8 under the action of the system s hamiltonian @xmath6 , @xmath9 , comparison is made with the perturbed evolution @xmath10\\psi$ ] through the matrix element @xcite @xmath11 a quantum system with a chaotic classical correspondent exhibits a rapid time - decay of the fidelity @xmath12 @xcite , while a regular classical analogue leads to its saturation at a finite value @xcite . above , the fidelity has been defined for a pure state formulated in a first - quantization language ; the definition ( [ chi_fid ] ) agrees with its quantum information theoretic analogue for two pure state @xmath8 and @xmath13 @xcite .    in general , the interference between two wave functions as manifested in ( [ chi_fid ] ) is difficult to measure . here",
    ", we put forward the idea to couple the system under investigation to an external device ( e.g. , a two - level system in the form of a spin or a qubit ) which simultaneously acts as a perturbation and as a measuring device for the fidelity , see fig .  [",
    "fig : qubit](a ) : the coupling @xmath14 entangles the system with the measurement device , thus transferring information of the system s evolution which then can be measured along with the quantum state of the device .",
    "a similar idea has been introduced in the context of the _ full counting statistics _ ( fcs ) which is characterizing the charge transport through a quantum wire .",
    "the task then is to count the number of transferred charges which corresponds to the measurement of the integrated current @xmath15 .",

    "the idea to couple the system to a measurement device resolves these problems : following the work of levitov and lesovik @xcite , the complete statistical information can be obtained by coupling the wire to a spin degree of freedom serving as the measuring device ; the fourier coefficients @xmath17 of the generating function @xmath18     \\label{chi_fcs}\\ ] ] provide the probabilities @xmath19 for the passage of @xmath20 charges during the time @xmath21 . here , @xmath22",

    "the full counting statistics refers to a many - body system cast in a second - quantized formalism . still , comparing ( [ chi_fid ] ) and ( [ chi_fcs ] )",
    ", we immediately note the similarity of the two expressions : indeed , replacing the arbitrary perturbation in ( [ chi_fid ] ) by the coupling to a spin ( or two - level system ) serving at the same time as a perturbation _ and _ as a measurement device , we arrive at the form in ( [ chi_fcs ] ) with the trace over the wire s degrees of freedom replaced by the quantum average over the initial state @xmath8 . in previous discussions @xcite the fidelity of a quantum system",
    "has been related to the chaotic / regular nature of the system ; probing such a system with a measurement device as described above provides the identical information .",
    "the notion of fidelity introduced here generalizes this concept to quantum systems without classical analogue as well as mixed state- and many - particle systems ; the quantum information theoretic definition for density matrices @xcite is different , however .",
    "the fidelity / generating function @xmath24 is obtained by coupling a spin ( in zero external magnetic field ) to the system via a hamiltonian of the form @xmath25 ( the absence of terms @xmath26 is crucial ) .",
    "the evolution of the spin then is described by the reduced density matrix @xmath27     \\label{rho_qubit}\\ ] ] with the initial separable density matrix @xmath28 and the trace is taken over the system degrees of freedom without the spin ; for the fidelity ( [ chi_fid ] ) we have to replace @xmath29 .",

    "below , we will replace the spin degree of freedom by the more versatile qubit .",
    "thereby , we transfer the measurement of the fidelity and of the full counting statistics from the realm of a ` gedanken ' experiment to a practical proposal realizable with today s qubit technology . in this context , we recognize previous steps taken in this direction in measuring the fidelity of a quantum kicked rotator @xcite and in the measurement of higher order correlators @xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite for alternative theoretical proposals .",
    "on a technical level , our problem is described by the hamiltonian ( we formulate the problem for a wire ; the extension to other systems is straightforward ) @xmath32 with @xmath22 the wire s hamiltonian of which the fidelity and/or full counting statistics shall be determined , @xmath33 is the qubit hamiltonian written in the semi - classical basis @xmath5 ( see fig .  [",

    "the qubit is prepared in the ground state @xmath2 at optimal frustration ( point o in fig .",
    "[ fig : qubit](b ) with @xmath54 and @xmath55 ; this corresponds to the spin - state polarized along the @xmath56-axis ) and then is suddenly switched ( at time @xmath57 ) to the measuring point m which has to be chosen sufficiently far away from o to avoid mixing of the semi - classical states ( i.e. , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , hence the hamiltonian ( [ hamqub ] ) describes a spin in a magnetic field directed along the @xmath1-axis ) .",
    "on the other hand , the point m should be chosen not too distant away from o in order to avoid the mixing with other levels . at the end of the signal accumulation ( i.e. , at time @xmath21 ) the state of the qubit has to be measured in the following manner : rotation of the qubit state by @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) around the @xmath62- ( @xmath56- ) axis and subsequent measurement along the @xmath1-axis provides us with the matrix elements @xmath63 $ ] ( @xmath64 $ ] ) from which the _ final result _ @xmath65 $ ] follows ( the phase @xmath66 compensates the trivial time evolution of the qubit in the finite residual field ) .    in order to extract the full counting statistics from the generating function @xmath67 , a tunable coupling between the wire and the qubit is needed .",
    "the tetrahedral superconducting qubit proposed recently @xcite lends itself as a particularly useful measurement device : its doubly degenerate ground state emulates a spin in zero magnetic field , hence @xmath68 , while a symmetric charge bias @xmath69 produces an interaction hamiltonian @xmath70 which is linear in the magnetic flux @xmath71 ( produced by the wire s current ) threading the qubit and easily tunable with @xmath72 ( note that imposing a flux @xmath71 the tetrahedral qubit also serves as a _ tunable _ charge detector ) . alternatively",
    ", flux- @xcite or charge- @xcite qubits can be used with a flux tunable third junction or an electrically tunable capacitance .",
    "finally , we have to make sure that the individual electrons passing through the wire are sufficiently coupled to the qubit .",
    "this is trivially the case for the electric coupling , where a simple calculation leads to the estimate @xmath73 with @xmath74 the fermi velocity , @xmath75 the wire s length , and @xmath76 its distance from the qubit ; with @xmath77 of order @xmath78 or larger a @xmath38-value beyond unity is easily realized .",
    "the situation is less favorable for the case of magnetic coupling : associating the qubit with a magnetic dipole @xmath79 ( @xmath80 denotes the qubit s area ) , we obtain a coupling @xmath81 , @xmath82 the finestructure constant . with @xmath83 of order @xmath84a and @xmath85 m , we find a coupling @xmath86 .",
    "similar findings apply to the tetrahedral qubit : applying a homogeneous flux @xmath87 , the qubit can be used as a tunable charge detector with large coupling @xmath88 , @xmath89 denoting the capacitive coupling between the wire and the qubit . on the other hand , applying a symmetric charge bias @xmath90 we find a magnetic coupling of order @xmath91 ( we have chosen a typical parameter @xmath92 ) . as may be expected ,",
    "the system is easily coupled to the qubit via electric interaction , while its magnetic coupling is generically weak and has to be suitably enhanced , e.g. , with the help of a flux transformer .",
    "the _ magnetic _ coupling of the flux qubit allows for the measurement of both the full counting statistics and the system s fidelity .",
    "going over to the interaction representation ( with the unperturbed hamiltonian given by the system hamiltonian ) , the generating function assumes the form ( cf .",
    "( [ rho_qubit_ev ] ) ) @xmath93 ,     \\label{chi_int_rep}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) denote the ( reverse ) time ordering operators ; as desired , the magnetic coupling then is proportional to the integrated current ( or transferred charge ) @xmath96 ; the form ( [ chi_int_rep ] ) reveals the role of @xmath67 as the generating function for the cumulants of transferred charge .",
    "alternatively , the qubit can be viewed as a system perturbation and @xmath97 assumes the role of a fidelity @xmath12 .",
    "the _ electric _ coupling to the charge qubit generates a quantity @xmath98 whose meaning is predominantly that of a fidelity ; on the other hand , for a uniform and unidirectional charge motion with velocity @xmath74 , the time - integrated charge @xmath99 can be related to the transferred charge @xmath100 via @xmath101 and thus provides an approximate access to the full counting statistics at finite voltage for which the electrons move in a specific direction along the wire .",
    "inspired by the equivalence between the fidelity and the generating function for the counting statistics , we proceed with the calculation of @xmath24 within a first - quantized formalism .",
    "in particular , we choose a system in the geometry of a point contact and study the fidelity for the case where a wave packet is incident on the scatterer .",
    "this scheme allows for a more elaborate discussion of the various parametric dependencies of the fidelity / fcs but suffers from the restriction to a single particle . in order to ameliorate this limitation ,",
    "we extend the discussion to a sequence of two incident wave packets , from which the extrapolation to the many body case can be performed .",
    "consider a wave packet ( for @xmath102 and traveling to the right ) @xmath103 centered around @xmath104 with @xmath105 and normalization @xmath106 , incident on a scatterer characterized by transmission and reflection amplitudes @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we place the qubit behind the scatterer to have it interact with the transmitted part of the wave function .",
    "the transmitted wave packet then acquires an additional phase due to the interaction with the qubit : for a magnetic interaction the extra phase accumulated up to the position @xmath56 amounts to @xmath109 , independent of @xmath110 ; as @xmath111 this adds up to a total phase @xmath112 , cf .",
    "( [ hamint_t ] ) . for an electric interaction , cf .",
    "( [ hamint_l ] ) , the situation is slightly more involved : the extra phase can be easily determined for a slowly varying ( quasi - classical ) potential of small magnitude , i.e. , @xmath113 .",
    "expanding the quasi - classical phase @xmath114 with @xmath115 to first order in the potential @xmath116 yields the phase @xmath117 which asymptotically accumulates to the value @xmath118 ; its @xmath49-dependence is due to the particle s acceleration in the scalar potential and will be discussed in more detail below . moreover , note that @xmath119 changes sign for a particle moving in the opposite direction ( @xmath120 ) ( i.e. , under time reversal ) whereas @xmath121 does not . for a qubit placed behind the scatterer both magnetic and electric couplings produce equivalent phase shifts .",
    "depending on the state @xmath5 of the qubit , the outgoing wave ( for @xmath122 ) @xmath123     \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] acquires a different asymptotic phase on its transmitted part .",
    "the fidelity is given by the overlap of the two outgoing waves , @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 denote the probabilities for reflection and transmission , respectively , and we have neglected exponentially small off - diagonal terms involving products @xmath127 .",
    "the result ( [ fid_behind ] ) applies to both magnetic and electric couplings ; its interpretation as the generating function of the charge counting statistics provides us with the two non - zero fourier coefficients @xmath128 and @xmath129 which are simply the probabilities for reflection and transmission of the particle .",
    "this result agrees with the usual notion of ` counting ' those particles which have passed the qubit behind the scatterer .",
    "when , instead , the interest is in the system s sensitivity , we observe that the fidelity @xmath24 lies on the unit circle only for the ` trivial ' cases of zero or full transmission @xmath130 , i.e. , in the absence of partitioning , or for @xmath131 ; the latter condition corresponds to no counting or the periodic vanishing of decoherence in the qubit . on the contrary , in the case of",
    "maximal partitioning with @xmath132 , a simple phase shift by @xmath133 makes the fidelity vanish altogether .",
    "hence , partitioning has to be considered as a ( purely quantum ) source of sensitivity towards small changes , as chaoticity generates sensitivity in a quantum system with a classical analogue .",
    "the result ( [ fid_behind ] ) also applies for a qubit placed in front of the scattering region provided the coupling is of magnetic nature ( for the reflected wave , the additional phases picked up in the interaction region cancel , while the phase in the transmitted part remains uncompensated )",
    ". however , an electric coupling behaves differently under time reversal and the fidelity acquires the new form @xmath134 next , we comment on the ( velocity ) dispersion in the electric coupling @xmath38 : the different components in the wave packet then acquire different phases . to make this point more explicit consider a gaussian wave packet centered around @xmath135 with a small spreading @xmath136 and denote with @xmath137 the phase associated with the @xmath135 mode .",
    "the spreading @xmath138 in @xmath110 generates a corresponding spreading in @xmath139 which leads to a reduced fidelity @xmath140 where we have assumed a smooth dependence of @xmath141 over @xmath138 in the last equation .",
    "the reduced fidelity for @xmath142 is due to the acceleration and deceleration produced by the two states of the qubit @xcite .",
    "the wave packets passing the qubit then acquire a different time delay depending on the qubit s state . as a result ,",
    "the wave packets become separated in space with an exponentially small residual overlap for the gaussian shaped packets .",
    "next , we consider the case with two wave packets incident on the scatterer , @xmath143\\chi_{s / t}(s_1,s_2)$ ] , where @xmath144 denote different wave packet amplitudes , cf .",
    "( [ psi_in ] ) , and @xmath145 are the singlet / triplet spin functions .",
    "placing the qubit behind the scatterer , we obtain the fidelity @xmath146 ,     \\label{fid2_behind}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the normalization @xmath147 , @xmath148 @xmath149 , and we have made use of the fact that all components of the wave packet propagate in specific directions such that @xmath150 .",
    "the fidelity ( [ fid2_behind ] ) involves two terms , a direct term independent of the spin / orbital symmetry and an exchange term that can be neglected if the two wave packets are well separated either in momentum space ( with @xmath151 sufficiently different ) or in real space ( with @xmath152 ) . in both of these cases the overlap @xmath80 vanishes and we arrive at the final result @xmath153     [ \\langle r\\rangle_{f_2 } + e^{i \\lambda } \\langle t\\rangle_{f_2 } ] ,     \\label{fid2_final}\\ ] ]",
    "i.e. , the fidelity of the two - particle system is just the product of the single particle fidelities",
    ". the result can be trivially generalized to the many particle case provided that exchange terms can be neglected , as is the case for a sequence of ( @xmath154 ) properly separated wave packets .",
    "the result @xmath155 $ ] then has to be compared with the previous finding @xmath156^{e|v|t / h}$ ] @xcite calculated at constant voltage @xmath157 within a many - body formalism . the validity of the latter result is restricted to non - dispersive scattering coefficients @xmath158 and @xmath159 . identifying @xmath160 with the number @xmath154 of transmitted particles the two results agree .",
    "however , we note that the present derivation corresponds to a voltage driven many - body setup where distinct voltage pulses with unit flux @xmath161 , each transferring one particle , are applied to the system @xcite .",
    "the detailed comparison of these two cases , pulsed versus constant voltage , and the absence of interference terms in the latter case is an interesting problem for further investigation .",
    "the extension of the fidelity to the many - body case puts additional emphasis on the _ relation between sensitivity and partitioning _ ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) as any finite partitioning with @xmath162 now generates a fidelity which is vanishing exponentially in time ; the quantity @xmath163/\\delta t$ ] with @xmath164 the time separation between two wave packets / voltage pulses then plays the role of the lyapunov exponent in systems with a classical chaotic correspondent .    in summary",
    ", we have unified the themes of fidelity and full counting statistics and have shown how to exploit qubits for their measurement . as an application of these ideas , we have recalculated the generating function for the full counting statistics within a wave packet approach .",
    "this allows for a more in - depth analysis of the counting problem and helps to shed light on the ongoing discussion @xcite relating different expressions for high - order correlators to variations in the experimental setup .",
