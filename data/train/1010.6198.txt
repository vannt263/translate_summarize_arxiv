    "the launch of the x - ray timing satellite , _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) , led to the discovery of kilohertz quasi periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in their x - ray lightcurves .",
    "the frequencies of khz qpos range from a few hundreds to about one thousand hz ; its time - scale corresponds to the dynamical time of the innermost regions of the accretion flow .",
    "thus such signals may carry crucial information about the central neutron star ( ns ) , such as the mass , spin frequency , angular momentum , radius , magnetic fields and so on .",
    "usually the twin khz qpos appear simultaneously and the lower and upper qpos are almost directly proportional with each other ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "various theoretical models have been proposed to account for the khz qpo signals .",
    "table [ tb : models ] shows all the present models we collect .",
    "although each model achieves its success to a certain extent , the origin of khz qpos is still highly debated .",
    "furthermore many new models emerge in recent years , and systematic comparisons among them have not been well studied ."

    "<S> by fitting the frequencies of simultaneous lower and upper kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) in two prototype neutron star qpo sources ( 4u  1636 - 536 and sco x-1 ) , we test the predictive power of all currently proposed qpo models . </S>",
    "<S> models predict either a linear , power - law or any other relationship between the two frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> we found that for plausible neutron star parameters ( mass and angular momentum ) , no model can satisfactorily reproduce the data , leading to very large chi - squared values in our fittings . </S>",
    "<S> both for 4u  1636 - 53 and sco x-1 , this is largely due to the fact that the data significantly differ from a linear relationship . </S>",
    "<S> some models perform relatively better but still have their own problems . </S>",
    "<S> such a detailed comparison of data with models shall enable to identify routes for improving those models further . </S>"
