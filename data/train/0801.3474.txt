    "according to classical theories of polymer physics , flexible chains in solution assume coiled conformations . as the polymer concentration , or contour length",
    "is increased , these coils overlap and produce entanglement effects , which include a pronounced retardation of molecular mobility . for linear polymers ( lp ) , this transition from unentangled to entangled dynamics is marked by a change in the zero - shear viscosity @xmath0 from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , and self - diffusivity @xmath3 from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the molecular weight .",
    "molecular topology has a strong effect on the dynamics of polymers in the entangled state , and constitutes a subject of fundamental and industrial interest in polymer physics and rheology .",
    "although important gaps in understanding persist , the behavior of entangled linear and branched polymers , such as stars , are relatively well - described at small deformation rates , using the tube ansatz . here , the molecular dynamics of a tracer chain enmeshed in a matrix of other molecules , are formulated in terms of a diffusion problem that describes the motion of _ chain ends _ in a hypothetical tube @xcite .",
    "concentrated solutions of ring or cyclic polymers ( cp ) , which lack chain ends , are scientifically intriguing , since they defy a simple description in terms of the tube model .",
    "while interest in cps has recently been rekindled , the conformational and dynamic properties of cps in gels and in melts have been studied theoretically @xcite , computationally @xcite , and experimentally @xcite since the 1980s .",
    "almost all the theoretical and computational studies have investigated the characteristics of pure cps and lps , while blends of cps and lps have escaped the same level of scrutiny @xcite .",
    "these blend systems are important for two reasons : ( i ) most experimental data on pure cps are , in fact , data on cyclic - linear blends ( clb ) , due to contamination or limitations of purification methods , and ( ii ) the dynamics of such clbs , are extraordinarily sensitive to the concentration of lps , as demonstrated by the linear viscoelastic response of polystyrene clbs @xcite , and self - diffusion studies of dna solutions @xcite .",
    "these studies indicate a dramatic change in the mobilty of cps that is , both , unexpected and unexplained , and might supply deep insights into entangled polymer dynamics .    in this letter , a lattice - based dynamic monte carlo method called the bond - fluctuation model ( bfm ) is used to monitor the trajectory of lps and cps in entangled clbs .",
    "a minimal model is constructed , to interpret the diffusivities obtained from the simulation .",
    "this approximate theory is able to reasonably explain recent experimental data on entangled dna solutions .",
    "we use shaffer s version of the bfm , @xcite which has recently been applied to blends of cps and lps @xcite .",
    "since the model has been described in detail previously , only a brief summary presented here . monomers or beads are placed on a simple cubic lattice . to generate an equilibrated clb , we insert @xmath7 non - concatenated cps and @xmath8 lps , each consisting of @xmath9 monomers , on a 3d cubic lattice in a simulation box of size @xmath10 . to simulate melt - like behavior ,",
    "the total fractional occupancy of the lattice is maintained at @xmath11 , where @xmath12 represents the fractional occupancy of cps ( @xmath13 ) and lps ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "a trial move is attempted by displacing a randomly selected bead , belonging to either a cp or lp , by one lattice unit .",
    "it is accepted if it does not violate the excluded volume , chain connectivity and chain uncrossability constraints .",
    "one monte carlo step ( mcs ) consists of ( @xmath15 trial moves . throughout this letter",

    "to estimate the diffusion constants we performed linear regression analysis on the mean - squared displacement @xmath26 in the interval @xmath27 , where the function @xmath26 was almost perfectly linear .",
    "data on pure cps and lps was obtained from literature @xcite .",
    "figure [ dsim ] shows the variation of the diffusivity as a function of the fraction of the lps for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . as the linear fraction increases , the diffusivities of both , the cps and lps decrease , although @xmath30 drops more sharply .",
    "this is particularly evident for @xmath29 .",
    "further , that decrease is most pronounced at small @xmath31 .",
    "experimental data on entangled dna solutions ( fig . 3 from ref .",
    "@xcite ) suggest that lps diffuse more sluggishly in a cp matrix than in a lp matrix , and that the strength of this slowdown increases with @xmath9 .",
    "this is possibly the reason why the decrease in @xmath32 at small @xmath31 is more prominent for @xmath29 .",
    "other studies on polystyrene melts ( fig . 2 from ref .",
    "@xcite ) suggest that @xmath32 is independent of the composition of the blend , which appears to be true over a wide composition range in figure [ dsim ] .",
    "the apparent contradiction in these two datasets may be partially reconciled through our findings . in all likelihood",
    ", a small fraction of the supposed polystyrene cps in the matrix were contaminated with lps,@xcite increasing the actual @xmath31 .",
    "it is then conceivable that in the window of observation the decrease in @xmath32 at small @xmath31 was not captured .",
    "( open symbols ) and @xmath29 ( filled symbols ) at different blend compositions .",
    "[ dsim ] ]      in order to interpret these simulation results , we suggest a minimal model , which ignores prefactors and other numerical details . in this scheme",
    ", we visualize a cp in a blend , which is threaded by @xmath33 surrounding lps .",
    "we recall from previous simulations that the average number of entanglements on a cp , @xmath33 , varies according to the linear fraction as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the average number of entanglements on a lp and is independent of blend composition @xcite .    the threaded lps restrain the mobility of the cp . as some of the lps venture out , others arrive and",
    "form entanglements at the same rate , and the equilibrium structure of the melt is not disturbed .",
    "consequently , the primitive path of the cp itself undergoes local rearrangement as it relaxes by constraint release ( cr ) rouse motion @xcite .",
    "one can argue that , @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are characteristic timescales for the motion of a cp in a blend and in a pure melt ( no lps ) , respectively , and @xmath39 is the characteristic cr timescale .",
    "when @xmath40 , it follows that @xmath41 , and hence @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , when @xmath43 , we expect @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the characteristic timescales for cps and lps may be approximated by @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , respectively . using standard cr arguments , the local hopping time for the @xmath33  effective rouse \" beads ( entanglements on the cp primitive path )",
    "is set by the lp relaxation time @xmath48 , and one obtains the familiar @xmath49 .",
    "however , this does not complete the description of the cr process , because it assumes that the frictional drag per entanglement segment of the cp , or the effective rouse bead , @xmath50 is a constant . as mentioned earlier , for a cp of a given length @xmath9 ,",
    "the number of rouse beads @xmath33 varies with the composition of the clb .",
    "if @xmath51 is the monomeric friction coefficient , then the total frictional drag of the cp is @xmath52 , which is distributed among the @xmath33 effective rouse beads .",
    "therefore , @xmath53 , and ignoring constants , @xmath54    thus , equation [ modeleqn0 ] can be rewritten as , @xmath55 further , @xmath56 is a weak function of both @xmath9 and @xmath31 , and is easily dominated by the change in self - diffusivity @xcite . neglecting this change in the size ,",
    "we rearrange eqn .",
    "[ modeleqn ] as ,    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are constants that account for prefactors , ignored in this minimal model .    from our simulations ( fig .",
    "[ dsim ] ) , and from prior primitive path analysis,@xcite all the parameters in eqn .",
    "[ modelfin ] can be determined , and the viability of the minimal model can be ascertained . as shown in figure [ sec ] ,",
    "all the available simulation data , independent of composition and molecular weight , collapse on to a linear master curve .",
    ", the self - diffusivity simulation data ( solid symbols ) on @xmath28 ( circles ) and @xmath29 ( diamonds ) and experimental data ( open symbols ) on the self - diffusivity of cps in an entangled linear dna matrix ( ref @xcite ) at different concentrations , and three different molecular weights are replotted .",
    "the straight line confirms that there is a linear relationship between the quantities on the horizontal and vertical axes .",
    "[ sec ] ]    to test whether experimental data may also abide by eqn .",
    "[ modelfin ] , we employed recently published self - diffusivity data on solutions of linear and cyclic dna @xcite . in this study , the authors used fluorescence microscopy to measure the diffusivities @xmath60 of tracer lps and cps , in a matrix of either lps or cps , where the subscripts @xmath61 and @xmath62 represent the topologies of the tracer and matrix molecules , respectively . these diffusivities were compiled as a function of contour length ( 5.9-kbp , 11.1-kbp , 25-kbp and 45kbp ) , and total solution concentration ( up to 1 mg / ml ) , and for small values of these two variables the systems were not entangled . using data on @xmath63 ( linear tracer in a linear matrix ) , we demarcated the transition from unentangled to entangled dynamics . thus , from figures 2 and 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite , we found that the 5.9-kbp sample is too short to be entangled , at any concentration .",
    "the concentrations at which the shift to reptation dynamics is observed for the pure lps of length 11.1-kbp , 25-kbp and 45kbp samples , was 0.7 mg / ml , 0.6 mg / ml and 0.4 mg / ml , respectively . for the most well - entangled systems , they observed @xmath64 , which is in accordance with simulation data on @xmath29 .",
    "thus , there are 16 data - points available in the entangled regime at different lengths and concentrations for a tracer cp in a lp matrix . under these conditions , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "similarly , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .    the total concentration @xmath69 , and contour length @xmath70 contribute differently to the overall dynamics @xcite . in the present analysis ,",
    "the relevant relationships are the dependence of the average number of entanglements per chain on these two parameters .",
    "we recall that at a given @xmath69 , that the average number of entanglements per polymer chain is proportional to its contour length , @xmath71 .",
    "similarly , for a given @xmath70 , the entanglement density increases with @xmath69 . since the modulus @xmath72 , and the entanglement length @xmath73",
    ", it follows that @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "thus , in the present case , @xmath75 , where @xmath76=3 kbp , and @xmath77=1 mg / ml were chosen,@xcite although it should be pointed out that different values for the entanglement molecular weight of dna solutions at @xmath781 mg / ml between @xmath79 1 - 30 kbp are supported in the literature @xcite . if we superpose these data - points ( fig .",
    "[ sec ] ) , we find that although two of the 16 data - points diverge from the trendline , the rest of the data are in very good agreement with the predicted linear dependence .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations to estimate the self - diffusivity of entangled cps and lps in blends , and constructed a simple constraint release model .",
