    "in july 2010 the  satellite detected a gamma - ray transient source , agl j2241 + 4454 , below the galactic plane @xcite , thus far from the strong diffuse galactic emission . within the  position error box",
    "there are only 4 prominent x - ray sources : rx j2243.1 + 4441 , a radio quasar @xcite ; , an eclipsing binary of beta lyr type @xcite ; , a rotationally variable star @xcite ; and mwc 656 , a massive be star .",
    "both hd 215325 and tyc 3226 - 1310 - 1 star systems do not host the conditions for gamma - ray emission processes , such as accreting companions or the collision of two strong stellar winds , which could accelerate particles up to relativistic energies and thus produce gamma rays . as we will show throughout the paper , we consider  as the most likely candidate to be the counterpart of the gamma - ray transient emission",
    ".    has been recently discovered as the first binary system containing a black hole ( bh ) and a be companion star @xcite .",
    "this system was discovered thanks to its putative association with the transient gamma - ray source  @xcite that triggered multiwavelength observations .",
    "this binary system is located at galactic coordinates @xmath1100@xmath218 , -12@xmath240@xmath3 and shows a photometric modulation of 60.37 @xmath4 0.04 days @xcite which suggested its binary nature , confirmed by @xcite .",
    "phase zero , @xmath5 , is definded at the optical maximum ( 53242.8 mjd ) and the periastron occurs at @xmath6 @xcite . in the latter paper",
    ", it was found that the compact object is a bh with a mass between 3.86.9 @xmath7 , and the be star was reclassified as a b1.5-b2 iii type star with a mass between 1016 @xmath7 .",
    "x - ray follow up observations revealed a faint x - ray source @xcite compatible with the position of the be star , allowing for the classification of this system as a high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was fitted with a black - body plus a powerlaw model .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity in the 0.35.5  kev band is @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "the measured x - ray spectrum is dominated by the non - thermal component , with a non - thermal luminosity @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 for the estimated bh mass .",
    "this very low x - ray luminosity is compatible with the binary system being in quiescence during the x - ray observations and is at the level of the faintest low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) ever detected , such as a0620@xmath1200 @xcite and xte  j1118 + 480 @xcite .",
    "the non - thermal component is interpreted in @xcite as the contribution arising from the vicinity of the bh and is studied in the context of the accretion / ejection coupling seen in lmxbs @xcite , and also in the context of the radio / x - ray luminosity correlation @xcite .",
    "recent vla radio observations by @xcite showed that the binary system is also a weak radio source with variable emission .",
    "the peak of the radio flux density is @xmath13jy for a single @xmath142h observation taken in 2015 february 22 , at orbital phase @xmath140.49 , while 6 following radio observations carried out during 2015 at the same sensitivity did not show any radio signal .",
    "however , stacking these other 6 observations yielded a detection with a flux density of @xmath15jy compatible with the position of .    at tev energies ,",
    "was observed in 2012 and in 2013 with the magic telescopes .",
    "the 2013 observatinons were contemporaneous to the _ xmm - newton _ observation by @xcite . according to x - ray and optical data ,",
    "these observations were thus performed during an x - ray quiescent state of the binary system and yielded only upper limits to its possible very - high energy ( vhe ) emission at the level of @xmath16 @xmath17 s@xmath9 above 300  gev @xcite .",
    "x - ray binary ( xrb ) systems containing a be star have been studied for a long time through radio and x - ray surveys .",
    "these systems are characterized by their variable x - ray emission and for their strong radio flares .",
    "out of 184 known bexrb systems , in 119 of them the x - ray pulsations are observed , confirming that the compact component must be a neutron star @xcite . in the remaining bexrb ,",
    "the nature of the compact object is still unknown , with no confirmed bh known with a be companion .",
    "this is known as the missing be / bh binary problem @xcite , and the predicted number of existing systems of this kind at any time is a few tens in our galaxy @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the newly discovered  system opens a new window in the study of this class of binaries .",
    "the missing be / bh population could then possibly reveal itself through gamma - ray surveys more easily than with x - ray surveys and could have been subject to selection effects up to now .    in this work we present new  and  data analysis",
    ": we searched for persistent , transient and periodic emission at the position of .",
    "we also discuss possible counterparts of the gamma - ray events and the possible association of the transient gamma - ray emission found with  in the context of the accretion / ejection scenario .",
    "although  seems to be the most favoured candidate to produce the transient emission that has been detected by , we can not discard another source as the counterpart .    in the vicinity of",
    "there is a  source , 3fgl  j2247.8 + 4413 , which is identified with nvss j224753 + 441317 , a bl lac object @xcite .",
    "it is located at galactic coordinates @xmath18 @xmath19100@xmath272,-13@xmath225@xmath3 , at a distance of 0@xmath293 from the position of .",
    "we considered this source at the time of analyzing  data in order to take into account possible contamination .",
    "however , this is a very faint source with a flux of @xmath20  @xmath17  s@xmath9 and variable behaviour .",
    "hence , in the short time periods when  detected the transient emission the effect of 3fgl  j2247.8 + 4413 on the detection is negligible .",
    "the error box of the first  transient detection is 1@xmath22 in diameter . as for x - ray emitting sources in the field ,",
    "there is a known quasar near , @xcite , which appears also in the x - ray images taken by @xcite .",
    "quasars are known to produce also flaring activity at many wavelengths @xcite and this could be the case",
    ". however , there is little information about rx  j2243.1 + 4441 , its behaviour and characteristics , due to the lack of optical counterpart and scarce radio and x - ray data .",
    "this source can be classified as a radio galaxy through its radio morphology @xcite : it presents a bright core at the center of the galaxy with a radio flux of 2.2 mjy beam@xmath9 , stable over month timescales with faint signatures of a jet , and two radio lobes expanding towards the intergalactic medium spanning more than 50@xmath21 .",
    "however , the available radio data at only one frequency does not allow for a spectral characterization of the source .",
    "the radio morphology of this object resembles the classical fr - ii type radio galaxies .",
    "while fr i - type radio galaxies have been found to emit in gamma rays in several cases @xcite , fr - ii type seem to be more rare in the gev sky @xcite , disfavouring , although not excluding , rx  j2243.1 + 4441 as the putative counterpart of .    in the x - rays , a revision of the xmm - newton data (",
    "obs i d 0723610201 ) , shows that the radio galaxy exhibits a spectrum with peak around 0.5 kev and fades away above 5 kev .",
    "the spectral fit with an absorbed powerlaw model yields a photon index @xmath22 and a flux in the 0.2@xmath125.0 kev range of f@xmath23 erg @xmath17 s@xmath9 .",
    "this results are roughly compatible within uncertainties with the @xcite results using _",

    "is a gamma - ray astrophysics mission operating since 2007 april @xcite .",
    "it carries two main co - aligned instruments observing at hard x - rays between 18 and 60 kev ( super- , @xcite ) and at high - energy ( he ) gamma rays between 30 mev and 30 gev ( /grid , @xcite ) . the instrumentation is completed by a calorimeter sensitive in the 0.4100 mev range @xcite and an anticoincidence detector @xcite .  has a wide field of view of about 2.5  sr at he gamma rays and good sensitivity above 100 mev .",
    "the psf at 100 mev and 400 mev is 3@xmath25 and 1@xmath25 ( 68% containment radius ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity after one week of integration time in pointing mode is at the level of 2030@xmath24 @xmath17 s@xmath9 above 100 mev , depending on the off - axis angles and pointing directions @xcite .    since november 2009  is observing in scanning mode , covering the whole sky every few hours .",
    "this observation mode allows us for the study of serendipitous sources , such as agl  j2241 + 4454 .",
    "typical sensitivity in this observing mode is @xmath25 @xmath17 s@xmath9 for 2-day integration time .",
    "the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope was launched in june 2008 and carries onboard two main instruments : the large area telescope ( lat ) and the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) .",
    "the lat is a non - homogeneous pair conversion tracker that works in the 30 mev to 300 gev energy range and has a large collection area , ranging from 1000 to 5000 @xmath26 for the front - lat component .",
    "the instrument 68% containment radius ranges from 7@xmath27 to 0.1@xmath27 in the considered energy range and the instrument angular resolution is optimized around 1gev @xcite",
    ".  operates in scanning mode , monotiring continuously a wide part of the sky every few hours , with a typical sensitivity of @xmath28 @xmath17 s@xmath9 for 1-day integration .",
    "note that , due to the scanning observing mode , sources spend a very small amount of time ( if any ) on - axis .",
    "the analysis of gamma - ray data presented in this work was carried out with the /grid",
    "ft3.119_i0023 build22 calibrated filter with a gamma - ray event selection that takes into account south atlantic anomaly event cuts and 80@xmath29 earth albedo filtering . throughout the work , statistical significance assessment and source flux determination were established using the standard  multi - source likelihood analysis software @xcite .",
    "the method provides an assessment of the statistical significance in terms of a test statistic ( ts ) defined as in @xcite and asymptotically distributed as a @xmath30 for 3 degrees of freedom ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "a search for persistent gamma - ray emission has been conducted over the public  consolidated archive available from the asi science data center at the time of the analysis , which covered observations up to the end of 2013 .",
    "we performed a multi - source likelyhood analysis above 100  mev of the @xmath147 years of  data and no detection arose so far and an upper limit at the level of @xmath32 @xmath17 s@xmath9 has been obtained .",
    "we do not expect to find persistent gamma - ray emission in this system since xrbs spend most of their time in a quiescent state @xcite . during this state",
    "there is no presence of a radio jet , or it is not powerful enough to accelerate particles up to he , and hence the possibility of producing inverse compton ( ic ) and/or pion decay emission is scarce . in figure",
    "[ fig : deeppointing ] we show a wide field of view intensity map with a long integration time where the  is not visible and its position is marked with a white cross .        on the 27@xmath33 of july 2010 the  team reported transient gamma - ray activity detected from an unidentified source at galactic coordinates @xmath34100@xmath20 , -12@xmath22@xmath3 during the period 2010 - 07 - 25 01:00  2010 - 07 - 26 23:30 ut @xcite . a refined maximum likelihood analysis of this transient event yields a 5.3  @xmath35 detection with a flux of @xmath36 @xmath17 s@xmath9",

    "after the gamma - ray detection in 2010 and the discovery of  as a be / bh binary system in a position compatible with , a search for transient emission at other epochs has been performed .",
    "a blind search multi - source likelihood analysis around the position of  for energies above 100  mev has been conducted in 2-day bins with no overlap between them , yielding a total of 10 gamma - ray transient or flaring events at a position compatible , within their 95% position uncertainties , with the one reported in @xcite , and with the position of .",
    "these transient events spread from 2007 up to 2013 , including both pointing and spinning observations and the details about each one are displayed in table [ tab : detections ] . in this table we list the peak position of the transient emission , in galactic coordinates , the date and time of the starting and ending of the transient events , the flux and the significance as @xmath37 . in figure",
    "[ fig : lc ] we show the flux of these detections plotted over time , in mjd units , toghether with the significance of each one . a total of 151 and 758 2-day bins were analyzed for pointing and spinning observations , respectively .",
    "given that the significance of most of the events found is only a bit above 3@xmath35 we computed the probability of this detections to be by chance using the procedure explained in @xcite . with this method we computed the probability of having @xmath38 detections -consistent with the position of , and hence with - with a significance @xmath39 with @xmath40 trials , which is given by :      where @xmath42 is the @xmath42-value corresponding to @xmath43 which , for a detection significance @xmath44 for a source below the galactic plane whose counterpart might be known , is @xmath45 . for the @xmath46 2-day bins in which we searched for transient events the probability of the 10 detections being by chance is @xmath47 , which translates into 4.97 gaussian standard deviations .",
