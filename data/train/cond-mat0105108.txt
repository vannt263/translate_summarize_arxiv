    "the goal of this study is to deepen our understanding of the quantum - classical correspondence for chaotic systems by analyzing the properties of eigenstates and local density of states ( ldos ) in the energy representation .",
    "this novel approach has already been successfully applied to models of two interacting particles @xcite and to a three orbital schematic shell model @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend this approach to chaotic periodic billiards by incorporating the effects of the boundaries into the hamiltonian operator and treating the degrees of freedom as independent  particles \" .",
    "some results of this work were advanced in @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section ii presents some basic features of the classical dynamics of the rippled billiard , together with the necessary details of its quantum description . in section",
    "iii the classical representation of the model is given .",
    "in section iv we discuss the meaning of the structure of eigenstates ( ses ) and ldos , and in sections v and vi we define their classical counterparts . in section vii",
    "we compare the quantum and classical ses and ldos .",
    "section viii pertains to the individual properties of eigenstates and ldos . in section",
    "ix we make some clncluding remarks .",
    "the system that we shall use to explore the quantum - classical correspondence is a 2d billiard with periodic boundary conditions along the longitudinal coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "the top profile is given by the function @xmath1 with @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the amplitude of the ripple and @xmath4 is the width of the billiard when @xmath3 is zero .",
    "the bottom boundary is flat ( see fig .",
    "the first studies of the classical dynamics of this system were performed in ref .",
    "@xcite in connection with the beam - beam interaction problem ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the finite length version of this system was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite as a model of a mesoscopic electron waveguide , where a transport signature of chaos in the behavior of resistivity was established .",
    "the same model has been also used @xcite to study certain _ quantum _ transport properties through ballistic cavities . on the other hand , the analysis of the band - energy spectrum for an _ infinitely _ long rippled channel @xcite in the cases of mixed and global classical chaos , provides insight into the universal features of electronic band structures of real crystals @xcite . in ref.@xcite a similar periodic billiard",
    "was considered in connection with the problem of chaotic diffusion in the systems with band spectra , see also refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an attractive feature of this rippled channel is that its classical phase space undergoes the generic transition to global chaos as the ripple amplitude @xmath3 increases .",
    "hence results obtained for this particular system are expected to be applicable to a large class of systems , namely non - degenerate , non - integrable hamiltonians .    in the quantum description the model is given by the hamiltonian @xmath5 for the wave function @xmath6 obeying the boundary conditions , @xmath7 , at @xmath8 and @xmath9 . there",
    "exist various numerical methods that can be used to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of non - integrable billiards , such as the transfer matrix approach @xcite , the scaling method @xcite , and the scattering approach @xcite . here",
    "we shall employ a different technique that is taylored to explore the quantum - classical correspondence of the structure of eigenstates .",
    "it consists of representing the hamiltonian ( [ ham0 ] ) in new coordinates ( @xmath10 ) in such a way that the effects of the boundary are transferred to an effective interaction potential between the two degrees of freedom @xmath11 .",
    "that is , the coordinates ( @xmath10 ) are chosen so that the new wave function satisfies  flat \" boundary conditions : @xmath12 at @xmath13 ; @xmath4 . for our rippled channel ,",
    "this can be accomplished by the transformation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a measure of the perturbation due to the ripple @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger equation in the new coordinates can be obtained from the covariant expression for a particle moving ( in the absence of potentials ) in a riemannian curved space @xcite , @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the laplace - beltrami operator , @xmath18 is the metric and @xmath19 is the metric tensor .",
    "even though ( [ delta ] ) is still the kinetic energy , the resulting differential equation takes a much more complicated form than the ordinary laplacian .",
    "this is the price we have to pay when we transfer the effect of the boundaries onto the operator [ the explicit form of the schrdinger equation in @xmath11 coordinates for the rippled billiard is given in @xcite ] .",
    "moreover , the coordinate representation of the canonical momentum has now the form @xcite , @xmath20= -i\\hbar g^{-1/4}\\partial_\\alpha g^{1/4}.\\ ] ]    substitution of this expression into the schrdinger equation ( [ delta ] ) determines the quantum hamiltonian in covariant form @xcite @xmath21 substituting now the explicit expressions for the metric tensor @xmath19 and metric @xmath18 , @xmath22 @xmath23 ^ 2,\\ ] ] we get @xmath24 \\right\\ } g^{1/4 } \\label{ham1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 .",
    "note that the rippled boundary is fully incorporated into the hamiltonian operator . since the boundary conditions in the new coordinates correspond to those of a",
    " flat \" channel , @xmath12 at @xmath13 ; @xmath4 . for our purposes",
    "it is convenient now to separate the hamiltonian ( 8) as @xmath26 where @xmath27 with [ c. f. ( 4 ) and ( 7 ) ] @xmath28,\\ \\",
    "\\hat p_v = -i \\hbar \\partial_v,\\ ] ] and @xmath29 stands for the rest of the terms .",
    "we remark that this representation allows us to treat the original model of one free particle in the rippled channel as a 1d model of two interacting  particles \" identified with the two degrees of freedom @xmath30 and @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the hamiltonian of two _ non - interacting particles_. the eigenfunctions of @xmath32 define the unperturbed basis in which the eigenstates of the total hamiltonian @xmath33 may be expanded .",
    "such a representation turns out to be convenient for the study of chaotic properties of the model since one can use the tools and concepts developed in the theory of interacting particles ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "since the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) is periodic in @xmath30 , the eigenstates are bloch states .",
    "this allows us to write the solution of the schrdinger equation in the form @xmath34 with @xmath35 . for an infinite periodic channel",
    "the bloch wave vector @xmath36 takes a continuous range of values , which we take to lie on the first brillouin zone ( @xmath37 .    by expanding @xmath38 in a double fourier series",
    "the @xmath39-th eigenstate of energy @xmath40 can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 \\end{array } \\label{phi}\\ ] ] are the eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath43 with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath44 .",

    "( [ phi ] ) appears from the orthonormality condition in the curvilinear coordinates @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the exact eigenstates are expanded in a complete orthonormal basis satisfying the boundary conditions of the problem , _",
    "i.e. _ , a galerkin series expansion @xcite .",
    "so far , there has been no need to specify the ripple function @xmath46 , except that it is periodic : @xmath2 . for concreteness",
    ", we consider from now on the dependence @xmath47 .",
    "the ripple profile is given by @xmath48 where @xmath0 , @xmath49 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 are dimensionless quantities .",
    "the latter are defined from the expression @xmath50 scaled to the period @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath51 are dimensional quantities .",
    "this approach to solving the schrdinger equation was used to calculate the energy - band structure and husimi distributions of the rippled channel @xcite , and to obtain the energy level statistics under the conditions of full and mixed chaos @xcite .",
    "specifically , in ref.@xcite the energy level spacing distribution was shown to be poisson , wigner - dyson , or intermediate between these two , for regular , globally chaotic , or mixed classical motion , respectively , in agreement with the well known rmt conjecture @xcite .",
    "most relevant to our work here is the fact that these distributions were found to be the same for all values of @xmath60 within the brillouin zone , except @xmath61 for which the parity symmetry should be taken into account .",
    "thus , without loss of generality we fix the value @xmath62 .",
    "we shall also use in all our calculations the following values for the ampliutude @xmath3 and width @xmath4 of the rippled channel : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "these values produce representative global chaotic motion in the classical limit ( see below ) .    in order to study the structure of eigenstates of the total hamiltonian @xmath65 one needs , first , to choose a way of ordering the unperturbed basis in which to represent the hamiltonian matrix @xmath66 .",
    "specifically , we have to assign an index @xmath67 , labeling the basis state @xmath68 , to each pair of indecies @xmath69 ( note that , although the energy spectra is independent of the assignment @xmath70 , the structure of the eigenstates is not ) .",
    "the size of the hamiltonian matrix is determined by the maximum values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 : @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "a natural assignment is the following one .",
    "let us fix the lowest value of @xmath71 @xmath75 and sweep all values of @xmath76 .",
    "this gives @xmath77 .",
    "then do the same for @xmath78 , which gives @xmath79 , and so on , till finally we have @xmath80 , where @xmath81 defines the matrix size , @xmath82 .",
    "this rule results in a block structure of the hamiltonian matrix , with block size equal to @xmath83 .",
    "2 shows the central part of a @xmath84 matrix with @xmath85 . here",
    "we can see a number of blocks of size @xmath86 corresponding to @xmath87 . in this representation",
    "the matrix is clearly a band matrix .",
    "the finite size of the band is due to the short range coupling between different blocks , namely , the strength of the matrix elements decrease as @xmath88 , @xmath89 , or @xmath90 ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "the above way of ordering the unperturbed basis is typical ; it corresponds to the  channel representation \" since the index @xmath72 labels a specific transverse channel ( or mode ) for the propagation of the wave through the billiard , see eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) .",
    "however , for our purposes it is essential to use the  energy representation \" , according to which the unperturbed basis is ordered in increasing energy , @xmath91 .",
    "this defines a new rule @xmath92 .",
    "3 shows the difference between these two ways of ordering of the basis , giving the normalized unperturbed energy @xmath93=@xmath94 with @xmath95 , as a function of @xmath67 .",
    "a non - monotonic dependence of the energy occurs in fig .",
    "3a because the first rule @xmath96 described above produces minimum values in the energy for @xmath97 .",
    "in contrast , in fig .",
    "3b a linear dependence of the unperturbed energy on the index @xmath98 is shown , apart from large values of @xmath98 where the finiteness of the matrix results in the distortion of the spectra . the numerical obtained linear dependence , @xmath99 , can be derived analytically from weyl s formula @xmath100 , valid for 2d billiards with area @xmath101 ( also valid for _ periodic _ 2d billiards ) @xcite .",
    "a crucial point is that the eigenstates of the total hamiltonian in the  energy representation \" have a very convenient form for the analysis .",
    "the advantage of the  energy representation \" is clearly seen in fig .",
    "4 where an arbitrarily chosen eigenstate is given in the two representations .",
    "one can see that in one case the eigenstate has a kind of regular and extended structure , while in the other , the eigenstate is compresed around the unperturbed state whose energy is close to the energy of the perturbed state . in the latter case one may use a statistical approach to describe the global properties of such eigenstates , see refs.@xcite .",
    "specifically , we may characterize such eigenstate by introducing an envelope around which the components are expected to fluctuate in a pseudo - random way .",
    "we stress that by using this energy ordering one can relate the global form of eigenstates in the energy representation with its classical counterpart , see below .",
    "clearly , the type of motion of a particle in the ripple billiard depends on the values of the geometrical parameters , namely , on the ripple amplitude @xmath3 and the average width @xmath4 .",
    "if the channel is narrow , @xmath102 , the poincare section reveals a large resonance island surrounded by the typical poincare - birkhoff structure @xcite .",
    "this island is formed by the librational motion along the @xmath0 direction in the neighborhood of @xmath103 . on the contrary , for wide channels ( @xmath104 ) global chaos",
    "occurs even for small amplitudes due to a strong overlap of resonances . in this work",
    "we shall limit ourselves to the study of global chaos , _ i.e. _ , wide channels .",
    "the condition of global chaos can be derived analytically for the case of small amplitude @xmath105 where the following approximate map is valid @xcite , @xmath106 here @xmath107 is the position of a particle and @xmath108 is the angle between the @xmath0-axis and the velocity of the particle , right after the @xmath109th collision with the upper wall .",
    "the standard linearization around fixed points of period one yields , @xmath110 where the angle @xmath111 and the position @xmath112 , measured from the fixed point , play the role of the action and angle variables , respectively .",
    "( [ map1 ] ) has the form of the _ standard map _ with @xmath113 as the nonlinear parameter .",
    "hence , chirikov s overlapping criteria predicts the onset of global chaos for @xmath114 .",
    "this was confirmed by computing numerically the actual path of the particle as it travels along the channel .",
    "specifically , for @xmath115 the poincare section @xmath116 shows global chaos for wide channels . in this paper",
    "we shall consider a wide channel with small ripple amplitude , specified by the parameters @xmath117 , therefore , @xmath118 .",
    "let us now write , as in the quantum description , the classical hamiltonian in the @xmath11 coordinates so that the effects of the rippled boundary can be incorporated as a kind of coupling between two degrees of freedom .",
    "the classical hamiltonian is @xmath119 which can be obtained from the quantum hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) by commuting all momenta and coordinates @xcite .    for completeness",
    ", the canonical transformation between @xmath120 and @xmath121 are given by eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) together with @xmath122 , and @xmath123 . inserting the metric tensor",

    "once the matrix @xmath129 has been diagonalized , its eigenstates @xmath130 are also re - ordered in energy : @xmath131 .",
    "we adopt the convention that the greek superindex ( latin subindex ) denotes the exact ( unperturbed ) state .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath132 form the  state vector matrix \" .",
    "the elements along the row @xmath39 of this matrix are the components of the @xmath133 eigenstate in the representation of the unperturbed energy - ordered basis .",
    "correspondingly , the elements along the column @xmath67 give the unperturbed state @xmath67 expanded in the energy ordered perturbed basis .",
    "for our purposes , we examine the matrix @xmath134 ( see fig .",
    "5 ) which plays the central role in our approach .    the rows of the matrix @xmath135 show how a specific eigenfunction ( eigenstate @xmath136 ) is expanded in the unperturbed basis @xmath137 .",
    "since the average `` band width '' of @xmath138 smoothly depends on the index @xmath39 ( equivalently on the energy @xmath139 ) , it is convenient to average @xmath135 over a small range of eigenstates . in this way",
    ", one can obtain the so - called _ structure of eigenstates _ ( ses ) in the unperturbed basis . in what follows ,",
    "we are interested in the ses in the energy representation which is defined as @xcite , @xmath140 where @xmath141 with @xmath142 as the number of eigenstates @xmath143 in the vicinity of a given @xmath39 .",
    "the structure of eigenstates @xmath144 gives the dependence on the unperturbed energy @xmath145 for eigenstates with total energy close to @xmath139 .",
    "this sum can be approximated by an integral that involves the density of states @xmath146 providing the transition from the basis to the energy representation .",
    "this function ses plays the key role in the determination of important physical quantities , such as the distribution of occupation numbers in chaotic closed systems ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "analogously , one can analyze the columns of the matrix @xmath135 which give information about a given _ unperturbed _ state @xmath137 is spanned over _ exact _ eigenstates @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , one can define the following quantity @xmath147 which is well known in nuclear physics as the _ strength function _ , and in solid state physics , as the _ local density of states _ ( ldos ) . in ( [ ldos ] ) the summation ( average )",
    "is done over @xmath142 _ basis _ states @xmath148 around a fixed state @xmath137 , @xmath149 .",
    "therefore , this quantity is considered as a function of the energy @xmath139 .",
    "it shows how a given unperturbed state @xmath150 is coupled to the exact states due to the interaction @xmath151 . the width of this function ( _ spreading width _ ) determines the energy range associated with the  decay \" of a given unperturbed state into other states when the interaction is switched on .",
    "an essential point is that both , the structure of eigenstates and the local density of states , have well defined classical analogs @xcite .",
    "let us first start with the ses . since @xmath152 as a function of @xmath67 is the _ projection _ of the perturbed state onto the states of the unperturbed system , the classical counterpart of @xmath153 as a function of energy @xmath154 can be defined as the _ projection _ of the total hamiltonian @xmath155 onto the unperturbed one @xmath32 , where @xmath156 with @xmath151 the perturbation @xcite .",
    "this projection can be numerically done by substituting the trajectories @xmath157 generated by the hamiltonian @xmath155 with energy @xmath158 onto the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath32 . since",
    "the unperturebed energy @xmath159 along these trajectories varies in time , it fills the so - called _ energy shell _ characterized by its width @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , for chaotic total hamiltonians @xmath155 , the classical analog @xmath161 of the quantum ses can be easily obtained from @xmath159 .    in fig .",
    "6a we show the energy of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath32 as a function of time after the substitution of a single chaotic trajectory @xmath162 generated by the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath155 , into @xmath32 . the classical distribution @xmath163 ( see fig .",
    "6b ) is constructed from @xmath159 , averaged over a sufficiently long time . alternatively , since the dynamics of @xmath155 is chaotic , the same distribution can be obtained by averaging over many different orbits at a shorter time . for concreteness , in",
    "what follows we chose @xmath164 .",
    "it is important to understand the origin of the shape of the classical distribution , see fig .",
    "6b , in view of its correspondence to the quantum ses . for this , let us examine in detail characteristic time intervals of the plot of @xmath159 together with plots of @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath31 , see figs .",
    "7a - d . from fig .",
    "6a it is clear that the main contribution to the central peak of the distribution @xmath161 comes from the continuous time intervals where @xmath167 .",
    "these intervals in turn correspond to @xmath168 ( the maximum value ) and to @xmath169 ( see figs .",
    "7b - c ) . during these time",
    "intervals the particle travels almost parallel to the @xmath0 axis ( @xmath30 axis ) .",
    "in fact , from the plot of @xmath170 ( fig .",
    "7d ) one can see that the particle hits only once the bottom boundary during a relatively long time .",
    "the contribution to the central peak can be also be seen directly from the expressions ( [ h0cl ] ) and ( [ vcl ] ) . indeed , since @xmath171 , we have @xmath172 .    in the same way one can understand the origin of two side - band peaks in the form of @xmath161 , clearly seen in fig .",
    "6b . the data reported in fig .",
    "8a - d show that for small time intervals e. g. , ( @xmath173 and @xmath174 ) the value of @xmath175 is practically constant ( @xmath176 and @xmath177 resepectively ) .",
    "these values of @xmath175 correspond to the right and left peaks in fig .",
    "contrary to the data in fig .",
    "6 explaining the origin of the central peak , in the two time regions of fig .",
    "8 the value of @xmath165 is nearly zero and @xmath166 is nearly maximum ( see fig .",
    "in these regions the motion of the particle is almost perpendicular to the @xmath0-axis ( @xmath30-axis ) .",
    "the form of the profile @xmath178 in our ripple channel results in two periodic orbits of period one : the stable one for @xmath179 , and the unstable one for @xmath180 . putting these values for @xmath181 and @xmath30 into expressions ( 18 - 19 )",
    ", we find the values for @xmath166 .",
    "this allows us to obtain the value of @xmath32 for these two periodic orbit , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , respectively for @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "thus , the left ( right ) peak of the distribution @xmath161 is formed by trajectories dwelling near the unstable ( stable ) periodic orbits of period one .",
    "in analogy with the quantum ldos , the classical ldos distribution @xmath186 is constructed by projecting the dynamics generated by @xmath187 onto the hamiltonian @xmath156 . here , because @xmath32 is integrable , several ( _ regular _ ) trajectories of @xmath32 have to be substituted into @xmath155 and then averaged in time , in contrast with the classical ses where only one ( _ chaotic _ ) trajectory over a sufficiently long time is needed to form the distribution .",
    "the result of this procedure is exemplified in fig .",
    "9a where @xmath188 is shown for @xmath189 regular trajectories , whose initial conditions were chosen to lie on a mesh of points distributed uniformily in the plane ( @xmath190 ) ( @xmath31 is fixed and @xmath191 is determined by the constant energy @xmath192 ) .",

    "hence the appearance of @xmath193 similar sets formed by @xmath193 small time intervals .",

    "any trajectory reveals one of these three types of behavior of @xmath188 ; @xmath164 , bar code , and noise - like structure .",
    "the averaging over these time intervals yields the distribution shown in fig .",
    "9b , quite different from the classical ses ( fig .",
    "6 ) although it also has the central peak and two other peaks on each side .",
    "having understood the dynamical origin of the main features of the classical distributions @xmath161 ( ses ) and @xmath186 ( ldos ) , we now compare them with the corresponding quantum quantities . although the ses for a given @xmath39 , see eq .",

    "the ratio of the de broglie wavelength @xmath212 to some characteristic length of the billiard may be used as a semiclassical parameter ( recall that there are two length parameters defining the flat channel , @xmath58 and @xmath51 ; in this work we have used @xmath213 ) . for example @xmath214 , where @xmath215 , tells us how large the energy of the eigenstate should be for its wavelength to be many times smaller than the width of the channel .",
    "substitution of weyl s formula @xmath216 into the above expression for @xmath217 gives a more useful formula : @xmath218 here we only need to know the number of the eigenstate ( as oppossed to the energy ) to determine the ratio @xmath219 .",

    "the classical ses is also shown .",
    "as it may be expected , these figures show that as @xmath222 becomes smaller the number of unperturbed states needed to form the pertubed state increases .",
    "specifically , level states around @xmath223 are still far from the semiclassical regime ( @xmath224 ) ; the details of the rippled boundary can not be resolved and , thus , there is only a weak mixing of the unpertubed states .",
    "in contrast , for the state @xmath225 its de broglie wavelength is a smaller fraction of the width of the channel ( @xmath226 ) and the number of participating components is larger .",
    "it is important to note that although the number of unperturbed states needed to construct the perturbed state increases as the energy increases , they all fall within the range of energies determined by the classical distribution .",
    "this range defines the _ energy shell _ of the eigenstate under consideration . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that even the level @xmath225 does not seem to have much of a resemblance with the classical distribution . for this and similar states ,",
    "we have calculated the distribution of fluctuations arround the classical curve and found that they deviate strongly from a gaussian distribution as predicted by rmt considerations .",
    "this may be related to the fact that the de broglie wavelength of level 2002 is still not much smaller than the amplitude @xmath59 of the ripple ( @xmath227 , recall a / d=0.06 ) .",
    "that is , even though @xmath219 may be small , a more relevant parameter to characterize the semiclassical regime for particular eigenstates is @xmath228 .",
    "nevertheless the strong fluctuations exemplified by the level @xmath225 ( fig .",
    "10d ) can be smoothed out by averaging over a range of perturbed states .",
    "this actually corresponds to the definition ( [ sef ] ) of the structure of eigenstates @xmath229 .",

    "11 shows , such an average does reveal a good quantum - classical correspondence even though the fluctuations are strong . specifically , the global shape of the quantum ses displays a three - peak structure , much like the classical one .",
    "in addition , the energy spread of the quantum ses agrees very well with the classically determined energy shell , even in its slight assymetry ( @xmath230 with the center at @xmath192 ) .",
    "similarly , in fig .",
    "12 we compare the quantum and classical ldos .",
    "the quantum - classical correspondence appears to be even better than for the ses in the sense that the fluctuations are smaller .",
    "to understand the origin and importance of the strong fluctuations of the ses around the classical counterpart ( see fig .",
    "11 ) , we analyze the structure of _ individual _ eigenfunctions . in fig .",
    "13 three consecutive typical eigenfunctions ( @xmath231 , @xmath232 , and @xmath233 ) are shown .",
    "the difference between the state @xmath234 and the other two is clearly qualitative . more specifically , while the states @xmath231 and @xmath232 are _ extended _ ( in energy ) states , constituted by practically all unperturbed eigenstates within the energy shell , the state @xmath234 is mostly unperturbed ; it is extremely _ localized _ in the energy shell . by neglecting all small amplitude components surrounding the main component ( see fig .",
    "13c ) , we can determine the unperturbed state , defined by a pair @xmath69 , that most closely resembles the perturbed state . we find that this always corresponds to the lowest values of the transversal mode @xmath72 .",
    "this fact can be understood by the following physical argument .",
    "consider an eigenstate of the flat channel @xmath235 with energy @xmath236 , where @xmath237 .",
    "turning on the perturbation ( flat to rippled channel ) will affect the high energy unperturbed states differently depending mainly on the value of @xmath238 .",
    "for example , for @xmath97 , the ratio @xmath239 is @xmath240 , which is so large that the state can not `` see '' the ripple and thus will remain essentially unperturbed .",
    "in contrast , for unperturbed states with the same ( or about the same ) energy but with large values of @xmath72 ( say , @xmath241 and correspondingly small @xmath242 ) their @xmath238 is sufficiently small , compared to the amplitude of the ripple ( @xmath243 ) , that the rippled boundary produces a strong mixing of unperturbed levels .",
    "the resulting perturbed state will consist of many components , extended over the energy shell . by the same token",
    ", it is expected that unperturbed states with intermediate values of @xmath72 will turn , after turning on the perturbation , into some intermediate states , the so - called sparse states [ 32 ] , made up of fewer components over the energy shell .",
    "the existence of the extremely localized ( in energy ) states manifests itself in the structure of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath244 in the channel representation ( fig .",
    "2 ) to be discussed below .",
    "it is easy to find that such wavefunctions differ only slightly from the plane waves @xmath245 with small @xmath72 , proper of the flat channel . in fig .",
    "14a one localized ( in energy ) state is shown in configuration representation .",
    "in contrast , an extended ( in energy ) state is presented in fig .",
    "eigenfunctions like that of fig .",
    "13b for @xmath246 , are somewhat intermediate between the extended and localized states .    in order to characterize quantitatively the eigenfunctions ,",
    "we compute various localization measures .",
    "the first one is the so - called _ entropy localization length _",
    "@xmath247 , @xmath248 } \\approx 2.08 \\exp { ( -\\cal h)}. \\label{shennon}\\ ] ] here @xmath249 stands for the shannon entropy of an eigenstate in a given basis , @xmath250 and @xmath251 is the entropy of a completely chaotic state which is characterized by gaussian fluctuations ( for @xmath252 ) of all components @xmath253 with the same variance @xmath254 .",
    "the latter property occurs for completely random matrices belonging to a gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .",
    "defined in this way , the quantity @xmath247 gives a measure of the effective number of components in an eigenstate .",
    "for example , the eigenstates of fig .",
    "13 have , respectively , @xmath255 , @xmath256 , and @xmath257 .",
    "the second quantity , @xmath258 , which gives another measure of the effective number of components in an eigenstate , is expressed via the _ inverse participation ratio _ @xmath259 , @xmath260 \\approx \\frac { 3}{\\cal p } , \\label{lipr}\\ ] ] with @xmath261 where @xmath262 3 is chosen in order to get @xmath263 in the goe limit case .    the above two definitions of  localization lengths \" are the most frequently used when describing global structure of eigenfunctions .",
    "one should note that these quantities give an effective number of large components , independently on the location of these components in the unperturbed basis .",
    "additional information about the structure of eigenfunctions can be obtained from the  width \" or mean square root @xmath264 of an eigenstate , computed as @xmath265 ^ 2\\right]^{1/2 } \\label{sigma}\\ ] ] where @xmath266 determines the centroid of an eigenstate in the unperturbed basis .    to get a complete panorama , in fig .",
    "15a - c we plot these three measures as a function of @xmath39 corresponding to the eigenstate @xmath136 .",
    "the strong fluctuations of all localization measures are evident in these figures .",
    "we can see that neighboring high levels may have drastically different localization measures , in agreement with the discussion above about the existence of the three types of states : localized , extended , and sparse .",
    "these figures gives us information about the relative number of each type to be found in a given energy range .",
    "comparison of the width @xmath264 with @xmath247 and @xmath258 gives the possibility to detect the so - called _ sparsity _ of eigenstates .",
    "indeed , small values of the ratio @xmath267 ( or @xmath268 ) indicates that there are many  holes \" in the structure of eigenstates , therefore , such eigenstates are _ sparse _ @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis shows a dominance of sparsed eigenstates . as for the centroid @xmath269 small fluctuations ( observed in fig .",
    "15c ) indicate that the interaction strength @xmath151 is relatively weak , compared to the unperturbed part @xmath270 .    the data of fig .",
    "15 show the existence of some pattern for all localization measures , visible as clusters of points in the lower part of the plots .",
    "these patterns are much more pronounced for the same quantities computed for the ldos , see fig . 16 . in order to understand this unexpected phenomenon ,",
    "let us take a closer look at @xmath264 in the range @xmath271 and examine the structure shown in fig .",
    "17 in detail . specifically , we choose some eigenstates from three branches of points ( see marked states in fig .",
    "17 ) . from each of these three sets",
    ", we take the @xmath272 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 , and @xmath275 states , counted from the bottom of the figure , and plot them in fig .",
    "inspection of figures 18a-18d clearly demonstrates that there is a kind of regularity in the structure of the ldos : the same type of states appear repeatedly , almost periodically as a function of the basis number @xmath67 .",
    "these figures show the repetition of extremely localized states ( fig .",
    "18a ) and of states with different degrees of sparsity ( figs .",
    "18b-18d ) .",
    "the repetition of extended states , corresponding to larger vaues of @xmath276 are not shown for economy of space but their existence is clear , as can be inferred by extrapolating the branches of fig .",
    "17 to higher values of @xmath276 .",
    "the physical origin of all these types of states ( localized , sparse and extended ) was explained above , and their appearance can be decoded by examining the structure of the `` channel representation '' of the hamiltonian matrix ( fig.2 ) . a detailed inspection of this matrix ( see also eq .",
    "( 26 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) shows that the coupling between unperturbed states depends strongly on the values of the index @xmath72 , labeling the transversal modes of the flat billiard .",
    "an unperturbed state specified by a large value of @xmath72 ( an @xmath72 close to @xmath277 ) couples strongly to several other unperturbed states . in contrast , a state with @xmath97 has practically no coupling to other states .",
    "in particular , the extremely localized states , corresponding to the first position on the left line of each brach of fig .",
    "17 occur because of the negligible coupling of the diagonal elements of the @xmath244 matrix with @xmath97 , the states on the second position of each branch occur for @xmath278 , and so on with @xmath72 odd .",
    "similarly , states on the right side of the branches result from elements of the @xmath244 matrix with even values of @xmath72 .",
    "this structure is expected to prevail at all energy ranges since in any sufficiently large range of energies there are unperturbed states with all values of @xmath72 in @xmath279 $ ] . even deep in the semiclassical regime , extremely localized and sparse states will appear but less and less frequently since the energy differences between states of the same type increases with energy .",
    "consequently , the strong fluctuations appearing in the ses and ldos distributions ( figs . 11 and 12 ) will tend to dissapear as @xmath280 .    in the definitions of ses and ldos ,",
    "the averages were performed over the appropriate range of energy in order to take into account once all the various types of states ( figs . 10 and 11 were calculated this way ) .",
    "we can understand the origin of this type of regular structure by analyzing the hamiltonian matrix @xmath244 , see fig .",
    "a detailed inspection shows that for the unperturbed states ( diagonal matrix elements ) , the coupling with other unperturbed states depends on the value of the index @xmath72 which labels the number of transversal modes in the billiard [ see eqs . ( 11 - 12 ) ] .",
    "an unperturbed state specified by a large @xmath72 ( an @xmath72 close to @xmath277 , for any @xmath71 ) shows a strong coupling to several other unperturbed states .",
    "in contrast , a state with @xmath97 ( for any @xmath71 ) shows practically no coupling to other states .",
    "we can see then that the extremely localized states , corresponding to the first position on the left hand side of each set of points in fig .",
    "16 occur because of the negligible coupling of the diagonal elements of the @xmath244 matrix with @xmath97 .",
    "similarly , the states on the second position ( on the left hand side ) occur when @xmath278 , and so on with odd @xmath72 .",
    "states on the right hand side of each set of points result from elements of the @xmath244 matrix with even values of @xmath72 .",
    "this structure prevails for all energies due to the existence of unperturbed @xmath97 states .",
    "however , the intervals between the occurence of @xmath97 unperturbed states increase as the energy increases . even as the semiclassical limit is approached , extremely localized states will appear , except less and less frequent . consequently the strong fluctuations appearing in the ses and ldos distributions ( figs . 10 and 11 ) will tend to dissapear .",
    "the quantum - classical correspondence for the chaotic motion of an electron in a periodic billiard was analyzed in terms of the classical analogues of the structure of eigenstates ( ses ) and local density of states ( ldos ) .    to construct the classical counterparts of the ldos and ses , we first changed ( _ via _ a canonical transformation ) to some new curvilinear coordinates , where the new hamiltonian incorporated the effects of the boundary into an effective interaction potential .",
    "then the original system of a free particle colliding within a 2d rippled channel becomes equivalent to a 1d model of two interacting `` particles '' , identified with the new coordinates .",
    "this procedure allowed us to study the chaotic properties of this system , using tools developed recently to analyze the role that interactions between particles play in the onset of quantum chaos .",
    "this example is quite instructive since it shows the relevance of  one - body chaos \" , which is due to an external potential ( or boundary conditions ) , to  two - body chaos \" , which results entirely from the interaction between particles .",
    "so far , these two mechanisms for producing chaos have been treated completely independently .    using this approach",
    ", we found that in the case of strong chaos , the classical analogs of ses and ldos agreed remarkably well with the global shapes of the quantum quantities .",
    "this correspondence enabled us to explain the main features of the ses and ldos in terms of the underlying classical motion of the system .",
    "specifically , we found that classical unstable and stable periodic orbits of period - one give rise to the two pronounced side - band peaks observed in the ses and ldos .    on the other hand",
    ", we found that the statistical properties of eigenstates and individual ldos differ qualitatively from those prescribed by the standard random matrix theory .",
    "namely , in the case of strong chaos and deep in the semiclassical region ( high energy ) , one expects the components of individual eigenstates to fluctuate in a statistically independent way around the mean , the envelope of the ses in the unperturbed energy basis .",
    "this expectation was confirmed when studying the structure of eigenstates of complex atoms and nuclei in the mean - field basis @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we have found that in our present model the deviations turn out to be extremely strong and not fully statistically independent .",
    "+ in connection with this , a detailed analysis revealed quite unexpected regularities in localization measures ( such as the inverse participation ratio ) characterizing the eigenstates and individual ldos .",
    "we remark that these regularities do not disappear as energy increases .",
    "in particular , even for high energies , one can find eigenstates that are strongly localized in the unperturbed energy representation ( _ i.e. _ , slightly perturbed plane waves ) .",
    "this occurs because energy is not the only semiclassical parameter in a 2d electron waveguide .",
    "clearly , two unperturbed states of similar ( or equal ) energy values but different transverse mode numbers will react differently to a small perturbation.that is , in contrast to high - mode unperturbed states , the transverse wavelength @xmath238 for low - mode states can be many times larger than the amplitude of the perturbation and hence will remain essentially unperturbed .",
    "+ thus , for any value of energy ( equivalently , for any small value of @xmath281 ) , there are _ non - ergodic states_. it should be stressed that here we are discussing the ergodicity in the energy shell , which is determined by the classical motion of a particle in terms of the classical ses .",
    "since the width of the energy shell is always finite due to the finite range of the interaction , the ergodicity of an eigenstate means that this eigenstate fills the whole energy shell with random ( gaussian ) fluctuations of its components around the smooth energy dependence defined by the classical ses .",
    "naturally , with an increase of the energy , the _ relative _ number of localized ( in the energy shell ) eigenstates tends to zero . in this sense",
    ", there is no contradiction with the onset of quantum ergodicity in the classical limit .",
    "however , this limit turns out to be achieved very slowly .",
    "therefore , we remark that from a physical point of view , it is important to further the study of the statistical properties of eigenstates in the deep semiclassical regime , which may be different from those in the strictly classical limit ( @xmath282 , a mathematical concept ) .",
    "we acknowledge support from conacyt ( mexico ) grant no .",

    "then we equate the average @xmath288 with the energy - ordered level @xmath67 .",
    "the approximation consists in assuming that the particle collissions with the top boundary take place always al @xmath289 but that the direction of reflection is given by the slope of the ripple at @xmath107 .",
