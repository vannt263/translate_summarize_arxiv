    "modifying gravity on large scales is one of the plausible ways of explaining the recent acceleration of the expansion of the universe . so far",
    ", the construction of valid models of modified gravity has been fraught with difficulties .",
    "the most serious one is already present in the original pauli - fierz formulation of massive gravity @xcite and involves the existence of a ghost in curved backgrounds .",
    "this phenomenon seems to be generic as suggested by ostrograski s theorem@xcite which states that higher derivative theories have a hamiltonian which is unbounded from below .",
    "higher dimensional versions of modified gravity such as the dgp model @xcite also suffer from the presence of a ghost in their spectrum at low energy .",
    "this problem is nicely avoided in @xmath2 models @xcite which turn out to be equivalent to a particular type of scalar - tensor theories @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the compatibility with solar system and laboratory tests of gravity is not straightforward and can only be achieved thanks to the so - called chameleon mechanism @xcite .",
    "indeed , the existence of a nearly massless scalar field on cosmological scales could jeopardize gravity locally .",
    "this issue is common to all known models of dark energy coupled to matter @xcite . in a large class of dark energy models involving a linear coupling to matter and a non - linear potential , the chameleon mechanism ,",
    "whereby the scalar field mass becomes dependent on the ambient environment , would be sufficient to hide away the dark energy field locally .",
    "similarly , in models of gravity such as the dgp or galileon @xcite theories for which a shift symmetry only allow for non - linearities in the scalar field kinetic terms , the vainshtein mechanism @xcite can be at play and prevent the existence of a fifth force locally . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on a different type of models involving a scalar field .",
    "these models are inspired from the string dilaton in the strong coupling regime  @xcite .",
    "their gravitational validity relies on an environmentally dependent form of the damour - polyakov mechanism @xcite whereby the coupling to matter is driven to vanish cosmologically . here , the coupling to matter is negligible in dense regions and in the vicinity of dense bodies .",
    "this prevents the existence of a fifth force in galaxies .",
    "constraints on the parameter space of these models springing from local tests of gravity have already been obtained in @xcite . here",
    "we will study the cosmology of these models in the non - linear regime when structures form ( see @xcite for an analysis of the bispectrum of matter distribution in this model ) .",
    "this requires large computer simulations . as a result",
    ", we have access to non - linear properties of the dilaton models such as the non - linear power spectrum or the number of dark matter halos for a given mass . moreover we will be able to probe how much the local tests of gravity constrain large scale structure formation and deviations from general relativity .",
    "we find that the dilaton models differ from gr at most at the level of a few percent once the local ( i.e. solar  system ) constraints have been imposed . although possibly detectable in principle , observing such small deviations will be challenging in the near future .",

    "the modifications we have made follow the detailed prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite , and here we only give a brief description .",

    "as our modification to the default mlapm code is only in the scalar field part , we focus on tests of the scalar field solver and the fifth force only .",
    "the scalar field solver uses the nonlinear gauss - seidel relaxation scheme to compute @xmath85 , and an indicator that it works is to show that , given the initial guess of the solution that is very different from the true solution , the relaxation could produce the latter within a reasonable number of iterations .",

    "[ fig : force ] , which shows that the fifth force is much weaker than gravity .",
    "note that the degree of suppression of the fifth force is dependent on the value of @xmath44 : the larger @xmath44 is , the more the fifth force is suppressed .",
    "also , the fifth force is weaker in higher density regions ( where gravity is stronger ) than in lower density regions ( where gravity is weaker ) , showing a strong dependence on the environment .",
    "as the universe expands , the overall density decreases and the fifth force becomes stronger , which could be seen in the lower rows of fig .",
    "[ fig : force ] .",
    "if there is no suppression on the fifth force , then its strength should be [ eq : fifth_to_grav ] & = & times that of gravity @xcite . for comparison , in the lowest row ( @xmath108 )",

    "we can see that in the model with smaller @xmath44 ( the middle two columns ) eq .",
    "( [ eq : fifth_to_grav ] ) gives a relatively good description of the fifth force at least in some regions .",
    "but for the models with big @xmath44 ( the first and fourth columns ) the fifth force is strongly suppressed even today .    since @xmath85 determines the strength of the fifth force [ cf .",

    "[ fig : beta ] shows the values of @xmath85 as a function of position in the same slices as fig .",
    "[ fig : force ] .",
    "as expected , at very early times ( @xmath110 ) @xmath111 because the fifth force is strongly suppressed .",
    "as the universe expands , @xmath85 increases ( the colour on the points becomes blue rather than black ) , but in the high density regions @xmath85 remains very small .",
    "also , for the models with big @xmath44 ( the first and fourth columns ) the values of @xmath85 in high and low density regions tend to have stronger contrast , showing stronger environment - dependence .",
    "this is clearer in the third row , which shows the result at @xmath112 .",
    "this is consistent with what we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : force ] .",
    "the nonlinear matter power spectrum is an important structure formation observable and could be used to distinguish amongst different structure formation scenarios . in ref .  @xcite it has been shown that the growth rate of linear matter density perturbations in the dilaton model differs from that of @xmath1cdm only slightly , and therefore the dilaton model ( with its parameters constrained by solar system tests ) does not deviate at more than the percent level from @xmath1cdm in practice . on the other hand ,",
    "the fifth force in the dilaton model has a finite range and is expected to only take effect on the scales of galaxy clusters ( @xmath113(mpc ) ) and smaller , which already fall into the nonlinear regime .",
    "we are therefore interested in seeing how the fifth force affects the growth of density perturbations on these scales .",
    "[ fig : power ] displays the fractional difference of the dilaton nonlinear matter power spectrum from that of the @xmath1cdm model , defined as @xmath114 . from this",
    "we can see that the difference is strongly suppressed even on small scales where the fifth force is expected to take effect .",
    "this is different from the linear perturbation prediction of @xcite ( c.f .",
    "fig .  3 therein ) , which shows that the growth rate of density perturbation on small scales is significantly higher than that on large scales .",
    "the reason for this is that by linearising the scalar field equation , the nonlinearity of the dilaton model , which is the very mechanism that suppresses the fifth force in high density regions , is artificially removed ( at least partially ) , and the strength of the fifth force is determined by the average , instead of the local , matter density .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0-body simulation overcomes this problem by taking full account of the suppression of the fifth force .",
    "the results indicate that it is even more difficult to use the nonlinear matter power spectrum to constrain the dilaton model or distinguish it from @xmath1cdm as the differences to the @xmath1cdm power spectrum are only a few percent on very small length scales at late times .",
    "the halo mass function is another key structure formation observable .",
    "it is defined to be the number density of dark matter halos within a given mass range .",
    "clearly , in case of a fifth force which could boost the clustering of matter , we expect more halos to form . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mf ] we have shown the mass functions of the dilaton models compared with that of @xmath1cdm , at @xmath115 . although the dilaton models do have higher mass functions than @xmath1cdm , especially for small halos which generally live in low - density regions where the fifth force is less suppressed , the differences are again very small , making all these models hard to distinguish in practice at present and a challenge for future surveys .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] we show the profile of @xmath85 inside the dark matter halos , which are assumed to be spherical . because @xmath85 characterises the strength of the fifth force",
    ", this can also provide information about the fifth force in halos .",
    "we have selected three halos with different masses ( respectively @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 solar mass ) to check the results .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] , @xmath85 ( and thus the strength of the fifth force ) increases from inner to outer regions of the halos as the matter density is highest and the fifth force most severely suppressed in the central region .",
    "furthermore , the fifth force is stronger for smaller halos , because those generally reside in low - density regions where the fifth force is less suppressed .",
    "however , for all these selected halos @xmath85 is at most @xmath119 and typically less than @xmath120 except near the halo edge , which mean that well inside the halos ( such as where the solar system is ) the fifth force is much weaker than gravity and has negligible effects ( and we have not even included baryons in the simulations , which are generally much denser than dark matter in galaxies ) .",
    "the results are consistent with what we have seen in the nonlinear matter power spectra and mass functions , all of them showing that the fifth force has little influence in the structure formation of the dilaton models ( as long as solar system tests are passed ) .",
    "the dilaton model of @xcite is an interesting alternative to the chameleon models with a different mechanism by which the fifth force produced by a coupling between matter and scalar field(s ) could be suppressed in high density regions .",
    "the theory therefore evades all solar system constraints while at the same time leaving open the possibility of significant effects on cosmological scales .",
    "the dilaton model has the advantage of being motivated from fundamental string theory .",
    "given the parameter space allowed by local experiments , we have found that the effects of the fifth force on linear - perturbation evolution is weak .",
    "here we have studied the possible imprints on the nonlinear evolution of large - scale structure using @xmath0-body simulations .    by solving the whole nonlinear equation instead of using linearisation",
    ", @xmath0-body simulations could fully capture the environment - dependence of the ( scalar ) dilaton field , and our results confirm the expectation that the high matter density in galaxy clusters strongly suppresses the strength of the fifth force .",
    "consequently , the key cosmological observables such as the nonlinear matter power spectrum and mass function of the dilaton model are even closer to the corresponding @xmath1cdm predictions than that suggested by the linear perturbation analysis .",
