    "one of the intriguing issues is not only to describe the late - time accelerated expansion of our universe but also to explain the smooth transition from decelerating phase to accelerating one . in the context of einstein theory of general relativity",

    "so , in the ordinary friedmann equation , the energy density is assumed to be positive while the pressure is negative .",
    "even more @xmath3 can be required to compensate the effect of ordinary matters in our universe . in some sense , it implies that the state parameter may depend on time and make it possible to explain the transition from decelerating phase to accelerating one . in the quintessence model based on supergravity or m / string theory ,",
    "the transition has been studied in terms of the numerical simulation @xcite .    on the other hand , a two - dimensional dilaton gravity may be useful in studying the transition from the decelerated phase and the accelerated phase because there are fewer degrees of freedom rather than the four - dimensional counterpart .",
    "furthermore , there exist exactly soluble models semiclassically @xcite , whose quantum back reactions of the geometry are easily treated so that various cosmological problems have been studied in refs .",
    "however , in even this semiclassically soluble gravity , it is difficult to realize the smooth phase transition because the solution shows the only decelerating or accelerating behavior .",
    "recently , it has been shown that it is possible to obtain the transition from decelerating phase to accelerating one by assuming the modified poisson brackets @xcite corresponding to noncommutativity of fields @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the future singularity appears at finite time in this model , and the decelerated geometry has been patched by hand for the regularity .",
    "so , in this paper , we would like to study the smooth phase transition from the decelerated expansion to accelerated expansion without any curvature singularity in the bose - parker - peleg ( bpp ) model @xcite , which is one of the exactly soluble model semiclassically . in particular",
    ", even though the classical cosmological constant is not assumed , the initial state is asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) and the late time behavior of our universe is asymptotically de sitter ( ds ) .",

    "[ sec : mpb ] , we will take the modified poisson brackets instead of the conventional poisson algebra . under some conditions for integration constants",

    "we have shown that the phase changing transition from the ads to the ds phase is possible by assuming the modified poisson brackets to the semiclassical equations of motion in the bpp model .",

    "for example , if one considers the modified poisson brackets at the classical dilaton gravity , then the corresponding solution can be obtained , however , it is difficult to obtain the meaningful solution in spite of its complexity .",

    "the first order of hamiltonian equations of motion have been written in the form of the second order euler - lagrange equations of motion in order to show the explicit difference between the noncommutative case and the commutative case .",
    "then , the solutions are @xmath135 , @xmath136 , where @xmath137 and @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 are constants of integration .",
    "note that these are just modified classical solutions rather than the quantum - mechanical ones .",
    "the equation of state parameter is singular at a certain time as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] . in order for the phase transition from the ads ( @xmath142 ) to the ds universe @xmath143",
    ", the state parameter also changes its signature at a certain time , in our case at @xmath144 .",
    "in fact , there are two options satisfying this condition",
    ". if the energy density is always positive then the pressure should change its sign , however , in this model , the pressure is always negative , so that the energy density should change its sign .",
    "the latter case gives the singular behavior .",
    "of course , the quantum - mechanically induced energy density allows the negative value .",
    "one might wonder how to derive the nontrivial poisson brackets which are similar to the noncommutativity in string theory @xcite . in the string theory ,",
    "the noncommutative brackets between the coordinates are derived in the d - brane system applied in the constant external tensor field .",
    "this is a higher dimensional realization of the slowly moving point particle on the constant magnetic field .",
    "all of these systems can be interpreted as constraint systems @xcite , so we can expect our model may be a similar constraint system , however , it remains unsolved .",
