    "spontaneous creation of particles or charged pairs from an external gauge field or a curved spacetime is one of the most prominent phenomena in quantum field theory .",
    "a strong electric field produces pairs of charged particles and antiparticles , known as the schwinger mechanism @xcite .",
    "the more remarkable phenomenon is the emission of all species of particles from black holes , known as hawking radiation @xcite . under an influence of strong backgrounds",
    "the vacuum may spontaneously breakdown due to quantum fluctuations and virtual pairs can be separated either by the energy of the fields or the causality of spacetimes .",
    "an accelerating detector measures a thermal spectrum of the unruh temperature determined by the acceleration , known as the unruh effect.@xcite the spectrum and characteristics for these effects are summarized in table [ ta1 ] .",
    "heisenberg and euler found the one - loop effective action for an electron in a constant electromagnetic field@xcite and schwinger introduced the proper - time integral method to express the effective action in scalar and spinor quantum electrodynamics ( qed),@xcite which is now known as the heisenberg - euler or schwinger effective action .",
    "the most distinct feature of the heisenberg - euler or schwinger action is poles of the proper - time representation of the action in an electric field .",
    "thus , the one - loop effective action has not only the vacuum polarization ( the real part ) but also the vacuum persistence amplitude ( twice the imaginary part ) .",
    "the vacuum persistence amplitude is a consequence of spontaneous production of charged pairs from the dirac sea .",
    "notice that the schwinger effect is the particle - hole theory , in which virtual particles from the dirac sea tunnel through a tilted potential barrier due to the electric field , and does not include the coulomb attraction of pairs due to the homogeneity of produced pairs .",
    "in this paper we recapitulate the schwinger effect in curved spacetimes , such as a de sitter @xmath0 space , an anti - de sitter @xmath1 space , and an extremal or near - extremal reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole .",
    "one motivation for studying the schwinger effect in @xmath2 is to unveil the interplay between the maxwell theory as a @xmath3 gauge and the quantum gravity effect at one - loop level .",
    "another motivation to study qed in @xmath2 is the near - horizon geometry of a near - extremal black hole@xcite and the scalar @xmath4-wave in the nariai - geometry of a rotating black hole,@xcite which are summarized in table [ ta2 ] .",
    "further , it would be interesting to investigate whether charged black holes may have the schwinger effect different from hawking radiation .",
    "we also provide a thermal interpretation of the schwinger effect in @xmath5 , which has recently been introduced by cai and kim@xcite and is a qed analog of the unruh effect in @xmath5.@xcite the schwinger effect from an extremal rn black hole has the same spectrum as in @xmath6 since the near - horizon geometry of the extremal black hole is @xmath7 as shown in table [ ta2 ] . the schwinger formula from the extremal black hole is similarly given a thermal interpretation.@xcite interestingly , the schwinger effect from a near - extremal black hole is factorized into the schwinger formula in @xmath6 and that in @xmath8 with the acceleration of the surface gravity due to small non - extremality of black hole .",
