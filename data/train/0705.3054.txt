    "non - spherical mass loss is a key ingredient for understanding the roles of rotation , magnetic fields , and close binary interactions in various stages of stellar evolution .",
    "bipolar structure is common in nebulae surrounding evolved stars across the hr diagram , most notably in planetary nebulae ( balick & frank 2002 ) and in more massive hot stars like luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) .",
    "many bipolar nebulae have a dense torus or ring at their pinched waist where the polar lobes meet at the equator , as seen in prototypical objects like @xmath1  carinae ( smith et al .",
    "2002@xmath2 ) and in dramatic _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) images of planetary nebulae like mycn 18 ( sahai et al .",
    "1999 ) , ngc2346 , and ngc7027 ( latter et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "perhaps the most outstanding and familiar example of such equatorial structure is the inner ring around sn1987a ( plait et al .",
    "1995 ; burrows et al .  1995 ; crotts & heathcote 1991 ; crotts et al .",
    "1989 ) . in sn1987a as well as planetary nebulae ,",
    "the prevailing interpretation for the formation of these equatorial rings and bipolar nebulae has been that a fast low - density wind expands into an asymmetric slow dense wind from a previous red giant or supergiant phase ( e.g. , blondin & lundqvist 1993 ; martin & arnett 1995 ; collins et al.1999 ; frank & mellema 1994 ; frank 1999 ) .",
    "this requires that the slow wind had a strong equatorial density enhancement ( i.e. a disk ) that can be swept - up to form a ring , but the origin of this putative pre - existing disk is unclear , and evidence of them around red supergiants is non - existent .",
    "the formation of equatorial disks by single stars has been of continued interest to the be star community , since these stars are rapid rotators .",
    "b[e ] supergiants are suspected to be their high luminosity analogs ( e.g. , zickgraf et al .",
    "the wind - compressed disk model ( bjorkman & cassinelli 1993 ) suggests that rapidly rotating stars will form disks as material ejected at mid - latitudes is directed toward the equator . while such disks are inhibited in hot stars with line - driven winds because of the effects of gravity darkening and velocity - dependent forces ( owocki et al .",
    "1996 ; cranmer & owocki 1995 ) , wind compression may still operate in other circumstances .",
    "ignace et al .  (",
    "1996 ) suggested that cool stars may experience moderate compression , while smith & townsend ( 2007 ) propose that thin disks can form in continuum - driven lbv eruptions .",
    "changes in ionization with latitude on a gravity - darkened rotating star has been suggested to play a role in disk formation as well ( e.g. , lamers & pauldrach 1991 ; cure et al .",
    "however , any disk formation around cool stars requires rapid rotation much in excess of rotation rates expected for the distended envelopes of red giants and supergiants .",
    "indeed , collins et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimated that while in the red supergiant phase , the progenitor of sn1987a must have been rotating at @xmath30.3 of its critical breakup speed to produce the observed nebular morphology  which is impossible for normal single - star evolution  so they conclude that the red supergiant was most likely spun - up by swallowing a companion .",
    "thus , close binary interactions and mergers are often taken as potential sources of angular momentum to focus material toward the equator . magnetic fields may provide yet another avenue for the formation of equatorial disks or rings ( ud - doula & owocki 2002 ; washimi et al .",
    "1996 ; townsend & owocki 2005 ; matt & balick 2004 ) .",
    "the equatorial ring around sn1987a is quite unusual in that it really is a hollow ring and not just a limb - brightened shell or pinched waist of an hourglass .",
    "a virtual twin of sn1987a s equatorial ring has been discovered in the milky way : the ring around the blue supergiant sher 25 in ngc  3603 ( brandner et al .",
    "more recently , smith ( 2007 ) has suggested another twin of sn1987a s nebula around the galactic lbv candidate hd168625 .",
    "two other notable examples are the ringed planetary nebulae webo1 ( bond et al .",
    "2003 ) and suwt2 ( schuster & west 1976 ) .",
    "regardless of the nature of their central stars , these objects are similar in the unusually distinct ring morphology of their ejecta .",
    "to this class we add two more examples , both discovered in the carina nebula ( ngc 3372 ; see fig.1 ) .",
    "the discovery of the two ring nebulae described in this paper was made serendipitously during a narrowband imaging survey of the carina nebula , although these images are not shown here as they are of lesser quality than the magellan images described below .",
    "we surveyed the entire 2@xmath45@xmath54  area of the giant carina nebula on 2003 march 10 using several pointings with the 8192@xmath58192 pixel imager mosaic2 mounted at the prime focus of the ctio 4 m blanco telescope .",
    "this camera has a large 35@xmath64 field of view , which allowed us to efficiently survey the whole nebula using the [ o  iii ] @xmath75007 , h@xmath8+[n  ii ] , and [ s  ii ] @xmath96717,6731 narrowband filters , plus the @xmath10 broadband filter .",
    "further details of the observations and data reduction can be found in previous papers from the same project ( e.g. , smith et al.2004 , 2005@xmath2 ) .",
    "because we were trying to maximize efficient spatial coverage of the nebula in multiple filters , we did not do a full set of mosdither exposures to correct for the @xmath03interchip gaps .",
    "one of the objects of interest here ( sbw2 ) ended up straddling a gap , motivating the subsequent imaging with the 6.5 m magellan telescope described below .",
    "both nebulae were easily recognized as circumstellar rings in the h@xmath8+[n  ii ] filter images , but no circumstellar emission was seen in images in the other filters taken with similar 510 minute exposure times .",
    "the positions of these two ring nebulae are listed in table 1 , and their approximate locations are marked on the wide - field image in figure 1 .",
    "these absolute sky coordinates from the mosaic2 images were determined with reference to usno catalog stars .      following the initial discovery in ctio images , we obtained narrowband h@xmath8 images of the two carina ring nebulae on 2005 february 21 using the ccd imager magic mounted on the 6.5 m clay telescope of the magellan observatory .",
    "magic has a 2048@xmath52048 pixel site detector , with a spatial pixel scale of 0@xmath11069 and a 142@xmath5142  field of view on the 6.5 m clay telescope .",
    "the night was decidedly non - photometric with patchy and highly - variable cirrus , but the seeing was still quite good at @xmath00@xmath116 .",
    "sbw1 was bright enough to observe easily with a 6.5 m telescope looking through clouds , and we took a set of 3 exposures of 120 sec each .",
    "sbw2 is much fainter and while we observed it the cloud cover became more crippling , but with periodic thin patches .",
    "therefore , we took a long series of about 30 consecutive 300 s exposures as the clouds rolled by , and we selected only the highest - quality images ( the ones with the largest number of counts and best seeing ) to shift and add together .",
    "the small 0@xmath11069 pixels were rebinned by a factor of 3 to larger pixels of 0@xmath11207 .",
    "the final h@xmath8+[n  ii ] images of the two rings are shown in figure 2 , while intensity tracings through the middle of each ring are shown in figure 3 .",
    "we used the eso multi - mode instrument ( emmi ) on the ntt to obtain high resolution spectra of sbw1 and sbw2 on the nights of 2003 march 11 and 12 , respectively ( one and two nights after their discovery in ctio images ) .",
    "for both targets we used the number 10 echelle grating and emmi s red ccd with a 4096@xmath54096 pixel mit / ll detector , a pixel scale of 0@xmath11166@xmath50.058  , and @xmath12=@xmath7/@xmath13=28,000 ( 10 km s@xmath14 ) at wavelengths near h@xmath8 .",
    "we calibrated the wavelengths using an internal emission lamp .    for sbw1 , we used emmi in cross - dispersed mode , with a 15@xmath51  slit aperture , oriented at p.a.=45across the minor axis of the nebula ( see fig .",
    "4@xmath2 ) .",
    "sbw1 is in a region of bright nebular emission in the western carina nebula , so we also obtained similar exposures of an adjacent position offset by 30  se to subtract emission from the nebula and sky .",
    "the red [ s  ii ] @xmath96717,6731 doublet was faintly visible in the resulting spectra , but the signal to noise in the 30-minute exposure was too low to provide a meaninful measure of the electron density .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that we detected no extended structure in narrowband [ s  ii ] images .",
    "aside from h@xmath8 and [ n  ii ] , no other emission lines were detected in the nebula .",
    "the order including h@xmath8+[n  ii ] emission is shown in figure 5@xmath2 , while tracings of the spectrum through the ne and sw portions of the ring are shown in figure 5@xmath15 , and an extracted spectrum of the central star is shown in figure 5@xmath16 .",
    "detailed views of the long - slit kinematics for h@xmath8 and [ n  ii ] @xmath76583 are shown in figures 6@xmath2 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "for sbw2 , which has a larger size on the sky , we used a longer 6@xmath51  aperture , with a flat mirror in the beam instead of a cross - disperser , and we used a narrowband order - sorting filter to isolate h@xmath8+[n  ii ] .",
    "this long slit was also oriented at p.a.=45  through the minor axis of the ellipse ( fig .",
    "4@xmath15 ) .",
    "unfortunately , sbw2 was observed at the end of the night and had less than half much time as we would have liked , an the resulting signal to noise of the spectrum was much less than half of what this object deserved .",
    "the resulting spectrum is noisy and is not displayed here ( dominated by read noise , since it is in a region of very faint nebular background emission ; see fig .  1 ) .",
    "these spectra are useful , however , because although we detected the h@xmath8+[n  ii ] lines , we detected no doppler shifts from one side of the ring to the next .",
    "the limiting resolution of 10 km s@xmath14 for these data then imply a limiting intrinsic radial expansion speed of @xmath178 km s@xmath14 ( @xmath1716 km s@xmath14 across the diameter of the ring ) when corrected for the disk inclination angle ( see below ) .",
    "we used rc spec on the ctio 4 m to obtain medium - resolution ( r@xmath186,000 ) red spectra of sbw1 , sbw2 , and suwt2 on 2006 march 15 .",
    "rc spec is the cassegrain grating spectrograph on the v.m .",
    "blanco 4 m telescope , equipped with a loral 1k@xmath53k ccd detector .",
    "we used grating g380 and filter gg495 to sample wavelengths @xmath13=54807153  , with a pixel scale of 0@xmath115@xmath50.55  , and an effective 2-pixel spectral resolution of roughly 50 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the slit width was set at 0@xmath118 , matched approximately to the seeing , with the long slit oriented as in figure 4 for sbw1 and sbw2 , and along the major axis of the ring at p.a.=45  for suwt2 .",
    "we used total integration times of 9 min for sbw1 , and 40 min for sbw2 and suwt2 .",
    "the conditions were photometric , and the data were flux calibrated using observations of the spectrophotometric standards ltt3218 and ltt4816 .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed with reference to an internal henear lamp .",
    "emission from the background sky and h  ii region was subtracted by sampling nebular emission along the slit adjacent to each object .",
    "the extracted flux - calibrated spectra are shown in figure 7 , and line intensities for several emission lines relative to h@xmath8=100 are listed in table 2 .",
    "the relative line intensities in table 2 have been dereddened .",
    "a reddening of @xmath19=0.5 for sbw2 is a standard value for relatively unobscured regions in carina ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2005b ) , while we chose a higher value of @xmath19=1.0 for sbw1 , even though it too appears in carina , for reasons justified later in  3.1.2 .",
    "the value of @xmath19=0.25 for suwt2 was determined by matching the continuum shape of the central star in our spectra to an early a - type photosphere ( however , this value is very uncertain due to the small overall wavelength range of our red spectra ) .",
    "uncertainties are a few percent for the brightest lines , and several to 10% for the faintest lines . for sbw1 and sbw2",
    "we give upper limits to the intensity of [ n  ii ] @xmath75755 , since it is important for constraining the electron temperature and chemical abundances .    on 2006",
    "march 16 we also obtained a blue spectrum of the central star of sbw1 with rc spec on the ctio 4 m telescope in order to determine the spectral type of the central star .",
    "two 150-second exposures covering roughly 30006000   were obtained with the 0@xmath1167 slit along a position angle of about 10 .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard way , and emission from the sky and background h  ii region was subtracted by fitting background diffuse emission along the slit .",
    "figure 8 shows a normalized spectrum extracted from a @xmath01@xmath115 segment of the slit .      using the mosaic2 camera on the ctio 4 m telescope ( during the same survey of star - forming regions when we discovered sbw1 and sbw2 as noted earlier in  2.1 )",
    ", we also obtained an h@xmath8+[n  ii ] image of another ring nebula called suwt2 on the same night of 2003 march 10 .",
    "suwt2 was originally discovered on red photographic plates by schuster & west ( 1976 ) , but the new ccd image presented here ( fig .",
    "9 ) has greater sensitivity and was obtained in better seeing conditions with a narrow filter .",
    "the new image of suwt2 will be discussed in  5 .",
    "the ring nebula webo1 was first reported by bond et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who discussed its morphology in images and the properties of the central star .",
    "it was discovered independently on 1999 october 6 during our narrow - band imaging survey of nearby star - forming molecular clouds , seen on a wide - field narrow - band h@xmath8  image obtained with the 1  field - of - view mosaic ccd camera mounted on the kitt peak 0.9 meter telescope .",
    "this prompted us to obtain additional imaging and spectroscopy of webo1 .",
    "a deep h@xmath8  image was obtained at the f/10 nasmyth focus of the astrophysical research consortium ( arc ) 3.5 meter telescope at the apache point observatory near sunspot , new mexico , on 2001 september 25 using a 2048 @xmath5 2048 pixel ccd ( spicam ) with a 40 passband h@xmath8  filter and a total exposure time of 1160 seconds .",
    "the ccd was binned 2@xmath52 to provide a pixel scale of 0@xmath1122 .",
    "this image is shown in figure 10@xmath2 .",
    "low dispersion ( r = 500 ) spectra were then obtained on 2001 september 26 with the dual - channel imaging spectrometer ( dis ) at the 3.5 meter telescope , using a 0@xmath119 slit width .",
    "the slit was oriented along the major axis of the ring as indicated in figure 10@xmath2 , and included the light of the two brightest stars located in the ring interior .",
    "the resulting spectrum of the northern portion of the ring is shown in figure 10@xmath15 .",
    "additionally , a high - resolution ( r = 20,000 ) spectrum , shown in figure 10@xmath16 , was obtained on 2000 december 18 with the hires spectrometer on the keck i telescope .",
    "the aperture traced the northern edge of the nebula with the slit aligned along the major axis of the ring .    finally , we searched for j = 10 co emission in a 10  diameter box using the 16 beam sequoia array at the 14 m diameter radio telescope at the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) near amherst massachusetts on 2001 january 6 .",
    "no emission was found at any velocity above an rms brightness temperature level of 0.3 k in 92 khz wide channels .",
    "sbw1 appears as a distinct , almost perfectly smooth elliptical nebula with a well - defined outer edge in figure 2@xmath2 . with its bright central star",
    "it resembles a wide - open staring eye , lidless and wreathed in flame , probably deserving a nickname like the `` eye of sauron '' nebula ; later in this paper we will discuss its relation to the other rings .",
    "this ring is brightest at its southeast and northwest apexes , due to limb - brightening , and the interior of the ring is partially filled - in with diffuse emission .",
    "figure 3@xmath2 shows an intensity tracing through the minor axis of the nebula , along with a model of the expected emission for a slice through a limb - brightened shell where the inner and outer radii listed in the figure give the best fit to the intensity of the edges of the nebula .",
    "clearly it is plausible that additional emission fills its center  however , the kinematics of this nebula are unusual , as discussed below .",
    "the outer limb - brightened edge of the equatorial ring allows us to measure its geometric parameters accurately .",
    "the major axis of the ring is 11@xmath111@xmath170@xmath111 , while the minor axis is 7@xmath111@xmath170@xmath111 .",
    "this yields an inclination of @xmath10=50@xmath42@xmath171  if the ring is circular . the polar axis ( corresponding to the direction of the minor axis on the sky ) lies at p.a.=32@xmath44@xmath171 .",
    "the intrinsic physical dimensions of the ring depend on the distance , which turns out to be somewhat surprising as discussed in  3.1.2 .",
    "faint but visible in figure 2@xmath2 are a set of outer rings , another few arcseconds to the northeast and southwest .",
    "these remind one of the fainter outer rings around sn1987a , although they do not have the same special magnificence , appearing very thin , like butter scraped over too much bread .",
    "they give the impression of limb - brightened edges of faint bipolar lobes above and below the equatorial plane defined by the brighter inclined ring .",
    "in fact , the image of sbw1 in figure 2@xmath2 resembles the sn1987a model image of martin & arnett ( 1995 ) more closely than sn1987a itself does .",
    "this might lead one to suspect that the true geometry of sbw1 is akin to that of the bipolar model of martin & arnett .",
    "an even more extended , and fainter third set of rings or polar lobes may be present as well  these are hard to see on the printed page because of the grayscale levels in figure 2@xmath2 , but their emission can be seen at @xmath179  from the star in the intensity tracing along the polar axis of the nebula in figure 3@xmath2 .",
    "deeper images may help reveal these putative outer rings , although they are nearly as faint as the fluctuations in the background nebula .",
    "high - resolution spectra of sbw1 in figures 5 and 6 clearly show extended nebular h@xmath8 and [ n  ii ] emission lines .",
    "the detailed kinematic structure of the emission along the slit shown in figure 6 is rather bizarre .",
    "the strongest emission at the position of the main ring is redshifted to the northeast , and blueshifted to the southwest .",
    "the faint emission that fills the ring s interior in images follows the same general trend , but the detailed kinematic structure shows a triangular shape above and below the star in figure 6 . the emission does not converge on the star at the central position , as would be expected for a hubble flow ( homologous expansion ) , but rather , meets the position of the star at @xmath1712 km s@xmath14 .",
    "we offer no obvious explanation for this strange kinematic structure , except that it is marginally consistent with the interior of the ring being filled with a steadily outflowing flared disk .",
    "the cause of the triangular kinematic shape may be geometric , such that the motion of material was initially ejected or subsequently diverted out of the equatorial plane to form a flaring ring . in that case",
    ", the centroid of this emission at @xmath1712 km s@xmath14 implies a radial expansion speed for the ring and disk of roughly 19@xmath172 km s@xmath14 when it is corrected for the inclination angle of 50@xmath42 .",
    "this expansion speed is identical to the radial expansion speeds of the rings around the blue supergiants sher 25 and hd168625 .",
    "figure 8 shows the spectrum of the central star of sbw1 , which exhibits a spectral type of b1.5 iab .",
    "the luminosity class is not entirely clear , because higher dispersion ( fig .",
    "5 ) shows that the balmer absorption lines are partially filled - in with nebular emission .",
    "the extracted spectrum of the bright central star in figure 5@xmath16 shows some nebular emission rising above the continuum level in h@xmath8 and double - peaked in the [ n  ii ] @xmath76583 line , superposed on a smooth continuum spectrum with prominent broad balmer absorption . despite the nebular contamination",
    ", a spectral type of b1.5 iab seems likely .",
    "the luminosity class has two important ramifications concerning implications for stellar evolution , as well as the distance to sbw1 .",
    "first , it means that the central star is a massive star with an initial mass of roughly 1825 m@xmath20 , and the ring is therefore an example of a pre - supernova environment much like that around sn1987a .",
    "the spectral type of b1.5 iab justifies a close comparison to both sher 25 ( b1.5 ia ; moffat 1983 ) and the progenitor of sn1987a ( b3 i ; walborn et al .",
    "1989 ) , as well as permitting a link to the b[e ] supergiants because of the emission line spectrum ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "second , the high luminosity suggests a distance much larger than 2.3 kpc , meaning that it is seen through the carina nebula and is projected within its boundaries only by chance , as if it wants to be found there .",
    "the absolute visual magnitude of a b1.5 iab supergiant should be about @xmath217.0 ( crowther et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the observed visual magnitude is roughly m@xmath22=12.7 ( table 1 ) . if sbw1 were located at 2.3 kpc in the carina nebula , the required total line - of - sight extinction would be very large at a@xmath237.9 magnitudes .",
    "such high extinction is plausible , at least in principle , since sbw1 is seen along the same sight - line as dense molecular gas and dust associated with the carina nebula ( zhang et al .",
    "2001 ; grabelsky et al .",
    "1988 ; smith et al .",
    "2000 ) . however , the 2mass colors ( @xmath24=10.55 , @xmath25=10.18 , and @xmath26=9.95 ) suggest that the visual extinction is more like 3 - 5 magnitudes , depending on the extinction law .",
    "this implies that the star appears faint for its luminosity class because it is actually at a much farther distance .",
    "in fact , the observed radial velocity of sbw1 also implies a much larger kinematic distance that places it in the far carina arm . the systemic velocity in figure 6 is redshifted from the centroid of nebular emission in carina by roughly + 30 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath1 carinae and the carina nebula is 8.1 km s@xmath14 ( smith 2004 ) , but that of sbw1 is + 22@xmath174 km s@xmath14 , or an lsr velocity of roughly 10@xmath174 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the carina nebula is seen near the tangent of the sagittarius - carina spiral arm ( e.g. , bok 1959 ) , and a positive radial velocity at its position places sbw1 outside the solar circle on the far side of the milky way .",
    "the corresponding distance at a longitude of @xmath27=287  for a flat rotation curve is @xmath07 kpc .",
    "images and long slit spectra that the ring may be seen in silhouette against the background nebular emission .",
    "if true , this would mean that sbw1 must be located within the carina nebula after all and that its radial velocity is anomalous , unless there is another h  ii region projected behind carina .",
    "higher signal to noise data of the same type or possibly uv spectroscopy of absorption line profiles to the star may resolve this ambiguity .",
    "if sbw1 is far beyond carina , the far ( receding ) side of the h  ii region should be seen in absorption .",
    "thus , there are still questions that need answering . ]",
    "this larger distance joins sbw1 to a string of other famous hot supergiants with circumstellar nebulae in the far carina arm , seen on either side of the carina nebula , such as sher  25 in ngc3603 , ag  carinae , hen  3 - 519 , and hr  carinae .",
    "the massive cluster westerlund 1 is also thought to be at a similar distance in this part of the galactic plane .",
    "sbw1 is less conspicuous than these stars and its ring has not been discovered until now because of its much higher extinction column along its line of sight through dust and gas in the carina nebula , or perhaps , simply because it is overshadowed by other spectacular objects in the brighter inner parts of the nebula . at 7 kpc ,",
    "the required extinction for its apparent magnitude is roughly 5 magnitudes .",
    "this is in much better agreement with the extinction implied by near - ir photometry as noted above .",
    "also , the larger distance of 7 kpc means that the ring s radius is about 0.19 pc  almost identical to the rings around sn1987a and sher  25 . with a radial expansion speed of 19 km s@xmath14 ,",
    "its dynamical age is @xmath010@xmath28 yr .",
    "this age , too , is comparable to the rings around sn1987a and sher  25 .",
    "its high luminosity and circumstellar ring make sbw1 an object of considerable interest , and its similarity to the equatorial ring around sn1987a hints at some things which have not yet come to pass .",
    "the central star deserves further observations and analysis , such as monitoring for photometric and spectroscopic variability ( i.e. is it an eclipsing or spectroscopic binary ? ) , as well as detailed atmospheric spectral analysis to accurately determine its physical parameters .",
    "this is important if sbw1 is a potential supernova progenitor .",
    "table 2 lists line intensities for sbw1 , corrected for a reddening value of @xmath19=1 that would correspond to our estimate of @xmath295 , adopting the value of @xmath12=4.8 that is appropriate for extinction in the direction of carina ( e.g. , smith 2002 ) . from the red [ s  ii ] @xmath96717,6731 doublet , we measure an electron density of n@xmath30=513 @xmath31 , and from the ratio [ n  ii ] @xmath76548+@xmath76583/@xmath75755 we find an upper limit to the electron temperature of t@xmath3212,350 k. in the extracted emmi spectrum of the nebula ( fig .",
    "5@xmath15 ) we measure a [ n  ii ] @xmath76583/h@xmath8 intensity ratio of 0.483 , which is within a few percent of the value we measure from rc spec data .",

    "this lack of distinct nitrogen enrichment implies that sbw1 _ has not yet passed through a red supergiant phase _ , much like its twin sher 25 ( smartt et al .",

    "it is also comparable to the mass for the rings around ry scuti ( smith et al .",
    ".    it would be interesting to measure the thermal - infrared flux from sbw1 , in order to measure its dust mass .",
    "our long - slit spectra obtained with rc spec hint that significant dust may be present in the nebula , since it is apparently seen in silhouette , blocking light from the background nebula in some emission lines ( the low signal to noise and foreground emission preclude an accurate estimate of the dust mass , however ) .",
    "the structure of sbw2 is far less orderly than sbw1 .",
    "it is much fainter , more diffuse and ratty - looking , less symmetric , and it lacks a clear outer edge .",
    "the most unnatural and curious property , however , is that there is no obvious bright star near its center .",
    "there are three faint stars inside the ring ( with @xmath3818.5 , 20.5 , and 20.7 mag ) , as well as a few extremely faint stars that are scarcely detected in our magellan image with @xmath12 of about 26 to 27 .",
    "however , none of these stars is at the ring s center , and none stands out as an obvious candidate for a central star that may have ejected it .",
    "the sound crossing time of the ring is only a few tens of thousands of years .",
    "any white dwarf at that young age should be several magnitudes brighter at visual wavelengths than these stars ( e.g. , bergeron et al .",
    "1995 ) if sbw2 is within the carina nebula at 2.3 kpc .",
    "thus , the central star in sbw2 might avoid being seen if it were older , but to disappear entirely , that is a rare gift . is the central object completely obscured by its own dust ?",
    "probably not , as we should see the outside of such an envelope ionized by whatever ionizes the rest of the ring .",
    "perhaps the most likely  if unsatisfying  explanation is that a tight binary system was disrupted when one of the stars shed a large fraction of the system s mass .",
    "the origin of the ring and its invisible star system has since passed out of all knowledge , but proper motions of stars in the surrounding field may be quite illuminating .",
    "the purpose of the intensity tracing in figure 3@xmath15 is to illustrate that sbw2 is not a limb - brightened spheroidal shell , but an actual flattened ring with a cleared interior .",
    "the intensity tracing through the minor axis of the nebula shows that the brightness in the middle of the ring drops to roughly zero . on the other hand ,",
    "the dotted line in figure 3@xmath15 shows a model of the brightness distribution we would expect for a limb - brightened shell with a thickness corresponding to the apparent ring thickness in images .",
    "it is clear that the central region of the nebula would be more filled - in if it were a limb - brightened shell , unless the ring were much thinner than observed .",
    "thus , the morphology of sbw2 is that of a flattened equatorial ring with a hollow center , titled at an inclination angle of about 52 .",
    "the average radius of the ring is 19@xmath118 , or 0.22 pc if it is in the carina nebula at 2.3 kpc .",
    "this makes its average radius only 10% larger than the equatorial ring around sn1987a ( the inner and outer radii of sbw2 are roughly 0.16 and 0.25 pc , respectively ) .",
    "another unusual or unexpected property of sbw2 is that the brightest parts of the ring are not at the southeast and northwest tangent points along the major axis , as would be expected from limb - brightening in an optically - thin ring like sbw1 .",
    "in fact , the brightness distribution is the opposite  the brightest parts of sbw2 are the near and far sides along the _ minor _ axis .",
    "this points to a high degree of azimuthal asymmetry in the system , perhaps implying that an eccentric binary system played a role in shaping the ejecta .",
    "although sbw2 is projected within the boundaries of the star - forming carina nebula , it is unlikely that this is a normal pre - main - sequence circumstellar envelope . in our experience ,",
    "no pre - ms stars or protostars are surrounded by circumstellar disks that look anything like sbw2 .",

    "this link , in turn , would suggest that in the massive ringed stars in our sample , rapid rotation rather than close binary evolution may shape their ejecta .",
    "both sher 25 and hd168625 have been studied , and no evidence for binarity has yet been reported , although renewed efforts would be of great interest .",
    "sbw1 should also be monitored to search for eclipses or radial velocity variations .",
    "both sher 25 and sbw1 are luminous hot supergiants that probably have _ not _ gone through a rsg phase , as noted earlier , while hd168625 is a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) candidate .",
    "thus , the most plausible scenario for the formation of their rings is ejection by a rapidly - rotating star in an lbv eruption or some related episodic mass loss as blue supergiants ( see smith 2007 ; smith & townsend 2007 ) . in this context , the fact that their nebulae are near twins of sn1987a is quite suggestive .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the presence of descrete rings  as opposed to smooth thin disks  is evidence for recent temporal variability of the central star in each object , regardless of the specific interpretation for their formation .",
    "the presence of a ring requires either 1 ) a brief ejection episode as a blue supergiant , b[e ] star , or lbv , where @xmath60 increased drastically for a short time , or 2 ) the initial formation of a thin disk over a long timescale , which is then swept up into a ring following a sharp increase in the speed of the stellar wind .",
    "both these mechanisms would require that the ejection of rings is a consequence of late stages of stellar evolution , rather than normal main - sequence evolution .    in the context of linking spatially - resolved rings to b[e ] supergiants , ry scuti ( smith et al .",
    "2002b ) is perhaps one of the most interesting objects available for detailed study .",
    "it has a toroidal nebula , it shares many spectroscopic properties in common with the b[e ] supergiants ( menshchikov & miroshnichenko 2005 ; allen & swings 1976 ; smith et al .",
    "1999 ) , and it is an eclipsing binary in a state of overcontact that is known to be shedding mass and angular momentum .",
    "its rings have a radius of 10002000 au  in between the expected radii of emitting circumstellar material around b[e ] stars ( a few to several hundred au ) and most of the spatially - resolved rings discussed here at radii of a few @xmath510@xmath28 au . the dust mass and ir excess of ry scuti are similar to b[e ] supergiants , although the grains are at a lower temperature around ry scuti because they are farther from the star .",
    "the @xmath040 km s@xmath14 expansion speed of its rings ( smith et al .",
    "2002 ) is typical of the narrow - line regions around b[e ] stars ( zickgraf et al .",
    "1986 ) , but faster than the speeds of the more extended rings discussed in this paper , which have presumably decelerated .",
    "thus , ry scuti may represent a very short - lived `` missing link '' between the b[e ] supergiants and the early b supergiants surrounded by rings .",
    "the sample of objects in table 3 may yield interesting clues to the role of close binary interactions in the formation mechanism of circumstellar rings .",
    "six of the nine objects are known to be or suspected to be close interacting binaries .",
    "ry scuti , suwt2 , and he2 - 147 are definite eclipsing binaries , while the central star of webo1 is a barium star that probably resulted from mass transfer in a roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) phase ( bond et al .",
    "the remaining two suspected binaries are somewhat unusual cases : sn1987a is thought to have undergone a binary merger event when the ring was ejected , as noted in  1 ( although there may be problems with the merger interpretation ; smith 2007 ; smith & townsend 2007 ) .",
    "the invisible central star in the sbw2 ring probably requires that a central binary system was disrupted and that the stars were ejected from the system , as discussed earlier in  3.2 .",
    "taken together , this collection of objects strongly suggests that mass loss through the outer lagrangian point in a common - envelope / rlof phase of close binary evolution is a preferred avenue for the forging of rings , at least for intermediate - mass systems .",
    "there are good reasons why more luminous massive stars can produce rings without close binary influence ( smith & townsend 2007 ) .",
    "ry scuti is a key object in this regard , as it is currently caught in this brief but important rlof phase and it is the only confirmed binary among the supergiants with rings . in a scenario where a massive star has a companion close enough and massive enough to shape its ejecta , it would be difficult for that companion to escape detection .",
    "forging of such rings through close binary interaction may be relevant for the formation of bipolar planetary nebulae if a fast wind expands into such an environment with a strong equatorial density enhancement .",
    "some of the most tightly - pinched waists among bipolar planetary nebulae are seen in so - called symbiotic pne , and several of these are strongly suspected to be binaries ( e.g. , m 2 - 9 [ doyle et al .",
    "2000 ] ; mz  3 [ smith 2003 ] ; hb12 [ hsia et al .  2006 ] ) .",
    "however , several of the objects we discuss here are equatorial rings that are suspected to be present _ before _ the planetary nebula phase , and are only seen in rare circumstances as discussed next .      two - thirds of the objects in table 3 ( the two new objects discovered here , plus sn1987a , sher 25 , hd168625 , and webo1 ) are seen projected in or near giant h  ii regions  environments that may provide a copious external source of uv photons ( admittedly , the nebula of sn1987a was flash ionized by the supernova event itself ) .",
    "ry scuti has a sufficiently hot and luminous star to provide its own uv illumination .",
    "sbw2 in carina has no bright central star , but we have shown earlier that the hot stars that power the carina nebula can supply sufficient ionizing photons .",
    "suwt2 , with two a - type stars , may have a similar problem , with a nearby early b star providing a similar solution .",
    "webo1 is near w4 and the x - ray binary ls i + 61303 .",
    "this raises the question of whether such rings around post - ms stars might be fairly common , but go unseen where there is a lack of favorable external illumination .",
    "such precious rings may be the long sought - after doughnuts ( e.g. , frank et al .",
    "1998 ) needed for the interacting winds scenario of bipolar planetary nebula formation .",
    "even if external ionization is not critical in making these rings visible , the fact that most of them are seen in close proximity to h  ii regions certainly increases their chances for serendipitous discovery .",
    "this suggests that there may be many more rings of similar size and morphology surrounding post - ms intermediate - mass stars throughout the galaxy , but they go undetected either because they are not illuminated or because most of the galactic plane has not been surveyed with deep narrowband imaging as intensively as star - forming regions have been . excluding the more massive stars in our sample , which may supply their own ionization and are probably found preferentially near h  ii regions anyway , we can make an order of magnitude extrapolation .",
    "h  ii regions occupy only 0.11% of the volume of the galactic disk , so there may be several hundred to a few thousand more dark rings in the galaxy , comparable to the known number of planetary nebulae .",
    "this estimate is probably conservative , since not all galactic h  ii regions have been surveyed in detail .",
    "thus , it is at least plausible that such a population of undetected rings could exist , and that these could play a role in binding the waists of bipolar planetary nebulae .",
    "thus , such rings may partly answer the question `` where s the doughnut '' posed by frank et al .",
    "the discovery of the ring in sbw1 is the most interesting result of this study , because it adds to the small number of such rings known around blue supergiants that are likely supernova progenitors .",
    "in particular , the radius and morphology of the ring in sbw1 make it nearly identical to the equatorial ring around sn1987a , and the luminosity and spectral type of the central star are almost identical to sk@xmath2169202 .",
    "the other two b supergiants with similar ring nebulae , sher 25 and hd  168625 , are both significantly more luminous than sk@xmath2169202 .",
    "the low n abundance in sbw1 , however , is surprising because it means that the star has not yet been a rsg , and so hot supergiants must be able to eject rings like this without a slow / fast interacting wind scenario .",
    "one intriguing possibility is that these rings correspond to older phases of ejected material that would have initially been seen closer to the star as a b[e ] supergiant .",
    "if ir excess emission were detected in sbw1 , it would add weight to this idea since b[e ] supergiants have dusty disks or tori .",
    "the same may be true for sher 25 , hd168625 , and the progenitor of sn1987a , while the much smaller radius rings around ry scuti may suggest that it is in an intermediate phase .",
    "sbw1 should be monitored photometrically and spectroscopically to determine if it is a close binary system .      in all respects , except for the troublesome fact that its central star is missing",
    ", sbw2 is a carbon copy of suwt2 and webo1 .",
    "these rings are associated with intermediate - mass ( 2 - 8 m@xmath20 ) close binary stars .",
    "their rings appear thicker and more diffuse , with inner edges that are sharper than their outer limits , as compared to the more elegant equatorial rings around the blue supergiant stars .",
    "their radii around 0.2  pc are oddly similar to those surrounding the more massive stars .",
    "they all seem to be nitrogen rich , with [ n  ii ] @xmath76583 much brighter than h@xmath8 .",
    "all seem to lack a suitable source of ionizing photons , unless a hot white dwarf has gone undetected in each system .",
    "we have suggested that the lack of any bright central star in sbw2 may indicate that a binary system has been distrupted , which would be quite extraordinary , while the remaining rings in the intermediate - mass class all seem to be close binaries .",
    "thus , in contrast to the massive stars with rings , at low / intermediate mass it seems more likely that close binary evolution rather than rapid rotation of single stars governs the forging of these rings . if they are detected only in these few cases because of selection effects or favorable ionization , such rings may be numerous in the galaxy .",
    "as such , they could provide the pre - existing equatorial density enhancements needed to form bipolar nebulae through the interacting winds scenario .",
    "we thank steve lawrence for kindly obtaining the blue spectrum of sbw1 for us , and nolan walborn for advice on its spectral type .",
    "we also thank jon morse for assistance on the magellan observing run and bo reipurth for assistance with the keck run .",
