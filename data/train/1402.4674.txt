    "atoms in highly excited states , rydberg atoms , exhibit strong and long - range interactions combined with long lifetimes .",
    "due to strong interaction induced level shifts , driving these atoms with coherent laser fields ( for example under electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) conditions ) gives rise to strong optical nonlinearities  @xcite .",
    "these nonlinearities can be exploited to engineer non - classical states of light @xcite , to produce entangled states of single photons and atomic excitations @xcite , to introduce interactions between photons in an atomic medium @xcite , or to observe sub - poissonian statistics of dark - state polaritons @xcite .",
    "the theoretical modeling of ensembles of long - range interacting particles coherently interacting with light fields far from equilibrium turns out to be quite challenging .",
    "mean field models fail quickly as the atomic density increases , and due to the exponentially growing hilbert space , exact treatments are limited to small atom numbers @xcite . in the eit configuration , where the rydberg level is accessed via a resonantly coupled intermediate level , incoherent processes such as the spontaneous decay of the intermediate level are crucial and make a full master equation ( me ) treatment necessary .",
    "various approaches have been pursued to tackle this problem @xcite , one of them being the so called rate equation ( re ) approach @xcite .",
    "this approach may be used to calculate the steady state of a cloud of two- or three - level atoms subject to near resonant laser driving by adiabatic elimination of all coherences and including interactions as level shifts of the rydberg level of individual atoms .",
    "this classical model is fast , simple to implement and allows to treat up to @xmath0 atoms and is thus directly applicable to many experimental setups .",
    "it has proven to perform well by comparison to experimental data @xcite and predicts many remarkable properties such as the universal relation between the nonlinear optical susceptibility and the rydberg excited fraction in three - level media .",
    "one question that immediately arises is , whether these properties are only valid if the system behaves classically due to strong decoherence or if they also hold in largely coherent systems . in other words : in which parameter regimes is the re model valid ?    in this paper we investigate the application of the re model to an ensemble of resonantly driven three - level atoms . through extensive monte - carlo simulations , ates _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found that the nonlinear optical susceptibility and the rydberg density obey a universal relation .",
    "we show that this universal relation can be understood as an intrinsic property of the re model .",
    "then we show that the global observables , predicted by the re model can be reproduced using a simple semi - analytical model by treating the atomic medium as a collection of super - atoms  @xcite .",
    "starting from the analytic solution of the re for a single super - atom , we illustrate how the re model is capable of reproducing the scaling laws predicted in  @xcite . combining the universal relation  @xcite with our result for the rydberg excited fraction",
    ", we can describe the nonlinear optical response of a resonantly driven rydberg gas in terms of single atom properties alone . to check the validity of the semi - analytical model we benchmark it by comparing to full me simulations with few atoms .",
    "we find that it performs well whenever interatomic coherences are suppressed .",
    "the re model provides a way to calculate the steady state of a strongly interacting many - body system subject to laser driving , with a computational complexity that scales almost linear with the atom number as long as the rydberg excited fraction is small . for details of the algorithm ,",
    "see refs .",
    "the setup we have in mind is the three - level system , for example in @xmath1rb , with atomic states @xmath2 as used in ref .",
    "the ground state @xmath3 is resonantly coupled to an intermediate state @xmath4 by a ( weak ) probe laser with rabi frequency @xmath5 .",
    "the intermediate state @xmath6 is resonantly coupled to the rydberg state @xmath7 by a ( strong ) coupling laser with rabi frequency @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath6 state spontaneously decays to the ground state with rate @xmath9 , while the rydberg state is long lived ( decay rate much smaller than @xmath9 ) .",
    "the additional dephasings caused by the finite laser bandwidths lead to the total linewidths @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the probe transition and the two photon transition , respectively  @xcite .",
    "two atoms that are in the rydberg state experience repulsive van der waals type interactions with strength @xmath12ghz  @xmath13m@xmath14 .",
    "the hamiltonian of an ensemble of @xmath15 atoms , in the rotating wave approximation , reads ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 describes the coupling of the atoms to the laser fields . in this work",
    "we restrict our analysis to the case of resonant laser excitation , however , the re approach is also straightforwardly applied to the case of off - resonant driving @xcite .",
    "incoherent processes can be included as lindblad terms @xcite leading to the master equation for the density matrix @xmath19+\\mathcal{l}[\\rho].\\ ] ] for a single atom ( @xmath20 ) one can transform this into a re for the populations of the atomic levels by adiabatically eliminating the coherences ( @xmath21 for @xmath22 ) @xcite . in the many - body case one can generalize this to a re for the populations of the many - body configurations @xmath23 , where @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "we employ a monte carlo technique to solve the many - body re .",
    "that is , starting from the global ground state @xmath25 we perform a random walk through the space of configurations @xmath26 and average over many such trajectories , ensuring the convergence to a global steady state .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath27 and the lindblad term @xmath28 $ ] couple two configurations @xmath26 only if they differ solely in the state of one atom .",
    "therefore , in order to calculate the transition rates between two states , one only has to take into account the jump probability of the atom whose state is changing .",
    "the interaction between atoms in the rydberg state is incorporated as a shift of the rydberg level of the considered atom , @xmath29 , where the primed sum only runs over atoms that are in the rydberg state in the current step .",
    "@xmath30 enters into the single atom master equation as a detuning of the rydberg level of atom @xmath31 , ( i.e. , via an additional term @xmath32 ) , thereby excluding true many - body quantum correlations .",
    "technically , in a single step of the monte carlo procedure , an atom is picked randomly , its transition rates to other states are calculated by solving the single atom master equation including the local interaction shift , and in a further random process the decision is made on whether the atom changes its state and , if it does , which state it jumps to .",
    "we use the steady - state values of the populations of the considered atom as jump probabilities as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , but different from refs .",

    "@xcite arises as an intrinsic feature of the re model .",

    "@xmath40 is the value of @xmath41 in the absence of the coupling laser ( @xmath42 ) , which corresponds to the case of a two - level atom with states @xmath43 and @xmath6 only . in the non - interacting limit ( reached for low atomic densities and/or probe intensities ) , the rydberg density is equal to the non - interacting rydberg density ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "hence @xmath45 , corresponding to perfect eit . in the strongly - interacting limit ,",
    "when the rydberg population is strongly suppressed due to the rydberg blockade ( @xmath46 ) , the absorption approaches its two - level value @xmath47 .",
    "the re model always fulfils the universal relation   due to the following reasoning : in steady state the susceptibility @xmath41 is proportional to the population of the intermediate level @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "substituting @xmath49 into eq .  , the relation is simply @xmath50 if this linear relation between the steady - state population of the intermediate level and the rydberg level holds for the single - atom steady states for any ( interaction induced ) detuning @xmath51 , then it also holds for the ensemble average obtained from the re model due to the fact that in the re model interactions are only taken into account as level shifts of the rydberg level .",
    "indeed for the case of perfect eit ( @xmath52 ) we find that both sides of eq .",
    "are equal to @xmath53 in the single atom case .",

    "<S> we identify the previously reported universal dependence of the susceptibility on the rydberg excited fraction as an intrinsic property of the rate equation model that is rooted in one - body properties . </S>",
    "<S> benchmarking against exact master equation calculations , we identify regimes in which the semi - analytic model is particularly reliable . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of the model improves in the presence of dephasing which destroys higher order atomic coherences . </S>"
