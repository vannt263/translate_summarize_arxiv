    "ten years ago , two different teams using sne type ia as standard candles announced that the expansion of the universe is speeding up and not slowing as believed by the cosmology community@xcite .",
    "the authors interpreted their results as implying that the cosmological constant @xmath1 is greater than zero , an assumption that is not only surviving but has been strengthened in the last decade by many independent astronomical observations@xcite ( see also peebles and ratra@xcite , and padmanabhan@xcite for reviews ) .    on the other hand , until now there is no consensus about the present value of the hubble parameter even when the estimates of @xmath0 are limited to the cepheid period - luminosity relation and the correlation of the luminosity at maximum light for sne type ia .",
    "for instance , riess _",
    "et al._@xcite using a hybrid sample composed by cepheids in galaxies and recent type ia sne concluded that @xmath6 @xmath7 while sandage@xcite and coworkers based on data from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project are claiming that @xmath8 @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , is still worthwhile to improve the direct local estimates of @xmath0 , and , probably , more important , to investigate their concordance with independent methods .",
    "an interesting one is provided by the combination of sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) and measurements of x - ray surface brightness from galaxy clusters .",
    "the so - called sze is a small distortion on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum provoked by the inverse compton scattering of the cmb photons passing through a population of hot electrons@xcite .",
    "observing the temperature decrement of the cmb in the direction of galaxy clusters and the x - ray spectrum emitted by the hot electron gas pervading the cluster , it is possible to break the degeneracy between concentration and temperature@xcite , and , therefore , to calculate the angular diameter distance ( add)@xcite . this technique for measuring distances is completely independent of other methods ( as the one provided by the luminosity distance ) , and it can be used to measure distances at high redshifts directly .",
    "review papers on this subject have been published by birkinshaw@xcite and carlstrom , holder and reese@xcite .",
    "more recently , such a technique has been applied for a fairly large number of clusters@xcite .    in 2006 ,",
    "bonamente and collaborators@xcite determined the add distance to 38 clusters of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath9 using x - ray data from chandra and sunyaev - zeldovich effect data data from the owens valley radio observatory and the berkeley - illinois - maryland association interferometric arrays . assuming spherical symmetry , the cluster plasma and dark matter distributions were analyzed by using a hydrostatic equilibrium model accounting for radial variations in density , temperature and abundances .",
    "in addition , by fixing the earlier cosmic concordance @xmath1cdm model ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , they obtained for the hubble constant @xmath12 ( statistical followed by systematic uncertainty at 1@xmath13 c. l. ) .",
    "the main advantage of this method for estimating @xmath0 is that it does not rely on the extragalactic distance ladder being fully independent of any local calibrator . in a point of fact , once the angular diameter distance has been measured a large amount of astrophysical and cosmological tests can be performed in order to constrain the relevant free parameters@xcite .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that in the above quoted determination of the hubble constant , a specific cosmology was fixed from the very beginning .",
    "this is needed because the determination of the hubble parameter from sze / x - ray technique is endowed with a strong degeneracy with respect to the matter density parameter which can only be broken by considering additional cosmological tests .",
    "an interesting possibility is given by the signature of the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) from the last scattering surface ( lss ) .    in 2005 , eisenstein _",
    "et al._@xcite presented the large scale correlation function from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) showing clear evidence for the baryon acoustic peak at @xmath14 mpc scale , a result in good agreement with the analyses from cmb data@xcite .",
    "the breaking on the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath15 by applying this bao signature is possible because it does not depend on @xmath0 and is highly sensitive to the matter density parameter .",
    "the combination sze / x - ray with bao has been recently discussed in the literature by cunha , marassi and lima@xcite .    in this article , we discuss the determinations of @xmath0 and @xmath15 by considering the same 38 clusters from bonamente _ et al . _",
    "sample where spherical symmetry was assumed .",
    "our basic findings follow from a joint analysis involving the data from sze and x - ray surface brightness with the recent sdss measurements of the baryon acoustic peak .",
    "the influence of the intrinsic cluster geometry on @xmath16 it will be quantified by comparing the results derived here with a recent determination of both parameters@xcite based on de filippis _ et al . _ sample formed by 25 triaxial clusters@xcite .",
    "let us now consider that the universe is described by a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) geometry    @xmath17,\\ ] ]    driven by cold dark matter plus a cosmological constant ( @xmath1cdm ) .    in this background , the angular diameter distance , @xmath18 , can be written as@xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and the dimensionless function @xmath21 is given by @xmath22^{1/2}.$ ] as it appears , the above expression has only two free parameters ( @xmath23 ) . in this way",
    ", we perform a statistical fit over the @xmath24 plane in light of bonamente _ et al .",
    "_ data sample@xcite . in our analysis",
    "we use a maximum likelihood that can be determined by a @xmath25 statistics , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the observational add , @xmath28 is the uncertainty in the individual distance , @xmath29 is the contribution of the statistical errors ( see table 3 in bonamente et al.@xcite ( 2006 ) ) added in quadrature ( @xmath30% ) and the complete set of parameters is given by @xmath31 .    in",
    "what follows , we first consider the sze / x - ray distances separately , and , further , we present a joint analysis including the bao signature from the sdss catalog . note that a specific flat @xmath1cdm cosmology has not been fixed a priori in the analysis below .    ,",

    "note that a large range for the @xmath32 parameter is allowed , ( @xmath41 ) , at @xmath42 of confidence level .",
    "in particular , we found @xmath43 with @xmath44 at @xmath33% confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "naturally , such bounds on @xmath32 are reasonably dependent on the cosmological model adopted .",
    "for example , if we fix @xmath45 we have @xmath46 , for @xmath47 we have @xmath48 , and both cases are permitted with high degree of confidence .",
    "this means that using only the bonamente _",
    "_ sample ( spherical cluster hypothesis ) we can not constrain severely the energetic components of the @xmath1cdm model with basis on the sze / x - ray data alone . as one may conclude , one additional cosmological test ( fixing @xmath15 ) is necessary in order to break the degeneracy on the @xmath36 plane .      as remarked in the introduction , more stringent constraints on the space parameter ( @xmath49 ) can be obtained by combining the sze / x - ray with the bao signature@xcite .",
    "the peak detected ( from a sample of 46748 luminous red galaxies selected from the sdss main sample ) is predicted to arise precisely at the measured scale of 100 @xmath50 mpc .",

    "on the other hand , the importance of the intrinsic geometry of the cluster has been emphasized by many authors@xcite . as a consequence ,",

    "actually , the assumed cluster shape seems to affect considerably the sze / x - ray distances , and , therefore , the @xmath16 estimates .",
