    "we would like to emphasize that the situation differs from the case of straight filaments for which the twist density @xmath450  depends only on the fluctuations of the euler angle @xmath451  for such filaments , vanishing twist rigidity ( @xmath142 ) implies that there is no energy penalty for twisting the cross section about the centerline , but the presence of bending rigidity ( @xmath171 ) suffices to suppress spatial fluctuations of the centerline about its straight stress free configuration .",

    "@xmath452  there is no elastic energy penalty for out  of  plane fluctuations of the ring and the amplitude of such fluctuations diverges even if the bending rigidity remains finite .",
    "therefore , wormlike chain theories in which only bending rigidity is taken into account , can not model the spatial conformation of fluctuating rings .",
    "we found that a crossover length scale @xmath453 exists , below which straight rod behavior dominates and writhe of the centerline and twist of the cross section about it are decoupled , and above which spontaneous curvature becomes important and twist affects the three dimensional configurations of the centerline of the ring . in this context",
    "we would like to propose the as yet unproven but plausible conjecture , that the existence of this crossover does not depend on the topology of the ring and is characteristic of filaments with spontaneous curvature in their stress free state .",

    ", one can move from an inertial regime where relaxation is accompanied by temporal oscillations , to a non  oscillatory , purely dissipative regime . in the dissipation",
    "dominated range , the relaxation at short times is determined by bending rigidity only .",
    "this agrees with the expectation that short time relaxation is dominated by small scale , straight rod behavior . at longer times , the decay of writhe correlations depends on both bending and twist rigidities . while inertial effects are not expected to be important for microscopic objects such as small plasmids , our dynamic response functions can describe the relaxation of rings of arbitrary mass and size , following the cessation of externally applied forces and torques .",
    "we would like to comment on the limitations of the approach presented in this paper .",
    "the domain of applicability of our theory is limited to the weak fluctuation regime , in the sense that the deviations of the euler angles from their values in the undeformed ring , must be sufficiently small .",
    "although , in principle , our general formalism is applicable to rings with arbitrary spontaneous twist in their stress free reference state , the analysis of this problem meets with considerable mathematical difficulties and is the subject of ongoing work .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that since our theory is based on the linear theory of elasticity of thin rods , all persistence lengths and radii of curvature are assumed to be much larger than the diameter of the filament that serves as a small scale cutoff .",
    "consideration of microscopic physics on length scales smaller than this diameter requires the introduction of additional model assumptions ( see references @xcite ) and is beyond the scope of this paper .    after this work was submitted for publication we learned about a related study of thermal fluctuations in dna plasmids in which the writhe distribution function was also calculated@xcite .",
    "this work is complementary to ours : while we assume that the equilibrium stress free state of our filament is that of a planar untwisted circular ring , reference @xcite deals with filaments with straight untwisted stress free state .",
