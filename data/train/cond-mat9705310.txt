    "oscillatory interlayer exchange coupling in metallic magnetic multilayers causes the magnetizations of neighbouring magnetic layers separated by non - magnetic spacers to be spontaneously aligned ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically depending on the thickness of the spacer material .",
    "this phenomenon has been intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically over the last few years @xcite .",
    "the relation between the periods , by far the most investigated feature of the oscillations , and the electronic structure of multilayered systems is a fundamental aspect of the mechanism responsible for the origin of this phenomenon .",
    "in fact , the periods were originally shown to be dependent on the shape of the spacer fermi surface , where two distinct criteria were proposed for determining the periods with which the interlayer coupling oscillates @xcite . within the quantum well",
    "theory the wave vectors yielding the effective oscillation periods correspond to extremal radii of the fermi surface in the direction perpendicular to the layers , or in other words to half the caliper measurements @xcite . on the other hand , in the rkky theory adapted to the layered geometry ,",
    "the periods are associated with wave vectors perpendicular to the layers linking two points of the fermi surface with antiparallel velocities @xcite . despite the distinction between those geometrical criteria , the periods predicted by both theories , at least in their original formulations , agree in most cases .",
    "when they do not coincide , such as , for example , when the lattice lacks reflection symmetry about the layer planes , suitable transformations of the fermi surface can be performed , which reestablish the correspondence between the quantum well and the rkky periods @xcite . recently however , fundamental oscillation periods not directly associated with the shape of the spacer fermi surface were obtained @xcite .",
    "those periods , which correspond to higher order contributions to the exchange coupling , are no longer determined by the above geometrical criteria but by a set of more general conditions on the electronic structure of the system , although they are still indirectly dependent on the shape of the fermi surface .",
    "these conditions provide a systematic way of determining the oscillation periods involved in the interlayer coupling .    in order to test the applicability of those general conditions",
    ", it is worth investigating them in situations where the spacer fermi surface , clearly a relevant factor in this matter , is variable .",
    "one approach is to use an alloy spacer of variable composition although the fermi surface is no longer sharply defined .",
    "also , it is well know that the scattering of electrons by random impurities strongly damps the oscillations .",
    "in fact , the amplitude of the coupling is found to decay exponentially with the concentration of impurities @xcite .",
    "an alternative to an alloy is a metallic superlattice whose fermi surface depends on the proportions and layer thicknesses of the constituent materials but where the oscillations are not damped by incoherent electronic scattering .",
    "moreover , nature provides us with only a limited number of non - magnetic metals .",
    "however , by combining distinct materials in superlattices the number of possible non - magnetic superlattices is infinite .",
    "the purpose of this communication is to investigate the oscillation periods of the interlayer exchange coupling when the spacer is a non - magnetic superlattice .",
    "it is shown that the alteration of the oscillation periods reflects the deformation of the corresponding fermi surface only when the coupling is investigated as a function of the number of superlattice cells separating the magnetic layers . in the simple model treated here ,",
    "the oscillation periods of the coupling are written in terms of controllable parameters which are related to the composition of the superlattices , and which , accordingly , allow the periods to be tuned .",
    "it is hoped that such a simple model reflects what occurs in realistic systems , and this may be confirmed by future experiments .",
    "the sequence adopted in this work is described as follows . in order to make the work",
    "self - contained , a brief summary of the general method for determining the oscillation periods in a multi - orbital tight - binding model @xcite is presented in section [ periods ] .",
    "secondly , the method is shown to be applicable when the spacer is a superlattice , using the clear correspondence between orbital and intracell indices .",
    "subsequently , the oscillation periods are obtained following the analysis of the electronic structure of the system and are explicitly written in terms of parameters associated with the superlattice composition .",
    "a brief summary of the general method for determining the oscillation periods of the interlayer coupling is presented here . see reference @xcite for a comprehensive discussion of the method .    for the sake of simplicity , we consider two parallel magnetic planes , labelled @xmath0 and @xmath1 , embedded in an infinite non - magnetic metal .",
    "as far as the coupling as a function of the spacer thickness is concerned , the number of magnetic planes influences only the phase and amplitude of the oscillations and does not affect the periods @xcite .",
    "since the periods are the main concern here , the restriction to two single magnetic planes does not pose any limitations on the results obtained .",
    "the interlayer coupling @xmath2 is given by the difference in total energy between the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic configurations or , in other words , by the energy necessary to flip the magnetization in one of the planes .",
    "based on the formalism introduced by dalbuquerque e castro _ et al _ , the coupling @xmath2 is written in terms of the one - electron green functions of the multilayered system by the following expression @xmath3 where @xmath4 . in the equations above @xmath5",
    "is the propagator between planes @xmath0 and @xmath1 for electrons with spin @xmath6 in the ferromagnetic configuration of the system , @xmath7 is the fermi function , @xmath8 is a diagonal matrix in orbital indices representing the strength of the local exchange potential in the ferromagnetic layers , and the sum over @xmath9 is restricted to the two - dimensional brillouin zone . bearing in mind that the exchange splitting of the magnetic material is localized on the two planes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the propagators @xmath10 can be rewritten as a function of the bulk spacer propagators @xmath11 and @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 moreover , it can be shown that within the single - band model the dependence of @xmath14 upon those propagators is such that @xmath15 .",
    "it is clear that the spacer thickness dependence of the interlayer coupling is entirely determined by the off - diagonal propagators @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the investigation of the oscillation periods thus requires an analysis of @xmath11 as a function of the interplane distance .    in the layered geometry ,",
    "where @xmath9 represents the in - plane wave - vector , the expression for a general matrix element @xmath16 representing the propagation from an orbital @xmath17 at plane @xmath18 into an orbital @xmath19 at plane @xmath20 of an electron at the fermi level @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 where the integration variable @xmath23 is the wave vector perpendicular to the layers , @xmath24 is the interplane distance , @xmath25 describes the bulk spacer band structure , @xmath26 is the band index , and @xmath27 is the projection of the eigenstate @xmath26 into the orbital @xmath17 for a given @xmath28 . by changing the integration contour from the real axis to the boundaries of a semi - infinite rectangle in the complex plane whose",
    "base lies on the real axis between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the evaluation of the integral above is simplified to the determination of the poles of the integrand inside the appropriate contour and their respective residues .",
    "the rectangle is in the upper - half plane for @xmath31 and in the lower - half plane otherwise .",
    "clearly , the poles are given by the values of @xmath28 satisfying the condition @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .    by adding the residues associated with the contributory poles , labelled @xmath34 , an analytical expression for @xmath35",
    "is obtained , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath36 where the matrix elements of the matrix @xmath37 are @xmath38 _ { q_\\perp = q_j^s}\\right\\}^{-1}\\,\\ , .",
    "\\label{aa}\\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath39 depend neither on @xmath18 nor on @xmath20 and the only dependence on the distance between the planes is inside the argument of the exponentials . it should be stressed that this simple method for obtaining the one - electron propagators is exclusive to the one - dimensional case , and therefore for fixed values of @xmath40 . the exponentials in eq.([glm ] ) are independent of the orbital indices , which means that all matrix elements oscillate with the same periods .",
    "note that in calculating eq.([aa ] ) it was assumed that the coefficients @xmath41 have neither singularities nor branch points inside the integration contour .",
    "in this way , the coefficients are evaluated just at the poles @xmath34 . in general , branch cuts associated with the coefficients",
    "@xmath41 may exist , but because they may be chosen not to intersect the real axis , the factor @xmath42 in the integrand of eq.([integral ] ) ensures that the corresponding contribution is negligible for large @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the expression above is correct in the asymptotic limit of large interplane distance @xcite .",
    "it is clear from eq.([glm ] ) that @xmath35 is an oscillatory function of the distance between the planes and it oscillates with different periods , each one associated with its respective wave vector @xmath34 .",
    "for this reason it is interesting to look at the physical significance of the poles . the poles may be real or complex , but we note that only the real poles contribute significantly to the coupling .",
    "this is because complex poles , when inserted in eq.([glm ] ) , damp the oscillations and are important only in cases of very thin spacers .",
    "real poles , which are obtained from the electronic structure of the bulk spacer , are just the perpendicular coordinates of the fermi surface for a fixed value of @xmath9 . in other words , they are the perpendicular components of the wave vectors with which electrons of energy @xmath21 propagate across the spacer .    having investigated @xmath35 as a function of the interplane distance , it is worth stressing that the functions @xmath44 must oscillate with the same periods . when expanded in a fourier series , taking into account the possibility of quasi - periodicity of @xmath11 @xcite , the function @xmath44 is written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the fourier coefficients determining the amplitude of the oscillations and depend on the exact form of the function @xmath44 .",
    "the indices @xmath47 are integers and there are as many as the number of poles @xmath34 . note that the periods are given by @xmath48 and do not depend on the exact form of @xmath49 , since they are obtained from the bulk spacer band structure . because the indices @xmath50 run over the set of integers , there is always an infinite number of periods defined by eq.([f ] ) , even for a small number of poles @xmath34 . in spite of the somewhat congested notation of the general expression above , in practice",
    "there are only a few indices involved due to the restricted number of real solutions crossing the fermi level .",
    "in fact , the number of solutions is related to the number of sheets of the fermi surface .    when eq.([f ] ) is inserted into eq.([j ] ) , the two - dimensional integral can be evaluated through the stationary phase approximation , valid in the asymptotic limit of large spacer thickness @xcite . in doing so",
    ", the periods of the coupling are identified by selecting the periods of @xmath44 associated with wave vectors satisfying the following condition , @xmath51 \\ , = 0 \\,\\ , , \\label{grad}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the two - dimensional gradient in @xmath40-space .",
    "the equation above gives the necessary conditions for constructive interference between electrons across the spacer .",
    "the otherwise destructive interference does not contribute to the coupling .",
    "eq.([grad ] ) simply selects the points across the two - dimensional brillouin zone which yield the effective periods with which the coupling oscillates .",
    "as pointed out in reference @xcite , although the wave vectors @xmath34 are directly related to the fermi surface , the general wave vectors @xmath53 are not .",
    "this is a result of the interference between incommensurate wave vectors @xmath34 giving rise to a new set of periods not directly obtained from the structure of the fermi surface .",
    "consequently , geometrical criteria can not be used in general to select the oscillation periods . however , for fermi surfaces with a single sheet , where the off - diagonal propagators oscillate as a function of the interplane distance with only one period , the selection rules given by eq.([grad ] ) coincide with the geometrical criteria of the rkky theory @xcite .",
    "the only difference in this case is that eq.([grad ] ) determines the respective harmonics , in addition to the fundamental rkky periods .    in summary ,",
    "the determination of the oscillation periods results from the analysis of the bulk spacer off - diagonal propagators where the relevant real wave vectors , under the stationary phase condition , are obtained from the band structure .",
    "when dealing with multi - sheet fermi surfaces , the possibility of interferences between incommensurate wave vectors may introduce new features in the oscillations , which are not present in the case of single - period oscillations of the propagators .",
    "having summarized the method for determining the oscillation periods of the coupling , it is worth stressing that no particular form for the spacer material was assumed .",
    "the only information required is the bulk band structure which makes possible the investigation of the coupling across arbitrary spacers .",
    "spacers consisting of superlattices of distinct non - magnetic materials will be investigated here .",
    "more specifically , the material into which the magnetic planes are embedded is composed of two non - magnetic metals @xmath54 and @xmath55 with respective thicknesses @xmath56 and @xmath57 periodically alternated , as schematically displayed in figure [ superlattice ] . in order to make a distinction , these structures will be hereafter named superlatticed spacers , in contrast to the conventional single - layered spacers .",
    "the interlayer coupling across superlatticed spacers can be looked upon as a function of different thicknesses , namely @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath59 represents the number of cells separating the magnetic planes .",
    "each cell is formed by a set of @xmath56 planes of metal @xmath54 and @xmath57 planes of metal @xmath55 .",
    "as far as the oscillation periods are concerned , the coupling across superlatticed spacers as a function of @xmath56 or @xmath57 does not present new features when compared to the coupling across conventional single - layered spacers as a function of @xmath56 or @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "in other words , if a single - layered spacer of material @xmath54 yields an interlayer coupling with period @xmath60 and likewise @xmath61 is the period for the coupling across a single - layered spacer of material @xmath55 , the coupling across a superlatticed spacer of materials @xmath54 and @xmath55 will oscillate with period @xmath60 when seen as a function of @xmath56 and with period @xmath61 when seen as a function of @xmath57 .",
    "however , when looked upon as a function of @xmath59 , for fixed values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the coupling oscillates with periods different from @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "although the superlattice fermi surface is different from the individual fermi surfaces of materials a and b separately , it is only when investigated as a function of @xmath59 that the deformation of the fermi surface is translated into a change in the periods .    following the steps of the previous section",
    ", the bulk spacer band structure must be calculated . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the single - band tight - binding model is considered assuming a simple cubic lattice structure for the superlattice grown along the ( 100 ) direction . for the two given materials @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the in - plane energies are labelled @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and the interplane hoppings are @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the hopping between planes @xmath54 and @xmath55 is represented by @xmath66 .",
    "we recall that the tight - binding parameters above depend on the in - plane wave vector @xmath9 through @xmath67 $ ] and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is either @xmath54 or @xmath55 , @xmath70 is the on - site energy and @xmath71 is the hopping between nearest - neighbour sites in material @xmath69 .",
    "note that @xmath72 is perpendicular to the layers whereas @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the coordinates of @xmath9 .",
    "because each set of @xmath58 planes is periodically repeated , where @xmath75 , the system can be represented by cells of @xmath58 planes equally spaced . consequently , the tight - binding hamiltonian of the infinite multilayered system , when written in the appropriate basis , becomes a @xmath76 matrix given by @xmath77 & \\left[{\\cal h}_{ab}\\right ] \\\\",

    "the tight - binding hamiltonian above is equivalent to the @xmath58-band hamiltonian of a one - dimensional system . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath58 intracell planes may be considered as orbitals of a linear chain whose nearest neighbour elements are @xmath89 apart .",
    "having established this correspondence , hereafter intracell and orbital indices will be mentioned with no distinction between them .",
    "following section [ periods ] , the oscillation periods result from the analysis of the bulk spacer off - diagonal propagators as a function of the distance between the planes .",
    "note however that in the case treated here the effective interplane distance must be the distance between the cells , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath90 .",
    "hence , the off - diagonal propagators as a function of the number of cells @xmath59 are the ones to be investigated .",
    "these propagators depend on the band structure of the system , as clearly shown in eq.([integral ] ) . the original tight - binding hamiltonian is partially diagonalized by both in - plane and perpendicular fourier transforms , the remaining problem being the determination of the eigenvalues of the @xmath76 matrix in eq.([h(nxn ) ] ) .",
    "therefore , the information on the oscillation periods of the coupling in a superlatticed system depends on the diagonalization of this matrix , which will be presented in the next section .    to maintain the correspondence between the intracell planes of the superlattice and orbital indices of the linear chain",
    ", one has to assume that in the case of superlatticed spacers the magnetic planes embedded in the non - magnetic system must be formed by two separate magnetic cells .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity and with no loss of generality , we consider only two magnetic planes . if we label the magnetic planes with the intracell indices @xmath91 in the cell @xmath0 and @xmath92 in the cell @xmath59 , the relevant green functions to be calculated are the off - diagonal propagators @xmath93 , i.e. , @xmath94 in addition to the fact that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are intracell indices , the only difference between the equation above and eq.([integral ] ) is the interplane distance @xmath95 which modifies the integral limits .",
    "similarly to section [ periods ] , the integral above is evaluated through the residues method , where the determination of the poles follow the diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "making use of the particular symmetry of the matrices displayed above , the determinant of @xmath96 in eq.([h(nxn ) ] ) can be written in terms of the sizes of its sub - matrices @xmath56 and @xmath57 yielding a simple analytical expression for the oscillation periods of the one - electron propagators .",
    "the energy eigenvalues @xmath97 are solutions of the equation @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the identity matrix . in this case",

    "the determinant of a @xmath76 square matrix is a sum of @xmath102 terms .",
    "those terms are made of products of @xmath58 matrix elements , following all their possible permutations . because the sub - matrices on the diagonal have only two distinct non - zero elements , the evaluation of their determinants by counting the number of combinations allowed by the possible permutations is not particularly difficult and can be expressed in term of the sizes @xmath82 .",
    "the solution of this combinatorial problem is given by @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 is an integer , the upper limit of the sum is the integer part of @xmath105 and @xmath106 is the binomial coefficient .",
    "note that the expression above is valid for symmetric tri - diagonal matrices with similar elements along each of the diagonals .",
    "bearing in mind that @xmath107 is equivalent to the slab hamiltonian , the values of @xmath97 satisfying @xmath108 through eq.([det - tri ] ) are just the associated eigenvalues .    the hamiltonian @xmath96 in eq.([h(nxn ) ] ) is almost tri - diagonal .",
    "the matrix @xmath96 is not tri - diagonal due to two of its elements , namely @xmath109 and @xmath110 , which are non - zero .",
    "therefore , an expression for the determinant of @xmath96 is not expected to be very different from the one in eq.([det - tri ] ) .",
    "in fact , by considering the only two non - zero elements of the submatrices in eq.([hab ] ) and recounting the number of possible permutations , the determinant of the matrix @xmath96 can be expressed in terms of the determinants of the matrices @xmath111 and @xmath112 . in the similar case of @xmath113 , the determinant is given by @xmath114 note that the equation above is written in terms of lower - order determinants of eq.([det - tri ] ) and is an analytical expression for @xmath115 in terms of its sizes @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "it is instructive to point out that when @xmath116 , that is , when a single - layered spacer is considered , the usual eigenvalues @xmath117 of an infinite linear chain are obtained from eq.([deth ] ) through the condition @xmath118 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath97 of the hamiltonian @xmath96 are solutions of the polynomial equation defined by eqs.([deth ] ) and ( [ det - tri ] ) through the condition @xmath98 .",
    "to illustrate this point , figure [ bandn3n6 ] displays the band structure of a superlatticed system consisting of two materials @xmath54 and @xmath55 whose tight - binding parameters are arbitrarily chosen as @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",

    "all bands are separated by energy gaps except for the ones in figure [ bandn3n6]a corresponding to @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",

    "the advantage of writing the expression of the determinant in terms of the number of planes @xmath56 and @xmath57 becomes clear , for the oscillation periods can be written in terms of those parameters .",

    "this indicates that the off - diagonal propagators oscillate as a function of the number of cells @xmath59 with a single period . in this case",
    "the fermi surface is deformed as a function of @xmath56 and @xmath57 but the number of periods is left unchanged .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath137 .",

    "the periods depend on the intra - cell composition determined by @xmath56 and @xmath57 as can be seen by the change in caliper of the extremal wave vectors spanning the fermi surface in the centre of the brillouin zones . following eq.([cosq ] ) , the periods are displayed in table [ tabelperiods ] and the product @xmath145 as a function of @xmath59 for different intracell parameters and for @xmath146 is shown in figure [ oscillations ] .",
    "note the agreement between the periods in figure [ oscillations ] and the ones in table [ tabelperiods ] .",
    "the results presented above indicate that the oscillation periods of the interlayer coupling across superlatticed spacers are related to the shape of the fermi surface when the coupling is investigated as a function of the number of cells of the superlattice .",
    "therefore , a change in the composition of the superlattice enables one to deform the corresponding fermi surface and consequently tune the oscillation periods of the coupling .",
    "moreover , although the present analysis is not concerned with the strength of the oscillation periods , it should be mentioned that the change in intra - cell parameters not only alters the relevant wave vectors but also the respective curvatures of the fermi surface .",
    "bearing in mind the dependence of the oscillation amplitude on such curvatures , the contribution of periods may be enhanced by the variation of the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "non - rkky periods , for instance , which in some cases contribute weakly to the oscillations @xcite , could become more relevant through the variation of those parameters .",
    "it is hoped that the simple case treated here reflects what occurs in real systems , which may be confirmed by future experiments .",
    "alloys that , under certain critical temperatures , present ordered phases may be used to test the veracity of the present claims . in the ordered phase , cu - zn alloys , for instance ,",
    "have a bcc structure consisting of interpenetrating simple cubic sublattices @xcite . in this case , cells formed by one plane of cu and one plane of zn are periodically repeated , corresponding to a possible realization of the system proposed in this communication .",
    "the lattice parameters of the ordered cu - zn alloy and that of fe are similar , which may allow them to be grown in layered structures .",
    "although the oscillation periods of the coupling can not be tuned in this system , it is suggested that the periodicities associated with the corresponding fermi surface will become evident only when plotted as a function of even ( or odd ) number of spacer layers .",
    "alternatively , by growing superlattices of non - magnetic metals , _",
    "e.g. _ noble metals , in wedge - shaped systems @xcite one can change the intracell composition of the system to test whether the periods of the coupling can be tuned , as the present calculations indicate .",
