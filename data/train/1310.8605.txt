    "a group @xmath1 is said to be _ residually finite _ if for any distinct @xmath7 there is a finite group @xmath8 and a homomorphism @xmath9 such that @xmath10 in @xmath8 . informally speaking this means that @xmath1 can be approximated by its finite quotients , in which case these quotients can be used to study the group @xmath1 .",
    "for example , two classical theorems of malcev state that finitely presented residually finite groups have solvable word problem @xcite , and finitely generated residually finite groups are hopfian @xcite .",
    "thus residual finiteness is a very basic property , so given any infinite group @xmath1 , one of the first questions we could ask about @xmath1 is whether it is residually finite .",
    "the goal of this work is to prove residual finiteness of the outer automorphism group @xmath11 , where @xmath1 belongs to one of the following large classes of groups :    * the class of virtually compact special groups ( in the sense of f. haglund and d. wise @xcite ) , * the class of fundamental groups of compact @xmath2-manifolds .    before formulating the main results ,",
    "let us recall some background of the problem .",
    "a well - known theorem of g. baumslag @xcite asserts that for a finitely generated residually finite group @xmath1 its group of automorphisms , @xmath12 , is also residually finite . in @xcite",
    "the second author and osin showed that in the case when @xmath1 has infinitely many ends , the same assumptions on @xmath1 ( finite generation and residual finiteness ) also imply that the group of outer automorphisms @xmath0 is residually finite .",
    "however , this ` outer ' version of baumslag s result may not hold if @xmath1 is @xmath13-ended .",
    "indeed , bumagin and wise @xcite proved that for any finitely presented group @xmath14 there is a finitely generated residually finite ( @xmath13-ended ) group @xmath1 such that @xmath15 .",
    "a classical criterion for establishing residual finiteness of outer automorphism groups was discovered by grossman @xcite .",
    "this criterion imposes stronger assumptions on the group : @xmath1 must be conjugacy separable and any pointwise inner automorphism of @xmath1 must be inner . recall that a group is _ conjugacy separable _",
    "if for any pair of non - conjugate elements @xmath7 there exists a finite quotient @xmath8 , of @xmath1 , in which the images of @xmath16 are non - conjugate .",
    "an automorphism @xmath17 is said to be _ pointwise inner _ if @xmath18 is conjugate to @xmath6 for each @xmath4 .",
    "the set of all pointwise inner automorphism , @xmath19 , forms a normal subgroup of @xmath12",
    ".    in @xcite grossman proved the following theorem : if @xmath1 is a finitely generated conjugacy separable group such that @xmath20 then @xmath0 is residually finite . unfortunately , it is usually hard to show that a given group is conjugacy separable , as it is a much more delicate condition than residual finiteness ( for example conjugacy separability may not pass to subgroups or overgroups of finite index  see @xcite ) .",
    "one class of groups for which conjugacy separability is known is the class @xmath21 , virtual retracts of finitely generated right angled artin groups ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the class of groups which contain a finite index subgroup from the class @xmath21 .",
    "the significance of the class @xmath22 can be seen from the work of haglund and wise @xcite , who proved that every virtually compact special group belongs to this class ( recall that a group @xmath1 is said to be _ virtually compact special _ if @xmath1 contains a finite index subgroup which is the fundamental group of a compact special cube complex in the sense of @xcite ) .",
    "the list of virtually compact special groups is quite large and includes most coxeter groups , @xmath13-relator groups with torsion and finitely generated fully residually free ( limit ) groups ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "therefore the following theorem covers a wide range of groups :    [ thm : avr ] for any group @xmath23 the group @xmath0 is residually finite .",
    "as discussed above , theorem [ thm : avr ] together with results from @xcite yields    if @xmath1 is virtually compact special then @xmath0 is residually finite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that residual finiteness of @xmath0 , when @xmath1 is itself a finitely generated right angled artin group , was proved by the second author in @xcite and , independently , by charney and vogtmann in @xcite . on the other hand , there exist finitely generated groups @xmath24 such that @xmath24 is a subgroup of some finitely generated right angled artin group and @xmath25 is not residually finite .",
    "such examples can be easily found using the modification of the rips s construction proposed by haglund and wise in @xcite .",
    "it is easy to produce examples of groups from @xmath22 which possess pointwise inner automorphisms that are not inner ( one can simply take the direct product of the free group of rank @xmath26 with a finite group @xmath27 for which @xmath28  see @xcite for a construction of such finite groups ) . also , it is unknown whether all groups from @xmath29 are conjugacy separable , thus to prove theorem [ thm : avr ] one can not simply apply grossman s criterion , and a more elaborate approach is required .",
    "the original application of grossman s criterion was the proof that @xmath30 is residually finite for any compact orientable surface @xmath31 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our second theorem extends this result to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a compact @xmath2-manifold :    [ thm:3-man ] let @xmath1 be a group containing a finite index subgroup that is isomorphic to the fundamental group of some compact @xmath2-manifold @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath0 is residually finite .    for fundamental groups of seifert",
    "fibered @xmath2-manifolds ( with two exceptions ) , the residual finiteness of outer automorphism groups was proved by allenby , kim and tang @xcite . evidently , theorem [ thm:3-man ] can not be further generalized to @xmath34-dimensional manifolds , as it is well - known that for any finitely presented group @xmath1 there is a closed @xmath34-manifold @xmath33 such that @xmath35 .",
    "it is well - known that , for a manifold @xmath33 , the group @xmath32 is closely related to the _ mapping class group _ ( i.e. , the group of isotopy classes of self - homeomorphisms ) @xmath36 of @xmath33 . for example , waldhausen @xcite proved that if @xmath33 is an irreducible orientable haken @xmath2-manifold with incompressible boundary such that @xmath33 is not a line bundle , then @xmath36 embeds into @xmath32 .",
    "a similar statement when @xmath33 is non - orientable ( but still haken and @xmath37-irreducible ) was proved in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath33 is not irreducible then the natural homomorphism @xmath38 will not , in general , be injective ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "thus theorem [ thm:3-man ] yields    suppose that @xmath33 is a compact irreducible orientable haken @xmath2-manifold with incompressible boundary that is not a line bundle .",
    "then the mapping class group @xmath36 is residually finite .",
    "thanks to a recent result of hamilton , wilton and zalesskii @xcite , stating that the fundamental group of any orientable compact @xmath2-manifold is conjugacy separable , we can prove theorem  [ thm:3-man ] using an approach which is similar to the one employed in theorem [ thm : avr ] .",
    "namely , in both theorems we use the techniques from geometric group theory , of groups acting on hyperbolic spaces , to prove a strong version of the fact that pointwise inner automorphisms are inner , which constitutes the second ingredient of grossman s criterion .",
    "let us now discuss how the two theorems above are proved in more detail .",
    "a group @xmath1 is called _ acylindrically hyperbolic _ if it admits a non - elementary acylindrical action on a hyperbolic metric space ",
    "see subsection [ subsec : acyl_hyp ] .",
    "this definition was originally proposed by d. osin in @xcite , where he proved that the class of such groups coincides with other large classes , previously studied by bestvina and fujiwara @xcite , dahmani , guirardel and osin @xcite , hamenst \" adt @xcite and the third author @xcite .",
    "the class of acylindrically hyperbolic groups is rather extensive : it includes all non - elementary relatively hyperbolic groups , non-(virtually cyclic ) groups acting properly on proper cat(@xmath39)-spaces with at least one rank @xmath13-element ( see @xcite ) , mapping class groups of compact surfaces of genus at least @xmath13 , outer automorphism groups of free groups of rank at least @xmath26 ( see @xcite ) , many groups acting on simplicial trees ( see @xcite ) , etc . in @xcite",
    "the second author and osin proved that for any compact irreducible @xmath2-manifold @xmath33 , @xmath40 is either acylindrically hyperbolic or virtually polycyclic , or @xmath33 is seifert fibered",
    ".    two elements @xmath41 of a group @xmath1 are said to be _",
    "commensurable _ if there are @xmath42 and @xmath43 such that @xmath44 in @xmath1 . in this we case",
    "we will write @xmath45 . otherwise , if @xmath6 and @xmath46 are non - commensurable , we will write @xmath47 . note that commensurability is an equivalence relation on the set of elements of @xmath1 .",
    "given a subgroup @xmath24 of a group @xmath1 and a homomorphism @xmath48 , we will say that @xmath3 is _ commensurating _ if @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",
    "commensurating homomorphisms were introduced and studied by the second author and osin in the context of relatively hyperbolic groups in @xcite . to prove theorems [ thm : avr ] and [ thm:3-man ] we study such homomorphisms for an acylindrically hyperbolic group @xmath1 .",
    "our main technical result ( theorem [ thm : comm ] in section  [ sec : comm_hom ] ) , generalizing the work from @xcite , states that if @xmath24 is a sufficiently large subgroup of @xmath1 , then every commensurating homomorphism @xmath51 is induced by an inner automorphism of @xmath1 modulo a small perturbation ( which disappears when one restricts to some finite index subgroup of @xmath24 ) . in theorem [ thm : comm_end ]",
    "we apply this result to the case when @xmath52 to obtain a characterization of commensurating endomorphisms of an acylindrically hyperbolic group .",
    "in particular , we get the following    [ cor : conj_aut ] for any acylindrically hyperbolic group @xmath1 , @xmath53 has finite index in @xmath19 . moreover , if @xmath1 has no non - trivial finite normal subgroups then @xmath20 .",
    "sections [ sec : adding ]  [ sec : techn ] of the paper develop the theory of acylindrically hyperbolic groups , which is necessary to prove the main technical theorem .",
    "in particular , in section [ sec : adding ] we investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions for adding a subgroup to an existing family of hyperbolically embedded subgroups , generalizing osin s work from @xcite ( this has also been independently done by m. hull @xcite ) .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : avr ] uses the following quite general statement :    [ thm : comm_end - raag ] let @xmath24 be a non - abelian subgroup of a finitely generated right angled artin group . then every commensurating endomorphism @xmath54 is an inner automorphism of @xmath24 .    while theorem [ thm : comm_end - raag ] employs the characterization of commensurating endomorphisms of acylindrically hyperbolic groups from theorem [ thm : comm_end ] , it is not a straightforward consequence of it , as not all subgroups of right angled artin groups are acylindrically hyperbolic .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : comm_end - raag ] occupies section [ sec : raag - end ] .    the final ingredient in the proofs of theorems [ thm : avr ] and [ thm:3-man ] is a new criterion for residual finiteness of outer automorphism groups ",
    "see proposition [ prop : new_crit ] in section [ sec : crit ] .",
    "this criterion could be of independent interest : for example , it gives a short proof of the fact that @xmath55 is residually finite for any seifert fibered space @xmath56 , which was conjectured by allenby , kim and tang in @xcite  see lemma  [ lem : seifert ] .    the last application of theorem [ thm : comm_end ] that we discuss here concerns normal endomorphisms .",
    "we will say that an endomorphism @xmath57 is _ normal _ if @xmath58 for every normal subgroup @xmath59 . normal automorphisms",
    "( with a slightly more restrictive definition requiring that @xmath60 for all @xmath59 ) have been studied by several authors before .",
    "for instance , lubotzky @xcite showed that all normal automorphisms of free groups are inner .",
    "a similar statement was proved for non - trivial free products @xcite and non - elementary relatively hyperbolic groups with trivial finite radical @xcite ; see @xcite for more results and references .",
    "it is known that every acylindrically hyperbolic group @xmath1 contains a unique maximal finite normal subgroup ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.24 ) or lemma [ lem : e_g(h ) ] below ) .",
    "this subgroup , sometimes called the _ finite radical _ of @xmath1 , will be denoted by @xmath61 ( @xmath62 is the notation used in @xcite ) , in line with lemma [ lem : e_g(h ) ] below . combining theorem [ thm : comm_end ] with the theory of dehn fillings for hyperbolically embedded subgroups , developed by dahmani , guirardel and osin in @xcite we show that almost all normal endomorphisms of acylindrically hyperbolic groups are commensurating , and so their structure is described by theorem [ thm : comm_end ] .",
    "[ thm : norm_end ] let @xmath1 be an acylindrically hyperbolic group and let @xmath57 be a normal endomorphism .",
    "then either @xmath63 or @xmath3 is commensurating .",

    "we are also grateful to henry wilton for suggesting and discussing the applications of the main result to @xmath2-manifold groups .",

    "when the map @xmath96 is clear we will abuse the notation and simply write @xmath100 instead of @xmath95 . given a word @xmath101 over @xmath91 , @xmath102 will denote the length of @xmath101 .",
