    "topologically ordered states are exotic phases of matter which do not exhibit conventional order , but are characterized by their global entanglement pattern which leads to effects such as a topological ground space degeneracy or excitations with unconventional statistics , so - called anyons .",

    "when we symmetrize on smaller regions , we additionally perform numerical studies for the symmetrized toric code model @xmath7 , for which @xmath8 , the dihedral group with @xmath9 elements , is non - abelian .",
