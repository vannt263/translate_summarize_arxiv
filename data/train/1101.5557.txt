    "the classic motivation for measuring the emission of bremsstrahlung in nucleon - nucleon collisions was the study of the off - shell behavior of the associated elastic scattering amplitude , although it is now known that off - shell effects can not be measured , even in principle .",
    "nevertheless , the bremsstrahlung reaction can provide a window into the underlying dynamical mechanisms that govern the @xmath4 interaction and the electromagnetic currents of nucleons and mesons alike .",
    "this is especially true for the hard part of the bremsstrahlung spectrum , where the photon takes a large fraction of the available center - of - mass energy . in this region",
    "the @xmath5 isobar may also play some role and the reaction has then much in common with meson production .",
    "hard bremsstrahlung has been studied in the radiative capture in neutron - proton scattering , @xmath6 , to quite high energies through the measurement of the inverse reaction of deuteron photodisintegration  @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross section provides direct evidence that one of the main driving terms is the excitation of an @xmath7-wave @xmath8 pair that de - excites through an @xmath9 transition into @xmath10 .",
    "the situation is radically different in proton - proton collisions .",
    "the analogous @xmath9 transition is forbidden for @xmath0 by angular momentum and parity conservation when the two protons emerge with very low excitation energy @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the total energy of the final @xmath1 subsystem in its rest frame  @xcite .",
    "there are therefore significant cancelations among the large amplitudes in the pure @xmath7-wave diproton limit , so that any @xmath13 effect must enter in more subtle ways .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath14 transition is generally suppressed by the vanishing of an electric dipole operator for the proton pair .",
    "it is therefore to be expected that the bremsstrahlung production rate should be much lower in @xmath1 collisions than in @xmath15 .",
    "one technique used to investigate the emission of hard bremsstrahlung in proton - proton collisions is the photodisintegration of a @xmath1 pair in @xmath16he .",
    "events where two fast protons emerge from @xmath17 are interpreted in terms of an interaction on a diproton , with the neutron merely appearing as a _ spectator _  @xcite .",
    "such data show little evidence for the presence of an intermediate @xmath8 pair , certainly much less than for those with fast @xmath18 pairs  @xcite .",
    "however , because the capture on @xmath18 spin - triplet pairs is so much stronger , the @xmath1 data extracted in this way may be contaminated by final state interactions , possibly involving @xmath15 charge exchange .",
    "this can only be checked through direct @xmath0 measurements .",
    "proton - proton bremsstrahlung has been studied in several experiments but , in general , these were undertaken by detecting the emerging protons in pairs of small counters , often placed on either side of the beam direction  @xcite , which has led to the low @xmath3 region being especially poorly sampled .",
    "the geometric acceptance was much increased in a series of refined kvi experiments at 190  mev  @xcite , but even here the low @xmath3 region was not favored . whereas the cosy time - of - flight spectrometer also has wider acceptance , the data obtained at 293  mev have only limited statistics and no attempt was made to evaluate the cross section as a function of @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "data on the hardest part of the @xmath1 bremsstrahlung spectrum were also obtained at the cosy - anke magnetic spectrometer by selecting the two final protons with @xmath19  mev  @xcite . a proton beam energy range from 353 to 800  mev was investigated but only for cm photon angles @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "the results reveal a broad peak in the cross section at an energy around 650  mev with a fwhm  @xmath22  mev .",
    "this suggests the possible influence of intermediate @xmath8 pairs , though not necessarily in a relative @xmath7-wave .",
    "much higher statistics were obtained over a wider range of @xmath1 excitation energies and photon angles at the promice - wasa facility at uppsala .",
    "the experiment was carried out at a single beam energy of @xmath23  mev and results were recently published for @xmath19  mev  @xcite .",
    "these data are completely consistent with those from anke at 353  mev over the small - angle domain covered by the anke experiment  @xcite .",
    "however , it is clear from this comparison that a reliable decomposition into multipoles requires data over a wide angular range .",
    "the low @xmath3 data from uppsala were interpreted as indicating the dominance of the @xmath14 and @xmath24 multipoles  @xcite with no evidence for any important @xmath25 contribution , in contrast to theoretical expectations  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend the analysis up to @xmath26  mev in order to test theoretical models over a wider range of excess energies .",
    "a state - of - the - art model has recently been developed that for the first time describes successfully proton - proton bremsstrahlung in the hundred mev range  @xcite .",
    "this model , which is hereinafter denoted as hn , is summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] . in this approach",
    "the photon is coupled everywhere to a relativistic @xmath1 scattering amplitude in a way that ensures consistency with gauge invariance .",
    "although this reproduces very well the detailed kvi @xmath0 measurements at 190  mev  @xcite , it is possible that at 310  mev the tail of the @xmath13 might have some influence . in this context",
    "it should be noted that the minimal inclusion of the @xmath13 isobar  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) improves the theoretical description of the 280  mev triumf data  @xcite .",
    "the experimental approach used in this work is identical to that employed at promice - wasa for pion production  @xcite and so sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] merely provide outlines of the salient points of the method and the data analysis , respectively .",
    "the results given in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] show that , away from the region of small @xmath3 values , where there can be significant cancelations between different contributions , the theory of sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] works remarkably well .",
    "it describes the photon angular distribution and those of the diproton relative momentum in different @xmath3 intervals as well as the energy dependence of the @xmath0 total cross section .",
    "the fact that the theory reproduces the absolute normalization of these high - momentum - transfer data to within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties is striking .",
    "however , the theoretical predictions of the photon angular distributions obtained without intermediate @xmath8 contributions are better at low @xmath3 than those that include them .",
    "this brings into question whether the present simplified treatment of these isobar contributions is acceptable .",
    "our conclusions and suggestions for further work are to be found in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the experimental data presented in this paper represent the most complete measurement of bremsstrahlung in proton - proton collisions at an energy so far above threshold . we therefore compare them with a refined model  @xcite that has recently been successfully applied  @xcite to describe both the triumf data at 280  mev  @xcite and the high - precision kvi data  @xcite at the lower proton energy of @xmath27  mev .",
    "this solved a long - standing discrepancy between experiment and the , then , existing theory .",
    "the novel approach is derived within a quantum field - theory formalism by coupling the photon everywhere possible to an underlying two - nucleon @xmath28-matrix that is derived from a relativistic @xmath4 scattering equation .",
    "the basic idea of the method is that introduced by haberzettl , nakayama , and krewald  @xcite for pion photoproduction , based on the field - theoretical approach of haberzettl  @xcite .",
    "the model accounts for the important interaction current in the @xmath4 bremsstrahlung reaction in a manner that is consistent with the generalized ward ",
    "takahashi identity ( wti ) , which ensures gauge invariance at the microscopic level .",
    "this feature is absent from all earlier models .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , one starts from the nucleon - nucleon @xmath28-matrix determined by the relativistic bethe ",
    "salpeter ( bs ) equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the driving two - nucleon potential .",
    "the two - nucleon propagator , @xmath31 , describes the intermediate propagation of two free non - interacting nucleons ( with individual feynman propagators @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) sharing the given fixed reaction energy .",
    "this relativistic four - dimensional equation is then reduced in a covariant manner to the three - dimensional blankenbecler  sugar ( bbs ) equation  @xcite by replacing the propagator @xmath34 by @xmath35 where @xmath36 restricts the intermediate two nucleons to be on their mass - shells in a manner that preserves the ( relativistic ) unitarity of the equation .",
    "the driving potential @xmath30 used here is based on the one - boson - exchange model developed by the bonn group  @xcite , which contains nucleonic and mesonic degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition to reproducing the low - energy @xmath1 scattering data and the deuteron properties , the resulting @xmath4 interaction fits the @xmath4 phase - shifts up to the threshold for pion production .",
    "this version is used , rather than a more modern potential , because the necessary interaction current that is fully consistent with this potential is already available from the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown to be crucial in resolving longstanding theoretical issues with the kvi data  @xcite .    by coupling the photon to the system of two interacting nucleons ,",
    "it can be shown , again following ref .",
    "@xcite , that the resulting bremsstrahlung amplitude may be written as @xmath37 where the final - state ( fsi ) and initial - state interactions ( isi ) are included through the @xmath4 @xmath28-matrices on the left and right , respectively .",
    "the basic photon production current from the two nucleons @xmath38 contains nucleonic and mesonic terms as well as a four - point contact - type term , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) .",
    "the two disconnected nucleonic terms , shown in fig .  [ fig : model](b ) and subsumed in the dual current @xmath39 , are given by @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the @xmath42 vertex for nucleon @xmath43 , @xmath32 denotes the propagator of the nucleon @xmath44 , and @xmath45 represents an implied @xmath46-function that ensures that the incoming and outgoing momenta of the intermediate nucleon @xmath44 are identical .",
    "we mention that the dynamical structure of this formulation takes care of the fact that the translation of the three - dimensional bbs reduction to the bremsstrahlung reaction must be implemented such that a physical photon can not couple to a nucleon that is on - shell before _ and _ after the coupling takes place . for more details regarding this non - trivial issue , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath47 of eq",
    ".   describes the photon coupling to the internal mechanisms of the interaction @xmath30 , i.e. , it corresponds to the interaction current . for a one - boson - exchange model of the @xmath4 interaction , such as that employed here",
    ", @xmath47 consists of mesonic and four - point contact currents . unlike the case of proton - neutron bremsstrahlung , where there is a large mesonic current contribution  @xcite , this is to a large extent suppressed for proton - proton bremsstrahlung because only neutral mesons can then be exchanged .",
    "the dominant mesonic current contributions that we include arise from the anomalous @xmath48 couplings ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "these transitions are transverse and thus can not be obtained by simply coupling the photon to the underlying @xmath4 @xmath28-matrix ; they must be inserted by hand into @xmath50 .",
    "the four - point contact current appears as a consequence of imposing gauge invariance in the form of the generalized wti on the resulting amplitude .",
    "note that the @xmath48 meson - exchange currents have no influence on this because they are purely transverse .",
    "in general , contact - type currents have very complicated microscopic dynamical structures  @xcite that can not be taken into account explicitly at present .",
    "instead , one must revert to employing generalized _ phenomenological _ contact currents , constructed such that the full reaction amplitude satisfies the generalized wti , which is necessary to ensure full gauge invariance at the microscopic level . as a consequence ,",
    "no unique determination of the reaction amplitude is possible since the wti does not constrain the transverse part of the amplitude . in the present case ,",
    "the dynamics of the hadron interactions is described in terms of _ phenomenological _ form factors .",
    "the resulting phenomenological four - point interaction currents that describe the interaction of the photon with this hadronic three - point function , therefore , are constructed purely in terms of these hadron form factors  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use our dynamical model in the analysis of the @xmath51 reaction data at a proton incident energy of 310  mev .",
    "although this is well below the maximum of @xmath13 production at about 650  mev , earlier analyses  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) of the triumf data at 280  mev  @xcite show that its inclusion can improve the agreement with data in certain geometries .",
    "we therefore investigate the effect of introducing the @xmath13 in a minimal fashion , following the application section of ref .",
    "@xcite , by implementing the @xmath13 contributions in @xmath50 at the tree - level . for this purpose",
    "two more terms , analogous to the first two on the r.h.s .  of fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) , are added , with the @xmath13 resonance replacing the intermediate nucleon @xmath52 .",
    "this @xmath13 resonance current has no bearing on gauge invariance because the @xmath53 transition vertex is purely transverse .",
    "however , in a full @xmath54 coupled - channels approach , in addition to the tree - level @xmath13 resonance current considered here , there will also be additional box - type contributions with intermediate @xmath8 and @xmath55 pairs that produce purely transverse five - point contact - type contributions to the interaction current @xmath47  @xcite . at this stage , therefore , the present minimal tree - level inclusion of the @xmath13 currents should be considered only exploratory .",
    "the bonn potential employed in the present study for generating the nucleon - nucleon @xmath28-matrix is given in momentum space ; it is therefore non - trivial to include the coulomb interaction .",
    "coulomb effects have been investigated in @xmath1 bremsstrahlung in the past  @xcite . however , the associated distortions are mainly relevant at very small @xmath1 invariant masses , a regime which has not been well sampled in most of the earlier experiments .    in order to test the influence of the coulomb interaction over the wider acceptance of the present experiment , we also consider the @xmath4 interaction based on the paris potential  @xcite .",
    "the paris work was carried out in coordinate space and includes fully the coulomb interaction  @xcite but only within the framework of the non - relativistic lippman  schwinger equation .",
    "we have therefore formally transformed this into the relativistic bbs equation by a proper redefinition of the potential , through the so - called minimal relativity factor  @xcite , in order to be able to use this interaction consistently within the present relativistic approach .",
    "the transformed interaction reproduces the same nucleon - nucleon observables for relativistic kinematics as the original one for non - relativistic kinematics .",
    "one shortcoming in the present approach for incorporating the paris potential is that , for simplicity , we have retained the production current @xmath50 calculated from the bonn potential . as a result ,",
    "the consistency of the initial and final state interactions with the production current @xmath50 is lost but , for the purpose of checking the coulomb effects , this inconsistency is not of major concern .",
    "the data of the present experiment were obtained at the the svedberg laboratory in uppsala , where a 48  mev proton beam from the cyclotron was injected into the celsius ring  @xcite , accelerated to 310  mev and then stored .",
    "an average beam - on intensity of 3  ma was achieved during an experimental data - taking period of approximately 100 hours .",
    "the measurements were carried out at the promice - wasa facility  @xcite and results at small proton - proton excitation energies have already been published  @xcite . furthermore , the @xmath56 data were obtained simultaneously with those on @xmath57  @xcite , whose results were reported in greater detail in ref .  @xcite . since the detector assembly and the measurement techniques were identical in the two experiments , and the experimental procedures and data analysis differed only in minor details , the description will here be kept quite brief .    an internal gas - jet hydrogen target , with a density of about @xmath58  @xmath59 , was used in conjunction with the stored proton beam . by operating an electron cooler throughout the experiment ,",
    "the background was reduced significantly and the counting rate increased through an improvement in the beam - target overlap .    even though the promice - wasa facility was equipped to detect high energy photons , in the bremsstrahlung study reported here , only protons were measured in the final state .",
    "after exiting the scattering chamber , the protons passed through a forward window counter ( fwc ) , a tracker , a forward trigger hodoscope ( fth ) and usually stopped in a forward range hodoscope ( frh ) .",
    "the four - quadrant scintillator of the fwc eliminated most of the beam - halo background . in order to be accepted by the main trigger , coincident protons must appear in different quadrants .",
    "events with protons in the same quadrant were allowed by a secondary trigger but , in accord with monte carlo expectations , these were very few in number and were not considered in the subsequent analysis .",
    "information on the proton angles was extracted from the fth and , even more precisely , from the tracker .",
    "events with polar angles between about @xmath60 and @xmath61 were recorded . as described fully in ref .",
    "@xcite , the energy associated with a proton track was deduced from a combination of the calculated angle - dependent range up to the entrance of the stopping scintillator and the measured light output of that detector .",
    "a few protons stopped in one of the thin dead regions between the scintillator planes and these were then assigned the energy corresponding to the midpoint of the dead layer .",
    "as an extra check on the particle identification , it was further required that both protons of an accepted event penetrate at least into the second layer of the fth , which consists of 24 spiral scintillator segments .",
    "the minimum energy of each proton was therefore 38  mev .",
    "this condition meant that all coincident pairs of protons stopped in the second frh scintillator or earlier so that there was effectively no high - energy limitation imposed by the design of the apparatus .    in the missing - mass distribution of the @xmath62 reaction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmsq ] , there are two clear peaks corresponding to @xmath63 and @xmath64 , with very little overlap . before making any detailed cuts",
    ", these peaks contained in total 66,521 @xmath65 and 861,449 @xmath66 candidates .",
    "the exclusion of events affected by the detector gaps , and those where the proton time difference fell outside a 65  ns band , eliminated 7.3% and 1.5% of these , respectively .",
    "there is only a small ( @xmath67 ) background under the @xmath68 peak that arises mainly from the rescattering of one of the protons from a pion - production reaction .",
    "the maximum polar angle of protons from @xmath69 production depends sensitively upon the proton beam energy @xmath70 .",
    "a measurement of this angle , which was close to @xmath71 , showed that @xmath72  mev .",
    "the width of the @xmath68 peak is @xmath73 . by retaining only events at a little over the two fwhm level , namely @xmath74 , to a good approximation",
    "this cut compensates for the neglect of the small background contribution  @xcite .    the angular distribution of the protons in the laboratory system for the selected @xmath0 events is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle_fit ] . in spite of a slight but significant misalignment between the beam and the detector axes ,",
    "the angular cutoffs at both small and large angles are quite sharp and very well reproduced by the monte carlo simulation that used the bonn @xmath1 potential in the model described in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "the phase - space simulation gives a marginally poorer representation , especially at large angles . in both cases",
    "the predictions have been normalized to the total number of events .    for each of the emerging protons ,",
    "a timing signal was extracted from the first of the fth spiral detectors .",
    "the time at the target position was then estimated using the information on the particle energy , the hit position in the scintillators , and the time - of - flight . the calibration , which was improved over that used in ref .",
    "@xcite , led to a distribution for the time difference between the two protons with a peak width of 1.1  ns fwhm .",
    "this was essentially the same for both the forward- and backward - going photons , though a correction was introduced to compensate for a slight offset of 0.2  ns in the forward case .",
    "cuts at @xmath75  ns applied to the data of fig .",
    "[ fig : timing ] reduced the number of accidental coincidences to less than 1% so that it was then justified to employ a kinematic fitting .",
    "this was achieved by adjusting the energies of the two protons to give zero missing mass . taken together with the sharper time difference cut , this reduced the number of candidates to the 58,026 @xmath65 events that were used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "in the case of a production reaction like @xmath0 , the unpolarized cross section is a function of four independent variables .",
    "the standard set chosen for the analysis consists of    * @xmath3 : the excitation energy in the final @xmath1 system , * @xmath20 : the cm production angle of the photon , * @xmath76 : the cm polar angle of the @xmath1 relative momentum @xmath77 with respect to the beam direction , * @xmath78 : the azimuthal angle between @xmath77 and the photon momentum .",
    "other variables , such as the laboratory proton angle that was used in the construction of fig .",
    "[ fig : angle_fit ] , can be expressed in terms of these four quantities .    in order to convert the observed numbers of events into cross sections , knowledge of the detector acceptance",
    "is needed in the four  dimensional space .",
    "this was achieved using a monte carlo simulation , where the detector system was described in great geometric detail .",
    "identical cuts were then placed on the simulated and experimental events .",
    "frequently only phase - space was used in the simulations but , in principle , the acceptances might depend significantly on the actual reaction probability .",
    "estimates were therefore made , not only for simple phase space , but also for a realistic reaction matrix , assumed to be represented by the hn model  @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the program interpolated within a lookup table of the reaction matrix yielded by this model in the four standard variables .",
    "values of the acceptance in the ( @xmath79 ) space are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : acceptance ] .",
    "it should first be noted that the promice ",
    "wasa detector only registered protons with laboratory angles less than @xmath80 and at 310  mev this means that only the region @xmath81  mev was sampled .",
    "although at low @xmath3 the acceptance could be quite large , being up to 60% , this decreased to much lower values at higher @xmath3 and small @xmath20 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : acceptance ] by showing the acceptance as a function of @xmath3 in four ranges of the photon ( cm ) angle . these are , respectively , the backwards @xmath82 ( bw ) , the backwards central @xmath83 ( bwc ) , the forwards central @xmath84 ( fwc ) , and the forwards @xmath85 ( fw ) regions . for photons emitted in the forward hemisphere ,",
    "the recoiling protons are slower and a greater fraction emerge at larger angles than allowed for in design of the promice  wasa detector , and this leads to a more severe cut at high @xmath3 .",
    "protons from these events are also more likely to be distorted by secondary interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "it also means that the beam  pipe effect kicks in at lower @xmath3 , which is also clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : acceptance ]",
    ".    due to the identical nature of the protons in the entrance channel , the @xmath0 cross section is symmetric in the cm system around @xmath86 .",
    "the effects of the variation of the acceptance with @xmath87 at large @xmath3 can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwbw ] , which shows the cross sections extracted as functions of @xmath3 in the same four regions of @xmath88 used in fig .",
    "[ fig : acceptance ] . in all cases",
    "the data were terminated when the estimated acceptance dropped below 2% , and this occurred much earlier for small values of @xmath87 . except at the edges of the acceptance , the cross sections deduced using a phase space model to evaluate the acceptance differed only marginally from those obtained on the basis of the dynamical model .",
    "the crucial forward / backward symmetry is clearly respected to within the uncertainties for @xmath89  mev but between 22 and 26  mev there is some deviation , which is more apparent in the angular distributions to be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . on general grounds",
    "one would expect the data from the forward photon hemisphere to be less reliable because the associated protons are less energetic and can emerge at larger angles .",
    "the statistics in the backward hemisphere are also much larger .",
    "the integrated luminosity of 340  nb@xmath90 was derived from a comparison of elastic proton  proton scattering results measured in parallel with tabulated cross sections , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . due to the large pre ",
    "scaling factor associated with the @xmath1 trigger used , an error bar of about 10% must be associated with this value .",
    "this includes also effects connected with the evaluation of the proton acceptance in the apparatus and any uncertainty in the @xmath1 database used in the comparison .    of the other systematic uncertainties discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , proton rescattering in the detector material might contribute 2% , as might the treatment of the background under the @xmath68 peak .",
    "although the promice  wasa geometric acceptance is very good , the extrapolation to unexplored regions and its dependence upon reaction models can give up to 3% , though this depends upon the value of @xmath3 . the known systematic uncertainty is therefore judged to be @xmath91 overall .",
    "however , despite the care taken with the calibrations and the evaluation of the acceptance , the forward / backward symmetry is not completely respected at high @xmath3 , as evidenced by the divergence between the fwc and bwc data in fig .  [",
    "fig : fwbw ] .",
    "we therefore can not exclude larger systematic uncertainties even in the backward photon hemisphere for @xmath92  mev .",
    "over 58,000 kinematically well - defined @xmath0 events are available for analysis in terms of the four - dimensional differential cross section , as described in sec .  [",
    "sec : analysis ] . in the present paper",
    "only one single differential and three double differential distributions are presented .",
    "data points are shown if the acceptance at this point is estimated to be larger than 2% .",
    "only the statistical uncertainties are shown explicitly by error bars and these do not include the @xmath91 overall systematic effects .",
    "the azimuthal dependence of the data can be quite strong but , since this seems mainly to be a reflection of the acceptance , it is not further investigated .",
    "the data would allow explorations of higher dimensionality , but further guidance from theory would be necessary to exploit this fruitfully .    the center  of  mass differential cross section in the photon angle is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang1 ] averaged over 3  mev bins in the @xmath1 excitation energy from 03  mev to 3942  mev , with the upper end of each interval being indicated in the relevant panel .",
    "the angular cuts on the data clearly reflect the acceptance dependence presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : acceptance ] .",
    "as already reported  @xcite , the data for @xmath19  mev show a strong minimum at @xmath93 and an almost pure @xmath94 behavior .",
    "the level of this minimum rises as @xmath3 increases .",
    "the data show that the @xmath95 term is generally small and its strength can not be determined with precision .",
    "the full dynamical model of haberzettl and nakayama  @xcite of sec .  [ sec : model ] has been evaluated using the bonn potential  @xcite without the @xmath13 contribution .",
    "the curves are consistent with the shapes of the angular distributions as measured in the backward hemisphere for all except the lowest @xmath3 bin .",
    "the strengths are also well described , especially in view of the uncertainties in the absolute scales of both the theory and experiment .",
    "a minimum is predicted at @xmath96 for all energy bins but for @xmath19  mev this is not sufficiently deep and there seems to be no sign there of the leveling off near the forward / backward directions expected from the theoretical model .",
    "the theoretical predictions are , of course , sensitive to the assumptions in the model .",
    "thus , when the `` minimal '' inclusion of the @xmath13 contribution is switched on in the calculation , the effects are surprisingly large and the agreement with the data is much poorer , especially at low @xmath3 where the central minimum is largely absent .",
    "the shapes are far less changed at high @xmath3 and the data there can be well reproduced if the predictions are scaled by a factor of @xmath97 .",
    "the description of the angular distributions with the paris potential  @xcite is very similar to that obtained with the bonn potential .",
    "the coulomb effects that are included here are only significant for very low @xmath3 but this is also the region where the theoretical model is least satisfactory .",
    "the second angular distribution to be discussed is that of the @xmath1 relative momentum vector @xmath77 with respect to that of the proton beam in the overall cm frame .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang2 ] in the same 3  mev bins that were used in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang1 ] .",
    "it is difficult to measure the angles of the vector @xmath77 when its magnitude is small so that any apparent deviation from isotropy for @xmath19  mev may not be significant .",
    "the data for @xmath98  mev show clear evidence of a forward dip and the predictions of the hn model  @xcite on the basis of the bonn potential follow this trend quantitatively . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ang2 ] , in this case there is very little difference in the shape of the predictions whether the @xmath13 is included or not .",
    "the lack of data for small @xmath99 at high @xmath3 is a consequence of the limited acceptance in these regions .",
    "the corresponding distribution of @xmath77 with respect to the photon direction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang3 ] .",
    "although this is evaluated in the frame of the recoiling @xmath1 pair ( the helicity distribution ) , little change would be seen if this were replaced by the overall center  of  mass frame .",
    "both the data and the models display fairly flat shapes , with the possible exception of the very low energy bins , where the drop in the data for small helicity angle @xmath100 may reflect the difficulty in measuring two protons when they emerge with similar angles and momenta .    note that the data in the three angular distributions are different representations of the same 58,026 events , so that the cross sections integrated over angle must be identical .",
    "the `` holes '' seen at various places of phase space in the diagrams indicate possible sources of systematic errors . as a consequence",
    "one must conclude that the integrated @xmath0 cross section can only be safely extracted when @xmath101  mev .",
    "the energy variation of this cross section is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwbw2 ] as a function of @xmath3 . for one of the sets of points , only results from the backward photon hemisphere ( bw + bwc ) are used .",
    "the other set uses in addition the fwc data and the forward / backward symmetry is only invoked to derive the data in the very forward region .",
    "the reasonable description of the angular distributions by the theoretical model is translated into one of the integrated cross section , where the predictions have been smeared over the @xmath102  mev bins used in the data presentation . in order to ensure agreement with the data above 10  mev ,",
    "the theoretical results that included only the nucleonic and meson - exchange current terms were scaled by factors of 1.30 and 1.45 for the bonn and paris evaluations , respectively . when the @xmath8 intermediate states are included in the minimal way described in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , the corresponding factors are 0.80 and 0.90 , respectively .    the drawback of using the bonn potential is immediately apparent . the unrealistic spike at very low @xmath3 is significantly softened when this is replaced by the paris potential , which includes the coulomb repulsion in the @xmath1 system .",
    "otherwise there is little difference between the predictions based upon the two potentials . in either case",
    "the model seems to overestimate the cross section for the production of the @xmath103 state of the two final protons .",
    "it must again be stressed that in this region there can be delicate cancelations amongst the contributions  @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath103 prediction were reduced , the energy dependence might be reproduced , though with a slightly too low overall normalization .",
    "the inclusion of the effects of the @xmath13 in an approximate way gives a rather similar description of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwbw2 ] .",
    "however , as mentioned already , the @xmath13 effects beyond the tree - level that would arise in a consistent @xmath54 coupled channels approach  @xcite , have been ignored in the present calculations . using the paris rather than",
    "the bonn potential induces changes analogous to those seen in the non-@xmath13 scenario .",
    "phase space does not provide an acceptable description of the @xmath3 dependence of the integrated cross section shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwbw2 ] .",
    "this is by no means unexpected because the spin - parity constraints associated with the @xmath103 final state are not built into such a naive approach .",
    "the total @xmath0 cross section integrated up to @xmath104  mev is @xmath105b , where the statistical error is negligible and the quoted uncertainty is purely systematic . in the cosy - tof measurement at 293",
    "mev  @xcite there were very few events with @xmath106  mev and a total cross section of @xmath107b was obtained by extrapolating to the kinematic limit on the basis of a phase - space variation . if , instead , the total cross section below 30  mev is estimated , a value of @xmath108b is found .",
    "the agreement between the cosy - tof result and ours lies well within the error bars .    in order to illustrate the variation of the angular dependence of the photon with excitation energy , the differential cross section data of fig .  [",
    "fig : ang1 ] have been fitted by @xmath109 figure  [ fig : fwbw4 ] shows the ratio @xmath110 as a function of @xmath3 compared to the predictions of the present calculation based on the hn model  @xcite .",
    "neither the prediction with or without the @xmath13 contribution can describe the rise in @xmath110 at low @xmath3 and the inclusion of the @xmath13 is particularly disappointing in this region .",
    "we have presented here detailed measurements of bremsstrahlung production in proton - proton collisions at a beam energy of 310  mev . the differences between the data extracted from the forward and backward photon hemispheres increases for excitation energies above about 20  mev and , in such cases , the backward data are more reliable because of the faster protons and the much higher acceptance . using the forward / backward symmetry of the reaction , full acceptance was achieved up to an @xmath26  mev and some information obtained even close to the kinematic limit of 42  mev imposed by design of the apparatus .",
    "the big advantage of this experiment compared to others undertaken above the pion - production threshold is the large acceptance coupled with good statistics .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the values extracted for the cross sections depend very little whether one uses phase space or the hn model to estimate the acceptance .",
    "however , to go to higher @xmath3 one would need larger counters than those provided by the promice - wasa setup .",
    "away from the very small @xmath3 region , the dynamical model of haberzettl and nakayama  @xcite , whose main points are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , is rather successful in describing all the experimental results as functions of @xmath3 provided an overall scaling factor close to unity is applied . as well as the integrated cross section ,",
    "these include the angular distributions of the photon and those of the @xmath1 relative momentum with respect to the beam direction and to that of the recoil photon .",
    "it is very gratifying to note that any rescaling of the predictions required to achieve this success is well within the combined experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the latter are clearly very hard to quantify but they must at least encompass the differences between the inclusion or not of the @xmath13 contributions .",
    "the situation at low @xmath3 is more uncertain because there are significant cancelations amongst the driving terms  @xcite and the theoretical results are therefore much more sensitive to small contributions . using the paris rather than the bonn potential in the evaluation of the model allows the coulomb interaction to be included and this does smooth the predictions slightly at low @xmath3 .",
    "however , it must be noted that the switch from bonn to paris was not done fully consistently .",
    "the good agreement between theory and experiment was obtained without considering any effects that might arise from the virtual excitation of the @xmath13 isobar .",
    "although the basic model was tuned to describe the 190  mev kvi data  @xcite , by 310  mev the influence of the @xmath13 might start to be felt . in this context",
    "it should be noted that the introduction of the @xmath13 isobar  @xcite seems to improve the theoretical description of the 280  mev triumf data  @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the inclusion of the @xmath13 effects in the minimal way described in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] actually makes the agreement with the shapes of the photon angular distribution worse for @xmath111  mev and this difference is somewhat puzzling .",
    "we view it more as an indication that @xmath13 effects are not very well understood and that minimal inclusion is not warranted in these instances , rather than as a measure of theoretical errors . further theoretical work",
    "is clearly needed and the results might be improved by introducing a phenomenological five - point contact current to take account of the @xmath8 box diagrams , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at higher @xmath3",
    "the differences are less important and the four versions of the model give very similar integrated cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwbw2 ] provided that they are scaled by factors that are all fairly close to unity . with the scaling factors as shown , the predictions start to differ from the more reliable backward - angle data above 20  mev . however , in view of the 15% overall systematic error in the data and the arbitrariness in the scaling factors one can not draw firm conclusions as to the significance of this .",
    "the very small @xmath3 region has been studied near the forward direction with the cosy - anke spectrometer up to 800  mev  @xcite .",
    "the results show an energy dependence that suggests some influence from intermediate @xmath8 pairs . however , for kinematic reasons , at these higher beam energies the @xmath68 and @xmath69 peaks , which are so prominent in the missing - mass plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : mmsq ] , merge and the extraction of a @xmath0 signal is much more delicate . under these conditions",
    "it may be necessary to measure the photon in coincidence and data of this type from the cosy - wasa facility are currently being analyzed at 500 and 550  mev  @xcite .",
    "however , it should be stressed that data in the small @xmath3 region taken at well below the pion production threshold would also be very valuable because the uncertainties regarding the inclusion of the @xmath13 contribution would then be minimized .",
    "data with polarized beam and target , along with results on the differential cross section and analyzing power , would allow some of the electromagnetic multipoles to be determined explicitly and therefore allow one to identify defects in the models more clearly  @xcite .",
    "the bremsstrahlung reaction is the simplest of all the high - momentum - transfer reactions in proton - proton collisions at intermediate energies . unlike cases of meson production ,",
    "there is no need to consider the final state interaction of the meson with one of the protons .",
    "the quality of the agreement between the predictions of a modern bremsstrahlung model with the high - statistics and high - acceptance data achieved at the promice - wasa facility is striking and should encourage further experimental and theoretical work in the field .",
    "we are very grateful to the tsl / isv personnel and the promice - wasa collaboration for their support in this experiment .",
    "we acknowledge in particular the great help provided by jozef zomaczuk in the early stages of this experiment and its analysis .",
    "we also thank the research computer center at the university of georgia and the supercomputing center at forschungszentrum jlich for providing computing resources that were necessary to obtain the theoretical results shown in the present paper .",
