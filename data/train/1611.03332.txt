    "consider first the total kinetic energy of such a system , which may be written in a special way using the center of mass velocity @xmath40 : @xmath41 the first term on the right side is the kinetic energy of the particles as observed from the frame of the center of mass of the system , whereas the second term is the kinetic energy associated with the center of mass itself .",

    "a detailed discussion on the special properties of the center of mass frame and the validity of the work - energy theorem in inertial and non - inertial frames of reference can be found in @xcite .",
    "a second example will help explain the form of the external working in and . in these expressions , the external stress @xmath34 is associated with the average material velocity @xmath47 across the shock .",
    "this pairing also arises during the collision of two rigid bodies , where the working of the impact is the product of the impulse with the mean of the relative velocities describing approach and separation .",
    "the derivation we reproduce here is essentially that of article 308 of thomson and tait @xcite , and is an elementary result in impact mechanics @xcite .",
    "the change in kinetic energy due to a two - particle collision is @xmath48 where the symbols for initial and final velocities of particle 1 and particle 2 are straightforward , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the approach and separation velocities , and @xmath51 is the impulse experienced by each particle due to the collision .",

    "our problem corresponds to the case where one `` particle '' is a stationary obstacle .",
    "our definition of the working of the source of momentum @xmath34 differs from the approaches taken by oreilly @xcite and virga @xcite , who associate @xmath34 with the spatial velocity of the non - material point @xmath4 corresponding to the shock .",

    "they proposed the concept of a `` driving traction '' as a dynamic conjugate to the material velocity @xmath17 of a strain discontinuity in a bulk solid or unkinked , extensible bar .",
    "if the driving traction vanishes everywhere on the surface of discontinuity , the motion is dissipation - free .",
    "purohit and bhattacharya @xcite derived a thermomechanical expression for the driving force associated with a moving phase boundary in a kinked string made of a phase - transforming material .",

    ", the expression can be rewritten in an informative way in terms of the jumps in tension and tangents , @xmath54 this expression indicates that a propagating shock conserves translation - invariant energy if either the tensions across the shock are identical , or the tangents are continuous .",
    "a similar observation about the tension was made by calkin and march @xcite for the case of a falling folded chain , where reduces to @xmath55 , in agreement with equation ( 12 ) of @xcite , and the @xmath56 in equation ( 12 ) of @xcite is twice the shock speed , @xmath57 . ] .",
    "we discuss that problem in appendix [ falling ] .    the energy supply at the shock defined by differs from equation ( 2.25 ) of virga @xcite by the geometric factor @xmath58 .",
    "this difference arises due to virga s choice of the spatial velocity @xmath59 of the non - material point of discontinuity , @xmath60 as conjugate to the external force @xmath34 , in contrast to our choice of the average spatial velocity of material points @xmath47 . from the above expression",
    ", we note that this average is simply the portion of @xmath59 that is not translation - invariant .",
    "although the energy supply derived in @xcite does not display any dependence on the the jump in tangents , virga assumes a constitutive law in equation ( 2.27 ) of @xcite which does . in our derivation ,",
    "the geometric dependence arises naturally from our splitting of the total energy supply",
    ". however , equation ( 2.25 ) of @xcite , which virga derives from a rayleigh dissipation principle , can also be obtained from a different rearrangement of the energy jump condition . substituting for @xmath47 from into equation ( [ energy_rewritten_2 ] ) , and using and",
    ", @xmath61 then using to insert for @xmath34 in the third term on the right , along with the identity @xmath62 , @xmath63 by defining the dissipation @xmath64 , one obtains virga s equation ( 2.25 ) in @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ virga_3 ] ) also agrees with equation ( 34 ) of oreilly @xcite without director terms .",
    "the quantity @xmath65 there is called the source of `` material momentum '' , and in our example would correspond to @xmath66 in . in another paper @xcite , oreilly derives an additional configurational momentum balance law and shows that , given this additional balance , the energy jump condition reduces to an identity relating the power expended by the singular supplies of linear and material momentum .",
    "similarly , if one uses the momentum and energy balances , oreilly s configurational balance reduces to an identity .    finally , we write general expressions for the stresses in the vicinity of the shock in terms of the singular supplies and the geometry .",
    "consider the momentum jump condition in the form . projecting it onto the jump in tangents and rearranging ,",
    "we obtain the tension sum @xmath67 the tension jump can be obtained from the energy jump in the form , @xmath68 thus , the tensions on either side of the shock are found to be @xmath69 these expressions will be used in appendix [ falling ] .",
    "the momentum and energy supplies can not be arbitrarily prescribed . eliminating @xmath66 between and",
    ", we obtain the following relation between the supplies , @xmath70 this relation places no assumptions on the kinematics of the system , and is applicable to steady or unsteady motions",
    ". we will use it in section [ admissibility ] to derive qualitative results about the admissibility of geometric discontinuities during pick - up and impact . here",
    "we make a couple of general observations , valid as long as the body is not perfectly folded back , in which case @xmath25 and both sides of the relation would all vanish .",
    "given a non - zero jump in tangents @xmath26 , it is impossible to inject momentum into the shock without injecting or dissipating energy unless the momentum injection @xmath34 is orthogonal to the sum of tangents @xmath25 , that is , in the direction of the jump .",
    "oreilly and varadi @xcite have observed that this fact is inconsistent with some assumptions appearing in the literature on space - fixed loads acting on axially moving or rotating structures",
    ".    given that the sign of the shock speed depends on a physically irrelevant parameterization , the sign of the energy supply @xmath46 depends entirely on the orientation of the momentum supply @xmath34 relative to the sum of tangents @xmath25 .",
    "letting @xmath17 be negative , as it would be for an axially moving string parameterized in the direction of the axial flow , a positive projection @xmath71 would imply a supply of energy at the shock , a negative projection dissipation .",
    "before considering dissipative shocks , it is worthwhile to look at cases where @xmath72 . as mentioned earlier , equation for the energy jump indicates that either the tension or the tangents must be continuous if @xmath72 , that is , @xmath73 meanwhile , the compatibility relation indicates that at least one of the following conditions must hold if @xmath72 .",
    "either @xmath74    conditions and are the same .",
    "it turns out that conditions and are also equivalent , in that if @xmath75 , equation reduces to @xmath76 , so that holds by orthogonality of the sum and jump of tangents in our inextensible string .",
    "although the conditions ( [ jump_sigma_zero ] ) and ( [ momentum_projection_zero ] ) are equivalent , the latter is more useful . the momentum injection @xmath34 is often provided by an external obstacle or tool , so it may be possible to infer something about its orientation from the physical attributes of this object .",
    "information about the tension on either side of the shock is usually harder to determine .",
    "there exists a third possibility , given by equation ( [ momentum_jump_zero ] ) .",
    "here there is no supply of momentum at the shock , and the sum of tangents across the shock is non - zero , meaning that the body is not perfectly folded back on itself . to understand this case better ,",
    "let us look at the momentum jump condition written in the sum - jump basis .",
    "assume a kink , such that the jump in tangents is also non - zero .",
    "in this case , the only solutions for which @xmath77 would require @xmath78 .",
    "this condition obtains for the axially - flowing lariats @xcite , for which the configuration @xmath31 is arbitrary and @xmath79 .",
    "kinks are compatible with these solutions @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized that the condition @xmath80 is not sufficient for conservation of translation - invariant energy .",
    "it can be inferred from that a non - zero @xmath46 can still exist if the sum @xmath20 .",
    "the falling folded chain discussed in appendix [ falling ] is an example of such a case @xcite .",
    "in this section , we use the compatibility relation to determine whether a discontinuity in tangents is admissible in certain physical circumstances .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that such a propagating kink will be dissipative , so that @xmath46 is non - positive ( for an exception to this , see appendix [ peel ] ) . with this assumption , and a parameterization such that @xmath81 , we find @xmath82 with the equality holding for @xmath72 .",
    "this inequality restricts the directions of @xmath34 relative to the sum of tangents .",
    "since the momentum injection comes from the interaction of the string with an external source , the physical settings of the system may dictate whether this source is capable of providing a @xmath34 in a direction consistent with .",
    "for example , a smooth , frictionless , non - adhesive surface can only provide a @xmath34 pointing outwards in the direction of the surface normal .",
    "the assumption of the non - positivity of @xmath46 , as defined in , can be examined in the light of the total energy balance .",
    "the implication is that @xmath83 , meaning that the rate of change of the total energy across the shock @xmath35 can not be greater than the rate at which work is done on the material at the shock @xmath84 by external forces .",
    "the difference between the two quantities tells us about the translation - invariant energy being dissipated in the shock .",

    "a ball - and - link chain is pulled at several m / s to the left over a smooth surface .",
    "a retractable blade near the right hand side creates a `` bubble '' in the chain . after the blade retracts ,",
    "the disturbance moves freely to the left and eventually dies down .",
    "while this is not a steady - state configuration , the tangential speed of the chain is nearly constant , and is quite rapid compared to the shape dynamics .",
    "many of the features we discuss above are apparent .",
    "the bump provides a sideways reaction force that can sustain a pick - up kink ; once it is retracted , the pick - up point becomes smooth .",
    "later , the impact point undergoes a transition from smooth to kinked .",
    "we have examined a simple mechanical system , and made a surprising prediction that appears to have gone unnoticed in the literature , but is consonant with previous experimental observations .",
    "a kink in a flexible structure is generally inadmissible during pick - up .",
    "this statement follows from a compatibility relation between stress and translation - invariant power supplies , along with basic assumptions about the reaction stress , at the contact discontinuity .",
    "while our conclusion is based on excluding exceptional solutions for which there is no reaction stress ( including lariat - type solutions ) , which we have only been able to do explicitly for steady - state configurations , the limited experimental evidence suggests that the conclusions are more broadly applicable .    at the discontinuity , we supplemented momentum conservation with energy conservation , while allowing for source terms .",
    "these jumps reflect shifts in spatial and temporal coordinates .",
    "an alternative is to use a balance of some configurational - like or `` material '' quantity @xcite , reflecting pure boundary motion or shifts in material coordinates .",
    "the simple example of an inextensible string allowed us to use a very convenient orthogonal pair , the sum and jump of tangents , to transparently express vector quantities and perform calculations .",
    "a non - orthogonal pair , the sum and jump of velocities , was used to isolate the translation - invariant part of the energy .",
    "a natural consequence of our energy splitting is that the external stress supply is paired with the average velocity across the kink , in keeping with basic concepts in particle impact mechanics .",
    "this leads to the compatibility relation used in our analysis .",
    "an immediate question is , how do these concepts extend to more complicated one - dimensional bodies ?",
    "we expect that stretching will complicate the problem without providing much new physics , at least for a hyperelastic material with convex elastic energy .",
    "however , higher - order discontinuities in rods and other structures with bend and twist resistance are potentially interesting .",
    "recent experiments on `` torsional locomotion '' show how such structures can be propelled away from partial constraints by jumps in curvature or twist @xcite .",
    "other ways of looking at these problems might consider the dynamics of the geometry , or of the non - material point of contact .",
    "an example problem in which the latter type of formulation is possible , given certain assumptions about the geometry and dissipation , is discussed in appendix [ falling ] .",
    "consider a chain fixed at one end , while the other end falls after being released from rest in a perfectly folded configuration ( figure [ falling_folded_chain ] ) .",
    "this problem has a history as a challenging and counterintuitive example in dynamics @xcite , and also sees application in the context of cable deployment from orbiting spacecraft @xcite and recreational bungee jumping ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "from the perspective of the current paper , the perfectly folded chain is a special configuration where the sum of tangents @xmath120 . additionally , there is no external source @xmath34 , and our compatibility relation is satisfied identically for any arbitrary choice of internal dissipation @xmath46 .",
    "we will combine the general expressions with a constitutive prescription for @xmath46 to recover virga s @xcite results for this problem .",
    "the prescription may be derived from oreilly and varadi s general prescription for the jump in tension in equation ( 7.7 ) of @xcite , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a constitutive parameter .",
    "substituting in prescribes @xmath46 as @xmath123 or , using velocity compatibility , as @xmath124 which agrees with equation ( 9 ) of @xcite and equation ( 4.1 ) of @xcite .",
    "with @xmath34 set to zero and a constitutive prescription of @xmath46 specified , the bulk equation @xmath125 can be projected onto the tangents on each side and integrated , with providing the boundary conditions at the fold . using the form",
    ", we obtain the boundary conditions @xmath126 for these kinematics , velocity compatibility indicates that @xmath127 , and thus @xmath128 on the falling side . integrating the projected bulk equation @xmath129 and using @xmath130 at the free end",
    ", we obtain @xmath131 evaluating this at @xmath132 and using , we may write a differential equation for the dynamics of the shock , @xmath133 in agreement with the free - end case of equation ( 6.6 ) of @xcite . similarly , the reaction force at the support can be obtained by integrating the bulk equation and employing the boundary condition at the fold .",
    "we obtain @xmath134 in agreement with equation ( 6.7 ) of @xcite .",
    "the freedom to prescribe @xmath46 is a special feature of the perfectly folded chain that can not be used in more realistic configurations such as those of the experiments in @xcite .",
    "without gravity and with a stationary contacting piece adhered to the surface .",
    "the reaction stress @xmath34 points antiparallel to the jump in tangents.,width=302 ]    peeling @xcite is a moving - boundary problem related to standard adhesion tests , and sometimes used as a toy model of fracture .",
    "interesting inertial and material instabilities have been observed in peeling tapes @xcite . in this appendix ,",
    "we briefly show how classical quasi - static results relate to our approach .",
    "consider a tape peeled from a from a plane rigid surface , as in figure [ peeling_full ] .",
    "the stress supply @xmath34 for an adhesive surface can point in any direction . to obtain the power balance , we modify the lagrangian density to be @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the internal energy density of the system , a quantity we will relate to the adhesion energy below . the jump condition is modified accordingly , @xmath137 note that in a typical analysis of this problem , @xmath138 . from the pick - up kinematics ( section [ admissibility ] ) , we know then that @xmath139 .",
    "let us write @xmath140 where @xmath141 , a positive number , is the surface adhesion energy and @xmath142 is the thickness of the tape .",
    "in the quasi - static limit ( @xmath143 ) , the assumption that @xmath144 along with the association @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the magnitude of the axial pull force and @xmath147 is the width of the tape , recovers the inextensible limit of the rivlin - kendall result @xcite @xmath148 where @xmath108 .",
    "note two special cases . if the peeling angle @xmath149 , peeling can not occur , while if the adhesion energy @xmath150 , the peeling angle must be zero , a situation akin to our pick - up problem in section [ admissibility ] .",
    "if we rearrange in the manner performed in the main text , we obtain @xmath151 we now recognize that @xmath152 , meaning that the peeled tape has a higher translation - invariant energy density than the adhered tape , corresponding to an `` injection '' of energy @xmath153 .",
    "this implies from that the tension @xmath154 is continuous for a kink , and thus from we see that @xmath34 points in the direction of the jump in tangents ( antiparallel with the jump for a positive tension , as shown in figure [ peeling_full ] ) .",
    "the compatibility relation of section [ compatibility ] will be @xmath155 which is satisfied by having @xmath152 and @xmath156 .",
    "the quasi - static rivlin - kendall result was also obtained by pede and co - workers @xcite , who employed a configurational balance instead of an energy balance .",
    "variations on another classic variable - mass problem @xcite that have attracted much recent interest involve the deployment of a string - like body from a loose , stationary pile .",
    "as these variations are often improperly conflated , we briefly summarize known results here .",
    "two types of chain are typically used in experiments .",
    "a link chain offers essentially no bending resistance , though may offer some hard - wall twist resistance if sufficiently twisted .",
    "a ball - and - link chain offers a hard - wall bending resistance if sufficiently bent .",
    "pulling one end of either type of chain with constant velocity leads to the formation of a small arch - like structure near the pile .",
    "the ball - and - link chain pushes back on the pile @xcite , while the link chain does not @xcite .",
    "if the ball - and - link chain s deployment is an accelerated motion driven by gravity , a large arch known as a `` chain fountain '' forms @xcite .",
    "if observed for long enough , the structure resembles a very noisy catenary .",
    "the effect is small , if present at all , in a link chain , and so appears to require the existence of a push - back effect arising from bending resistance @xcite .",
    "the smaller arch structure formed by either type of chain has been observed on short time scales , where gravity may be ignored . though it does not require a bending push - back , we speculate that its formation may be connected to the twist resistance of the chain .",
    "we recall from section [ admissibility ] that the effects discussed in the present paper have been observed in both types of chain .",
    "both biggins @xcite and virga @xcite have proposed models of the chain fountain which are not consistent with the analysis in the present paper .",
    "they make assumptions to simplify the geometry and kinematics of the system which violate velocity compatibility ( and thus indirectly conservation of mass ) and/or require energy injection .",
    "both authors seem aware of these limitations , and our present treatment is also unable to capture the experimental observations of these deployment phenomena .",
    "likewise , it was recognized by oreilly and varadi @xcite that textbook treatments of similar string problems lead to impossibilities when they beg the question of the geometry and kinematics .",
    "it is clear from the analysis in this paper that the question of matching a concave - down catenary with a surface - contacting piece is not trivial .",
    "we conclude that the geometry of these problems is likely to be a dynamic , three - dimensional one .",
    "the chain bubble demo of figure [ bubble ] was designed and filmed by r. b. warner during his time as an undergraduate researcher in our group .",
