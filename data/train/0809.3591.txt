    "modelling the dynamics of vehicular traffic flow by cellular automata has constituted the subject of intensive research by statistical physics during the past years @xcite .",
    "_ city traffic _ was an early simulation target for statistical physicists @xcite .",
    "evidently the optimisation of traffic flow at a single intersection is a preliminary but crucial step to achieve the ultimate task of global optimisation in city networks @xcite .",
    "nagatani proposed the first model for simulation of two crossing streets @xcite .",
    "subsequently , ishibashi and fukui developed similar models @xcite .",
    "recently , physicists have notably attempted to simulate the traffic flow at intersections and other traffic designations such as roundabouts @xcite . in principle , the vehicular flow at the intersection of two roads can be controlled via two distinctive schemes . in the first scheme",
    ", the traffic is controlled without traffic lights @xcite . in the second scheme , signalised traffic lights control the flow . in ref.@xcite , we have modelled the traffic flow at a single intersection with open boundary conditions on streets .",
    "dependence of waiting times on signalisation and inflow rates were investigated in details . along this line of study ,",
    "our objective in this paper is to study in some depth , the characteristics of traffic flow and its optimisation in a single intersection with closed boundary condition .",
    "we will compare our results to those obtained in our recent study of a nonsignalised intersection @xcite . in order to capture the basic features of this problem",
    ", we have constructed a ns cellular automata model .",
    "this paper has the following layout . in section",
    "ii , the model is introduced and formulated . in sections",
    "iii and iv , the results of monte carlo simulations of each controlling scheme are exhibited .",

    "imagine two perpendicular one dimensional closed chains each having @xmath0 sites .",
    "the chains represent urban roads accommodating unidirectional vehicular traffic flows .",
    "they intersect each other at the middle sites @xmath1 on the first and the second chain . with no loss of generality",
    "we take the flow direction in the first chain from south to north and in the second chain from east to west .",
    "( see fig.1 for illustration ) .",
    "cars are not allowed to turn .",
    "the discretisation of space is such that each car occupies an integer number of cells denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the car position is denoted by the location of its head cell .",
    "time elapses in discrete steps of @xmath3 and velocities take discrete values @xmath4 in which @xmath5 is the maximum velocity .        to be more specific , at each step of time , the system is characterized by the position and velocity configurations of cars .",
    "the system evolves under the nagel - schreckenberg ( ns ) dynamics @xcite .",
    "let us now specify the physical values of our time and space units .",
    "the length of each car is taken 4.5 metres .",
    "therefore , the spatial grid @xmath6 ( cell length ) equals to @xmath7 .",
    "we take the time step @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , we adopt a speed - limit of @xmath9 . the value of @xmath5 is so chosen to give the speed - limit value @xmath10 or equivalently @xmath11 . in this regard",
    ", @xmath5 is given by the integer part of @xmath12 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath13 , @xmath5 equals @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , each discrete increments of velocity signifies a value of @xmath15 which is also equivalent to the acceleration . for @xmath13",
    "this gives the comfort acceleration @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , we take the value of random breaking parameter at @xmath17 .",
    "a set of traffic lights controls the traffic flow .",
    "we discuss two types of signalisation in this paper : _ fixed - time _ and _ traffic responsive_.",
    "in this scheme the lights periodically turn into red and green .",
    "the period @xmath18 , hereafter referred to as _ cycle time _ ,",
    "is divided into two phases . in the first phase with duration @xmath19 , the lights are green for the northward street and red for the westward one . in the second phase which lasts for @xmath20",
    "timsteps the lights change their colour i.e. ; they become red for the northward and green for the westward street .",
    "the gap of all cars are update with their leader vehicle except those two which are the nearest approaching cars to the intersection .",
    "these two cars need special attention . for these approaching cars gap",
    "should be adjusted with the signal in its red phase . in this case , the gap is defined as the number of cells right after the car s head to the intersection point @xmath21 . if the head position of the approaching car lies in the crossing point the gap is zero .",
    "we note that at the time step when the traffic light goes red for a direction , portion of a car from that direction can occupy the crossing point . in this case the leading car of the queue in the other direction should wait until the passing car from the crossing point completely passes the intersection i.e. ; its tail cell position become larger than @xmath21 .",
    "now all the computational ingredients for simulation is at our disposal .",
    "the streets sizes are @xmath22 and we take @xmath13 . the system is update for @xmath23 time steps .",
    "after transients , two streets maintain steady - state currents denoted by @xmath24 and @xmath25 which are defined as the number of vehicles passing from a fixed location per time step .",

    "this seems natural because by increasing @xmath19 the model tends to a normal ns model .",

    "it is a well - established fact that a local defect can affect the low dimensional non - equilibrium systems on a global scale .",

    "the existence of a wide plateau region indicates that street @xmath37 can maintain a constant flow capacity for a wide range of density variations in the first street .",

    "keeping @xmath46 constant , the length as well as the height of the hd region decreases with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "this is expected since by increasing @xmath19 the cars in the first street are given more time to pass the intersection and less cars will have to stop at red periods . right after the crossing point , we observe a quick relaxation of the density profile to a low density region ( hereafter referred to as ld ) .",
    "it would be natural to interpret the length of the hd region as the average queue length .",
    "we note that small oscillation in the profiles are not associated to inadequacy of simulation time .",
    "in fact their emergence is related to the updating rules of the ns model .",

    "in this section we present our simulations results for the _ so - called _ intelligent controlling scheme in which the traffic light cycle is no longer fixed @xcite . in this scheme which is some times called _ traffic responsive _ , the signalisation of traffic lights is simultaneously adapted to traffic status in the vicinity of intersection .",
    "this scheme has been implemented in simulation of traffic flow at intersections with open - boundary conditions @xcite . there",
    "exist numerous schemes in which traffic responsive signalisation can be prescribed .",

    "the signal remain red for a street until the length of the corresponding queue formed behind the red light exceeds the cut - off length @xmath47 . at this moment",

    "the appearance of such behaviour remarks the adaptation of traffic lights in the responsive scheme .        to shed some light onto the problem , we sketch space - time plots of vehicles . it is seen that in traffic responsive scheme , the cars spatial distribution is more homogeneous which is due to randomness in cycle times .",
    "lastly , we compare our results to those obtained in simulation of a nonsignalised intersection @xcite . in a nonsignalised intersection ,",
    "the cars yield to each other upon approaching the crossing point and the priority is give to the car which is closer to the crossing point .",

    "it can be concluded that signalisation strategies are apparently more efficient in comparison to non - signalisation scheme .",

    "the overall throughput from the intersection shows a significant dependence on the cycle time in the fixed time scheme and on the queue cut - off length in the responsive scheme .",
    "moreover , by plotting the density profiles , we have been able to quantify the characteristics of queues .",
    "comparison to our previous results for a nonsignalised intersection shows the higher efficiency of the signalisation strategy .",
    "we remark that our approach is open to serious challenges .",

    "we emphasize that our model suffers from non realistic behaviour of car movement when the lights turn green .",
    "the crucial point is to model the braking and accelerating as realistic as possible .",
