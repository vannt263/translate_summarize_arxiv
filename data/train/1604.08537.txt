    "the study presents stark broadening parameters ( widths and shifts ) of b iv spectral lines calculated using the impact semi - classical perturbation formalism @xcite .",
    "b iv is a helium - like ion and such ions are rather commonly used for the diagnostic @xcite of laboratory @xcite and astrophysical plasmas @xcite .    in astrophysics , stark broadening data for various atomic and ionic lines ( since we do not know _ a priori _ the chemical composition of a star ) are of particular interest especially for white dwarfs , where this line broadening mechanism is usually the principal one @xcite .",
    "this broadening mechanism may be of interest and for the main sequence stars , especialy for a type and late b type @xcite .",
    "we note as well the increasing astrophysical importance of stark broadening data for various atoms and ions of trace elements , without astrophysical meaning before the development of satellite born telescopes which now are providing high - resolution spectra of earlier inaccessible quality .",
    "well - resolved line profiles for many white dwarfs , where stark broadening is important , have been and will be provided for example by the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) and goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) , far ultraviolet spectroscopy explorer ( fuse ) , the international ultraviolet explorer and others .",
    "data on boron lines , including stark broadening , are of interest in astrophysics but also for example for laboratory @xcite , fusion @xcite and laser produced @xcite plasmas investigations as well as for laser research and development @xcite . in astrophysics ,",
    "the light elements lithium , beryllium , and boron are of great interest for two sets of reasons , which might be categorized as cosmological and related to stellar structure @xcite .",
    "a general trend in nature is that the abundance of the elements versus the mass number draws a globally decreasing curve @xcite .",
    "however , the rare and fragile light nuclei , lithium , beryllium and boron are not generated in the normal course of stellar nucleosynthesis ( except @xmath0li , in the galactic disk ) and are , in fact , destroyed in stellar interiors .",
    "the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) theory is not effective to explain the generation of @xmath1li , @xmath2be , @xmath3b , @xmath4b @xcite , what is reflected in the low abundance of these simple species .",
    "consequently the origin and evolution of boron , are of particular interest and the corresponding stark broadening data are needed @xcite .    the importance of light element abundance for the giant - branch evolution is underlined in @xcite .",
    "the stellar structure interest steems from the fact that li , be and b undergo nuclear reactions at relatively low temperatures , approximately 2.5 , 3.5 , and 5 @xmath5 k at densities similar to those in the sun .",
    "since these temperatures are reached not far below the convection zone and well outside the core in solar - type stars , circulation and destruction of the light elements can result in observable abundance changes .",
    "observations of these changes can provide an invaluable probe of stellar structure and mixing .",
    "both li and be abundances are greatly reduced in the giants from their initial main - sequence values .",
    "@xcite report the b abundance of two giants and one dwarf in the hyades , the latter included to evaluate explicitly the boron abundance prior to giant - branch evolution .",
    "they demonstrate empirically that boron contributes to the absorption spectra of cool stars .",
    "hst measurements of boron abundances of these objects have permitted a test of one of the basic predictions of stellar evolution theory : the growth of the convection zone as a star evolves up the giant branch .",
    "@xcite report on the base of hubble space telescope goddard high resolution spectrograph spectra , the boron abundance derived for the young orion solar - type member bd - 05@xmath61317 .",
    "they note that , the real interstellar boron abundance and its comparison with the stellar values remains uncertain .",
    "determinations of the orion associations boron abundance provide unexpected results .",
    "the boron abundance derived from spectra of b - type stars is consistent with the expectation that the boron abundance of the orion association should be similar to that of the solar system , but is considerably higher than the interstellar boron abundance for several lines of sight , including some toward orion .",
    "a low boron abundance raises the question as to how the boron abundance of interstellar gas and young stars has decreased by a factor of 4 or 5 since the solar system was formed @xcite .",
    "the light trace elements lithium , beryllium , and boron are at the center of astrophysical puzzles involving topics as diverse as the primordial fireball , interstellar ( is ) or even intergalactic space , and stellar surfaces and interiors @xcite .",
    "this role arises because boron nuclei are destroyed by warm protons , and thus even quite shallow mixing of the atmosphere with the interior reduces the surface abundance by bringing boron - depleted material to the surface . in @xcite , a study on boron abundance of b - type stars has been presented .",
    "boron alone is observable in hot stars where stark broadening is not negligible or important . a principal goal of most of these studies of hot stars was to establish the present - day boron abundance in order to improve our understanding of the galactic chemical evolution of boron . boron in hot stars , like lithium in cool stars , is shown to be a tracer of some of the various processes afecting a stars surface composition that are not included in the standard models of stellar evolution .",
    "if the initial boron abundances of local hot stars are similar from star to star and association to association , then the large spread in boron abundances , a factor of at least 30 across their sample , shows that boron abundances are a clue to unraveling the nonstandard processes that afect young hot stars .",
    "we note that in hot stars stark broadening is often needed for the determination of abundances and in @xcite are analysed errors in abundances if it is not taken into account , especially for a - type stars .",
    "spectral lines of the boron ions have been observed in stellar spectra .",
    "b i lines have been observed in f and g stars @xcite , b ii in hotter stars @xcite and b iii in early b stars @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite found b iii lines in 44 early b stars .",
    "recently , we have calculated stark broadening parameters for 36 b iv multiplets @xcite . to complete as much as possible the corresponding stark broadening data needed in astrophysics , laboratory- , technological- , fusion- , and laser produced - plasma physics , our aim is to present in this work new theoretical determinations of stark broadening parameters ( full widths at half intensity and shifts ) within the impact semiclassical perturbation approach for additional 121 helium like boron ( b iv ) multiplets , so that that semiclassical perturbation stark widths for 157 b iv multiplets will be available .",
    "moreover , in @xcite data are provided only for an electron density of @xmath7 @xmath8 , while here , stark broadening parameters are calculated for wide range of perturber densities .",
    "obtained results will be used for the consideration of regulariries within spectral series , as well as for one example of the influence of stark broadening in comparison with doppler broadening on b iv lines in do white dwarfs .",
    "pressure broadening of spectral lines arises when an atom , ion , or molecule which emits or absorbs light in a gas or plasma , is perturbed by its interactions with the other particles of the medium .",
    "interpretation of this phenomenon is currently used for modelling of the medium and for spectroscopic diagnostics , since the broadening of the lines depends on the temperature and density of the medium .",
    "the physical conditions in the universe are very various , and collisional broadening with charged particles ( stark broadening ) appears to be important in many domains .",
    "for example , at temperatures around 10@xmath9 k and densities 10@xmath10 - 10@xmath11 @xmath8 , stark broadening is of interest for modelling and analysing spectra of a and b type stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in white dwarfs ,",
    "especially stark broadening is the dominant collisional line broadening mechanism in all important layers of the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the theory of stark broadening is well applied , especially for accurate spectroscopic diagnostics and modelling .",
    "this requires the knowledge of numerous profiles , especially for trace elements , as boron in this case , which are used as useful probes for modern spectroscopic diagnostics .",
    "interpretation of the spectra of white dwarfs , which are very faint , allows understanding the evolution of these very old stars , which are close to death .",
    "the results for stark broadening parameters of helium like boron ( b iv ) multiplets have been calculated using the semi - classical perturbation formalism @xcite.we note that different later inovations and optimizations of this theoretical method have been described in details in @xcite . within this theory the fwhm - full width at half intensity maximum ( w ) and the shift ( d ) of an isolated line , originating from the transition between the initial level @xmath12 and the final level @xmath13 is expressed for an ionized atom as :    @xmath14    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are perturbing levels , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the electron density and the velocity of perturbers respectively , @xmath20 is the maxwellian distribution of electron velocities , and @xmath21 the impact parameter of the free electron colliding with the emitter .",
    "the inelastic cross sections @xmath22 ( respectively @xmath23 ) , can be expressed by an integration of the transition probability @xmath24 , over the impact parameter @xmath21 as :    @xmath25    and the elastic contribution to the width is given by :    @xmath26    @xmath27    here @xmath28 is the elastic cross section , while @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , are phase shifts due to the polarization and quadrupolar potential respectively , and are defined in section 3 of chapter 2 in @xcite .",
    "the cut - offs @xmath33,@xmath34 , @xmath35 , and the debye radius @xmath36 , as well as the symmetrization procedure are described in section 1 of chapter 3 in @xcite .",
    "the contribution of feshbach resonances , @xmath37 is explained in @xcite .    within the semiclassical perturbation theory",
    "is assumed that electrons are moving along hyperbolic paths due to attractive coulomb force , while in the case of ionic perturbers this force is repulsive , so that trajectories are different . for ion - impact broadening",
    "the formulae are analogous to eqs .",
    "( 1 ) - ( 3 ) for electron - impact broadening , but in the case of ion broadening there is no term for the contribution of feshbach resonances .",
    "if the considered lines are isolated , the line profile @xmath38 has lorentzian form and can be expressed as :    @xmath39    where    @xmath40    and @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the energies of initial and final state , respectively . consequently , if we know stark width @xmath43 and shift @xmath44 it is easy to determine the profile of a considered spectral line .",
    "we have calculated here , within the frame of semiclassical perturbation method @xcite , electron- , proton- , and helium ion - impact broadening parameters , full width at half maximum of intensity ( fwhm - w ) and shift ( d ) for 157 transitions of b iv , for temperatures of 50 000k , 100 000 k , 200 000 k and 500 000k and perturber densities from 10@xmath45 to 10@xmath46 @xmath8 .",
    "energy levels needed for these calculations , have been taken from @xcite , while for the needed oscillator strengths @xcite method has been used , together with the tables of @xcite and the article of @xcite for higher levels .",
    "we note here , that experimental lifetimes for levels corresponding to 385.0  and 1170 can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , for semiclassical perturbation calculations of stark broadening parameters we need a consistent set of oscillator strengths and if we use a mixture of oscillator strengths obtained with various methods this may result in worse agreement with experimental data for stark broadening , as shown in @xcite , since the corresponding summation rule for oscillator strengts for transitions starting or ending on a particular energy level , may be violated .",
    "the complete results for all 157 transitions , are provided in electronic , computer readable form , as additional data in the on line journal editionas as tables s1-s7 . in table",
    "s1 are results for 10@xmath45 @xmath8 and in tables s2-s7 for 10@xmath47 to 10@xmath46 @xmath8 .",
    "as an example , here are given in table 1 , the results for two transitions as a sample in order to demonstrate the form of additional data .",
    "it should be noticed that wavelengths in table 1 as well as in tables s1-s7 differs from experimental ones since they are calculated . since the stark broadening parameter calculation depends only on relative positions of energy levels they do not depend on absolute positions of energy levels when expressed in angular frequency units . the stark width in ",
    "may be expressed in angular frequency units using the formula :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the speed of light .",
    "if a correction of the width or shift for the difference between calculated and experimental wavelength is necessary this can be made for the width , and similarly for the shift as :    @xmath50    here , with @xmath43@xmath51 is denoted the corrected width , @xmath52@xmath53 is the experimental , @xmath52 the calculated wavelength and @xmath43 the width from table 1 , or tables s1-s7 .    a parameter _ c _",
    "@xcite , provided in table 1 and tables 1s-7s , enables to determine the maximal perturber density when the line may be considered as isolated , by division of _ c _ with the corresponding full width at half maximum .",
    "the validity of impact approximation is checked for all results estimating the value of _ nv _ , where _ v _ is the collision volume and _ n _ the perturber density . if _ _",
    "nv__@xmath54 0.1 , we assume that the impact approximation is valid @xcite . if _ _ nv__@xmath55 0.5 the corresponding results for width and shift are not shown in tables since the impact approximation breaks down , while for 0.1@xmath54__nv__@xmath560.5 befor the corresponding stark broadening parameters is an asterisk to notice that this result is on the limit of validity of impact approximation . in the cases",
    "when , for the given ( _ t _ and _",
    "n _ ) , the impact approximation is not valid , for the estimation of ion broadening is convenient quasistatic approach @xcite .",
    "if neither impact nor quasistatic approximation are valid , one can use a unified - type theory , as for example the approach of @xcite providing a simple analytical formula , convenient to use for such a case .",

    "one can see that stark broadening dominates in the large part of the considered atmosphere .",
    "new stark broadening parameters for 157 multiplets of b iv have been calculated within the frame of the semi - classical perturbation formalism .",
    "the results for stark broadening parameters of boron lines could be applicable for the adequate interpretation of the observed spectra in astrophysics , astrochemistry , and cosmology , in technological plasma research , for thermonuclear reaction devices , and for laser produced plasma investigation .",
