    "+ + + + + + + + +    the evidence for a debris disk around hd  88638 is only tentative , expressed as a single 2.4-sigma excess at 10.3@xmath0 .",

    "iso_. longer - wavelength , sensitive ir and sub - millimeter observations ( e.g. , with _ sirtf _ ) are needed to confirm the existence of a disk around this star .",
    "at the age of hd  88638 ( @xmath10600  myr , table  [ tab_phot ] ) , a debris disk of the inferred mass and distance from the star ( table  [ tab_disks ] ) would bear the closest resemblance to the main asteroid belt in our solar system among all other known stars with debris disks .    in fitting the excess in the sed of hd  88638 , we observe the same trend as discussed in the case of hd  17925 ( section  [ sec_diskparams ] ) . because the temperature of the blackbody required to fit the excess is not well - constrained , the disk luminosity fraction @xmath7 and the required dust mass @xmath8 are not correlated , and are temperature - dependent .      with the exception of hd  147809 , all the stars in our sample that lack an excesses are of spectral type g0 and later .",
    "the derived upper limits for @xmath7 ( assuming 300  k debris disks ) indicate @xmath200 , assuming that the dust particles behave like greybodies . for comparison ,",
    "the minimum dust mass detectable around a g0 dwarf in the _ iso _ 25@xmath0 survey of @xcite is estimated at @xmath201 , assuming a 120  k disk .",
    "our survey appears overall slightly less sensitive than theirs , possibly because of our slightly larger median errorbars : @xmath202  mag in @xmath63 for our ground - based observations vs.@xmath203  mag in @xmath204 $ ] for the _ iso _ observations of @xcite .",
    "however , if we apply the method of dust mass estimation of @xcite , we obtain that our @xmath2 band observations should be sensitive to disk masses @xmath205 around g0 stars , i.e.  our sensitivity is comparable to theirs in terms of the minimum amount of detectable dust mass .",
    "regardless , from the standpoint of searching for debris disks of different temperatures ( and thus , radii ) , the two surveys are complementary .",
    "the results of two large studies targeting disk evolution around main - sequence stars with _ iso _ and _ iras _ data have shown that the amount of circumstellar dust , and the number of stars possessing detectable ir dust excesses , are both decreasing functions of stellar age ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite )",
    ". given our very limited sample , and a bias in the source selection toward stars with known dust disks we can not test the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite we do , however , reproduce the tendency of decreasing dust fraction @xmath7 with age among stars with detected ir excesses ( figure  [ fig_agefdmd ] ; upper panel ) , with a power law index of @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) , compared with 1.76 derived in @xcite .",
    "aa  tau and hd  88638 have been excluded from the fit , the dust disk of aa  tau being optically thick ( and hence not relevant to the discussion of debris disk evolution ) , and the excess in hd  88638 being uncertain . because we are biased towards detecting only the most luminous debris disks , our estimates of @xmath7 delineate only an upper envelope to the actual amount of ir excess present in any object in the 1  myr  ",
    "1  gyr age range .    as discussed in section  [ sec_diskparams ] above",
    ", the amount of ir excess @xmath7 is not in a one - to - one correspondence with the mass of emitting circumstellar dust @xmath8 , but is also a function of the dust temperature , or equivalently , of the distance @xmath134 of the dust from the star ( equation  3 ) .",
    "hotter dust produces larger values of @xmath7 by virtue of a larger area under the planckian curve , for a fixed dust mass and mean particle size .",
    "it would therefore be a coincidence if the @xmath7-age and @xmath8-age relations followed the same functional form .",
    "this would require that circumstellar dust is maintained at the same temperature around each star , whereas we have examples from our own solar system ( zodiacal dust vs.  asteroid belt vs.  kuiper belt ) , and from other vega - like systems ( e.g. , @xmath208  lep vs.  @xmath38  lyr vs.  @xmath199  eri ) that dust temperatures range from @xmath209  k. one could therefore expect a tighter correlation in the @xmath210 vs.  the @xmath211 relation , given that the former is a more physical relationship .",
    "a plot of @xmath8 as a function of stellar age is presented in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig_agefdmd ] .",
    "the fitted slope is @xmath212 ( excluding aa  tau and hd  88638 ) , with a goodness of fit @xmath213 , similar to the one found for the @xmath7-age relation above .",
    "there is thus no evidence from our limited amount of data that @xmath8 is more tightly correlated with stellar age than @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8-age relation is however steeper than the one derived by @xcite , and marginally ( 1.7@xmath100 ) inconsistent with that expected for collisionally replenished secondary dusts disks ( power - law index near 2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the inclusion of the data point due to hd  88638 only strengthens this trend ( @xmath214 vs.  @xmath215 for the @xmath8-age vs.  @xmath7-age case ) , with the power - law indices remaining approximately unchanged ( @xmath216 and @xmath217 , respectively ) , though slightly more discrepant with each other ( at the 2.4@xmath100 level , vs.  1.5@xmath100 when hd  88638 is excluded ) .",
    "given that @xmath8 is a direct estimate of the dust disk mass , and the marginal inconsistency between the two power law indices , it appears that @xmath7 may be a less adequate tracer of the evolution of dust disks than our estimate of @xmath8 .",
    "the    @xmath218    relation is inferred by @xcite based on the purely geometric assumption that the collisional rate of large particles @xmath219 goes as @xmath220 , where @xmath2 is the number density of large planetesimals in the system . when the gravitational potentials @xmath221 of the planetesimals become comparable to the square of their random velocities @xmath222 , the collisional cross - sections of the planetesimals increases beyond their simple geometric cross - sections because of gravitational focusing .",
    "in the two - body approximation , the collision rate is given by ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) :    @xmath223    where @xmath224 is the gravitational cross - section .",
    "collisions between planetesimals become more likely with increasing particle size , and their rate goes as @xmath225 , instead of @xmath226 as in the geometrical regime .",
    "the resulting runaway and/or oligarchic growth @xcite should effectively increase the depletion rate of dust particles faster than @xmath227 ; i.e. ,    @xmath228    where @xmath229 .",
    "hence , the steeper power law index that we infer ( @xmath230 ) presents tentative evidence for planetesimal growth in debris disks .",
    "an important shortcoming of the above discussion is that we do not consider the stars for which we do not find evidence for orbiting debris disks .",
    "as noted , due to an inherent bias toward stars with known debris disks in our sample , we can not perform an analysis similar to the ones in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is significant however , that a number of our sources do not show any ir excess , when they would be expected to possess such , given universal application of the inferred @xmath231 relation .",
    "the apparent scatter in disk mass vs.  age may depend on the history of each system , and in particular , on whether favorable conditions for disk retainment had been present throughout the evolution of the star . for instance",
    ", the youngest star in our sample , di  tau , shows no excess emission at 10@xmath0 , a rather atypical state for an m star @xmath232  myr old . di  tau is however a binary system with a @xmath233  au projected separation , and @xcite argue that the formation of the companion has led to the rapid evolution of the circumstellar disk that may have surrounded di  tau . on the other hand , hd  145519 @xcite and hd  109573a also reside in binary systems , though exhibit ir excesses . the separation between the components , or conditions other than binarity may be important for the disk dissipation time scale .",
    "the spectral type of the star may play a role @xcite , with hotter stars eroding their disks faster , as a result of higher radiation pressures , and shorter poynting - robertson time scales .",
    "in addition , the presence or absence of orbiting planets may also affect disk - clearing @xcite .",
    "a larger , unbiased sample , including a range of stellar spectral types , as well as single and multiple systems would be needed to address the issues raised here .",
    "more accurate dust mass estimates from disk models , employing realistic grains , would be needed to verify the validity of our suggestion that @xmath8 ( as calculated from equation  3 ) is a steeper function of stellar age than @xmath7 , and potentially a more adequate tracer of the evolution of debris disks .",
    "using ground - based 10@xmath0 observations we have demonstrated sensitivity to the stellar photosphere of nearby solar - type stars , and hence to small excess ( @xmath234 for a 300  k debris disk ) above it .",
    "our mid - ir data confirm previous space- and ground - based observations for a subset of our targets , and give new insight into this regime for the remainder , by complementing the existing data . by employing simple fitting of the observed ir excesses with blackbody curves , we extract reliable estimates of the ratio @xmath7 of the dust luminosity to the stellar bolometric luminosity .",
    "we calculate lower limits on the amount of dust present in each system , after accounting for the effects of radiation pressure and poynting - robertson drag .",
    "our analysis of the excess in the hd  17925 system points to the fact that it may be the star with the smallest amount of circumstellar dust detected among vega - like systems to date .",
    "we present strong evidence for the existence of a previously undetected debris disk around hd  107146 , and possibly one around hd  88638 .",
    "our detection of an excess in hd  107146 from archival _ iras _ fsc data suggests that there may be more stars with unknown debris disks in the deeper and higher signal - to - noise fsc , than what is currently known from analyses of the psc . a methodical search for these in combination with 2mass near - ir photometry ,",
    "as already presented in @xcite for the psc , but watchful of the caveats addressed here and the ones described in @xcite , could therefore prove fruitful . given that very few disks are found around late - type stars due to their intrinsic faintness , the results of such a search could significantly increase the number of known debris disks around solar- and later - type stars .",
    "ground - based 10@xmath0 and 20@xmath0 follow - up observations will be indispensable in discerning _",
    "iras / iso _ false positives from bona - fide mid - ir excesses , as well as potentially successful in finding new excess candidates ( e.g. , as in the case of hd  88638 ) .    based on our limited data",
    ", we discuss the possibility of breaking the degeneracy between debris disk temperature and mass in the @xmath7 vs.stellar age relation .",
    "we find that the power law index in the inferred dust mass @xmath8-age relation is steeper than in the @xmath7-age case , and hence tentatively propose the use of @xmath8-age relation as a better tracer of the evolution of the amount of debris around main - sequence stars .",
    "however , a deficiency of the proposed power - law is that it does not take into account the absence of debris disk around stars which would be expected to harbor such based on their age .",
    "we argue that other factors , such as stellar multiplicity and spectral type , may also play a role .",
    "future space - based ir observations with _",
    "sirtf _ and _ sofia _ are expected to greatly expand the number of known vega - like stars , by being sensitive to debris disks as faint as the zodiacal dust ( @xmath235 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) around nearby stars as evolved as our sun",
    ". these will provide the database necessary to answer the prominent questions about the processes and time - scales of evolution of debris disks around main - sequence stars , and will place our own solar system in the context of stellar and planetary evolution .",

    "<S> a 10@xmath0 excess is detected only in hd  109573a ( hr  4796a ) , confirming prior observations ; among the m dwarfs , excesses are confirmed in aa  tau , cd  40@xmath18434 , and hen  3600a . a previously suggested @xmath2 band excess in the m3 dwarf cd  33@xmath17795 is shown to be consistent with photospheric emission .    </S>",
