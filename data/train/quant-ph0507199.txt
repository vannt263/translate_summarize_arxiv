    "description of the electron s motion on a lattice has been investigated for a long time as a central problem of the condensed matter physics .",
    "such quantum problem is reduced to the solving of the schrdinger equation with some model potential which is periodic often .",
    "therefore , the periodic quantum mechanics problems remain at the investigation s focus up to now .",
    "the general properties of the solutions of schrdinger equation with periodic potential energy are described by the oscillation theorem @xcite .",
    "energy spectrum of the periodic potential has band structure , i.e. eigenvalues belong to the allowed bands ( energy bands ) @xmath0,[e_1^{'},e_2], ... $ ] .",
    "the wave functions are the bloch functions , which are bounded and extended on the full real axe @xmath1 where @xmath2 is potential period and @xmath3 is a so - called quasi - momentum .",
    "the limits of the energy bands are given by the equation @xmath4 , and the wave functions , which belong to the limiting energy values , satisfy the condition @xmath5 .",
    "these energy values and wave functions are often called the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the described above problem .",
    "oscillation theorem claims that in the case of periodic potentials the eigenfunctions , which belong to the limits of the energy bands and are arranged in the energy of the increasing order @xmath6 , are the periodic functions with the period @xmath7 and have @xmath8 nodes in the interval @xmath2 respectively .    despite long term investigations",
    ", there is rather a limited number of exactly solvable periodic potentials even in one dimension .",
    "the classical examples are the kronig - penney model potential @xcite or lam s potentials @xcite .    because of limited number of the exactly solvable potentials ,",
    "recently much attention has been given to the quasi exactly solvable ( qes ) potentials for which a finite number of the energy levels and the corresponding wave functions are known explicitly .",
    "a general treatment of the quasi exact solvability has been introduced by turbiner and ushveridze @xcite .",
    "the class of qes trigonometric potentials was presented in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the lam equation is a peculiar example of qes systems .",
    "the authors of the paper @xcite considered a family of spectral equation which extends those of @xcite .",
    "authors of @xcite has applied quantum hamilton - jacobi formalism to the qes periodic potentials . in the latest paper @xcite an unified treatment of quasi exactly solvable potentials",
    "was proposed .    the powerful tool for studying the problem of exact solvability of the schrdinger equation is the supersymmetric ( susy ) quantum mechanic introduced by witten @xcite ( for a review of susy quantum mechanics see @xcite ) .",
    "the susy method for constructing qes potentials was used for the first time in @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the idea of this method starts from some initial qes potential with @xmath9 known eigenstates and using the properties of the unbroken supersymmetry to obtain the susy partner potential , which is a new qes one with @xmath10 know eigenstates .    in @xcite-@xcite using the formalism of susy quantum mechanics a large number of new solvable and qes periodic potential was proposed .",
    "it is worth mentioning recent paper @xcite , where the highest order susy transformations was applied for studying periodic potential .    in recent tkachuk s papers @xcite-@xcite",
    "a new susy method for constructing of the qes potentials with two and three known eigenstates has been proposed .",
    "this method does not require knowledge of the initial qes potential in order to generate a new qes one",
    ". within the frame of this method qes potentials has been obtained for which the explicit form of the energy levels and the wave functions of the ground and the excited states can be found .",
    "after the paper @xcite by dolya and zaslavskii , where they showed how to generate qes potentials with arbitrary two known eigenstates without resorting to the susy quantum mechanics , susy method has been extended @xcite for constructing qes potentials with arbitrary two known eigenstates . in our recent works using the susy method periodic @xcite and disordered @xcite qes potentials were obtained .    in the present paper using the results of previous study @xcite-@xcite we extend tkachuk s susy method for constructing qes periodic potentials with three known eigenstates .",
