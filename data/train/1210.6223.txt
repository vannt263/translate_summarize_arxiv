    "<S> nuclear electric resonance ( ner ) is based on nuclear magnetic resonance mediated by spatial oscillations of electron spin domains excited by a radio frequency ( rf ) electric field , and it allows us to investigate the spatial distribution of the nuclear spin polarization around domain walls ( dws ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , ner measurements were made of the dynamic nuclear spin polarization ( dnp ) at the spin phase transition of the fractional quantum hall state at a landau level filling factor of @xmath0 . from the rf pulse power and pulse duration dependence of the ner spectrum , we show that the dnp occurs only within @xmath1 nm around dws , and that it does not occur in dws . we also show that dws are pinned by the hyperfine field from polarized nuclear spins . </S>"
