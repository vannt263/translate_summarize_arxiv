    "wave propagation around non trivial solutions of einstein equations , black hole in particular , is an active field of research ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the perspective of gravitational waves detection in a near future and the great development of numerical general relativity have increased even more the activity on this field .",
    "gravitational waves should be especially strong when emitted by black holes .",
    "the study of the propagation of perturbations around them is , hence , essential to provide templates for the gravitational waves identification . in the other hand ,",
    "recent astrophysical observations indicate that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion phase , suggesting the existence of a small positive cosmological constant and that de sitter ( ds ) geometry provides a good description of very large scales of the universe @xcite .",
    "we notice also that string theory has recently motivated many works on asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    in this work ,",
    "we perform an exhaustive investigation of scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations in the background of a schwarzchild - de sitter spacetime .",
    "we scan the full range of the cosmological constant , from the asymptotic flat case ( @xmath1 ) up to the critical value of @xmath2 which characterizes the nariai solution @xcite .",
    "two different numerical methods and a higher order wkb analysis are used .",
    "we remind that for any perturbation in the spacetimes we consider , after the initial transient phase there are two main contributions to the resulting asymptotic wave @xcite : initially the so called quasinormal modes , which are suppressed at later time by the tails .",
    "the first can be understood as candidates to normal modes which , however , decay ( their energy eigenvalues becomes complex ) , as in the ingenious mechanism first described by g. gamow in the context of nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "after the initial transient phase , the properties of resulting wave are more related to background spacetime rather than to the source itself .",
    "it is well known that for asymptotic flat backgrounds the tails decay according to a power - law , whereas in a space with a positive cosmological constant the decay is exponential .",
    "curiously , @xmath0 modes for scalar fields in ds spacetimes , contrasting to the asymptotic flat cases , approach exponentially a non vanishing asymptotic value @xcite .",
    "we detected , by using a non - characteristic numerical integration scheme , a dependence of this asymptotic value on the initial velocities .",
    "in particular , it vanishes for static initial conditions .",
    "the semi - analytical analyses of this work were performed by using the higher order wkb method proposed by schutz and will @xcite , and improved by iyer and will @xcite .",
    "it provides a very accurate and systematic way to study black hole quasinormal modes .",
    "we apply it to the study of various perturbation fields in the non - asymptotically flat ds geometry .",
    "quasinormal modes are also calculated according to this approximation , and the results are compared to the numerical ones whenever appropriate , providing a quite complete picture of the question of quasinormal perturbations for ds black holes .",
    "two very recent works overlap our analysis presented here .",
    "a similar wkb analysis @xcite was done very recently by zhidenko @xcite , and his results coincide with ours .",
    "yoshida and futamase @xcite used a continued fraction numerical code to calculate quasinormal mode frequencies , with special emphasis to high order modes .",
    "our results are also compatible .",
    "finally , we notice that solutions of the wave equation in a non trivial background has also been used to infer intrinsic properties of the spacetime @xcite .",
    "the metric describing a spherically black hole in the presence of a cosmological constant is well known in the literature . written in spherical coordinates , the schwarzschild - de sitter metric",
    "is given by @xmath3 where the function @xmath4 is @xmath5 the integration constant @xmath6 is the black hole mass , and if the cosmological constant is positive , the spacetime is asymptotically de sitter . in this case , @xmath2 is usually written in terms of a `` cosmological radius '' @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "assuming @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the function @xmath4 has two positive zeros @xmath11 and @xmath12 and a negative zero @xmath13 .",
    "this is the schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) geometry , in which we are interested .",
    "the horizons @xmath11 and @xmath12 are denoted event and cosmological horizons respectively . in this case , the constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 are related with the roots by @xmath14 @xmath15 if @xmath16 , the zeros @xmath11 and @xmath12 degenerate in a double root .",
    "this is the extreme sds black hole . if @xmath17 , there is no real positive zeros , and the metric ( [ metric ] ) does not describe a black hole",
    ".    we will consider scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations in the submanifold given by @xmath18 in this region , we define the `` tortoise '' radial coordinate by @xmath19 with @xmath20 the constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the surface gravity associated with the event and cosmological horizons .",
    "for a scalar field @xmath23 obeying the massless klein - gordon equation @xmath24 the usual separation of variables in terms of a radial field and a spherical harmonic @xmath25 , @xmath26 leads to schrdinger - type equations in the tortoise coordinate for each value of @xmath27 , @xmath28 where the effective potential @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 \\ .\\ ] ]    in the schwarzschild - de sitter geometry , in contrast to the the case of a electrically charged black hole , it is possible to have pure electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations .",

    "after the integration is completed , the values @xmath57 and @xmath58 are extracted , where @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is the maximum value of @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) on the numerical grid .",
    "taking sufficiently large @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we have good approximations for the wave function at the event and cosmological horizons .",
    "it is not difficult to set up a numeric algorithm to solve equation ( [ wave_equation ] ) with cauchy data specified on a @xmath63 constant surface .",

    "their behavior is described in general by three phases .",
    "the first corresponds to the quasinormal modes generated from the presence of the black hole itself .",
    "a little later there is a region of power - law decay , which continues indefinitely in an asymptotic flat space . in the presence of a positive cosmological constant",
    ", however , an exponential decay takes over in the latest period .",
    "some qualitatively different effects show up when we turn away from the near extreme limit . for a small cosmological constant the asymptotic behavior",
    "is dominated by an exponential decaying mode rather than by a quasinormal mode .",
    "such exponential decays will characterize the de sitter space in general .",
    "we will later comment about the pure de sitter limit , which is exactly solvable , though we do not have definite answers about the respective behavior .",
    "the exponential decay also characterizes the electromagnetic as well as the gravitational perturbations .",
    "as the separation of the horizons increases , the quasinormal frequencies deviate from the predicted by expressions ( [ w - qext - sc ] ) and ( [ w - qext - gr ] ) . in figure [ w - kappap ] , this is illustrated for @xmath109 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the values obtained for the fundamental modes using the numerical and semi - analytic methods .",
    "we find that the agreement between then is good , for the hole range of @xmath2 .",
    "the difference is better for the first values of @xmath27 .",
    "this is expected , since the numerical calculations are better in this region . in the table",
    "[ sc - num - wkb ] , we illustrate these observations with a few values of @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to mention that quasinormal frequencies for the sds black hole were already calculated in a recent paper @xcite , applying a variation of the wkb method used here @xcite .",

    "the behavior of the modes is illustrated in figure [ multi - n ] .",
    "the behavior of the electromagnetic field is similar .",
    "a @xmath101 analysis of the data presented in figure [ exp - dec ] shows that the massless scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations in sds geometry behave as @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 for @xmath63 sufficiently large . at the event and the cosmological horizons @xmath63",

    "the numerical simulations developed in the present work reveal an interesting transition between oscillatory modes and exponentially decaying modes . as shown in figure [ kexp - wi ] , as the cosmological constant decreases , the absolute value of @xmath115 decreases .    above a certain critical value of @xmath2 we do not observe the exponential tail ,",
    "since the coefficient @xmath116 is larger than @xmath117 thus the decaying quasinormal mode dominates . but",
    "for @xmath2 smaller than this critical value , @xmath117 turns out to be larger than @xmath116 and the exponential tail dominates . certainly , for a small enough cosmological constant the exponential tail dominates in the various cases considered here .",
    "another aspect worth mentioning in the intermediate region is the dependence of the parameters @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 with @xmath27 and @xmath22 .",
    "the results suggest that the @xmath116 are at least second differentiable functions of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , close to @xmath122 , we approximate @xmath123 @xmath124 previous results are illustrated in figure [ kexp - kappac ] .",
    "scalar fields in the sds geometry near the asymptotically flat limit wore studied in @xcite . in this case",
    "there is a clear separation between the event and the cosmological horizons , such that @xmath125    a new qualitative change occurs in this regime , namely a decaying phase with a power - law behavior .",
    "such a phase occurs between the quasinormal mode decay and the exponential decay phases .",
    "the field can not be simply described by a superposition of the various modes , which would imply a domination of the power - law phase .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ appr - s ] .",
    "we have identified three regimes , according to the value of @xmath2 for the decay of the scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations . near the extreme limit ( high @xmath2 ) , we have analytic expressions for the effective potentials and to the quasinormal frequencies .",
    "the decay is entirely dominated by the quasinormal modes , that is , oscillatory decaying characterized by a non vanishing real part of the quasinormal frequency .    in an intermediary parameter region ( lower @xmath2 ) , the wave functions have an important qualitative change , with the appearance of an exponential tail .",
    "this tail dominates the decay for large time . near the asymptotically flat limit ( @xmath126 ) , we see an intermediary phase between the quasinormal modes and the exponential tail  a region of power - law decay . when @xmath1 , this region entirely dominates the late time behavior",
    ".    finally , for scalar fields with @xmath39 a constant decay mode appears , and its value depends on the @xmath77 initial condition . figure [ non - char ] reveals the appearance of the constant value @xmath103 for large @xmath63 , and its dependence on @xmath77 .",
    "the value of @xmath103 falls below @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "an immediate extension of the work developed in this paper is the in treatment of field propagation in the exterior of charged and asymptotically de sitter black holes . in this case , the electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations are necessarily coupled",
    ". it would be interesting to see if the general picture presented here is still valid in this more general context .",
