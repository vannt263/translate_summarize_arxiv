    "our objective in this paper is to study the following :    [ quest ] let @xmath7 be a projective family of surfaces of degree @xmath8 in @xmath9 , with @xmath10 a smooth threefold , and @xmath11 the complex unit disc ( usually called a _ degeneration _ of the general @xmath12 , for @xmath13 , which is a smooth surface , to the _ central fibre _ @xmath14 , which is in general supposed to be singular ) .",
    "what are the limits of tangent , bitangent , and tritangent planes to @xmath6 , for @xmath13 , as @xmath15 tends to @xmath3 ?",
    "similar questions make sense also for degenerations of plane curves , and we refer to @xcite for a glimpse on this subject . for surfaces , our contribution is based on foundational investigations by caporaso and harris @xcite , and independently by ran @xcite , which were both aimed at the study of the so - called _ severi varieties _ ,",
    "i.e. the families of irreducible plane nodal curves of a given degree .",
    "we have the same kind of motivation for our study ; the link with question [ quest ] resides in the fact that nodal plane sections of a surface @xmath6 in @xmath9 are cut out by those planes that are tangent to @xmath6 .",
    "ultimately , our interest resides in the study of severi varieties of nodal curves on @xmath1 surfaces .",
    "the first interesting instance of this is the one of plane sections of smooth quartics in @xmath9 , the latter being primitive @xmath1 surfaces of genus @xmath16 .",
    "for this reason , we concentrate here on the case @xmath17 .",
    "we consider a couple of interesting degenerations of such surfaces to quite singular degree 4 surfaces , and we answer question [ quest ] in these cases .",
    "the present paper is of an explorative nature , and hopefully shows , in a way we believe to be useful and instructive , how to apply some general techniques for answering some specific questions . on the way",
    ", a few related problems will be raised , which we feel can be attacked with the same techniques . some of them we solve ( see below ) , and the other ones we plan to make the object of future research",
    ".    coming to the technical core of the paper , we start from the following key observation due to caporaso and harris , and ran ( see  [ s : zrr ] for a complete statement )",
    ". assume the central fibre @xmath14 is the transverse union of two smooth surfaces , intersecting along a smooth curve @xmath18 .",
    "then the limiting plane of a family of tangent planes to the general fibre @xmath6 , for @xmath13 , is :    [ i : node ] either a plane that is tangent to @xmath14 at a smooth point , or    [ i : tangency ] a tangent plane to @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , the limit has to be counted with multiplicity 2 in case .",
    "obviously , this is not enough to deal directly with all possible degenerations of surfaces .",
    "typically , one overcomes this by applying a series of base changes and blow  ups to @xmath0 , thus producing a semistable model @xmath19 of the initial family , such that it is possible to provide a complete answer to question [ quest ] for @xmath0 by applying a suitable extended version of the above observation to @xmath20 .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is _ well behaved _ when it is possible to do so , and",
    "@xmath20 is then said to be a _ good model _ of @xmath0 .",
    "we give in ",
    "[ s : zrr ] a rather restrictive criterion to ensure that a given semistable model is a good model , which nevertheless provides the inspiration for constructing a good model for a given family .",
    "we conjecture that there are suitable assumptions , under which a family is well behaved .",
    "we do not seek such a general statement here , but rather prove various incarnations of this principle , thus providing a complete answer to question [ quest ] for the degenerations we consider .",
    "specifically , we obtain :    [ t : tetrahedron ] let @xmath7 be a family of general quartic surfaces in @xmath21 degenerating to a _ tetrahedron _",
    "@xmath14 , i.e. the union of four independent planes .",
    "the singularities of @xmath10 consist in four ordinary double points on each _ edge _ of @xmath14 .",
    "the limits in @xmath22 of @xmath5-tangent planes to @xmath6 , for @xmath13 , are : +    the @xmath23 webs of planes passing through a singular point of @xmath10 , plus the @xmath24 webs of planes passing through a _ vertex _ of @xmath14 , the latter counted with multiplicity @xmath16 ; +    the @xmath25 pencils of planes passing through two double points of the total space @xmath10 that do not belong to an edge of @xmath14 , plus the @xmath26 pencils of planes passing through a vertex of @xmath14 and a double point of @xmath10 that do not belong to a common edge of @xmath14 ( with multiplicity @xmath16 ) , plus the @xmath27 pencils of planes containing an edge of @xmath14 ( with multiplicity @xmath28 ) ; +    the @xmath29 planes containing three double points of @xmath10 but no edge of @xmath14 , plus the @xmath30 planes containing a vertex of @xmath14 and two double points of @xmath10 , but no edge of @xmath14 ( with multiplicity @xmath16 ) , plus the @xmath23 planes containing an edge of @xmath14 and a double point of @xmath10 not on this edge ( with multiplicity @xmath28 ) , plus the @xmath24 _ faces _ of @xmath14 ( with multiplicity @xmath31 ) .",
    "[ t : kummer ] let @xmath7 be a family of general quartic surfaces degenerating to a general _",
    "kummer surface _ @xmath14 .",
    "the limits in @xmath22 of @xmath5-tangent planes to @xmath6 , for @xmath13 , are : +    the dual surface @xmath32 to the kummer ( which is itself a kummer surface ) , plus the @xmath28 webs of planes containing a node of @xmath14 ( with multiplicity @xmath33 ) ; +    the @xmath34 pencils of planes containing two nodes of @xmath14 , each counted with multiplicity @xmath24 ; +    the @xmath28 planes tangent to @xmath14 along a _ contact conic _ ( with multiplicity @xmath35 ) , plus the @xmath25 planes containing exactly three nodes of @xmath14 ( with multiplicity @xmath36 ) .",
    "we could also answer question [ quest ] for degenerations to a general union of two smooth quadrics , as well as to a general union of a smooth cubic and a plane ; once the much more involved degeneration to a tetrahedron is understood , this is an exercise .",
    "we do not dwell on this here , and we encourage the interested reader to treat these cases on his own , and to look for the relations between these various degenerations .",
    "however , a mention to the degeneration to a _",
    "double quadric _ is needed , and we treat this in  [ sec : pair of quadrics ] .",
    "apparent in the statements of theorems [ t : tetrahedron ] and [ t : kummer ] is the strong enumerative flavour of question [ quest ] , and actually we need information of this kind ( see proposition [ p : deg - dual ] ) to prove that the two families under consideration are well behaved .",
    "still , we hope to find a direct proof in the future .    as a matter of fact , caporaso and",
    "harris main goal in @xcite is the computation of the degrees of severi varieties of irreducible nodal plane curves of a given degree , which they achieve by providing a recursive formula . applying the same strategy ,",
    "we are able to derive the following statement ( see  [ s : triangle ] ) :    [ t : triangle ] let @xmath37 be three independent lines in the projective plane , and consider a degree @xmath38 divisor @xmath39 cut out on @xmath40 by a general quartic curve . the sub  linear system @xmath41 of @xmath42 parametrizing curves containing @xmath39 has dimension @xmath16 .    for @xmath43 , we let @xmath44 be the zariski closure in @xmath41 of the locally closed subset parametrizing irreducible @xmath5-nodal curves .",
    "then @xmath44 has codimension @xmath5 in @xmath45 , and degree @xmath46 for @xmath47 , degree @xmath48 for @xmath49 , degree @xmath31 for @xmath50 .",
    "remarkably , one first proves a weaker version of this ( in  [ s : triangle ] ) , which is required for the proof of theorem [ t : tetrahedron ] , given in  [ s:4planes ] .",
    "then , theorem [ t : triangle ] is a corollary of theorem [ t : tetrahedron ] .",
    "it has to be noted that theorems [ t : tetrahedron ] and [ t : kummer ] display a rather coarse picture of the situation .",
    "indeed , in describing the good models of the degenerations , we interpret all limits of nodal curves as elements of the limit @xmath51 of @xmath52 , for @xmath13 , inside the relative hilbert scheme of curves in @xmath10 .",
    "we call @xmath51 the _ limit linear system _ of @xmath52 , for @xmath13 ( see  [ s : resolving ] ) , which in general is no longer a @xmath21 , but rather a degeneration of it . while in @xmath22 , which is also a limit of @xmath52 , for @xmath13",
    ", there are in general elements which do not correspond to curves ( think of the plane section of the tetrahedron with one of its faces ) , all elements in @xmath51 do correspond to curves , and this is the right ambient to locate the limits of nodal curves .",
    "so , for instance , each face appearing with multiplicity @xmath31 in theorem [ t : tetrahedron ] is much better understood once interpreted as the contribution given by the @xmath31 curves in @xmath53 appearing in theorem [ t : triangle ] .",
    "it should also be stressed that the analysis of a semistable model of @xmath0 encodes information about several flat limits of the @xmath6 s in @xmath9 , as @xmath2 tends to @xmath3 ( each flat limit corresponds to an irreducible component of the limit linear system @xmath51 ) , and an answer to question [ quest ] for such a semistable model would provide answers for all these flat limits at the same time .",
    "thus , in studying question [ quest ] for degenerations of quartic surfaces to a tetrahedron , we study simultaneously degenerations to certain rational quartic surfaces , e.g. , to certain _ monoid _ quartic surfaces that are projective models of the faces of the tetrahedron , and to sums of a _ self  dual _ cubic surface plus a suitable plane . for degenerations to a kummer , we see simultaneously degenerations to double quadratic cones , to sums of a smooth quadric and a double plane ( the latter corresponding to the projection of the kummer from one of its nodes ) , etc .",
    "though we apply the general theory ( introduced in  [ s : gnl - rules ] ) to the specific case of degenerations of singular plane sections of general quartics , it is clear that , with some more work , the same ideas can be applied to attack similar problems for different situations , e.g. , degenerations of singular plane sections of general surfaces of degree @xmath54 , or even singular higher degree sections of ( general or not ) surfaces of higher degree . for example , we obtain theorem [ t : triangle ] thinking of the curves in @xmath41 as cut out by quartic surfaces on a plane embedded in @xmath9 , and letting this plane degenerate . by the way , this is the first of a series of results regarding no longer triangles , but general configurations of lines , which can be proved , we think , by using the ideas in this paper . on the other hand , for general primitive @xmath1 surfaces of any genus @xmath55 , there is a whole series of known enumerative results @xcite , yet leaving some open space for further questions , which also can be attacked in the same way .",
    "another application of our analysis of question [ quest ] is to the irreducibility of families of singular curves on a given surface .",
    "this was indeed ran s main motivation in @xcite , since he applied these ideas to give an alternative proof to harris one @xcite of the irreducibility of severi varieties of plane curves .",
    "the analogous question for the family of irreducible @xmath5nodal curves in @xmath56 , for @xmath10 a general primitive @xmath1 surface of genus @xmath57 is widely open .",
    "in @xcite one proves that for any non negative @xmath58 , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the _",
    "universal severi variety _",
    "@xmath61 , parametrizing @xmath5nodal members of @xmath62 , with @xmath10 varying in the moduli space @xmath63 of primitive @xmath1 surfaces of genus @xmath64 in @xmath65 , is irreducible for @xmath66 .",
    "one may conjecture that all universal severi varieties @xmath61 are irreducible ( see @xcite ) , and we believe it is possible to obtain further results in this direction using the general techniques presented in this paper . for instance , the irreducibility of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , which is well known and easy to prove ( see proposition [ prop : irr ] ) , could also be deduced with the degeneration arguments developed here .",
    "note the obvious surjective morphism @xmath69 . for @xmath70 general",
    ", one can consider @xmath71 the _ severi variety _ of @xmath5nodal curves in @xmath56 ( i.e. the fibre of @xmath72 over @xmath70 ) , which has dimension @xmath73 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that the irreducibility of @xmath74 does not imply the one of the severi varieties @xmath75 for a general @xmath76 ; by the way , this is certainly not true for @xmath77 , since @xmath78 has dimension 0 and degree bigger than 1 , see @xcite .",
    "of course , @xmath79 is isomorphic to the _ dual variety _ @xmath80 , hence it is irreducible . generally speaking ,",
    "the smaller @xmath5 is with respect to @xmath64 , the easier it is to prove the irreducibility of @xmath81 : partial results along this line can be found in @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) . to the other extreme",
    ", the curve @xmath82 is not known to be irreducible for @xmath76 general . in the simplest case @xmath83 , this amounts to proving the irreducibility of @xmath84 for a general quartic @xmath10 in @xmath21 , which is the nodal locus of @xmath85 .",
    "this has been commonly accepted as a known fact , but we have not been able to find any proof of this in the current literature .",
    "we give one with our methods ( see theorem [ thm : v2 ] ) .    finally , in ",
    "[ ssec : monod ] , we give some information about the monodromy group of the finite covering @xmath86 , by showing that it contains some _ geometrically interesting _ sugbroups .",
    "note that a remarkable open question is whether the monodromy group of @xmath87 is the full symmetric group for all @xmath55 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ s : gnl - rules ] , we set up the machinery : we give general definitions , introduce limit linear systems , state our refined versions of caporaso and harris and ran s results , introduce limit severi varieties . in ",
    "[ s : enumerate ] , we state some known results for proper reference , mostly about the degrees of the singular loci of the dual to a projective variety . in   [ s:4planes ] and [ s : kummer - degen ] , we give a complete description of limit severi varieties relative to general degenerations of quartic surfaces to tetrahedra and kummer surfaces respectively ; theorems [ t : tetrahedron ] and [ t : kummer ] are proved in ",
    "[ s : tetra - concl ] and  [ s : kummer - concl ] respectively . in ",
    "[ sec : pair of quadrics ] we briefly treat other degenerations of quartics . section [ s : kummer - descr ] contains some classical material concerning kummer quartic surfaces , as well as a few results on the monodromy action on their nodes ( probably known to the experts but for which we could not find any proper reference ) : they are required for our proof of theorem [ thm : v2 ] and of the results in  [ ssec : monod ] .",
    "section [ s : triangle ] contains the proof of a preliminary version of theorem [ t : triangle ] ; it is useful for  [ s:4planes ] , and required for  [ s : irreducibility ] .",
