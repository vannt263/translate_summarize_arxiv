    "the hadronic decays of @xmath0 mesons have provided us with a good place to study cp violation in particle physics . in particular",
    ", the detection of direct cp violation in a decay process requires that there exist at least two contributing amplitudes with different weak and strong phases .",
    "the direct cp - violating effect in the @xmath0 system has finally been observed in the @xmath6 decay at the @xmath0-factories @xcite , proving the existence of nontrivial strong phases in @xmath0 decays .",
    "it is therefore of consequence to find out the patterns of final - state strong phases for a wider set of decay modes .    since the ckm factors involved in charmed @xmath0 meson decays are purely real to a good approximation , the phases associated with the decay amplitudes thus have the origin of strong interactions .",
    "such final - state rescattering effects have been noticed from data in these decays @xcite , and estimated to be at 15 - 20% level @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no satisfactory first - principle calculations can yield such strong phases @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we performed an analysis based upon the experimental data available at that time .",
    "a few theoretical and experimental questions are left unanswered .",
    "as more decay modes have been observed and others are measured at higher precisions , it becomes possible for us to look at and answer those questions . in this paper ,",
    "flavor su(3 ) symmetry is employed to relate different amplitudes and strong phases of the same topological type .",
    "moreover , we will take a different approach by fitting theoretical parameters to all available branching ratios simultaneously .",
    "an advantage of this analysis is that the parameters thus obtained are insensitive to statistical fluctuations of individual modes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : decomp ] , we give the amplitude decomposition of modes under flavor su(3 ) symmetry and the current branching ratio data .",
    "theoretical parameters involved in our analysis are defined . in section  [ sec : phases ] , we consider three sets of charmed decay modes : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote charmless pseudoscalar and vector mesons , respectively .",
    "a summary of our findings is given in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in the decomposition of decay amplitudes , relevant meson wave functions are assumed to have the following quark contents , with phases chosen so that isospin multiplets contain no relative signs :    * _ beauty mesons : _",

    "tree amplitude @xmath35 : _ this is associated with the transition @xmath36 ( cabibbo - favored ) or @xmath37 ( cabibbo - suppressed ) in which the light ( color - singlet ) quark - antiquark pair is incorporated into one meson , while the charmed quark combines with the spectator antiquark to form the other meson .",
    "_ color - suppressed amplitude @xmath38 : _ the transition is the same as in the tree amplitudes , namely @xmath39 or @xmath37 , except that the charmed quark and the @xmath40 combine into one meson while the @xmath41 or @xmath42 quark and the spectator antiquark combine into the other meson .",
    "_ exchange amplitude @xmath43 : _ the @xmath44 quark and spectator antiquark exchange a @xmath45 boson to become a @xmath46 pair , which then hadronizes into two mesons by picking up a light quark - antiquark pair out of the vacuum .",
    "after factoring out the ckm factors explicitly , we obtain the flavor amplitude decomposition of the charmed @xmath0 decay modes in tables  [ tab : dp ] , [ tab : dstp ] , and [ tab : dv ] . in these tables , we introduce positive @xmath47 s to parameterize the flavor su(3 ) breaking effects .",
    "this symmetry is respected between strangeness - conserving and strangeness - changing amplitudes when @xmath47 s are taken to be unity .",
    "as we will discuss in the next section , @xmath47 s will be allowed to change in order to test the assumption . using the wolfenstein parameters @xcite , the relevant ckm factors are : @xmath48 none of which contain a weak phase to the order we are concerned with . in the following analysis , we take the central values @xmath49 and @xmath50 quoted by the ckmfitter group @xcite .",
    "since only the relative strong phases are physically measurable , we fix the tree ( @xmath35 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 ) amplitudes to be real and pointing in the positive direction .",
    "we then associate the color - suppressed and exchange amplitudes with the corresponding strong phases explicitly as follows : @xmath53    the magnitude of invariant decay amplitude @xmath54 for a decay process @xmath55 is related to its partial width via the following relation : @xmath56 with @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the masses of @xmath59 , respectively . to relate partial widths to branching ratios",

    "this is the reason why the global @xmath78 fits in the @xmath2 sector are not as satisfactory as those in the @xmath7 and @xmath79 sectors .    in ref .",
