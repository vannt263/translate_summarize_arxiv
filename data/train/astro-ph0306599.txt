    "the development of supermassive black hole accretion theories has always been limited by observations ( pringle 1981 ) .",
    "this has been changing quickly during the past few years , with increasingly higher resolution observations being made over a wide frequency range .",
    "for example , the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( _ chandra _ ) and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) both have sub - arcsec scale resolutions , while the _ very large baseline interferometer _ ( _ vlbi _ ) can resolve structures on sub - milliarcsec scale . by combining multiwavelength observations from these different instruments ,",
    "we can obtain very strict constraints on the nature of accretion around supermassive black holes .    while the innermost structures of agns remain unresolved ( however , cf .",
    "melia & falcke 2001 regarding the galactic center ) , the current data are good enough to constrain the properties of the large - scale accretion disks that are presumably feeding the central engines . a better understanding of these large - scale disks is not only tenable , but will also provide significant implications on the nature of the agns .",
    "most of the relevant theoretical work to date is based on the standard @xmath4-disk prescription ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , in which the accretion disk at large radii is supported by the thermal pressure of the gas ( see , e.g. , hubeny 1990 ; hur et al .",
    "1994 ; collin & hur 1999 )",
    ". this may not be the entire story , however , as some observations suggest that turbulence is prominent in the disks of many radio galaxies ( ferrarese , ford & jaffe 1996 ; ferrarese & ford 1999 ; van langevelde et al .",
    "in addition , the inner disk is irradiated ( maloney , hollenbach & tielens 1996 ) , which should affect , e.g. , its physical properties and line emission characteristics .    at a distance of only @xmath5  mpc ,",
    "the fr  i radio galaxy ngc  4261 provides us an exceptional opportunity to investigate these new effects . harboring a @xmath6 black hole at its center ( ferrarese et al .",
    "1996 ) , ngc  4261 is well known for its kiloparsec - scale jets ( birkinshaw & davies  1985 ) and its hundred parsec - scale dusty disk imaged by _ hst _ ( jaffe et al .",
    "this disk possesses an atomic surface density of @xmath7 @xmath8 , as inferred from its optical depth assuming a galactic dust / gas ratio . on a smaller scale ,",
    "a thin circumnuclear disk of radius @xmath9  pc was revealed by radio line absorption studies ( jaffe & mcnamara 1994 ; van langevelde et al .",
    "this portion of the disk has an column density of @xmath10  @xmath8 , where @xmath11 k is the spin temperature of the gas . at an even smaller scale , free - free absorption of radio emission from the core by a geometrically - thin disk of radius @xmath12  pc",
    "was detected ( jones et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 , 2001 ; piner , jones & wehrle 2001 ) .",
    "this recent finding adds significant content to the accretion picture because this radius corresponds to only @xmath13 , where the schwarzschild radius @xmath14  cm for the central black hole in ngc  4261 .",
    "although these observations of the accretion disk extend to sub - parsec scales , a fully self - consistent accretion model does not yet exist , particularly for the small free - free absorbing disk ( sudou et al .",
    "jones et al .  ( 2000 ) did have success in attributing the observed free - free absorption to a standard @xmath4-disk .",
    "unfortunately , to match the observations , the model requires a dissipative stress that is much greater than that provided by subsonic turbulence . a viable alternative for ( or addition to ) this stress must be found in order for the model to be fully self - consistent .",
    "we suggest here that supersonic turbulence is the responsible agent",
    ". observations of ngc  4261 provide direct evidence that turbulence is prominent in the disk from @xmath15  pc to about @xmath16  pc , with the inner boundary set by observational limitations . at 100  pc ,",
    "the width of narrow lines from the disk suggest a turbulent velocity of @xmath17  km / s ( jaffe et al .",
    "1996 ) , while at 6  pc , the turbulent velocity estimated from the absorption profile is about @xmath18  km / s ( jaffe & mcnamara 1994 ; van langevelde et al .",
    "strong turbulence in the accretion disk is understandable given that the disk is embedded within the core of the galaxy , where it is subject to disruption by strong stellar winds .",
    "the dissipation of turbulence is regulated by the cascade in energy from large scales to small scales , so the total energy associated with the turbulent motion decays roughly as a power - law in time ( lazarian 2003 ) , even in the case of supersonic turbulence ( smith , mac low & zuev 2000a ) .",
    "this slow turbulence decay suggests that the supersonic structure might persist even to smaller radii .    in such a supersonic disk ,",
    "the accreting gas is optically - thin and gravitational energy dissipation will overwhelm line cooling at a critical radius @xmath1 , within which the gas is effectively heated to a temperature close to its virial value ( pringle 1981 ) .",
    "thermal pressure of the gas will then dominate the turbulent pressure at @xmath19 , so the supersonic flow appears to terminate at this radius and the gas may make a transition into an advection - dominated accretion flow thereafter ( narayan & yi 1994 ) . on larger scales , the supersonic structure can be inferred directly from observations .",
    "it is interesting to note that with a stress parameter @xmath20 , the value of @xmath1 is roughly @xmath21 pc , which corresponds to the inferred size of the free - free absorbing region .",
    "thus the observed shadowing of the nascent radio jet may be produced by the ionized gas near @xmath1 .",
    "we further note that newly released _",
    "chandra _ data also hint that the nucleus of ngc  4261 may be weakly - active ( peter , zezas & fabbiano 2001 ) , consistent with earlier _ asca _ and _ rosat _ observations ( matsumoto et al .  2001 ; worrall & birkinshaw 1994 ) . the corresponding ionization parameter at @xmath21  pc ( assuming that the radiation is isotropic ) is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the ionizing flux between 1 and @xmath25  ryd , and @xmath26 is the total number density including all species .",
    "note that @xmath27 roughly corresponds to the ionizing - photon - to - gas pressure ratio .",
    "a value of @xmath28 indicates that the gas may be effectively photoionized .",
    "this photoionization will significantly affect the profiles of the lines emitted by the supersonic disk . high - resolution _ hst _ imaging of the central ionized gas has detected broad emission lines from a region smaller than 7 pc in radius ( ferrarese et al .",
    "1996 ) . in this paper , we show that a supersonic disk , irradiated by the agn , can not only account for the observed radio absorption feature , but also reproduce these broad emission lines .",
    "we also show that its large - scale extension is consistent with the radio line absorption observations .",
    "the physical conditions present in the broad line regions ( blrs ) of this class of radio galaxy are likely to be very different than those present in the more - luminous seyfert galaxies and quasars . in both scenarios ,",
    "the line emission is produced by gas having temperature on the order of a few times @xmath2  k , with line broadening caused by bulk motions of the emitting plasma .",
    "however , while the blr in seyferts and quasars is primarily photoionized , our model predicts that heating due to gravitational dissipation plays a significant role in the low - luminosity radio galaxies .",
    "our modeling also indicates a very different blr geometry for these galaxies , with the line emission coming directly from the turbulent accretion disk .",
    "while accretion disks may play an important role in some blr models of seyferts and quasars , the line emission is not believed to originate in the disk itself , instead being associated with , e.g. , magnetohydrodynamic flux tubes ( emmering , blandford , and shlosman 1992 ) or radiation- and gas - pressure driven winds rising from the surface of the disk ( murray et al .",
    "the accretion disk does not even play a direct role in many successful blr models for these objects , e.g. , the bloated star ( alexander & netzer 1994 ) or accretion - shock cooling models ( fromerth & melia 2001 ) .",
    "it is also noted that the density of the blr gas in these galaxies is much lower than in traditional agns . because broad forbidden emission lines are absent in seyfert and quasar spectra , we know that the density of their line - emitting gas is @xmath29",
    "however , the spectra of some low - luminosity radio galaxies contain strong broad forbidden emission lines ( e.g. , [ ] , [ ] ) , indicating gas densities @xmath31  @xmath30 ( see , e.g. , ferrarese & ford 1999 ; barth et al .",
    "the lower density blr gas may be directly tied to their lower mass accretion rates and resulting luminosities .",
    "we first discuss the general properties of a supersonic disk in ",
    "[ sec : turbdom ] .",

    "detailed modeling of the line emission from this supersonic disk , irradiated by its agn , is given in ",
    "[ lineemission ] . in ",
    "[ discussion ] , we discuss the implication of this work on the nature of agns in radio galaxies .",
    "because it is thought that the large - scale dusty disk feeds the inner accretion of the agn ( jaffe et al .",
    "1996 ) , the detection of a prominent gap in the radio core of ngc  4261 prompted jones et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) to introduce a free - free absorbing disk to account for the observed features . to produce the radio absorption",
    ", the inner disk must have an emission measure of @xmath32  pc  @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the electron density , @xmath35 is the path length through the absorbing gas , and @xmath36 is the electron temperature in units of @xmath2  k. if dominated by thermal gas pressure , however , the optically thin @xmath4-disk proposed by these authors can not account for this radio shadowing in a self - consistent manner .",
    "in particular , we show below that the implied stress parameter @xmath4 is too large for the flow to be subsonic .    for a gas - pressure - dominated accretion disk",
    ", angular momentum conservation requires that @xmath37 at large radii , where @xmath38 is the kinetic viscosity , @xmath4 is the stress parameter ( assumed to be radius - independent and less than one ) , @xmath39 is the radial velocity of the flow , @xmath40 is the scale height of the disk , and @xmath41 is the local sound speed . from the expressions given in jones et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , one can obtain : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the keplerian velocity , @xmath44 is the black hole mass in units of @xmath45 , @xmath46 gives the accretion rate , and @xmath47 is the distance of the radio absorbing gas from the black hole in units of @xmath48 cm .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the disk can not be supported by thermal pressure of the gas alone since the corresponding accretion rate is : @xmath49 where quantities with subscript @xmath50 denote the corresponding values inferred from the radio absorption features , and we have approximated the line - of - sight path length through the disk with @xmath51 ( jones et al . 2001 ) , where @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the gas constant and @xmath54 is the molecular weight .",
    "such an accretion rate is so small that the implied emission efficiency for converting accreted rest - mass energy into x - ray emission from the nucleus of ngc  4261 is about @xmath55 ( worrall & birkinshaw 1994 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "2001 ) , which is unacceptable for any @xmath56 in a thermal pressure supported disk .",
    "sudou et al .",
    "( 2000 ) further discussed an optically - thick standard disk and an optically - thin disk cooled by free - free emission .",
    "neither of these alternatives can account for the observed shadowing .",
    "meanwhile , several observations indicate that turbulence dominates the gas motion at large scales ( jaffe et al .",
    "1996 ; van langevelde et al .",
    "2000 ) , where supersonic turbulence may be produced by stellar winds in the core of the galaxy ( jaffe et al .",
    "as the gas falls in toward the black hole , however , the strength of the residual turbulence in the disk is determined by balancing shock dissipation with the turbulence enhancement due to gravitational energy dissipation . in a fully developed turbulent flow , energy",
    "is mostly associated with large - scale gas motion . the decay rate of the total turbulent energy",
    "is then determined by the rate at which energy cascades from large scales to small scales . the turbulent energy density per unit mass , @xmath57 ,",
    "is therefore given by @xmath58 where the dot denotes a derivative with respective to time and @xmath59 gives the characteristic time scale for transporting energy from large to small scales .",
    "the characteristic length scale , @xmath60 , of the system depends on the turbulence generation mechanism .",
    "assuming @xmath60 is independent of time , we have @xmath61 . in their numerical simulations of the decay of supersonic turbulence , smith et al .",
    "( 2000a ) found that the total energy of the turbulence decays roughly with a power law in time , with an index @xmath62 .",
    "we point out that as the large - scale supersonic gas flows inward , the dissipative stress is provided primarily by its turbulent motion .",
    "so the dissipated gravitational energy will go first into producing turbulence .",
    "this turbulence generation mechanism can , in principle , keep the disk supersonic even on smaller scales ( smith , mac low & heitsch 2000b ) .",
    "a complete model addressing the evolution of this supersonic accretion flow , however , would require a detailed numerical simulation beyond the scope of this paper .    in the following discussion",
    ", we will assume that the energy associated with the turbulent motion is in sub - equipartition with , and proportional to , the gravitational energy of the gas .",
    "we therefore have @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a `` turbulence parameter '' , which can be fixed by the observed disk properties at large radii , and @xmath65 is the turbulent velocity in the flow .",
    "the supersonic disk model ( in which the stress is dominated by turbulence ) then gives : @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ numd ] ) , @xmath67 is the baryon number density averaged in the vertical direction of the accretion disk and @xmath68 is the proton mass . because the h i absorption feature indicates that @xmath69 at @xmath70  pc from the nucleus , we obtain @xmath71 .",
    "the corresponding disk opening angle is @xmath72 . then from equations ( [ height ] ) and ( [ numd ] ) , we have @xmath73 it is interesting to note that the viscous time scale in such a disk ( @xmath74 by definition ) is longer than the corresponding dynamical time scale ( @xmath75 ) by a factor of @xmath76 . adopting the power - law decay rate from the numerical simulations ( smith et al .",
    "2000a ) , one can show that the ratio of the turbulent energy to the dissipated gravitational energy is about @xmath77 .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath78 for @xmath4 less than one .",
    "one should emphasize that only a small fraction ( @xmath79 ) of the dissipated gravitational energy is left to drive the turbulent motion .",
    "most of the dissipated gravitational energy is thermalized via shocks and effectively radiated away . since we are mostly interested in regions where the gas is partially ionized , this cooling is dominated by line emission .",
    "we will see that there is a critical radius @xmath1 in the disk , where the gravitational energy dissipation rate equals the line cooling rate .",
    "the gravitational energy dissipation rate is given by @xmath80 from equation ( [ numd ] ) , we have @xmath81 using this equation to eliminate @xmath82 in equation ( [ heat ] ) , we get @xmath83\\ { \\rm ergs\\ cm^{-3}\\ s^{-1}}\\ .",

    "thus , for a stress parameter @xmath90 , equation ( [ critical ] ) shows that the critical point is located within the radio shadowing region .",
    "it is natural to expect that the observed radio absorption should be produced by the fully ionized gas near @xmath1 , and we will see below that ionizing photons from the central engine play a crucial role in determining the ionization state of the gas at this radius .",
    "_ hst _ observations indicate that the gas closest to the nucleus may be ionized by radiation from the central engine ( ferrarese et al .",
    "further evidence for this can be shown by estimating the ionization parameter at @xmath1 .",
    "recent high - resolution _ chandra _ observations have uncovered a high - energy source at the nucleus of ngc  4261 with a hard band x - ray luminosity of @xmath91  ergs / s ( peter et al .",
    "2001 ) , confirming earlier _ asca _ results ( matsumoto et al .",
    "2001 ) . meanwhile , the soft x - ray luminosity is @xmath92 ergs / s ( worrall & birkinshaw 1994 ) .",
    "so , assuming that the radiation is isotropic and that the gas temperature is @xmath93  k , we can estimate the value of the ionization parameter to be @xmath94 for the radio - absorbing gas at @xmath95  cm ( krolik 1999 ) .",
    "the radio - absorbing gas is therefore effectively photoionized .",
    "although the radiation pressure dominates the thermal pressure of the gas in the radio absorbing region , the turbulent pressure there is @xmath96  ergs  @xmath30 , which is much larger than the radiation pressure .",
    "so the disk structure , including the scale height and number density , is still determined by the turbulent motion . however , the gas temperature profile depends on the interaction between the disk and the radiation field .",
    "in the following sections , we will incorporate this photoionization effect using the algorithm cloudy ( ferland 1996 ; cloudy 96-@xmath973 ) and show that the observed broad - line spectrum may also be fitted with this disk model in a self - consistent fashion .",
    "to model line emission from the irradiated disk , we first need to know the intensity and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the ionizing radiation from the central source .",
    "these are highly uncertain due to a combination of factors .",
    "first , there are uncertainties associated with intrinsic absorption and galactic contamination which limit the precision to which we can quantify the spectrum in the optical and x - ray bands .",
    "second , the spatial distribution of photons is unknown  it is unclear whether the central engine emits isotropically ; the disk at @xmath1 may `` see '' a different spectrum from what we observe .",
    "third , and most importantly , we do not have observations ( or even good estimates ) of the continuum at uv energies .",
    "generally , the shape and intensity of the uv continuum most strongly determine the properties of a photoionized gas .",
    "the correlations between radio and optical spectra have suggested a non - thermal nuclear source for fr i radio galaxies ( chiaberge , capetti & celotti 1999 ) .",
    "further evidence for a power - law nuclear source in ngc  4261 comes from _ rosat _ and _ asca _ observations in the x - ray band ( worrall & birkinshaw 1994 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "2001 ) , which are confirmed by recent high spatial resolution _",
    "chandra _ observations ( rinn & sambruna 2001 ; peter et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the following discussion",
    ", we will adopt a power - law spectrum in the uv - range to bridge the gap between the optical and x - ray data .",
    "the continuum is assumed to be emitted isotropically from a central , point - like source , and the intensity of the ionizing luminosity remains a free parameter in our model to reflect our uncertainties .",
    "we are mostly interested in the region at @xmath12 pc .",
    "however , to determine the spectrum of the incident radiation , we also need to know the gas distribution in the inner region since radiation from the core may be reprocessed by intermediate gases .",
    "fortunately , according to the supersonic disk model , the disk will be heated up very quickly within @xmath1 , which makes the gas there optically - thin to uv and x - ray emission",
    ". one can show this by solving the energy conservation equation in the transition region between @xmath1 and the radius @xmath98 , where the thermal pressure of the gas equals the turbulent pressure and the supersonic accretion flow effectively terminates .    for a supersonic accretion disk , we have the energy conservation equation : @xmath99 \\ = \\",

    ", the termination radius @xmath98 is determined by solving the equation @xmath114 so @xmath64 must be smaller than 3/8 to make the thermal pressure of the gas dominate at small radii . a larger value of @xmath64 will cause the turbulent advection to cancel most of the gravitational energy dissipation and keep the disk supersonic .",
    "in addition , a more accurate expression for @xmath85 in the transition zone will make the gas heated even faster because it is on the unstable portion of the cooling curve ( liu , fromerth & melia 2002 ) . within @xmath98 ,",
    "the accretion pattern may transfer into an advection dominated flow ( narayan & yi 1994 ) .    within @xmath1 ,",

    ", we will need to use the algorithm cloudy with additional heating introduced by gravitational dissipation to calculate the temperature and the ionization state of the gas everywhere in the disk .    before calculating the line emission from the supersonic disk numerically , it may be illustrative to estimate the physical conditions of the broad - line region",

    "the model nicely reproduces the broad wings and steep core of the h@xmath4 + [ ] composite .",
    "there is an apparent excess in the modeled [ ] emission , which may be remedied by reducing the assumed abundance of sulfur in the model ( we used solar abundances throughout ) .",
    "allowing for this additional free parameter is beyond the scope of this paper , however , as we are more interested in showing a consistency in the line profiles rather than their relative strengths .",
    "figure  [ fig : temp_ion ] shows the radial dependence of the gas temperature and the ionization fraction of hydrogen in the best fit model . from this",
    "we see that most of the hydrogen is ionized near @xmath163 pc from the center .",
    "so significant free - free absorption is expected in the region .",
    "thermal equilibrium occurs when the heating and cooling rates balance ; stable equilibria occur only where the slope of the cooling function is positive ( e.g. , shore 1992 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : heat_cool ] illustrates the heating and cooling functions for the gas at radii @xmath164  cm ( top ) and @xmath165  cm ( bottom ) .",
    "the heating rate includes both gravitational dissipation and radiative effects , and the cooling rate must be determined including the dependency on the ionization state of the gas .",
    "cloudy calculates both of these rates in a self - consistent manner . at @xmath164  cm ,",
    "it is clear that only one stable solution exists , @xmath166  k ( compare with fig .",
    "[ fig : temp_ion ] ) , so there is no ambiguity in determining the equilibrium temperature . at large radii , however , it is apparent that two valid physical solutions exist . because our picture has the gas being heated from a low temperature as it accretes , we assign the smaller value in all such cases of uncertainty .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : temp_ion ] , the gas temperature jumps from @xmath167  k to @xmath93  k near @xmath168  cm when the gas moves from the lower temperature stable branch to the higher temperature one .",
    "this is interesting because neutral atomic hydrogen is concentrated at that radius and this may therefore explain the detected neutral hydrogen radio line absorption .",
    "we have shown that our model can reproduce the observed broad - line spectrum ; we now turn to the question concerning the observed absorption features .",
    "the free - free absorption optical depth at frequency @xmath169 is given by ( walker et al .",
    "2000 ) : @xmath170 \\ , \\ ] ] where all the quantities are given in cgs units .",
    "the line - center  @xmath171  cm optical depth , corrected for stimulated emission , is given by ( @xcite ) : @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the neutral hydrogen column depth and @xmath174 is the doppler line width ( including both turbulent and thermal broadening ) .",
    "note that for @xmath133 , the turbulent velocity of the gas is always much greater than the thermal velocity .",
    "figure  [ fig : opt_depth ] shows the radial dependence of both of these optical depths for our best - fit model , under the assumption that the line of sight is perpendicular to the disk .",
    "the free - free absorption is strong enough to account for the observed radio shadowing .",
    "however , the neutral hydrogen absorption seems deficient .",
    "this is not surprising given that we have neglected the density contrast of the supersonic disk in the calculation .",
    "observations of other radio galaxies have revealed that the gas is clumpy at the same spatial scale ( e.g. , harms et al .",
    "1994 ; haschick , baan & peng 1994 ; kartje , knigal & elitzur 1999 ) .",
    "introducing density contrast will not only change the temperature profile of the gas , but also increase the neutral hydrogen column density .",
    "so we would expect significant enhancement of radio line absorption in a detailed modeling that incorporates these additional effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : vary_l ] illustrates how the ionizing flux modifies the line spectrum . with an increase in @xmath132 , the heating and ionization parameters of the gas increase as well .",
    "this has the effect of moving the emission zone to larger radii , particularly for the low ionization [ ] and [ ] species . as a result ,",
    "the line profiles become narrower for increasing @xmath132 .",
    "a reduction of @xmath132 from the best fit value does not have such a drastic impact , however .",
    "this is because the inner radius reaches an asymptotic limit in the low luminosity case , determined solely by balancing the gravitational heating and line cooling rates via equation  ( [ critical ] ) . in this limit",
    ", the additional heating due to the radiation field is negligible .",
    "it is interesting to note that our best fit lies on the transition to this limit .",
    "the dependence of the line shape on the stress parameter @xmath4 is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : vary_a ] .",
    "a larger @xmath4 increases the accretion rate ( for a fixed number density at @xmath120 ) , causing additional heating in the gas ( via eq .",
    "[ eq : addheat ] ) .",
    "this moves the emission zone to larger radii , resulting in narrower line profiles .",
    "decreasing @xmath4 has the opposite effect .",
    "we have used the observed radio free - free absorption to fix our value of @xmath175 in the best fit model .",
    "figure  [ fig : vary_n ] illustrates the effect of varying @xmath175 .",
    "the density of the gas is important in many aspects , including a determination of the ionization parameter , as well as the gravitational heating and line cooling rates .",
    "it also has a strong impact on the fluxes of the [ sii ] and [ nii ] forbidden lines , which are suppressed relative to h@xmath4 for densities greater than the critical density , at which the radiative and collisional transition rates balance .    because the line emission broadening is due mainly to the keplerian motion of the gas , the line width is proportional to @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the keplerian velocity in the disk .",
    "the projection effect , characterized by the inclination angle @xmath135 , is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : vary_i ] .",
    "as expected , model spectra associated with small inclination angles have very narrow line profiles . note , however , that even when @xmath178 the lines have non - zero width .",
    "this is the effect of broadening due to the turbulent velocity @xmath179 .",
    "finally , the turbulent parameter @xmath64 has a similar effect on the accretion rate as the stress parameter @xmath4 .",
    "however , by increasing @xmath64 , we not only shift the broad emission line region toward large radii , but also increase the total line flux , as the disk becomes thicker ( thereby increasing the size of the emission region ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : vary_f ] shows how the line spectrum changes with @xmath64 .",
    "the accretion flow within @xmath98 is not well constrained .",
    "the fact that the inferred accretion rate from this supersonic disk model gives a radiative efficiency of @xmath180 suggests that advection may dominate in the inner region ( narayan & yi , 1994 ) .",
    "however , if we associate the observed x - ray emission with such an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) at small radii , we find that the observed x - ray spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath181 ( rinn & sambruna 2001 ; matsumoto et al 2001 ) is somewhat softer than that of the model prediction ( narayan et al .",
    "an adaf with strong winds may be able to produce a softer x - ray spectrum to account for the high energy emission from the agn in ngc  4261 ( quataert & narayan 1999 ) . and this outflow may be associated with the jet formation process in the core .",
    "it is also interesting to note that ngc  6251 is quite similar to ngc  4261 in that both of them have a hundred - pc scale dusty disk , large scale symmetric radio jets and an inverted radio spectrum at the core ( melia , liu & fatuzzo 2002 ) .",
    "compared with ngc 4261 , ngc  6251 is about 3 times further away from us , its x - ray luminosity is @xmath5 times stronger , and its broad h@xmath4 line flux is about 100 times bigger .",
    "hst observations suggest that there is a supermassive black hole of @xmath182 , which is very close to the black hole mass in ngc  4261 .",
    "if a similar accretion flow exists in ngc  6251 , equation ( [ line ] ) suggests that the electron number density must increase by a factor of @xmath183 to produce the strong h@xmath4 emission . combining this with the fact that the disk has an inclination angle of @xmath184 ( ferrarese & ford 1999 ) and that the agn is more active",
    ", we would expect that the observed broad emission line may also be fitted with our model .",
    "we also would expect strong radio line absorption in the direction of the counterjet with an h  i column density of @xmath185 @xmath8 .    in an earlier paper we introduced a hot expanding gas model for the multi - wavelength spectrum of the agn in ngc  6251 ( melia et al .",
    "according to that picture , a standard @xmath4-disk with an accretion rate of @xmath186 g  s@xmath103 exists near the black hole .",
    "how such a fossil disk can form after the supersonic disk terminates is still an open question .",
    "however , the implied strong evaporation of the accretion flow below @xmath98 suggests another origin for the hot unbound gas proposed in that model .",
    "further investigation is clearly warranted , and an application of the supersonic disk model to other radio galaxies may also prove to be invaluable in developing a unified theory for supermassive black hole accretion .",
    "this research was partially supported by nasa under grants nag5 - 8239 and nag5 - 9205 , and has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service .",
