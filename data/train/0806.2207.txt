    "the ability of noise to induce spatial ordering has received a special attention in last two decades .",
    "it is well known that in many situations noise can actually play a constructive role , to name just a few one can consider : noise - induced transitions in zero - dimensional systems @xcite , noise induced phase transitions in extended systems @xcite , patterns formation @xcite , coupled brownian motors @xcite , etc .",
    "most of the noise - induced effects are caused by an external fluctuations and attributed to a short time instability .",
    "in particular , noise - induced patterns and the phase transitions usually have a dynamical origin .",
    "it is principally important that in the case of the internal noise , obeying fluctuation - dissipation relation , a spatio - temporal coherence in nonlinear systems can not be observed in a short - time scale .",
    "such ordering processes follow an entropy - driven mechanism when a kinetic coefficient / mobility is a function of a stochastic field .",
    "it leads to the fact that a stationary distribution is described by a free energy functional reduced to a lyapunov functional for deterministic dynamics and by an entropy contribution related to the field - dependent mobility @xcite .",
    "it was shown by the most of works concerning such phenomena that quantitative change of the system behaviour is caused by the entropy variability .",
    "it was shown that internal fluctuations can sustain the spatial coherence ( patterns ) in nonlinear reaction - diffusion stochastic systems @xcite . in the simplest case",
    "such models have two essential features : the local dynamics and a transport phenomena .",
    "first of them is determined by the chemical reactions in the system and the second one relates to a diffusion of chemical species . introducing a fluctuating source into the model , we arrive at the stochastic description of non - equilibrium system behaviour with possible spatial order . in this work",
    "we consider a prototype model of the reaction - diffusion systems where an internal fluctuations are of a multiplicative character ( the noise intensity depends on a concentration field ) ( see ref.@xcite and citations therein ) . in the most of works devoting to study the system behaviour with a field - dependent mobility , the corresponding functional dependence is as follows : in the mixed state",
    "the kinetic coefficient is large , whereas in dense ones it has small values .",
    "a deterministic analysis of the systems with a generalized field - dependent mobility was performed in ref.@xcite , where the form of the kinetic coefficient was proposed by authors solely . in our consideration",
    "we use a generalized approach basing on a nonlinear master equation proposed by g.  kaniadakis @xcite and derive the generalized form for the kinetic coefficient . introducing the corresponding fickian diffusion term into the model and a term to describe a local dynamics of the field variables , we arrive at a deterministic model for the reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "considering a system in real conditions we take into account a fluctuation source related to an obtained mobility .    according to the well known approaches of entropy - driven phase transitions @xcite",
    "one can investigate a possibility of patterns formation and corresponding phase transitions .",
    "our goal in this article is to perform a detailed study of spatial system s coherent behaviour with a generalized kinetic coefficient in a bistable stochastic system .",
    "with help of variational principles we investigate a possibility of noise to sustain stationary spatial structures .",
    "a picture of noise - induced phase transitions will be studied with the mean - field approach and computer simulations .",
    "our paper is organized in the following manner . in the next section we present the general formalism to investigate the noise - induced phase transitions and patterns formation . in section 3",
    "we derive an expressions for the field - dependent diffusion coefficient using the formalism of nonlinear master equation and deformed boltzmann - gibbs statistics . according to the presented formalism",

    "we assume that following properties are satisfied : @xmath25 ; @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a maximal value .",

    "let us assume that the function @xmath23 has a power - law form .",
    "indeed , as it was shown before the complex systems can be described by the nonlinear continuity equation and are characterized by a power - law form for main statistical quantities ( see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "most of complex statistical systems are described by deformed boltzmann - gibbs statistics or q - statistics exploiting deformed logarithm s and exponential functions @xcite . by",

    "thus , inserting q - deformed logarithm into eq.([d_eff ] ) , one has @xmath34 in the most of works related to the nonlinear continuity equation ( [ nfpe0 ] ) the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are assumed to be linear versus its argument . in the simplest case one has : @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "it results to the construction of the form @xmath37 it is seen that the linear approximation of @xmath5 and @xmath6 does not give the bell - shaped form for the effective diffusion coefficient .",
    "evolution of the system with the effective diffusion coefficient ( [ d_simplest ] ) was described in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was shown that such complex systems manifest an anomalous diffusion .    to satisfy the main condition for",
    "the function @xmath23 let us assume nonlinear constructions for @xmath5 and @xmath6 . according to the fact that complex systems are self - similar ,",
    "let us write @xmath5 in the form @xmath38 where the exponent @xmath39 . to define the function @xmath6",
    "we suppose that the derivative @xmath40 in eq.([def_gk ] ) gives a power - low dependence , i.e. @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",

    "therefore , if @xmath104 decreases sharply at @xmath105 and @xmath106 , then the stationary distribution becomes unimodal at large values of the noise intensity @xmath18 .",
    "next let us investigate stationary structures @xmath87 .",

    "it is seen that the dependence @xmath111 has monotonically decreasing character . as it follows from our consideration",
    "the stationary periodic structures are formed in the vicinity of the point related to maximum of the function @xmath93 .    in the numerical studying of the noise - induced spatial patterns we integrate eq.([nfpe2 ] ) on a @xmath112-dimensional lattice of the mesh size @xmath113 . in the discrete space eq.([nfpe2 ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath114 where @xmath115 enumerates the element of the square lattice of @xmath116 cells ; periodic boundary conditions are used . the second term in eq.([langeven ] ) represents approximation of the gradient @xmath117 , where @xmath118 indicates nearest neighbors in the positive direction of each axis , whereas the third term is related to a discrete laplacian ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 denotes nearest neighbors of the site @xmath121 ) . to describe spatial patterns we use a spherical averaging of the structure function @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is a spherical shell of a radius @xmath124 .",

    "the last one gives an effective entropy @xmath133 multiplied by the noise intensity @xmath18 .",
    "in such a case we arrive at the standard thermodynamic definition of an internal energy @xmath134 .",
    "it is well known that in the theory of the entropy - driven phase transitions self - organization processes are not related to the short - time instability of the mixed / disordered state @xcite , its caused by entropy variations following from concentration - dependent mobility . in our case we have a quite similar situation . in particular , at early stages of the system evolution a noise destabilizes the disordered state @xmath28 , whereas at @xmath135 the entropy contribution plays a crucial role : it leads to patterning with small values of @xmath129 .",
    "obtained numerical results are in good corresponding with analytical predictions : in the stationary case the peak of @xmath131 moves toward small values of the wave vector when the noise intensity increases .",
    "in this section we will consider the noise - induced phase transitions with the above entropy mechanism . to this end",
    "we construct the weiss mean - field ( mf ) approximation , based on the stationary distribution function .",

    "the related susceptibility has the broad peak in the point corresponding to the system parameters values of the shaded domain shown in fig.[phs2d ] . to understand a principle change in the system behaviour one can estimate contributions of all nonlinearities appeared in the effective potential ( [ potencial ] ) .",
