    "<S> @xmath67@xcite we obtain the zero bias conductance after a contour integral ( all the subscript @xmath68 are omitted ) :    @xmath69       in the following , we use current formula ( 12 ) to study the zero bias conductance vs. the energy level of the qd , @xmath70 vs. @xmath71 numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the whole range of interaction of the leads , from noninteracting limit ( @xmath72 ) to strong interaction case ( @xmath73 ) , with much attention on the latter . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 presents the results for @xmath74 , @xmath75and @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the sideband peaks appears clearly for @xmath72 ; become blurring for @xmath77 merge into a single central peak for @xmath78 and finally become narrower for @xmath79 .    in order to study the quenching behavior , we chose @xmath7 equal to the smallest positive root of the zero order bessel function , @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> for the noninteracting limit case ( @xmath81 , the central peak is completely quenched as expected . </S>",
    "<S> however , with the increase of the interaction or the decrease of @xmath82 the situation changes significantly . for @xmath83 , </S>",
    "<S> the relative heights of the sideband peaks are almost unchanged , but the valleys lifted . </S>",
    "<S> both are shown in fig.2(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> most surprisingly , the quenching effect disappears completely for the strong interaction case ( shown in fig.2(b ) ) : a broader peak with a flat plateau for @xmath84 ; and a narrower single central peak for @xmath79 .    to further understand the pat in ll - qd - ll for strong interaction case </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate @xmath70 vs. @xmath85 for @xmath86 with different strengths and frequencies of the external fields , shown in fig.3 . </S>",
    "<S> one can clearly see that all sideband peaks disappear . and </S>",
    "<S> the width of the single central peak becomes broader with the increase of the strength or the frequency of the fields , originated from the contributions of the multi - photon - assisted tunneling processes .    </S>",
    "<S> all features mentioned above can be ascribed to the power - law behavior of the dos and the suppression of the electron tunneling near the fermi energies of ll leads . in order to understand the underlying physics , we label @xmath87 to indicate two pairs of processes : ( 1)the electron tunneling through the dot with @xmath88 photons absorbed in the left and @xmath6 photons emitted in the right lead , and its reversal process ; ( 2 ) same processes as in ( 1 ) except @xmath88 @xmath89 . as an analogy of the @xmath90 </S>",
    "<S> one can consider the tunneling currents under two different finite bias voltages @xmath91 and @xmath92 without the time - dependent fields . </S>",
    "<S> the difference of these two net currents is approximately equal to the net current of @xmath87 , except the effect due to difference of the width of the energy level in qd . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we shall discuss the pat qualitatively with the help of this analogy .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that for fl - qd - fl , the current under finite bias change abruptly at the fermi energies in the two leads due to the abrupt change of the electron occupations near fermi energies in the leads ; thus two sharp peaks at @xmath93 and @xmath94 obtained from the difference of the currents under two finite bias voltages , provided @xmath51 is small . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the conductance from @xmath95 has the same peaks at @xmath96 and @xmath97 conductance at other energies is strongly suppressed due to the uniform distribution of the electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> however , for ll - qd - ll , the dos of the leads behaves as @xmath98 as @xmath99 , the so - called power - law behavior of the dos , so @xmath100 for the weak interaction ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath102 @xmath103 as @xmath104 , thus there is also an abrupt change in the electron occupation near fermi energy ; two peaks at @xmath105 and @xmath106 still remain , but the valley between them is lifted due to the nonuniform of the dos . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions from all different @xmath87 processes give the total conductance with sideband peaks at @xmath107 and the valleys are lifted with the decrease of @xmath2 , consistent with the curves for @xmath108 in fig.1 and fig.2@xmath109    for the strong interaction case ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath110 @xmath111 as @xmath104 , thus no abrupt change in the electron occupation exists , and the difference of the currents under two finite bias voltages rises slowly at the outset and finally appears as a single peak centered at @xmath112 approximately , so that the @xmath87 processes do not contribute significantly at @xmath93 and @xmath94 , instead , a peak at @xmath113 @xmath112 is produced . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our calculation shows that processes such as @xmath114 , always producing a single peak at @xmath115 for any values of @xmath2 , are not important , due to the fact that the direct tunneling near fermi energy is strongly suppressed for strong interaction case . in fig.4 , we present the results from processes @xmath116 and @xmath117 showing a contribution almost 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the main processes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one can see from fig.4 that the main contributions to the conductance are originated from processes @xmath118 , with @xmath119 , especially from that of @xmath120 , which make significant contribution at @xmath121 but little at the sideband energies@xmath122 that is why for the strong interaction case only one single peak at @xmath121 exists , while all the sidebands are suppressed completely , as shown in fig.3 .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us explain why the quenching of the central peak disappears for strong interaction case . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the main contributions of the central peak come mainly from processes @xmath123 with @xmath124 for weak interaction ( @xmath125 but @xmath118 with @xmath126 for strong interaction case ( @xmath127 . given </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 the zeros of @xmath80 , all the processes like @xmath123 become zero and contribute nothing to the central peak for weak interaction case , but the processes in the strong interaction case are not affected much . </S>",
    "<S> thus the central peak is quenched as usual in the former , but will be lack in the latter @xmath128 . furthermore , since the conductance at @xmath129 come from many pat processes , it does not exist a single parameter @xmath7 by which all the processes , having main contributions to the central peak , can be neglected ; thus there is no quenching of the central peak in case of ll leads with @xmath3    formula ( 10 ) can also be applied to the case with asymmetric external fields . if only one lead is applied with an ac field , we find that the photon - electron pumping effect still occurs for ll case </S>",
    "<S> . however , the negative current becomes smaller and smaller with the decrease of @xmath2 and the maximum of the current shifts towards the negative @xmath42 ( not shown here ) .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the pat in the system of ll - qd - ll for the whole range of interaction of the ll leads and the crossover behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the zero bias conductance is strongly renormalized by the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for the strong interaction case ( @xmath1 ) , all sidebands merge into a single peak ( we called it submergence of the sidebands ) , and the quenching effect also disappears completely . </S>",
    "<S> these novel features of pat have been ascribed to the power - law behavior of the dos and the suppression of the electron tunneling near the fermi energies of ll leads . since </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments have confirmed that the carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) do have some properties of the ll,@xcite especially the power - law feature of the dos , we suggest a setup consisted of cnt - qd - cnt to study the pat of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we hope our theoretical predictions can be tested experimentally .    </S>",
