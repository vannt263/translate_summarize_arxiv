    "recent discoveries of photoinduced metallic phases in several mott insulators@xcite made us consider the strongly correlated electron physics from a new point of view .",
    "however , the optical properties of photoinduced carriers in mott insulators are not well understood even at low excitation densities .",
    "understanding these optical properties is a prerequisite to understanding the incipient creation of metallic phases .",
    "drude response by itinerant carriers is observed in the case of band semiconductors with low excited - carrier density ( 10@xmath2@xmath310@xmath4 @xmath5)@xcite .",
    "the comparison between the optical properties of photoinduced carriers at low excitation densities in mott insulators and those in band semiconductors would be important in gaining deeper insight into strongly correlated electron physics .",
    "the detailed nature of various carrier conductions , exhibiting drude or hopping conduction , can be well characterized in the terahertz ( thz ) regime@xcite .",
    "thz time - domain spectroscopy ( thz - tds ) is a powerful tool for analysing terahertz conductivity @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the remarkable advantage of thz - tds is its simultaneous determination of both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath6 , without using the kramers - kronig transformation@xcite .",
    "the coherent nature of the thz pulse is also utilized to investigate photoinduced @xmath6 by , for instance , optical - pump thz - probe ( optp ) studies .",
    "recent progress in thz technologies@xcite and the methodology of analysis@xcite in optp experiments enable evaluation of transient @xmath6 in many substances , such as semiconductors , high - t@xmath8 superconductors , liquids and organic materials@xcite .",
    "because the optp method essentially detects non - equilibrium processes , such as surface recombination and carrier diffusion , the time dependence of a complicated spatial carrier distribution must be considered@xcite .",
    "this difficulty is avoided by using thin - film samples@xcite where the optical pump pulse penetrates , and by analysing the photoinduced phase as a layer with a homogeneous @xmath6@xcite .",
    "furthermore the extraction of @xmath6 , varying quickly compared with the pulse width of thz probe pulse , only seems possible within some restricted conditions@xcite .",
    "therefore , to analyse photoinduced @xmath6 for a wide variety of mott insulators , free from the restrictions in sample preparation and analysis , we initially examined a nearly equilibrium state of photoexcited bulk material with a longer energy - relaxation time , @xmath9 .",
    "the photoexcitation of a material with longer @xmath9 creates a quasi - equilibrium state averaging over various non - equilibrium processes , making it easy to obtain the optical constants of the highest carrier - concentration region in the material .",
    "our analysis also required extracting @xmath6 of materials with inhomogeneous carrier distributions in a more rigorous manner .",
    "one good candidate for accomplishing this is the transfer - matrix method , which expresses inhomogeneous carrier distribution by a multi - layer system .",
    "this method has been briefly commented on in the literature@xcite .",
    "the promise that the transfer - matrix method can incorporate inhomogeneity is seen in the analyses of reflectivity in optical pump - probe studies@xcite .",
    "although it is a versatile method , its effectiveness has not been thoroughly discussed , especially in thz - tds studies .    in this study , we found that @xmath9 of a mott insulator ytio@xmath0 with mott gap of approximately 1 ev@xcite is 1.5 ms at 1.47 ev photoexcitation .",
    "we characterized the photoinduced @xmath6 by comparing it with that of a band semiconductor si with a bandgap of 1.1 ev@xcite .",
    "we also present a more detailed discussion of the transfer - matrix method .",
    "single - crystalline samples of ytio@xmath0 , with the orthorhombic perovskite gdfeo@xmath0-type structure , were grown by the floating zone method@xcite .",
    "the si sample was commercial high - resistivity si .",
    "photoconductivity was measured to assess @xmath9 .",
    "the light emitted from a multimode continuous wave ( cw ) laser diode ( ld ) with photon energy of 1.47 ev was modulated and used for illuminating the sample under an electric field of about 0.3 kv / cm .",
    "the photocurrent @xmath10 flowing through a 100 @xmath11 resistance , connected in series with the sample , was lock - in detected .",
    "optp experiment was performed by a transmission thz - tds system described in detail elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the thicknesses of platelet samples are 420 @xmath1 m for ytio@xmath0 and 512 @xmath1 m for si .",
    "the optical pulses were generated by a mode - locked ti - sapphire laser with a repetition rate of 76 mhz and central wavelength of 800 nm .",
    "both the thz emitter and detector were low - temperature grown gaas photoconductive antennas .",
    "si lenses were attached to the antennas to enhance the emission power and collection efficiency of thz pulses .",
    "the thz spectral range in this experiment was between 0.5 and 8 mev .",
    "the thz - wave - emission sides of the samples were photoexcited by the multi - mode cw ld with an incident angle of 45@xmath12 .",
    "the pump - beam power was 0.8 w for si and 1.2 w for ytio@xmath0 . for ytio@xmath0 ,",
    "the polarization of thz electric field @xmath13 is parallel to the _ b_-axis .",
    "the beam diameter of the ld light was about 8 mm and larger than that of the thz probe pulse , which is energy dependent ( e.g. 2 mm at 2 mev and 1 mm at 4 mev ) .",
    "the fluence rate was 1.6 w/@xmath14 for si and 2.4 w/@xmath14 for ytio@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the temperature rise resulting from the thermalisation by photoexcitation@xcite is estimated not to exceed 1 k.    optp measurements were also performed with the 1.55 ev optical - pump pulses split from the ti - sapphire laser to investigate the nature of conduction of carriers induced by light with photon energy larger than that of the cw ld .",
    "this experiment studied the anisotropy of photoinduced @xmath6 in ytio@xmath0 .",
    "the optical - pump pulse power was 230 mw .",
    "the optical - pump pulse beam diameter was about 2 mm ( fluence : 96 nj/@xmath14 ) - slightly smaller than that of the thz probe pulse below 2 mev .",
    "the @xmath13 was applied along either the @xmath15- or @xmath16-axis , maintaining the polarization of the optical - pump pulse electric field @xmath17 parallel to the @xmath15- or @xmath16-axis .",
    "all measurements were performed at room temperature .",
    "figure 1 shows the modulation - frequency dependence of @xmath10 .",
    "increasing the modulation frequency causes @xmath10 to decrease , according to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the proportional coefficient .",
    "the obtained @xmath19 and @xmath9 are listed in the figure . longer @xmath9 ( @xmath3 15 @xmath1s for si and @xmath3 1.5 ms for ytio@xmath0 )",
    "indicates that the samples are in quasi - equilibrium photoinduced state during the thz - tds measurements .",
    "@xmath9 of ytio@xmath0 is almost excitation - intensity independent ; this implies that a thermal effect does not dominate the relaxation process .",
    "although the direction of @xmath10 and of electric field of the cw ld pump are not identified accurately in ytio@xmath0 , a huge anisotropic @xmath9 that depends on the direction of @xmath10 and the polarization of the excitation light is not anticipated .",
    "the optp results shown later support this ( see fig .",
    "the temporal evolution of @xmath13 transmitted through si and ytio@xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) , respectively , with and without ld excitations ( 1.47 ev ) .",
    "photoexcitation attenuates both thz waves implying thz wave absorption is by the photoinduced carriers .",
    "thz energy dependence of transmission @xmath20 and phase shift @xmath21 are obtained by fourier transformation of thz waves , as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "they are calculated with the equations @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the fourier transformed amplitude and phase , with and without excitation , respectively .",
    "thz wave absorption by photoinduced carriers is responsible for @xmath20 decreasing below 1 for both samples , but the two exhibit different energy dependencies . as the thz energy increases , @xmath20 of si approaches 1 , while that of ytio@xmath0 gradually decreases .",
    "the opposite sign of @xmath21 of the two samples strongly indicates different fundamental conduction mechanisms of the photoinduced carriers .",
    "negative ( positive ) @xmath26 roughly means the refractive index is reduced ( increased ) , compared with an unexcited state , which influences the negative ( positive ) real part of the dielectric constant of photoinduced carriers . as explained below",
    ", these results indicate a metallic nature below a plasma frequency in si , and a localized nature , such as hopping carriers , in ytio@xmath0 .    before showing the photoinduced @xmath6 of si and ytio@xmath0",
    ", we mention the detailed procedure of the transfer - matrix method . a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of photoinduced carriers is initially regarded as exponentially decaying .",
    "subsequently a non - exponentially decaying distribution is introduced .",
    "the photoinduced phase with an exponentially decaying carrier distribution is divided into many thin slabs ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "each slab is supposed to have a uniform complex refractive index @xmath27 whose value is set to reproduce the exponential decay of the photoinduced carrier concentration .",
    "the transfer - matrix of each slab is described by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number index of the slab , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the incident thz wavelength in vacuum , and @xmath32 is the slab thickness@xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 of each slab is calculated from the complex dielectric constant @xmath33 using , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is @xmath33 without excitation , @xmath36 , the parameter to be optimized in this analysis , is @xmath33 resulting from carriers at the photoexcited surface of the sample , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is the depth from the photoexcited surface into the sample along the thz wave propagation , and @xmath39 is the optical penetration depth . for si ,",
    "frequency independent @xmath35@xcite of 11.7 is used . for ytio@xmath0 , @xmath35",
    "is experimentally determined by the thz - tds measurement and is weakly energy dependent ( e.g. 16.5 + 0.4@xmath40 at 2 mev and 17 + 0.4@xmath40 at 4 mev ) .",
    "@xmath39 of si at 1.47 ev is determined to be 8.4 @xmath1 m using the absorption coefficient from an optical data handbook@xcite .",
    "that of ytio@xmath0 at 1.47 ev was calculated to be 0.22 @xmath1 m from the reported reflectivity spectra@xcite ( 0.05 - 40 ev ) combined with the kramers - kronig transformation . then the total matrix @xmath41 is described as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total number of photoexcited slabs .",
    "finally , the thz complex transmission is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 mean the thz wave transmission with and without excitation , respectively , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the fitting of experimental @xmath20 and @xmath21 following the above mentioned procedure provides @xmath6 resulting from carriers at the photoexcited surface through @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the vacuum permittivity .",
    "note that the convergence of transmission is checked carefully by decreasing the thickness or by increasing the number of slabs .",
    "a thickness of the photoexcited phase ( @xmath51 , @xmath43=100 ) 5 to 10 times thicker than @xmath39 is typically employed .",
    "figure 5 shows photoinduced @xmath6 of si and ytio@xmath0 .",
    "@xmath6 of si can be interpreted by the drude model as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the carrier density , @xmath1 is the mobility , @xmath54 is the carrier collision rate and @xmath55 is the effective mass .",
    "the photoexcitation introduces both electrons and holes ; therefore , the tentatively assigned @xmath55 value is 0.26@xmath56 for electrons and 0.37@xmath56 for holes@xcite , where @xmath56 is the free - electron mass .",
    "hereafter , @xmath1 of each carrier is denoted as @xmath57 for electrons and @xmath58 for holes .",
    "we have considered the following two cases , neither of which can be excluded at the present stage .",
    "one is the two - carrier model of electrons and holes .",
    "the other takes only electrons into consideration , assuming that holes with heavy @xmath55 do not contribute to @xmath6 .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "5(a ) represent the calculated @xmath6 for the two - carrier model and the broken lines represent the electron - only model .",
    "the curves are in agreement with the experimental @xmath59 .",
    "this suggests that the itinerant carriers are certainly photogenerated in si . the obtained @xmath57 and @xmath58 are 2410 ( @xmath60210 ) @xmath14/vs and 500 ( @xmath6090 ) @xmath14/vs for the two - carrier model , and",
    "@xmath57 is 1820 ( @xmath60100 ) @xmath14/vs for the other model .",
    "they are roughly consistent with the literature values@xcite , but it is to be noted that @xmath57 in both models might be larger than the predicted ones",
    ". the ambiguity of @xmath55 may be responsible for this deviation .",
    "the most striking feature in @xmath6 of ytio@xmath0 is the negative @xmath61 .",
    "it suggests an existence of localized carriers@xcite , which is very different from si . the localization may arise from the on - site strong coulomb interaction between 3d electrons in ytio@xmath0 .",
    "to explain @xmath6 , we used the empirical jonscher law@xcite , which expresses @xmath6 of many materials with hopping carriers .",
    "the jonscher law is given by@xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the dc conductivity , @xmath64 the proportional coefficient and @xmath65 is restricted between 0 and 1 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) , the solid curves from the jonscher law seem to agree with experimental @xmath6 . in the solid curves , @xmath65 , @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "are 0.95 , 235 ( @xmath6010 ) @xmath66@xmath67 and 2.40 ( @xmath600.05)@xmath6810@xmath69 @xmath66@xmath67s@xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the allowed @xmath65 ranges from 0.91 to 0.99 , and corresponding @xmath63 and @xmath64 are 210 ( @xmath6010 ) @xmath66@xmath67 and 1.41 ( @xmath600.03)@xmath6810@xmath71 @xmath66@xmath67s@xmath72 , and 260 ( @xmath6010 ) @xmath66@xmath67 and 1.43 ( @xmath600.03)@xmath6810@xmath73 @xmath66@xmath67s@xmath74 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath6 can be also fitted by a two - component model , such as the drude - lorentz .",
    "the estimated photoinduced carrier number at the surface layer is about 0.015 per ti site .",
    "photoexcited ytio@xmath0 with the derived carrier density would be equivalent to chemically hole - doped y@xmath75ca@xmath76tio@xmath0 with @xmath77 much less than 0.1 given in ref .  36 .",
    "the @xmath78 spectrum of y@xmath75ca@xmath76tio@xmath0 in this composition region is very different than a drude response .",
    "therefore , it would be difficult to expect a drude component to exist .",
    "clarifying this point might require broadband spectroscopic information obtained under photoexcitation or the temperature dependence of @xmath6 .    since long relaxation times , @xmath9 ,",
    "are observed in both samples , a diffusion or a surface - recombination process , making the carrier distribution a non - exponential decay type , must be considered , and the analysis method modified .",
    "the carrier number @xmath79 along the thz wave propagation in a quasi - equilibrium state is obtained using a one - dimensional diffusion equation@xcite as follows : @xmath80 where @xmath81 depends on the time @xmath82 and the position @xmath83 along the thz wave propagation , and @xmath84 is the @xmath85-function .",

    "the carrier number in the quasi - equilibrium state requires the integration of @xmath81 with respect to @xmath82 , @xmath97 therefore , with the assumption of a conduction model and the knowledge of @xmath79 determined by appropriate @xmath98 and @xmath93 , @xmath99 can be calculated using eq .",

    "( [ equ : epsilon ] ) is replaced by @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are @xmath79 and @xmath33 of the highest carrier - concentration layer , respectively .",
    "after the determination of @xmath98 of si (= 346 @xmath14/vs ) using the literature values@xcite , @xmath93 is varied between 1@xmath6810@xmath103 cm / s and 1@xmath6810@xmath104 cm / s .",
    "representative @xmath79 normalized at @xmath101 are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "the @xmath101 is observed around 1@xmath32 @xmath1 m . assuming that both electrons and holes obeying the drude conductivity are responsible for @xmath6 , @xmath99 is confirmed as being consistent with experimental data for both @xmath79 ( see fig .",
    "the estimated @xmath53 is 5.2 ( @xmath600.3)@xmath6810@xmath4 @xmath5 and is comparable to that obtained by the previous model .",
    "this indicates that , at the highest carrier - concentration layer almost the same @xmath53 can be obtained , irrespective of the carrier distribution decay type . for ytio@xmath0 ,",
    "both @xmath93 and @xmath98 are unknown parameters .",
    "the wide range sweep of @xmath93 and @xmath98 gives various @xmath79 curves as depicted in the inset of fig .",

    ", the experimental @xmath99 is well reproduced by the jonscher law , where @xmath65 is restricted within the same range obtained in fig .",
    "5(b ) ( 0.91@xmath30.99 ) .",
    "typical examples are shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) with @xmath65 of 0.95 . the other parameters ( @xmath63 in @xmath66@xmath67 and @xmath64 in @xmath66@xmath67s@xmath70 ) for the dotted - solid , solid and broken lines are 125(@xmath6010 ) and 1.40(@xmath600.05)@xmath6810@xmath69 , 125(@xmath6010 ) and 1.2(@xmath600.1)@xmath6810@xmath69 , and 90(@xmath6010 ) and 1.0(@xmath600.1)@xmath6810@xmath69 , respectively . @xmath78 and @xmath105 calculated from the parameters are half to two - thirds of those in fig .",
    "thus , for ytio@xmath0 , the @xmath6 extracted from the model with exponentially - decaying carrier distribution roughly represents the highest carrier - concentration layer in the model using eq .",
    "( [ equ : new - epsilon ] ) .",
    "the photoinduced carrier number at the highest carrier - concentration layer in ytio@xmath0 is calculated as 0.015 per ti site@xcite .",
    "it can be proposed , therefore , that a phase with localized carriers would emerge initially at the photogeneration of the metallic phase in mott insulators .",
    "photoexcitation creates both electrons and holes , which differs from chemical doping , and a comparison of @xmath6 between photoexcited ytio@xmath0 and a hole - doped y@xmath75ca@xmath76tio@xmath0 is discussed .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath78 of photoexcited state might be much larger than that of corresponding y@xmath75ca@xmath76tio@xmath0 if the extrapolation of @xmath78 in y@xmath75ca@xmath76tio@xmath0 is carried out toward the thz energy .",
    "the preservation of spectral weight implies that the localization energy of photoinduced carriers would be much lower than for holes in y@xmath75ca@xmath76tio@xmath0 , even if both holes and electrons contribute to @xmath6 in photoexcited ytio@xmath0 .",
    "as it is not clear that the large difference in localization energy originates from only holes in such a low - carrier system , it is plausible that electrons with small localization energies also contribute to @xmath6 .",
    "therefore @xmath6 of photoexcited ytio@xmath0 would be supported by bound electrons as well as holes .    in a halogen - bridged ni one - dimensional chain compound [ ni(chxn)@xmath106br]br@xmath106 ( chxn = cyclohexanediamine ) , which is compared with ytio@xmath0 composed of a three - dimensional ti network , the localized @xmath107 is determined at a lower excitation density@xcite . despite being in a different energy region ,",
    "carrier localization in photoexcited mott insulators at low excitation densities may be the general phenomenon , irrespective of the dimensionality .",
    "the fact that one - dimensional mott insulators , such as [ ni(chxn)@xmath106br]br@xmath106@xcite and sr@xmath106cuo@xmath0@xcite , exhibit @xmath9 in the order of pico - seconds may suggest that dimensionality is a decisive factor of @xmath9 .",
    "figure 7 shows @xmath20 and @xmath21 obtained by optp experiments using a femtosecond - pulse laser ( 1.55 ev ) for ytio@xmath0 . since the period of optical - pump arrival time ( 13 ns ) is much shorter than @xmath9 , the photoinduced carriers are also in quasi - equilibrium state . in both polarizations of @xmath17",
    ", it is found that the degree of variation from the unexcited state in thz wave amplitude and phase is larger for @xmath108 within the measured thz energy range .",
    "this implies that the absolute values of @xmath107 and @xmath61 for @xmath108 are larger than those for @xmath109 .",
