    "at a fundamental level nature is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics , but until recently such phenomena were mostly a curiosity studied by physicists . however , significant advances in theory and technology are increasingly pushing quantum phenomena into the realm of engineering , as building blocks for novel technologies and applications from chemistry to computing .",
    "e.g. , advances in laser technology enable ever more sophisticated coherent control of atoms , molecules and other quantum systems .",
    "recent advances in nanofabrication have made it possible to create nanostructures such as quantum dots and quantum wells that behave like artificial atoms or molecules and exhibit complex quantum behaviour .",
    "cold - atom systems and the creation of bose condensates demonstrate that even macroscopic systems can exhibit quantum coherence .",
    "harnessing the potential of quantum systems is a challenging task , requiring exquisite control of quantum effects and system designs that are robust with regard to fabrication imperfection , environmental noise and loss of coherence .",
    "although significant progress has been made in designing effective controls , most control design is model - based , and available models for many systems do not fully capture their complexity .",
    "model parameters are often at best approximately known and may vary , in particular for engineered systems subject to fabrication tolerances .",
    "experimental system identification is therefore crucial for the success of quantum engineering .",
    "while there has been significant progress in quantum state identification and quantum process tomography , we require dynamic models if we wish to control a system s evolution . furthermore , effective protocols must take into account limitations on measurement and control resources for initial device characterization .",
    "this presents many challenges , from determing how much information can be obtained in a given setting to effective and efficient protocols to extract this information .",
    "here we illustrate some problems and solutions for the case of identifying the dynamics of a three - level system .",
    "one of the first questions to consider before attempting to find explicit protocols for experimental system identification is clearly what information we can hope to extract about a given system with a certain limited set of resources .",
    "for instance , given a system with a hilbert space of dimension @xmath0 , it is well known that the ability to prepare and measure the system in a set of computational basis states @xmath1 is insufficient for quantum process tomography , even if the process is unitary  @xcite .",
    "however , recent work shows that a substantial amount of information about the generators of the dynamics can be obtained for hamiltonian @xcite and even dissipative systems  @xcite at least generically , by mapping the evolution of the computational basis states stroboscopically over time .",
    "more precisely , this is done by determining the probabilities that a measurement of the observable @xmath2 produces the outcome @xmath3 after the system was initialized in the computational basis state @xmath4 and allowed to evolve for time @xmath5 for a number of different times @xmath6 .",
    "this begs the question how much information we can hope to obtain in general from such experiments . in this paper",
    "we consider hamiltonian systems , whose evolution is governed by the schrodinger equation @xmath7 with a fixed hamiltonian @xmath8 and @xmath9 , for which we have @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath11 be hermitian operators representing the hamiltonian and the measurement , respectively , and let @xmath12 be a positive operator with @xmath13 representing the initial state of the system .",
    "if @xmath11 , @xmath8 and @xmath12 are simultaneously blockdiagonalizable , i.e. , there exists a decomposition of the hilbert space @xmath14 such that @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are operators on the hilbert spaces @xmath19 , then we can at most identify @xmath8 up to @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the identity on the subspace @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath8 is block - diagonal then any initial state @xmath12 starting in a subspace @xmath19 must remain in this subspace .",
    "thus , the dynamics on each subspace is independent , @xmath22 with @xmath23 . per hypothesis @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "are also blockdiagonal , so @xmath24 = \\sum_s \\tr[m_s u_s(t ) \\rho_s u_s(t)^\\dag]$ ] . if @xmath25 then @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "thus , @xmath28 $ ] @xmath29 $ ] @xmath30 $ ] shows that @xmath8 and @xmath31 are indistinguishable .",
    "thus , there are some limitations on the maximum amount of information we can obtain about the system by initializing and measuring the system in a fixed computational basis . in particular , if @xmath8 and @xmath11 commute , we can infer that @xmath8 and @xmath11 are simultaneously diagonalizable , and assuming the eigenvalues @xmath3 of @xmath11 are distinct , this fixes the hamiltonian basis , i.e. , we have @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the projector on the eigenspace of @xmath11 corresponding to @xmath3 ,",
    "i.e. , the computational basis state @xmath34",
    ". however , no information about the eigenvalues @xmath35 or the transition frequencies @xmath36 can be obtained by measuring @xmath37 , all of which are constant in this case .",
    "maximum information about the hamiltonian can be obtained if @xmath8 and @xmath11 are not simulataneously block - diagonalizable .",
    "this is the generic case , and in this case we can identify @xmath8 at most up to a diagonal unitary matrix @xmath38 and a global energy shift @xmath39 , i.e. , @xmath40 , as was noted in  @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath39 is generally physically insignificant as it gives rise only a global phase factor @xmath41 , which is generally unobservable , as the abelian phase factors cancel , @xmath42 for any @xmath12 .",
    "the diagonal unitary matrix @xmath43 represents the freedom to redefine the measurement basis states , @xmath44 as @xmath45 .",
    "the phases @xmath46 can not be ignored in general but in certain special cases they can be effectively eliminated .",
    "for example , if @xmath8 is known to be real - symmetric , a common case in physics , then we can choose all basis vectors to be real and restrict @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , if the off - diagonal elements in the computational basis are known to be real and positive , @xmath49 , then @xmath50 with @xmath31 as above . hence , with this additional constraint the hamiltonian is effectively uniquely determined ( up to a global energy level shift and global inversion of the energy levels ) .",
    "a constructive procedure for reconstructing a generic unknown hamiltonian from stroboscopic measurements of the observables @xmath37 at fixed times @xmath51 using bayesian parameter estimation techniques was also given in  @xcite .",
    "the previous section shows that when essentially no a - priori information about the hamiltonian is available then even measurement of all the observables @xmath37 is not sufficient to uniquely determine the hamiltonian .",
    "however , in many cases some a - priori knowledge about the system is available .",
    "for instance , the transition frequencies @xmath52 of the system , where @xmath53 are the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath8 , may be known from available spectroscopic data , and we may be able to infer basics such as the level structure and allowed transitions from fundamental physical principles . in such cases",
    "the identification problem can be substantially simplified and far less information may be required .    as a specific simple example , consider a three - level system with known transition frequencies @xmath54 and @xmath55 and no direct transitions between states @xmath56 and @xmath57 subject to external fields driving the @xmath58 and @xmath59 transitions , respectively .",
    "if our computational / measurement basis coincides with the eigenbasis of the undriven system , then we know that the hamiltonian of the driven system must be of the form @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 $ ] , i.e. , we have only two unknowns , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . if we take the field to be of the form @xmath65 , i.e. , consisting of two components that resonantly drive the @xmath58 and @xmath59 transition , then transforming to a rotating frame and making the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , we obtain an effective hamiltonian @xmath66 $ ] , where @xmath67 for @xmath68 . if the field amplitudes @xmath69 are constant , this hamiltonian is constant and we could use the general protocol in @xcite to fully characterize the dynamics by stroboscopically measuring the probabilities @xmath37 for @xmath70 at sufficiently many times @xmath6 .",
    "this requires the ability to initialize the system in all three basis states @xmath4 and measure the populations of all three states . due to conservation of probability @xmath71 and symmetry",
    "@xmath72 , the requirements can be reduced to initialization and measurement in two basis states , e.g. , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , as the remaining probabilities can be inferred from the other two , but we can do even better by using all the information available .",
    "we shall assume @xmath73 and @xmath74 are real and positive .",
    "for notational convenience , let @xmath75 and @xmath76 be the polar coordinates of the vector @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78 and @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 $ ] . then @xmath82 is @xmath83\\\\    -i c\\sin(\\omega t ) & \\cos(\\omega t ) &",
    "-is\\sin(\\omega t)\\\\    cs[\\cos(\\omega t)-1 ] & -is\\sin(\\omega t ) & s^2\\cos(\\omega t)+c^2   \\end{bmatrix}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this shows immediately that a single measurement trace @xmath86 except @xmath87 contains information about both parameters and thus should be sufficient to fully identify the hamiltonian .",
    "specifically , if we choose to measure @xmath88 we obtain @xmath89 using @xmath90 $ ] and setting @xmath91 .",
    "this shows that there are three frequency components @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , whose amplitudes determine @xmath95 .",
    "the form of @xmath88 suggests fourier analysis to determine the parameters @xmath93 and @xmath95 , e.g. , by identifying the non - zero fourier components .",
    "the highest frequency peak will be at @xmath94 and the corresponding peak amplitude @xmath96 uniquely determines @xmath97 . in some cases ( as in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) there may be only one clearly identifiable non - zero peak in the power spectrum , which could correspond to either @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "this problem can in principle be overcome by estimating @xmath98 from the average signal @xmath99 , from which we can obtain estimates for the coefficients @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "if @xmath102 then we identify the non - zero - frequency peak with @xmath94 , otherwise with @xmath93 .",
    "alternatively , we can estimate the base frequency @xmath93 and the signal amplitudes using a bayesian approach .",
    "the signal in our case is a linear combination of the basis functions @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 . following standard techniques ,",
    "we maximize the log - likelihood function  @xcite @xmath106,\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the number of basis functions , @xmath108 in our case , @xmath109 is the number of data points , and @xmath110 where the elements @xmath111 of @xmath112-vector @xmath113 are projections of the @xmath114-data vector @xmath115 onto a set of orthonormal basis vectors derived from the non - orthogonal basis functions @xmath116 evaluated at the respective sample times @xmath6 . concretely , setting @xmath117 , let @xmath35 and @xmath118 be the eigenvalues and corresponding ( normalized ) eigenvectors of the @xmath119 matrix @xmath120 with @xmath121 , and let @xmath122 be a matrix whose columns are @xmath118",
    ". then we have @xmath123 and @xmath124 with @xmath125 , and the corresponding coefficient vector is @xmath126 .    in our case the @xmath127 is a function of a single frequency @xmath128 and @xmath93 is the frequency for which @xmath127 achieves its global maximum",
    ". if @xmath129 is the corresponding coefficient vector , we can obtain the best estimate for @xmath130 and thus @xmath95 by minimizing @xmath131 with @xmath132 as defined above .",
    "thus , the problem of finding the most likely model @xmath133 is reduced to finding the global maximum of @xmath127 .",
    "unfortunately , this is not an easy task as @xmath127 is sharply peaked and can have many local extrema and a substantial noise floor depending on the number and accuracy of the data points .",
    "one way to circumvent this problem is to use the peaks in the discrete fourier spectrum @xmath134 of the data @xmath115 as input for a gradient - based optimization of @xmath127 . to make the peak detection simpler and more robust , especially when the data is noisy ,",
    "we find the position @xmath135 of the highest peak in the rescaled power spectrum @xmath136|^2 + 1]$ ] , which should correspond to either @xmath93 or @xmath94 , and then find the location of the maxima @xmath137 and @xmath138 of @xmath127 in the intervals @xmath139 $ ] and @xmath140 $ ] , where @xmath141 depends on the resolution of the discrete fourier transform , e.g. , @xmath142 for regularly sampled data .",
    "we take the best estimate @xmath143 for the system frequency @xmath93 to be @xmath137 if @xmath144 , and @xmath138 otherwise , where @xmath145 for @xmath146 .",
    "if @xmath147 and @xmath148 differ by less than a certain amount we can flag the system suggesting that more data is needed for reliable discrimination .    to test this strategy 30 hamiltonians @xmath149 with @xmath150 $ ] and @xmath151 $ ] and a range of sampling time vectors @xmath152 with @xmath153 $ ] were generated with the number of samples @xmath109 ranging from @xmath154 to @xmath155 .",
    "regular and irregular time vector samplings were considered , where for irregular samples a ( fast ) non - uniform fourier transform was used  @xcite . for each test system and time vector @xmath156 ,",
    "noisy data vectors @xmath115 were generated by simulating actual experiments , noting that in a laboratory experiment each data point @xmath157 would normally be estimated by initializing the system in state @xmath56 , letting it evolve for time @xmath6 , and performing a projective measurement @xmath158 , whose outcome is random , either @xmath92 or @xmath159 . to estimate the probability @xmath160 the experiment is repeated many times and @xmath160 approximated by the relative frequency @xmath157 of @xmath159 s .",
    "the simplest approach is to use a fixed number of experiment repetitions @xmath161 for each time @xmath6 , but noting that the uncertainty of the estimate @xmath157 of @xmath160 is @xmath162 shows that it is advantageous to adjust the number of repetitions @xmath161 for each time @xmath6 to achieve a more uniform signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "specifically , for each data point we sample until @xmath163 or we reach a maximum number of repetitions ( here @xmath164 ) .",
    "although the projection noise for a single data point is poissonian , the overall error distribution for a large number of samples is roughly gaussian , justifying the use of a gaussian error model in the bayesian analysis .",
    "as the resolution of the discrete fourier transform and hence the scaled power spectrum is approximately @xmath165 , and generally somewhat less for irregular sampling , the uncertainty in the peak positions of the power spectrum will generally be at least @xmath166 , limiting the accuracy of the frequency estimates , in our case to @xmath167 , regardless of the number of data points .",
    "this is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which shows that the peak in power spectrum is relatively broad , compared to the peak in the likelihood function .",
    "furthermore , the frequency range covered by the power spectrum depends on the sampling frequency , or the number of data points @xmath109 , with the largest discernible frequency approximately @xmath168 .",
    "if the system frequency @xmath93 is outside this range covered by the power spectrum , we are unable to detect it . for example , for a system with @xmath169 , we require @xmath170 and thus @xmath171 data points ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath172 and @xmath109 are sufficiently large to avoid such problems , the location @xmath135 of the global maximum of the power spectrum usually provides a good starting point for finding the global optimum of the log - likelihood function but we can generally substantially improve the frequency estimates using the likelihood . of 14440 data sets analyzed ( 30 test systems sampled at different times ) @xmath135 differed by less than 1% from the true system frequency @xmath93 , or @xmath94 , i.e. , @xmath173 with @xmath174 in about half ( 7321 ) the cases . for almost all failed cases the number of data points was too small and @xmath93 outside the range of the power spectrum .",
    "even when restricted to the successful cases as defined above , the median of @xmath175 was @xmath176 , while the median of the relative error @xmath177 of the final estimate @xmath143 obtained by maximizing the likelihood was @xmath178 .",
    "we also considered finding the global maximum of the likelihood by other means , especially in those cases for which the power spectrum does not provide a useful initial frequency estimator . since we have a function of a single parameter and evaluation of the likelihood , especially when the number of data points is small , is not expensive , it is possible to find the global maximum simply by exhaustive search .",
    "interestingly , we found that log - likelihood still had a clearly identifiable global maximum in many cases even when the number of data points @xmath109 was far below the minimum number of sample points required to detect a peak in the power spectrum .",
    "e.g. , for the system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the likelihood function still has a sharp peak around the system frequency @xmath93 even if the number of samples is reduced to @xmath179 , while the peak is no longer detectable in the power spectrum even for @xmath180 samples . however , as we reduce the number of samples additional peaks in the likelihood function tend to emerge at multiples or fractions of @xmath93 , as shown in the top inset of fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "this means that we can no longer unambiguously identify the true frequency @xmath93 .",
    "such aliasing problems leading to sampling artefacts in the data analysis can be sustantially reduced by avoiding uniform sampling at equally spaced times ( cf fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , top inset ) . in particular low - discrepancy sequences have been introduced with the aim to create a sampling with minimal regular patterns causing sampling artefacts , but also minimising the average gap between the samples for a fixed number of samples  @xcite . here",
    "in particular we use a stratified sampling strategy , where a point is placed in each stratum of a regular grid according to a uniform probability distribution .",
    "this _ may _ be improved further using other low - discrepancy sequences  @xcite .",
    "the results are relevant as a significant reduction in the number of data points required reduces experimental overheads substantially .",
    "this comes at additional computational costs , as finding the global maximum of the likelihood function for irregular samplings with very few data points forms a hard optimization problem .",
    "several standard optimization algorithms ( simple pattern search and stochastic gradient decent ) failed to reliably detect the global optimum , and exhaustive search had to be used .     for data sampled at different times @xmath181 in @xmath182 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath183 the power spectra have a single peak in the plotted range , which is a reasonable estimate for @xmath93 .",
    "for @xmath184 and below , the main peak is outside the range of the power spectrum and the former no longer contains any useful information . yet",
    ", the log - likelihood still has a clearly identifiable global maximum at @xmath93 even for data vectors with as few as 32 data points , provided a non - uniform sampling is used .",
    "for uniform sampling with @xmath185 the top inset shows that @xmath127 has many peaks of approximately equal height due to aliasing effects ( dashed black line ) . ]",
    "we have considered hamiltonian identification using stroboscopic measurement data of a fixed observable .",
    "if the system can only be initialized in the measurement basis states then a completely unknown hamiltonian can not be uniquely identified even if we can measure the population of all basis states as a function of time .",
    "if a - priori information is available , however , complete identification of the system parameters is often possible with substantially reduced resources .",
    "we have illustrated this for the case of a three - level system where we can only monitor the population of state @xmath56 over time , starting in @xmath56 , without the possibility of dynamic control or feedback as was considered in @xcite .",
    "the results may be applicable to improve the efficiency of identification schemes for other systems .",
    "e.g. , recent work on system identification for spin networks @xcite has shown that the relevant hamiltonian parameters of a spin chain can be identified by mapping the evolution of the first spin and fourier analysis , but the scheme requires repeated quantum state tomography of the first spin for many times @xmath6 , which is experimentally expensive .",
