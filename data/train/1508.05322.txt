    "theoretical and experimental investigations of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperatures are performed with the aim to gain insights to the mechanisms of chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement . from this perspective the heavy - quark ( hq ) potential is one of the most important probes to be studied . in the vacuum",
    "the heavy quark - antiquark system is well described in terms of effective field theories , owing to the energy scale separation @xcite and the fact that the hq potential can be properly defined in terms of large wilson loops .",
    "then the spectrum of charmonium and bottomonium states as solutions of the schrdinger equation for heavy quarkonia can be extracted and faced experiment .",
    "finite temperature studies rely on the extraction of a static potential from _ ab initio _ simulations of lattice qcd ( lqcd ) considering the singlet free energy due to a pair of static color charges as a function of their distance by means of polyakov loop correlators @xcite . however , the systematic field theoretic description within the nrqcd framework @xcite is much more subtle and delicate because new variable energy scales like the temperature @xmath0 or the screening mass @xmath1 enter the problem distorting the energy hierarchy .",
    "in addition , from the definition of a real - time potential @xcite it was realized that also an imaginary part in the potential appears at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "using lattice qcd studies of this complex values static potential it was recently found that the real part is well described by the color singlet free energy of a static quark - antiquark pair @xcite .",
    "while those results shed light on the important question about the identification of the hq potential with the colour singlet free energy @xcite another important question is that of microphysics insights into the screening mechanism .",
    "based on some first principle motivations @xcite , riek and rapp have proposed an ansatz for the hq potential @xcite in the form of a screened cornell potential where the coulomb and the linear parts are subject to two different screening masses @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the fit of the temperature dependence of these parameters provided in ref .",
    "@xcite using available lqcd data has revealed some unexpected aspects .",
    "first , the coulombic debye mass @xmath1 has a linear behaviour with very small slope ( smaller than expected from pqcd ) .",
    "second , the screening mass of the confining part , @xmath2 , shows a strong suppression for temperatures below @xmath3 and a linear rise for high temperatures ( higher than expected from pqcd ) .",
    "this is somehow different from the standard approach , where the lqcd data for the large distance part of this hq potential are fitted either to a debye screened coulomb ansatz or to a form motivated by a debye - hckel theory @xcite .",
    "an ansatz taking into account real and imaginary parts of the hq potential has been recently considered in @xcite in the context of quenched lattice data .",
    "here we use @xmath4 from lqcd data with dynamical fermions obtained from fitting the heavy quark - antiquark free energy at large separations to the standard debye screened potential @xcite to compare with the model predictions . while its behaviour well above the pseudocritical temperature @xmath3 of the qcd phase transition can qualitatively be understood in terms of perturbation theory , the interpretation of the lattice data in the vicinity of @xmath3 require essentially nonperturbative approaches addressing effects of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the leading order perturbative result reads @xmath5 , while the next - to - leading order can be obtained by resummation of the leading contribution of the high temperature expansion @xcite .",
    "a detailed understanding of the physics behind the debye mass in the nonperturbative domain is subject to many current studies .",
    "approaches based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite , gauge / gravity duality @xcite or phenomenological models @xcite make an attempt to give a microscopic description of the screening phenomenon .",
    "however , the very definition and numerical determination of a screening mass is obscured by the complications of the non - abelian nature of qcd and the large value of the coupling constant near the qcd transition region @xcite .",
    "in this paper we investigate screening effects in a pnjl model which proved successful in reproducing various aspects of hadronic excitations in the medium @xcite and of lqcd thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "we will evaluate the one - loop polarization function using pnjl propagators with qed like vertices thus extending a previous calculation made for massless quarks @xcite . in this rough way we implement confinement and chiral symmetry breaking effects which in turn allows a comparison to the lattice data for the debye mass .",
    "we will show that one can reproduce the correct shape of its temperature dependence .",
    "however , due to the absence of dynamical gluons in our pnjl model calculation , we lack dynamical degrees of freedom and therefore stay below the lqcd result .",
    "it is well known that the screening mass in qed or pqcd can also be derived from kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "interrelations between plasma physics and quark gluon plasma are known to bring many relevant insights and physical motivation behind the field theory calculations @xcite .",
    "we also explore this possibility and modify the standard kinetic theory approach by replacing usual fermi - dirac distribution functions for quarks with those modified by the coupling to the polyakov loop . in this way we are able to reproduce the result for the debye mass calculated within our model and furthermore to achieve contact with qcd by inclusion of effects of perturbative non - abelian vertices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model_md ]",
    "we outline the model calculation of the debye mass within the pnjl model , whereby details are referred to the appendix .",
    "section [ kintheo ] presents the kinetic theory approach to the problem where we give a simple and intuitive derivation of the screening mass suggesting a straightforward modification of the standard approach .",
    "section [ lqcd ] is devoted to a comparison with lqcd data and their interpretation while section [ concl ] gives the conclusions .",
    "in reference @xcite a model was considered where the vacuum hq potential was screened by a quark loop with internal lines coupled to a temporal background gluon field . for the static interaction potential @xmath6 , @xmath7 ,",
    "the statically screened potential is given by a resummation of one - particle irreducible diagrams ( rpa `` bubble '' resummation ) @xmath8~ , \\label{vsc}\\ ] ] where the longitudinal polarization function in the finite temperature case is defined via the projector decomposition of the self energy ( in euclidean space ) @xmath9 where the projectors satisfy @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the euclidean four momentum . from this",

    "the case of a massive quark gas is obtained , while for confinement ( @xmath40 ) one finds a considerable suppression .",
    "the temperature dependence of the debye mass is shown in figure  [ fig.1 ] and as expected from the very beginning it turns out to be below the free massless case , in the confined and in the transition region ( with a pseudocritical temperature @xmath41 ) . for temperatures @xmath42 the free gas behaviour @xmath43 is reproduced .",

    "it is well known that in qed the debye mass is related to the pressure via the second derivative @xcite @xmath45 where here @xmath46 is related to the electric charge of the system .",
    "this relation is a consequence of the dyson - schwinger equation for the photon self energy and the ward identity relating the electron - photon vertex to the quark propagator .",
    "this is only true in abelian gauge theory and breaks down for non - abelian theories like qcd . on the technical level the proper ward identity ( called then slavnov - taylor identity )",
    "becomes much more complex and does not allow a simple derivation . because our calculation in this section is similar to a one - loop qed calculation",
    "it is interesting to see if a similar relation holds also in the pnjl model .",

    "there two definitions of the running coupling were used , @xmath89 from a fit using a debye screened coloumb ansatz at large separations and @xmath90 obtained at the maximum of the effective @xmath91 and @xmath0-dependent running coupling .",
    "those results are based on an analysis of gauge field configurations generated by the rbc - bielefeld collaboration in ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd for the calculation of the qcd equation of state @xcite where the pion mass is about 220 mev and the strange quark mass is adjusted to its physical value .    from the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] we see that the general trend of the lattice data is reproduced .",
    "the fact that our result for the debye mass stays below the lattice data is due to the lack of dynamical gluons which in full qcd also bring a contribution to the screening effects .",

    "in this short note we have presented a calculation of the quark contribution to the debye screening mass using the pnjl model which captures chiral dynamics and in a very rough way some aspects of confinement .",
    "we have compared our results to the debye masses extracted from lattice qcd simulations of the static heavy - quark potential and obtain overall agreement for the shape of the temperature dependence . naturally",
    ", our results for the debye mass stay below the lattice results since in our model the gluon contribution is neglected .",
    "however , as the observed gluon contribution on the lattice is of the same shape @xcite we are convinced that our model captures the essentials of the influence of chiral dynamics and confinement on the screening of the heavy - quark potential .",
    "a further improvement of the calculation would be to include dynamical gluons into the system , to improve the modelling of quark ( and gluon ) confinement and to elaborate on the behaviour of the running coupling constant .",
    "the latter should also be compared with the lattice qcd result for this quantity as it is obtained simultaneously with that for the debye mass . at this point",
    "it is interesting to go back to the different interpretations of the same lattice data .",
    "here we would like to mention the one by ref .",
    "@xcite where the ansatz of a screened corrnell type potential was adopted with two different debye masses , one for the linear confining part ( @xmath92 ) and one for the coulombic part ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the performed fit gave a drastically different behaviour of the two screening masses .",
    "the temperature dependence obtained for @xmath92 appears similar to that of the debye mass in the present approach , calculated for a @xmath0- independent coupling constant ( see fig .  [ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "the physical reason for such a distinction could be that the stringy and the coulombic parts of the potential act on different length scales so that the screening of them involves different dynamics .",
    "the linear part should be dominant for larger distances thus involving stronger interactions and more correlations in the screening mechanism .",
    "thus one could expect that @xmath93 for all temperatures which is the finding of @xcite .",
    "this is , however , only a qualitative argument .",
    "our calculation , since it is at one - loop order with a qed like interaction should apply to the screened coulomb potential part from which the lattice qcd result has been extracted . as has been demonstrated here",

    "<S> the role of the gluon background ( polyakov loop ) is to provide strong suppression of the number of charge carriers below the transition temperature , as an effect of confinement , while the temperature dependent dynamical quark mass contributes additional suppression , as an effect of chiral symmetry breaking . </S>",
