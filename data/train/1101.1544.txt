    "as it is shown in ref.[1 ] , spherically symmetric perturbations of friedmann metrics are described by one scalar function @xmath1 ) connected with perturbation of the metric tensor component @xmath2 in the isotropic coordinates @xmath3 with the relation @xmath4 at that the representation turns out to be convenient    @xmath5    it allows to factor the solution into particlelike mode    @xmath6    equivalent to newton potential of the point mass @xmath7 , and the nonsingular mode    @xmath8    the `` potential '' of which @xmath9 and its first derivative by a radial variable at the beginning of the coordinates satisfy the relations    @xmath100,\\quad \\quad \\mathop{\\lim } \\limits_{r\\to 0 } \\left|r\\frac{\\partial \\psi ( r,\\eta ) } { \\partial r } \\right|=0.\\ ] ]    by a constant coefficient of barotrope @xmath11 the mass of a particle source @xmath12 and the nonsingular mode potential @xmath9 satisfy the evolutionary equations ( 75 ) and ( 84 ) [ 1 ] :    @xmath13    @xmath14    in the previous paper [ 1 ] an exact solution of the evolutionary equation for the particlelike source mass was also obtained    @xmath15    @xmath16    in [ 1 ] it was noted that the peculiarity in the solution by @xmath17 is coordinate disappearing by coming from the temporal coordinate @xmath18 to the physical time @xmath19",
    "@xmath20    let us recall , the nonsingular part of the energy density perturbation @xmath21 and the radial velocity of medium @xmath22 are determined with help of the potential function @xmath9 by the relations    @xmath23    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is a nonperturbed energy density of friedmann universe ?",
    "@xmath26    in [ 1 ] by the variables separation method a general solution of the evolutionary equation satisfying the conditions in form of an integral from bessel functions was also obtained . in this paper",
    "we shall obtain more convenient solutions in form of power series .      as it was shown in the previous paper [ 1 ] , the singular part of the potential function @xmath30 is uniquely extracted by the representation in which the potential function @xmath9 is nonsingular at the beginning of the coordinates , that is satisfies the relations in consequence of which ,",
    "in particular    @xmath31    further supposing in the final neighborhood @xmath32 in which the metrics perturbation is localized , the potential function @xmath9 belongs to the @xmath27class , let us represent the solution of the evolutionary equation satisfying the conditions in the form of power series of the radial variable @xmath33    @xmath34    let us underline the expansion does not consist of a member with a zero power @xmath33 in consequence of the relation . substituting the function @xmath35 in the form of the eq . into the evolutionary equation and setting the coefficients at each power @xmath33 in the obtained equation equal to zero ,",
    "we get a chain of linking equations    @xmath36    thus , by @xmath28 the general solution of the evolutionary equation for the potential function @xmath37 is a series by odd powers of the radial variable @xmath33 , that is by @xmath38 the potential function @xmath37 of the @xmath27 class is an odd function of the radial variable @xmath33    @xmath39    for the private particle solutions responding the specific physical conditions the series can be broken at any odd @xmath40 . in this case",
    "supposing for the last member of the series    @xmath41    we obtain from the eq .",
    "a closed equation    @xmath42    as far as this equation does not differ from the evolutionary equation for the particlelike source mass at all , its general solution will coincide with the solution accurate within reterming    @xmath43    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are some constants .    substituting this solution into the next to last equation of the chain we shall get the equation for determining @xmath46 :    @xmath47.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in consequence on this equation linearity its general solution is a sum of the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation @xmath48 and a private solution of the inhomogeneous one @xmath49 .",
    "but the general solution of the homogeneous one coincides with the already mentioned above solution , and the private solution can be introduced in the form of a sum of two solutions corresponding to the two members of the right part .",
    "therefore , evidently the corresponding private solution has the form    @xmath50    thus , we find    @xmath51    substituting the obtained solutions into the previous equations let us repeat the analogues calculations/ thus we pointed out the algorithm of constructing a general solution of an evolutionary equation reduced to repeating differentiation operations .",
    "this general solution corresponding to the highest power @xmath52 of the radial variable consists of @xmath53 arbitrary constants appearing every time by solving the corresponding homogeneous differential equations .",
    "let us demonstrate the task solution in the simplest but as it turns out the most important case when @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and the series consists of only two members corresponding to the values@xmath56 . in this case from eqs .",
    "- we find    @xmath57    @xmath58    let us study now the specific cases @xmath59 and @xmath60 which are out of the general solution .      in this case",
    "we get from the law of mass evolution of a particlelike source ( see ref . [ 4 ] )    @xmath61    the equation for the potential function @xmath62 takes the form    @xmath63    whence we find    @xmath64    where @xmath65 are arbitrary functions @xmath33 . in this case",
    "the mass of a particlelike source evolves according to the law    @xmath66      in this case the equation for the field function f is elliptic @xmath68 and the radial velocity of perturbation is not determined by the equation which in this case gives    @xmath69    integrating we find :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are some arbitrary functions of their arguments . substituting this solution into the equation and dividing the variables we find the function @xmath73    @xmath74    where @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are arbitrary constants .",
    "by @xmath78 the spherically symmetric perturbations of friedmann metrics are described by the hyperbolic equation , by @xmath79 - by elliptic one .",
    "peculiarities of the hyperbolic equations are convergent and nonconvergent waves    @xmath80    spreading at the sound velocity    @xmath81    let us study the task for spherically symmetric solutions of linearized einstein equations against the background of friedmann metrics with zero boarding conditions for the potential function @xmath82 at the sound horizon corresponding to the causality principle    @xmath83    in terms of the introduced functions @xmath82 and @xmath84 these conditions can be written in the form    @xmath85    @xmath86    in this case in consequence of the equations for perturbations out of the boundary of the sound horizon the perturbations of energy density , pressure and velocity must automatically turn into zero :    @xmath87    an important private case of the boundary conditions and are the conditions at  the zero sound horizon     @xmath88    @xmath89 in this case instead of and we have",
    "@xmath90      let us study some private solutions in the form of power series by radial variable satisfying the boundary conditions .",
    "such perturbations can be generated by the metrics fluctuations at zero moment of time and concentrated at this moment of time in zero volume .",
    "coming to the most convenient radial variable @xmath91    @xmath92    in the case of @xmath93 let us write down the field equations and .",
    "the dot denotes derivatieves by anew temporal variable    @xmath94    @xmath95    then solving    @xmath96    where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are arbitrary constants .",
    "as far as the taylor - series expansion of the function @xmath99should not consist of the zero power @xmath33 by definition and therefore all the even powers in this expansion automatically vanish , so setting further    @xmath100    and dividing the variables in the equation we get an equation for the functions@xmath101 :    @xmath102    @xmath103    in compliance with we find from    @xmath104    where @xmath105 are some constants ? substituting the solution into the right part of the equation and defining private solutions of the obtained equation we shall find its general solution    @xmath106    thus ,    @xmath107    further calculating @xmath108 , substituting the result into the boundary condition and setting equal the coefficients in the obtained equation by simultaneous powers @xmath18 we shall get a set of equations for the constants @xmath109",
    "@xmath110    thus , there are only two nonzero constants included into the expression for @xmath111 : @xmath98 and @xmath112 .",
    "so , finally @xmath113    @xmath114 it is the obtained previously retarding solution with zero boundary conditions at zero sound horizon [ 2 ] and@xmath115 is the heavyside function . at that supposing the following for the ultrarelativistic equation of state    @xmath116    we obtain    @xmath117    it is easy to see that in this case at the surface of zero sound front @xmath118 the boundary conditions are fulfilled identically .",
    "now let us study the fifth degree multinomial as a solution . in this case instead of the relations",
    "and we have    @xmath119    @xmath120    @xmath121    @xmath122    similarly to the previous case we have    @xmath123    substituting into the right part of the equation , solving it similarly to the previous case and substituting the obtained solution into the equation we get finally    @xmath124    @xmath125    and thus    @xmath126    @xmath127    substituting the equation into the boundary conditions and equating the coefficients under equal @xmath18 degrees we get equations for the constants @xmath109    @xmath128    thus ,    @xmath129    and the rest constants values coincide with the obtained ones above .",
    "it means that the solution coincides with the obtained one above .",
    "it is easy to show , adding of any new members of the series does not change the situation .",
    "thus , we have proved the theorem :    * theorem 1 . * _ the only spherically - symmetric solution of the @xmath0 class of linearized around friedmann space - plane solution to the einstein equations for an ideal ultrarelativistic fluid , corresponding to the zero boundary conditions at the zero sound horizon , is the solution ( it is equivalent to ( 55))_.      from the formula one can immediately see continuity of not only the first radial derivatives but also the first temporal ones of the @xmath130 metrics perturbation and the potential functions    @xmath131    @xmath132    in fig.1 and 2 graphs of temporal evolution of the potential functions @xmath133 and @xmath134 are shown    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "summarizing let us point out the following .",
    "it is easy to see that the obtained general retarding solution with a central singular source coincides with the earlier obtained ones [ 2],[3],[4]and [ 5 ] .",
    "however , note that in the mentioned works the solutions - were pointed out as private retarding solutions .",
    "the obtained retarding solutions belong to the class @xmath0 , however the second derivatives by radial variable have a break of the first genus at the sound horizon . as a result",
    "the energy density break at the sound horizon corresponds to the obtained retarding solution . because of the pointed out conditions to find out the nature of the density break it is necessary to solve two tasks : to find the retarding solution for the barotrope arbitrary coefficient and solve the cauchy task for the initially localized perturbation .",
