    "more than three decades ago partridge and peebles ( 1967 ) predicted that galaxies in their first throes of star - formation should be strong emitters in the ly-@xmath0 line .",
    "their predictions were optimistic , based on converting roughly 2% of gas into metals in @xmath2 years in milky way sized galaxies , which translates into a line luminosity of @xmath3 .",
    "these objects are also expected to be common - if all the @xmath4 galaxies have undergone such a phase of rapid star - formation one should see a surface density of about @xmath5 per square - degree .",
    "searches based on these expectations did not detect ly-@xmath0 emitters ( see review by pritchet 1994 ) . only recently",
    "have ly-@xmath0 emitters been discovered , ( lowenthal et al 1997 ; cowie & hu 1998 ; hu , cowie & mcmahon 1998 ; dey et al 1998 ; hu , mcmahon , & cowie 1999 ; kudritzki et al 2000 , rhoads et al . 2000 ) , but at luminosities roughly a hundred times fainter and the total number discovered remains small .",
    "in order to get statistically useful samples we started an efficient search for ly-@xmath0 emitters ( and other emission line galaxies ) in 1998 using the ccd mosaic camera at the kitt peak national observatory s 4 m mayall telescope . the mosaic camera has eight @xmath6 chips in a @xmath7 array comprising a @xmath8 field of view .",
    "the final area covered by the lala survey is @xmath9 square - degrees in two mosaic fields .",
    "five overlapping narrow band filters with full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath10are used .",
    "the total redshift coverage is @xmath11 .",
    "this translates into surveyed comoving volume of @xmath12 @xmath13 per field for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "about 70% of the imaging at @xmath17 is complete , and an extension of the survey to @xmath18 has started . in about 6 hours per filter per field we are able to achieve line detections of about @xmath19 .",
    "broadband images of these fields in a custom @xmath20 filter ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) and the johnson - cousins @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 bands are being taken as part of the noao deep wide - field survey ( jannuzi & dey 1999 ) .",
    "pilot spectroscopic studies were carried out to confirm emission line candidates .",
    "this is necessary because the narrow band selection criterion picks up [ oiii ] emitters at z=0.3 , [ oii ] emitters at z=0.8 as well as ly-@xmath0 emitters at z=4.5 . in case of [ oiii ]",
    "emitters at z=0.3 , the spectra show three lines , two of [ oiii ] and h@xmath26 and in most cases , h@xmath0 .",
    "we can often see the [ oiii ] and h@xmath26 lines for the [ oii ] emitters depending on the wavelength coverage .",
    "some of the [ oii ] and all ly-@xmath0 emitters show only one line each in the wavelength range covered , so a one - line spectrum may be either a z=0.8 or a z=4.5 object .",
    "the confirmation of the ly-@xmath0 line is largely circumstantial .",
    "an asymmetric line and a continuum drop blueward of the line due to intergalactic absorption are the signatures of the ly-@xmath0 line ( stern & spinrad 1999 ) . in sources where we do not detect the continuum",
    ", the high equivalent width of the line provides the ( somewhat weaker ) evidence that the line in question is indeed ly-@xmath0 .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of a cross - section of emission line candidates was obtained with the lris instrument ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) at the keck 10 m telescope on 1999 june 13 ( ut ) and april 2000 .",
    "the june 1999 mask yielded one , perhaps two , ly-@xmath0 emitters .",
    "the april 2000 mask had a better detection rate as we had used broad band colors to reduce the contamination by foregroud emission line galaxies .",
    "it yielded 4 more ly-@xmath0 emitters .",
    "from the few spectroscopic confirmations and many candidates we estimate about 4000 emitters per square degree per unit redshift ( rhoads et al .",
    "2000 ) . within the present uncertainties",
    "the number density of ly-@xmath0 emitters is 3 times higher than the lyman break galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) of similar brightness and redshifts .",
    "the star - formation rates estimated for the ly-@xmath0 galaxies are 0.5 - 2 times the star - formation rate derived for continuum selected galaxies at similar redshifts ( madau et al . 1996 ) . at present",
    "there are large uncertainties in the lala numbers due to the small sample of spectroscopic confirmations .    while the original predictions were for strong ly-@xmath0 emission ,",
    "the recent detections are roughly a hundred times fainter .",
    "prior to the discoveries of ly-@xmath0 emitters , many scenarios had been proposed to explain the non - detections .",
    "now that we find ly-@xmath0 sources , understanding the faintness of this line will be valuable to understanding star and galaxy formation this early in the universe .",
    "\\(a ) it is possible that early star formation occurred in smaller , sub - galactic units , which later merged to form the large galaxies we see today . in this ,",
    "case the line luminosity l@xmath27 should be small while its equivalent width remains large",
    ". two of the confirmed @xmath28 ly-@xmath0 sources lie only @xmath29 apart and may indeed be interacting or merging .",
    "\\(b ) even modest amounts of dust can strongly quench the line : ly-@xmath0 photons are resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen , which can force them to escape from galaxies by a random walk process in which they traverse a much longer path length for dust absorption than do continuum photons at similar wavelengths . in this case , both l@xmath27 and @xmath30 should be substantially reduced from the simplest dust - free predictions .",
    "most of the spectroscopically confirmed lala sources have rest - frame @xmath31 which argues for dust - free star - formation scenarios .",
    "this by itself is not a strong argument , since the narrow band selection picks out high equivalent width sources .",
    "comparison of the populations of line - selected and continuum selected sources would tell us how many galaxies at these redshifts are dust - poor enough to show high equivalent width ly-@xmath0 emission .",
    "\\(c ) similarly , early star - formation could have a longer time - scale than a dynamical time postulated by pp67 .",
    "nir colors along with stellar population modelling can help to determine whether there is some relatively old population ( age @xmath32 years ) , along with the young stars .",
    "\\(d ) even if the star - formation is dust - free , it is quite likely that neutral gas extends beyond the star - formation regions . in this case",
    "ly-@xmath0 photons will diffuse out of the surface area of the larger hi envelope and ly-@xmath0 emission will be extended and fall below the surface brightness detection limits .",
    "\\(e ) winds : in low redshift universe , the galaxies that show ly-@xmath0 emission are not the most metal poor ( and hence dust free ) galaxies , but galaxies which show outflows ( kunth et al . 1998 ) .",
    "large velocity gradients doppler shift the ly-@xmath0 photons so they no longer resonantly scatter .",
    "however , the high redshift ly-@xmath0 sources emit @xmath33 times more in line luminosity than these local sources , and it is not clear if the same mechanism is responsible for the ly-@xmath0 escape in both contexts . if it is indeed winds that are responsible for the escape of ly-@xmath0 photons at higher redshifts , these winds probably have 100 times the kinetic energy of their local counterparts and therefore are significant polluters of the intergalactic medium",
    ". either high resolution spectroscopy or morphological comparison in continuum and ly-@xmath0 line emission will allow us to search for evidence for such winds , and wind blown bubbles .",
