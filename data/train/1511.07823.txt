    "maximal @xmath0-regularity _ if the solution of the evolution equation @xmath7 satisfies @xmath8 for some ( or , as it turns out , for all ) @xmath1 . on a hilbert space ,",
    "every generator of a bounded analytic semigroup has maximal @xmath0-regularity @xcite , and hilbert spaces are the only banach spaces for which this holds true @xcite . beyond hilbert spaces ,",
    "a characterization of the maximal @xmath0-regularity was given by weis @xcite on @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 and @xmath11 a region in @xmath12 ) and more generally on umd spaces in terms of the @xmath3-boundedness of the resolvent operator .",
    "operators having maximal @xmath0-regularity include elliptic differential operators on @xmath13 with general boundary conditions , and operators that generate a positive and contractive semigroup on @xmath14 spaces for an arbitrary measure space @xmath15 , as do many generators of stochastic processes ; see @xcite and references therein .    in this paper",
    "we address the following question : _ given an operator @xmath5 that has maximal @xmath0-regularity , for which ( if any ) time discretization methods for is the maximal @xmath0-regularity preserved in the discrete @xmath2-setting , uniformly in the stepsize ? _    we will show that this holds for _ a - stable _ multistep and runge  kutta methods , under minor additional conditions .",
    "in particular , the implicit euler method , the crank  nicolson method , the second - order backward difference formula ( bdf ) , and higher - order a - stable implicit runge  kutta methods such as the radau iia and gauss methods all preserve maximal regularity .",
    "we recall that a numerical time discretization method is called a - stable if for every complex @xmath16 with @xmath17 , for every stepsize @xmath18 , and for arbitrary starting values , the numerical solution of the scalar linear differential equation @xmath19 remains bounded as the discrete time goes to @xmath20 .",
    "it is remarkable that this deceivingly simple and well - studied concept , which was introduced by dahlquist @xcite , essentially suffices to yield maximal @xmath2-regularity , uniformly in the stepsize for every operator @xmath5 that has maximal @xmath0-regularity , both on hilbert spaces and on a large class of banach spaces .",
    "our proofs rely on weis characterization of maximal @xmath0-regularity on umd spaces @xcite , on a discrete operator - valued fourier multiplier theorem of blunck @xcite , and on generating function techniques for time discretization methods , which have been familiar for linear multistep methods since the work of dahlquist @xcite , but are less common for runge  kutta methods @xcite .",
    "a characterization of discrete maximal @xmath2-regularity for recurrence relations @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) was given in @xcite , and a generalization of these results to the explicit euler scheme with certain non - constant time step sequences was given in @xcite ; also see @xcite .",

    "maximal @xmath0-regularity of finite element spatial semi - discretizations of parabolic pdes has been used in the analysis of numerical methods for pdes with minimal regularity assumption on the solution @xcite or on the diffusion coefficient @xcite . in order to prove the convergence of fully discrete solutions of some nonlinear pdes , e.g. , the dynamic ginzburg ",
    "landau equations @xcite , maximal @xmath0-regularity in the time - discrete setting as given here is needed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section  [ section : preliminaries ]",
    "we recall important notions and results from the theory of maximal parabolic regularity : weis characterization of maximal @xmath0-regularity on umd spaces , @xmath3-boundedness , and operator - valued fourier multipliers in a banach space setting @xcite .    in section  [ section : ie and cn ]",
    "we show discrete maximal @xmath2-regularity estimates for two simple one - step methods , the backward euler method and the crank  nicolson scheme .",
    "this allows us to show the basic arguments in a technically simpler setting than for the other methods considered in later sections .    in sections [ section : bdf ] and [ section : rk ]",
    "maximal @xmath2-regularity results are shown for higher order methods , backward difference formulae ( bdf ) and a - stable runge  kutta methods , respectively .",
    "while linear multistep methods have a scalar differentiation symbol in the appearing generating functions , the differentiation symbol of runge  kutta methods is matrix - valued , which makes the analysis more complicated .    in section [ section : full discretization ] we briefly discuss maximal regularity of full discretizations and show how uniformity of the bounds in both the spatial gridsize @xmath23 and the temporal stepsize @xmath24 can be obtained .",
    "in section  [ section : ell infty est ] we give @xmath25-bounds that show maximal regularity up to a factor that is logarithmic in the number of time steps considered .",
    "these bounds are obtained for a subclass of methods that includes the bdf and radau iia methods , but not the crank - nicolson and gauss methods .",
    "the @xmath25-bounds rely on the convolution quadrature interpretation of linear multistep methods @xcite and runge  kutta methods @xcite .",
    "a related result has recently been proved for discontinuous galerkin time - stepping methods in @xcite , using different techniques",
    ".    finally , in section  [ section : applications ] we illustrate the use of discrete maximal @xmath2-regularity in deriving error bounds for discretizations of nonlinear parabolic pdes .",
    "we show that in contrast to previously existing techniques , the approach via discrete maximum regularity enables us to obtain optimal - order error bounds without any growth condition on the pointwise nonlinearity @xmath26 and also for nonlinearities having singularities .",
    "this becomes possible because via the discrete maximal @xmath2-regularity we can control the @xmath27-norm of the error , provided the exact solution of the parabolic problem has sufficient regularity .",
    "here we collect basic results on maximal @xmath0-regularity and related concepts , which will be needed later on . for further background and details , proofs and references",
