    "renormalizable quantum field theories like qed , qcd or pseudoscalar yukawa theory are characterised by anomalous dimensions which determine the asymptotic properties of the green functions as all momenta are scaled .",
    "specifically the anomalous dimension @xmath2 of a quantum field is determined through the asymptotic behaviour of the propagator @xmath3 when @xmath4 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath2 as a power series in the renormalized coupling constant @xmath0 , arising in the trilinear interaction lagrangian , has occupied much time and effort and is known up to order @xmath5 for certain models .",
    "it would be nice if one could calculate @xmath2 to all orders of @xmath0 by summing subclasses of diagrams , corresponding to particular topologies , without excessive effort .",
    "this paper is devoted to outlining a method by which this might be achieved .",
    "it is based on conformal scaling of green functions at asymptotic momenta , with anomalous dimensions providing the self - regulation of the field theory @xcite in question .",
    "such a proposal makes eminently good sense at a zero @xmath6 of the beta function on the positive real line and we simply assume that this applies in all that follows .",
    "however it must be pointed out that for the models considered later there is no indication of such a zero and with its corresponding coupling constant .    the basic idea behind the method is to eliminate the renormalization constants as far as it is possible and to write the renormalized green functions in terms of one another as a power series in the coupling constant with ever more complicated topologies .",
    "this produces a set of self - consistent schwinger - dyson equations of the full propagator in terms of itself and the proper vertex part , though there exist infinitely many different topological terms in the skeleton expansion of course . in the end one",
    "is forced to truncate these topological contributions , but in any case it is rather easy to show ( see below ) that the only self - consistent behaviour is one where the anomalous vertex and propagator dimensions are oppositely related .",
    "the equations in principle then yield an equation for the anomalous dimensions in terms of the renormalized coupling constant . in the past",
    "it has proved relatively simple to sum over particular topologies where the vertex function remains undressed , but in this paper we shall emphasize the importance of considering the full three - point vertex ( not just in some kinematic limit ) when studying these equations ; this is the novel aspect of our work and by this means one may hope to improve on the rainbow @xcite , ladder and chain @xcite approximations of diagram sets  the favourite ones studied thus far and with great aplomb by broadhurst and kreimer .    to illustrate what is involved ,",
    "consider the case of the renormalizable @xmath7 interaction in six dimensions , rather than @xmath8 theory @xcite , ignoring triple @xmath9 interactions for the moment .",
    "including renormalization constants , the equation for the @xmath10 and @xmath9 propagators , @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , expressed in terms of full green functions , in the massless case reads @xmath13 @xmath14 for each field , we know that in renormalized perturbation theory the sum of the series will produce the large @xmath15 scaling behaviour , @xmath16 , where @xmath2 is given as a series in @xmath17 , which can be computed appearing in @xmath18 behaves like unity when @xmath19 ; this is because the imaginary part of @xmath20 equals @xmath21 and this generalised function reduces to @xmath22 for the free case @xmath23 . ]",
    "order by order in perturbation theory , albeit with greater and greater pain as the power of @xmath17 rises .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to look for relations between @xmath2 and @xmath17 , which correspond to particular truncations of various topological contributions to the self - energy ; such relations are normally given by a transcendental equation that can be found via the dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "but how do we find them by suitably manipulating eqs ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ?",
    "for the moment neglect the first term on the right , which involves the renormalization constant and seems to scale as @xmath24 ; the remaining terms have the form @xmath25 and we must ask how they sum up to the scaling form on the left - hand side . it is possible , but extremely unlikely , that each of these terms behaves as @xmath24 aside from logarithms and that each contains an infinity ( which is subtracted off by the @xmath26-factor on the right ) and that they somehow combine to produce the anomalous scaling ; if that were true there would be little point in using the skeleton expansion as a means of transcending perturbation theory .",
    "a more likely scenario , which we shall _ assume _ hereafter , is that each of the contributions @xmath27 scale in exactly the same way .",
    "then it is not hard to work out what must be the scaling behaviour of the proper vertex @xmath28 to produce @xmath29 at large @xmath24 .",
    "one easily establishes that @xmath30 will ensure that _ all _ of the topological contributions @xmath27 to the two - point function yield the same scaling as the external momentum @xmath31 .",
    "[ without losing too much generality one may fix the vertex function @xmath32 either at the symmetrical euclidean point @xmath33 * or * at zero - momentum transfer @xmath34 , but that still leaves vast freedom in the dynamics of @xmath28 in ( 2 ) , through its dependence on the momentum ratios . ] as for justifying why we drop the renormalization terms @xmath35 , we note that the wave function renormalization constant may be generally defined by @xmath36 and then @xmath26 can well vanish applies to composite particles and agrees with this observation , but becomes problematic for positive @xmath2 . ] for negative @xmath2 , in which case dropping it from the self - consistent but nonperturbative schwinger - dyson equations is not entirely absurd in the asymptotic limit .",
    "specifically , let us contemplate the situation where one the fields , say @xmath9 , remains undressed ( some sort of quenched approximation in which closed @xmath10-loop graphs are disregarded , signifying that induced multisigma interactions can be dropped ) .",
    "thus its corresponding @xmath37 , so the scaling of @xmath28 just becomes tied to the asymptotic behaviour of the field @xmath10 : they are inverse to one another .",
    "this connection is unsurprising especially in qed where the ward identity @xmath38 at zero photon momentum , already indicates that the scaling properties of the charged field and the soft vertex are intimately tied ( ` @xmath39 ' in a perturbative context ) . in section 2",
    "we summarize what is known about the vertex function in @xmath40 and yukawa theory , the two models upon which we focus .",
    "there we look for a nonperturbative version of @xmath28 which reduces to first order perturbation theory , _ with the correct singularities_. then in section 3 we show how this can be used to determine the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath17 even in the simplest kind of truncation encompassing the chain and rainbow summations with various model vertex functions .",
    "one of the most elementary exercises in quantum field theory is to work out the first order corrections to the propagator and vertex part , where we normally encounter infinities that must be renormalized .",
    "working in 2@xmath41 dimensions ( for isolating the infinities ) leads one to the typical expressions for the self - energy @xmath42 and proper vertex correction @xmath43 , @xmath44^{2-\\ell}}\\ ] ] @xmath45^{3-\\ell}},\\ ] ] where @xmath46 or 3 in the integer limit and @xmath47 are symmetry factors including @xmath48 .",
    "subtraction of the pole terms by renormalization constants produces logarithms of the denominators of each of the right hand sides , normalized at some mass scale @xmath49 , which is how dimensional transmutation and the renormalization prescription enters",
    ". one can recognize the resulting expressions as the first terms of an expansion  which strictly makes sense at a zero of the beta - function when we proceed to the nonperturbative regime  of the green functions in powers of @xmath17 ; for example for the massless two - point function , where the logarithmic term is easily computed , we end up straightforwardly with @xmath50 in keeping with @xmath51 . for the three - point function ,",
    "renormalized at zero @xmath9 momentum , the logarithm is actually a dilogarithm , being given by the integral @xmath52\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whose singularities characterize the ` triangle ' graph .",
    "it simplifies to pure logarithms when @xmath53 , being proportional to @xmath54,\\ ] ] which one should note is the order @xmath2 term of the expression @xmath55.\\ ] ] this bears an uncanny resemblance to the ratio @xmath56/(p_2 ^ 2-p_1 ^ 2)$ ] that one encounters when `` solving '' for the longitudinal 3-point vertex in gauge theories ; we ll come back to this point presently . in any case",
    "it strongly suggests that the nonperturbative form of the vertex possessing triangular topology exponentiates to @xmath57^{\\gamma_\\gamma},\\ ] ] where the ( symmetric in @xmath58 ) spectral function @xmath59 equals 1 up to first order in @xmath17 and @xmath60 .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to such topology , neglect the dressing of @xmath9 and reinsert ( 4 ) into ( 1 ) , this will produce a self - consistent equation for @xmath61 in terms of @xmath17 , as we already know that uniform scaling of @xmath27 requires @xmath62 when @xmath9 is quenched .",
    "the feynman parametric form of @xmath43 in the limit as @xmath63 , ( but _ not _",
    "@xmath64 ) is very suggestive of another lehmann - like representation which one encounters in the gauge technique . thus by changing variable to @xmath65 in the self - energy , one may convert from feynman to dispersive form : @xmath66 in the particular case that @xmath67 for the vertex function , which is often true , one can make a similar conversion in @xmath43 as @xmath53 : @xmath68^{3-\\ell}}\\ ] ] @xmath69,\\ ] ] @xmath70 thus we anticipate that the vertex possesses a simplified dispersive - like representation when one of the momenta is lightlike , and this property might prove rather useful .",
    "further progress may need additional truncation of the skeleton expansion and other practical simplifications .",
    "these remarks apply to all theories with basic trilinear interactions . before looking at nonperturbative aspects of the models @xmath71 and @xmath72 ,",
    "let us first note the order @xmath17 results for @xmath73 since they supply helpful weak - coupling limits for the two and three point functions involving massless fields @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    in @xmath76",
    "one trivially finds that @xmath77 where the limit @xmath78 must be taken .",
    "renormalizing at @xmath79 , one ends up with @xmath80 likewise the vertex correction is just expression ( 4 ) , with @xmath81 .",
    "it may be expressed @xcite as an appell function , but better still , it can be converted into a symmetrical sum of three hypergeometric functions in arbitrary dimensions @xcite ; we will utilise this presently .    turning to @xmath72 theory ,",
    "the inverse renormalized @xmath75 propagator to that order reads , @xmath82,\\ ] ] while the fully off - shell proper vertex part correction is given by @xmath83)\\gamma_5,\\ ] ] where , of the two scalar functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 , only the former carries the ultraviolet divergence .",
    "( a massive theory , apart from modifying @xmath84 and @xmath85 , would have led to further terms like @xmath86\\gamma_5 $ ] . )",
    "one readily finds that @xmath87\\ ] ] and @xmath88\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to be taken in the limit @xmath89 . in eq .",
    "( 10 ) , @xmath18 is nothing but the kllen function , namely @xmath90=p^4+p'^4+(p - p')^4 - 2p^2p'^2 - 2p^2(p - p')^2   -2p'^2(p - p')^2.\\ ] ] it is interesting to look at the case @xmath91 in ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) before worrying about renormalization ; one gets @xmath92}{p'^2-p^2 }   \\left(\\frac{1}{(p'+k)^2}-\\frac{1}{(p+k)^2}\\right)\\right]\\gamma_5.\\ ] ] again we notice the structure @xmath93 in the finite part , even though we are not dealing with a gauge theory . anyhow , renormalizing so that @xmath94 for @xmath79 , the finite @xmath85-type term remains unaffected , and we are left with the lightlike limit @xmath95 \\right]\\gamma_5.\\ ] ] our aim is to identify these expressions as first order in @xmath17 parts of some nonperturbative construct , so as to capture at the very least the triangular topology of the full vertex function , and then see how far we can take it from there .      let us start by reducing the perturbative vertex to a more manageable form .",
    "the first order expression for @xmath96 involves hypergeometric functions of two variables when the dimension and masses are arbitrary .",
    "however it can be simplified for @xmath97 in a very elegant way and davydychev @xcite has shown the way to do this : draw three lengths of size @xmath98 and let @xmath99 if a euclidean triangle can be drawn with those sides , 0 otherwise . then @xmath100 is four times the square of the area of such a triangle .",
    "the internal angles @xmath101 of the triangle are given in an obvious notation by @xmath102 , etc .",
    "and of course @xmath103 .",
    "the result for @xmath104,\\ ] ] which leads to the hypergeometric answer , @xmath105\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] can be converted into the beautiful form , @xmath106.\\ ] ] another useful expression ( in that limits can be taken more easily ) is obtained by adopting an integral representation of the hypergeometric functions ; thus @xmath107\\!.\\ ] ] davydychev has gone further and expressed @xmath43 as a series in @xmath108 leading to polylog functions ls@xmath109 , but we shall not require that expansion .",
    "note that the residue at @xmath110 of eq.(12 ) or ( 13 ) vanishes ( as it must since the vertex is convergent in 4-d ) , and that the residue in 6-d at @xmath111 reduces to @xmath112 , because of the identity , @xmath113 another interesting situation arises when @xmath114 , whereupon @xmath115 .",
    "thus @xmath116}{[p'^2-p^2]},\\ ] ] which allows one to take the limit @xmath117 , namely @xmath118 as @xmath78 .",
    "we now suggest a way of  going nonperturbative \" , which captures the essence of the vertex triangular topology .",
    "we firstly observe that the asymptotic form of the inverse propagator @xmath119 can be gotten directly from the self - energy @xmath120 in @xmath121 dimensions simply be making the replacement @xmath122 in the dimensionally continued result , apart from an overall factor that must be carefully chosen to accord with the renormalization condition .",
    "this procedure will lead from ( 6 ) to @xmath123 with @xmath124 to first order .    applying the same procedure to the @xmath125 vertex",
    ", we will end up with @xmath126,\\ ] ] where @xmath127 to first order . realising that @xmath128 and @xmath129 we can readily establish that @xmath130 when @xmath131 . also one may check that an expansion of ( 15 ) to order @xmath17 reproduces perturbation theory , including terms like @xmath132 which appear after renormalization .",
    "thus we are emboldened to regard ( 15 ) as a decent nonperturbative vertex that incorporates triangular topological contributions , but whether we can easily make use of it is entirely another matter since its form is analytically complicated .",
    "perhaps a more amenable form of ( 15 ) is @xmath133,\\ ] ] because , without too much trouble , it allows us to take the lightlike limit , @xmath134\\!,\\ ] ] a result which we foresaw earlier .",
    "the special limit when one leg carries zero momentum , @xmath135 is then readily found .",
    "also the renormalized perturbative answer stated at the end of the last subsection falls out upon expansion to first order in @xmath136 , provided the anomalous dimension is correctly identified .",
    "let us perform a similar procedure on @xmath137 . here",

    ", it is very easy to handle the propagator ( 7 ) and arrive at @xmath140 also it is possible to exponentiate the ( renormalized ) self - energy like terms in the vertex parts @xmath84 and @xmath85 arising in eqs ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) : @xmath141 on the other hand the full triangular topology integral ( 12 ) or ( 13 ) will produces a _ finite _ result @xmath142 .\\ ] ] one may verify that the vertex scaling behaviour is reproduced in @xmath143 and that it vanishes for @xmath144 , as it should in zeroth order .",
    "anyhow , combining the terms , we arrive at the nonperturbative yukawa vertex parts , @xmath145 @xmath146                    + ( p - p')^2\\gamma_{fb},\\ ] ] where @xmath147\\gamma_f   + 2(-(p - p')^2/\\mu^2)^{\\gamma_\\gamma}-(-p^2/\\mu^2)^{\\gamma_\\gamma }   - ( -p'^2/\\mu^2)^{\\gamma_\\gamma}$ ] .",
    "the question is how to apply all this .",
    "one s first inclination is to substitute the vertex ( 15 ) or ( 16 ) into ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) so as to find the relation between anomalous dimension and coupling constant  a relation which is normally found by a tedious process of perturbative renormalization and is worked out to order @xmath148 at least .",
    "our proposal is that nonperturbative forms of propagator and vertex avoid the need for renormalization since the skeleton expansion is automatically regularized at the physical dimension @xmath149 or 6 ; as we shall see , such a procedure will lead to a transcendental relation between @xmath2 and @xmath17 .",
    "this happens even when one truncates to the first contribution to the self - energy , having the form @xmath150 although one ought properly to consider the entire series of skeleton terms with their ever more intricated topologies ( and matching vertices ) .",
    "nonetheless , considering even the first term of the skeleton series is a substantial improvement on past efforts @xcite and is worthy of study .",
    "the task of evaluating the first term @xmath151 is rather daunting : one is required to integrate the product of two dressed propagators with the _ square _ of expression ( 15 ) or expression ( 16 ) , and this is technically very demanding .",
    "numerical calculations are useless from that viewpoint because one is interested in obtaining the analytical connection between @xmath2 and @xmath17 , even if comparison with perturbation theory eventually necessitates a power series expansion in @xmath17 . a number of helpful auxiliary integrals are collected in the appendix , but we are forced to admit that the full - blown integration producing @xmath152 is presently beyond our technical reach . _ faute de mieux _ we are forced to approximate the skeleton feynman integral by one which is doable and which captures the essence of the idea : the main thing is to ensure that the non - perturbative vertex has the correct scaling behaviour , symmetry properties and analytic behaviour as far as possible , and that it should by itself regularize the intermediate momentum integral .    in the following",
    "we shall attempt to use a few approximations to the nonperturbative triangular vertex that reflect its main features , in order to extract the relation between anomalous dimension and coupling constant .",
    "thus we will examine a number of models in which @xmath152 is free of infinities and is automatically regularized  it all too easy to construct models which have the correct scaling property but which nevertheless contain infinities  but where the vertex singularities are not quite correct .      here",
    "we make the choice @xmath153 and leave the @xmath9 propagator undressed .",
    "this has the virtue of simplicity ; it possesses symmetry at the @xmath10 legs and correct scaling but is otherwise awry in its analytical properties and especially its vertex singularities . ignoring these defects , and using the results in the appendix",
    ", we obtain the self - consistency relation @xmath154 or @xmath155 this may be contrasted with the rainbow approximation where the self - consistency relation instead reads , @xmath156 to obtain a perturbative expansion of ( 21 ) we take a series in @xmath2 or @xmath157 as needed to arrive at @xmath158 compared with @xcite @xmath159      we now consider a vertex which better captures the analytical behaviour of the triangular topology but which is necessarily more complicated than the previous model . here",
    "we try to mimic some of the dependence on @xmath160 which arises in ( 11 ) by letting @xmath161/\\delta_e.\\ ] ] making use of the equations in the appendix , we may arrive at the self - consistency relation , @xmath162    \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\frac{a}{6}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\gamma}+\\frac{11}{6}+\\frac{41\\gamma}{36 }   + \\cdots \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this corresponds to the series @xmath163      before making any approximations , we may note that the @xmath152 contribution to the inverse fermion propagator @xmath165 , with @xmath166)\\gamma_5\\ ] ] can be written as @xmath167.\\ ] ] therefore , if we use a quenched @xmath9 approximation , the @xmath152 term leads to the following self - consistent relation for the anomalous dimension , @xmath168\\ ] ] into which we may feed various models for the vertex parts @xmath169 .",
    "of course we would dearly have loved to make use of their nonperturbative forms given in the previous section ( consistent with triangular topology ) but find the resulting computation too hard analytically ; so we are obliged to model something resembling the true vertex that is within our capabilities .",

    "let us therefore make the approximation @xmath174 in quenched @xmath125 theory , since we have already disregarded the @xmath9 field dressing . using the usual spectral form of the @xmath10 field propagator , we may therefore substitute @xmath175 in the schwinger - dyson equation , @xmath176 recalling that @xmath177 , the spectral equation reduces to @xmath178 where @xmath179 $ ] is the first order self - energy for a @xmath10 field of mass @xmath180 , to be taken in the limit as @xmath78 .",
    "this has essentially the same form as in the gauge technique @xcite for qed , except that it is no longer true that @xmath181  and this is just what one needs !",

    "all the above model conclusions should be treated with great caution and some scepticism .",
    "we supplied models of the true vertex whose scaling coincided to second order with known results for the anomalous dimension , but which possessed incorrect singularities .",
