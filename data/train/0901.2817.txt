    "the eis dataset comprises of three 256@xmath0 256spectroheliogram `` raster '' observations ( 19:20 - 21:34ut , 01:15 - 03:30 , 04:10 - 06:24ut ) in multiple spectral windows , targeted at the following edge of noaa  ar  10930 .",
    "the spectra belonging to the fe  xiii 202.04 and fe  xv 284.16 lines are fitted and the non - thermal line widths ( hereafter @xmath1 ) are determined using the formalism of swm2009 .",
    "in addition , the active region complex was continuously monitored by the focal plane package over the course of the event . the broadband filter imager ( bfi ) alternately observed ca  iih ( 3968 ) and g - band ( 4305 ) from 12/14/2006 19:13 - 12/15/2008 15:58ut with a spatial scale of 0.11 at a cadence ranging from 3  seconds to 5  minutes , but with most frames taken at a 2 minute cadence .",
    "the narrowband filter imager ( nfi ) took shuttered stokes i & v measurements at -172m from line center of the fe  i 6302.5 with a mean cadence of 2  minutes and a spatial scale of 0.16 .",
    "figure  f1 shows the three phases of the coronal dimming observed in the intensity and @xmath1 of the fe  xiii 202.04 ( left ) and fe  xv 284.16 ( right ) emission lines . in each case",
    "panels a through c show the line intensity before , at the peak and near the end of the dimming event , panels d through f show the percentage change in intensity between panels a and b , c and a and , c and b respectively .",
    "panels g through i show @xmath1 before , at the peak and near the end of the dimming event while panels j through l show the percentage change in @xmath1 between panels h and g , i and g , and , i and h. the solid white contours in panels d and e and the black contours in panels h , i , j and k indicate a 75% reduction in the fe  xii 195.12 line intensity ( swm2009 ) . like the former analysis",
    "we see a large ( @xmath215% ) increase in @xmath1 that is concentrated in and around the perimeter of the 75% intensity reduction contour . as the dimming event progresses",
    "( comparing panels c , a and e ) , there continue to be regions of difference in @xmath1 late in the lifetime of the dimming , becoming more spatially compact and following the contraction of the intensity decrease contour . in panel f",
    ", we see that @xmath1 appears to be slowly recovering to pre - eruption levels .",
    "close inspection of the movies associated with fig .",
    "f2 show that something quite unexpected has happened to the southern portion of the active region during the dimming event .",
    "in the region around position 670 , -120(marked with diamonds in all figures ) between 22:37ut and 22:44ut the dim penumbra - like emission that we would have commonly associated with cool plasma lying on nearly horizontal magnetic fields completely disappears .",
    "this change is most clearly visible in the g - band images , but mirrored in those of ca  ii .",
    "the penumbral emission disappears as the post - flare / cme brightenings / ribbons move southward over that region .",
    "@xcite indicate that these ribbons are associated with the changing morphology of the magnetic field lines over the active region as the cme lifts off .",
    "interestingly , in panels b and d of fig .",
    "f1 , we see that this location shows a significant increase in @xmath1 over the pre - event values that is almost immediately followed by a significant reversal .",
    "unfortunately , there is not enough space in this short article for a detailed discussion of this point or the sot spectro - polarimeter observed the vector field in the vicinity of the active region complex before ( 12/14/2006 22:00 - 23:03ut ) , and after ( 12/15/2006 05:45 - 06:48ut ) the dimming ( see online folder for a graphic of the sp observations ) .    comparing the inverted sp observations @xcite of the active region is not straightforward ( a considerable amount of time , and subsequent small - scale evolution has occurred between the sp rasters - see , e.g. , the movie of fig .",
    "f2 ) . there has been a considerable flux cancellation and decrease of field inclination in the region around ( 680 , -120 ) leaving a weaker , predominantly positive , polarity mean field .",
    "these factors would contribute to the apparent disappearance of the penumbral emission .",
    "a significantly more detailed investigation of the small - scale evolution and resulting global magnetic topology changes is required to address this issue .",
    "however , we should consider if the change in magnetic topology was instigated by the cme ( tied to the dimming ) or if it simply related to the gross restructuring of this very complex active region in its effort to find a lower energy state after the eruption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the spectral information presented reinforces the conclusion of swm2009 that the changes of the coronal non - thermal line widths are tied to the thermodynamic evolution of the dimming region - and are consistent with the growth and recovery of alfvn wave amplitudes in the varying magnetic topology . again",
    ", we emphasize that , as temporally open magnetic regions , coronal dimmings must be temporary sources of the fast solar wind as the values of @xmath1 reached are equivalent to those observed in coronal holes @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen what impact that fast wind stream , and it s momentum , will have on the cme itself . clearly , including the rapid thermodynamic variation of the coronal plasma ( neglecting changes observed deeper in the atmosphere , sect .",
    "suck ) make the understanding of a cme ( an intrinsically self - consistent eruption affecting all of the atmospheric layers ) much more complex than is currently considered ."
