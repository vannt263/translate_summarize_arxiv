    "mapping how the ratio of luminous to dark matter in a galaxy changes as a function of radius provides an important test for galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "numerical simulations of halo formation in a cosmological context have reached a level where they can predict the radial profile of an isolated dark halo ( navarro 1996 , hereafter nfw ; cole & lacey 1996 ) .",
    "this profile is altered by the presence of dissipative , baryonic matter , which collects at the center and contracts the dark matter profile .",
    "this contraction may provide a natural explanation for the observed fact that the circular velocity is approximately constant with radius in spiral galaxies ( blumenthal 1986 ; nfw ) .",
    "elliptical galaxies are more centrally concentrated than spiral galaxies of the same mass , suggesting that they may have circular velocities that are higher in the inner parts than in the outer parts .",
    "observational studies of the dark halos in spiral galaxies ( e.g. , van albada 1985 ) are comparably straightforward .",
    "hi gas provides an excellent tracer to large radii . to interpret the kinematics it is justifiable to assume a nearly co - planar distribution with nearly circular orbits , upon which the gravitational potential can be constrained from the observables .",
    "by contrast , the majority of elliptical galaxies do not have hi disks that are in equilibrium , and the transition from where the stellar mass dominates to where the dark halo dominates has remained poorly constrained .",
    "this has been due to the difficulties in obtaining unambiguous results from the stellar kinematics , as caused by two main problems .",
    "first , modeling the stellar dynamics for ellipticals is much more complex than for the cold disks of spirals ( de  zeeuw & franx 1991 ; bertin & stiavelli 1993 ; de zeeuw 1996 ) .",
    "random motions dominate , and the stars can occupy a host of qualitatively different orbits in any given potential . hence , the dynamical modeling must solve for _ both _ the potential _ and _ the orbital distribution of the stars , given the observed projected positions and velocities of stars . in practice , most existing studies have not done this . instead , the orbital structure has often been assumed a priori , by requiring that the distribution function ( hereafter , df ; i.e. , the number of stars per unit volume of the phase space of stellar positions and velocities ) has a certain simple form . the second reason for the poor understanding of the star ",
    "halo connection in ellipticals has been the fact that until recently good stellar kinematic data were available only out to approximately one effective radius @xmath10 .",
    "this left more than half the stellar mass kinematically unconstrained .",
    "in addition , the data were generally restricted to measurements of the two lowest order velocity moments , i.e. , the mean streaming velocity @xmath11 and the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath12 .",
    "these quantities contain no or little independent information on the intrinsic velocity dispersion anisotropy of the system ( binney & mamon 1982 ) , which provides the main indeterminacy in the modeling . as a consequence ,",
    "stellar dynamical indications for the presence of dark halos around elliptical galaxies have remained ambiguous .",
    "there have been indications for dark halos in studies that employed restricted classes of dynamical models ( e.g. , van der marel 1991 ; saglia 1992 ) .",
    "however , the few models in the literature that had the full freedom of rearranging orbits ( e.g. , richstone & tremaine 1984 ; dejonghe 1989 ) have been able to fit the data for most ellipticals without requiring any dark matter ( katz & richstone 1985 ; saglia 1993 ; bertin 1994 ) .",
    "discrete kinematical tracers in elliptical galaxies ( i.e. , planetary nebulae and globular clusters ) have the advantage that they can be observed to larger radii , but they have the disadvantage of small - number statistics",
    ". dynamical modeling of their observed radial velocities is beset by the same degeneracies that plague the interpretation of the integrated light measurements .",
    "not surprisingly , these studies have produced similarly ambiguous results ( ciardullo , jacoby & dejonghe 1993 ; tremblay , merritt & williams 1995 ) . yet , as summarized in various reviews ( e.g. , ashman 1992 ; de zeeuw 1995 ; saglia 1996 ) , there is independent evidence for extended dark matter from x - ray measurements of luminous galaxies ( forman , jones & tucker 1985 ; awaki et al .",
    "1994 ) , from hi kinematics ( franx 1994 ) , and from gravitational lensing ( maoz & rix 1993 ; kochanek 1995 ) .",
    "it is likely that this apparent discrepancy is attributable to the shortcomings of the stellar dynamical tests , i.e. , to the uncertainty about the orbital distributions resulting from insufficiently constraining data .",
    "there are several reasons for being optimistic that this situation can be improved and that the luminous to dark matter distribution in elliptical galaxies can now be investigated in some detail through stellar dynamical studies .",
    "first , improved ccd technology ( larger detector size , higher qe , lower read - out noise and dark current ) , combined with improved strategies to ensure accurate sky subtraction and better stellar template matching , have made it possible to obtain stellar kinematics to 24 @xmath10 ( carollo 1995 , hereafter c95 ; statler 1996 ) . with data reaching out to these radii",
    ", kinematic constraints can be obtained over most of the stellar body .",
    "second , improved analysis techniques ( e.g. , rix & white 1992 ; van  der  marel & franx 1993 , hereafter vdmf ; kuijken & merrifield 1993 ) make it possible now to extract the entire line - of - sight velocity profile ( vp ) from the absorption - line spectra , rather than only its lowest order moments @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ". the higher moments of the vp , which can now be measured , contain essential information about the anisotropy of the velocity distribution ( dejonghe , 1987 ; gerhard 1993 ; c95 ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to describe the development and application of theoretical tools that permit to model and fit vp shape data in a flexible and objective way . in its most general form",
    "the modeling technique presented here can answer the question : given a variety of gravitational potentials and given a set of observational constraints ( photometry and kinematics , including vps ) , what is the relative likelihood of the different potentials ? for each potential the orbital distribution is determined that best fits the data , and the likelihood follows from the quality of the fit .",
    "thus the method allows one to determine which are the best - fitting potentials , and which potentials are excluded by the data .",
    "our technique is based on the numerical calculation of a representative library of orbits in a chosen potential , and the subsequent determination of the non - negative superposition of these orbits that best fits the data .",
    "this approach was pioneered by schwarzschild ( 1979 ) , who required the orbit superposition to reproduce the galaxy density , and so built triaxial galaxy models .",
    "richstone ( 1980 ; 1984 ) built scale  free axisymmetric models with this technique . in the past decade , the approach has been used to build a variety of spherical , axisymmetric and triaxial galaxy models , which also include the observed radial velocities and/or velocity dispersions as constraints ( e.g. , pfenniger 1984 ; richstone & tremaine 1984 , 1985 , 1988 ; levison & richstone 1985 ; zhao 1996 ) .",
    "we have built on this previous work by adding two new features : ( i ) we calculate and compare an arbitrary number of moments of the gauss - hermite series expansion of the vp , and show how they can be used as linear constraints on the model ; and ( ii ) we take into account the error on each observational constraint in the superposition procedure and hence obtain an objective measure for the quality - of - fit . only projected , observable quantities are included in the fit .",
    "we include a proper seeing convolution of each orbit , so that the observational setup of the data ( including aperture binning ) can be accurately taken into account .",
    "the addition of vp modeling not only allows us to interpret the vp shape data that is now becoming available , but it also removes the need for additional simplifications and assumptions . we do not have to assume that the true lowest order velocity moments of the models can be compared without bias to the best gaussian fits @xmath11 and @xmath12 obtained from the data",
    "this was done in previous implementations , and is also implicit in modeling based on the jeans equations ( e.g. , merritt & oh 1997 ) .",
    "avoiding this assumption removes the possibility of systematic errors ( easily 1020% ; vdmf ) in the interpretation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we also do not assume that the local velocity distributions are gaussian everywhere along the line - of - sight .",
    "our extension of schwarzschild s method is valid for any geometry . to illustrate and test the new elements in the most straightforward way",
    ", we restrict ourselves here to the spherical case , which simplifies the calculation of the stellar orbits .",
    "the treatment of the vp shapes and of the orbital superposition is fully general .",
    "we test the method on analytic models , and then apply it to the kinematic measurements for the e0 galaxy ngc 2434 obtained by c95 ; preliminary results from this analysis are published in rix ( 1996a , b ) .",
    "the extension of our scheme to axisymmetric systems is described in cretton ( 1997 ) and applied in van  der  marel ( 1997a , b ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe the modeling procedure . in section  3",
    "we test the method on isotropic hernquist models , and in section  4 we use it to study the presence and properties of a dark halo around the e0 galaxy ngc  2434 . in the analysis we use a family of cosmologically motivated galaxy potentials that is discussed in appendix  b. we summarize our results in section  5 .",
    "our extension of schwarzschild s method tests in three steps whether a given potential is compatible with all observational data :    1 .",
    "a representative library of orbits is calculated in the chosen potential .",
    "each orbit is projected onto the space of observables .",
    "the combination of orbits with non - negative occupation numbers is found that best matches the data , taking into account the observational errors .    for computational convenience , we here carry out steps 1 and 2 for spherical geometry .",
    "our description of step 3 is fully general .",
    "other techniques to constrain the potentials of spherical stellar systems through modeling of observed vp shapes are available ( e.g. , dejonghe & merritt 1992 ; merritt 1993a ; merritt & saha 1993 ) , but these do require the availability of analytic integrals of motion .",
    "our approach has the advantage that it can be generalized to more complicated geometries in a straightforward manner .      in a spherical gravitational potential @xmath13 ,",
    "all orbits are planar rosettes , characterized by four isolating integrals of motion : the energy @xmath14 , and the three components of the angular momentum @xmath15 . for each energy",
    ", @xmath16 lies in the interval @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is the angular momentum for the circular orbit at energy @xmath14 .",
    "this circular orbit has a radius @xmath19 , given by the implicit equation @xmath20_{r=\\rc } = e.\\ ] ] to cover phase space , we choose a grid in the @xmath21 plane ( the lindblad diagram ) in the following way .",
    "we specify a set of radii @xmath22 , @xmath23 , which are spaced logarithmically at small radii ( corresponding to observed radii @xmath24 ) and linearly at large radii with @xmath25 ( the typical resolution of the observational constraints ) .",
    "each radius @xmath26 defines an energy grid point @xmath27 , with an associated @xmath28 . for each of the @xmath29 grid points @xmath27",
    ", we choose @xmath30 angular momenta @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the numbers @xmath33 are distributed uniformly in the interval @xmath34 $ ] , with @xmath35 .",
    "this choice of @xmath36 excludes the exactly radial and circular orbits , which avoids numerical difficulties in the radial orbit calculation for singular potentials , and avoids the sharp edges in the projected density and vp of a circular orbit .",
    "typically we set @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the orbits in a spherical model need only be integrated in the radial dimension , which provides the instantaneous radius @xmath39 and radial velocity @xmath40 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the tangential velocity @xmath41 follows from @xmath42 .",
    "each orbit is started at its apocenter , and is calculated for an integral number of periods .",
    "for a spherical potential one half of a period is in principle sufficient , but calculating a small number of complete periods ( @xmath43 ) reduces discreteness effects in the result , arising from the finite number of time - steps .",
    "we chose approximately 300 time steps per radial period . during the integration",
    "the time steps were adjusted to conserve energy equally well at each step . for every orbit the fractional energy conservation was at least @xmath44 over the whole integration .",
    "our orbit integrations are carried out with a simple predictor - corrector integrator , because the orbits need not be computed with great accuracy .",
    "if , for example , the orbit were to drift in energy by a small amount during the integration , the orbit would no longer represent a @xmath45-function in phase space , but a short line or small area in the @xmath21 plane .",
    "but since the ( presumably ) continuous df is represented by a finite number of discrete orbits ( or ` basis vectors ' ) , there is no reason to prefer true @xmath45-functions over ` fuzzy ' ones .",
    "also , physical meaning can not be attached to rapid fluctuations of the phase space density , given realistically available constraints .",
    "indeed , we have found it advantageous to assemble each orbit @xmath46 from a number of ` sub - orbits ' , typically about 25 , whose integrals of motion are drawn at random from a small phase space cube @xmath47 around @xmath48 ( see also zhao 1996 ) .",
    "this reduces sharp edges in the projected density and vp ( especially for nearly circular orbits ) .",
    "it also relieves memory requirements by reducing the number of orbits that must be stored .    for testing and debugging the algorithms it proved useful to construct smoother building blocks , @xmath49_components",
    "_ , in addition to the @xmath21_orbits_. they can be viewed as a weighted combination of orbits with different @xmath50 , but the same @xmath14 .",
    "they can be constructed almost analytically for any spherical potential , as described in appendix  a. these components can be used to build isotropic models with @xmath51 .",
    "such models provide a useful test case , because their projected properties can often be calculated analytically . for axisymmetric models , @xmath52components ( with @xmath53 along the symmetry axis ) prove to be similarly useful ( cretton 1997 ) .",
    "we adopt a cartesian coordinate system @xmath54 , with the @xmath53-axis directed towards the observer .",
    "the associated cylindrical and polar coordinate systems are denoted @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this makes @xmath57 the projected radius in the @xmath58 plane of the sky .",
    "the tangential velocity @xmath41 satisfies @xmath59 .",
    "an angle @xmath60 defines @xmath61 and @xmath62 in terms of @xmath41 , through @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    as",
    "an orbit is integrated , it is projected onto the space of the observables @xmath65 . in the following",
    ", we will refer to the line - of - sight velocity @xmath66 as @xmath67 . to store the projected orbital properties we adopt a grid ( i.e. , a storage cube ) in the @xmath68-space .",
    "the spatial coordinate spacing is matched to the pixel grid of the photometric or spectroscopic observations ( @xmath69 for ground - based data ) .",
    "the velocity coordinate should cover in principle @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "we found in practice that 30 - 50 velocity bins covering the range @xmath71 $ ] is sufficient , where @xmath72 is the largest observed velocity dispersion .",
    "the orbit integration yields only the phase - space coordinates @xmath73 at each time step .",
    "however , for projection onto the space of the observables , all six phase - space coordinates are required .",
    "these are obtained by drawing a random viewing angle and a random direction of the tangential velocity vector at each time step , i.e. , we draw @xmath74 $ ] , @xmath75 $ ] and @xmath76 $ ] from uniform distributions .",
    "this yields the following observables at the given time step : @xmath77 this procedure properly takes into account the fact that the storage cube should contain the average contribution of _ all _ trajectories that correspond to the given @xmath78 ( i.e. , it ensures that the models have dfs that depend only on the modulus of @xmath79 , and not on its direction ) .",
    "the procedure may be repeated numerous times at each time step , to obtain several different @xmath68 for the same @xmath73 .",
    "this corresponds to viewing the model from all geometrically equivalent angles at a fixed time , and creates a smoother projection .",
    "we denote the different orbits in the library ( each corresponding to a fixed combination @xmath78 ) with the index @xmath80 , with @xmath81 .",
    "the total number of orbits @xmath82 . the _ occupation weight _ of orbit @xmath80 on the storage cube cell centered on @xmath68 is denoted as @xmath83 . at the start of the integration of each orbit , the weights are set to zero .",
    "as the integration of the trajectory proceeds , and projected coordinates are obtained as described above , a weight is added to the cube cell that contains the projected coordinates .",
    "this weight is chosen equal to the average of the sizes of the previous and the next time - step in the integration .",
    "this assignment of weights is effectively a monte - carlo integration of the orbit over the grid , because the chance of dropping a weight in a grid cell is proportional to the time the orbit spends in it .",
    "once the orbit calculation ( and projections ) are finished , the occupation weights for each orbit are normalized to unit mass , @xmath84 sometimes projected quantities extend beyond the boundaries of the storage cube . in this case",
    "no weights are added to the grid , but the time spent outside the cube is used in the normalization .",
    "figure  1 illustrates the occupation weights for four orbits in a test model , all with the same energy @xmath14 but with different angular momenta @xmath85 . because of the spherical symmetry of the system",
    ", the weights can be conveniently displayed in the two - dimensional space of projected radius @xmath57 and line - of - sight velocity @xmath67 storage cube in our technique is motivated by the fact that realistic observational setups generally do not have circular symmetry on the sky .",
    "it also makes the generalization to axisymmetric systems simple . in axisymmetric or triaxial",
    "potentials the orbit integration proceeds differently , but after projection , the fitting of the observational constraints through orbit superposition is identical . ] .",
    "the differences in the appearance of the orbits in this space of observables is evident .",
    "it is important for model predictions to incorporate the observational setup and to account for the point - spread - function ( psf ) of the data .",
    "the final model is a linear super - position of orbits and the psf convolution of an orbit is also a linear operation .",
    "therefore , the two operations commute and the psf convolution can be carried out separately for each orbit .",
    "the psf does not correlate velocities and hence is carried out separately for each velocity slice of the storage cube .",
    "each velocity slice is an ` iso - velocity ' image of the orbit on a cartesian grid .",
    "hence , the psf convolution is most efficiently carried out by a fast fourier transform of these iso - velocity images . as many orbits , the tightly bound ones ,",
    "only occupy a small fraction of the spatial grid , the size @xmath86 of the fft grid can be adjusted for each orbit and each slice , resulting in a considerable speed - up .",
    "the storage - grid must extend a few psf widths beyond the outermost observational data points .",
    "this psf convolution is most important for studying the dynamics at small radii if steep kinematic gradients are present , in the application of our technique to the search for massive nuclear black holes .",
    "after the @xmath80-th orbit has been calculated , projected onto the storage cube and convolved with the psf , we need to extract quantities for direct comparison with the observational constraints .",
    "the data contain information on the projected properties of the galaxy at a select number of _ constraint positions _ on the projected face of the galaxy .",
    "photometry is generally available over the whole face of the galaxy , extending to much larger radii than the kinematic measurements .",
    "so in general , there are different constraint positions for the photometric and the kinematic data .",
    "in addition , the constraint positions are often extended areas ( the width of a spectroscopic slit multiplied by the number of pixels along the slit that were averaged to obtain spectra of sufficient s / n ) .",
    "clearly , the storage cube must be chosen sufficiently big to cover all constraint areas .",
    "the constraint positions are labeled by @xmath87 , with @xmath88 .",
    "we denote by @xmath89 the fraction of the area of the storage cube cell centered on the grid point @xmath58 , that is contained within the constraint area @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath90 be the fraction of the total mass on orbit @xmath80 that contributes to constraint area @xmath87 .",
    "this mass fraction is obtained by summing over the ( psf convolved ) storage cube for the given orbit : @xmath91 a dynamical model is determined by its _ orbital weights _",
    "@xmath92 , which measure the fraction of the total mass of the system that resides on each orbit @xmath80 ( see appendix  a.1 for details ) . the total mass fraction @xmath93 of the model that contributes to constraint area @xmath87",
    "is obtained as a sum over all orbits : @xmath94 to obtain the observed mass fractions @xmath95 at the constraint positions @xmath87 from the observed surface brightnesses @xmath96 , we assume that the _ stellar population _ has the same mass - to - light ratio everywhere in the galaxy .",
    "one then has @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the area of constraint position @xmath87 , and @xmath99 is the total observed luminosity .",
    "fitting the predicted mass fractions @xmath93 to the observed mass fractions @xmath95 is then a linear superposition problem for the @xmath92 .    for our technique to work",

    "the ` smoothness ' of the df in a collisionless system ultimately depends on the efficiency of the violent relaxation during the formation of the galaxy , which is difficult to quantify . here , we are mostly interested in constraints on the gravitational potential , independent of the detailed properties of the df , as long as it is non negative .",
    "therefore , we employ only a very simple smoothing procedure , which does not significantly impact the model fit to the data .",
    "smoothing of the df can be achieved through regularization ( press 1992 ) , but there is no unique approach ( merritt 1993b ) .",
    "previous authors have either maximized the entropy of phase space ( richstone & tremaine 1988 ) , or have enforced local smoothness of the distribution function ( merritt 1993a ; zhao 1996 ) .",
    "here we use a regularization scheme similar to that of zhao .",
    "it minimizes the local curvature of the mass distribution in phase space by including an additional term to the @xmath0-function defined in equation  ( [ chisq ] ) : @xmath151 the @xmath152 orbits @xmath153 are the ` immediate neighbors ' of orbit @xmath80 in phase space . for our simple @xmath78 grid",
    "there are four neighbors to each point that is not on the edge of the grid .",
    "the quantities @xmath154 are defined as @xmath155 , where the @xmath156 are a set of reference weights .",
    "these could be chosen to reflect any prior knowledge or prejudice about the df .",
    "for example , they may be set to the orbital weights that can be calculated semi - analytically ( appendix  a.1 ) for an isotropic df , forcing the model to tend to the isotropic df in the limit of infinite smoothing .",
    "here we have employed the simplest regularization by setting all the @xmath156 equal to unity .",
    "the parameter @xmath157 in equation  ( [ regul ] ) governs the degree of regularization .",
    "although this parameter is in principle freely adjustable , it can be chosen in a reasonably objective way , by letting the data determine the degree of permissible df smoothing .",
    "let @xmath158 be the minimum chi - squared for the case without regularization ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "any solution that matches the data with @xmath160 is statistically equally acceptable .",
    "we can therefore increase @xmath157 until @xmath161 , which yields a smoother df that provides an equally good fit to the data .",
    "this regularization procedure is followed in all the subsequent applications in this paper .",
    "as figure 5 shows , this minimal regularization often leads to drastically smoother dfs with indistinguishable fits to the data .",
    "given the simple nature of the regularization employed here , it is important to reiterate that there is a large class of problems for which regularization is not essential .",
    "for example , this is the case when the main goal is to rule out certain potentials , those without a dark halo or without a black hole .",
    "if no good fit can be found without regularization , i.e. , allowing arbitrarily un - smooth dfs , then there will certainly not exist a smooth df that fits the data .",
    "thus , by omitting regularization at all , one will always obtain conservative estimates of the range of potentials that are ruled out .",
    "as an illustration and a test , we create pseudo - data drawn from the analytically known properties of an isotropic ( @xmath49 ) non - rotating hernquist ( 1990 ) model .",
    "we assume a mass to light ratio @xmath162 for the stellar population ( in arbitrary units ) , and assume that no dark material is present .",
    "we match these pseudo - data with our technique , under the assumption of a mass - to - light ratio @xmath163 . as constraints we use the surface brightness over the radial range @xmath164 to @xmath165 , with an uncertainty of 5% , the line - of - sight velocity dispersion with an error of 5% , and the ( non - zero ) values of @xmath132 with an error of @xmath166 ( based on the observational characteristics of , c95 ) .",
    "we calculated a library of 420 orbits ( @xmath167 and @xmath168 ) , with the energy grid ranging from @xmath169 to @xmath170 .",
    "each orbit was built up from 25 sub - orbits ( see section  2.1 ) .",
    "only one orbit library was calculated , for @xmath171 . the orbit library for any other @xmath163 is obtained trivially by rescaling the model velocity by a factor @xmath172 .",
    "however , the orbit contributions @xmath115 to the gauss - hermite moments at each constraint position must be calculated separately for each assumed @xmath173 , because they involve the observed velocities @xmath112 and dispersions @xmath113 in a non - linear way .",
    "similarly , the nnls fit for the orbital weights @xmath92 must also be done separately for each @xmath173 .",
    "we constructed models with @xmath174 , @xmath175  and @xmath176 .",
    "this mimics the realistic situation in which the true mass - to - light ratio of a galaxy is unknown , and has to be inferred from models with different @xmath163 .",
    "figure  2 shows the match to the pseudo - data if only the surface brightness and the velocity dispersion profiles are fitted . for the correct mass - to - light ratio ( middle panels ) , the fit is perfect and the difference between input and output @xmath132 is negligible , even though @xmath132 was not fitted .",
    "note that @xmath177 regularization has been applied to all models .",
    "the bottom panel shows the orbital ( mass ) weights in a modified lindblad diagram , where @xmath14 and @xmath50 are replaced by @xmath178 and @xmath179 , respectively .",
    "the area of the dots is proportional to the logarithm of the orbital weight and the vertical dashed lines show the radial range in which observational constraints exist . for @xmath180 all",
    "the mass is attributed to orbits with @xmath19 within the observed range ( although of course for very radial orbits , @xmath181 , the apocenter lies well beyond @xmath19 ) .",
    "the model assigns comparable mass to orbits with the same energy but different eccentricities .",
    "this is reassuring , because the pseudo - data were drawn from an isotropic hernquist model .",
    "note that we have no reason to expect that our best fitting model is precisely isotropic , because we are constraining a function of two variables , @xmath182 , by two functions of one variable , the surface brightness and the velocity dispersion profile .",
    "this is insufficient to fix @xmath182 uniquely , but the computations show that the remaining freedom in the df is not large ( see also dejonghe 1987 ) .",
    "we verified that our method does reproduce the isotropic hernquist model exactly ( to within the small discretization errors ) when only the f(e ) components are used ( see section  2.1 and appendix  a ) .",
    "the panels on either side show the fit for potentials with assumed mass - to - light ratios of @xmath183 ( left ) and @xmath184 ( right ) . for @xmath183 ,",
    "the resulting distribution function consists of two disjoint pieces : a tangentially biased part at @xmath185 and a very radially biased part at @xmath186 .",
    "these parts conspire to increase the velocity dispersion in the observed range above the isotropic value .",
    "the circular orbits have their highest projected velocity dispersion at @xmath187 and the radial orbits have their highest projected dispersion at radii @xmath188 .",
    "the opposite effect is observed when @xmath189 : the orbit weights now are given to radially biased orbits at small radii and nearly circular orbits at very large radii .",
    "this combination leads to a projected dispersion smaller than the isotropic value . despite these discrepancies ,",
    "it is remarkable that over much of the radial range the velocity dispersion can be fit to much better than the factor of @xmath190 expected from simple scaling , owing to the freedom to select a special distribution of orbits .",
    "however , the predicted @xmath132 profiles for both @xmath191 and @xmath184 are significantly non - gaussian , due to the awkward phase - space structure ; they differ substantially from the input profile .",
    "figure  3 shows the same orbit library , but forced to fit to surface brightness , the velocity dispersion _ and _ the @xmath132 profile .",
    "not surprisingly , the model with @xmath192 remains virtually unchanged .",
    "for the other two models the match to @xmath193 is improved , at the slight expense of the @xmath194 fit .",
    "figure  4 shows the @xmath0 of the model fit as a function of @xmath163 .",
    "the dashed line shows the fit if only the surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles are used as constraints ( as in figure  2 ) .",
    "a range of potentials , those with @xmath195 , all match the data perfectly ( @xmath196 , because no noise was added to the pseudo - data ) .",
    "this is consistent with the results of binney & mamon ( 1982 ) ; in each potential the model uses a different orbital structure to fit the data .",
    "the solid line shows the @xmath0 when the @xmath132 profile is included in the fit ( as in figure  3 ) .",
    "the range of @xmath163 that produces @xmath197 is now much more narrowly centered on the true value , @xmath198 .",
    "many of the potentials that could fit the surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles can not simultaneously fit the @xmath132 profile .",
    "the vp shape information constrains the velocity anisotropy , and therefore helps in limiting the set of allowed potentials .",
    "figure  5 shows the effect of regularizing the orbital weight distribution , for the case in which the mass - to - light ratio is correctly assumed to be @xmath192 . the left panel shows the fit without any regularization",
    ": the resulting phase - space distribution is very jagged , and in fact very different from the isotropic model that was used to generate the pseudo - data .",
    "however , since all orbital weight distributions that yield fits within @xmath199 are a statistically equally good match to the data , we are at liberty to select the smoothest distribution function amongst those ( middle panel ) .",
    "this model is indeed very close to the isotropic model .",
    "the right panel shows excessive regularization , resulting in @xmath200 . in the latter case",
    "one sees that the fit to the data deteriorates if too smooth an orbital weight distribution is enforced .",
    "the modeling technique yields the relative likelihood of different gravitational potentials , given the observational constraints .",
    "however , even for the simplest , spherical case , there is an infinity of trial potentials , @xmath13 .",
    "much of the previous modeling in the literature has focused on testing the constant mass - to - light ratio hypothesis , for which the sequence of trial potentials is one - dimensional , and can be labeled by @xmath173 .",
    "however , there are two cases of principal interest in which the total mass density is not proportional to the luminous stellar density , namely if ( a ) there is a massive black hole at the center of a galaxy , or ( b ) the luminous galaxy is embedded in a dark halo . while in case ( a ) the set of trial potentials is characterized by two parameters , @xmath173 and the black hole mass @xmath201 , case ( b ) requires a more complex treatment . in the application of our technique below , to study the presence and properties of a dark halo in ngc  2434 , we consider three classes of potentials . in each case",
    "the goal is to determine whether the given class of potentials is consistent with the data , and for what values of the parameters .    1 .   constant mass - to - light ratio models , representing the case without a dark halo ( or the case in which the dark and luminous matter have the same spatial distribution ) .",
    "the gravitational potential is derived directly from the deprojected stellar luminosity ( and thus mass ) distribution , with the mass - to - light ratio @xmath163 as the only free parameter .",
    "2 .   logarithmic potentials , as a popular case of an ad hoc functional form for the gravitational potential of a galaxy with a dark halo , with the ( constant ) circular velocity @xmath5 as the only free parameter .",
    "3 .   cosmologically motivated ` star+halo ' models , based on the recent work by nfw .",
    "these models use dark matter mass profiles predicted from collisionless cosmological simulations , which are modified by the baryonic / stellar mass accumulating at their center under the assumption of adiabatic invariance .",
    "the motivation and construction of these potentials is described in detail in appendix  b. the resulting potentials are characterized by two parameters : the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath173 and a characteristic scale velocity @xmath2 of the dark halo .      we combine the technique discussed in section  2 with the sequence of trial potentials described in section  3.1 , to ask what range of gravitational potentials are compatible with the observed photometry and kinematics of ngc  2434 .",
    "this is a nearly round ( e0 ) elliptical galaxy at 20 @xmath202 , with absolute luminosity @xmath203 ( @xmath204 ; @xmath205 throughout this paper ) .",
    "rotation is unimportant ( @xmath206 ) .",
    "the kinematic data ( @xmath12 and @xmath132 ) are from c95 , and extend to @xmath207 ; the photometry is from carollo & danziger ( 1994 ) , and extends to @xmath208 .",
    "ngc 2434 is one of the few early - type galaxies where the stellar kinematics , including the shape of the vp , have been measured to @xmath209 ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "c95 showed that the kinematics of ngc 2434 could not be fit with axisymmetric constant mass - to - light ratio models with a df of the form @xmath211 ( for the case of ngc 2434 , which is nearly round on the sky , these reduce essentially to spherical isotropic @xmath49 models ) . from the sign of the discrepancy between their simple models and the data , they also _ inferred _ that no other model without dark matter would fit the observational constraints",
    "here we take the analysis two steps further : ( i ) we _ demonstrate _ that ngc  2434 s kinematics can not be fit by any constant mass - to - light ratio model , regardless of the anisotropy of the orbital distribution ; and ( ii ) we explore the issue of _ how much _ dark matter is required to match the data .",
    "we parameterized the luminosity density as @xmath212^{\\beta},\\ ] ] ( with @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath215 , see c95 ) , and calculated the luminous gravitational potential upon assumption of a constant mass - to - light ratio @xmath163 .",
    "as in the test case of section  2.5 , an orbit library was calculated for only one value of @xmath163 , which was subsequently scaled to arbitrary values of @xmath163 .",
    "we used a grid of @xmath216 orbits in @xmath14 and @xmath85 , with each orbit ` built ' from 25 sub - orbits .",
    "the energy grid ranged from @xmath217 to @xmath218 .",
    "our technique was used to fit the data ( with regularization as discussed in section  2.4 ) , for b - band mass - to - light ratios @xmath219 ranging from 3.75 to 10 ( in solar units ) .",
    "figure  6 shows the fits for various values of @xmath219 .",
    "the best fit is found for @xmath220 , but the observational data can not be well fit by these models for _ any _ value of @xmath219 . for all values",
    "the algorithm invokes a highly anisotropic df , in which the anisotropy is radically different between the inner and outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "however , at large radii none of the models can match a dispersion profile as flat as observed , while maintaining the observed nearly gaussian vps . compared to the best - fitting models presented in section  3.2.3 ,",
    "the constant mass - to - light ratio models can be ruled out at the @xmath221% confidence level , independent of the orbital anisotropy of the system .",
    "it is worth noting that this rejection of the constant mass - to - light ratio hypothesis requires the observed constraints on the vp , i.e. , the knowledge that the vp is approximately gaussian @xmath222 .",
    "if only the surface brightness and the velocity dispersion are used as constraints , an ( almost ) acceptable model can be found with constant mass - to - light ratio .",
    "scale - free logarithmic potentials have @xmath223 .",
    "such potentials have a constant circular velocity @xmath5 , and have therefore been popular as approximations to the potentials of galaxies with dark halos .",
    "although the stellar kinematics of elliptical galaxies at @xmath224 can be well fit by models with logarithmic potentials ( kochanek 1994 ) , constant mass - to - light ratio models generally provide equally good fits ( van der marel 1991 ) .",
    "however , studies of gravitational lensing statistics ( maoz & rix 1993 ) and gravitational lensing observations for individual galaxies ( kochanek 1995 ) strongly rule out these constant mass - to - light ratio models , whereas logarithmic potentials do provide good fits . logarithmic potentials therefore provide the logical next step in our modeling of ngc 2434 .",
    "we calculated orbit libraries for logarithmic potentials with @xmath5 ranging from 250 to @xmath225 , in similar fashion as in section  3.2.1 . a model with @xmath8",
    "was found to provide an excellent fit to the data , as shown in figure 7 .",
    "the distribution function is smooth and contiguous , and close to isotropic .",
    "the small error bar on @xmath5 illustrates that the addition of vp shape constraints allows the normalization of the potential to be accurately determined , provided that its shape is assumed to be known a priori .",
    "so far , we have shown that constant mass - to - light ratio models fail , whereas a model with a logarithmic potential succeeds in fitting the data for ngc 2434 .",
    "the cosmologically motivated star+halo potentials discussed in appendix  b provide a continuous sequence that connect these two cases .",
    "we computed a grid of these potentials , with @xmath219 in the range @xmath22610 and @xmath2 in the range of 0@xmath227 ( @xmath228 corresponds to the constant mass - to - light ratio model ) .",
    "circular velocity curves for some of the resulting potentials are shown in figure  8 .",
    "we calculated orbit libraries in these potentials , in similar fashion as in section  3.2.1 . for each @xmath229",
    "the orbital distribution was found that best reproduced the data , with the corresponding @xmath0 . with these potentials",
    "an excellent fit can be obtained to the data .",
    "as an example , figure  9 shows a model with @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "figure  10 shows the grid of models that were calculated to explore the relative likelihood of models in the @xmath229 plane .",
    "the area of each point corresponds to the logarithm of their relative likelihood .",
    "there is a clear anti - correlation between @xmath219 and the mass of the halo ( proportional to @xmath232 ) .",
    "this is because the most robustly constrained quantity is the mass inside a characteristic radius ( @xmath233 ) , which could be either stellar or dark .",
    "this anti - correlation is quantified in figure 11 , which shows the 68% and 95% confidence regions for the joint distribution of @xmath229 .",
    "figure 11 also shows that the best fitting parameters are @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "the errors quoted refer to the 68% confidence region of each parameter individually .",
    "interestingly , the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath219 for the best fit models is only 50% of the value for the best - fitting constant mass - to - light ratio model shown in figure  6 , which is , however , a poor fit . even with a minimum halo of @xmath236 , roughly the smallest value allowed by the data , it is still only 62% .",
    "thus constant mass - to - light ratio models tend to overestimate the true stellar mass - to - light ratio when a dark halo is present .",
    "the reason is that these models attempt to reproduce roughly the correct mass within a characteristic radius ( @xmath233 ) , but have no other option than to ascribe this mass to the stars .",
    "the best - fitting models ( e.g. , that in figure  10 ) have circular velocity curves that are nearly flat ( see figure  8) .",
    "their potential resembles that of the best - fitting logarithmic potential in figure  9 . as a result ,",
    "their orbital distribution is also very similar .",
    "we have described an extension of schwarzschild s method that is capable of modeling the full line - of - sight velocity distributions of galaxies . similarly to what is done in the original scheme , we build galaxy models by computing a representative library of orbits in a given potential , and determine the non - negative superposition of these orbits that best fits an observed set of photometric and kinematic constraints .",
    "we have extended the technique to predict the full vp shapes for all models , and to include them in the fit to the data as a set of linear constraints .",
    "this allows us to fully exploit the high quality kinematical and vp shape data that are now becoming available , and so to constrain the anisotropy of the velocity distribution .",
    "the latter has been the main uncertainty in previous attempts to infer the gravitational potentials of elliptical galaxies from observational data .",
    "explicit modeling of vps also removes systematic errors in the comparison to the lowest - order velocity moments @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we characterize the vps through their gauss - hermite moments .",
    "measurements of observed vps are now routinely specified by constraints on these moments .",
    "this is useful in practice , because data on observed vps are often reported as constraints on the gauss - hermite moments .",
    "it is also computationally convenient , because it reduces vp histograms with 3050 bins to a small number of parameters .",
    "however , our technique is not restricted to the use of gauss - hermite moments . in principle one may fit individual velocity bins of observed vps , if such data is available ( as it is , e.g. , in the technique of rix & white 1992 ) .",
    "however , this does increase storage and memory requirements , while also increasing the size , and therefore the computational complexity , of the nnls fit .",
    "we also extend schwarzschild s method as a modeling tool by taking into account the error on each observational constraint in finding the best matching orbit superposition .",
    "hence we obtain an objective measure for the quality - of - fit . only projected , observable quantities are included in the fit .",
    "we have also outlined how to include the psf and the detailed sampling of the data in the data  model comparison by convolving each orbit and sampling it over the observational apertures .",
    "this procedure is especially important in the study of galactic nuclei .",
    "we enforce smoothness of the model dfs in phase space through a simple regularization scheme .",
    "the scheme presented in section 2 is valid for any geometry .",
    "however , in this first paper , we restricted ourselves to spherical systems which allows swift numerical calculation of the orbit libraries .",
    "the orbit superposition scheme was presented in its general form .",
    "this allows us to test new elements of our technique in the most straightforward way .",
    "we tested our method by constructing models that reproduce pseudo - data drawn from an isotropic hernquist model , with and without inclusion of vp shape constraints in the fit .",
    "the results clearly demonstrate the importance of these constraints in narrowing down the range of potentials that can fit a given velocity dispersion profile when no assumptions are made about the form of the df .    as an application we have considered the case of dark halos around elliptical galaxies .",
    "we used our technique to interpret the stellar kinematical and vp shape data out to @xmath209 for the e0 galaxy ngc  2434 .",
    "models were constructed with a constant mass - to - light ratio , with logarithmic potentials , and with cosmologically motivated star+halo potentials .",
    "the latter are based on the cosmological simulations by nfw , but are modified to incorporate the accumulation of baryonic matter under the assumption of adiabatic invariance .",
    "models without a dark halo are ruled out .",
    "both a logarithmic potential and a cosmologically motivated star+halo potential can provide an excellent fit to the data .",
    "the dark halo of ngc 2434 is such that roughly half of the mass within an effective radius is dark .",
    "models without a dark halo therefore tend to overestimate the mass - to - light ratio of the stellar population by a factor of @xmath9 .",
    "the best - fitting star+halo potential has a circular velocity curve that is constant ( ` flat ' ) to within @xmath6 from @xmath237 to @xmath238 .",
    "this constant circular velocity is close to that of the best - fitting logarithmic potential , which has @xmath239 .",
    "the results presented here provide a first test of the conjecture that elliptical galaxies and spirals of the same stellar mass started out in similar dark matter halos . obviously , the two types of galaxies differ in the degree to which the baryons were concentrated at their centers ( with ellipticals being much denser ) .",
    "if the ` baryon contraction ' led to a flat rotation curve in spirals , it should have led to a centrally peaked ( and hence outward falling ) rotation curve in ellipticals .",
    "the nearly constant circular velocity in ngc 2434 is , however , inconsistent with this idea .",
    "the extension to axisymmetric systems is described in detail in a forthcoming paper ( cretton 1997 ) .",
    "the application to the galaxy m32 , to investigate the presence of a massive central black hole , is discussed in van der marel ( 1997a , b ) . a further extension to tumbling triaxial systems",
    "is in progress .",
    "another possible extension is to include radial variations in the stellar population .",
    "this can be achieved by choosing a radially varying @xmath163 , or by including the color and line - strength gradients in the set of constraints , while allowing each orbit to be occupied by stars with different physical properties .",
