    "the threshold theorem for fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite has established the fact that large quantum computations can be performed with arbitrary accuracy , provided that the error level of the elementary components of the quantum computer is below a certain threshold .",

    "we note that since the initial work of @xcite a number of distinct approaches to topological fault - tolerance emerging in lattice systems are being pursued ; see @xcite .",
    "the key element of our method is based on topological tools that become available when the dimensionality of the cluster is increased from two to three . in 3d , we combine the universality already found in 2d cluster states @xcite with the topological error - correcting capability of kitaev s toric code @xcite . then , a one - dimensional sub - structure of the cluster is `` carved out '' by performing local @xmath4-measurements .",

    "the procedure is this : we start with a bell state , encode one of its qubits with the reed - muller quantum code and measure each of the 15 qubits leaving the encoder in the eigenbasis of @xmath161 .",
