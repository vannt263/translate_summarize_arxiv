    "attempts to understand the phenomenon of spiral structure in galaxies have a long history .",
    "it has become clear nowadays that the spiral structure is a density wave ( or waves ) propagating in a multi - component stellar - gaseous disk . a universal mechanism for the generation of such spiral density waves that successfully explains the rich morphological variety of spiral galaxies does not yet exist .",
    "to describe the observed patterns , a few spiral - generation mechanisms are usually invoked .",
    "some researchers treat the spiral structure as long - lived global modes that last in the galactic disks for tens of galactic rotations @xcite .",
    "others consider the spiral structure as a transient phenomenon , so that the spiral pattern changes many times during the galactic evolution ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for references ) .",
    "@xcite even suggested that spiral structure is merely a product of recent star formation , outlined by the new - born stars .",
    "on observational ground , the problem of the origin of spiral structure was raised recently by  @xcite .",
    "these authors found that galaxies which are optically grand design spirals , show a grand design structure in the near - infrared as well .",
    "the spiral structure therefore is not merely a manifestation of a recent star formation but represents also a spiral structure in the underlying stellar mass distribution .",
    "the paper by  @xcite shows that some flocculent spirals remain flocculent even in the ir .",
    "this observational evidence rules out at least one approach which suggested that the spiral structure in galaxies is a pattern of a recent star formation and does not involve an underlying stellar mass distribution . to understand to",
    "what extent the various suggested explanations are consistent with the observed phenomena of spiral structures , a detailed , quantitative comparison between the theoretical predictions and the observed properties of the spiral patterns in galaxies should be undertaken . in this paper",
    ", we continue our efforts to compare the properties of the observed spiral structure with the theoretical predictions . in previous papers @xcite",
    ", we made such a comparison using a hydrodynamical approach to model the dynamics of galactic disks . in this paper , we simulate three - dimensional collisionless , and collisionless - gaseous models of galactic disks , aiming to determine the model parameters that most closely match the observed spiral pattern in the galaxy ngc 5247 .",
    "we choose this galaxy for our comparison because it is well studied observationally , and its rotation curve as well as disk velocity dispersion and luminosity distribution have been accurately determined .    in the cases that have been studied ,",
    "the admixture of a gaseous component increases the lifetime of a spiral pattern @xcite . in general",
    "however , the lifetime of the spiral patterns in isolated galaxies and the role of gas remain an open issue , that we address in this paper .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the observational properties of the galactic disk of ngc  5247 . in section 3",
    "we present the basic equations and discuss the disk equilibrium .",
    "section 4 presents the results of numerical simulations of a gaseous and a collisionless stellar model of the galaxy ngc 5247 .",
    "section 5 presents the results of our simulations of stellar - gaseous models , and in section 6 we present the concluding remarks .",
    "ngc 5247 shown in figure  [ fig::obs ] is a nearby spiral galaxy which probably belongs to the virgo supercluster of galaxies ( bingelli et a. 1985 ) .",
    "it has a strong , well developed two - armed `` grand - design '' spiral pattern and does not demonstrate any signs of interactions with other galaxies @xcite .",
    "the spiral pattern however looks somewhat lopsided . a low - amplitude spiral pattern is detected in an interarm region .",
    "however the morphology of the galaxy is dominated by the two - armed spiral .",
    "the photometric data do not point to any noticeable bar in the central regions of the disk , therefore ngc 5247 is a classical example of a grand - design spiral galaxy .",
    "our numerical modeling is based on photometric data taken by @xcite .",
    "we take as the radial scale length of the disk @xmath0 kpc as determined by these authors .",
    "the inclination angle of ngc 5247 is rather uncertain .",
    "measurements range from @xmath1 @xcite to @xmath2 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we adopt an inclination of @xmath3 which is close to an average from these references , and a distance to the galaxy of @xmath4  mpc @xcite    the vertical scale of the disk ( @xmath5 ) significantly influences its stability properties .",
    "unfortunately , an accurate estimate of the vertical thickness of the galactic disk is not simple .",
    "@xcite tackled this problem by using the jeans equations applied along the vertical axis of the disk , and estimated the disk thickness of ngc 5247 to be @xmath6 kpc . with this value ,",
    "the ratio of the radial to vertical scale length is @xmath7 .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion as a function of galactocentric radius for ngc  5247 has also been determined from observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig .",
    "[ fig::obscz ] ) .",
    "the measurements by both groups agree with each other and show approximately exponential decrease of the velocity dispersion with radius , which is typical for disk galaxies .",
    "we assume that the potentials of the dark halo and the stellar bulge are static and remain axisymmetric .",
    "such an assumption does not affect the dynamics of a galactic disk because a contribution of high velocity dispersion components to the spiral density waves is insignificant even if they involve most of the galactic mass @xcite .",
    "the galaxy does not have a large central bar , and we exclude from a consideration the models with a bar which is considered to be an effective generator of the spiral density waves ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , observational data do not allow us to estimate the degree of asymmetry of spheroidal subsystems , and the emergence of new free parameters greatly complicates the analysis",

    "it is known from the direct measurements that velocity dispersion in the galactic disks decreases exponentially with radius and has a larger scale length compared to the scale length of the surface brightness ( or density ) . in combination with the fact that the disks are nearly flat and self - gravitating in the vertical direction",

    "the orbital clock is faster at the interiors of the galactic disks , and the mechanism runs more rapidly at smaller radii .",
    "the important part of the swing amplification mechanism is a propagation of the waves in a radial direction with a group velocity .",
    "a propagating wave reflects from the center and/or from a corotation region , changing from trailing to leading , and simultaneously changing a sign of the group velocity and serves , according to toomre , as `` fresh grist to a swing amplified mill '' to operate continuously in a disk .            in this mechanism ,",
    "the inner lindblad resonance is considered as the most important in generation of the spiral density waves .",
    "this resonance must be shielded to prevent a fierce damping of the waves . to check the importance of the inner lindblad resonance in generation of spirals",
    ", we performed an artificial experiment with our hydrodynamical model imposing an absorption region in the inner regions of the disk where all perturbations are zeroed out.this cuts the feedback loop and destroys amplification of spiral perturbations .",
    "we performed a series of 2d simulations of the unstable 2-d gaseous disk with such an artificially imposed `` absorption ring '' where all perturbations are forced to be zero and macroscopic characteristics of the disk are set to be unperturbed in a smooth way .",
    "[ fig::omegacor ] shows angular velocity , epicyclic frequency and positions of resonances for such a disk .",
    "as one can see , the model does not harbor the inner lindblad resonance , so an absorption ring was imposed artificially to mimic its influence .",
    "[ fig::abs_ring ] shows a result of such simulations . on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig::abs_ring ] is shown a two - armed spiral pattern developing in an unstable template \" gravitating disk .",
    "the left panel shows the results of simulations when an absorption ring has been imposed close to the disk center .",
    "the disk remains unstable and a two - armed spiral is developing out of noise perturbations .",
    "we find that the spiral perturbations develop in the disk independently of the position of the absorption ring , be it inside , or outside the corotation resonance .",
    "an instructive experiment is to impose the absorption ring at corotation .",
    "the behavior of perturbations changes dramatically in this case ( fig .",
    "[ fig::cmp ] ) .",
    "the growth of a two - armed spiral is totally suppressed , and a multi - armed spiral starts to grow with a four - armed spiral prevailing .",
    "these experiments illustrate that the qualitative picture of spiral growth by swing amplification is not necessarily as relevant as once thought . instead",
    ", the corotation resonance may be more important in spiral generation .",
    "the issue of transient spirals is currently a topic of heated debate .",
    "@xcite finds that galaxies undergo a secular evolution that leads to a redistribution of the disk matter and heats the disk stars so they gradually rize above the galactic plane in the disk central regions .",
    "both effects are the natural ingredients of a presence of the spiral density wave .",
    "stars migrate inside and outside the corotation region , and a more and more centrally concentrated density distribution is achieved with time together with the buildup of of an extended outer envelope .",
    "similar effect was found in hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite .",
    "we have built one - component collisionless and hydrodynamical models as well as multi - component stellar - gaseous models of the disk galaxy ngc 5247 .",
    "the models are unstable to @xmath138=2 global modes that form a two - armed spiral pattern with amplitudes of about 1020% , qualitatively similar to the observations .",
    "our simulations show that in purely collisionless models the lifetime of the spiral structure is about a few galactic rotations , and does not last longer than one gyr .",
    "an admixture of a gaseous component with mass of a few percent of the mass of the stellar component significantly increases the lifetime of the spiral structure . in the simulated model of galaxy ngc 5247 ,",
    "the spiral lifetime increases up to 3 gyr , and comparable with the lifetime of galaxies .",
    "the authors would like to thank an anonymous referee for many useful comments and questions .",
    "the authors also express their gratitude for financial support (  grants rfbr 11 - 02 - 12247-ofi - m-2011 , 10 - 02 - 00231 , 12 - 02 - 00685-a , 12 - 02 - 31452 ) and the program for state support for leading scientific schools of the russian federation ( grant nsh-3602.2012.2 ) .",
    "numerical simulations were run at the scientific research computing center on supercomputers `` lomonosov '' and `` chebyshev '' .",
    "s.  khoperskov expresses his gratitude to non - commercial foundation of dmitry zimin `` dynasty '' for financial support ."
