    "the production of prompt photons in hadron - hadron collisions at the tevatron is a subject of intense studies ( see , for example , @xcite ) . at the leading order of qcd , prompt photons",
    "can be produced via quark - gluon compton scattering or quark - antiquark annihilation and so , the cross sections of these processes are strongly sensitive to the parton ( quark and gluon ) content of a proton . besides that the events with an isolated photon are an important tool to study hard interaction processes since such photons emerge without the hadronization phase . in standard qcd , the disagreement between experimental data at the tevatron  @xcite and theoretical description ( see refs . in",
    "@xcite ) is attributed usually to the initial - state soft - gluon radiation or to the intrinsic nonperturbative transverse momentum @xmath1 of the incoming partons .    in the framework of the @xmath1-factorization approach",
    "@xcite the treatment of @xmath1-enhancement and gluon emission is more reasonable . in this approach the transverse momentum of incoming partons",
    "is generated in the course of non - collinear parton evolution of the bfkl type  @xcite . in paper  @xcite to analyse the data  @xcite the proper off - shell expressions for partonic matrix elements and kmr unintegrated parton densities  @xcite have been used .",
    "an important component of the calculations  @xcite is using the unintegrated quark distributions in a proton . at present these densities are available in the framework of kmr approach only .",
    "it makes difficulties for the invistigation of dependence of the calculated cross sections on the non - collinear evolution scheme in the @xmath1-factorization approach .    .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in our paper  @xcite we have used a different way . instead of using the unintegrated quark distributions and the corresponding quark - gluon fusion and/or quark - antiquark annihilation cross sections we have calculated off - shell matrix element of the @xmath2 subprocess , having hope for operating in terms of the unintegrated gluon densities only .",
    "but , first of all , these matrix elements cover only the sea quark contribution .",
    "however , the contribution from the valence quarks is significant only at large @xmath3 , and therefore can be safely taken into account in the collinear lo approximation as an additional one .",
    "secondly , this idea can only work well if the sea quarks appear from the last step of the gluon evolution .",
    "this method does not apply to the quarks coming from the earlier steps of the evolution , if they are , and it is not evident in advance , whether the last gluon splitting dominates or not .",
    "the goal of out study here is to clarify this point in more detail than in  @xcite .",
    "here we use the specific property of the kmr scheme  @xcite which enables us to discriminate between the various components of the quark densities .",
    "we start from the leading order @xmath4 subprocess `` @xmath5 '' , and then divide it into several contributions which correspond to the interactions of valence quarks @xmath6 , sea quarks appearing at the last step of the gluon evolution @xmath7 , and sea quarks coming from the earlier steps @xmath8 .",
    "the kmr approach represents an approximate treatment of the parton evolution mainly based on the dglap equation and incorporating the bfkl effects at the last step of the parton ladder only , in the form of the properly defined sudakov formfactors @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these formfactors already include logarithmic loop correction . in this approximation ,",
    "the unintegrated quark distributions are given by     of the inclusive prompt photon production at @xmath11 gev in the region @xmath12 ( left panel ) and @xmath13 ( right panel ) .",
