    "quasigroups and quasigroup transformations are very useful for construction of cryptographic primitives , error detecting and error correcting codes . the reasons for that are the structure of quasigroups , their large number , the properties of quasigroup transformations and so on .",
    "the quasigroup string transformations @xmath4 and their properties were considered in several papers .",
    "a quasigroup @xmath5 is a groupoid ( i.e. algebra with one binary operation @xmath6 on the finite set @xmath7 ) satisfying the law : @xmath8    in fact , ( [ eden ] ) says that a groupoid @xmath5 is a quasigroup if and only if the equations @xmath9 and @xmath10 have unique solutions @xmath11 and @xmath12 for each given @xmath13 .    in the sequel ,",
    "let @xmath14 be an alphabet of integers ( @xmath15 ) and denote by @xmath16 @xmath17 the set of all finite strings over @xmath18 .",

    "( see @xcite ) defined the transformation @xmath23 by @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "then , for given quasigroup operations @xmath26 on the set @xmath18 , we can define mappings @xmath27 , in the same manner as previous by choosing fixed elements @xmath28 ( such that @xmath29 is corresponding to @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",

    "each class contains @xmath48 elements with the same probabilities and the probability of each @xmath41-tuple in @xmath49-th class is @xmath50 , for @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath52 for some @xmath53 , then the classes with probabilities @xmath54 will be merged in one class with @xmath55 elements . using these results , the authors proposed an algorithm for cryptanalysis .",
    "in paper @xcite , krapez gave an idea for a new quasigroup string transformation based on parastrophes of quasigroups .",
    "a modification of this quasigroup transformation is defined in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", authors showed that the parastrophic quasigroup transformation has good properties for application in cryptography .",
    "namely , using that transformation the number of quasigroups of order 4 useful in cryptography is increased . to complete the proof of goodness of parastrophic quasigroup transformation for cryptography , it is needed to prove that theorem [ teorema stara ] holds for that transformation , too .",
    "it will guarantee that message encrypted by the parastrophic quasigroup transformation will be resistant of a statistical kind of attacks .",
    "in this section , we briefly repeat the construction of parastrophic quasigroup transformation given in @xcite .",
    "recall that every quasigroup @xmath5 has a set of five quasigroups , called parastrophes denoted with @xmath56 @xmath57 which are defined in table 1 .",
    "+    @xmath58    in this paper we use the following notations for parastrophe operations : @xmath59    let @xmath60 be an input message .",

    ", @xmath64 be its parastrophe operations .    using previous transformation @xmath4 , for chosen @xmath2 , @xmath61 and quasigroup @xmath21 we define a parastrophic transformation @xmath65 as follows .    at first , let @xmath66 be the length of the first block , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 . applying the transformation @xmath4 on the block @xmath69 with leader @xmath2 and quasigroup operation @xmath70",
    ", we obtain the encrypted block @xmath71 further on , using last two symbols in @xmath72 we calculate the number @xmath73 which determines the length of the next block .",
    "let @xmath74 , @xmath75  and  @xmath76 .",
    "after applying @xmath77 , the encrypted block @xmath78 is    @xmath79    in general case , for given @xmath49 , let the encrypted blocks @xmath72 , ",
    ", @xmath80 be obtained and @xmath81 be calculated using the last two symbols in @xmath80 , i.e. , @xmath82 . let @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "we apply the transformation @xmath86 on the block @xmath87 and obtain the encrypted block @xmath88 now , the parastrophic transformation is defined as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a concatenation of blocks .",
    "note that the length of the last block @xmath91 may be shorter than @xmath92 ( depends on the number of letters in the input message ) .",

    "the transformation @xmath106 can be defined as :    @xmath107    let @xmath108 be the probability distribution of the letters @xmath109 in an input message .",
    "that implies @xmath110 for each @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "an important property of one transformation for application in cryptography is the uniform distribution of the substrings in the output message @xmath113 .",
    "this property guarantee the resistance of statistical attack . therefore",
    ", we investigate the distribution of substrings in the output message obtained using @xmath0-transformation .",
    "at first we will prove that after applying the transformation @xmath114 on an input message @xmath115 , the letters in transformed message are uniformly distributed .",
    "[ uniformity of letters ] the letter @xmath116 has uniform distribution on the set @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath117 for each @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) .    in this proof",
    "we use the same notations as in construction of parastrophic quasigroup transformation given in the previous section .    at first , note that the leader @xmath2 can be consider as uniformly distributed random variables on the set @xmath18 since it is randomly chosen from the set @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , @xmath120 , i.e. , @xmath121 also , leader @xmath2 is independent of each letter @xmath104 in the input message .",

    "using the equation ( [ funkcija_pe ] ) and total probability theorem , for distribution of @xmath123 , we obtain @xmath124 here , @xmath125 is the inverse quasigroup transformation of @xmath126 , i.e. if @xmath127 , then @xmath128 . note that if @xmath49 runs over all values of @xmath18 then for fixed @xmath129 , the expression @xmath130 runs over all values of a , too .",
    "therefore , @xmath131 i.e. , @xmath132 .",
    "we proceed by induction , and let suppose that @xmath133 .",
    "similarly as previous , using that @xmath134 is the parastrophe operation applied in @xmath135 step we compute the distribution of @xmath136 as follows.@xmath137 according to definition of parastrophic operation given with ( [ funkcija_pe ] ) , we can conclude that the random variables @xmath138 and @xmath139 are independent . applying that in previous equation , we obtain @xmath140 as previous , @xmath141 is the inverse quasigroup transformation of @xmath134 . in the last equation , we use that @xmath142 runs over all values of a when @xmath129 is fixed and @xmath49 runs over all values of @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath143 on this way , we proved that @xmath116 has uniform distribution on the set @xmath18 , for each @xmath144 .    from the theorem 2 we can conclude the follows .",
    "if @xmath145 and @xmath146 then the letters in the message @xmath147 are uniformly distributed , i.e. , the probability of the appearance of a letter @xmath49 at the arbitrary place of the string @xmath147 is @xmath148 , for each @xmath149 .",
    "let @xmath150 be an arbitrary string and @xmath151 .",
    "then the @xmath38-tuples in @xmath147 are uniformly distributed for @xmath40 .",
    "[ uniformity 2 ]    let @xmath152 .",
    "we will prove this theorem by induction .",
    "let suppose that the statement is satisfied for @xmath153 , i.e. , @xmath154 for each @xmath155 and each @xmath156 .",
    "now , let @xmath157 .",

    "@xmath160 where @xmath161 is the parastrophe operation applied in the step @xmath129 and @xmath162 is its inverse transformation , @xmath163 .",
    "now , @xmath164 the last equality is obtained by using the fact that @xmath165 is independent of the vector @xmath166 , since @xmath167 are not used for obtaining @xmath165 .    using the inductive hypothesis @xmath168 , @xmath169 and from previous expression",
    "we obtain that    @xmath170    so , we have proved that @xmath171 for each @xmath172 and each @xmath173 .",
    "we made many experiments in order to present our theoretical results .",
    "here we give an example .",
    "we have randomly chosen a message @xmath174 with 1,000,000 letters of the alphabet @xmath175 with the distribution of letters given in the table [ input dist . ] .",
    "@xmath176    [ input dist . ]",
    "we used the quasigroup ( [ kvazigrupa 40 ] ) and its parastrophes .",
    "@xmath177    after applying @xmath178 on @xmath174 , we got a encrypted message @xmath179 . in each @xmath0-transformation , we chose the length of the first block @xmath180 and the initial leader @xmath181 .",
    "the distribution of letters in the output @xmath147 is given in the table [ output dist . ] .",
    "@xmath182    [ output dist . ]",
    "it is obvious that the distribution of letters in the output message @xmath147 is uniform .",
    "the distribution of pairs , triplets and 4-tuples of letters in @xmath147 are given on the figure [ figure 1 ] , figure [ figure 2 ] and figure [ figure 3 ] .",
    "on the figure [ figure 1 ] , the pairs are presented on the @xmath11-axis in the lexicographic order ( @xmath183 , @xmath184 ,  , @xmath185 ) . on the similar way , the triplets and 4-tuples are presented on figure [ figure 2 ] and figure [ figure 3 ] .",
    "we can see on figure [ figure 1 ] and figure [ figure 2 ] that after three applications of @xmath0-transformations , the pairs and triplets are also uniformly distributed as we proved in theorem [ uniformity 2 ] .",
    "also , we can see on figure [ figure 3 ] that the distribution of the 4-tuples in @xmath147 is not uniform , but that distribution is closer to the uniform distribution than the distribution of 4-tuples in the input message .",
    "next , we check whether theorem 2 in @xcite is satisfied when @xmath0-transformation is applied .",
    "the distribution of pairs after one application of @xmath0-transformation is presented on figure [ figure 4 ] a ) . on figure",
    "[ figure 4 ] b ) , we present the distribution of pairs after one application of @xmath4-transformation .",
    "we can see that probabilities of pairs are divided in 4 classes on figure [ figure 4 ] b ) as the theorem 2 in @xcite claims .",
    "but we can not distinguish any classes for probabilities on figure [ figure 4 ] a ) .",
    "this means that the algorithm for cryptanalysis proposed in @xcite can not be applied when an input message is encrypted by @xmath0-transformation .",
    "therefore encryption by @xmath0-transformation is more resistant on statistical kind of attacks .",
    "+ a)b )    note that for relevant statistical analyses , we must have enough large input message .",
    "namely , in experiments , the probabilities of @xmath1-tuples are computed as relative frequencies .",
    "so , a relative frequency of an event tends to probability only if we have enough large sample .",
    "the relevant statistical analyses can not be done for shorter message .",
    "therefore , statistical kind of attack is impossible on not enough large input message .",
    "note that if an intruder catches and concatenates a lot of short messages encrypted by the same @xmath100-transformation , it will obtain a long message and it can apply a statistical attack .",
    "but , the attack will be impossible if we change quasigroups used in encryption @xmath100-transformation more often .",
    "in this paper we proved that after @xmath1 applications of @xmath0-transformation on an arbitrary message the distribution of @xmath2-tuples ( @xmath186 ) is uniform and we can not distinguish classes of probabilities in the distribution of @xmath41-tuples .",
    "this means that if @xmath0-transformation is used as encryption function the obtained cipher messages are resistant on statistical kind of attacks when the number @xmath1 of applications of @xmath0-transformation is enough large .    in @xcite",
    ", the authors concluded that @xmath4-transformation can be applied in cryptography as encryption function since the number of quasigroups is huge one ( there are more than @xmath187 quasigroups when @xmath188 ) and the brute force attack is not reasonable .",
    "if @xmath0-transformation is used in encryption algorithm then the secret key will be a triplet @xmath189 . in that case",
    ", the brute force attack also is not possible since except the quasigroup operation @xmath6 and leader @xmath2 , the key contains the length of the first block @xmath61 which has influence of the dynamic of changing of parastrophes .    at the end , in @xcite authors",
    "proved that @xmath0-transformation has better cryptographic properties than @xmath4-transformation for quasigroups of order 4 .",
    "namely , some of fractal quasigroups of order 4 become parastrophic non - fractal and they can be used for designing of cryptographic primitives .",
    "investigation for quasigroups of larger order can not be done in real time since their number is very large .",
