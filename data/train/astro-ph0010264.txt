    "celeste has been in stable operation with a 40 heliostat array since october 1999 .",
    "our main targets during this initial period have been the three most reliably detected sources in the tev sky ; the crab nebula , markarian 421 and markarian 501 .",
    "our detection of the crab nebula is described elsewhere in these proceedings @xcite .",
    "this report is concerned with the observations of mkn 421 .",
    "mkn 421 is the closest x - ray selected bl lac object ( z=0.030 ) and was the first extragalactic object detected at tev energies @xcite .",
    "the emission from this source is extremely variable over timescales as short as 15 minutes @xcite and multiwavelength observations have shown that the tev variability is correlated with the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "observations in the 50  gev region , not possible until now , will help to improve our understanding of the emission processes at work .",
    "the celeste experiment is described in detail in the experimental proposal @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "briefly , celeste uses forty , @xmath0 heliostats of a former solar electrical plant at the themis site in the french pyrnes ( n. @xmath1 , e. @xmath2 , altitude 1650  m ) .",
    "the light from the seperate heliostats is resolved using secondary optics at the top of a 100  m tall tower . at the secondary mirror focus",
    "is one pmt for each heliostat .",
    "a solid winston cone at the face of each pmt defines the field of view of each tube to be 10  mrad .",
    "the trigger is constructed by summing eight pmt signals in five groups and sending each sum to a discriminator with a threshold set to 4.5 photo - electrons ( pe ) per heliostat .",
    "a logic coincidence of at least three of the five groups triggers the experiment .",
    "each pmt signal is sent to a 1  ghz flash adc circuit which digitizes the signal .",
    "when a trigger occurs , digitization stops and a window of 100  ns centered at the nominal erenkov pulse arrival time is read out .",
    "celeste , with its large mirror area per pmt , is very susceptible to systematic effects in the data caused by differences in the night sky background light between the on source observation and off source control data . in the case of mkn 421",
    ", a star of magnitude 6.1 located at the source position causes a difference of @xmath315% in the pmt anode currents between the two fields . to compensate ,",
    "we have adapted the software padding method proposed by cawley @xcite for use with our fadc data @xcite .",
    "we also apply a software trigger by using the fadc data to reconstruct the five trigger group sums and then demanding:@xmath44 groups @xmath55.0  pe per heliostat .",
    "this increases the energy threshold , but provides us with comparable background data in the on and off source fields .",
    "we also require @xmath6  erenkov peaks with an amplitude @xmath7  digital counts to ensure the shower parameters are measurable .    the rest of the analysis",
    "is concerned with improving the gamma ray signal to hadron background ratio using two parameters .",
    "the first , @xmath8 , is a measurement of the homogeneity of the light distribution between the trigger groups and should be the most efficient background rejection cut according to our simulations , rejecting 80% of the remaining hadrons for only 30% of the gammas .",
    "the second parameter , @xmath9 , is the shower axis angle relative to the pointing direction reconstructed using two points ; the barycentre of the light distribution at ground level and the position of the shower core relative to the pointing direction at the altitude of maximum emission deduced from a sphere fit to the erenkov pulse arrival times at the heliostats .",
    "mkn 421 was observed between november 1999 and march 2000 . after rejecting those observations with bad weather or equipment problems ,",
    "the dataset consists of 80 on / off pairs with an on source exposure of 22.5 hours .    the cat imaging telescope @xcite , situated on the same site as celeste , made observations of mkn 421 during the same period . in december 1999 , no evidence for a signal was reported by cat .",
    "the left - hand plot of fig .",
    "[ theta ] shows the distribution of the difference in the shower orientation parameter , @xmath9 , between the on and off source observations as measured by celeste during december .",
    "no evidence for a signal at low @xmath9 is seen ( for 1.5 hours of on source exposure ) .",
    "table  [ tquiet ] shows the number of events remaining at each stage of the analysis .",
    "l|ccccc & on & off & excess & significance & s / b raw & @xmath10 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 & @xmath14 software trigger & @xmath15 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 @xmath26 & @xmath27 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath31 @xmath32 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & @xmath36 & @xmath37    in january / february 2000 cat reported that mkn 421 was in an active state .",
    "in particular , two bright flares were observed , with emission levels @xmath52 crab .",
    "the right - hand plot of fig .  [ theta ] shows the difference distribution in @xmath9 for celeste observations during these flares ( 5.2 hours of on source exposure ) .",
    "a strong signal is apparent at low values of @xmath9 , as expected for gamma rays .",
    "the significance of the excess is 8.1  @xmath38 .",
    "table  [ tflare ] shows the improvement in the signal / background ratio at each stage of the analysis after the initial cleaning cuts .",
    "the significance before cuts is not very meaningful as the excess , while undoubtably largely due to gamma rays , is contaminated by systematic effects due to sky noise differences .",

[ lightcurve ] shows the lightcurve as observed by both cat and celeste on a night by night basis .",
    "emission levels up to @xmath66  crab ( @xmath67 ) were observed , detectable by celeste in a single night .",
    "also shown in the figure is a plot of the gamma ray flux measured by celeste against that measured by cat showing reasonably good correlation .",
    "the tev blazar mkn 421 has been detected by celeste for the first time at an energy of @xmath68  gev .",
    "evidence for night by night variablility has been observed , and the variablity measurements by celeste are correlated with those of cat .",
    "importantly , a non - detection of the source in a quiescent state , followed by a very significant detection in a flaring state demonstrates that the celeste analysis is working , and that we have been able to correct for systematic effects due to night sky light differences between the on and off source fields .",
