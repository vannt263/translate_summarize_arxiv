    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : bonds ]        to find the most stable adsorption configurations of lactide on the pt(321 ) surface , we built on previous results that oxygen atoms interact preferably with the kink atoms.@xcite for lactide there is oxygen in the dioxane ring and as carbonyl substituents .",
    "we therefore generated test configurations with either of the two species above a kink site and rotation of the molecule in steps of 60 degrees .",
    "we did this for both ll - lactide and dd - lactide on pt(321)@xmath0 ( see table [ tab : bonds ] .    for most adsorption configurations mutiple oxygen atoms came to interact with kink sites due to their high density on this specific surface .",
    "it turns out that the configurations that have carbonyl oxygen interacting with the kink sites are the most stable ones , while the dioxane ring oxygen interacts more weakly .",
    "in fact , all adsorption sites generated from the carbonyl oxygen atoms bound to kink sites relaxed to configurations with both carbonyl oxygen atoms bound to kink sites .",
    "all of these configurations are more stable than the most stable one generated with the ring atom bound to a kink site .",
    "the difference between the carbonyl - kink bound configurations amounts to differences in the two neighboring kink sites that the second carbonyl oxygens binds to .",
    "there are six possible binding combinations to nearest kink sites , of which only three are symmetry inequivalent due to the c2 rotational symmetry around the center of mass of the lactide molecule .",
    "of these three , two are configurations where the lactide bridges the facet , and one where the molecule attaches with both carbonyl oxygen atoms to the same ridge ( cf .",
    "[ fig : im1 ] ) .",
    "the most stable of the three configurations turns out to be a facet bridging configuration , with both methyl groups over the same facet , for both ll- and dd - lactide ( see table [ tab : energ ] ) . for ll - lactide ,",
    "the second most stable configuration is the other bridging configuration , about 0.06 ev higher in energy .",
    "the least stable of the three is the one with the molecule bound along the ridge , which is 0.13 ev higher in energy than the most stable one . for dd - lactide",
    "the ranking in energy of the second and third most stable configurations is opposite to the one calculated for ll - lactide , with adsorption energies 0.11 ev and 0.17 ev above the most stable configuration .",
    "the binding energies are similar to the binding energies obtained for a single lactic acid molecule on pt(321).@xcite also , the non - local correlation energy part of the binding energy is larger than the total binding energy , showing the importance of the van der waals forces to the binding of lactide on pt(321 ) .",
    "the bond lengths of the carbonyl oxygens to the kink atoms of the surface vary between 2.19   and 2.48   for all configurations , except for one oxygen atom that is unbound ( bond length of 3.64  ) in the facet - bridging 2 configuration of dd - lactide .",
    "to determine if the ring - opening reaction might occur on pt(321 ) we found the most stable adsorption configurations of ring - opened versions of ll- and dd - lactide .",
    "we assume that the dangling bonds that result from the ring - opening bind to neighboring pt atoms on a ridge as a result of the ring - opening reaction being catalyzed by a kink atom . without putting too much strain on the molecule ,",
    "the possible combinations are one dangling bond binding to a kink atom and the other one either to the neighboring ridge atom or the next kink atom .",
    "we refer to these configurations as kink - ridge and kink - kink , respectively . for the kink - ridge configurations",
    "there is the possibility to bind either the carbon or the oxygen dangling bond to the kink atom .",
    "for all three possibilities , two configurations related to each other by a rotation of the molecule by 180 degrees exist .",
    "so , overall , 6 configurations were calculated for each lactide enantiomer .",
    "the two most stable configurations for each enantiomer are given in table [ tab : energ ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : im2 ] . for both enantiomers ,",
    "the kink - ridge conformation with the carbon atom bound to the ridge atom is the most stable , with the more open kink - kink conformation being less stable by an insignificant 0.02 - 0.03 ev .",
    "this small energy difference indicates that the molecule might be able to transfer back- and forth between the two states at an appropriate temperature .",
    "interestingly , the energy of the ring - opened lactide on pt(321 ) is also very close to the energy of the pristine molecule , being more stable by 0.03 ev and 0.05 ev for ring - opened ll- and dd - lactide , respectively .    for all configurations the dangling bonds from the ring - opening bind to surface atoms with small bond lenghts , indicating strong bonds .",
    "the pt - c bonds exhibit bond lenghts of 1.96   and 1.99   for the kink - ridge and kink - kink configurations , respectively .",
    "the pt - o bond lengths are similar with 2.01   ( 2.02   for dd - lactide ) and 1.98   for the kink - ridge and kink - kink configurations , respectively . for the kink - ridge conformations ,",
    "additionally one carbonyl oxygen interacts with a kink atom with bond distances of 2.23   for ll - lactide and 2.20   for dd - lactide . for the kink - kink configurations this bond is not formed , possibly contributing to its slightly lower stability .",
    "the distances between the carbon and oxygen atoms that were forming the ring are 2.93   ( 2.81  ) for the kink - ridge conformation and 4.83   ( 4.88  ) for the kink - kink conformation of ll - lactide ( dd - lactide ) . taken together , the kink atoms provide an ideal binding site for the ring - opened molecule that stabilizes the dangling bonds at a small distance . additionally , in the case of the kink - kink binding configurations it is stabilized by a carbonyl oxygen - pt bond .",
    "after establishing that initial and final states of a ring - opening reaction of lactide on pt(321 ) are similar in energy , we calculated the transition state ( ts ) energy between the two states for both ll- and dd - lactide . to test",
    "if this reaction could indeed be observed on the surface , we also calculated a dehydrogenation at the methyl group as a competing process .",
    "we chose the dehydrogenation since it is often found in on - surface coupling of molecules and therefore seems a natural choice out of a multitude of possible bond - breaking events.@xcite    we found that the ts energy is very low for the ring - opening of ll - lactide at about 0.32 ev above the energy of the most stable adsorption configuration of the intact molecule and 0.35 ev above the energy of the ring - opened final state .",
    "a temperature of 150k would give a boltzmann factor of 10@xmath1 which would , in a transition state theory framework with a realistic trial rate , translate to an observable reaction rate . in comparison ,",
    "the ts for the dehydrogenation of ll - lactide is calculated as 0.78 ev above the most stable adsorption configuration , which would give a boltzmann factor of 10@xmath2 at 150k .",
    "thus , our data indicate that the ring - opening reaction is much easier than the dehydrogenation and , under the assumption that the dehydrogenation is a good proxy for other possible reactions , might be observed at very low temperatures .",
    "there is a small difference in the ts energy for the ring - opening of ll - lactide and dd - lactide of 0.02 ev .",
    "additionally , the energy difference between initial and final states of the reaction is 0.02 ev larger ( -0.03 ev and -0.05 ev for ll - lactide and dd - lactide , respectively ) .",
    "this very subtle energy differences might lead to differences in the ratio of ring - opened to pristine molecules for the two enantiomers and indicate a chiral selectivity , because an 0.02 ev energy difference corresponds to ratios of the boltzmann factors for the two enantiomers of about 1:5 at 150k .",
    "interestingly , the non - local correlation part of the binding energy ( cf .",
    "table [ tab : energ ] ) is larger for the ring - opening tss than for all other configurations calculated .",
    "it stabilizes the molecule by 0.4 ev ( 0.33 ev ) for ll- ( dd)-lactide , when compared to the initial state of the reaction .",
    "the non - local correlation binding energy component is also 0.07 ev larger for the ts of dd - lactide than for the corresponding state of ll - lactide .",
    "this difference is thus larger then the calculated difference between the two enantiomers showing that an optimization of the non - local binding energy component for dd - lactide leads to our calculated chiral selectivity in the transition states .    at the ts",
    ", the bond length of the c - o bond that is eventually broken is extended from 1.37   to 1.78   in the case of ll - lactide ( see table [ tab : bonds ] . at the same time , the three molecule - surface bonds that are eventually formed ( pt - c , pt - o and the bond of the carbonyl oxygen ) are already near their equilibrium value with bond lenghts of 2.06  , 2.17   and 2.15  , respectively . for dd - lactide",
    "the molecule - surface bond lengths are very similar , but the c - o bond is broken already at 1.68  .",
    "this smaller bond length at the ts is correlated with the smaller distance in the final state of the reaction . for the dehydrogenation ,",
    "the c - h bond length is extended to 1.52   and the bonds formed during the reaction , i.e. the pt - c bond and the pt - h bond are 2.24   and 1.61   long , respectively .",
    "we identified the most stable adsorption geometries of ll- and dd - lactide on pt(321)@xmath0 .",
    "the molecules are most stable in a configuration bridging the 111 oriented facets with the carbonyl oxygen binding to kink atoms .",
    "ring - opened lactide was found to bind most strongly with its dangling bonds to a kink atom and a neighboring atom on the ridge .",
    "configurations with both dangling bonds bound to kink atoms were slightly less stable .",
    "the calculated adsorption energy is about 1.4 ev without any obvious chiral selectivity .",
    "the ring - opened variety of the molecule is marginally more stable with energy differences between the pristine and the ring - opened molecule of only 0.03 ev and 0.05 ev for ll- and dd - lactide , respectively .",
    "a similarly small energy difference is obtained between the different binding patterns of the ring - opened lactide molecule . for all adsorption configurations , the contribution of van der waals forces to the binding is dominant , as the non - local part of the correlation energy provides more than 100% of the overall binding energy .",
    "energy barriers for the ring - opening reaction are very low at 0.32 ev ( ll - lactide ) and 0.30 ev ( dd - lactide ) which would make this reaction observable already at low temperatures , assuming realistic prefactors in a transition state theory framework .",
    "this small barrier can be understood from the structural similarity of the transition state and the ring - opened state of the molecule . as a result",
    ", the stabilizing molecule - surface interactions of the final state can form simultaneously to the breaking of the c - o bond .",
    "the specific geometry of the kink sites found on the pt(321 ) surface with one ridge atom between two kink atoms seems to be ideal for the ring - opening reaction of lactide .",
    "importantly , this configuration is not as peculiar as it might seem : it should be a feature of every rounded step edge on any pt surface vicinal to the 111 direction .",
    "highly active catalytic sites should therefore be present on real , roughened pt surfaces .    the small energy changes between different ring - opened and pristine states of the molecule points to a sizable population of different configurations already at low temperature .",
    "the small transition state energy should hereby enable the seamless conversion of ring - opened to pristine molecular states .",
    "this structural variability should be important to actually connect two ring - opened molecules , a reaction step that is beyond the scope of this study due to the size of the system .",
    "interestingly , the small difference in energy gain due to ring - opening between ll- and dd - lactide as well as the slightly smaller energy barrier might lead to a subtle difference between ring - opened ll- and dd - lactide molecules that might impact polymerization rates . also , the second facet - bridging configuration of pristine ll - lactide is significantly more stable than the dd - lactide configuration .",
    "this might impact diffusion rates as well as the free energy of the molecule on the surface at finite temperatures .",
    "the first effect would decrease the ratio of ll- to dd- polymerization rates by increasing the likelihood of finding a non - opened lactide molecule at the end of the chain .",
    "the second effect would increase it by providing a better supply of molecules to the chain end . also noteworthy",
    "is the different bond length at which the transition state for the ring - opening occurs .",
    "one of the two might be preferable at different average positions of the kink atoms on real , roughened pt surfaces at finite temperatures .",
    "the energy barrier for dehydrogenation is significantly larger than for the ring - opening at 0.78 ev .",
    "these data indicate that pt surfaces vicinal to the 111 direction are a possible catalyst for ring - opening polymerization of lactic acid to poly - lactic acid",
    ". there are signs of enantiomeric selectivity of the reaction , with subtle differences in stable state energies and the energy barrier , together with differences in geometries .",
