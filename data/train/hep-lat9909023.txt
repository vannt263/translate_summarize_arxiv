    "since it was suggested by t  hooft @xcite and mandelstam @xcite that monopole condensation in nonabelian gauge theories may be an explanation for the confinement mechanism , many studies have been devoted to the magnetic properties of these theories @xcite .    in the present study , we probe the vacuum structure of pure su(2 ) gauge theory by inserting a static monopole - antimonopole pair into the vacuum and measuring its free energy at different separations and different temperatures . while in the classical theory there is a coulomb potential between su(2 ) monopoles , we expect the quantum theory to show a yukawa - potential if there is a monopole condensate , and a coulomb - potential , if quantum fluctuations do not produce a magnetically screening object .",
    "the method we use for inserting a static su(2 ) monopole pair on the lattice was put forward by t  hooft and others @xcite and essentially amounts to introducing a magnetic flux tube by multiplying the couplings with an element of the center of the gauge group ( @xmath0 for su(2 ) ) on a string of plaquettes in every timeslice ( schematically shown in fig.[chain ] ) .",
    "this tube carries a flux of @xmath1 , so at each end of the flux tube is a elementary cube with net magnetic outflux @xmath2 .",
    "but since for a compact lattice theory magnetic flux is only defined modulo @xmath3 , both monopoles are indistinguishable and coincide with their own antimonopole .    in order to measure the free energy of a monopole pair , we split the su(2 ) action into two parts with different couplings @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the set of all the plaquettes in the monopole string . in the case where @xmath6 , ( [ act ] ) is the action of a plain su(2 ) theory and for @xmath7 it is the action of su(2 ) with the static monopole pair .",
    "so the free energy difference upon a monopole pair insertion is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the temperature of the system and @xmath10 is the partition function @xmath11    we can calculate @xmath12 using the ferrenberg - swendsen multihistogram method @xcite on histograms of the flux tube energy @xmath13 for a set of @xmath14 s between @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( where the separation between successive @xmath14 s has to be small enough , that neighboring histograms have a substantial overlap ) .",
    "our simulations were performed with couplings between @xmath17 and @xmath18 on systems of volumes , ranging from @xmath19 to @xmath20 . the time extent in our simulation varied between @xmath21 and @xmath22 . for each system , we measured the free energy at monopole separations from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "we used a combined overrelaxation and 3-hit metropolis update algorithm . for every simulation",
    ", we started at @xmath6 with @xmath25 thermalization updates followed by @xmath26 to @xmath27 independent measurements of @xmath28 , separated by @xmath29 updates .",
    "we then decreased @xmath14 in @xmath30 to @xmath31 steps to @xmath7 and performed @xmath32 thermalization updates followed again by the measurement updates . here ,",
    "a single @xmath28 measurement consisted of an average over @xmath33 configurations of the plaquettes on the monopole string on a fixed background configuration .",
    "in fig . [ fmass ] we plot the free energy vs.  monopole pair separation for a @xmath34 system at @xmath35 and different temperatures .",
    "the lines are fits to a yukawa - potential @xmath36    .[masstab]screening masses for @xmath35 in units of the string tension at zero temperature @xmath37 and in lattice units . for comparison ,",
    "the temperature of the system is given .",

    "is clearly ruled out .",
    "the quality of a coulomb fit is @xmath39 for @xmath22 and even worse ( @xmath40 ) for all other cases .    at low temperature",
    ", we can compare our screening masses to the known mass of the lightest glueball state ( table [ gb ] ) .",
    "the masses are roughly in agreement , especially when one ignores the data point at separation @xmath23 , which is most affected by discretization errors .    in fig .",
    "[ fhit ] we plot the screening masses vs.  temperature .",
    "there clearly is an increase of the screening mass with temperature , but we can see no signal of the phase transition .",
