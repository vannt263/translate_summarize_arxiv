    "the sign change in the pair potential on the fermi surface , which is possible only in the presence of nodes in the gap functions , is the source of a topologically nontrivial superconducting phase preserving time - reversal symmetry  @xcite .",
    "a prescription called dimensional reduction enables us to topologically characterize such nodal superconductors  @xcite . in a @xmath0-dimensional superconductor , it is possible to choose a one - dimensional brillouin zone by fixing a ( @xmath0 - 1)-dimensional wave number at a certain point ( say @xmath1 ) .",
