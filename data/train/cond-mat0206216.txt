    "recently , much attention has been focused on understanding the pseudogap  @xcite phenomena of the high - temperature superconductors .",
    "one possible explanation  @xcite invokes the notion that the pseudogap is due to the presence of pairing correlations above the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 .",
    "within such a scenario , the lack of long - range phase coherence in the pseudogap is presumed to be due to the proliferation of vortex excitations in it . following the approach of many recent papers  @xcite",
    ", we consider the problem of coupling vortices to the quasiparticles of a d - wave superconductor . as discussed in refs .",
    ", there is an important distinction between the condensation of @xmath2 ( i.e.  singly quantized ) and @xmath3 ( i.e.  doubly quantized ) vortices in a d - wave superconductor .",
    "experimentally  @xcite , magnetic field - induced vortices seem to be exclusively of the singly quantized variety .",
    "we shall take this as evidence that , in considering vortex excitations in the pseudogap regime , it is sufficient to consider only @xmath2 vortices .    the technical issues associated with @xmath2 vortices have been discussed in refs .   and amount to the fact that certain singular gauge transformations ( which arise naturally when considering the bogoliubov  de  gennes  equation in the presence of vortices ) lead to the presence of quasiparticle branch cuts . here",
    "we shall adopt the point of view that these difficulties are not unique to the problem of performing gauge transformations in the presence of vortices : they arise when one considers the general problem of making gauge - transformations on multiply - connected manifolds .",
    "for example , consider the aharonov - bohm problem  @xcite , in which one imagines attaching current leads to a doubly - connected metallic ring through which a solenoid penetrates . even in the case of a solenoid with a radius sufficently small that the magnetic field is negligible in the ring",
    ", the presence of a nonzero vector potential leads to quantum - mechanical interference of electrons taking different paths around the ring while propagating between the leads .",
    "thus , one can not make a gauge - transformation which eliminates the effect of the vector potential on topologically distinct feynman paths . in a similar sense",
    ", the winding of the pair - potential phase around a superconducting vortex may not be trivially removed by a gauge transformation . in particular , as noted above , making certain singular gauge - transformations in the presence of @xmath2 vortices leads to quasiparticle branch cuts .",
    "our aim here is to discuss a new approach to handling such branch cuts using the topological properties of path integrals .",
    "recently , franz and tesanovic  @xcite have introduced a singular gauge transformation which avoids the introduction of quasiparticle branch cuts via a clever trick involving splitting the vortices into two distinct groups ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) and transforming the electrons relative to group @xmath4 and the holes relative to group @xmath5 .",
    "these authors find that the action governing the quasiparticle dynamics of a d - wave superconductor in the presence of fluctuating vortices is given by the well - known problem of three - dimensional quantum electrodynamics ( qed@xmath0 ) : dirac fermions coupled to a fluctuating berry  gauge field @xmath6 .",
    "however , as we shall discuss , the propagator is _ not _ given by the usual propagator for qed@xmath0 ; it is given by the associated gauge - invariant propagator .",
    "this occurs because @xmath6 is not a physical ( i.e.  electromagnetic ) gauge - field ; thus the propagator must not transform under gauge transformations on @xmath6 .",
    "gauge - invariant propagators have appeared many times in the context of strongly - correlated electron systems  @xcite ; in particular the gauge - invariant propagator for qed@xmath0 exhibits intriguing non - fermi liquid behavior  @xcite .    to obtain further insight into the physics of fluctuating vortices in d - wave superconductors , here",
    "we shall take a novel approach inspired by schulman s",
    "@xcite topological approach to the aharonov - bohm problem .",
    "our task is to shed light on the connection between fluctuating vortices and fluctuating gauge - fields . towards this end",
    ", we shall view a vortex as a hole  which divides a superconductor into a doubly - connected space .",
    "as in the aharonov - bohm problem , the fact that the superconductor is multiply connected means that feynman paths contributing to the quasiparticle propagator fall into topologically distinct sectors . by making different gauge transformations for topologically distinct feynman paths",
    ", we shall see how the quasiparticle branch cuts may be expressed in terms of the berry gauge field @xmath6 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to arrive at the qed gauge theory of vortices in the pseudogap regime of the cuprates via a path integral technique .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : bdg ] we consider the problem of solving the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation in the presence of a static array of vortices .",
    "although our main interest will be in the problem of vortex _ fluctuations _ in a d - wave superconductor , the static case will be sufficient to motivate the technical difficulties associated with vortices in superconductors . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ab ] , we review some results from the theory of the aharonov - bohm effect  @xcite from a point of view due originally to schulman  @xcite in which one considers path integrals in multiply - connected spaces . in sec .  [",
    "sec : static ] , we revisit the bdg eigenproblem from the point of view of gauge transformations in multiply - connected spaces and isolate the effect of the quasiparticle branch cuts on feynman paths . in sec .",
    "[ sec : branch ] , these branch cuts are represented via a functional integral over an auxiliary field @xmath7 ; the theory is constructed to be explicitly invariant under gauge - transformations associated with this field . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamic ] we extend the results of sec .",

    "[ sec : branch ] to the case of dynamic vortex excitations , finally arriving at an expression for the bogoliubov ",
    "de  gennes  propagator ( in the presence of vortices ) as a gauge - invariant green function . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we conclude with a brief discussion of our results .",
    "the qed@xmath0 scenario of the pseudogap regime , like the nodal liquid scenario  @xcite which preceded it , focuses on the effect of vortex excitations on the quasiparticles of a d - wave superconductor . in the present section , we provide motivation by examining the problem of static vortex excitations in a superconductor .",
    "the quasiparticle excitations of a superconductor are described by the bogoliubov ",
    "de  gennes  ( bdg ) equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the chemical potential , @xmath10 is the local superconducting phase , @xmath11 is the electronic charge , and @xmath12 is the usual d - wave pairing operator , which we take to be given by @xmath13 .",
    "we have chosen units in which @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the quasiparticle mass . here ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the electron and hole parts of the bdg wavefunction , respectively . the electromagnetic gauge field @xmath18 ( which we shall often suppress ) and @xmath10 conspire to give this theory the following local @xmath19 symmetry : @xmath20    in the presence of vortices , @xmath10 has singularities at the locations @xmath21 of each vortex ( of vorticity @xmath22 ) : @xmath23 a natural way to proceed with solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : bdg ] ) is to attempt to include the effects of vortex excitations perturbatively by expanding in small phase gradients .",
    "as @xmath10 appears only in the exponential of the off - diagonal terms , one is motivated to perform the following naive gauge transformation @xmath24 this effectively moves the phase from the off - diagonal components and introduces it as a phase gradient in the diagonal components of the bdg equation : @xmath25 however , as discussed by balents et al  @xcite , such a gauge transformation produces branch cuts in the bogoliubov  de  gennes  eigenstates .",
    "this can be seen by noting that , if we assume that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are single - valued functions then eq .  ( [ eq : bdg2 ] )",
    "must be solved under the condition that @xmath26 and @xmath27 each gain a factor of @xmath28 upon encircling every vortex .",
    "the authors of ref .   argue that such branch cuts lead to frustration effects that would strongly favor the pairing of vortices .",
    "thus , by only allowing doubly quantized vortices , there are no branch cuts in the fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 to worry about . here , we follow franz and tesanovic  @xcite in assuming that the correct approach is to consider the condensation of singly - quantized vortices in a d - wave superconductor . they avoid the branch - cut difficulty by making a gauge transformation which does not directly introduce branch cuts but still keeps track of their physical effects .",
    "briefly , their technique  @xcite involves splitting the vorticies into two groups labelled aand band then performing a gauge transformation of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the phase associated only with the vortices in group @xmath4(@xmath5 ) .",
    "this gauge transformation has the advantage of not introducing any branch cuts in the quasiparticle wave function while at the same time treating the electrons and holes on an equal footing .",
    "the berry gauge field @xmath7 emerges , upon averaging over all vortex configurations , as the difference of phase gradients @xmath31 .",
    "in sec .  [ sec : bdg ] we discussed one difficulty associated with solving the bdg equation in the presence of vortex excitations , i.e. , that naive gauge transformations of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) introduce branch cuts in the quasiparticle wavefunctions . to motivate the path integral technique which we shall use to handle these branch cuts , in the present section we review previously known results  @xcite in a related system in which gauge transformations must be made with care : the aharonov - bohm problem  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to find an expression for the propagator @xmath32 for an electron constrained to a ring ; we represent this physical space by the symbol @xmath33 .",
    "a thin solenoid penetrates the origin and is described by a vector potential @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with @xmath36 being the total flux .",
    "the schrdinger equation for @xmath32 takes the form @xmath37 from feynman s path - integral representation of quantum mechanics , we know that @xmath32 may be expressed in terms of a sum over all paths of an amplitude for each path . in the present situation",
    ", the doubly - connected nature of @xmath33 indicates that such paths may be divided into homotopically distinct classes depending on how many times the path in a particular homotopy class winds around the origin .",
    "thus , following schulman  @xcite , we may express @xmath38 in the form @xmath39 where the function @xmath40 contains only feynman paths that wind around the origin @xmath41 times .",
    "the subscript @xmath41 on @xmath42 reminds us that @xmath43 is the same as @xmath42 after having wound @xmath41 times around the origin .",
    "let us consider the physical meaning of @xmath40 .",
    "the space @xmath33 on which eq .",
    "( [ eq : gfshulman ] ) is to be solved has the topology of a torus .",
    "however , by keeping only feynman paths which wind @xmath41 times , it is as if we are solving the same equation on a helix - shaped space which winds @xmath41 times : a helix ( topologically , a line ) is the universal covering space of a torus .",
    "we shall denote the universal covering space by the symbol @xmath44 ; the important properties of @xmath45 are as follows : 1 ) @xmath45 is locally equivalent to @xmath33 , and 2 ) @xmath45 is simply connected .",
    "it is further true that the schrdinger equation [ i.e.  eq .  ( [ eq : gfshulman ] ) ] is satisfied for each of the terms @xmath40 entering eq .",
    "( [ eq : topexp ] )  @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath45 is simply connected means that the quantity @xmath46 is well - defined on it and can be used to simplify the equation for @xmath47 .",
    "thus , by writing @xmath48 it can be seen that @xmath49 satisfies @xmath50 i.e. , it is the green function for the free - particle ( by this we mean @xmath51 ) schrdinger equation on @xmath45 , which we denote by @xmath52 and has the explicit form  @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the modified bessel function and we have written the coordinates @xmath43 and @xmath55 in terms of the radial coordinates @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "we emphasize that this is not the usual two - dimensional free particle propagator , but that part of the propagator due to feynman paths with winding number @xmath41 ( or , equivalently , the free propagator on @xmath44 ) .",
    "the usual free - particle propagator may be obtained from eq .",

    "now imagine that the vortices are time - dependent .",
    "one may of course still construct a conventional feynman path integral even though @xmath66 is time - dependent .",
    "however , since the vortex positions evolve in time , feynman paths parametrized by time do not fall into homotopically inequivalent classes in the same way .",
    "thus , it is convenient to use a path - integral method which treats the time variable @xmath123 on an equal footing with the spatial coordinates .",

    "within such a scheme , one introduces a ficticious temporal coordinate @xmath124 and constructs a path integral representation of the corresponding green function in which the temporal variable in the feyman paths is @xmath124 , not @xmath123 .",
    "for example , consider the following schrdinger equation : @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "it is clear that the propagator @xmath128 may be expressed as a path integral in which the paths are labeled by @xmath124 .",
    "furthermore , it may be simply related to the argument of eq .",

    "the vortices are static relative to the coordinate @xmath124 , allowing us to split the feynman paths into homotopically distinct sectors depending on how they wind relative to them",
    ". this amounts to constructing an equation for @xmath128 that is of the form of eq .",

    "one may also expand the fermions near the nodes of the d - wave order parameter ; by combining the nambu fields @xmath143 into four component dirac spinors  @xcite one may complete the connection to qed@xmath0 . however , for the present purposes it is sufficient to have the above gauge theory be our final expression .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the effect of vortices on the the quasiparticle excitations of d - wave superconductors in an attempt to understand the pseudogap phenomena .",
    "our final expression for the single - particle green function ( i.e.  eq .  ( [ eq : dynamic ] ) ) makes direct contact with the qed@xmath0  @xcite scenario of the pseudogap phenomena . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the original formulation of the qed@xmath0 of the pseudogap phenomena  @xcite relied on splitting the vortices into two groups ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) and making a gauge transformation of the electrons with respect to group @xmath4 and the holes with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "the aim of such an approach is to avoid directly introducing branch cuts in the quasiparticle wavefunctions .",
    "the approach presented here deals with the quasiparticle branch cuts in a more direct fashion , by realizing that the problem of solving the bdg equation in the presence of vortices may be formulated as a problem of making gauge transformations on multiply connected manifolds . by going to the universal covering space of the associated manifold , the branch cuts emerge in a controllable fashion as factors of @xmath89 multiplying various feynman paths .",
    "the field @xmath7 arises in an attempt to mimic the effect of these branch - cuts ; in particular the line integral factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gdef ] ) comes from expressing the branch cut factors @xmath89 associated with various feynman paths in terms of the flux of @xmath6 .",

    ", we have not clarified issues associated with the calculation of the single particle green function [ i.e.  eq .
