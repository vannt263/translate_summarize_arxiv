    "data obtained by hades collaboration  @xcite show that doubly strange @xmath0 hyperon can be produced in nuclear collisions at energies well below the production threshold for nucleon - nucleon collisions . in ar+kcl collisions at @xmath1  @xmath2gev the observed ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath3 multiplicities is @xmath4 , and",
    "some @xmath0 s are also seen in au+au collisions at 1.23  @xmath2gev . statistical model with canonical suppression of strangeness production predicts a value of the order @xmath5 for the ratio .",
    "the colliding nuclei with the atomic number @xmath2 have usually different number of protons ( @xmath6 ) and neutrons ( @xmath7 ) and thereby the matter created in their collisions has a non - zero total isospin projections quantified by the asymmetry coefficient @xmath8 being different from one . in our calculations",
    "we assume that this asymmetry is reflected in the observed multiplicities of hadrons belonging to one isospin multiplet , e.g , @xmath9 for the ar+kcl collisions we have @xmath10 .",
    "we can use the relations ( [ e : iso ] ) to determine the total amount of produced @xmath11 quark pairs ( distributed among hadrons ) . in a baryon - rich environment , created in collisions at sis energies ,",
    "the @xmath12 antiquarks can only be accommodated in kaons .",
    "furthermore , under such conditions kaons do not find partners for inelastic scattering and once produced they are guaranteed to leave the system .",
    "thus the number of @xmath11 pairs can be reconstructed as @xmath13 once the numbers of produced @xmath14 and @xmath15 quarks are known we assume in our minimal statistical model  @xcite that the @xmath14 quarks are distributed among strange hadrons ( anti - kaons and hyperons ) with relative abundances determined by thermal and chemical equilibria and by the strangeness conservation . for our analysis",
    "we use the ratios which formally do not depend on the produced strangeness  @xcite @xmath16 these ratios has the same total number of strange an anti - strange quarks in both numerator and denominator .",
    "at subthreshold energies no strange particles are created in incident nucleon - nucleon collisions and all strangeness must be produced _ during _ the evolution of the hot fireball created in the collision .",
    "creation of strangeness is a very rare event , with @xmath17 multiplicity @xmath18 the amount of @xmath11 pairs is thus far below the saturation and can be treated perturbatively .",
    "it will not only scale with the volume , but also we can assume that it will steadily grow with time . if  for simplicity  we assume ideal hydrodynamics , then the only length scale is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the fireball volume , and it must determine also the lifetime  @xcite . at fixed impact parameter , the probability of creating one @xmath11 pair is given as @xmath21 for a fixed volume @xmath20 , the probability to have @xmath22 of the @xmath11 pairs is poissonian @xmath23    the hades data have been obtained after averaging over collisions with different centralities . the dependence on @xmath24 in  ( [ e : wv ] ) makes the averaging non - trivial .",
    "if we denote the centrality averaging by angle brackets , @xmath25 , we can relate the parameter @xmath26 to the measured kaon multiplicity as follows @xmath27    in the minimal statistical model we assume that in an event with volume @xmath20 and @xmath22 pairs of @xmath11 quarks , the @xmath14 quarks are distributed into hadrons according to the probability @xmath28 this is the probability to find hadron @xmath29 with the mass @xmath30 , baryon number @xmath31 and strangeness content @xmath32 .",
    "the chemical potential is determined by the fireball freeze - out density taken @xmath33 , where @xmath34@xmath35 is the nuclear saturation density .",
    "the probability ( [ e : pa ] ) is normalised  for each @xmath22 separately  by the factor @xmath36 .    in total , average multiplicity of hadron species @xmath29",
    "is then given by the sum @xmath37 where the r.h.s .",
    "lists all contributions to the average multiplicity from events with one , two , three , etc .",
    "@xmath11 pairs .",
    "note that @xmath38 is understood as the number of hadrons @xmath29 produced in events with @xmath22 @xmath11 pairs , divided by the number of all events .",
    "these multiplicities are determined with the help of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath0 hyperons , caring two @xmath14 quarks , are produced only in events with two and more @xmath11 pairs .",
    "our result for the @xmath0 multiplicity ratio is @xmath41 in the pre - factor we collected the modifications with respect to the `` usual '' statistical model with the canonical suppression .",
    "this and all other calculated ratios are displayed in fig .",
    "[ f : rats ] by dashed lines as functions of temperature .",
    "we see that the calculated @xmath42 is clearly below the measured error band .",
    "multiplicity ratios as functions of the temperature .",
    "red dotted lines with purple bands show the measured data values  ( [ e : data ] ) .",
    "dashed lines are minimal statistical model predictions according to  ( [ e : ratio ] ) .",
    "solid lines are predictions with in - medium potentials included . for the @xmath43 ratio",
    "we show results with two values of @xmath44 optical potential acting on @xmath45 : @xmath46 and @xmath47  mev ( other curves are calculated with @xmath46  mev ) .",
    "dash - doubly - dotted curves show ratios with only nucleon potentials included .",
    ", scaledwidth=95.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ f : rats ] we also revised the data on @xmath48 ratio based on the actual isospin ratio from  ( [ e : iso ] ) , see  @xcite .    by trying to improve the agreement of our calculations with the data we have introduced density - dependent scalar and vector potentials @xmath49 and @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "they modify the statistical distribution function by replacing the dispersion relation to @xmath51 .",
    "the chosen values were @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "the scalar potentials for strange particles follow from the relation @xmath54 , where we use @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 or @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this leads to changes in our theoretical results which allow to explain @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath48 ratios by one freeze - out temperature @xmath63mev .",
    "however , the changes are not large enough to bring the @xmath64 ratio into agreement with the measured data .",
    "it is interesting that accounting for the trigger on central collisions actually makes the disagreement even bigger .",
    "the culprit is in the volume factors which _ reduce _ the overall result when selection on larger volumes is made .",
    "although the model disagrees with the ar+kcl data , for curiosity we can make a prediction also for the au+au collisions recently recorded by hades . as seen from fig .",
    "[ f : rats ] , the temperature dependence of @xmath65 is very weak .",
    "the crucial difference to the smaller system is in the volume which is almost five times bigger for au+au than for ar+kcl . as the ratio ( [ e : ratio ] )",
    "is proportional to @xmath66 , we expect that it will be five - times smaller in gold - induced reactions than in ar+kcl .",
    "below the strangeness production threshold this statement is independent of the collision energy .",
    "in comparison to the canonical statistical model , the minimal statistical model assumes that strangeness must be produced during the fireball evolution and takes into account the proper scaling of rare species multiplicity with the volume .",
    "this leads to non - trivial differences between the two models and the result of the minimal statistical model on centrality - averaged multiplicities depends on a set of averaged volume factors .    in any case",
    ", the conclusion we could draw from our study is that cascade production is non - statistical .",
    "we speculate that it might be caused by immediate decoupling of the produced @xmath0 s from the bulk matter . at an early hot stage",
    "some @xmath0 s are produced which are later not annihilated at lower temperature .",
    "those particles chemically decouple from the system .",
    "we speculate that the most viable for such a production of @xmath0 would be the strangeness recombination reactions , either involving @xmath44 and a hyperon , or two hyperons .",
    "note that we have provided parametrised cross - sections for such reactions in @xcite .",
    "an interesting options appears in the @xmath67 channel , which in vacuum has a high reaction threshold of 1609  mev . due to",
    "effective lowering of kaon mass in the baryon - rich environment it can decrease so that eventually it hits the @xmath68 resonance around 1530  mev .",
    "this could increase the cross section for @xmath0 production considerably .",
    "kinetic calculations aiming the the validation of these mechanisms are planned for the near future .",
    "this work was partially supported by apvv-0050 - 11 , vega 1/0469/15 ( slovakia ) and mmt grant lg13031 ( czech republic ) .",
