    "<S> thin film heterostructures provide a powerful means to study the antagonism between superconductivity ( sc ) and ferromagnetism ( fm ) . one interesting issue in fm - sc hybrids which defies </S>",
    "<S> the notion of antagonistic orders is the observation of magnetic field induced superconductivity ( fis ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that in systems where the fm domains / islands produce spatial inhomogeneities of the sc order parameter , the fis can derive significant contribution from different mobilities of the magnetic flux identified by two distinct critical states in the inhomogeneous superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments on nanoengineered bilayers of ferromagnetic copt and superconducting nbn where copt / nbn islands are separated by a granular nbn , lend support to this alternative explanation of fis in certain class of fm - sc hybrids .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1.5 cm    the pinning of magnetic flux lines in a superconducting ( sc ) film by ferromagnetic ( fm ) dots and multidomain magnetic films has been a topic of considerable interest @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important consequence of the inhomogeneous magnetic field produced by such structures is the formation of a local field - free state when the fm - sc hybrid is placed in an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this effect has been variously called as field - enhanced superconductivity @xcite , magnetization controlled superconductivity @xcite and domain wall superconductivity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> earlier studies of fm - sc hybrids have been carried out mostly on films of elemental superconductor such as nb and pb deposited on in - plane as well as high coercivity perpendicular anisotropy media @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although striking field - induced changes in the critical temperature ( t@xmath0 ) of the superconductor have been seen , the field - free regions produced by the dipolar field of fm dots are not homogeneous in these systems . also , it is not clear whether superconductivity actually survives in areas above ( or below ) the dots because of the small upper critical field ( h@xmath1 ) of the elemental superconductors and strong magnetization of the dots . </S>",
    "<S> the global superconducting order parameter in these fm - sc hybrids is clearly inhomogeneous irrespective of the orientation of magnetization in the dots . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore , important to address the possible role of granularity in causing the fis in such systems . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of this issue becomes apparent from the richness of the field - temperature ( h - t ) phase diagram of well - known granular systems such as composite films @xcite , high t@xmath0 ceramics @xcite and josephson - junction arrays @xcite .    in this report </S>",
    "<S> we address field - induced superconductivity in nanoengineered grids of copt / nbn where the copt - free regions have been made granular , with a reduced t@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of using nbn is in its large h@xmath1 ( @xmath2 250 koe ) which prohibits a significant perturbation of superconductivity by the copt . </S>",
    "<S> the resistance ( r ) of the nanoengineered structures has been measured with current density j @xmath3 j@xmath0 as a function of external field @xmath4 applied in two different orientations ; ( i ) ( @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 ) @xmath5 @xmath7 , and ( ii ) , ( @xmath4 @xmath8 @xmath6 ) @xmath5 @xmath7 , where @xmath7 is a unit vector normal to the plane of the film . </S>",
    "<S> the r vs. h loops are hysteretic with their reverse branch showing entry into the superconducting state at fields much higher than the field at which r appears in the forward branch . </S>",
    "<S> this fis state is shown to be a consequence of the granularity of magnetic and superconducting order parameters in the hybrid .    </S>",
    "<S> thin film bilayers of copt and nbn each 50 nm thick , were deposited on ( 001 ) mgo at 600 @xmath9c using pulsed laser ablation of copt and nb targets respectively </S>",
    "<S> . further details of the deposition of nbn and copt films are given elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bilayer film was first patterned with standard lithography and then ar@xmath10 ion milled into a 100 @xmath11m@xmath12500 @xmath11 m bridge as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the top copt layer was then structured in simple square patterns using a ga@xmath13 focused ion beam ( fib ) milling facility . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) shows a typical scanning electron micrograph of the patterned bilayer . </S>",
    "<S> the size of each copt element in the pattern is 0.5@xmath120.5 @xmath11m@xmath14 with 50 nm spacing in between . </S>",
    "<S> the active area of the sample on which transport measurements were carried out contains 10@xmath12210 square elements .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic domain structure of the copt squares was probed with magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) and atomic force microscopy ( afm ) performed simultaneously on a thermally demagnetized sample in the tapping mode at various lift heights . </S>",
    "<S> a commercial magnetometer was used for measurement of magnetization . the critical current density ( j@xmath0 ) , </S>",
    "<S> resistance r ( t ) and magnetoresistance r ( h ) were measured between 5 and 20 k.    since the central result of this paper is based on inhomogeneities of the sc and fm order parameters , we first establish these inhomogeneities in the patterned sample . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 presents r ( t ) of the patterned as well as unpatterned bilayer . </S>",
    "<S> while the latter film shows a sharp transition ( @xmath15 t @xmath16 0.5 k ) with t@xmath0 onset at @xmath16 15.3 k , the r ( t ) of the patterned film exhibits a two step structure - where the first drop in resistance occurs at @xmath16 15.1 k in which r decreases by @xmath16 60 @xmath17 of its normal state value . </S>",
    "<S> the second transition starts at @xmath16 13 k , culminating in r = 0 at @xmath16 11.8 k. the change from single - step to two - step transition on nanostructuring is presumably a result of ga@xmath13 ion damage . </S>",
    "<S> this feature , however , provides the unique advantage of addressing fis in a granular medium . </S>",
    "<S> inset of fig . 2 compares the j@xmath0 ( t ) of the nanostructured and a plane bilayer film . </S>",
    "<S> the j@xmath0 of the unpatterned film quickly reaches the limit of our measurement which is set by the width of the bridge and maximum current used ( @xmath16 100 ma ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , a pronounced reduction in the j@xmath0 is seen on nanopatterning . </S>",
    "<S> since the capacity of such structures to carry dissipation - less current is determined by their low t@xmath0 links , a suppressed growth of j@xmath0 on lowering the temperature indicates that the channels of nbn connecting copt / nbn islands are granular .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 also shows magnetization ( m ) of an unpatterned bilayer at 5 and 20 k as a function of magnetic field applied along the surface of the film . </S>",
    "<S> the square hysteresis loop of low coercivity ( @xmath16 250 oe ) at 20 k seen here suggests a soft ferromagnetic state in copt with in - plane @xmath18 , a characteristic feature of the disordered fcc phase of copt @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the m - h curve traced at 5 k is dominated by the diamagnetic response of the nbn layer . while it was not possible to measure the magnetic state of the patterned film with squid magnetometry </S>",
    "<S> , we have used room temperature mfm to visualize domain structure of the copt islands . fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) and ( d ) show the afm and mfm micrographs respectively , taken from the same spot on the film @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bright and dark features in mfm represent domains of reversed @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> since each patterned copt island has two such domains , it is clear that they are in a thermally demagnetized state .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , we show a set of r ( h ) data for the nanostructured film at several t / t@xmath0 , where t@xmath0 is the temperature ( @xmath16 11.8 k ) at which zero - resistance state is reached . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field applied in the plane of the film and orthogonal to current in these measurements , was scanned in units of koe following the cycle 0 @xmath19 3.5 @xmath19 0 @xmath19 - 3.5 @xmath19 0 . a constant current density of 1@xmath1210@xmath20 a / cm@xmath14 , which corresponds to the j@xmath0 at 9.8 k ( t / t@xmath0 = 0.83 ) was used for resistance measurements . at small t </S>",
    "<S> / t@xmath0 (= 0.79 ) , the r first remains zero with the increasing field . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected as the zero - field current density j is smaller than the j@xmath0 at this t / t@xmath0 . however , as the field increases , j@xmath0 drops and at h = h@xmath22 ( marked in the figure ) , the j becomes larger than j@xmath0 and the sample goes in a dissipative state . here </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of r is linear on h , as expected in the flux flow regime of the mixed state . </S>",
    "<S> on reversing the field , however , the resistance drops to zero much faster . </S>",
    "<S> the dissipation - less state appears at a higher field h ( @xmath2 h@xmath22 ) in the reverse branch of the loop . </S>",
    "<S> a similar hysteretic behavior is seen at the higher values of t / t@xmath0 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( h ) we show the result of a similar measurement performed on an unpatterned bilayer . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the r vs. h curve is completely reversible . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from these measurements that the hysteretic behavior of r vs. h is a consequence of the nano - patterning . </S>",
    "<S> this is the central result of our paper .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) and ( b ) we summarize these observations of a field - assisted reentrant superconducting state in terms of h - t phase diagram . fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) shows a sketch of the r - h curve whose critical points have been marked by letters a , b , c , d , e and f. the point a corresponds to h@xmath22 where superconductivity disappears on ramping up the field , point b denotes the maximum applied field and point c is where superconductivity reappears on reducing the field from its maximum value . similarly , points d and f mark destruction and reappearance of sc on the reverse branch of the loop while e corresponds to the maximum negative field . </S>",
    "<S> the contours of the points c and d as a function of temperature are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) , and the shaded area enclosed by them is the range of field where global superconductivity exists while scanning it from + h@xmath23 to - h@xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) is the phase space of superconductivity for - h@xmath23 to + h@xmath23 excursion .    before attempting to put forward a model which would allow us to understand the results of fig . 3 and 4 </S>",
    "<S> , it is important to point out that for our film of thickness d ( @xmath16 50 nm ) much smaller than the penetration depth @xmath24 ( @xmath16 200 - 250 nm ) placed in a parallel field , a large contribution to dissipation may come from orbital and pauli pair - breaking processes , in addition to the dissipation due to flux flow . </S>",
    "<S> however , the pair breaking processes are not hysteretic . </S>",
    "<S> the misalignment of the magnetic field away from a true parallel configuration is also an important issue because the parasitic out - of - plane component of the field can lead to nucleation of perpendicular vortices . to rule out this possibility , </S>",
    "<S> we had aligned the field parallel to the plane of the film with a precision of @xmath25 0.1 degree using a specially built experimental setup @xcite .    a correct model for understanding the phase diagram of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 must take into account two important features of the nano - structured sample ; first , it has a periodic granularity . </S>",
    "<S> the copt - nbn squares become superconducting at @xmath16 15.1 k , but a long - range phase coherence develops only when the copt - free grids go superconducting at @xmath16 11.8 k. the patterned film therefore is characterized by two distinct critical current densities , a large j@xmath26 inside the nbn - copt squares and a much weaker j@xmath27 in the channels separating these squares . secondly </S>",
    "<S> , the copt islands have in - plane @xmath18 with coercive field @xmath16 250 oe ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) which has been marked by a pair of horizontal lines in the phase diagram of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that in most of the phase space , the copt islands are saturated with their @xmath18 @xmath8 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a qualitative understanding of the flux distribution can be made from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(a ) and ( c ) drawn for ( @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 ) @xmath5 @xmath7 and ( @xmath4 @xmath8 @xmath6 ) @xmath5 @xmath7 configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that even when copt squares are flux coupled at h @xmath2 h@xmath0 , some fringing field from the edges of the squares produces flux lines of opposite polarity in the nbn channels . </S>",
    "<S> these are marked by open circles and crosses in the top view of the square array . </S>",
    "<S> the flux due to external magnetic field has a different distribution in the channels and the copt covered nbn squares because of their different j@xmath0 s . </S>",
    "<S> it can be understood in the framework of the two - level critical state model of ji , rzchowski , anand , and tinkham @xcite . using this model we can define two types of fluxons ; ( i ) those pinned by pinning centers in the square ( @xmath28@xmath29 ) , and ( ii ) , the fluxons that are confined to the channels and are free to move due to weak pinning ( @xmath28@xmath30 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the external field is increased , fluxons enter the channels first , supersaturating them and leading to the increase of dissipation along a - b branch of the curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the flux eventually enters the squares where it is pinned . on decreasing the field , </S>",
    "<S> the free flux ( @xmath28@xmath30 ) leaks out from the channels to such an extent that the zero resistance state is reestablished along the low resistance paths marked in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 at a higher value of the external field . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible because there is a large pinned flux ( @xmath28@xmath29 ) in the nbn squares .    </S>",
    "<S> we expect that in the @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 configuration ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(a ) ) , the current flow along the channels ( paths which do not cross copt - nbn squares ) remain dissipative due to the dipolar field of copt . </S>",
    "<S> this is where the magnetization of copt plays an explicit role . </S>",
    "<S> a similar scenario also explains reentrant superconductivity seen for the @xmath4 @xmath8 @xmath6 configuration sketched at the left bottom panel ( c ) of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . a typical set of r vs. h data taken at t / t@xmath0 = 0.85 in @xmath4 @xmath8 @xmath6 configuration </S>",
    "<S> is shown in panel ( d ) of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . </S>",
    "<S> the granular nbn channels although form a continuous path for the flow of current for @xmath4 @xmath8 @xmath6 , the cores of vortices , which are already large due to a small order parameter in the channels , start overlapping , and even at low fields , the channels become resistive . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of resistance here has nothing to do with vortex motion under lorentz force . </S>",
    "<S> this type of force - free dissipation has been seen in granular films of nbn @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the observations made in the present study have important repercussions on the phenomenon of field assisted superconductivity seen in fm - sc bilayers @xcite , trilayers @xcite and dot structures @xcite . while </S>",
    "<S> in the case of fm - sc - fm trilayer structures placed in an in - plane field , no inhomogeneity of the order parameter is introduced as long as each fm layer behaves like a single domain film , the same is unavoidable in bilayers at field h @xmath31 h@xmath0 and in dot arrays even beyond saturation . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that in such systems the repercussions of the two - level critical state model warrant consideration .    </S>",
