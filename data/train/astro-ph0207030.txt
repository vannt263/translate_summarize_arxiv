    "cataclysmic variable ( cv ) stars are interacting binary systems in which a late - type secondary star overflows its roche lobe and accretes matter onto a compact primary . amongst these",
    ", the nova - like variables are defined as those that persist in a high mass - accretion rate .",
    "a result of such a heterogeneous label is that , amongst the nova - like variables , there are many objects that , displaying similarities to members of other cv classes , sit uneasily with their classification . in this paper",
    "we present high time - resolution uv spectroscopy of one such example  qu car .    at @xmath7 ,",
    "qu car is one of the brightest known cv , so it is rather surprising that until now it has been mostly ignored in observational studies . from among the small number of hitherto published studies , gilliland & phillips examined optical spectra ( 43004800 ) at time - resolutions down to 3 minutes .",
    "they derived a long period ( 109 ) from radial velocity variations in the optical emission lines .",
    "they also made note of the relative weakness of the balmer line emission , which they deemed due to a high temperature and high mass accretion rate in the disc and suggested a classification of old nova or nova - like variable  a view in keeping with schild s ( 1969 ) comment that the object displayed some characteristics indicative of an old nova . since this time , qu car has been classified in catalogues ( ritter & kolb 1998 , downes et al .",
    "2001 ) as a nova - like variable .",

    "( _ iue _ ) low - dispersion spectra reveal broad blueshifted uv absorption lines in n  and c , with an emission component in c  and he  ( knigge , woods & drew 1994 ) , indicative of an optically thick disc accompanied by mass outflow .",
    "knigge et al .",
    "( 1994 ) noted variation in the c  line caused by a periodic increase in the strength of the emission component , but were unable to decide whether this variablity was linked to the orbital phase .",
    "they also commented on the strength of the o@xmath11371 absorption line and the he@xmath11640 emission  both unusually strong for high - state non - magnetic cv ( hnmcv ) .",
    "the data that are analysed in this paper were obtained as part of an observing campaign to detect spectral signatures of disc - wind variability of short timescales .",
    "these signatures are predicted to show up as highly time - variable fine structure components in wind - formed uv lines ( proga , stone & drew 1998 ) . to achieve the necessary time and wavelenght resolution , the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) was employed with an echelle grating in photon - counting ( time - tag ) mode .",
    "this allows a time - resolution of down to @xmath8s and velocity resolution of down to @xmath9 , with the trade - off that higher time - resolution will result in a reduced useable spectral resolution and vice - versa .    on examining the results of the _ hst _ observations",
    "we were struck by the ways in which qu car distinguished itself from the other targets in the programme ( the nova - like variables ix vel and v3885 sgr , presented in hartley et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this paper",
    "we seek to present the current _ hst _ observations and then re - examine archive data , with a view to establishing a physical origin for the unusual features noted . in section [ s : obs ] we describe the observations and data extraction processes .",
    "the results are then presented in two ways : in section [ s : mean ] we describe the time - averaged spectrum obtained at each epoch of observation , then in section [ s : timevar ] we re - present the data as spectral time - series at 30-sec time - resolution and as continuum light curves . finally , in section [ s : discuss ] we complare qu  car with other non - magnetic hnmcv and consider the origin of qu  car s uv line spectrum .",
    "observations were performed by the stis instrument on the _ hst _ with the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) mama detector ( 11401735 ) .",
    "the e140 m echelle grating with a central wavelength of 1425was used .",
    "this configuration provides a resolution of @xmath10 ( r @xmath0 23000 ) .",
    "each observation was performed in a single telescope orbit for the maximum available time , with the detector set to time - tag mode and using the 0.2@xmath11aperture .",
    "the dates and exposure lengths of our observations are given in table [ tab : obs_dates ] .",
    "[ tab : obs_dates ]    .the observation dates and times for each observing run [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "an analysis of time - variability of the strong lines during each observation is presented in this section . the n@xmath11240 , o@xmath11371 , si@xmath11398 and c@xmath11549 lines are displayed as trailed mean - subtracted spectra , as trailed normalized spectra and as 1d averages of the first and the second half of the 2600-sec observation . in the trailed spectra",
    "we include only observations q2 and q3 , as q1 displays no sign of time variability during our observation ( see below ) .    to reduce the prominence of noise in the trailed spectra , the 1d spectra were first smoothed by convolution with a gaussian function of sigma , @xmath13  ( 10 pixels ) .",
    "the spectra were then normalized by fitting a 4th order chebyshev function to the time - averaged data ; the fit was checked to assure that it did not produce strong curvature in the vicinity of the spectral lines .",
    "all time - resolved spectra were divided by this continuum fit and then renormalized to ensure a continuum level of 1 .",
    "the mean - subtracted spectra were prepared for plotting by subtracting the normalized time - averaged spectrum from each time - bin s normalized spectrum .",
    "the q2 trailed spectra are presented in figure [ fig : gr2 ] . in n  a dark broad ( @xmath14across ) feature shifts steadily to the red by about 500 .",
    "examining the 1d spectra for the first and the second half of the observation separately , it becomes clear that this is due to a redwards shift in the entire absorption profile .",
    "this is too large to be accounted for by a radial velocity shift due to wd orbital motion , if the orbital parameters derived by gilliland and phillips ( 1982 ) are accepted .",
    "a similarly broad dark feature is also seen in the si  and otrailed spectra .",
    "however , compared to n  the shift is more abrupt at around the midpoint of the observation , fliping from blue to red in the space of less than 500 sec .",
    "again , this feature represents a shift in the entire absorption profile from blue to red .",
    "along with the redward shift there is also an alteration in the form of the o  and si  profiles , with the bluemost absorption wing becoming weaker and possibly even slightly emissive in si . if more subtly , the c  line appears to shift redwards in the same way as the n  line",
    "also , its broad redshifted emission component weakens slightly during the observation .",
    "no variation is detected in either the c@xmath11176 or he@xmath11640 lines .    in the q3 trailed spectra ( figure  [ fig : gr3 ] )",
    "there appears to be a velocity - shifting component to the line profiles : in the n , si  and c  lines a dark feature ( @xmath0200wide ) shifts gradually redwards by @xmath15and then more sharply bluewards around the midpoint of the observation ; this component then resumes its redwards shift , creating a ` sawtooth ' pattern .",
    "as this variation occurs , the redward edge of these line profiles is very nearly stationary ( see the lower panels in fig .  [",
    "fig : gr3 ] ) .",
    "there is at most just a hint of the same behaviour in the o  line profile  the most obvious change is a slight weakening and narrowing of the absorption as a whole for about 300  sec centred on 1000  sec after the start of the observation .",
    "again , the c  and he   lines do not vary noticeably .",
    "q3 does reward with some sporadic , shorter timescale variablity . in the n  and o  trailed spectra",
    "there is a broadening of the absorption , appearing first in the red wing at around 1150  sec and then switching into the blue wing , finishing at about 1600sec . in",
    "the c  trailed spectrum , just the beginning of this change affecting the red wing of the line is detectable .",
    "there may also be a weaker event of the same kind at about 600  sec after the start , that again shows in the n  and o  profiles .",
    "the variability seen in q2 and q3 is quite different . in q2",
    ", there appears to be a shift in the gross line profiles accompanied by a small change in the steepness of the blue absorption edge .",
    "in q3 the blue absorption edge shifts further to the blue , yielding an increase in the width of the line profile and only in this dataset is there any apparent variation on the @xmath16  sec timescale . in q3 , where line emission is generally more prominent , the variability persists as an attribute of the absorption line spectrum .",
    "the lack of variabilty in observation q1 is interesting as in the mean spectrum it bears a stronger resemblance to q3 than the more variable q2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gr1 ] shows the q1 trailed data for si@xmath11398 , the most variable of the transitions observed at this time .",
    "there is just a trace of the velocity - shifting component that is seen in the q3 si  line . in the q1 n  line profile",
    "there is a weak component of broad blueshifted absorption , signalling the presence of an outflow ( see section [ s : mean ] ) . at the time of the q3 observation",
    "there was no such evidence of outflow .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this anticorrelation is a persistent and hence significant effect .    in order to examine the data for continuum variability we plotted light - curves ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) of flux summed over the 14501500wavelength range , with time - binning of 20s for each dataset .",
    "there is a similar contrast in the degree of continuum variability as that seen in the line profiles : q1 exhibits almost no variability ; q2 shows some brightness change , dimming slightly towards the middle of the observation , and then recovering ; finally , the lightcurve for q3 has the most chaotic appearance of the three .",
    "the power spectrum was calculated for each of the three time series  in none was there evidence of any preferred periods of variation .",
    "the detected uv light variation has an amplitude of around 10 per cent .",
    "this is consistent with optical estimates of photometric variability .",
    "schild reported optical brightness fluctuations of up to 0.2mag on a timescale of 90sec .",
    "similarly gilliland and phillips ( 1982 ) and kern & bookmyer ( 1986 ) presented photometric data showing variations of 0.10.2mag on timescales of a few minutes .",
    "to set the characteristics of our high - quality _ hst _ uv spectra of qu car in a broader context , we retrieved the 15 low - dispersion ( @xmath17 ) 11501975  spectra available from the _ iue _ archive .",
    "these data are provided pre - calibrated in the newsips format and was extracted via the iuesips software run under iraf .",
    "the continuum flux level of our _ hst _ data is consistent with , but at the high end of that recorded in previous _ iue _",
    "observations in which it varies from a minimum of @xmath18 to maximum of @xmath19(cf table  [ tab : cont ] ) .",
    "the _ iue _",
    "observations yield , on average , a slightly flatter dereddened continuum slope ( @xmath20 ) than do the _ hst _ data ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "as regards the spectral line behaviour , in contrast to the _ iue _ data , the hst / stis observations have caught qu car at times when its c@xmath11549 line presents with almost no blueshifted absorption . in all but three of the _ iue _",
    "spectra there is a significant blueshifted absorption component to the c  line , extending to between @xmath22 and @xmath23of line centre .",
    "if this is taken to be the terminal velocity of an outflow , then this is relatively modest , compared to other cv , such as ix  vel and v3885  sgr ( hartley et al . 2002 ) where the c  line shows evidence of outflows up to at least 5000 . in n@xmath11240 , there is always a blueshifted absorption component .",
    "the proximity of the damped ly@xmath24 absorption may render this line less suitable , at the low resolution of the _ iue _  low dispersion mode for a determination of typical maximum outflow speed .",
    "nevertheless , measurement of the collected _ iue _  data and the q1 _ hst _  observation ( figure 2 ) indicate that the maximum blueshift in the n  line generally matches that in c.    figure  [ fig : iue ] shows dataset q1 downgraded to _ iue _ resolution and overplotted on merged short - wavelength _ iue _ data for 1981 december 7 ( swp15670 , swp15671 ) , selected for being most similar to the _ hst _ sets , and merged data from 1991 june 26/27 ( swp51925 - 30 ) , selected for showing much better developed wind signatures .",
    "we note that the he  emission is somewhat stronger in the _ hst _ sets than in all _ iue _ observations .",
    "the o@xmath11371 line is present as a clear absorption feature in all uv spectra obtained to date .",
    "putting all the available uv data together , there is no evidence that the equivalent width of the blueshifted absorption in the c  and n  lines changes systematically with e.g. uv continuum brightness .",
    "knigge et al .",
    "( 1994 ) provide further discussion of variability in the _ iue _  data .",
    "apart from the tendency for clearer wind signatures in the n  and c  line profiles to appear in the _ iue _ data ( particularly those from the epoch studied by knigge et al .",
    "1994 ) , there is strong consistency between these older observations and the new _ hst _  data . encouraged by this , we can now turn to a summary discussion of what the higher - quality _ hst _ observations of qu  car have revealed to us about this highly - ionised compact binary .",
    "in this paper we have presented high time- and high spectral - resolution uv spectra of qu car obtained at three epochs .",
    "these data have pointed toward a higher than typical degree of ionization , and reveal a mix of fairly narrow , emission and absorption line features along with only modest evidence of mass loss .    before considering the physical implications of the new spectroscopy , we review the constraints on the inclination of qu  car .",
    "gilliland & phillips proposed @xmath25 from the lack of orbital modulation in the binary s light curve and the relatively narrow optical emission features .",
    "the uv emission lines are not particularly broad either , generally fitting within approximately @xmath26 . the simple fact that a number of uv spectral lines are firmly in absorption , and that broadened blueshifted absorption is detected from time to time ,",
    "also reinforces the case for low inclination in that line emission is accepted as the general pattern for high - state high inclination systems .",
    "we can venture a little further than this and note that the observed mix of emission and absorption lines argues persuasively against re - classifying qu  car as a magnetic system ( see warner 1995 )  a step that might otherwise be contemplated on the grounds of the strong he@xmath11640 emission typifying this object .",
    "we now compare the 11501660    spectrum of qu car with those of more typical high - state non - magnetic cv in order to make the case that qu  car is extreme in terms of the apparent degree of ionization .",
    "we choose as our comparison objects ss  cyg near peak of outburst and ix  vel , for the reason that similarly high quality _ hst _",
    "uv spectra have been obtained for them .",
    "ix  vel and ss  cyg are also non - eclipsing systems , like qu  car .",
    "the ss  cyg observations used ( z3dv0104 t and z3dv0105 t ) were obtained by one of us ( ksl ) and , to ensure the most up - to - date calibration , were retrieved from the mast facility at stsci .",
    "the ix  vel observations were presented in hartley et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "the spectra of these three sources are shown together in figure  [ fig : comp ] .",
    "the three objects are placed in a sequence of increasing degree of ionization , with ix  vel the least - ionized , qu  car the most ionized and ss  cyg somewhere in between .",
    "this assessment is based largely on how the he@xmath11640 and o@xmath11371 line profiles compare with c@xmath11549  these signatures of high excitation are indeed relatively strongest in qu car .",
    "anther point of contrast between qu  car and the other two systems concerns the broad absorption dips at @xmath01300    and @xmath01340   .",
    "these are presumably due to disc atmospheric blanketing .",
    "wade & hubeny ( 1998 ) show in their disc atmosphere models that these features would be expected to fade as the maximum disc temperature rises ( see their figure 9 ) . that this happens to at least the @xmath01300    feature",
    "is consistent with the probable identification of much of the blend with modest - to - low ionization si  iii / o  i transitions .",
    "the pattern in figure  [ fig : comp ] is that ix  vel presents with the highest equivalent width in these dips , ss  cyg is intermediate , whilst they are completely absent from qu  car .",
    "this trend operates in the same sense as the rise in relative prominence of the o  and he  lines .",
    "two final points of interest with regard to figure  [ fig : comp ] are the larger number of interstellar lines in the spectrum of qu  car compared to either ix  vel or ss  cyg , and the appearance of both the c@xmath11176 and c@xmath11335 lines in emission in qu  car ( albeit with a superposed absorption component in the former ) .",
    "the relatively rich interstellar line spectrum has to do with the greater distance to qu  car .",
    "this is estimated to be at least @xmath27pc ( gilliland & phillips 1982 ) , compared to @xmath28pc and @xmath29pc , from astrometric parallaxes , for ix vel ( _ hipparcos _ ) and ss  cyg ( harrison et al . 2001 ) , respectively .",
    "the seeming predeliction for carbon line emission may be due to a carbon over - abundance in the emission line gas .",
    "both the question of the distance to qu  car and the abundances issue are focused on in a separate study ( drew et al .",
    "2002 ) .    although wind signatures are scarcely apparent in the qu  car spectrum shown in figure  [ fig : comp ] , the comparison with archive _ iue _  data ( section  [ s : mag ] ) showed that they have been more apparent at other epochs .",
    "however there is a clear point of contrast with objects like ss  cyg and ix  vel with regard to the maximum outflow velocities observed . in qu",
    "car they are usually about 2000  , whilst in both ss  cyg and ix  vel this is in the region of 4000  .",
    "this higher figure is indeed typical of hnmcv ( see e.g. prinja & rosen 1995 ) . very crudely , if it is assumed these speeds scale as the rotation speeds in the accretion disc where presumably the wind is launched , this factor of 2 difference may be viewed as implying a substantially larger launch radius in qu  car  perhaps up to a factor of 4 larger .",
    "quantitatively this conclusion is somewhat dependent on both the binary inclination and accretor mass  qualitatively it will be hard to avoid .",
    "its implication , like the impression of relatively high ionization , is a higher than typical mass accretion rate .    in the above",
    "we have assumed that the uv continuum emission in qu  car is dominated by disc accretion .",
    "this seems uncontroversial given the similarity between the slope of its dereddened energy distribution and that of indisputably accretion - dominated hnmcv ( see section  [ s : mean ] ) .",
    "it is likely that all absorption features , including those seen superposed on the c , c  and heemission profiles , form in the disc atmosphere .",
    "this view is supported by the way in which the pattern of variability seen in nand si  absorption during the q3 observation is also apparent in the c  absorption component .",
    "the less variable he  absorption component can be viewed as mimicking the less variable oprofile .",
    "we now consider the likely origin of the line emission . figure  [ fig : c ] shows the emission , from the three ionization stages of carbon present in the spectrum , plotted on a common velocity scale .",
    "the c  line is clearly the narrowest with a hwzi of order 600 .",
    "the hwzis in the c  and c  lines are not so easy to tell apart . on fitting a single gaussian through the line wings we find that the fwhm , respectively for these two lines , is @xmath0950and @xmath01100 .",
    "these figures translate to hwzis of @xmath01200 and @xmath01400 .",
    "we do not correct for intrinsic multiplet splitting because the magnitude of the correction depends on the unknown flux ratios among the multiplet components .",
    "fortunately these splittings are not so large that correction for them would alter the basic finding  namely , that broader emission is associated with higher ionization .",
    "the near equality of the c  and c  emission widths probably indicates that the excited c  line contains a substantial contribution from recombination .    to see all three carbon ion stages simultaneously , with this pattern of velocity widths probably points to an origin in a disc ` chromosphere '",
    "this might be created by irradiation from the euv - bright inner disc and accreting object .",
    "emission produced by an outflow from the accretor or the innermost disc is rendered less likely by the modest ionization of the c  and c  lines ( with the emissive flux in the c  line only a little less than that in c ) .",
    "since the emission component in each of the c , c  and he  lines is broader than the superposed absorption , we would have to refer to a specific kinematic model for the system to position the emission line region relative to the absorption line region . in the absence of this",
    ", we can not distinguish whether the line emission is optically thin and overlies the source of line absorption , or whether it comes from a different part of the disc .",
    "the emergent picture of qu  car is then that it is relatively highly - ionized compared to the more typical properties of hnmcv .",
    "the narrowness of the uv spectral lines observed may have to do with their production at larger disc radii than usual . of course we can not yet rule out the possibility that qu  car might be oriented nearly pole on .",
    "we have to leave as an unsolved mystery the origin of the short - term variability within the spectral line profiles ( section  [ s : timevar ] ) that has been revealed thanks to the hst / stis time - tag mode of data - taking . since this variability is not present at all epochs and indeed presents with different properties on the two occasions we have noticed it , it is unlikely to be connected to anything as fundamental as the binary orbit .",
    "our third set of data hints at a repetition timescale of around an hour if , that is , the detected absorption profile disturbances do in fact repeat . to progress any further , another more intensive campaign of spectroscopic observation would be required .",
    "lastly , we have not yet been able to begin to find an explanation for the remarkable inverse p  cygni character of , most notably , the n@xmath11240 and si@xmath11397 line profiles detected in our third dataset .",
    "it is already clear that qu  car is a remarkable binary that has been overlooked for too long . in a separate study focusing on exploitation of the uv interstellar line data and new optical spectroscopy",
    "( drew et al .",
    "2002 ) , we show that this binary may in fact be closely related to the supersoft sources and then present evidence of carbon over - abundance .",
    "it is to be hoped that this re - evaluation of the status of qu  car and the presentation here , of its striking uv spectroscopic properties , will significantly broaden our perception of the ways the universe finds to configure such high - state compact binaries .",
