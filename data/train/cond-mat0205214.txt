    "networks of electrical or elastic elements are used as models to study phenomena observed in disordered systems .",
    "they include dielectric breakdown@xcite , metal - insulator transitions@xcite , brittle fracture in disordered solids@xcite , and strength of trabecular bone@xcite .",
    "in particular , such models have provided insights on the critical phenomena@xcite , scale - invariant disorder@xcite , and size - dependence of the system@xcite . in this paper , we will study variations in strength of a class of such systems .",
    "breakdown processes depend on the size of the longest defect@xcite and such extreme value problems are difficult to analyze@xcite . however , their statistical properties are expected to be amenable to analysis ; this is seen to be the case for the class of problems we study here .",
    "we first consider fused - conducting networks , where the breakdown currents of each element is assumed to be proportional to its conductance ; i.e. , breakdown of a conductor occurs when the potential difference across it reaches a fixed value . in the simplest case ,",
    "conductances along each axis of a hyper - cube are set equal . in section",
    "ii , we calculate how an external current introduced at a node and removed from an adjacent node is distributed on the network@xcite .",
    "the green s function derived for this case can be used to calculate the current distribution due to an external field on a network from which a finite number of conductances are removed ( section iii ) .",
    "this calculation is used to determine how the breaking current on a network of fused conductances is reduced due to a fracture of size @xmath0 .",
    "the remaining sections of the paper involve numerical analysis to show how this relationship is modified in a variety of other electrical and elastic networks .",
    "section iii also provides a discussion of the effects of random removal of elements from a two dimensional network .    in section iv ,",
    "we present analogous results for cubic networks with randomly chosen conductances .",
    "the relationship between the strength of a network and the fraction of bonds removed is shown to have a form similar to relationships found in section iii .",
    "section v shows that the strength of disordered elastic networks which include elastic and bond - bending energies also follow the same form .",
    "the motivation for this study is to develop a method to relate the mean strength of a bone to its mass@xcite .",
    "a solution of this problem can provide a non - invasive method to diagnose bone strength and can aid in the management of osteoporosis .",
    "these issues are addressed in the concluding section .",

    "as before , it is found that @xmath41 depends on the level @xmath42 of disorder .",
    "the elastic network model we consider is constructed by displacing the nodes of a hyper - cubic network randomly@xcite .",
    "the displacements ( of less than @xmath43 ) are chosen to be small enough that the topological structure of the network remains unchanged .",
    "adjacent nodes are joined by struts whose elastic moduli are chosen randomly from a pre - determined range ; i.e.,@xmath44\\,$ ] .",
    "bond - bending terms which depend on the variation of the angles between adjacent bonds on the network are included .",

    "these networks are degraded by removing a fraction @xmath39 of the links randomly , and the remaining elastic elements are assumed to retain their moduli .",
    "thus the total energy of the network is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the change of the length of an elastic element under a given external strain of the network , and @xmath48 is the variation of a bond - angle from equilibrium .",
    "a strain based criterion is used to implement fracture of elastic elements and bond angles of the network .",
    "any strut that is strained beyond a value @xmath49 is removed from the network along with all bond - angles it contributes to .",
    "@xmath50 for the elastic elements are chosen from a weibull distribution whose cumulative density is@xcite @xmath51\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a corresponding criterion is included for fracture of bonds .",
    "a given uniform external strain @xmath52 is imposed through a sequence of small adiabatic increments . if elastic elements or bond - angles are removed from the network due to a fracture , equilibrium is re - calculated prior to increasing @xmath53 .",
    "nodes on the sides of the network transverse to the external strain are constrained to move in plane .",
    "the force @xmath54 required to sustain a strain @xmath53 is calculated by adding the vertical forces on the top of the layer .",
    "the equilibrium of a network is calculated by minimizing its energy using the conjugated gradient method@xcite .    for small values of the compression @xmath53 ,",
    "the stress - vs - strain relationship @xmath54 is linear .",
    "numerical analysis shows that @xmath54 becomes nonlinear ( at the yield point ) following the first fracture of elastic elements@xcite . as @xmath53 is increased further , the stress reaches a maximum ( which , for a network a fraction @xmath39 of whose elements have been removed , is denoted @xmath55 ) prior to failure .",
    "the analog of eqn .",
    "( 18 ) for an elastic network is @xmath56 figures 8 and 9 show that this expression is satisfied for square and cubic disordered elastic networks . as in elastic networks , @xmath41 depends on the quantities @xmath57 and @xmath58 characterizing the level of disorder .",
    "it is further found to depend on the ratio @xmath59 of mean linear response coefficients of elastic and bond - bending terms .",
    "the reduction of @xmath55 due to the random removal of a fraction @xmath39 of elastic elements . in continuous line",
    "is shown the average obeying expression ( 22 ) of a square network of size @xmath60 the parameters for the best fit are @xmath61     the same as in figure 8 for a cubic elastic network of size @xmath62for the nonlinear fit @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "the motivation for the work reported here is the need to identify measures that can be used as non - invasive diagnostic tools to estimate the strength of bone .",
    "large bones consist of an outer compact shaft and an inner porous region ( trabecular architecture ) whose structure is reminiscent of a network of disordered cubic networks@xcite . due to loss of fracture toughness@xcite of the outer shaft ,",
    "the trabecular architecture becomes the principal load carrier in older adults .",
    "reduction in sex - steroid hormones ( estrogen and testosterone ) effect bone turnover , leading to degradation of the porous bone . beyond this stage , it is important to monitor the loss of bone strength at regular intervals , preferably with non - invasive diagnosis tools .",
    "the principal mechanism for loss of trabecular mass is through removal of individual struts , due to minor trauma .",
    "fracture toughness and thickness of the remaining trabecular bone do no change appreciably .",
    "mechanical studies on ex - vivo bone samples have shown that trabecular networks from patients with a broad range of ages fracture at a fixed level of strain@xcite , even though the corresponding fracture stresses exhibit large variations .",
    "these observations motivated the fracture criteria used in our models .",
    "( 18 ) is the main result of the paper .",
    "its form is justified by the calculations on a network of fused conductors presented in section iiia .",
    "the numerical analysis of random electrical networks and disordered elastic networks are used to confirm that the strength bears the same relationship to the level of elements removed from the network .",
    "the index @xmath41 corresponding to random removal of elements is larger that in the case of a single fracture ( = 1/4 ) , indicating that correlations between fractures is important to determine the strength of a network@xcite .",
    "it is important to test if samples of trabecular bone satisfy eqn . (",
    "previous studies on bone samples have suggested a nonlinear relationship between the breaking strength @xmath65 and the effective density @xmath66 of trabecular bone .",
    "it was found heuristically that @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "if it is assumed that the density of bone material remains intact and that the fractional reduction of effective density is proportional to @xmath39 , then the relationship eqn .",
    "( 18 ) can be tested using this data .",
