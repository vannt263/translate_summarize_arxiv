    "the compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by the hot gas present in clusters of galaxies , was first described by sunyaev & zeldovich ( 1970 ) .",
    "the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich effect -hereafter sz- has two components : thermal and kinematic . the first is caused by the random thermal motions of the electrons whose distribution is assumed to be isotropic ( in the cluster reference frame ) .",
    "the kinematic component is an additional effect due to the peculiar velocity of the cluster with respect to the cmb ( see rephaeli 1995 for a review ) .",
    "nowadays , several groups are searching or are setting up telescopes to measure the sz effect on single clusters ( holzapfel et al .",
    "1997 , jones 1996 , saunders 1996 ) .",
    "but besides the effect of individual clusters the entire cluster population acts as a screen of scattering sites through which the background photons must pass to reach the observer .",
    "the overall effect is both to distort the black body spectrum and to induce temperature anisotropies on the cmb .",
    "the latter is an important component of the full anisotropy on angular scales of several arcminutes ( cole & kaiser 1989 , bartlett & silk 1994 , colafrancesco et al .",
    "the anisotropy depends on the cluster richness , its evolution and on the cosmological model .",
    "therefore , detection of anisotropies and distortions will yield significant insight into the cosmological evolution of clusters .",
    "the analysis of the cobe / firas data yielded an upper limit on the degree of comptonization of the cmb ( determined by the parameter @xmath1 to be defined below ) of @xmath2 at 95% confidence level ( mather et al .",
    "the planck satellite , scheduled to be launched in the next decade , will not specifically look for distortions .",
    "those will be deduced from the data on temperature anisotropies . at the present stage",
    "several groups are studying methods to substract foregrounds ( tegmark & efstathiou 1996 , hobson et al .",
    "1998 ) and are performing simulations to predict the sensitivity level at which cosmological parameters can be measured . in this respect",
    ", it is necessary to carry out a careful analysis of the power spectrum of the foregrounds since this will allow to distinguish at each frequency between the genuine cmb distortions and the contribution of clusters and other foregrounds .",
    "as remarked by tegmark & efstathiou ( 1996 ) this improves the technique of removing foregrounds simply by comparing data at different frequencies .    in this paper",
    "we shall obtain the radiation power spectrum of cmb temperature anisotropies induced by the entire population of clusters of galaxies , the mean distortion and the ratio of the temperature anisotropy measured by suzie ( church et al .",
    "1997 ) to the comptonization parameter .",
    "we will show that distortions and temperature anisotropies are related not only for a single cluster but also for the values averaged over all clusters .",
    "we extend the work of bartlett & silk ( 1994 ) and colafrancesco et al .",
    "( 1997 ) by computing the power spectrum and analyzing its dependence with the parameters describing the cluster population and the number density .",
    "contrary to the latter authors , we do not make a detailed analysis of all cosmological models .",
    "we shall restrict our study to the standard cold dark matter model .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we rederive the power spectrum of the temperature anisotropies due to the contribution of clusters of galaxies . in sec . 3",
    ", we integrate our equations assuming a number density of clusters given by the press - schechter formalism .",
    "we give the shape of the power spectrum and its dependence on properties of the average sz cluster population . in sec .",
    "4 , we show that while the amplitude of the radiation power spectrum and the cmb distortion varies strongly with the main cluster parameters , the ratio of the temperature fluctuation to the mean comptonization parameter is almost independent of the parameters of the cluster model . in first approximation , this ratio is determined solely by the number density of clusters . finally , in sec . 5",
    ", we present our main conclusions .",
    "the passage of cmb photons through a single cluster of galaxies distorts the radiation spectrum due to the inverse compton scattering .",
    "the amplitude of the distortion depends on frequency .",
    "it can be described more appropriately in terms of the change in brightness on the cmb .",
    "the temperature difference is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the cmb frequency in dimensionless units and @xmath5 gives the frequency dependence of the effect .",
    "the cluster comptonization parameter is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the intracluster electron density and temperature , @xmath9 is the thomson cross section , @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath11 is the electron mass and the integral is performed along the line of sight through the cluster .",
    "clusters are known to be extended x  ray sources with gas density profiles well fitted by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the central electron density and @xmath14 is the core radius of the cluster .",
    "the observed values of @xmath15 , obtained from x - ray surface brightness profiles , range from 0.5 to 0.7 ( jones & forman 1984 , markevitch et al .",
    "1997 ) . throughout this paper",
    "we will adopt @xmath16 since it permits a more simplified treatment .",
    "the distortion induced by the ic gas depends on the temperature profile along the line of sight through the cluster .",
    "while most authors assumed the ic gas to be isothermal , in a recent study encompassing 26 nearby asca clusters markevitch et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have shown that the gas temperature within clusters decreases slowly with radius .",
    "note that the uncertainty about the asca point spread function implies that errors on the density profile of individual clusters are correlated .",
    "therefore , their data can not be used to estimate the average properties of the ic gas . to simplify",
    ", we shall retain the hypothesis of isothermality since the computation becomes simpler , but keeping in mind that our analysis could be easily modified to take into account any dependence of temperature with radius .    if the virial radius of the cluster @xmath17 is expressed in terms of the core radius as @xmath18 , eq .",

    "note that @xmath24 , given as the ratio between the virial and the core radius , is not a parameter but a function of mass @xmath25 and redshift @xmath26 .",
    "the mean distortion on the cmb induced by all clusters is obtained adding the effect of one cluster for all possible lines of sight : @xmath27 in this expression , @xmath28 is the cluster number density per unit of mass , @xmath29 gives the probability that a particular line of sight crosses a cluster .",
    "this probability is simply @xmath30 .",
    "finally , @xmath31 is the averaged line of sight through a cluster : @xmath32 it is useful to introduce the following notation : @xmath33 this allows to write @xmath34 .",
    "now eq.[[ycmean ] ] can be rewritten as follows : @xmath35 notice that @xmath1 can now be understood as the average of @xmath36 over the entire cluster population .",
    "the superposed effect is determined by the cosmological model , cluster abundance and redshift evolution of the ic medium ( colafrancesco et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the ic gas does not only produce distortions on the cmb spectrum .",
    "it also induces temperature anisotropies .",
    "the contribution of a single cluster to the temperature anisotropy on a wavenumber @xmath37 is @xmath38    the power spectrum can be obtained by adding in quadrature the contribution of all clusters .",
    "neglecting cluster spatial correlations , we can write ( cole & kaiser 1988 ; cp . also bartlett & silk 1994 ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fourier transform of the angular profile of the cluster . for scales",
    "much larger than the virial radius of a typical cluster , radiation temperature anisotropies originated by the contribution of poisson distributed clusters lead to @xmath41 .    for scales @xmath42 the behaviour of @xmath43",
    "can be obtained analytically taking the limit @xmath24 going to infinity ( but keeping @xmath44 finite ) . in this limit ,",
    "the radiation power spectrum becomes exponentially damped , that is , it decreases faster than @xmath45 as expected by tegmark & efstathiou ( 1996 ) . in agreement with these authors , we shall demostrate numerically that @xmath46 has a coherence scale , i.e. a maximun , around @xmath47 . for reference ,",
    "let us mention that the angular scale @xmath48 corresponds to a wavenumber @xmath49mpc@xmath50 or scalelength @xmath51mpc .",
    "from the power spectrum we can compute the correlation function of temperature anisotropies . in the flat sky approximation",
    ", it is given by ( atrio - barandela , gottlber & mcket 1997 ) @xmath52 where w(l ) represents the window function of the experiment .",
    "this expression can be rewritten in a more illuminating form .",
    "replacing the power spectrum ( eq .",
    "[ [ pq ] ] ) , and after some algebra , for an experiment with infinite resolution and full sky coverage , we obtain : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is given by eq .  [",

    "1997 ) and with the upper limits obtained from their observations we shall set a constraint on @xmath1 stronger than the one derived from cobe / firas .",
    "numerical estimates of the mean comptonization parameter , the power spectrum and the correlation function for a given experiment require the cluster number density and average properties , as a function of mass , redshift evolution of the ic gas and cosmological model , to be specified .",

    "was found by colafrancesco & vittorio ( 1994 ) by fitting the standard cdm model to the observed cluster x - ray luminosity function .",
    "the results presented in the next section were obtained assuming the former value at all redshifts .    to compute the temperature anisotropies induced by hot ic gas , we need to translate the properties of a sample of clusters at low redshifts into their equivalents at earlier epochs . in what follows",

    "for the spherical collapse model , the virial radius scales as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the current average virial radius of a @xmath73m@xmath69 cluster .",
    "we shall use the entropy - driven model of cluster evolution developed by bower ( 1997 ) to describe the core radius evolution as a function of redshift and mass .",

    "finally , we took the present gas density of a @xmath73m@xmath69 cluster to be @xmath91@xmath92 ( peebles , 1993 ) for a hubble constant of @xmath64 .",
    "we would like to remark that all the relations introduced in this section are to be thought accurate in determining the mean evolution of the cluster population as a whole .",

    "the main limitation of our work is to determine the scale of the less massive objects containing enough hot gas to produce a measurable effect on the cmb .",
    "we shall ellaborate on this point further below . except",

    "the cmb blackbody temperature @xmath96 is expressed in units of @xmath97k .",
    "we took @xmath98 in all our plots , so the y - axis should be multiplied by the correct value when comparing with a particular experiment .",
    "one should notice that the mean temperature offset scales as : @xmath99 where the values of all these constants , given in the previous section , correspond to a @xmath73m@xmath69 cluster .",
    "in this way , the y - axis on fig .",

    "( [ fig1]a ) we consider the effect of different ic gas evolution histories : @xmath102 ( thin solid line ) , @xmath103 ( thick solid line ) and @xmath104 ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "in all plots we considered the ratio of virial to core radius to be @xmath105 today . in fig .",
    "( [ fig1]b ) we show the effect of varying the core radius for a fixed virial radius today , and no ic gas evolution ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "we considered @xmath106 .",
    "notice that the amplitude is largest for @xmath107 and @xmath108 since those models lead to larger gas fractions . as expected from our discussion in sec .",
    "2 , all power spectra have a similar bell shape in all cases .",
    "the coherence scales are around @xmath109 .",
    "differences in shape are less important than in amplitude .",
    "also , notice that the dependence is stronger on the core radius than on the ic gas evolution .",
    "if our cluster model is correct , measuring the anisotropy induced by clusters of galaxies an estimate of the average core radius of the cluster population could be obtained which will only depend marginally on the ic gas evolution .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig2]a ) we show the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies for different mass cut - off : @xmath110m@xmath69 .",
    "notice that the amplitude of the power spectrum is remarkably unsensitive to the change in the lower limit , the reason being that the integrand of eq .",

    "the left solid line displays @xmath112 , the dashed line represents @xmath113 for @xmath114 while @xmath115 is represented by the right solid line . as a result , the bulk of the contribution to the radiation power spectrum comes from clusters of mass close to @xmath68m@xmath69 .",
    "so , even though the entropy driven model of clusters we used has not been checked for cluster masses below @xmath68m@xmath69 , the cmb temperature fluctuations shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) are reasonable accurate .",
    "this is not the case for the mean comptonization parameter @xmath1 which depends strongly on the lower mass cut - off as the contribution of clusters of small mass dominate the integral , as indicated by fig .",
    "( [ fig2]b ) .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig3]a ) we plot the mean comptonization parameter as a function of the ic gas evolution .",
    "we varied the lower mass limit of the integral in eq .",
    "[ [ ycmean ] ] . from top to bottom , the thin solid line corresponds to a lower mass limit of @xmath116m@xmath69 , the dash - dotted line to @xmath117m@xmath69 , and the thick solid line to @xmath68m@xmath69 , all three with @xmath105 .",
    "the upper and lower dashed lines correspond to @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "in the latter two cases the lower mass limit was @xmath68m@xmath69 .    in analogy to the relation eq .",
    "[ [ dtt ] ] we introduce a new variable @xmath119 defined as @xmath120 in fig .",
    "( [ fig3]b ) we plot the behaviour of @xmath119 for the most extreme parameters of the cluster model used . to calculate the correlation function we used suzie window function .",
    "again , we assumed @xmath98 .",
    "lines correspond to the same models as in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] a ) .",
    "the curves corresponding to different lower limits on the mass integral are represented twice .",
    "we have ploted @xmath119 ( lower thin solid and dot dashed lines ) and @xmath121 ( upper thin and dashed - dotted lines ) .",
    "this figure demonstrates that while @xmath122 and @xmath1 depend strongly on the evolution of the ic gas and the size of the core radius , @xmath119 varies by less than 20% .",
    "the largest dependence of @xmath119 comes from varying the present number density of clusters . in the press - schechter theory , decreasing the lower mass limit increases @xmath123 , the number density of clusters above a given mass scale . in our case",
    ", the lower mass limits @xmath124m@xmath69 correspond to @xmath125 and @xmath126 clusters per @xmath127mpc@xmath128 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath122 and @xmath1 instead of being normalized to @xmath129 were normalized to a fixed number of clusters today , temperature correlation and mean distortion would be rescaled as : @xmath130 and @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the number density of clusters that produce a measurable effect on the cmb .",
    "then @xmath119 will scale as @xmath133 .",
    "going back to fig .",
    "( [ fig3]b ) the reader can check that this rescaling renders the solid thin and the dot - dashed lines in the range of @xmath134 .",
    "let us remark that the value of @xmath119 is different for different experiments .",
    "for suzie @xmath135 and for an experiment with infinite angular resolution @xmath136 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ correlation_analytic ] ] ) .",
    "however , a tight relation between distortion and anisotropy exists , independently of the experiment considered .",
    "this tight relation is the consequence of the unsensitivity of the power spectrum with the lower limit of the mass integral .    the upper limits on cmb temperature anisotropies obtained by suzie ( church et al .",
    "1997 ) on angular scales of @xmath137 can be used to estimate upper limits on the mean comptonization parameter that are stronger than those set by cobe / firas .",
    "let us assume that that temperature anisotropies on scales measured by suzie are dominated by clusters , a very conservative assumption for the argument that follows . using the results summarized in fig .",
    "( [ fig3]b ) , we can impose an upper limit on @xmath1 from suzie upper limit ( in absolute value ) @xmath138 at the 95% confidence level . at 142 ghz , suzie operating frequency ,",
    "@xmath139 . if we assume that only clusters with masses larger than @xmath68m@xmath69 contribute to the cmb distortion , we have @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , @xmath141 , a contraint stronger than the upper limit obtained by mather et al .",
    "( 1994 ) at the same confidence level .",
    "let us remark that the suzie upper limits quoted above were obtained assuming gaussian statistics , while in our analysis we assumed that clusters were poisson distributed on the sky .",
    "a firm upper bound can not be obtained wihtout reanalyzing the suzie data",
    ".    the mean density of clusters can be estimated with independent measurements of distortion and temperature anisotropy .",
    "if the contribution of clusters to the temperature fluctuations of the cmb is measured by , say , suzie and the blackbody distortion is also determined , comparison with fig ( 3b ) would allow a direct estimate of the number density of clusters with ic gas hot enough to produce a significant contribution to the sz effect .",
    "comparison of the mean number density of sz clusters with that of x - ray clusters would lead to a better understanding of the ic gas evolution history .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the shape of the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies induced by the hot ic gas is almost independent of model parameters .",
    "however , the amplitude does depend on how the mean population of clusters is modeled . as shown by tegmark ( 1998 )",
    "the shape of the power spectrum is important for extracting the foreground contribution on experiments measuring the same region of the sky at different frequencies and angular scales .",
    "one could expect the amplitude to be obtained from measurements of temperature anisotropies on experiments like suzie ( holzapfel et al .",
    "1997 ) , ryle ( saunders 1997 ) , vsa ( jones 1996 ) or the upcomming map and planck satellite missions .",
    "this will set strong constraints on the average properties of the cluster population .",
    "we showed that a relation between the temperature anisotropy and the mean comptonization parameter exists on the average , independent of the cluster model and ic gas evolution .",
    "the influence @xmath142 shown in figure 1b and 3a cancels out in the ratio @xmath119 . in a first approximation",
    ", this ratio only varies with the number density of clusters contributing to sz effect .",
    "this conclusion relies on the assumption that the cluster population as a whole is well described by the scaling relations of eq .",
    "( [ [ temp]]-[[rc ] ] ) .",
    "this hypothesis , known as weak self - similarity principle ( bower 1997 ) do not imply these relations should be accurate for single cluster .",
    "for example , asphericity is important when computing the effect of a single cluster on the cmb , but it should average out when considering the effect of the whole cluster population .",
    "but , if electron clumpiness or temperature gradients are shown to be common in clusters , this would limit the validity of our results .",
    "we do not know how to quantify these effects at the present and for this reason we did not include them into our analysis .",
    "also , let us remark that the influence of different cosmological models through @xmath143 has not been addressed in this paper .    to conclude ,",
    "if our cluster model is applicable to the average cluster population and the number density of sz clusters is known , then data on temperature anisotropies can be used to determine the distortion of the cmb . on the other hand two independent measurements of temperature anisotropy and distortion would provide an estimate of the number density of sunyaev ",

    "<S> it remains constant while at multipoles above @xmath0 it is exponentially damped . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the radiation power spectrum is almost independent of the average intracluster gas density profile , gas evolution history or clusters core radii ; but the amplitude depends strongly on those parameters . </S>",
    "<S> its exact value depends on the global properties of the cluster population and the evolution of the intracluster gas . the distortion on the cosmic microwave background blackbody spectra varies in a similar manner . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the temperature anisotropy to the mean comptonization parameters is shown to be almost independent of the parameters of the cluster model and , in first approximation , depends only on the number density of clusters . </S>",
    "<S> an independent determination of the contribution of clusters to the distortion of the blackbody spectrum and the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background would determine the number density of clusters that contribute to the sunyaev  </S>",
