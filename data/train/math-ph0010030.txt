    "quantum dots ( qds ) are essentially quasi - zero - dimensional little islands , populated by two - dimensional ( _ flatland _ ) electrons laterally confined by an artificial potential [ 1,2 ] . the variation of their spectra with magnetic field is often called magnetic fingerprints of qds .",
    "recent intensive experimental and theoretical investigations have been carried out to explore various spectral properties of qds . yet",
    "such studies are in their infancy and still expanding rapidly [ 1 - 15 ] .",
    "the ion - electron and electron - electron interactions in such qds are of great importance [ 6,8 - 11 ] .",
    "the hamiltonians ( section 2 - 1 ) of which are known to belong to non - exactly soluble hamiltonians .",
    "one has therefore to resort to approximation methods to study such systems .",
    "there has been , in the last few years , an increasing interest in the study of two - electron qds in a magnetic field [ 6,12 - 15 ] . among the several eligible and reliable methods for solving the multi - electron problem in qds exist : exact numerical diagonalization [ 2,16 ] , numerical simulations based on quantum monte carlo techniques [ 17 ] , hartree - fock calculations [ 16 , 18 - 20 ] , a series solution based on asymptotically physical grounds of the wave functions in the regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 [ 6,21 ] , etc .",
    "it is therefore interesting to carry out systematic studies of the electronic structures in qds populated by one and two electrons with and without magnetic fields .",
    "recently , we have introduced a pseudoperturbative ( artificial in nature ) shifted - @xmath2 ( @xmath2 is the angular momentum quantum number ) expansion technique ( pslet ) to solve schrdinger equation for states with arbitrary number of nodal zeros .",
    "it simply consists of using @xmath3 as a pseudoperturbation parameter , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a suitable shift to be determined [ 22 - 27 ] .",
    "encouraged by its very satisfactory performance ( documented in [ 22 - 27 ] through comparisons with direct numerical integration , quasi perturbative , variational , hill determinant , etc , methods ) , we use pslet recipe , in section 2 - 2 , and study the spectral properties of an electron in a parabolic qd with a negatively charged ion ( impurity ) , and two electrons in such a qd with and without the magnetic field .    in section 3",
    "we compare our results with the ones obtained by zhu et al.[6 ] , via a series solution , and report on other states that have not been considered before , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the effect of ion - electron ( section 3 - 1 ) and electron - electron ( section 3 - 2 ) interactions are also discussed . in the absence of these interactions",
    "we show that whilst the magnetic field _",
    "completely _ lifts the confinement degeneracy , as it increases from zero , for the one electron case , it _ partially _ lifts it for the two - electron case .",
    "moreover , at infinite magnetic fields the energy levels cluster around landau ones , inducing in effect landau degeneracy .",
    "the inclusion of these interactions , on the other hand , _ completely _ lifts the confinement and landau degeneracies and change levels ordering .",
    "consequently , energy levels crossing occur and spin - singlet spin - triplet oscillations are manifested for two - electron qds in a magnetic field .",
    "section 4 is devoted for concluding remarks .",
    "to a very good approximation , the harmonic oscillator describes the lateral confinement of electrons in some experimentally created qds .",
    "the motion in the z - direction ( the growth direction ) is always frozen out into the lowest subband [ 6,28 ] .",
    "the confinement in this direction is assumed to be stronger than that in the xy - plane , and the dots , in effect , can be treated as two - dimensional thin discs [ 6,21 ] .",
    "then the hamiltonian of an electron in such a parabolic qd with a negatively charged ion center is very well simulated by + @xmath6 + and that of two electrons in the same qd by + @xmath7 + ( in effective atomic units ) with @xmath8 related to the confinement region ( hence to the quantum size ) of the electrons in the qds .",
    "the energy and length are given in effective rydberg @xmath9 and effective bohr radius @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "when a magnetic field @xmath11 is applied perpendicular to the xy - plane , through the symmetric gauge @xmath12 , the hamiltonians in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , respectively , read + @xmath13 + and + @xmath14 + where @xmath15 with the cyclotron frequency @xmath16 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the induced zeeman terms .",
    "obviously , hamiltonian ( 4 ) is separable and can be recast as + @xmath19 + where + @xmath20 + and + @xmath21 + which represent the center - of - mass ( cm ) and the relative - motion ( rm ) hamiltonians , respectively . here , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the z- and z- components of the angular momentum operators in the cm and rm systems , respectively .",
    "effectively , the problem is reduced into two : a quasi - particle of the cm coordinate in a rescaled external field , and a quasi - particle of the rm coordinate in a rescaled external field and a rescaled repulsive coulomb field ( emerging from the electron - electron interaction ) .",
    "the cylindrical symmetry of the attendant problems invites the separability of the wave functions to obtain .",
    "hence , the two - particle wave function in the plane polar coordinate systems is @xmath29 .",
    "the pauli principle demands that @xmath30 is antisymmetric with respect to inversion @xmath31 .",
    "no restrictions on @xmath32 are imposed .",
    "one would therefore obtain spin - singlet ( @xmath33 ) and spin - triplet ( @xmath34 ) states for even and odd @xmath35 , respectively , through the prescription @xmath36 .",
    "eventually , schrdinger equation for hamiltonian ( 7 ) reads + @xmath37 u_{k , m}(r ) = \\left[\\frac{e(k , m)-m\\gamma}{2}\\right ] u_{k , m}(r),\\ ] ] + where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 and @xmath35 are the radial and azimuthal quantum numbers in the rm system , respectively .",
    "it is convenient to define the electron - electron interaction energies as + @xmath40 + where + @xmath41 + are the energies of ( 8) without the coulomb interaction",
    ". then the total energies of ( 4 ) are + @xmath42 + where + @xmath43 + are the energies of ( 6 ) , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 the radial and azimuthal quantum numbers in the cm system , respectively .",
    "similarly , the ion - electron interaction energies are defined as + @xmath46 + where + @xmath47 + are the energies of ( 3 ) without the ion - electron interaction and @xmath48 are the eigenenergies of @xmath49 in ( 3 ) .      in the underlying radical radial time - independent schrdinger equation , in @xmath50 units , + @xmath51 \\psi_{k , l}(q)=e_{k , l}\\psi_{k , l}(q),\\ ] ] +",
    "the isomorphism between orbital angular momentum @xmath2 and dimensionality @xmath52 invites interdimensional degeneracies to obtain . which , in effect , adds a delicate nature to this equation and allows us to generate the ladder of excited states for",
    "any given @xmath39 ( number of the nodal zeros in the wave function ) and nonzero @xmath2 from the @xmath53 result , with that @xmath39 , by the transcription @xmath54 .",
    "for more details the reader may refer to ref.s [ 26,29 - 31 ] .",
    "our recipe starts with shifting the angular momentum quantum number @xmath2 in ( 15 ) through @xmath55 and use @xmath3 as a pseudoperturbation expansion parameter .",
    "hence , equation ( 15 ) reads + @xmath56 + where q is a constant that scales the potential @xmath57 at large - @xmath58 limit and is set , for any specific choice of @xmath58 and @xmath39 , equal to @xmath59 at the end of the calculations . here",
    "@xmath60 , to incorporate the interdimensional degeneracies .",
    "hence , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( with @xmath63 ) through out this paper .",
    "next , we shift the origin of the coordinate system through @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is currently an arbitrary point to be determined below",
    ". expansions about this point , @xmath66 ( i.e. @xmath67 ) would lead to + @xmath68 \\psi_{k , l}(x)=\\frac{q_{o}^2}{\\bar{l}}e_{k , l}\\psi_{k , l}(x),\\ ] ] + with + @xmath69 + \\bar{l}^{1/2}b_1 x+\\sum^{\\infty}_{n=0 } v^{(n)}(x ) \\bar{l}^{-n/2},\\ ] ] + where + @xmath70 + @xmath71 + @xmath72 + @xmath73 + it is then convenient to expand @xmath74 as + @xmath75 + equation ( 17 ) , along with ( 18)-(22 ) , is evidently the one - dimensional schrdinger equation for a harmonic oscillator @xmath76 , with @xmath77 , and the remaining terms in eq.(17 ) as infinite power series perturbations to the harmonic oscillator .",
    "one would then imply that + @xmath78 + @xmath79\\ ] ] + where @xmath65 is chosen to minimize @xmath80 , i. e. + @xmath81 + equation ( 26 ) in turn gives , with @xmath82 , + @xmath83 + the shifting parameter @xmath5 is determined by choosing @xmath84=0 .",
    "hence + @xmath85,~~ \\omega=\\sqrt{3+\\frac{q_o v^{''}(q_o)}{v^{'}(q_o)}}\\ ] ] + where primes of @xmath86 denote derivatives with respect to @xmath65",
    ". then equation ( 17 ) reduces to + @xmath87\\psi_{k , l } ( x)=   \\left[\\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1 } q_o^2 e_{k , l}^{(n-1 ) } \\bar{l}^{-n } \\right ] \\psi_{k , l}(x).\\ ] ] + setting the wave functions with any number of nodes @xmath39 as + @xmath88 + equation ( 29 ) readily transforms into the following riccati equation : + @xmath89 -f_{k , l}^{'}(x)u_{k , l}^{'}(x)-\\frac{1}{2}f_{k , l}^{''}(x)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + where the primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath90 .",
    "it is evident that this equation admits solution of the form + @xmath91 + @xmath92 + where + @xmath93 + @xmath94 + substituting equations ( 32 ) - ( 35 ) into equation ( 29 ) implies + @xmath95 \\nonumber\\\\ & -&f_{k , l}^{'}(x)\\left[\\sum^{\\infty}_{n=0}\\left(u_{k}^{(n)}\\bar{l}^{-n/2 } + g_{k}^{(n ) } \\bar{l}^{-(n+1)/2}\\right)\\right]-\\frac{1}{2}f_{k , l}^{''}(x ) = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + the solution of equation ( 36 ) follows from the uniqueness of power series representation .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath39 we equate the coefficients of the same powers of @xmath96 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "one can then calculate the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions from the knowledge of @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 in a hierarchical manner .",
    "nevertheless , the procedure just described is suitable for a software package such as maple to determine the energy eigenvalue and eigenfunction corrections up to any order of the pseudoperturbation series ( 23 ) .",
    "although the energy series , equation ( 23 ) , could appear divergent , or , at best , asymptotic for small @xmath96 , one can still calculate the eigenenergies to a very good accuracy by forming the sophisticated pad approximation [ 22 - 24,26,32 ] + @xmath100 + to the energy series ( 23 ) .",
    "the energy series is calculated up to @xmath101 by @xmath102 + and with the @xmath103 pad approximant it becomes + @xmath104=\\bar{l}^{2}e_{k , l}^{(-2)}+p_{10}^{9}(1/\\bar{l}).\\ ] ] + our recipe is therefore well prescribed .",
    "it is obvious , to a scaling factor , that hamiltonians ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) bear the same form of a hybrid of a repulsive coulomb and oscillator potentials + @xmath105 + hence , equation ( 28 ) yields + @xmath106 + and , in turn , equation ( 27 ) reads + @xmath107 + once @xmath65 is determined ( often numerically ) the coefficients @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 are obtained in a sequential manner .",
    "then the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are calculated in one batch for each value of @xmath39 , @xmath52 , @xmath2 , and @xmath108 .    in order to make remediable analysis of our results we have calculated the first twenty terms of our energy series . we have also computed the corresponding sequence of pad approximants @xmath109 , @xmath110,@xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and observed their effects on the leading energy term @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , the _ twofold _ effect of the first term in the effective potential + @xmath115 + should be in point .",
    "that is , for @xmath116 it represents an attractive core that strengthens the comfinement , whereas for @xmath117 it represents a repulsive core and strengthens the coulomb repulsion .",
    "in table 1 we display the energies of an electron in parabolic qds , _ including _ ion - electron interaction , in a magnetic field for @xmath118 .",
    "they compare excellently with those reported by zhu et al . in figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) of [ 6 ] .",
    "in addition we report pslet results for 4d@xmath119 , 4p@xmath119 , 5d@xmath119 , and 6f@xmath119 states .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the energies of an electron in such qds ( with @xmath118 ) versus @xmath120 , _ excluding _ ion - electron interaction .",
    "clearly , it shows that whilst the magnetic field _",
    "completely _ lifts the well known confinement degeneracy , @xmath121 , as @xmath120 increases from zero , it eventually introduces landau degeneracy as @xmath122 . and , at @xmath123 only s - states are feasible and degenerate .",
    "that is , a state @xmath124 would cluster at an s - state @xmath125 through the prescription + @xmath126    in the range of small @xmath120 ( namely , @xmath127 ) , one clearly observes that there are minima for states with negative @xmath35 , whereas for states with positive @xmath35 and s - states ( @xmath128 ) increase monotonically .",
    "this should be attributed to the following : ( i ) for @xmath128 , the effective potential does not support a minimum and the zeeman term has no effect on these states , hence s - states increase monotonically .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath117 , the effective potential supports minima and the zeeman term @xmath129 refines them for negative value of @xmath35 or shifts them up for positive @xmath35 .",
    "however , in the range of large @xmath120 the magnetic field ( in @xmath130 ) dominates over the zeeman term and the leading term in the effective potential , hence all energy levels increase monotonically in this range of @xmath120 . as a result of ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "one observes the energy levels crossings between different states in the range of small @xmath120 in figure 1 .    the inclusion of the ion - electron interaction ( figures 2 - 4 ) significantly changes the spectral properties mentioned above . at @xmath131 ( see figures 2 - 4 ) , one notices that all energies are shifted up .",
    "for example , the 1s - states is shifted ( in @xmath132 units ) by 0.6162 , 2p@xmath133 and 2p@xmath134 by 0.4666 , 3d@xmath133 and 3d@xmath134 by 0.3829 , 4f@xmath133 and 4f@xmath134 by 0.3305 , etc .",
    "this shift decreases as @xmath135 increases . for higher levels ( larger @xmath135 ) @xmath136 increases and",
    "the coulomb repulsion @xmath137 decreases , a characteristic which is reflected upon the energy shift - ups in figures 2 - 4 .",
    "as @xmath120 increases from zero , figures 2 - 4 clearly show that the ion - electron interaction _ completely _ lifts landau degeneracy and results in change in levels ordering .",
    "consequently , energy crossings occur and odd - even parity oscillations are manifested ( 2p@xmath134 crosses with 4d@xmath133 , 4d@xmath133 crosses with 4f@xmath134 , 3d@xmath134 in figure 3 ) .",
    "figure 1(b ) of zhu et al.[6 ] also bear this out .    to explain energy crossings , we consider the energy shift - ups as a result of the ion - electron interaction . at @xmath138 (",
    "energy crossings occur in the range @xmath127 ) for example , the 1s - state is shifted ( in ry@xmath139 units ) by @xmath140 , 2p@xmath133 and 2p@xmath134 by @xmath141 , 3d@xmath133 and 3d@xmath134 by @xmath142 , 4f@xmath133 and 4f@xmath134 by @xmath143 , and so on .",
    "obviously the ion - electron interaction does not distinguish between positive and negative @xmath35 values .",
    "moreover , the shift - ups decrease as @xmath135 increase for a given @xmath39 , or for a given @xmath135 as @xmath39 increases ( because of the coulomb repulsion characteristic mentioned above).this in fact explains why the energy ladder of the lower batch , say , of energy levels in figure 1 is turned up - side - down in figure 2 .",
    "similar scenarios could be also developed for figures 3 and 4 .",
    "next , we calculate the e@xmath119 - e@xmath119 interaction energies @xmath144 for two electrons in qds and compare them , in tables 2 and 3 , with those reported by zhu et al.[6 ] .",
    "they are in almost exact accord .",
    "we also display pslet results for 4s , 4p , 5d , 4f , and 5 g states .",
    "figure 5 shows that @xmath144 increases with @xmath120 and the levels ordering is @xmath145 , etc .",
    "before we proceed any further let us study the quantum size effect on the two - electron spectra .",
    "table 4 shows the quantum levels of two electrons in qds with different values of @xmath146 , hence showing the quantum size effect , when @xmath131 .",
    "it documents changes in the levels ordering ( consequently , energy crossings and singlet - triplet spin oscillations occur ) as @xmath146 decreases ( increases ) from 1(1 ) .",
    "hereby , it should be noted that zhu s [ 6 ] result @xmath147 for @xmath118 is now corrected from 1,4402 to 1.4413 in accordance with his finding in table 1 of [ 6 ] .",
    "the levels orderings for @xmath148 are changed from ( h ) ( e ) to ( e ) ( h ) and from ( k ) ( n ) to ( n ) ( k ) in accordance with our findings , based on the stability of , at least , the last five terms of the pad sequence ( a signal of convergence to the exact results ) mentioned above .    to study the e@xmath133-e@xmath133 interaction effect on the spectra , we plot the energy levels @xmath149 of two - electron qds with @xmath118 and at different values of @xmath120 are plotted in figure 6 ( _ excluding _ the e@xmath119 - e@xmath119 interaction ) and figure 7 ( _ including _ e@xmath119 - e@xmath119 interaction ) .",
    "figure 6 clearly shows that the magnetic field _ partially _ lifts the well known confinement degeneracy as @xmath120 increases from zero and induces landau degeneracy as @xmath122 .",
    "again , one observes the clustering of the quantum levels around @xmath150 states as @xmath122 , following a similar trend as that of ( 44 ) .",
    "the inclusion of the e@xmath119 - e@xmath119 interaction _ completely _ lifts the confinement and landau degeneracies and changes the levels ordering .",
    "consequently , energy crossings occur , at which singlet - triplet spin oscillations obtain , at specific magnetic fields .",
    "figures 6 and 7 bear these out .",
    "one could follow a similar scenario as that in section 3 - 1 to explain the energy crossings , since the e@xmath133-e@xmath133 interaction is effectively a repulsive coulomb term .    in table 5",
    "we display our results for two interacting electrons in qds in a magnetic field at different values of @xmath120 , and for @xmath118 . when plotted with the same scale",
    ", our results excellently agree with those of zhu , figure 2(b ) in [ 6 ] .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that the quantum levels classified in figure 2(b ) of zhu [ 6 ] as a , b , c , @xmath111 do not bear positive values of m and m but rather negative ones , classified in table 5 of this text .",
    "in this paper we have used our recently developed pslet theory [ 22 - 27 ] to study the magnetic fingerprints on the spectra of an electron in parabolic qds with negatively charged ion , and on two interacting electrons in such qds .",
    "we have also emphasized the effect of the symmetry of the problem ( marked in the leading term of the effective potential in ( 43 ) ) on the confinement and coulomb repulsive terms .",
    "the comparison of pslet results with those of zhu et al.[6 ] is readily very satisfactory .",
    "although we have started with the central force schrdinger equation and augmented the orbital angular momentum by @xmath151 , to incorporate interdimensional degeneracies , we have only considered the @xmath62 with @xmath63 case for the attendant problems .    a general observation concerning the method used by zhu et al.[6 ] is in order .",
    "we have already mentioned that the series solution method used by zhu et al.[6 ] is based upon the asymptotically physical grounds of the wave functions in the regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively ) .",
    "effectively and obviously , the authors used the asymptotic behaviours of the wave functions at weak and strong magnetic field limits implicitly . in the weak field limit the wave function is dominated by a coulombic character ( hence coulombic like basis are used in equation ( 12 ) of [ 6 ] ) and in the strong field limit its dominated by a harmonic oscillator character ( hence harmonic oscillator like basis are used in equation ( 14 ) of [ 6 ] ) . in fact , this is the only explanation , we could think of , as to why our results do not exactly agree with those of zhu in table 2 , for @xmath154 .",
    "the conceptual soundness of our pslet is obvious .",
    "it avoids troublesome questions pertaining to the nature of small parameter expansions ( weak or strong field limits ) , and trend of convergence to the exact results . on the computational and practical methodical sides , it offers ( beyond its promise as being quite handy ) a useful pseudoperturbation prescription where the zeroth order approximation @xmath155 inherits a substantial amount ( more than 90% for the above problems ) of the total energy .",
    "finally , pslet theory could be applied to two electrons in an external oscillator potential in @xmath156 space [ 33 ] , qd lattices [ 34 ] , 3 - electron qds [ 35 ] , 2 - dimensional hydrogenic donor states in a magnetic field [ 36 - 39 ] , etc .",
