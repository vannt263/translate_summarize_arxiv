    "despite significant observational and theoretical efforts over nearly 40 years of study , the nature of galactic  high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) is still a mystery . with the launch of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) , a new and important portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is now available to study hvcs . the far - ultraviolet provides a wealth of atomic , ionic , and molecular spectral lines that can be used to probe the physical conditions in hvcs @xcite . with its high resolution and large effective area ,",
    "_ fuse _ has the ability to probe hvcs along multiple lines of sight toward extragalactic objects .",
    "this paper presents an analysis of such a sightline and demonstrates the ability of fuse to significantly contribute to our understanding of hvcs .",
    "the sight line to mrk 876 ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) passes through hvc complex  c @xcite . @xcite",
    "suggest the distance to complex  c is in the range of 5 - 25 kpc , with @xmath5 kpc as the most likely value .",
    "they derive a mass for complex  c of @xmath6 which , combined with the observed radial velocity , implies a mass influx of @xmath7 .",
    "the metallicity of complex  c is in the range 0.1 to 0.6 solar @xcite and may be spatially variable toward multiple sightlines separated by more than 10 .",
    "the metallicity of hvcs can be used to discriminate between the current theories for their origins @xcite .    along the mrk 876 sightline , a 21 cm spectrum taken with the effelsberg 100 m telescope with a 97 beam shows two components at @xmath8 and @xmath9 with n()@xmath10 and n()@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "an nrao 140 foot telescope ( 43 meter ) observation with a 21  beam gives a column density that is 2.2 times higher than the effelsberg spectrum for the @xmath12172  component while both telescopes give identical results for the @xmath12133  component .",
    "the difference between the 97 and 21  results probably arises from small scale structure in the hvc , since it is much larger than any expected statistical uncertainties or calibration differences .",
    "we have used the effelsberg spectrum in the analysis that follows .    an h@xmath13  spectrum obtained by m. haffner ( private communication ) with the wham instrument",
    "@xcite indicates that the h@xmath13intensity associated with complex  c toward mrk 876 is @xmath14 r ( 1 r is 10@xmath15 photons@xmath16 ) averaged over the 1  beam of the instrument .",
    "complex  c is clearly detected in other directions ( wakker et al .",
    "1999 ; tufte et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ) which implies a patchy distribution of n(h@xmath1 ) .",
    "since both the distance to complex c and the geometry of the emitting region are unknown , and there may exist small scale structure in the large wham beam , no meaningful limit can be placed on n(h@xmath1 ) at this time .",
    "for a description of the _ fuse _ satellite , its operation , and observing modes see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mrk 876 dataset ( p1073101 ) consists of 10 consecutive exposures in the @xmath17 apertures , resulting in 52 ksec of on - target integration . at the time of the observations ( 16 october 1999 )",
    "the spectrograph was not yet aligned or focused .",
    "the target appears in both lif channels and one sic channel .",
    "the data were passed through the standard calfuse pipeline , which removed the spectral motion , performed a background subtraction , removed the geometric distortions , extracted the spectra , and performed wavelength and flux calibrations .",
    "event bursts were removed from the data by hand .",
    "coaddition of the channels was not attempted due to the preliminary nature of the wavelength calibration .",
    "typically , the equivalent width of an absorption line was measured separately for each channel and averaged .",
    "the typical spectral resolution was @xmath18 .",
    "the average s / n is 14:1 per resolution element in the lif1 channel , 17:1 in the lif2 channel , and 8:1 in the sic1 channel .",
    "the  lines are shown in figure 1 . absorption from hvc complex  c is clearly present at negative velocities as high as @xmath19 .",
    "is an excellent tracer of hot gas ( @xmath20 k ) and is not generally produced by photoionization .",
    "beyond @xmath19 the  1031.93   line is blended with the galactic ( 6 - 0 ) p(3 ) line at 1031.19  .",
    "fortunately , the  line is narrow and was easily removed from the spectrum . integrating the profile between @xmath19 and @xmath21 we find and equivalent width of @xmath22 m  which implies n()=@xmath23 if the line is optically thin .",
    "high velocity absorption is also seen in the  1037.62   line ; however , it is blended with the strong galactic ( 5 - 0 ) r(1 ) line at velocities more negative than @xmath24 , making a column density measurement impossible",
    ".    the amount of hot gas implied by the  detection can be significant if the metallicity of complex  c is low .",
    "the models of @xcite give the ionization fraction of  as function of temperature for gas in collisional equilibrium .",
    "at the peak of the  ionization fraction ( 22% at 280,000 k ) , the amount of hot gas is n(h)@xmath25 .    a discussion of the possible interpretations for the detection of high - velocity  in complex c and other hvcs is presented by @xcite .",
    "metal line absorption associated with the @xmath26  component ( and , in some cases , the @xmath27 component ) is seen in several  lines , , , and .",
    "upper limits can be set for , , and .",
    "example absorption lines are presented in figure 1 .",
    "table  1 lists the measured equivalent widths , column densities and derived abundances relative to the solar values .",
    "the errors are a combination in quadrature of the statistical error , based on the s / n ratio of the spectrum , and systematic errors calculated as the rms value of measurements made by different authors , by using different detector segments , different continuum placement , and by using subsets of the data ( e.g. night - only ) .",
    "five hvc  lines from the @xmath28 component are detected , from which a curve of growth can be derived .",
    "we minimize @xmath29(n,@xmath30)=[(observed)@xmath31(n,@xmath30)@xmath32 , and find n=3.0@xmath331.2  and @xmath30=12.1@xmath335.6 .",
    "all observed values of are then within 1@xmath34 of the expected value .",
    "we will use this @xmath30-value below to convert equivalent width to column density for other ions ( excluding ) .",
    "the @xmath12172 component is also seen in absorption in  @xmath351144.94 .",
    "the  @xmath351121.98 line from the @xmath28 component is absent , yielding n()/n()@xmath360.22 .    @xmath351083.99",
    "high - velocity absorption can clearly be seen in the sic1 channel ; however , the individual components are blended and the spectrum has low s / n .",
    "integrating the line and apparent column density profiles between @xmath12160 and @xmath12100  yields an equivalent width @xmath37120m  and a column density of n()@xmath38 .",
    "if we calculate the column density assuming the @xmath30 value found above for iron , the result is a factor of three higher .",
    "the high - velocity component of  @xmath351134.17 is blended with low - velocity  @xmath39 . using a curve of growth for the low velocity gas ,",
    "we derive ( @xmath351133.67)=67@xmath337m . the measured width of the blend is 94@xmath337m , so that 27@xmath3310m  can be attributed to high - velocity .",
    "this matches , to within the errors , the column density of  @xmath351199.55 found by @xcite toward mrk 876 using the space telescope imaging spectrograph on the _ hubble space telescope_.    @xmath351036.34 is clearly present in both components of the hvc and is strongly saturated . for  @xmath351152.82 and @xmath351048.22 only @xmath40 upper limits of 25m  can be set at this time .",
    "the observed ratio n()/n()@xmath41 ( fe / h)@xmath0 is unexpected given that every previously studied sightline through cool , warm , or halo gas has shown iron depleted by at least a factor 3 @xcite .",
    "if the intrinsic metallicity of complex  c is subsolar , then little , if any , iron can be depleted into dust grains .",
    "the iron abundance is also higher than the value of s / h@xmath420.1 ( s / h)@xmath0 found by @xcite along the mrk 290 sightline through complex  c. gibson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have measured absorption along the lines of sight to mrk 817 , where n()/n()=0.3 ( s / h)@xmath0 , and mrk 279 , where n()/n()@xmath420.6 ( s / h)@xmath0 .",
    "they find that assuming the presence of h@xmath1  along the line of sight is insufficient to reconcile their observations with the metallicity found by @xcite .",
    "instead , they believe that the metallicity of complex  c is spatially variable with metallicities ranging from @xmath43 solar . the low abundance of argon ( n()/n()@xmath44 ( ar / h)@xmath0 ) toward mrk 876 is probably a photoionization effect ;  has a photoionization cross - section about 10 times larger than that of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "upcoming _ fuse _ observations of the mrk 290 , mrk 817 , and mrk 279 sightlines should help resolve these issues .",
    "previous searches for molecular gas in high velocity clouds concentrated on tracers such as co and hco@xmath45 , which have spectral lines at millimeter wavelengths . @xcite and @xcite placed upper limits on n ( ) of @xmath46 and @xmath47 in several hvcs , respectively , assuming solar abundances and standard i(co ) to n ( ) ratios .",
    "@xcite have reported the discovery of  absorption at a velocity of + 120  with n()=@xmath48 in an _ orfeus _ spectrum of the lmc star hd 269546 ( sk@xmath126882 ) . however , this sightline is quite complicated , and has absorption associated with the milky way , the lmc , as well as the hvc .    _ fuse _ can observe the far uv electronic transitions of molecular hydrogen from both the lyman ( b  x ) and werner ( c  x ) bands at high resolution toward many extragalactic objects behind hvcs . toward mrk 876 ,",
    "absorption lines from  in the milky way are readily visible with n()@xmath49 @xcite .",
    "figure 2 compares the observed spectra and the expected absorption signatures of the two components of complex  c for an  column density of @xmath50 in each component and for a rotational temperature of t@xmath51 k and @xmath52 .",
    "the selected lines are the strongest  lines in the _ fuse _ bandpass that are not blended with other atomic or molecular lines .",
    "clearly , there is no detectable absorption from hvc complex  c. reasonable changes in t@xmath53 or @xmath30 do not alter this conclusion . since the most efficient mechanism for forming  is on the surfaces of dust grains @xcite , the non - detection of , coupled with the low depletion of iron",
    ", implies that there is little or no dust in complex  c along this line of sight .",
