    "the direct measurement of characteristic parameters of low dimensional semiconductor systems , from their optical spectra , requires an experimental technique sensitive enough to detect the singularities in the electronic density of states [ 1 - 4 ] . in superlattices ,",
    "optical detection of the van hove singularities associated with electronic minibands has been accomplished by measuring the absorption spectrum due to intraband transitions , in the far infrared wavelength range @xcite .",
    "interband optical methods , however , could not be used successfully to provide a direct measurement of the miniband width , due to the formation of saddle point excitons at the edges of the van - hove singularities @xcite , with a binding energy which is larger for the @xmath4 exciton than for the @xmath5 exciton , due to a negative electronic effective mass along the growth direction in the former case @xcite . in heavily doped superlattices ,",
    "exciton formation is suppressed , due to coulomb screening and phase - space filling . with sufficient doping",
    ", the fermi level will lay above the energy at top of the electronic miniband , and luminescence from miniband states below the fermi level should be observed .",
    "one drawback , however , is that often the pl of doped superlattices is completely dominated by transitions between localized tamm states , precluding the detection of interband transitions associated with extended miniband states @xcite .",
    "when the doping atoms are located in the inner barrier layers of the superlattice , the spatial separation between the electronic charge and the ionized donors gives rise to a strong bending of the band - edges at the boundaries of the superlattice , which causes a shift of the outer wells from resonance with the inner ones , and tamm states are formed ( for a survey on tamm states in superlattices see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "if the modulation - doping profile is tailored in order to avoid the formation of tamm states , then it should be possible to detect the miniband singularities by using interband photoluminescence ( pl ) spectroscopy . by solving the schroedinger and poisson equations",
    ", we found the formation of tamm states is avoided if , in addition to the inner barriers , doping atoms are also added to the outer layers of the superlattice , with an areal concentration about half the value used for the inner ones . in this work",
    "we report an investigation of a superlattice sample with such a doping profile , grown by molecular beam epitaxy , by photoluminescence in high magnetic fields .",
    "experiments showed that when the doping level is such that the miniband is fully populated , i.e. the fermi level lies above the @xmath4 singularity , luminescence between landau levels of the @xmath5 and @xmath4 valence and conduction band states can be detected .",
    "the miniband parameters can be obtained directly from the oscillations of the photoluminescence intensity as a function of magnetic field , which is described by a doublet of frequencies . by measuring the oscillation frequencies as a function of the photon energy",
    ", we can estimate the miniband energy width , the electron - hole pair reduced mass for in - plane movement , and the effective superlattice band gap .",
    "the superlattice band gap is lowered by the self - energy correction , arising from the electron exchange interaction , by an amount equal to the so - called _ band gap renormalization_@xcite ( bgr ) ; for a superlattice with @xmath6  @xmath3 electrons per period , our results show that the band gap is lowered by 23.4  mev .",
    "this value is intermediate between the band gap renormalization of 52  mev and 21  mev , estimated for a strictly two - dimensional or three - dimensional electron gas of equivalent density , respectively .",
    "the superlattice sample was grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) and consisted of 20 gaas quantum wells of 50   thickness , separated by 19 al@xmath0ga@xmath1as inner barriers of thickness 50  .",
    "measurement of low - angle x - ray reflectivity measurements confirmed the thickness of the layers .",
    "the internal algaas barriers were delta - doped with si at their center , with an areal density of @xmath7 @xmath3 .",
    "the outer algaas layers were delta - doped with half of the same areal concentration , at a distance of 25   from the adjacent gaas layer .",
    "shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) measurements of in - plane conductivity were made on approximately square samples , with contacts in the corners , using currents of @xmath8200 - 400 @xmath9a .",
    "pl measurements were done in the faraday geometry , using optical fibers and _ in situ _ miniature focusing optics .",
    "all measurements were done at 2k .",
    "figure 1 shows the fourier transform of the sdh oscillations for the superlattice sample , for a magnetic field applied normal to the surface of the sample .",
    "two peaks are observed , at @xmath10  t and @xmath11  t. these peaks are associated with the belly and neck extremal orbits in the mini - fermi surface @xcite , and can be labeled by the corresponding saddle points in the density of states , @xmath5 and @xmath4 . to demonstrate this association ,",
    "sdh measurements were done for a magnetic field direction tilted away from the normal to the surface of the sample . in tilted fields ,",
    "the two peaks show a characteristic behaviour of quasi - three dimensional electrons , whereby the @xmath5 and @xmath4 peaks cross over @xcite , as shown in figure 2 . according to onsager s quasiclassical quantization formula",
    ", the fourier frequencies in the sdh oscillations will be given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 are the extremal sections of the mini - fermi surface , hence for a parabolic electronic in - plane dispersion we obtain @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the electronic in - plane effective mass , @xmath16 is the fermi energy , and @xmath17 is the energy width of the miniband .",
    "the full and dashed lines shown in figure 2 are the theoretical @xmath5 and @xmath4 sdh frequencies , respectively , obtained from equation ( [ eq : onsager ] ) , by solving self - consistently the schroedinger and poisson equations , for an infinite al@xmath0ga@xmath1as / gaas superlattice , with all gaas and al@xmath0ga@xmath1as layers being of width 50 , and doped in the middle of the internal barriers with @xmath18  @xmath3 .",
    "the good agreement between theoretical and experimental fourier frequencies demonstrates the presence of electrons confined by a superlattice potential , in close agreement with the design parameters .",
    "the electronic effective mass , @xmath15 , was estimated from the temperature dependence of the amplitude of the sdh oscillations , giving @xmath19 .",
    "using the experimental values , @xmath19 , @xmath10  t and @xmath20  t , equation ( [ eq : onsager ] ) gives @xmath21  mev and @xmath22  mev .",
    "figure 3 shows the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectrum at @xmath23  k for the superlattice .",
    "a broad emission band is seen above the gaas gap , which is associated with recombinations between electrons and holes confined by the superlattice potential .",
    "the effective superlattice band gap , @xmath24 , the energy corresponding to @xmath25 , and the energy corresponding to @xmath26 , are shown in figure 3 ; these energies were estimated from the analysis below .    in order to demonstrate that the wide pl emission band shown in figure 3 arises from electron - hole recombinations by charge carriers confined by the superlattice potential ,",
    "the pl spectra were studied as a function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "figure 4 shows the pl intensity oscillations at fixed photon energies .",
    "the oscillations in the pl intensity , at a given photon energy @xmath27 , will be proportional to @xcite @xmath28\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summation is over electronic states , @xmath29 , that are situated below the fermi level , and over hole states , @xmath30 , that contain photoexcited holes .",
    "due to momentum conservation @xcite , transitions occur only if @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and we obtain @xmath33 \\label{eq : interm}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the electron and hole superlattice envelope wave functions , and @xmath9 is the reduced mass of the electron - hole pair . in the tight - binding approximation",
    "the electronic and hole miniband dispersion will be given by , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the period of the superlattice , and by following the steps described in @xcite , from equations ( [ eq : interm],[eq : tb ] ) we can obtain an analytical expression for the pl intensity oscillations : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an energy level broadening parameter .",
    "equation ( [ eq : plosc ] ) yields a doublet of frequencies of oscillation , associated with saddle points @xmath5 and @xmath4 , whose values are    @xmath40    figure 5 shows the oscillations in the pl intensity as a function of magnetic field for a photon energy of @xmath41  ev , and a theoretical fit to equation ( [ eq : plosc ] ) , including a monotonous parabolic background .",
    "the fitting procedure yields the values for @xmath42  t , and @xmath43  t.    the fitting procedure was repeated for all photon energies measured .",
    "figure 6 shows the frequencies of oscillations of the pl intensity in a magnetic field as a function of the photon energy .",
    "a linear dependence of the pl oscillation frequencies on the photon energy is obtained , in agreement with eq.([eq : freq ] ) .",
    "the straight lines depicted in figure  6 were obtained from a simultaneous linear fit of the two sets of data points with eq.([eq : freq ] ) .",
    "the fit yields the intersection of the lines with the energy axis , which according to eq.([eq : freq ] ) will occur at the energies @xmath44  ev and @xmath45  ev .",
    "the heavy - hole miniband energy width can be estimated theoretically from the solution of the schroedinger - poisson equations for the given structure , and we obtain @xmath46  mev , i.e. the hole dispersion can be ignored as a good approximation , hence we can deduce @xmath47  ev and @xmath48  mev .",
    "the latter parameter is in reasonable agreement with the electronic miniband width estimated from the shubnikov - de haas measurements , @xmath21  mev .",
    "the slope of the line determines the reduced effective mass of the electron - hole pair , i.e. @xmath49 . the estimated superlattice band gap , @xmath47  ev , can be compared to the theoretical value of the band gap , obtained from the @xmath50 equation for this structure , @xmath51  ev , which does not take into account the lowering of the band gap due to many body effects . by equating @xmath52bgr , we obtain bgr@xmath53  mev . for an electron gas confined in two dimensions ,",
    "the band gap renormalization is @xcite bgr@xmath54  mev , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the exciton bohr radius and binding energy , respectively , and @xmath57  @xmath3 is the areal density of electrons in the well . for a strictly two - dimensional electron gas ,",
    "we substitute @xmath58 , and an exciton radius of @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the effective rydberg and effective bohr radius in bulk gaas , respectively , to obtain bgr@xmath62=52  mev .",
    "the finite thickness of the charges can be taken into account by calculating the exciton radius and binding energy for a 50  gaas / al@xmath0as@xmath1as quantum well , as described in refs @xcite , to give @xmath63  mev and @xmath64   , in which case bgr@xmath65  mev .",
    "finally , in the bulk the bgr is given by @xcite bgr@xmath66^{1/4}$ ] , where @xmath67 is the equivalent bulk carrier concentration , which gives bgr@xmath68  mev .",
    "thus , we find a bgr that is slightly larger than in the bulk , but is less than the bgr for a quasi two - dimensional system .    in conclusion ,",
    "superlattice structures of gaas / algaas composition were produced , with a modulation doping profile that prevents the formation of tamm states .",
    "shubnikov - de haas measurements in tilted fields demonstrate the presence of electrons confined by a superlattice potential in close agreement with the design parameters .",
    "pl was studied in high magnetic fields , and a broad luminescence band was observed above the gaas band gap . for a fixed photon energy within this broad pl band , the intensity of the luminescence oscillates as a function of the magnetic field applied perpendicular to the superlattice layers .",
    "the pl oscillations are described by a doublet of frequencies , which show a linear dependence on the energy of the photon , showing that it is due to recombinations of electron - hole pairs confined by the superlattice potential . from the photoluminescence oscillations we can estimate superlattice parameters - the electronic miniband width @xmath17 , the electron - hole pair reduced mass , @xmath9 , and the band gap renormalization , which we find is less than the bgr for a quantum well of the same barrier composition and well thickness , but greater than the bgr for",
