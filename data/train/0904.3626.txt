    "it is known that nearly 20% of the total energy density of the present universe is dominated by the unknown non - relativistic matter , called dark matter ( dm ) @xcite .",

    "another way is to search for characteristic signatures of dm annihilation in the cosmic - ray flux , such as gamma - rays , positrons / electrons , anti - protons and neutrinos .",
    "interestingly enough , one clue to the dm may have been found in cosmic - ray signals .",
    "recent observation of the pamela satellite found a steep excess in the cosmic positron flux above the energy @xmath6  gev  @xcite .",
    "the atic balloon experiment also reported an excess in a sum of electron and positron flux whose peak energy is around 600  gev  @xcite .",
    "this steep excess was not confirmed by the fermi satellite  @xcite , but still there may be a deviation from the astrophysical background electron flux .",
    "these positron / electron excesses can be interpreted as a signal of dm annihilation , and this possibility was discussed in many literature  @xcite . in these scenarios , the annihilation cross section which is two or three orders of magnitude larger than the canonical value ( @xmath7 ) , which reproduces a correct relic dm abundance under thermal freeze out scenario ,",
    "is required .",
    "one way to incorporate this is to rely on unknown clumpy structure of dm halo in the galaxy .",
    "if dm forms a small scale clumps , dm - originated positron / electron flux can be enhanced .",
    "such an enhancement is characterized by a so - called boost factor @xmath8 , and if @xmath8 reaches to @xmath9 , the pamela / fermi results can be reproduced within the canonical value of dm annihilation cross section .",
    "however , one needs not introduce a large boost factor if one extends a dm generation mechanism to a non - thermal production  @xcite .",
    "in such cases , the dm annihilation cross section can take a large value while accounting for the present dm abundance .",
    "this latter possibility is interesting because indirect detection signatures are also generically enhanced  @xcite .    motivated by the recent pamela / fermi observations , we investigate gamma - ray signatures from dm annihilation scenario . in particular ,",
    "the study of diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray background in the context of recent anomalous positron flux was missed in the literature . at first sight , dm annihilation may not seem to contribute significantly to diffuse extragalactic component because gamma - ray flux from dm annihilation is proportional to the square of dm density , and dm density in intergalactic space is so low .",
    "however , taking into account dm annihilation inside the external galaxies and clumpy objects leads to a great enhancement , which can compensate the quite dilute dm density @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "we find that diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray background gives a stringent constraint on dm annihilation models which account for the pamela / fermi anomaly .",
    "the forthcoming fermi satellite experiment will soon provide more useful constraints in a similar way @xcite , and hence it is important to reconsider diffuse gamma - ray bounds on dm annihilation models .",

    "according to recent studies  @xcite , the constraint is relaxed by two or three orders of magnitude .",
    "thus it may also give comparable constraints with gamma - rays .",
    "extragalactic radio emission due to the cosmological dm annihilation taking into account the effects of dm clustering , similar to the context given in this paper , was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this study",
    "we have assumed that the dm annihilation proceeds via @xmath144-wave process and it is time - independent , i.e. , @xmath145 is a constant . in general , however , it could depend on the dm velocity .",
    "especially , there are some dm models where the annihilation cross section scales as @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "it was discussed that in such case the gamma - ray contribution from the smallest halo formed in the earliest epoch is most important since the velocity dispersion of dm in such halos are small and the annihilation rate is significantly enhanced  @xcite .",
    "bbn may also give stringent constraints since the velocity dispersion of dm in the bbn era is small .",
