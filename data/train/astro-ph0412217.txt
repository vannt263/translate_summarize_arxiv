    "ubiquitous small - scale fluctuations of the magnetic field and the velocity may be responsible for the stokes asymmetries for the intensity , @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the two independent types of linear polarization , and @xmath5 for the circular polarization .",
    "the stokes profiles are the function stokes parameter versus wavelength for a particular spectral line .",
    "these stokes profiles are expected to be symmetric or anti - symmetric when the line is formed in a homogeneous atmosphere , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "deviations from these symmetries are called stokes asymmetries . ]",
    "observed in all photospheric magnetic structures .",
    "if the spatial scale is small enough to be optically - thin , one has a very efficient source of line asymmetry .",
    "the existence of such gradients was conjectured by @xcite , that coined the acronym misma to describe magnetic atmospheres having optically - thin irregularities ( misma  @xmath6  micro - structured magnetic atmosphere ) .",
    "if the conjecture turns out to be correct , we must understand the magnetic micro - structure for two fundamental reasons .",
    "first , many physical processes determining the magnetism at all scales take place at micro - scales ( e.g. , ohmic diffusion , advection , onset of instabilities , viscous stresses , etc . ) .",
    "second , it plays a key role for the proper interpretation of the magnetic field measurements , which are prone to bias if the micro - structure is overlooked .",
    "( for a more elaborated discussion on these two reasons , see @xcite . )",
    "this paper is the third of a series aimed at examining the conjecture in detail .",
    "we wanted to see ( a ) whether the observed asymmetries can be quantitatively explained by mismas , and ( b ) what are the physical properties of the micro - structure .",
    "the first paper introduces an inversion code ( ic ) based on the misma concept .",
    "it is a ( fairly ) automatic algorithm to fit stokes profiles using synthetic profiles formed in atmospheres with optically - thin micro - structure ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  i ) . as a test case ,",
    "paper  i   reproduces the asymmetries found in plage regions by @xcite .",
    "the second paper describes the successful application of the ic to quiet sun network and inter - network regions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  ii ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the present paper extends the misma inversions to a sunspot , showing that the micro - structure is also able to cope with the stokes asymmetries of sunspots .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the properties of the spectro - polarimetric data subject to analysis are summarized in ",
    "[ observations ] .",
    "section  [ sec_inv ] describes the constraints used to set up the model mismas , the quality of the fits , and the procedure to assemble independent inversions from different pixels into a single coherent structure .",
    "the main results are set forth in the seven subsections of ",
    "specific aspects of the resulting model sunspot are examined in   [ mfc_sect ] ( magnetic flux conservation ) and   [ mass ] ( mass conservation ) . section   [ role ] explains the physical origin of the asymmetries from a radiative transfer point of view . finally ,   [ conclusions ] comments on and summarizes the contents of the paper .",
    "the interpretation of these results in the context of the global penumbral magnetic field topology is deferred for a separate paper @xcite .",
    "we have preferred to disconnect the fact that mismas account for the stokes asymmetries in sunspots ( this work ) , from the more speculative physical interpretation of the retrieved micro - structure .",
    "even if the physical interpretation is eventually proved to be wrong , the micro - structure would still account for the asymmetries .",
    "the stokes @xmath7 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 profiles analyzed in this work were obtained by @xcite with the advanced stokes polarimeter ( asp ; * ? ? ?",
    "they correspond to the sunspot in active region noaa  7912 ( fig .",
    "[ cont_image ] ) observed on 1995 october 15 when passing close to the solar disk center ( s5 , e9 , cosine of heliocentric angle @xmath8 ) .",
    "the region was scanned with a step - size of 075 in the east - west direction , perpendicular to the slit .",
    "the pixel size along the spectrograph slit 0  37 , is enough to sample a seeing close to ( but better than ) 1 . the field - of - view ( fov )",
    "is set by the length of the slit , and the size of the scan , and it turns out to be 85  @xmath9135 .",
    "the asp provides the polarization of  @xmath06301.5    and  @xmath06302.5     every 12.8  m .",
    "an integration time per slit position of 10  sec affords a noise per spectral pixel better than @xmath10 times the continuum intensity .",
    "the spectra are corrected for instrumental polarization to a level below this noise @xcite . for further details on the observational setup and the target , refer to @xcite .",
    "we use this rather old data set because its image quality was among the best asp maps available when the work began in 1999 .",
    "the sunspot has negative polarity , i.e. , the magnetic field lines are anti - parallel to the vertical direction at the umbral core .",
    "this fact introduces some minor complications in the interpretation of the sunspot magnetic field .",
    "they will be pointed out and clarified whenever they interfere with our argumentation .",
    "the zero of the absolute velocity scale has been set using the stokes @xmath5 zero - crossing wavelengths in the plage around the sunspot .",
    "we use its mean position as null velocity .",
    "the same procedure was used in paper  ii  since observations have shown that the zero - crossing wavelengths of stokes @xmath5 profiles in plage are very close to the laboratory wavelengths of the lines @xcite . the systematic error of our absolute velocities should be less than 0.25  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "we employ the scenario proposed in @xcite , which resembles a scaled - down version of the _ uncombed fields _ of @xcite .",
    "the atmosphere has two magnetic components which differ in velocity , inclination , as well as in many other physical parameters .",
    "it is a misma , therefore , each line - of - sight   crosses several different substructures ( see the schematic in fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] ) .",
    "since we will use the inversion code  ( ic ) by @xcite , these two components meet several physical requirements .    1 .   [ item2 ]",
    "the temperature of the two magnetic components is the same at every geometrical height .",
    "we adopt this approach for consistency , since the radiative exchange among the optically - thin micro - structures of the misma should efficiently smooth temperatures in seconds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "[ item1 ] in addition to the two magnetic components , there is a third non - magnetic component .",
    "it is introduced for technical reasons and plays no central role . as we will see (   [ ocf_sect ] ) , the fraction of photospheric volume that it occupies within the sunspot is always marginal .",
    "[ item3 ] the three components are in lateral pressure balance at every geometrical height ( i.e. , they have the same total pressure , which is the sum of the gas pressure plus the magnetic pressure ) .",
    "this constraint and the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium along field lines provide the full vertical stratification of magnetic field strengths from the strengths at one height .",
    "the field strengths of the different components are different .",
    "[ item6 ] the two magnetic components have different inclinations with respect to the vertical direction , but the same azimuth",
    ". inclinations and azimuths do not vary with height in the atmosphere .",
    "[ item4 ] only motions along magnetic field lines are allowed .",
    "the mass conservation along field lines determines the velocity stratification by setting the velocity at a given height .",
    "[ item5 ] unpolarized stray light is accounted for .",
    "dealing with stray light introduces three free parameters : the fraction of stray light , a global velocity , and a microturbulence .",
    "the thermodynamic stratification is that of the non - magnetic component of the misma model atmosphere .",
    "the actual model atmospheres are described using 23 parameters : the temperature of the non - magnetic component at four heights , a global scaling factor for the temperature of the magnetic components ( item [ item2 ] above ) , two magnetic field strengths at the bottom of the atmosphere ( or bid , which stands for bottom of integration domain ) ( item  [ item3 ] ) , two occupation fractions at bid ( i.e. , the fraction of atmospheric volume occupied by each magnetic component ; item  [ item1 ] ) , two velocities at bid ( item  [ item4 ] ) , two magnetic field inclinations ( item  [ item6 ] ) , one magnetic field azimuth ( item  [ item6 ] ) , four parameters to define the distribution of microturbulent velocities ( two for the magnetic components , and two for the non - magnetic component ) , three parameters to account for the stray light ( item [ item5 ] ) , one macro - turbulent velocity ( which simulates instrumental broadening plus macro - turbulence of solar origin ) and , finally , the maximum pressure at bid . the latter varies to assure that the model atmosphere embraces the region between @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 the continuum optical depth at 6302  ) .",
    "this range of optical depths guarantees that the lines  @xmath06302.5    and  @xmath06301.5     are entirely formed within the bounds of the model atmosphere .",
    "recovery of the complete atmospheric structure from these 23 parameters is described in @xcite .",
    "these 23 parameters must be set during the least - squares fitting procedure .",
    "although the number of free parameters seems large , it has to be compared with the 536 different observed quantities to be fitted ( 67 wavelengths per line and per stokes parameter ; see fig .",
    "[ show_fit ] ) .",
    "these observables are not fully independent ( e.g. , the finite spectral resolution links neighbor wavelengths , and the radiative transfer couples the four stokes parameters ) , but the author believes that the number of observables is so large compared with the number of free parameters that the number of _ independent _ observables almost certainly exceeds 23 .",
    "figure  [ cartoon ] illustrates the kind of complex distribution of magnetic field lines that our schematic model mismas may be modeling .",
    "field lines like these are represented by our ic as , e.g. , the model misma in fig",
    ".  [ model_misma ] .",
    "if the micro - structure of the atmosphere is optically - thin then the emerging spectrum does not depend on details of the atmosphere but only on its average properties @xcite .",
    "therefore , describing a messy bunch of field lines with only two components is consistent with our misma assumption .",
    "obviously , we can not infer details of the micro - structure but volume average properties .",
    "in particular , we are insensitive to the size of the micro - structures , which we consider to be optically - thin and so smaller than 100 km . the cartoon in fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] represents magnetic field lines existing in a single resolution element .",
    "the field lines are aligned approximately radially from the sunspot center , having different azimuths and inclinations .",
    "figure  [ cartoon]a shows a view from the top of the 3-dimensional distribution of field lines .",
    "they show a global radial orientation but , due to slight misalignments and swings , many different field lines overlap along any line - of - sight .",
    "the axes , given in mm , are for guidance only .",
    "figure  [ cartoon]b represents a side view of the same distribution of field lines .",
    "different magnetic field inclinations coexist in the resolution elements .",
    "a. the different panels represent the variation with height in the atmosphere of various physical parameters ( from left to right and from top to bottom ) : the continuum optical depth , the magnetic field strength , the temperature , the gas pressure , the density , the electron pressure , the occupation fraction , and the speed along field lines . except for the upper - left panel ,",
    "the type of line identifies the three components of the model misma ; the solid lines correspond to the non - magnetic component and the dotted and dashed lines to the magnetic components .",
    "the diamonds indicate the free parameters of the model , from which the entire stratification of the atmosphere has been deduced .",
    "note that the atmosphere is only meaningful within the range of optical depths where the observed lines are formed ( e.g. , the drop of major component magnetic field strength below @xmath14 is not significant ; @xmath14 occurs at 100  km ) . ]",
    "the misma scenario and the requirements used for sunspot inversions are basically those that successfully reproduce the stokes profiles observed in plage , network and internetwork regions @xcite . the main difference being the inclination of the magnetic fields , and the different temperatures of the magnetic components and the background . the similarities between scenarios probably reflects both the degeneracy of the radiative transfer for mismas and the fact that the employed misma scenario grasps the essential degrees of freedom required to reproduce most asymmetries found in the photosphere .",
    "as explained above , there are two magnetic component in each model misma .",
    "they will be denoted as minor and major depending on which one has largest @xmath15 , i.e. , the largest product of occupation fraction @xmath16 times density @xmath17 .",
    "consequently , the major component is the one containing most of the mass of the atmosphere .",
    "this intuitive classification is also used in paper  ii . here , however",
    ", the component of largest @xmath15 may change along the atmosphere , making the definition ambiguous .",
    "fortunately , the change occurs in a small fraction of inversions ( 3% ) and , even in these cases , it only affects a few superficial layers .",
    "( the classification is based on @xmath15 at the bottom of the atmosphere . )      first , the center of the sunspot was set by trial and error .",
    "we minimize the departures from axi - symmetry of the distribution of observed continuum intensities .",
    "the chosen center is 1.3 mm away from the darkest point in the umbra .",
    "the resulting intensity distribution is fairly symmetric , leading to a sunspot radius of about 17  mm , which is the value adopted in the paper .",
    "we choose for inversion all those pixels within 24  mm from the sunspot center having a degree of polarization larger than 0.5% ( average polarization over a bandpass 75  m  wide in the blue wing of  @xmath06302.5   ) .",
    "this criterion yields 10130 different pixels encompassing the entire sunspot ( fig .",
    "[ cont_image ] ) .",
    "we have carried out an inversion for each one of these pixels using the ic described in paper  i  and the scenario presented in   [ scenario ] .",
    "the strategy for inversion is slightly different from the one in paper  ii .",
    "we also begin by classifying all stokes profiles using a principal component analysis scheme .",
    "this procedure sorts the observed stokes profiles according to similarities in shape .",
    "we start the inversion at the sunspot center , and then proceed with the closest profile according the classification .",
    "however , rather than using the last retrieved atmosphere to initialize each new inversion , we look up in a data base with all previously inverted synthetic profiles .",
    "the atmosphere of the closest one ( in a least squares sense ) is chosen for initialization .",
    "the process is repeated to completion of the 10130 sets of stokes profiles .",
    "each automatic inversion was visually inspected before acceptance .",
    "failures were re - started from a different model atmosphere until the agreement was satisfactory .",
    "figure [ show_fit ] shows four examples of the quality of the fits provided by the misma inversions .",
    "we have chosen the stokes profiles at four positions on the sunspot , ( a ) limb - side penumbra , ( b ) umbra , ( c ) center - side penumbra , and ( d ) outside the penumbral border defined by the continuum image ( the letters correspond to the labels on the figure , whereas limb - side and center - side refer to the portion of penumbra closest to or farthest from the solar limb ) .",
    "these four regions produce stokes profiles with the variety of shapes to be reproduced with the inversions , including severe stokes asymmetries .",
    "the stokes @xmath5 profile in fig .",
    "[ show_fit]a shows the so - called cross - over effect @xcite , with stokes @xmath5 having three or more lobes .",
    "it occurs in the neutral line , where the mean magnetic field is perpendicular to the line - of - sight , and stokes @xmath5 should be zero if the magnetic field were spatially resolved @xcite . despite the quality of the fits , we would like to point out that they are not as good as for the quiet sun network and internetwork profiles described in paper  ii  and @xcite .",
    "we have not been able to pin down the cause , however , it obviously implies that the scenario adopted for inversion suits better the conditions in the quiet sun .",
    "yet another hint of the quality of the fits is provided by the ability to reproduce the observed net circular polarization , a result analyzed in detail in   [ ncp_sect ] .",
    "a rotation of the magnetic field vector by 180@xmath18 about the line - of - sight  does not modify the zeeman absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this leads to the well known azimuthal ambiguity of the magnetic field derived from zeeman magnetometry , which has to sorted out before proceeding . since the misma model atmospheres have two magnetic components (   [ scenario ] ) , each one with this 180@xmath18 ambiguity , each pixel has four different magnetic configurations compatible with the observation ) . having varying azimuths and inclinations would make the ambiguity intractable .",
    "second , the doppler shifts only depend on the projection of the velocity along the line - of - sight .",
    "since we assume magnetic - field - aligned motions , all these four solutions have the same velocity along the line - of - sight  and therefore are compatible with the inferred velocity field . ] . among them , we chose the one that best fits in a global magnetic field that converges toward the sunspot core , and is as smooth as possible .",
    "first , we begin with the major components of all pixels ( i.e. , with the components containing most of the mass ; see  [ scenario ] ) .",
    "the smoothest solution is obtained after an iterative procedure where the direction of the magnetic field vector in a given pixel is compared with the direction of the mean field provided by the surrounding pixels .",
    "then the solution closest to the mean direction is chosen .",
    "this procedure is applied to each pixel and then iterated to a point where no pixel over the full fov has to be modified .",
    "the iterative procedure starts by choosing that solution representing a magnetic field converging toward the sunspot core ( see fig .",
    "[ schematic2 ] ) . if the two solutions of a pixel are of this kind , then the closest to the sunspot radial direction is chosen .",
    "we tried various box sizes to compute the local average ( from 3@xmath93  pixels to 15@xmath915  pixels ) .",
    "the disambiguation of the sunspot magnetic field is almost insensitive to this parameter , which mostly affects the field outside the visible sunspot .",
    "we finally adopted 10@xmath910 pixels , which provides a fair compromise .",
    "once the map of the major component is retrieved , we choose that minor component solution whose direction is closest to the major component direction . the algorithm sketched above provides a fairly axi - symmetric magnetic field distribution centered at the sunspot core inferred from the continuum intensity .",
    "figure [ inc_az_image ] shows maps of inclination and azimuth for the major components .",
    "figure [ inc_az_image2 ] shows the same maps for the minor components .",
    "each pixel has been inverted independently from the rest .",
    "therefore each one has its own scale of heights .",
    "part of the analysis of the forthcoming sections becomes more meaningful when carried out in a common scale of heights for the whole sunspot .",
    "we have set such common scale assuming that the total pressure ( gas pressure plus magnetic pressure ) is similar among neighbor pixels .",
    "( this approach was successfully applied in paper  ii ;   4.2 . )",
    "the absolute vertical scale of each pixel is set by comparison with the pressure of the nearest neighbors whose absolute scale is already known .",
    "we minimize the differences between the logarithms of the total pressures allowing only for a global shift of the scale of heights .",
    "the procedure starts at the center of the sunspot and then continues to the penumbral border , and beyond .",
    "the zero of the absolute scale is set by the layer @xmath19 in the stray light component of the model atmospheres far from the sunspot ( further than 23  mm ; see fig .",
    "[ cont_image ] ) .",
    "theses model atmospheres represent the non - magnetic sun so that the absolute heights are referred to the base of the non - magnetic photosphere . the uncertainty introduced by the assumption that the total pressure does not change between adjacent pixels is discussed in appendix [ appa ] . it is smaller than @xmath20  km for determining the wilson depression of the umbra , and it becomes negligible small when computing pixel - to - pixel variations ( @xmath21  km ) .",
    "as described in   [ scenario ] , the model mismas used for inversion have three different components , two magnetic plus a non - magnetic background , item  # [ item5 ] ) .",
    "the stray light component will not be discussed in the paper since it shows a rather expected behavior similar to the non - magnetic stray light component deduced from the milne - eddington inversions of the same sunspot .",
    "the stray light fill factor goes from 2  % in the umbral core to 25  % at the penumbral border . ] .",
    "the _ occupation fraction _ ( ocf ) is the fraction of atmospheric volume occupied by each one of them . in principle",
    "the ocfs vary with height in the atmosphere ( paper  i ) .",
    "however , height variations are expected only when the ocf of the background differs from zero , since the magnetic ocfs grow at the expense of non - magnetic volume .",
    "since the ocf of the background is very small ( see below ) , the ocf of the magnetic components remains basically constant with height .",
    "figure [ ocf1 ] shows the retrieved ocfs as a function of the radial distance from the sunspot center .",
    "we plot the values at the height in the atmosphere where @xmath22 , an optical depth where most of the atmospheric information extracted from the inversion comes from .",
    "the shaded areas represent plus and minus one standard deviation among all the points at the same radial distance .",
    "note that the major component has the largest ocf all the way from the umbra to the sunspot surroundings .",
    "this result is not a trivial consequence of the definition of major and minor , since the definition also involves mass densities (   [ scenario ] ) .",
    "the major component ocf goes from more than 90% in the umbra to about 70% in the outer penumbra ( the solid line in fig .",
    "[ ocf1 ] ) .",
    "the minor component is significantly different from zero only outside the umbra ( from 5  mm on ; fig .",
    "[ ocf1 ] , the dashed line ) .",
    "it occupies 30% of the penumbral volume .",
    "figure [ inc_az_image ] shows inclinations and azimuths of the major component .",
    "figure [ inc_az_image2 ] shows maps of the same parameters for the minor component .",
    "the actual values are better appreciated in fig .",
    "[ inc_az ] , where we represent the mean azimuths and inclinations , as well as the standard deviation of these quantities among those points at the same distance from the sunspot center .",
    "( for a visual definition of vertical inclination and relative azimuth , see fig .",
    "[ schematic1 ] . ) both the major component and ( to less extent ) the minor component follow the radial direction .",
    "the relative azimuth with respect to the radial direction is of the order of 180@xmath18 , as it should be for a radial magnetic field in a negative polarity sunspot ( fig .",
    "[ inc_az]b ) .",
    "( the properties of the minor component for distances smaller than 5  mm are excluded .",
    "the minor component of these points does not contribute to the observed signals and therefore , any inference based on it results unreliable . )",
    "the magnetic field inclination of the major component follows a variation with radial position typical of sunspots ( from say , 170@xmath18 at the sunspot core , to about 15@xmath18 off the horizontal at the sunspot boundary ; see .",
    ", e.g. , fig .  9 in @xcite ) .",
    "together with this smooth and expected behavior , the minor component is ( with large scatter but beyond any doubt ) always less inclined than the horizontal ( see the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ inc_az]a ) .",
    "we deal with a negative polarity sunspot and , therefore , visualizing the magnetic topology from the inclination is not so straightforward .",
    "the cartoon in fig .",
    "[ schematic3 ] has been laid out to illustrate the magnetic topology .",
    "this inclination of the minor component is common to the whole penumbra , implying that magnetic field lines are returning to the solar interior over the entire penumbra .",
    "this is possibly the biggest surprise of these misma inversions . as we will discuss in connection with the mass flows (   [ evershed ] )",
    ", inferences of magnetic fields returning to the sub - photosphere at the outer penumbra and beyond do exist in the literature @xcite .",
    "the presence of magnetic field lines that return throughout the penumbra is new , though .",

    "( the field strength of the minor component in the umbra is not included since its occupation fraction is negligible and therefore its value dubious ;   [ ocf_sect ] . )",

    "the observed variation is typical of sunspots ( e.g. , fig .",

    "more interesting is the systematic difference of field strength between components .",
    "the mean field strength of the minor component is about 200  g larger than that of the major component .",
    "this excess is significant .",
    "the dispersion among the field strengths of all the pixels at a radial distance is also of the order of 200  g ( the shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ mfs_fig ] ) .",
    "the dispersion of the mean is reduced by a factor square root of the number of pixels contributing to each radial point .",
    "typically , several hundred pixels contribute to the mean so that the uncertainty of the mean is only a few tens of g , and so , well below the observed 200  g difference .",
    "the error bars of the mean are also included in fig .",
    "[ mfs_fig ] , but they go almost unnoticed due to their small values .",
    "the excess of field strength creates a surplus of magnetic pressure and , consequently , a deficit of gas pressure in the minor component .",
    "let us assume that the minor and major components of the same or neighbor resolution elements are connected by field lines .",
    "( we have not been able to come up with any other possibility to understand the presence of field lines pointing up and down throughout the penumbra .",
    "however , this connection between the field lines of the minor and major components does not result from the inversions and is speculative . )",
    "then the gradient of gas pressure between minor and major components is bound to drive a mass flow .",
    "this is nothing but the siphon flow mechanism invoked to explain the evershed flow @xcite .",

    "a large fraction of the sunspot magnetic flux emerges in the penumbra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "to our surprise , the model sunspot turns out to have very little vertical magnetic flux across the penumbra .",
    "our finding does not imply a shallow penumbra , though .",
    "it follows from the large amount of return flux in the penumbra .",
    "the two magnetic components tend to have vertical magnetic field strengths with opposite signs (   [ sect_inc ] and figs .",

    "in particular , we are not sensitive to the size of the individual micro - structures forming each component ( but the micro - structures are optically - thin and so thinner than say 100  km ) . by assembling the results of all 10130 inversions , we set up a model sunspot with micro - structure .",

    "we need to distinguish between the minor and the major magnetic components in each resolution element .",
    "the major component is the one having most of the mass .",
    "this terminology allows us to describe the micro - structure of the magnetic fields and the mass flows as follows ;    1 .",
    "the magnetic fields of the minor and the major components have very different inclinations , with the major component being more vertical than the minor component . actually , the field lines of the minor component bend over to return to the sub - photosphere .",
    "this return of magnetic field lines occurs over the entire penumbra , rather than at the outer penumbra (   [ sect_inc ] ; fig .",
    "[ inc_az]a ) .",

    "the magnetic field lines and mass flows are always parallel .",
    "consequently , the minor component carries downflows . according to our inversions , both upflows and downflows",
    "are present everywhere on the penumbra .",
    "the velocities along field lines are small for the major component ( several hundred m  s@xmath1 ) , and large for the minor component ( 10  km  s@xmath1 ; see fig .",

    ", the major component has mass densities similar to the unmagnetized photosphere .",
    "the densities of the minor component are five times smaller (   [ sdensity ] ) .",
    "4 .   the minor component occupies a small fraction of the atmosphere ( about 30% of the penumbra , to become absent in the umbra ;   [ ocf_sect ] and fig .",
    "[ ocf1 ] ) .",
    "5 .   despite the large difference of velocity , the flows of the major and the minor components transport very similar masses (   [ mass ] ) . in particular",
    ", there is almost no vertical transport of mass since the mass involved in upflows and downflows tends to be balanced .",
    "the minor component has magnetic field strengths 10% larger than the major component .",
    "if connected by field lines , the resulting difference of magnetic pressure can lead to a siphon flow from the major component to the minor component whose magnitude is similar to the observed evershed flow (   [ mfs ] )",

    "this result produces a considerable difference between the signed and unsigned magnetic fluxes of the sunspot (   [ mfs ] ) .",
    "the model sunspot has a wilson depression of @xmath64  mm at the solar disk center , and it significantly increases toward the limb (   [ sect_wilson ] ) .",
    "counter - intuitive as it may sound , the presence of field lines pointing up and down over the entire penumbra does not obviously conflict with existing observations .",
    "we have carried out several tests to check the internal consistency of the retrieved model sunspot .",
    "* the misma inversions account for the asymmetries of the stokes profiles with a magnetic field vector * b * which does not violate the @xmath2 condition (   [ mfc_sect ] ) .",
    "* although , the model sunspot has a wilson depression smaller than the typical values found in the literature , it reproduces the observables from which large wilson depressions are inferred (   [ sect_wilson ] ) .",
    "* the model sunspot reproduces the net circular polarization ( ncp ) of the observed lines , including their rules .",
    "in addition , it also reproduces the abnormal behavior of the ncp of  @xmath015648   , discovered and explained by schlichenmaier and co - workers using magnetic structures larger than the ones implicit in the misma assumption (   [ ncp_sect ] ) . * when the observed stokes profiles are interpreted assuming a single magnetic component per resolution element , one finds upflows in the inner penumbra and downflows in the outer penumbra (   [ evershed ] ; fig .",
    "[ evershed4 ] ) .",
    "these upflows and downflows appear in the recent penumbral literature . according to our interpretation ,",
    "they are artificially produced when the unresolved structure of the flows is neglected (   [ evershed ] ) .",
    "it would be similar to the well known convective blueshift of the non - magnetic granulation , which does not correspond to a true systematic motion .",
    "* despite of the partial cancellation of vertical magnetic flux in the penumbra , some net magnetic flux remains .",
    "the existence of such residual flux avoids an obvious disagreement of the model sunspot with existing observations .",
    "chromospheric and coronal images often show fieldlines connecting the penumbra with magnetic structures far away from the sunspot ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* the minor component contributes to the emerging spectrum despite the fact that they contain a minute fraction of the total penumbral mass ( 5% or less ) .",
    "such a disproportionate effect results from the large doppler shifts associated with the minor components , which absorb in the wings of the major component absorption profiles (   [ role ] ) .",
    "the interpretation of all these results in the context of a coherent sunspot magnetic structure is deferred for a separate paper @xcite .",
    "we prefer to disconnect the fact that mismas account for the stokes asymmetries observed in sunspots ( this work ) , from the more speculative physical interpretation of the retrieved micro - structure .",
    "even if the physical interpretation is eventually shown to be wrong , mismas would still account for the asymmetries .",
    "only one general remark concerning the global magnetic structure will be made .",
    "the mass flows and magnetic fluxes of the minor and major components are surprisingly similar .",
    "this suggests a physical connection between them , so that field lines and flows emerging as the major component return to the photosphere as the minor component of the same or a neighbor resolution element .",
    "this possibility is not a direct result of the misma inversion , and it is put forward as a mere conjecture .",
    "the picture that emerges from our sunspot inversions is in qualitative agreement with the original misma scenario for penumbrae put forward by @xcite    a final caveat is in order .",
    "the fact that our model sunspot reproduces the observed stokes asymmetries does not guarantee the accuracy of the model .",
    "however , that fact that a model sunspot reproduces the asymmetries should not be undervalued .",
    "if the model sunspot that accounts for real sunspots is eventually discovered , it will be found among those in this rare category of models reproducing the stokes asymmetries .",
