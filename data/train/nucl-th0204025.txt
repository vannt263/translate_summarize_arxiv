    "the pertinent question in the field of relativistic heavy - ion collisions is whether the physics at rhic is _ qualitatively different _ from the physics at sps . in our opinion ,",
    "the available experimental results hint that this is not the case , at least for soft processes .    in this paper",
    "we compile the transverse - momentum spectra of hadrons measured by various groups at sps and rhic .",
    "surprisingly , to our knowledge such a study has not been presented before .",
    "we use the data of na44 @xcite , na49 @xcite , phenix @xcite , and star @xcite , and show that there exist discrepancies between the na44 and the na49 data , as well as between the phenix and the star data . in fact , these discrepancies are of the same size as the differences between sps and rhic . more precisely , within the experimental uncertainties , which are quite large , one finds that the slopes of the @xmath0-spectra at rhic are compatible with those at sps .",
    "this observation is complementary to the well known fact of the very weak beam - energy dependence of the transverse hbt radii .",
    "similarity of both the transverse size and the of hadrons indicates that the amount of the transverse flow can not be significantly different at the two considered collision energies .",
    "the transverse hbt radii @xmath5 and @xmath6 measured @xcite in the first run of rhic are very close to those measured in heavy - ion collisions at smaller beam energies .",
    "only the longitudinal radius @xmath7 exhibits a monotonic growth with @xmath8 ( for a compilation of the data at different energies see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the weak energy dependence of the transverse radii is surprising , since the rhic beam energy , @xmath9 gev , is almost one order of magnitude larger than the sps energy , @xmath8 = 17 gev , and one would naively expect that much larger hadronic systems were produced at rhic .",
    "one would also expect a longer lifetime of the hadronic fireball formed at rhic , which should be reflected in a longer emission times of pions .",
    "this effect is quantified by the measurement of the ratio @xmath10 , which is expected to be much larger than unity for long emission duration @xcite .",
    "the experimental measurements indicate , however , that @xmath10 is compatible with unity in the whole range of the studied transverse - momentum range ( @xmath11 gev ) .",
    "this fact is another puzzle delivered by the analysis of the rhic data .",
    "on the other hand , the first measurements at rhic showed that the pseudorapidity densities of charged particles are higher than those observed at sps .",
    "can this effect be reconciled with practically unchanged transverse radii ? for the most central collisions , phobos communicated the value @xmath12 @xcite , brahms the value @xmath13 , whereas phenix obtained @xmath14 @xcite . normalizing per participant pair yields @xmath15 for both phobos and brahms , and @xmath16 for phenix .",
    "these numbers may be compared to the na49 result , 1.9 @xcite , and the wa98 result , 2.6 @xcite .",
    "we can see that the multiplicity increases by about 50% when we move from sps to rhic .",
    "a simple geometric scaling suggests that the transverse radius increases , correspondingly , as a square root , _ i.e. _ , by about 20% .",
    "thus , the observed increase of the multiplicity translates to moderately small increase of the transverse radii .",
    "clearly , the difference between the na49 multiplicity and the wa98 multiplicity , as well as the errors of each particular experiment lead to the uncertainty in the determination of the geometric parameters .    the weak dependence of @xmath5 from sps to rhic means that the transverse size of the firecylinder changes very little .",
    "if this is the fact , than the amount of the transverse hydrodynamic flow should also be similar , since it is difficult to imagine that a much stronger flow would lead to the same transverse size at freeze - out . to the contrary , the star results for the @xmath0-spectra have been interpreted as an indication of a much stronger flow at rhic .",
    "below we redo the simple analysis of the hadronic spectra and show that the errors in the flow parameter are very large , such that one can not definitely conclude that the flow is stronger at rhic .",
    "moreover , the phenix data suggest a much lower flow than star , such that it becomes compatible with the flow at sps , as obtained from na44 and na49 .",

    "in fig .  1 we plot the @xmath0-spectra of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , in fig .",
    "2 we show the @xmath0-spectra of @xmath4 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the collected data come from the measurements done at midrapidity for the most central events @xcite . a striking feature of fig .",
    "1 is a very impressive agreement between different experiments for the pions . in the range",
    "0.4 @xmath27 1.0 gev , the data from na49 coincide with the data from phenix and star , whereas the data from na44 show the same slope with a slightly smaller normalization due to a different centrality choice ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "a very similar @xmath0-dependence is also seen in the spectra of kaons , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 measured by different experiments . in this case , however , a different normalization of the spectra between sps and rhic data is clearly seen . in fig . 2",
    "one can clearly see similarities in the shapes of the pion as well as the kaon spectra measured by na44 and phenix .    if the plots for mesons and baryons were overlaid ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite ) , one could see that the phenix data have the property that the @xmath0-spectra of @xmath4 and @xmath25 cross around @xmath28 gev , such that there are more protons than @xmath4 at large momenta .",
    "we wish to stress that the same phenomenon can be seen already at sps , where the protons dominate @xmath4 at @xmath29 gev .",
    "the lower value of the crossing point reflects a much higher proton density at sps compared to rhic .    at rhic ,",
    "the `` anomalous '' @xcite feature of the spectra is the dominance of @xmath19 over @xmath17 at @xmath30 gev .",
    "one could speculate that a similar behavior might occur already at sps , if the measurements had beed carried out to sufficiently high momenta .",
    "indeed , when the na44 data are extrapolated with simple exponential functions , then one finds that a crossing occurs around @xmath31 gev .",
    "since the exponential fits may not work over the large range in @xmath0 , this phenomenon remains a speculation till verified experimentally .    in order to see the similarities between the data",
    "even more vividly , we scale the normalization of the spectra in the following way :    1 .   in the na49 data we undo the corrections for the feeding of protons and antiprotons from weak decays .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , this correction is about 30% , thus we divide the na49 data for @xmath25 and @xmath19 by the factor 0.7 . 2 .",
    "the most central data from na44 correspond to the average impact parameter @xmath32 = 5 fm , whereas the most central na49 data correspond to @xmath32 = 2 fm @xcite .",
    "this difference explains a smaller normalization of the na44 data .",
    "we correct for the centrality choice of na44 , multiplying all na44 spectra by an educated - guess factor of 1.5 .",
    "3 .   inspired by the success of the thermal approach ,",
    "we scale the spectra by the factor @xmath33 $ ] , where @xmath34 is the freeze - out temperature , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the baryon number , strangeness , and the third component of the isospin of the particle , respectively , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are the corresponding chemical potentials . at sps ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 gev )",
    "@xcite @xmath41 while at rhic ( @xmath42 , @xmath9 gev ) @xcite @xmath43 since in the thermal model the ( original ) spectra are proportional to the factor @xmath44 $ ] ( for the boltzmann statistics , which works very well ) , our rescaling approximately removes the effects of different chemical potentials at rhic and sps .",
    "due to resonance decays , even within the thermal model the scaling is not exact , but approximate . , hence the secondary pions are sensitive to the baryon chemical potential . ]     for various fits of the rescaled mid - rapidity to the exponential form @xmath45 .",
    "optimum values are denoted by crosses .",
    "the numbers in parentheses are the values of the @xmath46 per degree of freedom at the optimum . the data for na49 and the star data for @xmath17 and @xmath18 are preliminary .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=476 ] [ chi2 ]    the described rescaling is not necessary for our analysis , and has no impact on the conclusions .",
    "however , it is useful , since it brings the spectra closer and makes the eye - ball comparison easier .",
    "the results are shown in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "for the pions , the four measurements agree very well in the overlap region .",
    "for the kaons , the na49 data have a visibly larger slope , while the three other sets of data overlap .",
    "the measurements for protons and @xmath19 agree as well .",
    "the spectra of @xmath26 and @xmath20 have smaller slopes in the star measurement compared to na49 .",
    "one should bare in mind that the statistical errors are typically of the order of a few percent , and the systematic errors are around 10% .",
    "hence , within the experimental errors , there are no significant differences between sps and rhic which could indicate different physics . moreover , the small difference between na44 and na49 , and between phenix and star , which one may observe in figs .",
    "3 and 4 is of the same magnitude as the difference between sps and rhic .",
    "in this section we wish to quantify the eye - ball observations from figs .  3 and 4 . the most popular method is to fit the spectra to the exponential function , and compare the parameters .",
    "in fact , this is the most economic and common way of presenting the data , and the differences in the slope parameters of particles of different masses are interpreted as the signature of the transverse flow @xcite .",

    "we use the available data ranges with @xmath48 gev . because of the lack of strict thermodynamic interpretation , we refrain from calling @xmath49 the temperature of the spectrum . ]",
    "the method is as follows : we constrain the fit to @xmath48gev ( this has relevance for the phenix data , and for @xmath26 and @xmath20 measured by star ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume a 15% error on every point .",
    "this is in the ballpark of the errors given by the experimental groups .",

    "the physically relevant parameter is the inverse slope , @xmath49 , while the norm parameter , @xmath50 , carries the ambiguities described above ( rescaling ) .",
    "hence , if the results of the two data sets are to be consistent , then the ranges of @xmath49 ( and not necessarily @xmath50 ) should overlap .",
    "we note from fig .",
    "5 that this is basically the case for na44 and na49 , except perhaps the case of @xmath4 .",

    ", the phenix data agree within errors with na44 and na49 .",
    "some caution is needed in the interpretation of fig .  5 ,",
    "since the fits are made over different ranges in @xmath0 , and the form used for the fit has no sound physical ground .",
    "yet , there are indications for discrepancies between star and phenix . also , it is clear that only the star data suggest larger values of @xmath49 ( albeit with large errors ) , which would mean larger transverse flow .",
    "if phenix data are used , no such conclusion comes out , since the phenix data are basically consistent with sps .",
    "note also that the quality of the fit , indicated by the value of @xmath46 at the optimum , is worst for the case of pions from phenix .",

    "the estimates of the transverse flow must be based on model calculations which include this effect , as well as other potentially important physical effects . in this section",

    "the phenix data are compatible with the same transverse flow as in sps .",

    "3 .   at the moment",
    "the experimental discrepancies between na44 and na49 , and between star and phenix are of the same magnitude as the discrepancies between sps and rhic . with better data",
    "more accurate conclusion would be achieved .",
    "in particular , the rhic measurements at lower energies will be very useful in verifying theoretical hypotheses .",
    "the use of models failing to reproduce the rhic data should be , if possible , avoided in the modeling of detectors and in the analysis of the data .",
    "also , the frequently made corrections for weak decays are not very useful , since these can be accounted for without difficulty in theoretical models . when comparing the corrected data much care is needed as to how the feeding from weak decays has been subtracted .",
    "we recall that the freeze - out temperatures used in the framework of thermal models have saturated ( compare eqs .",
    "( [ spspar ] ) and ( [ rhicpar ] ) ) , which was not yet the case at ags energies . note , however , that the thermal approach works well for the ags data @xcite and for elementary collisions @xcite . 5 .   the transverse hbt radii and the slopes of the spectra are similar at sps and rhic , which implies similar transverse flow , or , in general , similar soft transverse physics .",
    "the particle yields increased by 50% from sps to rhic naturally allow for a 20% increase of the transverse size and flow .",
    "we also recall that the magnitude of the elliptic flow coefficient , @xmath65 , is similar from sps to rhic @xcite . 6 .",
    "the similarity of the soft physics at rhic and sps may be explained by the parton saturation phenomenon @xcite ( scenario ( 2 ) of ref .",
    "if the onset of saturation occurs already at sps energies , then the initial conditions for the multiparticle production are similar at sps and rhic , explaining the similarities discussed in this paper .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of the hagedorn saturation @xcite in elementary collisions , where the further increase of the collision energy does not lead to increased temperature .",
