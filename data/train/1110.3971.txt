    "<S> we show that a baryon asymmetry can be generated by dissipative effects during warm inflation via a supersymmetric two - stage mechanism , where the inflaton is coupled to heavy mediator fields that then decay into light species through @xmath0- and @xmath1-violating interactions . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with thermal gut baryogenesis models , the temperature during inflation is always below the heavy mass threshold , simultaneously suppressing thermal and quantum corrections to the inflaton potential and the production of dangerous gut relics . </S>",
    "<S> this naturally gives a small baryon asymmetry close to the observed value , although parametrically larger values may be diluted after inflation along with any gravitino overabundance . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this process yields baryon isocurvature perturbations within the range of future experiments , making this an attractive and testable model of gut baryogenesis .    </S>",
    "<S> baryogenesis , dissipation , warm inflation , grand unified theories    the inflationary paradigm @xcite has been extremely successful in explaining the flatness and homogeneity of the observable universe , as well as providing an origin for cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and the large scale structure ( lss ) . while models with a single slow - rolling scalar field have been extensively explored in the literature , these haven proven hard to embed within uv - completions of the standard model ( sm ) such as supergravity / string theory constructions , which typically suffer from the so - called ` eta - problem ' that precludes sufficiently long periods of inflation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> warm inflation @xcite ( see also @xcite ) offers an attractive solution to this problem by taking into account dissipative effects , which not only damp the inflaton s motion and allow for longer periods of slow - roll but also act as a source of light particles that may lead to a ` graceful exit ' into a radiation - dominated era . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , when the temperature of the radiation exceeds the hubble rate during inflation , @xmath2 , thermal inflaton fluctuations become the main source of density perturbations , typically yielding lower inflationary scales than _ cold _ scenarios .    from a supersymmetric ( susy ) </S>",
    "<S> two - stage mechanism @xcite , in which interactions between the inflaton and the light particles are mediated by heavy ` catalyzer ' fields @xmath3 , whose masses are _ above _ the temperature of the radiation bath , @xmath4 , the flatness of the inflaton potential is safe from both quantum and thermal corrections . as supersymmetry is , however , inefficient in cancelling time non - local processes , this allows for strong dissipative effects with moderately large field multiplicities @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> dissipation is naturally an out - of - equilibrium process , as annihilation of the resulting particles can not efficiently ` re - populate ' the classical background condensate . </S>",
    "<S> it is then natural to ask whether a baryon asymmetry may be produced during inflation through dissipative effects , by incorporating @xmath0- and @xmath1-violating interactions in the two - stage mechanism described above , thus satisfying the sakharov conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the two - stage interactions then suggests a parallel with thermal baryogenesis models in gut scenarios , in which the @xmath0- and @xmath1-violating decays of heavy gut bosons may occur in an out - of - equilibrium fashion once the temperature of the universe drops below their mass threshold  @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we show that heavy gut states can _ mediate _ dissipative processes during warm inflation leading to a baryon asymmetry ( see e.g. @xcite for related studies ) . </S>",
    "<S> an attractive feature of this mechanism is the generation of an asymmetry at @xmath5 , avoiding the production of undesirable relics , like magnetic monopoles , that are generic in thermal scenarios . as we show below </S>",
    "<S> , the resulting asymmetry is naturally small in the low - temperature regime , despite the @xmath6 couplings typically required for successful warm inflation , as opposed to both thermal and non - thermal @xcite gut baryogenesis scenarios where these are necessarily suppressed .    </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the resulting baryon - to - entropy ratio exhibits thermal fluctuations that lead to baryon isocurvature perturbations in the cmb spectrum and that may be accessible with upcoming experiments such as planck @xcite , a feature which is lacking in many of the proposed models of baryogenesis . _ </S>",
    "<S> warm baryogenesis _ thus constitutes the first example of a consistent warm inflation scenario where a baryon asymmetry is produced and a viable model of gut baryogenesis .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by considering a gut - like extension of the susy two - stage mechanism of @xcite that includes interactions between the inflaton , described by the scalar component @xmath7 of a superfield @xmath8 , and a set of mediator superfields @xmath9 , @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> these are coupled to light degrees of freedom ( dof ) described by a set of @xmath11 superfields @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where the former carry a non - zero baryon number ( or @xmath14 charge ) @xmath15 and the latter correspond to non - baryonic species . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we will loosely refer to these as ` quark ' and ` lepton ' superfields , although our discussion applies to more generic scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant superpotential can be written as : @xmath16~,\\ ] ] where a sum over the heavy and light field indices is implicit . </S>",
    "<S> as generic in susy gut models , the form of the yukawa terms in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ superpotential ] ) is such that there is no consistent assignment of baryon number to any of the @xmath9 fields , which may then decay in a @xmath0-violating fashion . </S>",
    "<S> the couplings @xmath17 and @xmath18 are complex and @xmath19 in order to ensure violation of @xmath20 and @xmath1 , whereas the @xmath21 couplings are real . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the mediator supermultiplet components during inflation is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , with a negligible splitting between the fermionic and bosonic components due to soft susy breaking during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we will also assume the masses of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 components are well below the temperature during warm inflation and may thus be discarded .    </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the main processes contributing to dissipative effects in warm inflation correspond to interactions between the scalar components in a superpotential of the form eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ superpotential ] ) , so that the dominant source of a baryon asymmetry will be the production of squark fields . </S>",

    "<S> a baryon asymmetry will then arise from the difference between the particle production rates for scalar quarks and antiquarks . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> these were computed in the adiabatic regime from the thermal wightman self - energy for each light particle species @xmath29 , yielding for the time derivative of the energy density , @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the momentum and energy of the light fields . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between this quantity for baryonic and anti - baryonic species then sets the rate at which a net baryon asymmetry is produced , and can be compard to the total particle production rate in order to determine the baryon - to - entropy ratio produced by warm inflation . here </S>",
    "<S> we will outline the main steps of this computation , describing the more technical details in the appendix for the interested reader .    </S>",
    "<S> firstly , one should note that in the low - temperature regime , where thermal corrections to the inflaton potential are suppressed , the main contribution to dissipative particle production comes from one - loop effects involving _ virtual _ heavy @xmath25 bosons , since production of on - shell states is boltzmann suppressed for @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this is inherently different from most baryogenesis models in the literature involving the decay of on - shell heavy states , where the out - of - equilibrium condition results from the inbalance between direct decay and inverse decay processes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the leading particle production process is in this case @xcite @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , via virtual @xmath36 field pairs . since the inflaton field is varying ( slowly ) </S>",
    "<S> , the resulting particles can not efficiently annihilate and fully give away their energy back into the background condensate . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a net particle production and makes dissipative effects inherently out - of - equilibrium , as signaled by the non - zero value of the right - hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ndot ] ) for @xmath37 ( see appendix ) .    </S>",
    "<S> although the leading contributions to the light particle self - energy arise at one - loop order , the associated diagrams correspond to ` squared ' tree - level diagrams , and hence can not contribute to the baryon asymmetry according to the theorem by nanopoulos and weinberg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the diagrams contributing to the squark self - energy up to 2-loop order are then illustrated in fig .  1 , with analogous diagrams for the anti - squark self - energy including the complex conjugate couplings .     </S>",
    "<S> self - energy up to 2-loop order . </S>",
    "<S> the filled circles correspond to couplings @xmath38 with the inflaton background field . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we have computed these contributions in the low - temperature regime , @xmath39 , justifying a low - momentum approximation for the heavy boson propagators  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath25 propagators are ` dressed ' , i.e.  involve a resummation over light field loop corrections . </S>",
    "<S> these correspond to the non - vanishing decay width of the heavy bosons , @xmath40 , which induces particle production despite their virtual nature in the low - temperature regime ( see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then obtain for the difference between the squark and anti - squark self - energies : @xmath41\\big)~,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 denotes the momentum of the @xmath25 propagators in the main loop , @xmath43 includes the main loop factors and is explicitly given in the appendix , while @xmath44 is the imaginary part of the ` triangle ' loop integrals . in the low - temperature regime for the heavy particles , a low - momentum approximation applies and we obtain @xmath45 from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ self_energy_diff ] ) and ( [ triangle_loop ] ) , it is easy to conclude that , as in thermal gut baryogenesis models @xcite , one needs at least two distinct heavy fields , with either different masses or different yukawa couplings , in order to produce a non - vanishing baryon asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , note that the trace @xmath46 $ ] is real for @xmath47 and that the @xmath48 and @xmath49 contributions cancel each other unless @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> .    the total particle production rate can be computed by adding the self - energy of all the light baryonic and non - baryonic fields , for which it is sufficient to consider the lowest - order diagrams in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives : @xmath51 + \\mathrm{tr}[\\bm{\\lambda}_a^*\\bm{\\lambda}_a^t]+ \\mathrm{tr}[\\bm{\\lambda}_a\\bm{\\lambda}_a^\\dagger]\\bigg]~,\\ ] ] where the first two terms correspond to the self - energy of the light baryonic species and the last term to the non - baryonic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the internal and external momentum integrations , as well as the time integration in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ndot ] ) , can then be performed following the procedure in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum dependence of the triangle loop integrals @xmath48 yields an additional factor @xmath52 with respect to the leading order result , while changing the overall value by a factor @xmath53 , which we obtained numerically ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to an inherent momentum cut - off in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ triangle_loop ] ) due to boltzmann suppression of the heavy mediators in the low-@xmath54 regime , such that @xmath55 .    for concreteness , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a case with @xmath56 degenerate fields of mass @xmath57 and an additional multiplet of mass @xmath58 , with @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume without loss of generality that all @xmath12 superfields carry the same baryonic charge , @xmath60 , and that the yukawa couplings only differ by a phase , i.e.  @xmath61 and @xmath62 , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 denoting unitary matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we find the asymmetry ratio to be @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes an effective cp - violating phase . </S>",
    "<S> note that this is independent of the number of light species @xmath11 and only mildly dependent on @xmath67 .    during inflation , the radiation density is determined by both the dissipative effects and the hubble friction , with evolution equation @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the dissipative coefficient , computed in the low-@xmath54 regime  @xcite , is of the form @xmath69 , where @xmath70 for @xmath71 , with @xmath72 denoting the number of available decay channels for the heavy mediators . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , a fraction @xmath73 sources a net baryon number density @xmath74 . since @xmath75 , with @xmath76 denoting the number of relativistic dof , the entropy and baryon number densities are given by : @xmath77 with @xmath78 giving the number of baryonic dof . note </S>",
    "<S> that this includes fermionic fields , which are thermally produced despite the dominant scalar nature of the dissipative processes  @xcite . in the slow - roll regime , these quantities quickly approach a steady state solution , yielding for the baryon - to - entropy ratio @xmath79 , @xmath80 in warm inflation models , radiation typically comes to dominate the energy density @xcite , ending inflation during the slow - roll regime , such that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ baryon_asymmetry ] ) gives the observed value if no significant entropy production or washout processes occur in the post - inflationary evolution . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , one can ensure that electroweak sphaleron processes @xcite conserve the produced asymmetry by generating a net @xmath14 number density during warm inflation . </S>",
    "<S> also , if the ` catalyzer ' fields are heavy ( majorana ) right - handed neutrinos with @xmath81-violating interactions @xcite , an inflationary lepton asymmetry may later be converted into baryon number by sphaleron processes .    </S>",
    "<S> apart from numerical factors , the main difference between the baryon asymmetry produced by dissipation and the corresponding result for out - of - equilibrium decay of heavy bosons resides in the @xmath82 suppression in the low-@xmath54 regime , so that the heavy fields are not excited by background dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> this is an appealing feature , since it not only prevents the generation of gut relics that could overclose the universe but also leads to a small baryon - to - entropy ratio , at the same time ensuring that thermal corrections are under control . </S>",
    "<S> taking for instance @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and the mssm values for @xmath78 and @xmath76 , we then obtain @xmath86 note that the moderately large field multiplicity typically required in warm inflation models will not affect the ratio @xmath87 significantly . </S>",
    "<S> the best present estimate for the baryonic asymmetry comes from big - bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite , @xmath88 , at 95@xmath89 c.l . </S>",
    "<S> our result ( [ baryon_asymmetry_estimate ] ) may thus be naturally within the observed window despite the @xmath6 couplings typically required in warm inflation scenarios , with mass degeneracy and a cp - violating phase at only the few percent level . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , thermal gut baryogenesis scenarios require strongly suppressed couplings in order to reproduce the observed asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , in non - thermal scenarios @xcite , the parametric resonance that excites the heavy bosons is efficient only for sufficiently long lifetimes .    in some warm inflationary scenarios , </S>",
    "<S> radiation is always subdominant even though dissipation sustains the required number of e - folds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one then expects additional entropy production through conventional reheating processes , as well as possibly from the late decay of any light moduli present during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> notice , however , that moduli dynamics may be modified due to the thermal radiation bath with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> although this may dilute any undesired gravitino abundance @xcite , it will also dilute the asymmetry produced by dissipation , but this may be compensated with larger @xmath1 phases , couplings and non - degeneracies in the heavy mediator spectrum .    given that @xmath90 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ baryon_asymmetry ] ) also implies @xmath91 , so that thermal fluctuations of the inflaton field will be imprinted on the baryon - to - entropy ratio . </S>",
    "<S> although baryons are subdominant during inflation , they become a significant component of the energy density at late times and will contribute to cmb anisotropies and lss . </S>",
    "<S> although such baryon isocurvature perturbations ( bip ) also arise in other scenarios @xcite , they are in this case fully ( anti-)correlated with adiabatic perturbations , since both originate from inflaton fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> these can be obtained by perturbing the inflaton equation , @xmath92 , and are coupled to the temperature fluctuations via the evolution equation for @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> bip are conventionally measured by the ratio @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the gauge - invariant curvature perturbation and @xmath96 @xcite . in the slow - roll regime , on superhorizon scales , we obtain after some algebra :    @xmath97\\over(1+q)^2(1 + 7q)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we define @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> this thus yields an additional observable that may be used to probe the consistency of warm inflation models , along with the spectral index , the tensor - to - scalar ratio and non - gaussianity parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we obtain @xcite @xmath102 so that @xmath103 is generically at most of the same order of magnitude as the deviations from scale invariance , with @xmath104 ( 68% c.l . ) </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , being further suppressed for strong dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for a quartic potential one finds @xmath105 in the weak and strong dissipation regimes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the most recent wmap analysis of cold dark matter anti - correlated isocurvature perturbations @xcite , taking into account that @xmath106 , yields @xmath107 ( 95% c.l . ) , for @xmath108 , while according to an earlier analysis @xmath109 ( 95% c.l . ) </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is thus generically consistent with the expected amount of bip , even for @xmath110 , while planck should improve these bounds by an order of magnitude  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> generating a baryon asymmetry through dissipative effects during warm inflation thus exhibits several attractive features . by keeping the temperature during inflation below the gut scale , it provides an appealing model of gut baryogenesis , with no unwanted relics and a small baryon - to - entropy ratio with no unnaturally suppressed couplings and cp - violating angles , at the same time keeping thermal corrections to the inflaton potential under control . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a superpotential of the form in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ superpotential ] ) is natural in susy gut constructions where the inflaton lies within a diagonal subgroup of an adjoint higgs representation and the heavy mediators correspond to its off - diagonal components , as in the d - brane model considered in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these constructions are also natural arenas for warm inflation due to the large field multiplicity available , ensuring sufficiently strong friction effects to sustain the required number of e - folds .    </S>",
    "<S> although in this work we have focused on the baryon asymmetry generated by the varying inflaton field , it is possible in some models of warm inflation for excitations above the background condensate , @xmath111 , to also play a significant role . </S>",
    "<S> the slow roll conditions require @xmath112 , where @xmath98 , which imply @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath2 during warm inflation , one could have @xmath114 if @xmath110 in the early stages of inflation , such that the process @xmath115 contributes to @xmath116 and hence the @xmath117 particle states become a non - negligible component of the radiation bath . </S>",
    "<S> they are , however , unstable and decay via @xmath118 through virtual @xmath36 fields . if dissipation becomes strong towards the end of inflation , @xmath119 , as is the case for typical inflationary potentials @xcite , it is possible to have @xmath120 , depending on the evolution of @xmath121 and @xmath54 , so that the @xmath117 states decay out - of - equilibrium and produce a net baryon number . given the common origin and structure of the relevant interactions , the contributions from background dissipation and @xmath117 decay to the baryon asymmetry will necessarily have the same sign and similar magnitude , so that our earlier results are robust despite the dependency of the latter contribution on the details of the inflationary dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the crucial aspects of the model presented in this letter is the fact that dissipation provides a novel mechanism for satisfying the sakharov out - of - equilibrium condition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although we have examined a nearly thermal equilibrium regime , warm inflation is general to any non - equilibrium inflationary scenario governed by fluctuation - dissipation dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , dissipative processes may also play an important role in the post- inflationary universe , e.g.  during cosmological phase transitions , so that we may extrapolate from our analysis a more general mechanism of _ dissipative baryogenesis_.    warm baryogenesis thus provides an unprecedented link between inflationary physics and the observed baryon asymmetry , a connection that may be tested in the near future and possibly shed a new light on two of the most important problems in modern cosmology . </S>"
