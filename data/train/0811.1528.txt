    "it has been shown by haldane that , depending on the value of the spin @xmath4 , the corresponding one dimensional antiferromagnetic chains of quantum spins present two kinds of large distance behavior .",
    "if @xmath4 is half  integer , they have a power law correlation function . instead for integer spins they lie in a disordered phase and present an exponentially falling correlation function  @xcite .",
    "these results were obtained in the limit of large @xmath4 .",
    "the generalization of the above behavior for all values ( large or small ) of the spin @xmath4 is called haldane conjecture .",
    "this conjecture has been widely studied .",
    "actually a partial result had already been proved for @xmath5 in  @xcite , while for all half ",
    "integer spins it was shown to be correct in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the analytic proof for spin @xmath6 was given in  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand there are indications  @xcite that the one dimensional antiferromagnetic chain of quantum spins @xmath4 shares the same large distance physical properties of the two dimensional o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model for classical spins with a @xmath0 term for @xmath7 .",
    "this equivalence would imply that while the ground state of the two dimensional o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model at vanishing @xmath0 must display no long  range order and only short ",
    "range spin correlations , the model at @xmath8 should be critical .",
    "the first result is well  known , both analytically  @xcite and numerically  @xcite . however",
    "the large distance behavior of the correlation function of the model in the second case is a not so clearly settled question .",
    "the two dimensional o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model is a valuable representation of several types of physical problems .",
    "apart from the one dimensional quantum spin chains , in condensed matter physics it may describe the quantum hall effect as well as being useful to understand superconductivity  @xcite . in particle physics",
    "it has in common with nonabelian gauge theories some important properties such as instantons , asymptotic freedom ( criticality at zero temperature ) , a @xmath0 term , spontaneous generation of mass , etc .",
    "two recent numerical calculations of the partition function for the o(3 ) model in the presence of a @xmath0 term  @xcite suggest that the theory undergoes a second order phase transition at @xmath8 although the two analyses disagree about the universality class .",

    "we introduce a direct numerical method to verify the haldane conjecture for the two dimensional o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model at nonzero @xmath0 .",
    "the idea is to perform a monte carlo simulation to calculate the correlation length @xmath1 on the lattice as a function of the @xmath0 parameter and to show that it diverges at a precise value of @xmath0 , called @xmath10 , which , following haldane , should be @xmath11 .    due to the ( suppossed ) divergence of the correlation length at @xmath10 ,",
    "a direct simulation would become impracticable as it would require exponentially large lattice sizes .",
    "moreover the boltzmann weight in the partition function becomes complex for real @xmath0 and consequently it loses its probability meaning , thus precluding the importance sampling of monte carlo methods .",
    "we overcome these two difficulties by simulating the theory at imaginary @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 turns out to be small enough to allow the use of moderate lattice sizes ) and analytically continuing the results to the real @xmath0 values . to this end",
    "we introduce a new fast cluster algorithm that works for imaginary nonzero theta .",
    "this work is an extended version of the paper appeared in  @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we shall discuss the formulation of the model on the lattice and the corresponding lattice definition of the @xmath0 term and its meaning .",
    "the method to calculate the @xmath0 term is introduced in section  [ thetacalc ] .",
    "the new cluster algorithm expressly devised for the present work shall be described in section  [ cluster ] .",
    "the results and corresponding plots are displayed in section  [ results ] .",
    "we end the paper with some conclusive comments in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the boltzmann weight of the partition function in our simulations was @xmath12 with @xmath13 where the sum is extended over all lattice sites @xmath14 and directions @xmath15 .",
    "the factor @xmath16 is the inverse temperature ( in units of the spin coupling ) , @xmath17 is the total topological charge or winding number of the configuration ( see later ) and @xmath18 is a 3component unit vector that represents the dynamical variable , a classical spin , at the site @xmath14 . we have used a square lattice of lateral size @xmath19 with periodic boundary conditions .    in the limit where the lattice spacing @xmath20 vanishes ( keeping @xmath21 fixed ) , the above expression for @xmath22 becomes the action of the classical field theory defined on a continuum two dimensional plane @xmath23 together with the condition @xmath24 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] we show a stereographic projection that defines an instanton configuration on the o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model .",
    "the two dimensional plane is shown where the configuration of spins lies .",
    "there is a unit sphere resting on the origin of the plane .",
    "one can draw straight lines that join the north pole @xmath25 of the sphere with an arbitrary point @xmath26 on the plane .",
    "one such a line pierces the sphere surface at point @xmath27 .",
    "the unit vector that begins at the center @xmath28 of the sphere and points to @xmath27 is the value of the spin vector @xmath29 to be assigned at the point @xmath26 of the plane .",
    "this construction defines a configuration called instanton and its analytical expression is the following ( the lattice has been replaced by a continuum by sending @xmath30 as above , furthermore polar coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath32 are used to locate the position of the spin variable ) @xmath33 in particular , notice that all spins at infinity are identified with the same value @xmath34 . then spins slowly",
    "rotate while approaching @xmath35 until becoming @xmath36 at the origin .    the spin value in eq.([instphi ] )",
    "is a solution of the classical field equations associated to the action eq.([acontinuum ] ) .",
    "the main feature of instanton configurations is that the set of all spin vectors describes a complete winding of the sphere , as it is obvious in the example shown above .",
    "this winding can be calculated by the integral  @xcite ( valid in the continuum two dimensional plane ) @xmath37 where @xmath17 is called topological charge or winding number and @xmath38 is the topological charge density .",
    "spatial indices @xmath39 and o(3 ) vector indices @xmath40 are summed up . for the instanton of eq.([instphi ] ) it yields @xmath41 .",
    "there are however many more instantonic configurations , besides that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] and in general @xmath17 takes any positive , negative or null integer value , depending on how many times and in what direction the whole set of spins covers the unit sphere .",
    "the second main property is that instanton configurations carry a finite amount of energy ( the operator @xmath22 in eq.([acontinuum ] ) takes on a finite value ) even when the lattice size @xmath19 diverges .    in the monte carlo simulations",
    "we have used two different definitions of @xmath38 .",
    "the first one  @xcite @xmath42 is a symmetrical discretization of the expression for @xmath38 in eq.([continuumaction ] ) and is usually called `` naive '' definition .",
    "the corresponding winding number is @xmath43 .",
    "the second lattice expression that we used in our simulations is defined on triangles ( not on single sites ) .",
    "every plaquette of a square lattice can be cut through a diagonal into two triangles .",
    "if we call @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 the fields at the sites of the three vertices ( numbered counterclockwise ) of one of these triangles , then the fraction of spherical angle subtended by these fields is @xmath47 and it satisfies  @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "the above conditions uniquely determine the portion of spherical angle subtended by @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 and the sum of @xmath47 over all triangles yields the so  called `` geometrical '' topological charge  @xmath51 .    the two definitions @xmath52 belong to the same universality class .",
    "in particular they both satisfy the limit @xmath53 where @xmath20 is the lattice spacing .",
    "in general , a definition of @xmath17 on the lattice does not necessarily lead to integer values on a single configuration . to recover integer results for @xmath17 on ensembles of configurations that contain the same topological charge , we must renormalize this operator .",
    "the lattice and the continuum topological charges are related by  @xcite @xmath54 @xmath55 being the corresponding renormalization constant .",
    "the origin of this constant can be traced back to the presence of statistical fluctuations in an otherwise smooth instantonic configuration . in general operators that reveal the topological charge @xmath17 of a configuration",
    "give wrong answers due to the disturbance caused by the presence of fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath55 function depends only on the temperature @xmath16 and is chosen in such a way not to depend on @xmath0 since the introduction of this term does not modify the structure of fluctuations in the model .",
    "moreover it satisfies @xmath56 for all values of the lattice spacing  @xcite .",
    "@xmath55 can be calculated either in perturbation theory  @xcite or by a nonperturbative numerical method  @xcite .",
    "we have used the latter . in a nutshell",
    "it works in the following way : one measures @xmath52 on an instantonic configuration ( topological charge @xmath57 ) after heating it at a temperature @xmath16 . from eq.([qlzq ] ) this measurement yields @xmath55 .",
    "first of all an instanton with topological charge + 1 is put by hand on the lattice .",
    "we used the solution  @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the @xmath60component of the field at site @xmath61 , @xmath19 is the size of the lattice and @xmath62 is the size of the instanton .",
    "this solution is the one shown in eq.([instphi ] ) after centering it in the middle of the lattice @xmath63 , dilating it to the size @xmath62 ( the size in eq.([instphi ] ) is @xmath64 ) and performing appropriate rotations both in @xmath14space and o(3 ) space  @xcite . in order to work with a rather stable instanton ( recall that single instantons on the lattice are only metastable solutions of the equations of motion on a torus ) it is convenient to choose @xmath65 and @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "we took @xmath67 on a @xmath68 lattice .",
    "then 100 updating steps are applied ( we used the heat  bath algorithm  @xcite on the conventional o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model without a @xmath0 term since the renormalization constant to be used in eq.([qlzq ] ) does not depend on @xmath0 ) . after every heat ",
    "bath step the value of @xmath52 is measured and , in order to monitor the instantonic contents and check that it is not varied after the updating step , @xmath52 is measured again after 6  relaxation hits applied on a separate copy of the running configuration .",
    "the complete history of 100 heat ",
    "bath updating steps and related measurements of @xmath52 is called a _",
    "trajectory_. in the calculation of @xmath69 we used @xmath70 trajectories at @xmath71 and @xmath72 and @xmath73 trajectories for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the average of @xmath52 on all trajectories , as long as their topological charge remained equal to @xmath76 , yielded @xmath55 .",
    "the o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model develops an infrared divergence in its instanton size distribution  @xcite .",
    "this divergence facilitates the copious creation of new instantonic objects at every updating step , thus modifying the total topological charge of the configuration . for this reason the relaxation test is extremely important .    as a relaxation method we used the so",
    " called cooling  @xcite",
    ". it sweeps through the whole lattice and modifies one by one every single spin variable in order to locally minimize the energy of the relaxed configuration .",
    "actually many variants of the cooling method exist in the literature but in practice all of them act analogously  @xcite .",
    "the above nonperturbative method is summarized by the expression @xmath77 where @xmath78 stands for the measure @xmath79 and @xmath80 means that the integration is extended over all configurations ( fluctuations ) that preserve the background of one instanton . since the geometrical charge @xmath51 is + 1 till the background configuration is one instanton , the expression  ( [ heatingmethod ] ) yields @xmath81 for all @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "this result derives from the fact that fluctuations , viewed as local large ( positive or negative ) values of the spherical angle in some spherical triangles , cancel out when summing up all individual contributions @xmath47 .",
    "the determination of @xmath69 is not so trivial and an example of such an evaluation is shown in fig .",
    "measures of @xmath82 on configurations that have topological charge @xmath76 attain to a plateau ( in general after a few heat  bath steps ) and stay on it for the rest of the updating steps .",
    "the height of this plateau is the value of @xmath69 . in table  1",
    "the results for @xmath69 at the values of @xmath16 used in the present work are given .",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath10 for the topological charge @xmath82 .    in fig .",
    "[ fighisto ] an histogram of the distribution of topological charge @xmath82 is shown .",
    "it has been produced from the data of @xmath82 obtained during the calculation of @xmath69 at @xmath71 and contains 70 bins within the interval @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "for each trajectory in the calculation of @xmath69 we obtained the average of @xmath82 over the steps that come after the onset of the plateau ( from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] this happens at about the 15th step for @xmath71 ) and for which the cooling test gave a background topological charge @xmath76 .",
    "the histogram of fig .",
    "[ fighisto ] displays the distribution of these averages .",
    "each of the above averages turns out to be an uncorrelated estimate of @xmath69 .",
    "the thick vertical line is the value of @xmath69 , 0.285(9 ) .",
    "actually the error in the evaluation of @xmath69 was determined by using this kind of plot .",
    "indeed , it was extracted by usual gaussian analysis on the histogram .",
    "recall that the number of trajectories for @xmath71 was 40000",
    ". however the area of the histogram in fig .",
    "[ fighisto ] is much less than 40000 .",
    "this is due to the fact that in many trajectories the background charge is no longer @xmath76 already at the beginning of the plateau . in such cases ,",
    "the whole trajectory was discarded .",
    "the area under the histogram in fig .",
    "[ fighisto ] is about 6700 .",
    "the small ratio 6700/40000 gives an idea of the frequent creation of new instantonic objects that modify the background topological charge .",
    "the renormalization of the topological charge brings about a relevant consequence for our study : the @xmath0 parameter that appears in the expression of the hamiltonian used in the computer program during the simulations in general is _ not _ equal to the true physical @xmath0 parameter .",
    "henceforth we shall call @xmath84 the parameter that appears in the simulation program and the relation among the two parameters is @xmath85 .",
    "the value of @xmath84 where the correlation length diverges will be called @xmath86 . since @xmath81 , it is clear that this distinction among theta parameters is irrelevant for the geometrical charge @xmath51 .",
    "we have simulated the model at several temperatures @xmath16 and parameters @xmath84 for the two topological charge operators @xmath82 and @xmath51 in order to show that our results are independent of the operator chosen for the simulation .",
    "moreover , for the case of the naive topological charge @xmath82 , we have introduced a very fast cluster algorithm . instead , for the geometrical charge @xmath51 a rather slow metropolis  like",
    "algorithm has been used .",
    "actually the cluster algorithm for the naive charge was so efficient that it took much less computer time to investigate this charge than the geometrical one even though the naive charge required the extra calculation of @xmath69 by a separate out  of  equilibrium simulation for each temperature @xmath16 as described above .",
    "although the use of the topological charge density @xmath82 requires the knowledge of a renormalization constant , it brings about the advantage that the hamiltonian in  ( [ latticeaction ] ) can be simulated on the lattice by use of a fast cluster algorithm when @xmath84 is imaginary .",
    "let us briefly describe the main characteristics of the new cluster algorithm expressly devised for the present work .",
    "the first part of an updating step with the usual wolff algorithm  @xcite for the standard o(3 ) sigma model without a @xmath0 term consists in choosing a random unit vector @xmath87 in such a way that every dynamical field can be split in a component parallel to @xmath87 and the rest , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 denotes the part of @xmath18 orthogonal to @xmath87 .",
    "then the signs of @xmath90 for all @xmath14 are updated  la swendsen  wang as in the ising model  @xcite .    by introducing the above separation for @xmath18 in the expression  ( [ latticeq1 ] ) and recalling elementary properties of determinants in three dimensional vector spaces ,",
    "we can rewrite it as @xmath91 where @xmath92 means the site at the position one step forward ( backward ) in the direction `` 1 '' starting from site @xmath14 and the notation @xmath93 stands for the @xmath94 determinant @xmath95 in this fashion the theory at each updating step looks like an ising model in the bosom of an external local magnetic field @xmath96 because the expression in eq.([latticeq1bis ] ) is linear in @xmath97 .",
    "the value of this field varies at each updating and accordingly it must be recalculated after every step .",
    "recall that all monte carlo simulations have been performed with an imaginary parameter @xmath98 , ( @xmath99 ) . by gathering all contributions of the type shown in eq.([latticeq1bis ] ) that contain @xmath90 at site @xmath14 one can readily derive the effective magnetic field at this site , @xmath100 @xmath101 ( and analogous terms in  ( [ fieldmag ] ) ) are the straightforward generalization of the above definition  ( [ definitiond ] ) when the site is obtained by shifting two steps from the original position  @xmath14 , the first in the direction @xmath102 and the second in the direction @xmath103 .",
    "hence the last step in the updating consists in applying to the above expressions an algorithm valid for the ising model in presence of a magnetic field . in the literature",
    "there are two such algorithms , the lauwers ",
    "rittenberg  @xcite and the wang  @xcite methods .",
    "after testing their perfomances and comparing the corresponding decorrelation times with the usual metropolis  @xcite , heat  bath  @xcite and overheat ",
    "bath  @xcite , we decided on the wang algorithm .",
    "it consists in placing the magnetic field on an extra , fictitious site ( called ghost site or ghost spin ) that couples to every ising spin through the value of @xmath96 . using this coupling on the same footing as all other terms in the action , the fortuin ",
    "kasteleyn clusters  @xcite are created by using the hoshen ",
    "kopelman algorithm  @xcite and then updated with the usual @xmath104 probability",
    ". the only distinctive feature of the presence of a ghost spin is that the cluster that contains it does not flip .",
    "following the proof given in  @xcite , it can be seen that our algorithm also satisfies the detailed balance property .    to generate the initial random unit vector @xmath87 the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite was used .    in fig .",
    "[ figcompar ] we show the autocorrelation functions @xmath105 calculated from the measures of the energy operator @xmath106 ( not summed over @xmath107 ) , for the two algorithms : metropolis when the @xmath51 operator is used and the above  described cluster algorithm for @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath108 indicates the @xmath109th measurement . in both cases @xmath71 and @xmath68 .",
    "the theta parameter was @xmath110 for @xmath82 and @xmath111 for @xmath51 ( note that this choice was dictated by the condition @xmath112 ) .",
    "the plot clearly exhibits the major efficiency of the cluster algorithm .",
    "as the ground state of the model is a triplet  @xcite , we studied the correlation functions of operators having one o(3 ) index .",
    "we measured the correlation of the two operators @xmath113 firstly we calculated the corresponding wall operators by averaging over the @xmath114 coordinate @xmath115 in order to extract the correct correlation length and to clean its signal from any mixture with higher eigenvalues of the transfer matrix , we used the variational method of ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath1 is obtained from the exponential decay of the largest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix @xmath116    no improved estimators  @xcite were used since the operators in  ( [ operators ] ) contain too many fields @xmath117 and this fact leads to intractable sums over clusters  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ figmass ] the method that we followed to extract @xmath1 is illustrated with four examples .",

    "the definite values of @xmath1 and its error were chosen self ",
    "consistently at @xmath122 .    for each @xmath16 we calculated @xmath1 from monte carlo simulations at several imaginary values of @xmath84 for both @xmath82 and @xmath51 .",
    "the set of results for a given @xmath16 were then analytically continued from imaginary @xmath84 to the real @xmath84 axis by an usual procedure of numerical extrapolation . in the extrapolation we avoided using a trial function dictated by some theoretical argument , like for instance @xmath123 which is , up to logarithmic corrections , the renormalization group prediction  @xcite , because such an analytic form implicitly assumes the vanishing of @xmath124 at a precise value of @xmath84 ( not to say that it is supposed to be accurate only in a close neighborhood of its zero , @xmath125 ) .",
    "instead we made the extrapolations by using polynomials in @xmath126 and ratios of such polynomials .",
    "these functional forms are indeed both simple and very general and they leave room for any possible behavior in  @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath127 decorrelated propagators were measured for all values of @xmath84 at each @xmath16 .",

    "[ fig2 ] it seems clear that all analytic continuations are in fair agreement among themselves and with the haldane conjecture . we emphasize that no prejudices about the possible zeroes were included in the extrapolating functions .",
    "four values of @xmath16 were studied in the case of @xmath82 : @xmath71 , 1.6 , 1.7 and 1.75 .",
    "the respective sets of monte carlo data for @xmath124 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as circles , up triangles , squares and down triangles .",
    "the lattice sizes were 120 , 180 , 340 and 470 respectively .",
    "the extrapolations in this figure were done by using the functional form @xmath130 since it was the one that produced the value of the statistical @xmath131 test closer to 1 for all four @xmath16 s ( the values for @xmath132d.o.f .",

    "the results of the analytic continuations are given in table  1 .",
    "the physical value of @xmath0 where the theory becomes critical is given by @xmath133 .",
    "the numbers in the last column are in good agreement with the prediction that criticality is achieved when @xmath0 equals @xmath2 .",
    "other functional forms used for the extrapolations led to similar results although in some cases the @xmath131 test was far from unity and hence the related extrapolation seemed statistically unlikely ( see for instance the @xmath134 case in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the lattice sizes were chosen large enough to meet at @xmath135 the condition @xmath136 ( to be specific , these ratios were 10.8 , 9.5 , 9.8 and 9.9 for @xmath71 , 1.6 , 1.7 and 1.75 respectively ) .",
    "once this inequality holds at @xmath135 , it is amply realized at the values of @xmath84 where the simulations were performed as inferred from fig .",
    "this fact warrants the absence of significant finite size effects .    on the other hand , from the monte carlo values of @xmath1 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] one can see that we simulated the model at correlation lengths that altogether satisfy @xmath137 which is safely far from the strong coupling region ( in this region the universality property loses its meaning and results may depend on the choice of operators used in the action ) .",

    "such modifications occur only if some instantonic object rises or disappears in the area delimited by these six triangles .",
    "such an event barely occurs on a such a small area and as a consequence prolonged decorrelations must separate consecutive measurements of any operator ( see fig .  [ figcompar ] ) .",

    "this value seems very robust as it is independent of the topological charge density operator chosen for the simulation .",

    "first of all at real @xmath0 the hamiltonian becomes complex , thus preventing the importance sampling in monte carlo methods .",

    "a new fast cluster algorithm was purposely introduced to simulate the theory with an imaginary @xmath0 term .",
    "it works for the operator @xmath82 .",
    "a salient outcome of our work is the good performance of the analytic continuation from imaginary to real @xmath0 .",
    "no theoretical prejudices were assumed in the functional form used in the extrapolation and different functions led to comparable results ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .    a key ingredient for the successful extrapolation was to have got data from simulations within a wide range of ( imaginary ) values of @xmath84 for all @xmath16 , ( @xmath145 $ ] when @xmath82 was used and @xmath146 $ ] for @xmath51 , the difference of intervals being due to the effect of the nontrivial renormalization that must be applied to the former ) .",
    "we also noticed that at very large values of imaginary @xmath84 the extraction of the correlation length becomes more imprecise since the kind of plateaux shown in fig .",
    "[ figmass ] shrink making it difficult to decide the correct result for @xmath1 and its error bar .",
    "this problem appears approximately at @xmath147 for the @xmath82 charge density .",
    "then , the method consists in taking data in a wide range of values of imaginary @xmath84 ( or @xmath0 ) while staying not too far from the real axis in order to make the extrapolation sensitive to the real physics of the problem and in order to have wide enough plateaux which allow to easily extract the correlation length @xmath1 .",
    "moreover our extrapolations did not cross any nonanalytical region in the phase diagram of the model .",
    "indeed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show a schematic reproduction of the phase diagram that appears in ref .",
    "the first order transitions lie on the continuous straight line while the dashed line indicates less singular transitions , at most second order .",
    "our simulations were performed at the positions indicated by the symbols ( same symbols than in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] ; notice that this plot refers to the values of @xmath0 , not of @xmath84 , for both topological charge density definitions ) and the corresponding analytic continuations proceed downwards , thus very far from any possible line of singular points .",
    "for @xmath148 the model should acquire again a finite correlation length since the hamiltonian is a periodic function of @xmath0 .",
    "however an analytical continuation could hardly display such a behavior beyond @xmath8 because of the nonanalyticity at that value of @xmath0 .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank juan jos alonso for a critical reading of a draft of the paper .",
    "we are indebted to cineca ( italy ) for the use of their hpc system for part of our production runs .",
