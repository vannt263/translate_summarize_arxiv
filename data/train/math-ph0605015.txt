    "the @xmath5-state potts model on a graph @xmath6 with vertices @xmath7 and edges @xmath8 can be defined geometrically through the cluster expansion of the partition function @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the number of connected components ( clusters ) and the cardinality ( number of links ) of the edge subsets @xmath12 .",
    "we are interested in the case where @xmath13 is a finite regular two - dimensional lattice of width @xmath14 and length @xmath15 , so that @xmath16 can be constructed by a transfer matrix @xmath17 propagating in the @xmath15-direction .    in a companion paper @xcite",
    ", we studied the case of cyclic boundary conditions ( periodic in the @xmath15-direction and non - periodic in the @xmath14-direction ) .",
    "we decomposed @xmath16 into linear combinations of certain restricted partition functions ( characters ) @xmath18 ( with @xmath2 ) in which @xmath19 _ bridges _ ( that is , marked non - contractible clusters ) wound around the periodic lattice direction",
    ". we shall often refer to @xmath19 as the _",
    "level_. unlike @xmath16 itself , the @xmath18 could be written as ( restricted ) traces of the transfer matrix , and hence be directly related to its eigenvalues .",
    "it was thus straightforward to deduce from this decomposition the amplitudes in @xmath16 of the eigenvalues of @xmath17 .",
    "the goal of this second part of our work is to repeat this procedure in the case of toroidal boundary conditions .",
    "this case has been a lot less studied than the cyclic case ( a noticeable exception is @xcite ) . indeed ,",
    "when the boundary conditions are toroidal , the transfer matrix ( of the related six - vertex model , to be precise ) does no longer commute with the generators of the quantum group @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , there is no simple algebraic way of obtaining the amplitudes of eigenvalues , although some progress has been made by considering representations of the periodic temperley - lieb algebra ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "but the representations of this algebra are not all known , and therefore we choose to pursue here another approach than the algebraic one .",
    "we use instead the combinatorial approach we developed in @xcite , as it is for now the only approach which can be easily extended to the toroidal case .",
    "there are however several complications due to the boundary conditions ,",
    "the first of which is that the bridges can now be permuted ( by exploiting the periodic @xmath14-direction ) . in the following",
    "this leads us to consider decomposition of @xmath16 into more elementary quantities than @xmath18 , namely characters @xmath21 labeled by @xmath19 _ and _ a class @xmath22 of permuations of the symmetric group @xmath4 .",
    "however , @xmath21 is not simply linked to the eigenvalues of @xmath23 , and thus we will further consider its expansion over related quantities @xmath1 , where @xmath3 labels an irreducible representation ( irrep ) of @xmath4 .",
    "it is @xmath1 which are the elementary quantities in the case of toroidal boundary conditions .",
    "the second complication comes from the fact that , due to the planarity of the lattice , not all the permutations between bridges can be realised .",
    "it follows that the @xmath1 are not all independent , and so there are eigenvalue degeneracies inside and between levels .",
    "finally , there can be additional degeneracies because of the particular symmetry of the lattice , and even accidental degeneracies , where an eigenvalue at level @xmath24 coincides with an eigenvalue at level @xmath25 @xcite , without any apparent reason . ] .",
    "we have therefore not been able to go as far as in the cyclic case , where the amplitude of any eigenvalue in @xmath18 was given by a simple expression , depending only on @xmath19 .",
    "we do however establish an operational method of determining , for any fixed ( but in practice small ) @xmath14 , the amplitudes and degeneracies of eigenvalues in the case of a generic lattice .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we define appropriate generalisations of the quantities we used in the cyclic case @xcite .",
    "then , in section [ sec3 ] , we decompose restricted partition functions  and as a byproduct the total partition function  into characters @xmath18 and @xmath21",
    ". finally , in section [ sec4 ] , we expose a method of determining the amplitudes of eigenvalues .",
    "as in the cyclic case , the existence of a periodic boundary condition allows for non - trivial clusters ( henceforth abbreviated ntc ) , i.e. , clusters which are not homotopic to a point .",
    "however , the fact that the torus has _ two _ periodic directions means that the topology of the ntc is more complicated that in the cyclic case .",
    "indeed , each ntc belongs to a given homotopy class , which can be characterised by two coprime numbers @xmath27 , where @xmath28 ( resp .",
    "@xmath29 ) denotes the number of times the cluster percolates horizontally ( resp .",
    "vertically ) @xcite .",
    "the fact that all clusters ( non - trivial or not ) are still constrained by planarity to be non - intersecting induces a convenient simplification : all ntc in a given configuration belong to the same homotopy class . for comparison",
    ", we recall that in the cyclic case the only possible homotopy class for a ntc was @xmath30 .",
    "it is a well - known fact @xcite that the difficulty in decomposing the potts model partition function  or relating it to partition functions of locally equivalent models ( of the six - vertex or rsos type)is due solely to the weighing of the ntc .",
    "although a typical cluster configuration will of course contain trivial clusters ( i.e. , clusters that are homotopic to a point ) with seemingly complicated topologies ( e.g. , trivial clusters can surround other trivial clusters , or be surrounded by trivial clusters or by ntc ) , we shall therefore tacitly disregard such clusters in most of the arguments that follow .",
    "note also that the so - called degenerate clusters of ref .",
    "@xcite in the present context correspond to @xmath31 .",
    "non - trivial clusters ( ntc ) , here represented in red and blue colours .",
    "each ntc is characterised by its number of branches , @xmath32 , and by the permutation it realises , @xmath33 . within a given configuration ,",
    "all ntc have the same topology . ]",
    "consider therefore first the case of a configuration having a single ntc .",
    "for the purpose of studying its topology , we can imagine that is has been shrunk to a line that winds the two periodic directions @xmath27 times . in our approach",
    "we focus on the the properties of the ntc along the direction of propagation of the transfer matrix @xmath17 , henceforth taken as the horizontal direction .",
    "if we imagine cutting the lattice along a vertical line , the ntc will be cut into @xmath28 horizontally percolating parts , which we shall call the @xmath28 _ branches _ of the ntc .",
    "seen horizontally , a given ntc realises a permutation @xmath34 between the vertical coordinates of its @xmath28 branches , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . up to a trivial relabelling of the vertical coordinate ,",
    "the permutation @xmath34 is independent of the horizontal coordinate of the ( imaginary ) vertical cut , and so , forms part of the topological description of the ntc .",
    "we thus describe totally the topology along the horizontal direction of a ntc by @xmath28 and the permutation @xmath35 .",
    "note that there are restrictions on the admissible permutations @xmath34 .",
    "firstly , @xmath34 can not have any proper invariant subspace , or else the corresponding ntc would in fact correspond to several distinct ntc , each having a smaller value of @xmath28 .",
    "for example , the case @xmath36 and @xmath37 is not admissible , as @xmath34 corresponds in fact to two distinct ntc with @xmath32 .",
    "in general , therefore , the admissible permutations @xmath34 for a given @xmath28 are simply cyclic permutations of @xmath28 coordinates .",
    "secondly , planarity implies that the different branches of a ntc can not intersect , and so not all cyclic permutations are admissible @xmath34 .",
    "for example , the case @xmath36 and @xmath38 is not admissible .",
    "in general the admissible cyclic permutations are characterised by having a constant coordinate difference between two consecutive branches , i.e. , they are of the form @xmath39 for some constant @xmath40 , with all coordinates considered modulo @xmath28 . for example , for @xmath36 ,",
    "the only admissible permutations are then finally @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "consider now the case of a configuration with several ntc .",
    "recalling that all ntc belong to the same homotopy class , they must all be characterised by the same @xmath28 and @xmath34 .",
    "alternatively one can say that the branches of the different ntc are entangled .",
    "henceforth we denote by @xmath43 the number of ntc with @xmath44 in a given configuration . note in particular that , seen along the horizontal direction , configurations with no ntc and configurations with one or more ntc percolating only vertically are topologically equivalent .",
    "this is an important limitation of our approach .",
    "let us denote by @xmath45 the partition function of the potts model on an @xmath0 torus , restricted to configurations with exactly @xmath43 ntc characterised by the index @xmath44 and the permutation @xmath46 ; if @xmath34 is not admissible , or if @xmath47 , we set @xmath48 .",
    "further , let @xmath49 be the partition function restricted to configurations with @xmath43 ntc of index @xmath28 , let @xmath50 be the partition function restricted to configurations with @xmath43 ntc _ percolating horizontally _ , and let @xmath16 be the total partition function . obviously , we have @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , and @xmath53",
    ". in particular , @xmath54 corresponds to the partition function restricted to configurations with no ntc , or with ntc percolating only vertically .    in the case of a generic lattice",
    "all the @xmath45 are non - zero , provided that @xmath34 is an admissible cyclic permutation of length @xmath28 , and that @xmath55 .",
    "the triangular lattice is a simple example of a generic lattice .",
    "note however that other regular lattices may be unable to realise certain admissible @xmath34 .",
    "for example , in the case of a square lattice or a honeycomb lattice , all @xmath45 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 are zero , since there is not enough `` space '' on the lattice to permit all ntc branches to percolate horizontally while realising a non - trivial permutation .",
    "such non - generic lattices introduce additional difficulties in the analysis which have to be considered on a case - to - case basis . in the following , except when explicitly stated , we consider therefore the case of a generic lattice .      the construction and structure of the transfer matrix @xmath58",
    "can be taken over from the cyclic case @xcite .",
    "in particular , we recall that @xmath59 acts towards the right on states of connectivities between two time slices ( left and right ) and has a block - trigonal structure with respect to the number of _ bridges _ ( connectivity components linking left and right ) and a block - diagonal structure with respect to the residual connectivity among the non - bridged points on the left time slice . as before ,",
    "we denote by @xmath60 the diagonal block with a fixed number of bridges @xmath19 and a trivial residual connectivity .",
    "each eigenvalue of @xmath58 is also an eigenvalue of one or more @xmath60 . in analogy with @xcite",
    "we shall sometimes call @xmath61 the transfer matrix at level @xmath19 .",
    "it acts on connectivity states which can be represented graphically as a partition of the @xmath14 points in the right time slice with a special marking ( represented as a _ black point _ ) of precisely @xmath19 distinct components of the partition ( i.e. , the components that are linked to the left time slice via a bridge ) .",
    "a crucial difference with the cyclic case is that for a given partition of the right time slice , there are more possibilities for attributing the black points .",
    "namely , a connectivity component which is not _",
    "apparently _ accessible from the left ( and thus markable ) may in fact be so due to the periodic boundary conditions identifying the top and the bottom rows .",
    "this will obviously increase the dimension of the level @xmath19 subspace of connectivities ( for @xmath62 ) .",
    "considering for the moment the black points to be indistinguishable , we denote the corresponding dimension as @xmath63 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that n_tor(l , l ) =    ll & l=0 + 2l-1 l-1 & l=1 + 2l l - l & 2",
    "l l    . and",
    "clearly @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "suppose now that a connectivity state at level @xmath19 is time evolved by a cluster configuration of index @xmath28 and corresponding to a permutation @xmath34 .",
    "this can be represented graphically by adjoining the initial connectivity state to the left rim of the cluster configuration , as represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and reading off the final connectivity state as seen from the right rim of the cluster configuration .",
    "evidently , the positions of the black points in the final state will be permuted with respect to their positions in the intial state , according to the permutation @xmath34 .",
    "as we have seen , not all @xmath34 are admissible , but it turns out to be advantageous to consider formally also the action of non - admissible permutations .",
    "this is permissible since in any case @xmath60 will have only zero matrix elements between states which are related by a non - admissible permutation . since @xmath66 was just defined as the number of possible connectivity states without taking into account the possible permutations between black points ,",
    "the dimension of @xmath67 is @xmath68 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath69 ( where @xmath70 ) the @xmath66 standard connectivity states at level @xmath19 .",
    "the full space of connectivities at level @xmath19 , i.e. , with @xmath19 distinguishable black points , can then be obtained by subjecting the @xmath69 to permutations of the black points .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath60 commutes with the permutations between black points ( the physical reason being that @xmath61 can not `` see '' to which positions on the left time slice each bridge is attached ) .",
    "therefore @xmath60 itself has a block structure in a appropriate basis .",
    "indeed , @xmath60 can be decomposed into @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the restriction of @xmath60 to the states transforming according to the irreducible representation ( irrep ) of @xmath4 corresponding to the young diagram @xmath3 .",
    "one can obtain the corresponding basis by applying the projectors @xmath73 on all the connectivity states at level @xmath19 , where @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 here @xmath75 is the dimension of the irrep @xmath3 and @xmath76 the character of @xmath34 in this irrep .",
    "we have used the fact that all characters of @xmath4 are real .",
    "the application of all possible permutations on any given standard vector @xmath69 generates a regular representation of @xmath4 , which contains therefore @xmath75 representations @xmath3 ( each of dimension @xmath75 ) . as there are @xmath66 standard vectors , the dimension of @xmath71 is thus @xmath77 ^ 2 n_{\\rm tor}(l , l)$ ] .",
    "furthermore , using schur s lemma , we deduce that each of its eigenvalues is ( at least ) @xmath75 times degenerate .",
    "therefore @xmath72 has ( at most ) @xmath78 different eigenvalues , which we shall denote @xmath79 .",
    "( recall our preceeding discussion ) , and thus some @xmath79 with different @xmath19 and/or @xmath3 are in fact equal .",
    "we shall come back to this point later . ]",
    "we now define , as in the cyclic case @xcite , @xmath18 as the trace of @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath60 commutes with @xmath4 , we can write @xmath81 in distinction with the cyclic case , we can not decompose the partition function @xmath16 over @xmath18 because of the possible permutations of black points ( see below ) .",
    "we shall therefore resort to more elementary quantities , the @xmath1 , which we define as the trace of @xmath82 .",
    "since both @xmath60 and the projectors @xmath73 commute with @xmath4 , we have @xmath83 obviously one has @xmath84 the sum being over all the irreps @xmath3 of @xmath4 .",
    "recall that in the cyclic case the amplitudes of the eigenvalues at level @xmath19 are all identical .",
    "this is no longer the case , since the amplitudes depend on @xmath3 as well .",
    "indeed @xmath85 in order to decompose @xmath16 over @xmath1 we first introduce the auxiliary quantities @xmath86 the sum being over permutations @xmath87 belonging to the class @xmath88 .",
    "we then have @xmath89 so @xmath90 ( resp .",
    "@xmath91 ) can be thought of as modified traces in which the final state differs from the initial state by the application of the permutation @xmath92 ( resp .  the class @xmath88 ) .",
    "note that @xmath93 is simply equal to @xmath94 . since the character is the same for all permutations belonging to the same class , eqs .",
    "( [ defkldtor ] ) and ( [ projpd ] ) yield a relation between @xmath1 and @xmath90 : @xmath95 these relations can be inverted so as to obtain @xmath91 in terms of @xmath1 , since the number of classes equals the number of irreps @xmath3 : @xmath96 with the chosen normalisation , the coefficients @xmath97 are integer . multiplying eq .",
    "( [ kldfc ] ) by @xmath98 and summing over @xmath3 , and using the orthogonality relation @xmath99 one easily deduces that @xmath100 we also note that @xmath101 ^ 2 c(d , c_l ) = l ! \\ , \\delta_{c_l,{\\rm i d } }   \\label{cdclsum }   \\label{relcdc}\\ ] ]",
    "by generalising the working for the cyclic case , we can now obtain a decomposition of the @xmath18 in terms of the @xmath49 . to that end",
    ", we first determine the number of states @xmath102 which are _ compatible _ with a given configuration of @xmath49 , i.e. , the number of initial states @xmath102 which are thus that the action by the given configuration produces an identical final state .",
    "the notion of compatability is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .     which are compatible with a given cluster configuration contributing to @xmath103 . ]",
    "we consider first the case @xmath31 and suppose that the @xmath40th ntc connects onto the points @xmath104 .",
    "the rules for constructing the compatible @xmath102 are identical to those of the cyclic case :    1 .",
    "the points @xmath105 must be connected in the same way in @xmath102 as in the cluster configuration .",
    "2 .   the points @xmath104 within the same bridge must be connected in @xmath102 .",
    "3 .   one can independently choose to associate or not a black point to each of the sets @xmath104 .",
    "one is free to connect or not two distinct sets @xmath104 and @xmath106 .    the choices mentioned in rule 3 leave @xmath107 possibilities for constructing a compatible @xmath102 .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath108 in the decomposition of @xmath18 is therefore @xmath109 , since the permutation of black points in a standard vector @xmath102 allows for the construction of @xmath110 distinct states , and since the weight of the @xmath43 ntc in @xmath18 is @xmath24 instead of @xmath111 .",

    "we next consider the case @xmath113 .",

    "[ fig3 ] , the @xmath102 which are compatible with this configuration are such that    1 .",

    "because of the constraint of planarity and the fact that the ntc are entangled , all the different big blocks are automatically connected among themselves .",
