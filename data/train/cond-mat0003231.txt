    "the characteristic feature of al@xmath0ga@xmath1sb / inas heterostructures with @xmath2@xmath30.3 is the overlap of the inas conduction band with the al@xmath0ga@xmath1sb valence band  @xcite .",
    "such systems , often referred to as _ broken gap _",
    "heterostructures , exhibit interesting negative persistent photoconductivity  @xcite , semimetal - semiconductor transition induced by magnetic field  @xcite , and intrinsic exciton  @xcite .",
    "as the al concentration increases from @xmath2=0.3 , a staggered band alignment appears at the al@xmath0ga@xmath1sb / inas interface with the valence band edge of al@xmath0ga@xmath1sb lying in the band gap of inas . on the other hand , at the gasb / al@xmath0ga@xmath1sb interface",
    "the band alignment is of the straddled type .",
    "therefore , in a inas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1sb / gasb heterostructure , carriers can tunnel from the inas conduction band to the gasb valence through the al@xmath0ga@xmath1sb barrier .",
    "inas , gasb , and alsb form a family of semiconductors with sufficient lattice match for epitaxy growth .",
    "interband tunneling devices based on the inas / algasb / gasb double barrier resonant tunneling have been fabricated , which exhibit high frequency response and peak - to - valley current ratio at room temperatures  @xcite .",
    "because of their potential for technological application , resonant tunneling  @xcite and resonant magnetotunneling  @xcite have been investigated extensively .    to the contrary of tunneling processes ,",
    "very little work has been done on the electronic structure and optical properties of broken gap heterostructures  @xcite .",
    "we notice that due to the overlap of inas conduction band and the gasb valence band , it is possible to form new type of eigenstates with interesting optical properties .",
    "we will elaborate this with fig .",
    "[ fig_opprinc ] where the conduction band edge @xmath4 and the valence band edge @xmath5 are marked for a gasb / inas heterostructure embedded in the band gap of alsb . treating the alsb at both sides as potential barriers ,",
    "the system alsb / gasb / inas / alsb is essentially a new type of quantum well which we name as broken gap quantum well ( bgqw ) .",
    "if we diminish the thickness of either the gasb layer or the inas layer to zero , the bgqw reduces to a conventional quantum well which , with bipolar doping becomes a quantum well laser .    if in a properly designed bgqw there exist two eigenenergies as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_opprinc ] , under bipolar doping , the bgqw can lase in the infrared frequency region .",
    "such semiconductor infrared lasers or detectors were proposed earlier  @xcite .",
    "the lower energy state in fig .",
    "[ fig_opprinc ] is characterized by the degree of hybridization between the gasb valence band states and the inas conduction band states .",
    "the enhancement of optical transition requires the hybridized wave function having a large amplitude in the inas layer . on the other hand , to drain out the electrons in the hybridized state in order to acheive the population inversion for lasing , the wave function should have a large component from the gasb layer .",
    "a thorough understanding of this hybridization is important not only for opto - electronic devices , but also for the fundamental theory of transport parallel to interfaces .",
    "the optical property of a bgqw , which is of most theoretical interest and of most importance to opto - electronics , involves the optical transition between these two levels .",
    "hence , relevant issues to be studied are the dependence of optical matrix elements on the degree of conduction - valence hybridization , the tuning of hybridization by varying the width of the gasb layer , and the sensitivity of quantized levels to this tuning . in this paper",
    "we will perform a theoretical calculation of electronic structure and optical matrix elements in order to investigate these items . in sec .",
    "[ sect_model ] we present the model system we study and the basic assumptions in our theoretical calculation .",
    "our results for the electronic structure and optical matrix elements are given in sec .",
    "[ sect_elstruct ] and sec .",
    "[ sect_optmat ] respectively , and discussed in sec .  [ sect_discuss ] .",
    "our model system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_opprinc ] is a gasb / inas heterostructure sandwiched between two thick alsb layers .",
    "the growth direction is [ 001 ] which defines the @xmath6 axis .",
    "the @xmath2 axis is along [ 100 ] and the @xmath7 axis is along [ 010 ] .",
    "this system was studied earlier with a simple two band model  @xcite .",
    "the essential feature of our model is the existence in bgqw quantized conduction band states in the inas layer , and hybridized quantum levels in the energy regime where the gasb valence band overlaps with the inas conduction band .",
    "therefore , for simplicity we can well assume that the two thick alsb layers are bulk alsb .",
    "as an illustration , one conduction band level and one hybridized level are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_opprinc ] .",
    "we will perform band structure calculation for the bgqw shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_opprinc ] .",
    "the lattice constants are 6.096  for gasb , 6.058  for inas , and 6.136  for alsb . with such small lattice mismatch ,",
    "the strain estimated with the deformation potential of these materials is not large enough to modify our conclusion qualitatively .",
    "hence , in our theoretical calculation , strain will be neglected . as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sect_elstruct ] , the essential feature of our model mentioned above , and hence the conclusion reached by our calculation will remain intact even this weak strain effect is taken into account .",
    "we employ the effective bond orbital model  @xcite ( ebom ) which is a tight - binding - like model defined on the bravais lattice of the underlying crystal .",
    "the basis are constructed as linear combinations of orbitals centered on each lattice site having @xmath8- or @xmath9-symmetry , together with spin eigenstates .",
    "the so - constructed basis functions diagonalize the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "our model hamiltonian includes local and nearest neighbor matrix elements .",
    "the degree of inversion asymmetry of the bgqw heterostructure under study is much higher than that of individual inas or gasb constituent layers .",
    "hence , in our calculation the effect of weak inversion symmetry is neglected for simplicity . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong inversion symmetry of the bgqw and its combined effect with the spin - orbit coupling at finite in - plane wavevector are fully taken into account in our theoretical treatment .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the ebom is not an atomistic model like the tight binding model .",
    "while the tight binding model is built from orbitals representing the degree of freedom of each individual atom , the bond - orbitals in the ebom are confined to a primitive unit cell and represent more than one atom .",
    "the symmetry of the ebom is identical to that of the * k*@xmath10*p * model , and therefore in both models there is no asymmetry between the ( 110 ) and ( 1@xmath110 ) directions . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference between the ebom and the * k*@xmath10*p * model is that the * k*@xmath10*p * model is a continum model without a natural momentum cutoff , but the ebom is discretized on the bravais lattice of the crystal .",
    "the bulk parameters of the ebom , which are required for our calculation , are obtained by fitting the bulk band - structure of ebom to that of the * k*@xmath10*p * hamiltonian near the @xmath12 point to the second order in @xmath13 , as described in ref  .",
    "the ebom can therefore be considered as an effective mass theory discretized on the bravais lattice . for small * k * vectors",
    "the two models are equivalent . however , since ebom is discretized on the bravais lattice , it gives better results at large @xmath13 .",
    "it is important to point out that usually , as in the present case , it is not even necessary to know the precise form of the effective bond orbitals .    because of the large overlap between the inas conduction band and the gasb valence band ,",
    "the split - off band must be included in our treatment .",
    "hence , we will deal essentially an eight band kane model .",
    "we consider the bgqw heterostructures grown in the [ 001 ] direction , with @xmath14 labelling the ( 001 ) planes .",
    "then , the position of a lattice site @xmath15 in the @xmath14th plane can be expressed as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the lattice constant of the conventional unit cell .",
    "the eight bond orbitals at each lattice site are conventionally labelled as ( @xmath18 ) , ( @xmath19 ) , ( @xmath20 ) , ( @xmath21 ) , ( @xmath22 ) , ( @xmath23 ) , ( @xmath24 ) , and ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we denote @xmath26 for the @xmath27th bond orbital at position @xmath16 . in terms of these bond orbitals",
    ", we define a basis set of planar orbitals @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an in - plane wave vector , and @xmath30 is the number of sites in each plane .",

    "the partial hamiltonian @xmath33 is diagonal with respect to the in - plane wave vectors @xmath29 , and block - tridiagonal with respect to the remaining quantum numbers .",

    "the symmetry properties of ebom at @xmath29=0 allows the conduction band states in the inas layers to hybridize with the light - hole band states in the gasb layers , but not with the heavy - hole band states .",
    "we would like first to locate the region of bgqw structures in which we can fine tune the degree of such hybridization .",
    "for this purpose , we perform two energy level calculations ; one with zero inas layer width and the other with zero gasb layer width .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_swlev ] as functions of the number of atomic layers .",
    "we see that for 58 atomic layers , the gasb l1 level overlaps with the inas e1 level .",
    "hence , the region around 60 atomic layers will be the reasonable starting bgqw structure for tuning the system into maximum hybridization .",
    "we should be aware of the fact that different confinement boundary conditions also affect the degree of hybridization , as will be seen in our computed results below .",
    "we will then set 60 atomic layers for the inas constituent and vary the gasb width from 30 to 80 atomic layers . in the absence of interface coupling , the h1 , e1 , h2 and l1 levels at @xmath29=0",
    "are shown in fig .",

    "we use the results at 80 atomic layers of gasb to label them as h1@xmath50e1@xmath50h2@xmath50l1 . because of the symmetry properties at @xmath29=0 , the conduction band states have negligible influence on h1 and h2 levels .",
    "the heavy hole levels are only slightly perturbed by the change of boundary conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "the l1 and e1 levels are strongly hybridized and repel each other .",
    "the difference between the solid curves and the dashed curves is also due to the different confinement boundary conditions as mentioned above . in the region of gasb width between 50 and 60 atomic layers ,",
    "the separation of the two resulting hybridized levels is about 40 - 55 mev .    to demonstrate the spatial properties of hybridized states",

    "we see that the tail of the e1 ( or l1 ) state in the gasb ( or inas ) region has the same component profile as its main part in the inas ( or gaas ) region .",
    "such features were also obtained for inas - gasb superlattices in a very recent paper  @xcite .    in our derivation of the eigensolutions of a bgqw heterostructure , the effect of strain has been neglected .",
    "the separations between the so - obtained eigenenergies for @xmath29=0 , which are determined by the confinement potential , are substantially larger than the energy shifts produced by the strain .",
    "hence , even the effect of strain is included in an improved calculation , the formation of e1-l1 hybridized states is still dominated by the confinement potential , and the degree of hybridization can still be tuned by changing the width of the gasb and/or the inas layers . in this respect ,",
    "the conclusion reached with our present calculation will remain intact when the effect of strain is taken into account .",
    "an interesting question is , when a charge carrier occupies a e1-l1 hybridized state , will its physical properties electron - like or hole - like ?",
    "for example , what will be the cyclotron effective mass of such a charge carrier ?",
    "one relevant quantity is the probability @xmath55 to find the electron in inas layers when it occupies the @xmath56th eigenstate .",

    "we will return to these dispersion relations later for further discussions .",
    "we have mentioned that our bgqw system was studied earlier with a simple two - band model  @xcite , where only the h1 and the e1 levels are included .",

    "the lower spin - orbit splited dispersion curve is assigned with a , and the higher one with b.    there are numerous optical transitions between each pair of states for different polarizations of the electromagnetic waves .",
    "the selection rules are complicated by the anticrossing of levels as well as the hybridization between inas conduction band states and gasb valence band states .",
    "hence , here our study will focus on the cases of our interest : the optical transitions from the e2a and e2b levels to the e1a , e1b , h1a , and h1b levels . as will be discussed later ,",
    "such transitions are relevant to the possible infrared lasers based on bgqw heterostructures .",
    "we would like to mention that parallel to our work , in a very recent paper  @xcite , in inas - gasb superlattices the optical transition matrix elements at @xmath29=0 with in - plane polarization were studied as functions of the superlattice period .    by analyzing our extensive numerical results ,",
    "we have reached the following selection rules for transitions from the e2a and e2b levels to the e1a , e1b , h1a , and h1b levels . for @xmath29 in the [",

    "if @xmath29 is along a low symmetry direction in the two - dimensional brillouin zone , such as [ 210 ] for example , all transitions are allowed .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that these selection rules for a bgqw , which is asymmetric , happen to be the same as the selection rules for the intersubband transitions in a symmetric conduction band quantum well , derived with a simplified eight band model  @xcite .",
