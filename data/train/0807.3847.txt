    "<S> in this note i mainly focus on the neutrino physics part in my talk and report the most recent progress made in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the majorana features of neutrinos and so(3 ) gauge flavor symmetry can simultaneously explain the smallness of neutrino masses and nearly tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing when combining together with the mechanism of approximate global u(1 ) family symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the mixing angle @xmath0 and cp - violating phase are in general nonzero and testable experimentally at the allowed sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> the model also predicts the existence of vector - like majorana neutrinos and charged leptons as well as new higgs bosons , some of them can be light and explored at the lhc and ilc .    [ [ section ] ]    </S>",
    "<S> the observed massive neutrinos and dark matter in our universe challenge the standard models of both particle physics and cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> so both flavor physics and cosmology may tell us fundamental physics@xcite . in this note </S>",
    "<S> i will concentrate on discussing the neutrino physics .    </S>",
    "<S> various neutrino experiments@xcite provide more and more stringent constraints on the three mixing angles and mass squared differences for three neutrinos@xcite @xmath1 at the 99% confidence level@xcite . in comparison with the quark sector , it raises a puzzle that why neutrino masses are so tiny , but their mixing angles are so large@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the only peculiar property for neutrinos is that they could be majorana fermions , so a natural solution to the puzzle is most likely attributed to the majorana features . thus revealing the origin of large mixing angles and small masses of neutrinos is important not only for understanding neutrino physics , but also for exploring new physics beyond the standard model@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the current data on the neutrino mixing angles are consistent with the so - called tri - bimaximal mixing with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which was first proposed by harrison , perkins and scott @xcite , and investigated by various groups@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mixing angle @xmath5 is the most unclear parameter and expected to be measured in near future . </S>",
    "<S> such a tri - bimaximal mixing matrix has been found to be yielded by considering some interesting symmetries , especially the discrete symmetries@xcite . in general , it is shown that the discrete symmetries lead to @xmath4 @xcite . in such a case , it is hard to be directly tested experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , it is interesting to consider a non - abelian gauge family symmetry so(3)@xcite instead of discrete symmetries discussed widely in literature . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing matrix is generally obtained as the lowest order approximation from diagonalizing a special symmetric mass matrix@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the greatest success of the standard model ( sm ) is the gauge symmetry structure @xmath6 which has been tested by more and more precise experiments . </S>",
    "<S> so(3 ) gauge family symmetry can be regarded as a simple extension of the standard model with three families and majorana neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that only so(3 ) rather than su(3 ) is allowed due to the majorana feature of neutrinos .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 invariant lagrangian for yukawa interactions of leptons with majorana neutrinos can be constructed as follows@xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are all real yukawa coupling constants and @xmath15 is the mass of right - handed majorana neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> all the fermions @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath22 belong to so(3 ) triplets in family space . where @xmath23 denote @xmath24 doublet leptons , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are @xmath24 doublet higgs bosons with @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 are the right - handed neutrinos with @xmath28 the charge conjugated ones . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 are @xmath24 singlet vector - like charged leptons and the @xmath21 are @xmath24 singlet vector - like majorana neutrinos with @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 is a singlet higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 are so(3 ) tri - triplets higgs bosons satisfying @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 which is required by the hermiticity condition of lagrangian and the majorana condition of vector - like neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the above lagrangian is solely ensured by the following discrete symmetry ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) @xmath38 in terms of so(3 ) representation , one can reexpress the real symmetric tri - triplet higgs boson into the following general form @xmath39 with @xmath40 @xmath22 being the generators of so(3 ) . where @xmath41 @xmath22 may be regarded as three rotational scalar fields of so(3 ) , and @xmath42 @xmath22 are three dilatation scalar fields .    </S>",
    "<S> so(3 ) gauge invariance allows us to fix the gauge by making so(3 ) gauge transformation @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 , we then arrive at the following yukawa interactions @xmath45 which is invariant under @xmath46 transformation . </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath47 remains hermitian and contains nine independent scalar fields , which can generally be reexpressed in terms of so(3 ) representation as the following form @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath22 are regarded as three rotational scalar fields of so(3 ) , @xmath51 @xmath22 denote three phase scalar fields and @xmath52 @xmath22 are three dilation scalar fields .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the following general vacuum structure of scalar fields under the above gauge fixing condition @xmath53 namely @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 ( i=1,2,3 ) are cp phases arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking and @xmath58 are three rotational angles of so(3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> such a vacuum structure after spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to the following mass matrices for neutrinos with a type ii like see - saw mechanism and for charged leptons with a generalized see - saw mechanism @xmath59 with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are given as functions of @xmath58 @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar special symmetric neutrino mass matrix like @xmath68 was also resulted for the dirac - type neutrinos with a new symmetry@xcite and the majorana - type neutrinos with the @xmath46 group@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> when taking the majorana neutrino masses @xmath15 and @xmath68 to be infinity large , the interactions with majorana neutrinos decouple from the theory , @xmath69 which implies that the resulting yukawa interactions in this limit generate additional global u(1 ) family symmetries for the charged lepton sector . </S>",
    "<S> namely , once the majorana neutrinos become very heavy , the yukawa interactions possess approximate global u(1 ) family symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> thus when applying the mechanism of approximate global u(1 ) family symmetries@xcite to the yukawa interactions after so(3 ) symmetry is broken down spontaneously , we have @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , namely @xmath73 which provides a possible explanation why the observed left - handed neutrinos are so light and meanwhile the charged lepton mixing angles must be small . thus the neutrino mass matrix is given by a type ii like see - saw mechanism and the charged lepton mass matrix is presented by a generalized see - saw mechanism . by diagonalizing the mass matrices , we obtain @xmath74 where @xmath75 with @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the so - called tri - bimaximal mixing matrix@xcite . for short , </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced the notations @xmath78 and @xmath79 with @xmath80    as the smallness of charged lepton mixing angles @xmath67 @xmath81 can be attributed to the mechanism of approximate global u(1 ) family symmetries in the yukawa sector , in a good approximation up to the first order of @xmath82 , the leptonic ckm - type mixing matrix in the mass eigenstates of leptons may be expressed as the following simplified form @xmath83    the three vector - like heavy majorana neutrino masses are obtained via diagonalizing the mass matrix @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath84 @xmath85 with @xmath86 the masses of three left - handed light majorana neutrinos are given in the physics basis as follows @xmath87 with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> it then enables us from the experimentally measured neutrino mass squire differences to extract two mass parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 for a given value of parameter @xmath94 with @xmath95 .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results are presented in table 1 by taking the central values of the mass squire differences @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    without losing generality , considering the case @xmath98 </S>",
    "<S> , we then have the following approximate relations @xmath99 which shows that in this case both the mixing angle @xmath100 and the ratio @xmath101 can be determined for the given values of @xmath94 , an interesting solution is @xmath102 for a numerical estimation , it is useful to investigate the following two interesting cases @xmath103 which allows us to present a reasonable estimation for @xmath0 and @xmath104 ( see table 2 ) .    where @xmath105 ( i.e. , @xmath106 ) should be a more general and reasonable case when no symmetry is imposed , the resulting mixing angle @xmath0 can be large enough to be detected . for the case </S>",
    "<S> ii , both mixing angle @xmath0 and cp - violating phase @xmath104 are in general testable by the future neutrino experiments . for the typical range @xmath107 </S>",
    "<S> , we are led to the most optimistic predictions for the mixing angle @xmath0 and cp - violating phase @xmath104 @xmath108 which can be tested in the future experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> when taking the dirac type neutrino masses @xmath109 and @xmath110 to be at the order of @xmath111 mev ( i.e. , at the same order of electron mass ) , and the mass parameter @xmath112  gev , we have the lightest vector - like majorana neutrino masses and charged lepton mass to be @xmath113 which is at the electroweak scale and can be explored at lhc and ilc .    in conclusion , we have shown how the puzzles on the smallness of neutrino masses and the nearly tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing may simultaneously be understood in the flavor so(3 ) gauge symmetry model with the mechanism of approximate global u(1 ) family symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum structure of so(3 ) symmetry breaking for the so(3 ) tri - triplet higgs bosons plays an important role . </S>",
    "<S> the mixing angle @xmath0 is in general nonzero and its typical values range from the experimentally allowed sensitivity to the current experimental bound . </S>",
    "<S> cp violation in the lepton sector is caused by a spontaneous symmetry breaking and can be significantly large for exploring via a long baseline neutrino experiment . a similar consideration can be extended to the quark sector , unlike the lepton sector with the features of majorana neutrinos , the mechanism of approximate global u(1 ) family symmetry can be applied to understand the smallness of quark mixing angles . </S>"
