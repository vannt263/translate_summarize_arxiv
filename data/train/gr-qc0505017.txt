    "classical black holes , are observational realities , however the semi classical physics associated with them remains to be explained . the black hole horizon is attributed with entropy , temperature , and a non - unitary form of thermal radiation or hawking radiation@xcite . what is the microscopic origin of entropy ?",
    "how does a quantum mechanical wavefunction describe the horizon ? is the quantum black hole a pure state in the quantum theory ? why does the horizon radiate , and what is the end point of evaporation ? despite many plausible explanations , little has been achieved to demonstrate the complete truth .",
    "further , classical general relativity predicts destruction of all material falling inside the horizon due to the presence of a central singularity .",
    "do all the material accreting into the black hole perish at the central singularity even in a quantum mechanical description ?",
    "the answers to these questions requires a full understanding of quantum geometry , as at distances of the order of planck length near the singularity , quantum effects will dominate over the classical prediction of a curvature singularity .",
    "to obtain such a quantum description , one needs a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "however , a complete theory of quantum gravity does not exist , though glimpses of truth have emerged in certain regimes .",
    "one such regime has been semiclassical gravity , where previously , quantum fields in curved space - time @xcite were studied .",
    "gravity remained classical .",
    "however , with the development of non - perturbative quantum gravity , relevant questions where one could ` semiclassically quantise ' a given space - time have been answered to a certain extent .",
    "semiclassical states have been constructed in canonical quantum gravity and we discuss the coherent states in this paper .",
    "these states have been well known in quantum mechanics and are ` wave packets ' as opposed to exact eigenstates .",
    "they provide the closest approximation to classical physics as uncertainty is minimum here and the states are peaked in both the momentum and position representations",
    ". thus expectation value of both momentum and configuration space variables are closest to their classical values as measured in these states . in case of canonical gravity , where time is separated , and",
    "the intrinsic metric of constant time slices and the extrinsic curvature constitute the phase space , these states can be used to build a entire space - time . here a given black hole space - time with spatial slicings which include the horizon and the central singularity are discussed . to locate the apparent horizon and the central singularity one has to measure both the intrinsic metric and the extrinsic curvature of the spatial slice .",
    "this ` simultaneous ' measurement is possible in the coherent states , as they are peaked in both the phase space variables , and the uncertainty is minimum .",
    "this would have been impossible in any other semi - classical state , where measuring the extrinsic curvature would have resulted in a complete uncertainty of the intrinsic metric .",
    "coherent states for gravity were constructed in @xcite using a formalism due to hall . in this article",
    ", we address coherent states for black holes , first introduced in @xcite , and then used to derive the entropy of the black hole apparent horizon @xcite .",
    "we give a complete derivation of a density matrix for the apparent horizon here by tracing over the wavefunction inside the horizon .",
    "the entropy is then obtained by the definition @xmath0 .",
    "this gives entropy to be proportional to area of the horizon in the first approximation , modulo a constant , which can be fixed to @xmath1 due the the immirzi parameter ambiguity in the formulation of the theory .",
    "the curvature operator or the kretschmann scalar expectation value is also studied in detail in the states .",
    "the central singularity in the classical curvature is clearly resolved in the semiclassical expectation value of the operator , mainly due to the uncertainty which prevents any measurement of area 0 .",
    "thus a upper bound exists for the curvature operator value proportional to the semiclassical parameter @xmath2 which measures quantum fluctuations around a given classical geometry .",
    "as the semiclassical parameter goes to zero , the singularity re - appears indicating classical physics .",
    "the area operator is also examined here , as this crucially determines the entropy - area law .",
    "the classical value of the area as measured is given by equispaced numbers , and the entropy is actually proportional to the degeneracy of the area operator .",
    "the apparent horizon equation , which introduces correlations in the coherent state wavefunction does not impose any additional constraints on the area eigenvalues , and hence the counting yields a different value of the immirzi parameter as obtained in @xcite .    in the first section , we review the coherent states , and in the next section we give an introduction to the classical phase space for gravity and discuss applications of coherent states to the same .",
    "the canonical variables , the black hole phase space , the corresponding coherent state , and a evaluation of the expectation value of the curvature operator are discussed next .",
    "the apparent horizon equation is examined in details , and a method of isolating the boundary conditions to be imposed on the coherent state wavefunction is analysed .",
    "the apparent horizon is a difference equation in the canonical discretised variables , and introduces correlations across the horizon . when the wavefunction inside the horizon is traced the density matrix describing the black hole space - time",
    "is described .",
    "the entropy and the immirzi parameter are discussed , and the article concludes with a discussion and projects for future .",
    "the entire formulation here for the derivation of the entropy can be extended to include space - times with spherically symmetric apparent horizons .",
    "the coherent states are constructed to obtain classical physics from quantum mechanics .",
    "the origin of these states is well known in quantum mechanics for the simple harmonic oscillator , where the states appear as eigenstates of the annihilation operator @xmath3 , ( @xmath4 is a label and represents a point in the complexified classical phase space @xmath5 , @xmath6 denotes position and @xmath7 are momentum ) . in general , according to klauder @xcite , coherent states are labelled by a continuous parameter @xmath4 , and provide a overcomplete basis for the hilbert space , for a appropriate measure @xmath8 .",

    "i quote from @xcite : _ classical dynamics is quantum dynamics restricted to the only quantum degrees of freedom that may possibly be varied at a macroscopic level , namely , the mean position and the mean momentum ( or velocity ) .",
    "_ this statement follows from the assumption that the classical action principle can be derived from a ` quantum action principle ' if the states of hilbert space are restricted to the coherent states .",

    "the observation of @xcite is that the coherent states comprise a restricted set , and in all the exactly solvable systems , the states yield the classical system . in case of gravity ,",
    "a different set of definitions have been used to generalise the coherent state structure .",
    "the basic features however remain the same .",
    "+ 1)the states are labelled by points in the classical phase space , + 2)they provide a resolution of unity .",
    "+ the new definition of the coherent state generalised to gravity is due to hall , @xcite . in a coherent state transform states in the configuration space ( @xmath18)are taken to states in the hilbert space defined on the holomorphic sector of the complexified phase space ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the kernel of the transformation is a coherent state wavefunction .",
    "the wavefunction is also the analytic continuation of the heat kernel of the laplacian , which after appropriate normalisation corresponds to the kernel that appears in the kernel of the coherent state transform @xcite .",
    "the coherent state obtained thus , coincides with the harmonic oscillator coherent state wavefunction , which is a eigenstate of the annihilation operator .",
    "the coherent state transform can be now defined for hilbert spaces for arbitrary gauge compact gauge groups , in particular for su(2 ) .",
    "canonical gravity in the ashtekar - barbero - immirzi variables takes the form of a su(2 ) gauge theory with additional constraints due to diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "the generalisation of the coherent states to a diffeomorphism invariance context appears in @xcite , and a complete study of their properties are in a series of papers in @xcite .",
    "a very interesting question arises : is there a similar ` quantum action ' principle as in ( [ quant ] ) for gravity , and if so do the coherent states restrict the action to the ` classical action ' as in ( [ class ] ) ?",
    "this indeed is a very difficult question , as no one knows a ` corresponding ' schrodinger equation for the quantum gravity states , and the only known ` equivalent ' equation , the wheeler- dewitt , equation is derived from the classical action , ( @xmath20 ) , where @xmath21 is the lapse .",
    "hence would not qualify as a ab initio ` quantum equation ' ( the schrodinger equation is not derived from the classical action for quantum mechanics ) . for the hall",
    "coherent states , the sho coherent states are recovered in case of @xmath18 , and equation ( [ abc ] ) is indeed true . however , for the coherent states of gravity , which are defined on su(2 ) group , what would be the corresponding equations for ( [ quant ] ) and ( [ class ] ) .",
    "we discuss this in the next section , after identifying the phase space for gravity . for the sake of clarity",

    "@xmath4 takes values in the complexified phase space , and corresponds to the continuous label of states as per the definition in @xcite , and the other parameter @xmath2 , is essentially the ` semiclassicallity ' parameter .",

    "this is effectively a discretisation of space , and one defines the basic variables over graphs , and their duals . in @xcite",
    ", thiemann explored the variables originally defined by ashtekar and lewandowski further , and succeeded in ` quantising ' these graph dependent variables , and also obtained the appropriate classical limit for these operators .",
    "the variables are : h_e(a ) = p ( _ e a )   p^i_e(a , e ) = [ t^i h_e _ s h_*e h_^-1 h_e^-1 ] [ eq : disc ] ( @xmath60 are the generators of su(2)(@xmath61 are pauli matrices ) , and @xmath28 is a dimensionfull parameter , usually fixed as a function of the parameters in the classical theory ) .",

    "the coherent state is constructed to be peaked at the sl(2,c ) valued element .",
    "the classical action for these discrete variables ( for a particular edge ) will be ( on the constrained surface ) : s= d  tr [ t^i  h^-1_e ( ) p_e^i ] [ eq : kin ] if we define the ` quantum action ' principle for gravity in a similar way , except that one confines oneself to the derivation of the kinetic term ( [ eq : kin ] ) , as above , then , it has the form : s_q= d where @xmath65 is a arbitrary state in the quantum hilbert space , then does one recover ( [ eq : kin ] ) by confining oneself to the coherent state ? or in other words , what is s_resquantum = d    ( where @xmath66 is the coherent state for a single edge . ) strangely enough , though in a rather straightforward calculation ( reported in the appendix(a ) ) ) , one recovers ( [ eq : kin ] ) , in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "so in principle , we have succeeded in deriving a appropriate phase space for gravity , for which a coherent state can be defined , in a very similar manner to any other quantum mechanical system , and they give classical physics .",

    "a su(2 ) hilbert space is associated with one edge , and the complete description of the entire manifold , is a tensor product of hilbert spaces of all the edges comprising the graph .",

    "however , for this article , we will confine the discussion to the gauge covariant coherent state , and in the conclusion , comment on the complications which can arise in a gauge invariant state .",
    "to end the discussion of the coherent state for gravity , we emphasise the following two labels : + 1)the classical phase space label @xmath69 .",
    "these variables satisfy all the constraints by construction . despite the discretisation involved through the definition of a graph ,",
    "the variables respect the inherent continuity in the classical metric .",
    "+ 2)the semi - classicality parameter @xmath2 .",
    "+ the actual coherent state is defined over the tensor product of hilbert spaces , which for asymptotically flat manifolds can require a infinite tensor product of hilbert spaces @xcite . +",
    "the classical phase space for the spherically symmetric sector in gravity , will be constituted by schwarzschild black holes .",
    "clearly , one already knows the spherically symmetric classical solution of einstein s equation in vacuum , and for this metric , all the constraints are satisfied .",
    "the intriguing part is to isolate the graph dependence to derive the discrete classical phase space of equation ( [ eq : disc ] ) .",
    "what exactly would be an appropriate graph ? obviously whatever the graph , the classical discretisation has to be spherically symmetric .",
    "one very convenient set of graphs is to take edges along the coordinate lines @xmath70 with appropriate discrete labels attached to them .",
    "this was what was done in @xcite .",
    "the dual polyhedronal decomposition is then comprised of spherical surfaces which intersect the edges at their middle points .",
    "the holonomy and the momenta are calculated in @xcite , and their behaviour analysed .",
    "the radial holonomy and the corresponding radial momentum have the expressions : h_e_r = ( \\{1r_2 ^ 1/2 - 1r_1 ^ 1/2 } ) - ^1 ( \\ { - 1r_1 ^ 1/2 } ) [ eq : rad ] where @xmath71 is the begining of the edge , and @xmath72 is the end of the edge .",
    "( @xmath73 for @xmath74 ) .",
    "the holonomy is ofcourse independent of the angular coordinates of the begining and the end of the edge .",
    "though the holonomy depends on the extrinsic curvature which diverges at the singularity , there is no such divergence in the regulated ` holonomy ' .",
    "the evaluation of the momenta is a little complicated , as it involves the evaluation of the integral on a two surface , with the triad convoluted with the holonomies associated with paths from a generic point to the point at which the edge intersects the two surface . as given in the above figure , the point of intersection of the edge with the surface",
    "is denoted as o and has the coordinates ( r,@xmath75 ) , \\{in the final expressions @xmath76 does not contribute}. the width of the surface is from @xmath77 , and a linear dependence on the width in the @xmath78 direction , which is suppressed here for brevity .",
    "the width along the radial edge is given by @xmath79 .",
    "for details see @xcite , p^i_e_r = tr[momv2 ] x(r)= x_1(r)^1 + x_3(r ) ^2 + x_3 ^3 with x_1(r)&= & _ 0 [ int ] + x_3(r)&= & _ 0 [ int2 ] where @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "now , one uses the above in ( [ momv2 ] ) , to get the following result for the momentum components p^1_e_r = & & p^2_e_r = + & & p^3_e_r = [ momb ] ( @xmath82 ) . p_e_r & = & = [ momq ] + & = & ^1/2 also , this complicated dependence on the coordinate point @xmath83 at which the edge intersects the dual surface becomes clear , when one takes the size @xmath84 of the surface to be very fine .",
    "one notes that as the graphs get finer , the above approximates @xmath85 ( restoring the width @xmath78 ) : p_e_r = 2 _ 0 .    which is the area of the 2-surface which a edge intersects at it s middlepoint .",
    "clearly , the classical value of area is given as above .",
    "question is , when one lifts the variable @xmath86 to an operator , is it diagonalised in a area eigenstate ?",
    "the answer is yes , in a exact orthonormal eigenstate , this corresponds to the area operator and has the eigenvalue @xmath87 .",
    "however , when we evaluate the expectation value in the coherent state , classical area is corrected from this exact eigenvalue , and in the limit @xmath25 this has a different spectrum as we observe in section ( [ sub : equispace ] ) . before one discusses the coherent state defined for these variables ,",
    "some crucial points need to be noted : + 1)the holonomy and the momenta remain finite numbers even in the vicinity of the singularity .",
    "this can be attributed to a regularisation achieved due to the discretisation .",
    "+ 2)the variables are continuous across the horizon , and contain information about the apparent horizon .",
    "+ 3)for very fine graphs , one obtains as @xmath88 the classical area of the bit of the dual surface , induced by the classical metric .",
    "+      the coherent state for the black hole phase space can be written explicitly as in @xcite .",
    "the states are peaked at the classical values , and are well behaved in the entire black hole slice . due to the fact that the classical variables @xmath89 are themselves well behaved , there is no large fluctuations in the quantum corrections , at the horizon , or even at the vicinity of the singularity .",
    "this is a indication of the ` minimum uncertainty ' principle obeyed by the states .",
    "the deviation around the mean value of both the momentum , and the holonomy are measured by the variance , and they are such that = h_e [ eq : un ] which being the classical holonomy , by equation ( [ eq : rad ] ) is always within the value @xmath90 in magnitude . hence , the coherent states , are ideal to study the semi - classical regime , and due to the ` regularisation ' achieved in the set of variables , here , the semiclassical approximation is valid in the entire black - hole slice .",
    "the coherent state in the configuration space representation has the following expression ^t(gh^-1 ) = _ j(2 j + 1 ) e^-t j(j+1)/2_j(gh^-1 ) where @xmath91 labels the eigenvalue of the su(2 ) casimir , and @xmath37 corresponds to the character of the corresponding irreducible representation . the corresponding momentum representation ,",
    "is determined by taking a ` fourier transform ' in the character space of the irreducible states , and one obtaines = e^-t j(j+1)/2_j(g)_mn these are the position and momentum representations of the coherent state peaked at individual edges , with the classical values encoded in the sl(2,c ) valued variable @xmath69 . in this paper",
    "we make a very interesting observation for the state which is peaked at the classical value of @xmath92 or area = 0 , with arbitrary holonomy . for this state ,",
    "the expectation value of the area operator is however non - zero , and proportional to @xmath2 , as expected from the minimum uncertainty criteria demonstrated in equation ( [ eq : un ] ) .",
    "there appears to be two different questions regarding the spectrum of the area operator .",
    "+ 1)the eigenvalue of the area operator as obtained in an exact eigenstate .",
    "+ 2)the spectrum of the area of the black hole horizon , as measured in a appropriate quantum state or a semiclassical state .",
    "+ regarding the first question , the usual regularisation of the area operator @xcite gives the eigenvalue of the area operator intersected by a edge to be : @xmath93 in a kinematical eigenstate of the same operator @xcite . in this context , in @xcite it is claimed that the su(2 ) casimir , whose square root is proportional to the area operator undergoes a _ renormalisation _ and gives the area _",
    "eigenvalue _ as @xmath94 , in it s eigenstate @xcite . a previous computations of entropy , counted the degrees of freedom of a boundary chern simons theory at the horizon , given that the area of the horizon assumed certain values as measured in exact eigenstates associated with edges crossing the horizon .",
    "these edges as consistent with the previous calculations induced the horizon with bits of area @xmath95 .    the calculation which explains the semi - classical processes like black hole entropy or hawking",
    "radiation should arise from a appropriate semi - classical limit of a quantum theory . to recover ` semi - classical '",
    "entropy one needs to find the microscopic degrees of freedom corresponding to a given _ classical _ black hole space - time .",
    "the only well known states in a quantum theory which give classical physics are the coherent states .",
    "so , in a coherent state , the classical horizon area should be the ` expectation value ' of an area operator . as discussed in section([susec : clas ] ) , the variable @xmath88 corresponds to classical area .",
    "it is interesting to study the momentum representation of the coherent state wavefunction , which is expanded in the area eigenstates to determine the classical area as a function of the area eigenvalue or the su(2 ) casimir eigenvalue @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath96 where @xmath97 is the jth irreducible representation of @xmath98 which is an su(2 ) valued matrix encoding information about the classical variables .",

    "hence , the classical area is @xmath101 , with maximum probability .",
    "it is also the expectation value of the operator @xmath102 in an exact eigenstate , where @xmath103 is the usual area operator .",
    "thus the classical area has a corrected spectrum determined by the _",
    "discrete numbers @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "note that the word ` spectrum ' has to be used with caution as this is actually the expectation value of the area operator in a coherent state .",
    "more precisely , given that the area operator is @xmath103 , the expectation value of the operator in the coherent state is of the form : = < |a| > = 1||||^2_j t  ( 2j+1 ) |_j(g)_mn e^-tj(j+1)_j(g)_jmn using @xmath105 and @xmath106 and @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",

    "this observation is not contradictory to the previous work on area spectrum of loop quantum gravity , where the measurement is in an exact eigenstate .",
    "note , in the @xmath25 limit , to assign a finite area , one has to take @xmath113 , and hence the equispaced spectrum assigns a continuous value as the non - equispaced spectrum : @xmath114 to the area .",

    "this degeneracy gives a degeneracy associated with a given horizon area .",
    "why this should be the entropy of a black hole is the subject of discussion in the next few sections .",
    "in the next subsection however , we discuss the resolution of the singularity at the center of the black hole .",
    "we will now concentrate on the specific coherent state , whose classical label has contributions only from the unitary component of @xmath69 , namely the holonomy , and the @xmath118 , or the classical area induced by the particular edge is 0 .",
    "( or @xmath119 ) . in this particular choice of graph , this will happen for areas induced by edges close to @xmath120 .",
    "the coherent state is : |^t_0 ( h_cl ) > = _ jmnd_j e^-t j(j+1)/2_j(h_cl)_mn|jmn >    in the above @xmath121 , as the @xmath118",

    "e^-j(j+1)t _ j(1 ) + & = & 12 t + o(t^2 ) [ eq : area0 ] in equation ( [ eq : area1 ] ) , one uses @xmath122 , and @xmath123    any measurement on the coherent state gives the classical expectation value only when @xmath25 , even a tiny amount of @xmath2 would ensure that there is minimum area which one can measure in the coherent states .",
    "thus one obtaines in some sense a minimum radius which can be measured in the spherically symmetric coordinates , = r_min^2_0 for each edge . which gives the value of @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the number of edges inducing the total area of the sphere .",
    "thus even for a infinitesimal @xmath2 , and fine graph , there is a minimum radius and this uncertainty leads to a resolution of the singularity as we shall subsequently observe .",
    "the curvature scalar @xmath126 will consist of contributions from the intrinsic metric , as well as contributions from the extrinsic curvature .",
    "these are of the form : r_^ = q^a _ q^b _ q^c_ q_d^ r^d_abc - k_k_^ + k_k_^ clearly , when the intrinsic metric is taken to be flat , one has the curvature scalar as r_^ r^ _ = 2[ext ] ( in principle there can be order @xmath2 corrections to the intrinsic curvature , but to first order , the contribution is essentially zero . hence we ignore the intrinsic curvature terms here . )",
    "this quantity diverges at @xmath120 classically for the schwarzschild metric .",
    "one can write the entire above expression in terms of the regularised holonomy and momenta . to see the form",
    ", we write the expression for the extrinsic curvature in the form : k_ab = e_b i further , the spin connection @xmath127 is written in terms of the momenta : ^i_a & = & 12 ^ijk e^b_k + & + & 14 ^ijk e^b_kthe entire curvature is then finally written in terms of the two operators @xmath128 and their expectation values in the coherent states . the @xmath129 operator is r^2 & = & 2 [ eq : curv ] before one actually lifts the above expression to a operator equation @xmath130 , one must also express inverse powers of triads which appear in the equation([eq : curv ] ) , in terms of poisson brackets .",
    "thus a measurement of @xmath129 in the coherent state will be obtained after one has replaced the @xmath131 and the @xmath132 in terms of the holonomy and the corresponding momentum , and the regularised expression for the inverse triads @xmath133 .",
    "_ in the vicinity of the singularity , the terms containing @xmath127 donot contribute to the singularity of the curvature but all go to zero at @xmath120 , and hence can be ignored in the calculation for the upper bound of the curvature operator_. it is the terms containing @xmath131 which are potentially divergent .",
    "thus in the curvature operator , we retain the terms independent of the spin connection .",
    "note , as discussed later for the apparent horizon equation , it is possible to write the extrinsic curvature operator solely in terms of the gauge connection operator , and the triad operator , by using the immirzi parameter ( [ eq : ext12 ] ) .",
    "hence all the derivations for the extrinsic curvature , here will be true , when one takes into considerations the appropriate @xmath46 of the theory .",
    "however , for the next few discussions , we ` ignore ' the spin connection in the computation of the curvature operator in the vicinity of the singularity .",
    "since the quantum fluctuations are always small , one can never induce large values for the spin connection operator , when their classical value is 0 .",
    "thus for a measurement of the curvature operator in the coherent state , in the vicinity of the singularity , it is always justified to ignore the spin connection operator .    before evaluating the expectation value of the curvature operator",
    ", we make the following observations on the operator ordering ambiguity which occurs for the operators which are functions of both @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "these will clarify some of our assumptions and calculations .    in field theories ,",
    "operator ordering ambiguities often lead to infinities .",
    "however , for these coherent states , the ambiguities are proportional to @xmath2 and should go to zero in the classical limit",
    ". this observation might not be true when the classical geometry itself has a singularity .",
    "to investigate the situation where the classical geometry itself is singular , we take a arbitrary function of @xmath136 with , the normal ordering defined as & = & < | ( p^i_e ) h_e| > + < |[(p^i_e ) , h_e]| > + & = & ( p^i_e h_e)_cl +   t^i ( h_e)_cl + o(t^2 ) clearly , the operator ordering ambiguity is proportional to @xmath137 .",
    "let us examine the radial case , clearly , since by equation ( [ eq : rad ] ) , we find that taking one of the end points of the edges to @xmath138 ,    h_e_r = ( ) ( ) & + & ( ) ( ) + + ^1 the limits @xmath139 oscillate within the finite limits @xmath140 . hence in terms of the ` regularised variables ' taking the limit to the singularity does not affect the coherent state , and as such , indeed the coherent state can be defined in terms of the regularised classical variables , even in the vicinity of the singularity .",
    "thus now any arbitrary polynomial in terms of the holonomy and momenta , can be obtained as a expectation value and classical limit determined even at the singularity .",
    "thus we proceed to write the curvature operator in terms of the holonomy and momentum , and find the expectation value .",
    "it is a interesting calculation to realise how the classical singularity can be recovered from a ` finite regulated ' holonomy , for example , with equation ( [ eq : rad ] ) , the radial gauge field e.g. will be : a^i_r = -[t^i ( h_e_r -1 ) ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the begining and end points of the edge respectively . now the most general form of the holonomy can be taken as @xmath141 , which implies a^i_r & = & -[t^i - + ] + & = & + here the interesting observation is that now in the particular value of holonomy calculated above : @xmath142 , which by itself is divergent in the limit @xmath143 .",
    "@xmath144 , and the @xmath145 factor infinitely oscillates from -1 .. 1 as @xmath146 is diverges .",
    "thus , even in the value of @xmath147 , the divergence does not appear to show up , in the regularised variables or the extrinsic curvature of the manifold if there exists a minimum edge length .",
    "however , it is the question of taking limits , and if somehow , one shrinks the edgelength faster than the limit @xmath148 , then the @xmath145 factor can be approximated as @xmath146 , and the following divergence appears : & = & ( r_1 ^ -1/2 - r_2 ^ -1/2 ) + & = & in the limit @xmath149 and @xmath150 , this is indeed a singular value of the extrinsic / gauge connection recovered .",
    "thus it is very clear that in terms of the regularised variables , even the existence of a minimum edge length gives a upper bound on the curvature proportional to @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the minimum edge length .",
    "as described above for a non - zero value of @xmath2 , there is a minimum area one can measure in the coherent states , which would also give a bound on the length of the edges as measured .",
    "however , we will attempt to measure the curvature directly using instead the regularised extrinsic curvature operator , and demonstrate a possible resolution of the singularity in terms of the coherent states .",
    "first let us approximate @xmath45 , ( ignoring @xmath127 ) using the usual regularisation as follows : k_ab = - a^i_a e^i_b using the previous regularisations of the inverse triad , one can obtain a suitable expression as follows : writing @xmath153 $ ] , note that @xmath154 is a graph dependent constant , which is necessary , as the volume operator , defined in terms of the @xmath155 is graph dependent .",
    "in fact as in @xcite , the constants are fixed here by calculating the poisson bracket of the holonomy operator with the volume operator . since @xmath156 , the poisson bracket of the holonomy with the volume operator is : \\{h_e , v}&= & \\{h_e , } + & = & 12 v \\{h_e , 13 ! ^ijk_abc p^a_i",

    "( @xmath159 denote the edge lengths along the coordinate directions ) .",
    "thus , now multiplying by @xmath160 and taking trace , gives the constant to be c_e_a= [ const ]    in the quantum commutator , @xmath161 .",
    "k_ab = c_e_b tr[t^i]tr[t^i h_e_b^-1[h_e_b , v ] ] [ eq : quant ]    = c_e_b < |tr[t^i ] tr[t^i ( v- h^-1_e_b v h_e_b)]]| > however , to avoid the presence of the double trace in the operator and one instead uses the following regularisation of the extrinsic curvature : k_ab & = - & a_a^i e_b^i + & = & [ eq : regt ] ( @xmath162 denote the begining and end point of an edge ) . with the classical value recovered in the limit the edge length goes to zero .",
    "the @xmath163 denotes the holonomy along the edge @xmath164 , and @xmath165 is the corresponding volume operator .",
    "the poisson brackets give the inverse triads and the limit the edge lengths go to zero , one is left with the classical expression for the extrinsic curvature . however , when one lifts the above to an operator equation , the operator ordering is taken to be : k_ab = [ reg ] as this ensures that the diagonal components are recovered appropriately .",
    "for the radial component of the extrinsic curvature , one obtains : k_rr =    thus a typical term in the evaluation of the curvature will include the volume operator . to find the spectrum of the volume operator in these coherent states",
    ", we have to derive the operator in more details .      as in contrast to previous derivations of the volume operator , here ,",
    "there exists a classical metric , to fix the constants and the exact expression for the operator in terms of the gauge invariant vector fields",
    ". we will proceed in the following manner : firstly , we fix the classical volume in terms of the graph degrees of freedom , and then lift the obtained expression to a operator in the quantum theory . the volume operator will be obviously adapted to the specific graph chosen . here",
    "we will also focus on a set of vertices in a local region r. the dual polyhedronal decomposition of the manifold will be important in the determination of the individual volume cells . here , the graph has been taken to be 6-valent with three ingoing and three outgoing edges at a given vertex .",
    "since the classical intrinsic metric has been taken in the spherical coordinates , the edges are aligned along the coordinate directions . as described before the triads are smeared over the dual 2-surfaces which the edges intersect at their midpoints .",
    "the dual surfaces constitute a volume cell , with a vertex at the center of the cell .",
    "this geometric construction very conveniently follows from the definition @xcite .",
    "the figure shows clearly the construction of the volume cell , and each vertex is surrounded by the dual surfaces forming the walls .",
    "the volume associated with each vertex is therefore v= where @xmath166 are a triplet of edges intersecting at the vertex . for a generic vertex located at the point ( as measured by the classical metric ) @xmath167 ,",
    "the classical volume as evaluated from above can be evaluated . typically , for the edges ingoing at the vertex , contribute with ( [ momb ] ) [ for the momentum of angular edges @xcite ] , p^1_e_r = ( r-)^2 ( _ 0-/2 )  p^2_e_= ( r-/2 ) ( _ 0- )  p^3_e _ = ( r- /2 ) the contribution from the outgoing edges are similarly of the form : p^1_e_r= ( r + ) ^2 ( _ 0 + /2 )  p^2_e_= ( r+ /2 ) ( _ 0 + )  p^3_e _ = ( r+ /2 ) the determinant to first order in the edges of the cube ( @xmath168 ) is obtained as : v= r^2_0 which is the required volume of the cell .",
    "thus the entire volume of the manifold can be obtained as the sum of the volume of the cells .",
    "the spectrum of the volume is then obtained in the coherent state by using the standard techniques .",
    "the operator @xmath59 is replaced by the right invariant vector fields @xmath169 and then the expectation value of the operator is obtained in the state .",
    "this operator is of course quite similar to previous derivations , however , here the basic cell is prompted by the classical metric , and the six - valent graph adapted to that .",
    "now , to evaluate explicit matrix elements , in the coherent states , one obtaines the following : = < |^abc_ijk x^a_i",
    "x^b_j x^c_k|>. this operator , again due to a trick due to thiemann , can be written as : _",
    "ijk x^a_i x^b_j x^c_k = [ ( x^a+ x^c)^2 , ( x^b + x^c)^2 ] which however is not a convenient set of operators at this juncture , as we are interested mainly in the classical limit , where a naive evaluation of the operator expectation values gives 0 , ( recall that due to the nature of the classical metric , @xmath170 = 0 ) .",
    "instead , we use the sperical symmetry of the classical metric to equate the following : _ t0",
    "< v > = limit_t0<p_r > as @xmath171 has the same magnitude as @xmath172",
    ". this would be true only at the first order in the metric , and the result will be considerably different in higher order corrections in the semiclassicality parameter @xmath2 .",
    "however , since we are interested in a plausible resolution of the singularity , we approximate the volume operator at this level of the discussion by the above .      to find the expectation value of the curvature operator in the coherent state , we evaluate the explicit expressions of the complete operator .",
    "the operator is taken as a density 1 operator as this gives some nice properties .",
    "thus , the operator is of the form : r^2 by construction .",
    "this as by equation ( [ ext ] ) now has the form ( including only the potentially diverging terms ) : & & 2 + & & 2 [ extr ]    the regularisation of the extrinsic curvature is then used as from equation ( [ eq : regt ] ) , however , the inverse metric @xmath173 , when regularised , introduces inverse powers of @xmath174 , which are then absorbed into the poisson brackets in the numerator , and also with a point splitting method introduced by thiemann .",
    "this essentially has the following method , which uses the fact that : 1 & = & + & = & ^ijk^abc e^a_i e^b_j e^c_k + & = & ^ijk ^abc trtrtr[point]the above poisson brackets then add to the brackets with the volume , and the inverse powers in the denominator can then be absorbed in the numerators .",
    "we concentrate in the first term of equation ( [ extr ] ) , and an explicit expression with the extrinsic curvatures is the following : k^4 = ( q^1/4 k ^2)(q^1/4 k^2 ) = ( k^2)^2 now , we find using the point splitting of equation ( [ point ] ) , and the regularisation of the extrinsic curvature of equation([reg ] ) : & & k^2 + & = & ^ijk ^mnp trtrtr + & & tr[h_e_a^-1\\{h_e_a , v } h_e_b ] tr where by @xmath175 we denote the length of the edges along those directions .",
    "the numerator has five poisson brackets , whereas the denominator has the power of volume @xmath176 , which when absorbed in the five brackets , gives a contribution of @xmath177 for each .",
    "thus now the first term of the operator in equation ( [ extr ] ) has the form : & & ^2 [ exp ] now , the subsequent task is to find the expectation value of the operator in the coherent states , by first lifting the poisson brackets to commutators .",
    "thus now rather lengthy expressions occur , though the calculation is quite straightforward .",
    "one of the main observation in the evaluation of the operators which are product of quite a few terms is the fact that one can insert the complete set of coherent states which are resolutions of unity .",
    "though the states peaked at different @xmath98 are not orthogonal to each other , the overlap function vanishes as @xmath25 , and hence the contribution to first order in @xmath2 will be from the terms which are expectation values at the same @xmath98 . in other words to quote a theorem in @xcite , @xmath178 is exponentially vanishing as @xmath25 ( @xmath179 is the liouville measure ) . _",

    "thus , the geometry of the slice is built using a coherent state , such that it includes the apparent horizon , and then one can proceed to integrate out the wavefunction which is inside the apparent horizon , and obtain a suitable ` entropy of the apparent horizon ' . in the following discussion , we shall talk about apparent horizons which have @xmath203 topology .",
    "given a coherent state , we try to re - build the classical space - time by evaluating the expectation values of momenta and the holonomy in these states .",
    "we recover the information about the extrinsic curvature and the intrinsic metric of the slices .",
    "question is how does one know that there is a apparent horizon in the slice ? there is a very general equation , which when satisfied shows the existence of a trapped surface .",
    "this is of the following form : _ a s^a + k_ab s^a s^b - k=0 where @xmath204 is a space - like vector , normal to the 2-surface .",
    "the above can be re - written in terms of the variable @xmath205 and the triads as : _ a s^a + k_a^ie_b^i s^a s^b - k_a^i e^a_i=0 for arbitrary value of the immirzi parameter , this equation will show a dependence on the parameter . here , as @xmath206 and @xmath207 , @xmath208 , the above equation in terms of the generelised variable assumes the form ( the christoffel connections which appear in the covariant derivative are independent of @xmath209 ) : _ a s^a +  ^k_a^i  ^e_b^i - 1 ^ 3/2  ^k_a^i  ^ e^a_i=0    now",
    ", we stay with the assumption that we are trying to re - build the schwarzschild black hole space - time from the coherent state , and hence , there is a set of spherically symmetric coordinates .",
    "the apparent horizon , is a sphere or @xmath210 , and one gets the following relation for the intrinsic metric measured , and the extrinsic metric of the same slice .",
    "( we resort to the classical variables or @xmath209=1 ) .",
    "- ^_r -^_r + k_rr - k_rr q^rr - k _ q^ - k _ q^=0 [ eq : app ] now , @xmath211 in the classical values cancel each other at @xmath212 leaving the following equation in the radial sector , which is trivially satisfied everywhere : k_rr",
    "( 1-q^rr)=0 thus clearly imposing the apparent horizon equation on the radial edges does not introduce any new constraints on the radial coherent state wavefunction .",
    "one can then think of the horizon as being formed by purely radial edges crossing the horizon , with the radial wavefunction corresponding to ` free wavefunctions ' as would be there for a spherically symmetric space time .",
    "while trying to lift the apparent horizon equation to an operator equation , we only retain the terms which constrain the angular sector of the theory . a crucial assumption which is included in the calculation is the fact that classical spatial slice has a flat spherically symmetric metric , and",
    "the horizon is a spherical surface in that spatial slice .",
    "the apparent horizon equation now only includes the derivatives of the angular metric forming a difference equation for the discretised variables along the angular edges .",
    "the equation is : -^_r - k_^i e^_i - ^_r - k^i _",
    "e^_i = 0 [ eq : app1 ] the @xmath213 the derivative is replaced by a difference in the discrete version of the same equation .",
    "the horizon , is thus now a set of radial edges , with a set of vertices @xmath214 outside the horizon , and a set of vertices @xmath215 inside the horizon .",
    "the derivatives are thus differences in the value of the metric at vertices @xmath214 , with their values which are at vertices @xmath215 .",
    "thus for a representative set of vertices , the difference equation is obtained by subtracting the value of @xmath216 at @xmath217 which is outside the horizon with the value of the inverse dreibein inside the horizon at vertex @xmath218 .",
    "the inverse dreibein is also expressed as a poisson bracket first and then lifted to an operator form .",
    "thus now    ^_r & = & e^_i e^_i 1r(v_1 ) - r(v_2)(e_^j(v_1 ) - e_^j(v_2))e_^j(v_1 ) + & = & + & & tr_v_1    further , one uses the observation that @xmath219 , where @xmath46 is the immirzi parameter , to write @xmath220 .",
    "this enables one to rewrite the apparent horizon equation interms of the holonomy operator , incorporating information of the extrinsic curvature . thus ^k_^i",

    "the derivative is of the form @xmath222 , and hence yields a exact answer for the derivative , introducing no further fuzziness in the equation for the location of the apparent horizon , for fine graphs .",

    "+ 2 ) the classical values of @xmath224 for the edges meeting at the vertex @xmath217 are correlated with the same for edges meeting at the vertex @xmath218 .",

    "+ 4)the volume operator at the vertex @xmath218 contains information about the horizon area @xmath225 , but we consider that as an independent variable , which can be changed , and the rest of the variables will change accordingly .",
    "this will imply a sum over all possible graphs interpretation for the entropy , which we also try to discuss at the end of this article . for a fixed @xmath225 , the above apparent horizon equation , gives the graph degrees of freedom inside the horizon as a function of those outside the horizon .",
    "these will reflect in a correlation between the wavefunctions inside and outside the horizon . to emphasise again ,",
    "the radial edges which cross the horizon remain completely free , with no restriction on them from the apparent horizon equation .",
    "clearly this results in a set of wavefunctions for the coherent state peaked at the edges which are correlated with each other .",
    "now , one has to ensure that this results in a entropy proportional to the area of the horizon .",
    "we show in the final density matrix calculation , it is the radial edges which constitute the ` entropy ' of the system by counting the number of ways to build the apparent horizon 2-surface area .    in more general terms , very crucial assumptions which went into the determination of equation ( [ eq : app1 ] ) to have a separation of the angular and radial components was the assumption that there are no cross terms in the extrinsic curvature , or @xmath226 even at the operator level .",
    "this can be ensured in terms of the gauge connection by the condition k_ab = ( ^i_a - a^i_a)e_ib = 0 , for ab and q^ab = e^a_i e^b_i=0 for ab ( which is the diagonalisation condition of the metric ) .",
    "however , these assumptions are not drastic , as any deviations from the above due to quantum fluctuations will be proportional to @xmath2 , and hence ignored in the correlators being considered here .",
    "thus , the apparent horizon is located by measurements in the angular coherent states , and the radial coherent states associated with the radial edges , induce the apparent horizon with area .",
    "now , we shall address the question why the degeneracy associated with the induction of the area of the horizon can be called the entropy of the black hole . hence , in the next section , we first review , how entropy arises from a density matrix , and then derive the density matrix associated with the coherent state wavefunction .",
    "the density matrix by definition for a given configuration in a state @xmath10 is of the following form : = |><| the expectation value of any operator can be evaluated in this matrix as : = tr(a ) = tr(a|><| ) = < |a| > the usefulness of the density matrix is particularly evident , when the system is in the product of two hilbert spaces , and one defines a reduced density matrix by tracing over one of them . as a illustration ,",
    "let the system be in the state : | > = _ i m d_im|i>|m > where the orthonormal states @xmath227 have a product structure , with @xmath228 and @xmath229 belonging to two different hilbert spaces .",

    "red ii = _ m d_im d^*_im and hence the condition which naturally arises is : tr(_red)=1 if there are no correlation between the hilbert spaces , in particular if the coefficients factorise as @xmath230 , then the resultant reduced system is still a pure system .",
    "this can be checked by the following condition : ^2 =  ,  ^2 <   as reported in the previous section , the coherent state for a black hole has precisely the same structure of product over hilbert spaces .",
    "now , is there a observer for whom only a part of the system is measurable ? at the classical level , ( one believes that the measuring instruments are classical ) , for an outside observer , the inside of a black hole does not exist .",
    "he / she does not receive any signal from inside the horizon .",
    "for such an observer , there has to be a reduced density matrix .",
    "however , as the coherent state is written in the covariant form , there appear no information of the continuity conditions which must be , imposed at the vertices .",
    "thus , the classical labels of different edges are not really independent , but must satisfy a continuity condition at a shared vertex .",
    "this introduces correlations even at the classical level .",
    "these continuity conditions must be imposed from einstein s equation . here",
    ", we discuss only the classical correlation introduced due to the apparent horizon equation .",
    "thus even at the classical level , and one can not integrate over the edges inside the horizon independently of the edges outside .",
    "there is also a method to quantify the relation .",
    "classically , we have defined the graph degrees of freedom for the black hole , as the holonomy and momentum along one - dimensional edges and corresponding dual surfaces .",
    "though , we have talked about recovering the ` classical action ' principle for these variables on the individual edges , we have yet to examine the continuity conditions at the vertices , since the classical metric itself is continuos throughout the manifold",
    ". these conditions will ensure the existence of correlations for the states defined on the entire manifold . at the level of the gauge invariant coherent state wavefunction , the gauss constraints are satisfied with the introduction of the clebsch gordon coefficients at the vertices .",
    "there is a discussion on the gauge invariant states in @xcite , and the peak behaviour of these states .",
    "however , we are mainly interested in quantifying the correlation at the vertices , and in the semiclassical limit .",
    "this limit is difficult to evaluate from the exact form of the coefficients .",
    "we shall discuss this eventually , but for the time being , we discuss the ` macroscopic correlations ' which are manifestations of the continuity of the classical metric , and at the horizon , the apparent horizon equation .    for the classical observer , who makes measurements in the schwarzschild",
    "coordinates @xmath231 , while confined to the slice @xmath232 slice , the spatial slice ceases to exist after the horizon . though the transformed discrete variables will be the same set of variables of the observer , as @xmath233 , but as he / she approaches the apparent horizon , for her / him , the coordinate time measured in @xmath2 will be running to infinity .",
    "( this is the same graph , same slicing , but measured in the coordinates of the outside observer , and not the @xmath234 frame . ) for the outside observer , the coherent state wavefunction inside the horizon is irrelevant information . he / she is forced to deal with a reduced density matrix instead .",
    "the expectation values of all operators for the outside observer pertain to the density matrix now .",
    "what does tracing over the ` inside edges ' mean ?",
    "the gauge - invariant wavefunctions are correlated at the vertices by the clebsch - gordon coefficients . and",
    "it is a difficult task to evaluate the exact nature of this correlation , and how the coefficients influence the peak of the entire coherent state .",
    "however , the fact that the elements @xmath98 themselves are classical solutions restrict the wavefunctions .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the apparent horizon equation clearly correlates the classical elements across the horizon .",
    "we now try to quantify the correlation across the horizon .",
    "let us take the set of radial edges which cross the horizon .",
    "these end at a set of vertices , and these vertices are the starting point of a set of edges , now inside the horizon . if the radial edges which cross the horizon induce the set of classical elements @xmath235 , then the areas induced by the edges inside the horizon also get determined from the apparent horizon equation .",
    "the apparently uncorrelated wavefunctions are now naturally correlated .",
    "let us take the specific coherent states which are peaked over the edges sharing a vertex , one inside the horizon , and one outside the horizon . for simplicity",
    ", we will be suppressing the azimuthal direction .",
    "the edges are @xmath236 , @xmath237 .",
    "where the first three share a vertex @xmath217 with the radial edge @xmath238 crossing the horizon , and the last three sharing vertex @xmath218 which is inside the horizon and end point of @xmath238 . to avoid overcounting of the edges sharing the vertex @xmath217 and @xmath218 , one takes the set of angular edges which are ingoing at a given vertex .",
    "the coherent state is thus a product of the coherent states for each of the above edges .",

    "now from the apparent horizon equation , classical values of @xmath241 , and hence the the wavefunctions can not be integrated as independent , for the different edges .",

    "@xmath242 denotes all the spins labelling the outside edges and @xmath243 denotes all the spin labels for the inside edges .",
    "the horizon wavefunction however is determined by the area @xmath225 for the horizon bit that the edge induces .",
    "infact , it is precisely the @xmath225 of the horizon edge which can be considered as a variable and adds to the entropy of the horizon .",
    "the form of the coherent state wavefunction remains the same as above , except that now the labels @xmath244 of the wavefunctions inside the horizon , are functions of those outside .",
    "the exact functional form will depend on the solution from the apparent horizon equation._moreover , even so , the correlation is difficult to quantify in a entropy calculation . to enable the entropy calculation to first order in the semi - classical parameter",
    ", we encode the correlation in a conditional probability function @xmath245 ,",
    "( n is a constant ) , when the values are as determined by the apparent horizon equation or is 0 otherwise . _",
    "given the formalism discussed in the paper , this is the only way one can introduce a correlation in the wave function .",
    "the ` classical correlation ' is encoded in the expectation value of the operators , and hence the labels @xmath69 .",
    "the functional form of the wavefunction and it s dependence on @xmath69 remains unchanged , as obtained from the coherent state transform .",
    "@xmath246 now includes the correlation function f. now clearly the above coherent state is written for the edges which are connected across the horizon by one horizon edge . in otherwords they share the vertex @xmath217 and @xmath218 which are the initial point and final point of the radial edge crossing the horizon .",
    "thus the density matrix constructed of the above state can now be written in the form : _",
    "v_1 , v_2=|(v_1,v_2)><(v_1,v_2)| the full density matrix for the entire horizon would comprise of = _",
    "v_1,v_2 |(v_1,v_2)><(v_1,v_2)| where the product is over all the vertices comprising the immediate outside and inside of the horizon .",

    "the reduced density matrix then has the following components ( following the same procedure as in equation([eq : trace ] ) ) : _",

    "( note @xmath248 for any of the edges outside , inside , or at the horizon indicates a peak value which equates to classical parameters . )",
    "the density matrix which is reduced now has the following form _",
    "v_1  j_\\{o } j_h j_\\{o } = e^-t j_\\{o}(j_\\{o } + 1)/2e^-t j_\\{o}(j_\\{o } + 1)/2 e^-t j_h(j_h+1 ) |f_j_\\{o},j_\\ { i cl}|^2 due to the @xmath249 in the denominator which contributes with a factor proportional to @xmath250 , the    ( note @xmath251 for any of suffixes for edge labels outside , inside , or at the horizon indicates a peak value which equates to classical parameters . )",
    "offdiagonal elements are all damped exponentially in the semi - classical regime where @xmath25 , and @xmath88 is very large . for the diagonal elements",
    "this factor is assimilated into a gaussian which becomes a delta function in the semiclassical limit .",
    "infact as determined in @xcite , this implies e^-t j(j + 1 ) ~e^-j2 e^-j2 e^- [ eq : prob ] the interesting aspect of this is that when the semiclassical parameter @xmath25 , the functions in ( [ eq : prob ] ) tend to delta functions , each peaked at appropriate values of the classical variables .",
    "thus , the ` density matrix ' reduces to a set of delta functions : _ v_1 j_\\{o } j_h , j_\\{o } j_h = ( j_\\{o}t , p_\\{o})(m_\\{o}t , p^i_\\{o } ) ( j_h t , p_h)(m_h t p^i_h ) |f_j_\\{o},j _ i cl    matrix elements , as determined by the delta function equations .",
    "the non - zero elements are @xmath252 , however , the @xmath253 . at the horizon",
    "only @xmath225 is fixed , and hence the entire range of @xmath254 is allowed .",
    "this is the origin of the degeneracy of the density matrix , and the entropy of the entire space - time .",
    "after all the discussion on the coherent states and the density matrices , the entropy is finally the number of ways to build the horizon area .",
    "inclusion of all the edges comprising the entire graph in the initial density matrix would not contribute to the entropy , as they would belong to tensor product of hilbert spaces , and give unit norms in the trace .",
    "however , one must emphasise that this is a ` semi - classical ' result , valid at 0th order in the semi - classical parameter @xmath2 .",
    "if one includes the higher order corrections , one would get a ` quantum entropy ' and the importance of the above result for an explicit expression for the density matrix is in the obtaining of the corrections to black hole entropy . from ( [ eq : den ] ) , and @xmath255 , it follows that @xmath256 .",
    "this apparently ` trivial ' factor @xmath257 still has non - trivial information about the classical correlations , as now @xmath258 and @xmath259 are determined by the classical labels of the edges at the vertex @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "hence , if the @xmath258 and @xmath259 were anything other than those determined by the apparent horizon equation , then @xmath257 would be zero .",
    "now the full density matrix will be a product of all the density matrices of the vertices immediately outside the horizon .",
    "thus the entropy would be : s_bh=",
    "-tr[]= -tr[_v _ v ( _ v _ v)]= _ v ( 2 j_v + 1 )    the additional constraint is ( j_v + 12)t =  or ( j_v + 12)= in case all the area bits are set as equal @xmath260 , one obtains , n(j_s + 12)=    and entropy s_bh= ( 2 j_s + 1 )    this obviously differs from the bekenstein hawking entropy due to the dependence on spin .",
    "we will subsequently discuss the immirzi parameter which will be adjusted to give the appropriate entropy .",
    "in the previous discussion , the entropy is shown to arise due to the degeneracy associated with the number of ways of inducing horizon area , given a graph .",
    "the graph is such that only radial edges cross the given horizon .",
    "now , this assumption can be somewhat generalised to include a sum over all possible similar graphs , which would imply a difference in the number of edges crossing the horizon .",
    "this then would include a sum over all possible areas induced by a horizon edge , though the entire formalism of the previous section would remain absolutely same .",
    "the coherent state formalism is useful is studying this sum over all possible @xmath225 for the reason , that , there exists a liouville measure in the classical phase space , with respect to which the states are overcomplete .",
    "now , when the density matrix for a particular set of vertices is defined as _ v_1 v_2=    the correlated wavefunction @xmath261 at a particular value , as all the classical labels are determined .",
    "however , if now one chooses to integrate over all possible areas induced at the horizon , then , the classical labels for the @xmath262 and @xmath263 are also going to change accordingly . to quantify the above , one can thus write the conditional probability as now a function of @xmath225 , with a @xmath264 , if the classical labels are as obtained from the apparent horizon equation , or zero otherwise . once the density matrix is obtained ,",
    "then the diagonal terms give the probability of finding the system in that state , given any internal state .",
    "now , this probability function is multiplied by the ` overlap function ' or the probability @xmath265 , with respect to the liouville measure .",
    "the probability function gives the probability of finding the system at the phase space point @xmath266 , when it is in a state @xmath267 .",
    "p^t(g_h , g_h)d= p^t(g_h , g_h)e^-p_h^2/t e^-t/4 d^3 p_h d_h    where @xmath268 is the haar measure .",
    "now , finally , the probability and the correlation function are independent of the holonomy , and so , the haar measure integrates out to 1 . also , in the @xmath269 limit , the ovelap function is almost 1 .",
    "thus , one retaines now only the liouville measure in the variable @xmath225 .",
    "now the measure @xmath270 can be converted to @xmath271 , where the angles @xmath272 and @xmath273 are in the internal 3 space .",
    "integration over the angles would achieve a averaging over the components of the momentum , with it s length as fixed .",

    "the value of @xmath225 should vary from 0 to @xmath282 , depending on the number of edges crossing the horizon ( increase in number of edges decreases the value of @xmath225 ) .",
    "also , due to the presence of the @xmath283 term in the measure , the maximum value of the density matrix elements are concentrated around @xmath284 . in the regime where @xmath285 , the @xmath286 term in the sum dominates , and the sum trivially reduces to 1 .",
    "this concentration of the possible horizon area elements near a @xmath287 value is in agreement with previous derivation of black hole entropy as arising from @xmath288 spin elements , albeit in different formalisms @xcite .",
    "the density matrix elements then are of the form : _ jj = |f|^2 setting @xmath289 , one obtaines @xmath290 , and hence the correct value of entropy is recovered .",
    "this limit is in the situation where the number of edges crossing the horizon are large , and quite opposite to the regime discussed in the previous fixed graph calculation .",
    "however , in both the regimes the same entropy law , proportional to area of the horizon is recovered .",
    "further , in this regime , the offdiagonal elements of the density matrix will also be non - zero , and provide corrections terms to the entropy .",
    "this factor prevents the above entropy counting from being the exact bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "however , what has been excluded from the above is the fact that the area spectrum is @xmath291 , for different quantisation sectors of the theory . since the constraint is @xmath292 , where @xmath293 is the classical area of horizon , which remains unchanged for the immirzi parameter related variables .",
    "n=(2 j_s + 1 )    thus it seems that if @xmath294 would be the correct choice for the immirzi parameter .",
    "however , this is rather dependent on the choice of graph , and the area it induces on the horizon . in the most general situation",
    ", this would include a sum over all possible graphs , and the coefficient of the counting would equate the value of the immirzi parameter . here",
    "the counting would be different from that given in @xcite and hence the value of the immirzi parameter would be considerably different , from the prediction there .",
    "here we summarise the results in the previous sections for the entropy of the schwarzschild black hole , and show how they can be easily extended to include spherically symmetric apparent horizons .",
    "the key assumption of the entire article has been that the classical spatial slice , at which the solution is peaked has spherical symmetry . in otherwords , the metric on the spatial slice has the form ds^2= dr^2 + r^2 dthis also presumes that the intrinsic metric is flat .",
    "the information about the curvature of the entire slice is contained in @xmath45 or the extrinsic curvature for the entire slice .",
    "the presence of the apparent horizon equation is obtained as a solution of the equation -^_r - ^_r + k_^i e^_i",
    "+ k_^i e^_i=0 where @xmath295 , @xmath296 are arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate . as before the graph",
    "is taken along the radial , and angular coordinate lines , forming discrete lines .",
    "the classical space is thus sampled in terms of discrete variables @xmath297 , which are then combined to form the classical label on which the coherent states are peaked .",
    "since the apparent horizon equation places no conditions on the radial edges , a similar construction is done , where horizon areas are induced only by the radial edges .",
    "the apparent horizon equation then is a difference equation linking the vertices which the radial edges connect .",
    "the coherent states are then correlated across the vertices .",
    "the density matrix and the subsequent derivation of entropy thus follows automatically .",
    "this would imply e.g. , any spherically symmetric apparent horizon will have entropy proportional to the area of the horizon , this would then automatically include cosmological horizons , also .",
    "the addition of a cosmological term in the lagrangian does not change the definition of the kinematical variables of the theory , and hence all the discussions in the previous sections of the coherent states does not change the derivation of entropy .",
    "in this paper , the main aspects of black hole physics emphasised are :    1)black holes are classical solutions of einstein s equations and hence would correspond to a semi - classical state like the coherent state in a quantum theory .",
    "+ 2)in a exact quantisation of the theory , it is difficult to identify a complete ` black hole ' state , though , states with trapped surfaces in reduced phase space quantisations have been obtained in @xcite , and also the isolated horizon boundary condition basically identifies the horizon by imposing the boundary condition on the physical states of the theory .",
    "+ 3 ) the coherent states defined in @xcite on the other hand provide a complete formalism for the state which would correspond to a given black hole solution .",
    "+ 4)the given coherent state which is peaked in both the momentum and configuration space variable is also a state where both the ` area ' ( intrinsic metric ) and the extrinsic curvature ( holonomy ) can be measured with minimum uncertainty .",
    "+ 5)thus the measurements in the coherent state allows one to build a entire spatial slice of the given space - time , and hence locate the apparent horizon and the singularity uniquely .",
    "+ 6)the information about the space - time is however encoded in regularised variables of the holonomy defined along one dimensional edges of finite length , and corresponding momentum induced on dual surfaces of the edges .",
    "this regularisation in case of a singularity at one point effectively regularises the same .",
    "the holonomy which has information about the curvature never diverges and takes oscillatory values from -1 .. 1 .",
    "+ 7)a clear uncertainty principle prevents measurement of area zero , and hence , the singularity in the curvature operator is resolved mainly due to the existence of a minimal area .",
    "+ 8)the coherent state is a tensor product of coherent states over edges , and hence one can trace over the edges inside the horizon .",
    "+ 9)to encode the correlation of the classical variables across the horizon , one finds that the apparent horizon equation is a function of the variables outside the horizon , as well as those inside the horizon .",
    "+ 10)the wavefunctions which are functions of the classical labels are thus correlated , and lead to a entropy of the resultant density matrix obtained after tracing the wavefunction inside the horizon .",
    "it shall be very interesting to calculate the corrections to entropy , and whether they have a logarithmic behaviour as calculated in @xcite .",
    "+ there are quite a few questions still to be completely understood .",
    "+ 1 ) what exactly happens for a general spatial slicing , i.e. those without the flatness assumption ? + 2)are there more coherent states than the ones stated here , and what would the expectation values of operators in those states be ? + for immediate future problems : + 1)the above formalism can be generalised to arbitrary black holes , those with charge and angular momentum .",
    "+ 2)the regularised curvature operator in terms of holonomy and momenta can be measured in other states , not necessarily semiclassical .",
    "+ 3)the semiclassical derivations of black hole thermodynamics here can be used to obtain a approximate temperature using the density matrix , and a evolution in time .",
    "this is work in progress .",
    "+ to summarise , the semi - classical nature of black holes have been discussed .",
    "the quantisation , is non - perturbative , and includes the full degrees of freedom for gravity",
    ". it will be interesting to verify the hamiltonian constraint completely for the coherent states , right now the action of the hamiltonian on these states leads to states of very small norm .",
    "there is a discretisation of the schwarzschild space - time using dynamical triangulation techniques in @xcite , it shall be interesting to obtain the entropy in that formalism .",
