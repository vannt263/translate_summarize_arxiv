    "as a result of breakthroughs in biotechnology and high - throughput experiments thousands of regulatory and protein - protein interactions have been revealed and genome - wide protein - protein interaction ( ppi ) data are now available .",
    "protein - protein interactions are one of the most important components of biological networks as they are fundamental to the functioning of cells . to gain a better understanding of why these interactions take place , it is necessary to view them from an evolutionary perspective .",
    "the evolutionary history of ppi networks can help answer many questions about how present - day networks have evolved and provide valuable insight into molecular mechanisms of network growth @xcite .",
    "however , inferring network evolution history is a statistical and computational challenging problem as ppi networks of extant organisms provide only snapshots in time of the network evolution .",
    "there has been recent work on reconstructing ancestral interactions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the main growth mechanism of ppi network is gene duplication and divergence ( mutations ) @xcite : all proteins in a family evolve from a common ancestor through gene duplications and mutations and the protein network reflects the entire history of the genome evolution @xcite . in this paper",
    "we follow @xcite and we develop computational methods to infer the growth history and the parameters under the given model incorporating not only the topology of observed networks , but also the duplication history of the proteins contained in the networks . in their article",
    "@xcite propose a maximum likelihood approach .",
    "the authors establish a neat representation of the likelihood function and it is this representation which is used in this article .",
    "the duplication history of the proteins can be inferred independently by phylogenetic analysis @xcite .",
    "the approach we adopt here is first to obtain a numerically stable estimate of the likelihood function , under fixed parameters ; this achieved via the sequential monte carlo ( smc ) method ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this approach can then be used to infer the parameters of the model , from a bayesian perspective , as well as the growth history , via a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this has not been considered in the literature , although related ideas have appeared for simpler models in @xcite .",
    "our computational strategy not only improves on likelihood estimation in comparison to @xcite , but also provides a natural setup to perform posterior inference on the parameters of interest .",
    "this article is structured as follows . in section [ sec : modelsandmethods ] we detail the model and associated computational method for statistical inference . in section [ sec : results ] our numerical results are presented . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "the article is concluded with some discussion of future work .",
    "we follow similar notation and exposition as in @xcite to introduce the protein - protein interaction network , its duplication history , and the duplication - mutation with complementarity ( dmc ) model @xcite . in particular , the notions of adjacency and duplication are made concrete there .",
    "we also introduce the associated bayesian inference problem with which this work is primarily concerned ( i.e. , that of inferring the parameters of the dmc model ) .",
    "we then describe a particle marginal metropolis - hastings ( pmmh ) algorithm @xcite that can be used to perform such inference .",
    "consider an undirected graph @xmath0 without multiple edges and self - loops , where the nodes represent proteins and the edges represent interactions between those proteins .",
    "such a graph is called a ppi network , and as in @xcite , we denote the vertex set by @xmath5 , the edge set by @xmath6 , and the number of nodes in @xmath0 by @xmath7 .",
    "all nodes which are adjacent to a node @xmath8 ( not including @xmath8 itself ) comprise the neighbourhood of @xmath8 , and that neighbourhood is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 evolved from a seed graph @xmath1 via a series of duplication , mutation , and homodimerization steps under a dmc model . under the dmc model , at each time step @xmath10 , the graph @xmath11 evolves from @xmath12 by the following processes in order :    1 .",
    "the anchor node @xmath13 is chosen uniformly at random from @xmath14 , and a duplicate node @xmath15 is added to @xmath12 and connected to every member of @xmath16 .",
    "this is the duplication step , and it yields an intermediary graph denoted @xmath17 .",
    "2 .   for each @xmath18 , we uniformly choose one of the two edges in @xmath19 at random and delete it with probability @xmath20 .",
    "this is the mutation step , and the parameter @xmath21 is henceforth referred to as the mutation parameter .",
    "the anchor node @xmath13 and the duplicate node @xmath15 are connected with probability @xmath22 to finally obtain @xmath11 .",
    "this is the homodimerization step , and the parameter @xmath22 is henceforth known as the homodimerization parameter .",
    "the dmc model is markovian , and we denote the transition density at time @xmath10 ( which encompasses the three afore - mentioned steps ) by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 . if we assign to a seed graph some prior density @xmath25 , then the density of the observed graph @xmath0 will be @xmath26,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 denotes the collection of growth histories . in this work , a seed graph will always be the graph consisting of two connected nodes ; thus , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "note that we are summing over all possible growth histories by which @xmath0 can evolve from a seed graph .",
    "also note that a growth history @xmath32 induces a unique sequence of duplicate nodes , @xmath33 @xcite .      in practice",
    ", one will not have access to the parameters @xmath34 and they must be inferred given @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in the bayesian setting , our objective is to consider the posterior density @xmath35 where @xmath36 is some proper prior for @xmath34 that we assume can easily be computed ( at least pointwise up to a normalising constant ) .",
    "the total number of growth histories grows exponentially with @xmath37 @xcite , and so any computations involving , and thus , ( e.g.  the evaluation of @xmath38 ) could potentially become very expensive . in the following sections",
    ", we reformulate the inference problem in the same manner as in @xcite to alleviate this issue .      as in @xcite , let @xmath2 be a binary forest , i.e.  a collection of rooted binary trees .",
    "the authors of @xcite describe a scheme that encodes the duplication history of a growth history @xmath32 within a series of duplication forests , @xmath39 , where each forest @xmath40 corresponds to a graph @xmath11 .",
    "we describe that scheme here .",
    "consider a trivial forest @xmath41 , whose only two isolated trees each consist of a single node .",
    "each of those isolated nodes will correspond to a node within the seed graph @xmath1 . to build @xmath42 from @xmath41 ,",
    "one replaces an anchor node @xmath43 from @xmath41 with a subtree , @xmath44 , consisting of two leaves ( @xmath45 is the duplicate node included @xmath46 but not @xmath1 ) .",
    "this process continues until one builds the series of forests @xmath47 to correspond to @xmath32 .    as highlighted in @xcite , the duplication forest @xmath2 ( corresponding to @xmath0 ) is uniquely determined by @xmath32 and a list of anchor nodes , @xmath48 .",
    "the important thing to emphasize here , is that given the duplication forest @xmath2 and @xmath0 , one now only needs to infer the duplication nodes sequence @xmath49 to reconstruct the complete growth history @xmath32 . for instance , at the first step backwards , knowledge of @xmath50 together with @xmath51 uniquely identifies the anchor node @xmath52 , thus one can reconstruct @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; this is then repeated for the remaining backward steps . thus , given @xmath55 , one can construct the growth history @xmath32 backward - in - time using the backward operators defined in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.4 ) , which construct @xmath56 deterministically given @xmath57 , for @xmath58 .     and",
    "@xmath59 . ]",
    "now suppose that in addition to @xmath0 , a practitioner is given @xmath2 corresponding to @xmath0 .",
    "our new objective  and the primary inference problem with which this work is concerned  is to consider the posterior density @xmath60 .",
    "notice that we have the joint distribution : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a sequence of duplication nodes compatible with the observed @xmath63 , and @xmath64 the corresponding reconstructed history .",
    "we are thus interested in the parameter posterior : @xmath65 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the density @xmath66 is typically a trivial term which could be ignored in practice . as the duplication forest @xmath2 limits the number of allowable anchor - and - duplicate node pairs , one can see that the number of possible growth histories is reduced .",
    "we will now present an smc algorithm that can sample the latent growth histories from the dmc model given the fixed parameters @xmath67 .",
    "we then show that this algorithm can be employed within a pmmh algorithm , as in @xcite , to sample from the posterior and infer @xmath68 ( and even @xmath69 ) .",
    "an smc algorithm simulates a collection of @xmath70 samples ( or , particles ) sequentially along the index @xmath10 via importance sampling and resampling techniques to approximate a sequence of probability distributions of increasing state - space , which are known pointwise up to their normalising constants . in this work ,",
    "we use the smc methodology to sample from the posterior distribution of the latent duplication history : @xmath71 backwards along the index @xmath10 via algorithm [ alg : smc ] in the appendix .",
    "the technique provides an unbiased estimate of the normalising constant ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.4.2 ) , @xmath72 : @xmath73,\\ ] ] where each @xmath74 is an un - normalised importance weight computed in algorithm [ alg : smc ] .",
    "note that under assumptions on the model , if @xmath75 for some @xmath76 , then the relative variance of the estimate is @xmath77 ; see @xcite .",
    "it is remarked that , as in @xcite , one could also use the discrete particle filter @xcite , with a possible improvement over the smc method detailed in algorithm  [ alg : smc ] ; see @xcite for some details .",
    "this smc can be employed within a pmmh algorithm to target the posterior of @xmath68 in .",
    "one can think of the deduced method as an mcmc algorithm running on the marginal @xmath68-space , but with the smc unbiased estimate @xmath78 replacing the unknown likelihood @xmath78 .",
    "more analytically , we can consider all random variables involved in the method and write down the equilibrium distribution in the enlarged state space , with @xmath68-marginal the target posterior @xmath79 .",
    "following @xcite and letting @xmath80 denote a sample @xmath81 at time @xmath10 , the extended equilibrium distribution is written as : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the probability of all the variables associated to algorithm [ alg : smc ] , with @xmath84 and the @xmath85 s being the simulated variables at each step of algorithm [ alg : smc ] .    a pmmh algorithm ( see algorithm [ alg : pmmh ] ) samples from , and one can remove the auxiliary variables from the samples to obtain draws for the parameters from . furthermore , one could even save the sampled growth histories with particle index @xmath86 to obtain draws from the joint posterior @xmath87 .",
    "however , in this work , we are primarily interested in the inference of @xmath68 .",
    "the variance of the estimate plays a crucial role in the performance of algorithm [ alg : pmmh ] , as is used to compute the acceptance probability within the pmmh algorithm .",
    "thus , we first tested the variability of as computed by algorithm [ alg : smc ] to understand how the variance changes with @xmath7 .",
    "we then ran algorithm [ alg : pmmh ] to sample from the posterior and infer @xmath68 for a given pair of observations @xmath88 .",
    "we present the details of those experiments below .",
    "we simulated a graph @xmath0 and a forest @xmath2 from the dmc model @xcite with the parameters set as @xmath90 , where @xmath91 .",
    "we saved each pair @xmath92 for @xmath93 , and we ran algorithm [ alg : smc ] fifty times per pair ( with @xmath94 ) to compute fifty unbiased estimates of @xmath95 for @xmath93 .",
    "in the top of figure [ fig : smctest ] in section [ sec : figures ] , we plot the relative variance of the estimate ( or , the variance divided by the square of the expected value ) per each value of @xmath96 .",
    "we repeated the experiment two more times , with @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and the associated output is also presented in figure [ fig : smctest ] .",
    "as remarked above , if @xmath75 for some @xmath76 , then the relative variance of @xmath99 is @xmath77 .",
    "figure [ fig : smctest ] confirms that the variance increases linearly and that increasing the value of @xmath70 with @xmath7 ( at least linearly ) will help to control the variance .",
    "however , the plots show that the relative variance is still high , which means that @xmath70 will have to be large to ensure satisfactory performance of the pmmh in practice",
    ".      we separately simulated a graph @xmath0 and a forest @xmath2 from the dmc model with the parameters again set as @xmath90 , and we set @xmath100 . given only @xmath88 , we inferred @xmath34 with each parameter having a uniform prior on the interval @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "we set the number of particles within algorithm [ alg : smc ] to be @xmath102 , and we ran the pmmh algorithm to obtain 10,000 samples from the extended target .",
    "figure [ fig : simdata ] in section [ sec : figures ] illustrates good mixing of the pmmh algorithm and accurate inference of the parameters @xmath34 .",
    "the trace plots show that the algorithm is not sticky , and the autocorrelation functions give evidence to an approximate independence between samples .",
    "the posterior densities are also interesting , in that they are clearly different from the uniform priors and they show that the pmmh algorithm spends a majority of the computational time sampling the true parameter values .",
    "we have introduced a bayesian inferential framework for the dmc model @xcite , where , as in @xcite , one assumes the pair @xmath88 is observed and the parameters @xmath34 are unknown .",
    "we then described how an smc algorithm can be used to simulate growth histories and ultimately be employed within pmmh to target the posterior distribution of the parameters , thereby opening up the possibility of performing bayesian inference on the dmc model .",
    "numerical tests demonstrated that algorithm [ alg : smc ] can have a high variability when @xmath7 is large and @xmath70 is not sufficiently high , and this limits the scope of the inference problem which can be tackled using the complete algorithm [ alg : pmmh ] .",
    "however , the proposals used in the example experiments within algorithms [ alg : smc ] and [ alg : pmmh ] are naive , as the method simply chooses a candidate duplicate node @xmath103 at random from all permitted nodes given the current @xmath104 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that more sophisticated proposal densities could reduce the variance of the smc and/or improve the mixing of the pmmh , thereby allowing one to perform inference when @xmath96 is large and @xmath70 is smaller .",
    "this could be explored in a future work .",
