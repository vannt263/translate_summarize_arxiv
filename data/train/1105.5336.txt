    ", localization properties of the dirac eigenmodes have attracted attention as they can be used to draw analogies to condensed matter phenomena : concepts like the mobility edge and anderson localization can be studied in qcd lattice simulations . in this spirit",
    "the chiral transition at finite temperature has been conjectured to be an anderson ( metal - insulator ) transition .",
    "this goes hand in hand with different random matrix theory ( rmt ) descriptions of the dirac spectra . in the low temperature phase ,",
    "the existence of the chiral condensate connects qcd to chiral perturbation theory and random matrix theory ( becoming exact in the epsilon - regime ) , which explains the statistics of the low lying part of the dirac spectrum @xcite .",
    "the spectral gap in the high temperature phase , on the other hand , seems to call for the `` soft edge '' description of rmt , which , however , could not be supported by lattice data @xcite .",
    "instead , a transition to independent eigenmodes obeying poisson statistics has been suggested @xcite .",
    "a refined analysis by one of us has shown , that the bulk of the spectrum is still delocalized and subject to rmt , while the lowest lying eigenmodes display a transition to localization and poissonian behavior of the eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "this effect has been confirmed to be universal in the sense that it does not depend on the resolution of the lattice .",

    "@xcite found that localization is essentially a finite volume artifact .",
    "however , they used a different , less restrictive definition of localization and thus their results are not in conflict with the rest of the above cited literature .",
    "in this work we give another crucial ingredient of anderson localization in qcd , namely we identify the `` defects '' causing it .",
    "we show that at high temperature local polyakov loop fluctuations trap low - lying modes .",
    "the average polyakov loop as an order parameter of the deconfinement ( or center ) phase transition approaches 1 with increasing temperature .",
    "locally , however , the polyakov loop takes on other values , in particular close to other center elements , @xmath1 in the case of gauge group @xmath0 .",
    "the phase transition can actually be viewed as a percolation of the physical sector embracing such islands where the polyakov loop is close to other center elements @xcite .",
    "the locations of these polyakov loop fluctuations ( which are similar to weiss domains in ferromagnetism ) are correlated with maxima in the profile of low - lying dirac modes .",

    "our present study is , however , the first one when similarity of staggered and overlap dirac eigen_modes _ is seen in lattice simulations and we consider this an important side result of our study .    the observed localization can be understood via polyakov loops compensating the twist caused by the antiperiodic boundary conditions in the temporal direction .",
    "the corresponding matsubara frequency is effectively lowered ( locally ) which results in lower eigenvalues .",
    "actually , our finding has been inspired by a similar localization effect in the spectrum of the gauge - covariant laplace operator @xcite .",

    "otherwise this operator does not share important chiral features like topological zero modes and condensates .    likewise ,",
    "our finding is consistent with the existence of a chiral condensate in the polyakov loop sector close to other center elements @xcite ( also needed for center symmetry breaking @xcite ) , which implies low dirac eigenvalues in islands of such polyakov loops .",
    "the connection of these islands to topological excitations like magnetic monopoles is attractive , but in its naive form contradicts the observed topological susceptibility quantitatively , see below .    for the construction of random matrix models valid at high temperature",
    "we investigate the distribution of local polyakov loops and find them to be uncorrelated to a good approximation .",
    "hence , polyakov loops in fact provide the poissonian ingredient for the dirac spectrum .",
    "this is built into a novel anderson - like random matrix model through supplementing it by random matrix entries that represent nearest neighbor hoppings in three - dimensional space .",
    "we motivate this model and show , that with a few parameters it reproduces the main features of the dirac modes : chirality , spectral gap , rmt - poisson transition and localization ( to the analogue of local polyakov loops ) .",

    "the gaussian rmt ensembles provide predictions for it , which also apply to systems with chiral symmetry , depending only on the universality class . for gauge group @xmath0 the latter are the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) for the overlap operator ( like for the continuum dirac operator ) and the gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) for the staggered operator .",

    "at least a few independently ( poissonian ) distributed eigenvalues are needed on each configuration .",
    "since independent modes occur only at the very low end of the spectrum where the spectral density is low , large enough volumes are required for that . in @xcite",
    "also the independence of these data of the lattice spacing has been demonstrated for the staggered case .",
    "the properties of the independent and localized modes at the lower ends of the spectra are the main subject of the rest of the paper .",

    "it is clear that a wave - like mode @xmath33 with approximately constant amplitude yields an @xmath34 close to the average polyakov loop @xmath35 , whereas a strongly localized mode picks the polyakov loop in that region .",
    "if the latter happens to be an island of `` wrong '' polyakov loops , @xmath34 tends to zero or even becomes negative .",
    "[ fig polloop modes one ] shows the ratio of @xmath34 averaged over different configurations and the average polyakov loop , both for the low - lying overlap and low - lying staggered modes .",

    "higher modes , on the contrary , tend to see the average polyakov loop .     from ( [ eqn new probability ] ) , in the @xmath15 sector compared to the polyakov loop distribution and the haar measure ( valid in the low temperature phase ) . ]",

    "the quantum numbers @xmath46 are governed by a combination of the antiperiodic temporal boundary condition for fermions and the polyakov loop phase , namely @xmath47 , where the different signs emerge from the different color components , see ( [ eqn polloop phase first ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the free dirac operator are these numbers multiplied by the temperature .",
    "the lowest ones , @xmath48 we name _ effective matsubara frequencies_. these hold in the limit @xmath49 , whereas on the lattice one has @xmath50    at high temperatures the polyakov loop ( at fixed lattice spacing ) becomes trivial , @xmath51 , hence @xmath52 and the matsubara frequency is @xmath53 .",
    "a more realistic estimate is obtained by using the average polyakov loop at our temperature @xmath54 , from which we obtain the effective matsubara frequency in lattice units ( @xmath55 ) as @xmath56 which is the same order of magnitude as the lower end of the bulk of eigenvalues we measured ( consistent with the findings of @xcite ) .",
    "the main point of these considerations is that `` wrong '' polyakov loops , @xmath57 with @xmath58 , would lead to a vanishing effective matsubara frequency , @xmath59 , and thus to the lowest dirac eigenvalues .",
    "of course , in realistic configurations one has to take into account that the polyakov loop varies in space and that nontrivial spatial links are present .",
    "both will change the dirac eigenvalues away from the free ones .",
    "nonetheless , the tendency that `` wrong '' polyakov loops give rise to smaller eigenvalues persists and explains our finding about their pinning nature .",
    "topological excitations of the gauge field and their zero modes are an attractive hypothesis to explain low - lying dirac modes in yang - mills theory ( and qcd ) . the chiral condensate at zero temperature is thought of as due to instantons of realistic size and density and the first conjecture about the metal - insulator transition at finite temperature was based on instanton ensembles @xcite .",
    "the natural topological excitations at finite temperature are magnetic monopoles .",
    "they appear as selfdual or antiselfdual solutions of the yang - mills equations of motion at finite temperature . as they are also electrically charged , they are called dyons .",
    "dyons can be constituents of calorons ( finite temperature instantons ) @xcite , but may exist in isolation as well @xcite .    in gauge group @xmath0 , there are two dyons ( and two antidyons ) with opposite magnetic charge .",
    "one sort of these dyons is characterized by properties that exactly match our findings : the polyakov loop at their core is @xmath1 and they possess zero modes with the physical antiperiodic boundary conditions @xcite ( just like the constant configurations discussed above ) .",
    "the other sort has polyakov loop @xmath60 or @xmath61 by definition . ] and zero modes with periodic boundary conditions .    in dilute ensembles of dyons most of the zero modes",
    "should remain low - lying modes .",
    "then the first sort of dyons could explain the localized modes we analyzed , while the second sort could be responsible for low - lying periodic modes . at a positive average polyakov loop one",
    "expects fluctuations to @xmath1 much less frequent than those to @xmath60 , cf .",
    "[ fig polloop properties ]",
    ". hence the first sort of dyons could give independent low - lying modes , while the second sort could yield a condensate at periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this different appearance can be made quantitative by the different fractions of unit topological charge the two dyon sorts have , which are such that the @xmath1 dyons are indeed heavier as they have a larger ( classical ) action , see @xcite for lattice evidence of this picture and @xcite for a simple model .    from the relation of magnetic monopoles to both low - lying modes and topological charge a crucial test of this picture is to compare these two quantities at given temperature and volume . above the finite temperature transition fluctuations of the topological charge decrease sharply .",
    "this can be clearly seen by looking at how the topological susceptibility decreases at higher temperatures . as a result , at high temperature ,",
    "topological objects presumably form a dilute gas of non - interacting objects . from the index of the overlap dirac operator we have full information about the fluctuations of the _ total topological charge_. assuming that in the dilute gas topological objects are uncorrelated , this can be used to compute the density of topological objects that in turn can be compared to the density of localized poissonian dirac eigenmodes .    in table",
    "[ tab : charge_distribution ] we show the probability of different topological sectors extracted from the index of the overlap dirac operator . from the low occurrence of the topological charge sector @xmath62 and in particular of the sector",
    "@xmath63 it is indeed clear that topological objects form a very dilute gas . in these volumes",
    "it very rarely happens that there is more than one topological object on any given configuration .",
    "since we need only an order of magnitude estimate of the density of topological objects we will ignore the probability of two or more objects occurring on any single configuration . in this approximation",
    "we can shortcut the calculation of the density of topological objects , and the average number of topological objects per configuration is just given by the probability of the @xmath16 sector .",
    "on our volumes it is between @xmath64 and @xmath65 which is clearly far too small to account for the few localized poissonian modes we found on average per configuration .",
    "this comparison rules out models based on uncorrelated gluonic objects that carry both ( o(1 ) ) topological charge and ( antiperiodic ) zero modes .",

    "this model shows the desired transition in between parts of its spectrum with different eigenvalue density , however , the interpolating spacing distributions are different from the ones in the spectrum of the staggered operator @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation is the sparseness of this operator and the spatial information that is contained in the next - neighbor interactions .",
    "in contrast , the full matrices from the gaussian ensembles blindly connect all diagonal elements with equal strength .",
    "we construct a better suited random matrix model , based on sparse matrices , in the following .",
    "this model can be nicely motivated by our previous findings . concerning the polyakov loop , which will be connected to a random potential , three properties are relevant : ( i ) the distribution of local polyakov loops extends to negative values and thus small effective matsubara frequencies , cf .

    "are distributed according to a poissonian distribution .",
    "the last two properties are depicted in [ fig polloop properties ] .",
    "hence the polyakov loops could provide the poissonian ingredient for the statistics of the dirac eigenvalues . to become more concrete ,",

    "we split this operator in the temporal and spatial part @xmath73 @xmath74 contains the hopping terms in the temporal direction , whereas spatial hoppings are included in @xmath75 .",
    "the temporal part has a block - diagonal structure , with one block for each spatial site .",
    "we want to approximate each block and thus the whole dirac operator by restricting it to the subspace of the smallest eigenvalue quadruplet of the temporal operator at each spatial lattice site .",
    "the quadruplet consists of two eigenvalue pairs with opposite sign .",
    "the plus - minus degeneracy is necessary to conserve chiral symmetry , whereas the exact two - fold degeneracy has to be kept in order to have the right rmt universality class we find in the su(2 ) staggered spectra .",
    "in this basis , the temporal part of the dirac operator can be brought in the form @xmath76 with @xmath77 which resemble the effective matsubara frequencies on the lattice , as given in ( [ eqn eff mf latt ] ) , however as a function of the local rather than averaged polyakov loop phase @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , @xmath79 is a diagonal matrix with very weakly coupled entries , as argued above . physically speaking ,",
    "the temporal part represents a ( chiral ) random potential .",

    "its most important feature , however , seems to be the tail towards the `` trapping '' @xmath96 ( negative polyakov loop locally ) , since we have observed that most of the features of the model persist when using the haar measure @xmath97 as distribution [ not shown ] .    for the spatial part , one first of all needs to fix the periodicity of the underlying space , i.e. an integer @xmath98 such that @xmath99 is identified with @xmath100 , with unit vectors @xmath101 in each of the spatial directions .",

    "we have measured the ratio of the average determinants of the empirical quaternionic hopping terms finding @xmath111 and took this ratio over for the ratio of @xmath112 .",
    "the remaining ratio @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) was put in by hand to obtain desired properties of the rmt model , namely a gap at zero and a transition between a poissonian and a gse spacing distribution .    the eigenvalue density and spacing distribution of this model",
    "are plotted in [ sparsermtspacfigure ] for a spatial extent @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "we observe a similar transition like in the spectrum of the staggered dirac operator .",
    "another feature that this model shares with the staggered operator is the increasing localization of eigenmodes as the corresponding eigenvalues decrease , quantified by the ipr s in [ sparsermtlocfigure ] top .    in order to measure the correlation of the lowest eigenmodes of this rmt model to the diagonal entries",
    ", we again define the latter `` as averaged by a particular mode '' @xmath117 one can see in [ sparsermtlocfigure ] bottom , that the low modes are indeed localized to `` islands '' of low @xmath118 , which are equivalent to low polyakov loops .",
    "hence this important effect is shared by our random matrix model , too .",
    "in the present paper we found a possible explanation for the emergence of localized poissonian modes at the low end of the high temperature qcd dirac spectrum .",
    "we showed that the localized modes are strongly correlated with large fluctuations of the polyakov loop .",
    "this lowers the effective matsubara frequencies for modes concentrated there .",
    "we argued that the lowest part of the dirac spectrum consists of this type of eigenmodes .",
    "we verified this picture for eigenmodes of both the staggered and the overlap dirac operator .",
    "as a side result we also demonstrated that the spatial structure of the lowest overlap and staggered modes is highly correlated .",
    "this shows that different discretizations of the dirac operator are sensitive to the same type of gauge field fluctuations .",
    "we also looked at the topological charge fluctuations as given by the index of the overlap . assuming that at high temperature topological objects form a dilute gas and are uncorrelated",
    ", we could safely rule them out in creating the localized low modes .    finally , we proposed a dimensionally reduced random matrix model .",
    "it is based on sparse matrices encoding the three dimensional nature of the problem through nearest neighbor couplings from a lattice dirac operator . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is an example of a new kind of random matrix models for qcd , where so far only full matrices have been used . beside chirality and the spectral gap our model reproduces the transition from localized poissonian to delocalized random matrix type modes observed in the lattice dirac spectrum as well as the correlation of the localized modes to `` islands '' of low on site `` potential '' .",
    "it is instructive to compare the dirac operator to the hamiltonian of anderson type models , see @xcite for reviews . in the latter case",
    "usually diagonal ( on site ) disorder is responsible for creating the transition to localized eigenmodes . in the case of the dirac operator ,",
    "the on site terms do not seem to be relevant .",
    "in fact , in the staggered operator they are exactly zero . however ,",
    "in our dimensionally reduced three dimensional effective model the non - zero fluctuating on site terms are dynamically generated by fluctuations of the local matsubara frequency resulting from fluctuations of the polyakov loop . in this way our dimensionally reduced effective random matrix model is analogous to the anderson model",
    ". it would be interesting to study further how the presence and details of the transition depend on the parameters and matrix size defining the random matrix ensemble .",

    "<S> we investigate low - lying fermion modes in @xmath0 gauge theory at temperatures above the phase transition . both staggered and overlap spectra reveal transitions from chaotic ( random matrix ) to integrable ( poissonian ) behavior accompanied by an increasing localization of the eigenmodes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the latter are trapped by local polyakov loop fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> islands of such `` wrong '' polyakov loops can therefore be viewed as defects leading to anderson localization in gauge theories . </S>",
    "<S> we find strong similarities in the spatial profile of these localized staggered and overlap eigenmodes . we discuss possible interpretations of this finding and present a sparse random matrix model that reproduces these features . </S>"
