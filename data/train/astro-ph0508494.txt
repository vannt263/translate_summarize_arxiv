    "the famous quote by john wheeler that ",
    "black holes have no hair  refers to their amazing simplicity .",
    "theoretically they can be _ completely _ described by mass , spin and charge , while in any realistic astrophysical situation this reduces to simply mass and spin . however , black holes are most easily studied if they accrete , where the infalling material converts some of its immense gravitational potential energy to high energy radiation before disappearing forever below the event horizon .",
    "thus there is another parameter which describes the appearance of the most easily observed black holes , namely their mass accretion rate .",
    "this theoretical simplicity is at first glance wildly at odds with the observed complexity of emission from accreting black holes .",
    "this is especially evident in the stellar mass black holes in our galaxy ( gbhc ) , where there is now a huge amount of high signal - to - noise data covering a large range of different mass accretion rates .",
    "however , recent progress has shown that these data can all be fit together into a coherent phenomenological framework , and that this can plausibly relate to physically based models of the accretion flow ( done & gierliski 2003 , hereafter dg03 ) .",
    "the general picture emerging from the data is that the major hard - soft transition seen in the gbhc is consistent with being triggered by a change in the nature and geometry of the inner accretion flow from a hot , optically thin , geometrically thick plasma to a cool , optically thick , geometrically thin disc ( poutanen et al 1997 ; esin et al 1997 ) .",
    "here we try to scale up the physical models of accretion which are so successful in describing the data from the galactic black holes to the accreting supermassive black holes which power active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and quasars .",
    "the goal is synthetise both theory and observations , to build a physically based model which can explain the data from accretion flows onto all masses of black hole .",
    "the gbhc all have fairly similar mass , but show a wide variety of mass accretion rates due to the disc instability ( king & ritter 1998 ) .",
    "these data give a observational template showing how the accretion flow varies as a function of ( predominantly ) mass accretion rate i.e. @xmath0 .",
    "the standard disc models predict a very robust quasi - blackbody spectrum , with temperature @xmath1  kev i.e. @xmath2  kev for a @xmath3 gbhc accreting at the eddington limit .",
    "such spectra are seen , but are generally accompanied by a weak ( ultrasoft state : us ) , moderate ( high state : hs ) or strong ( very high state : vhs ) x - ray tail to higher energies .",
    "together these form the soft states , which are seen at high @xmath0 .",
    "however , at low @xmath0 these objects can also show spectra which look entirely unlike a disk , peaking instead at @xmath4 kev ( low / hard states : ls ) . fig .",
    "1a shows representative spectra from all these gbh states ( e.g. the review by tanaka & lewin 1995 ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     agn accretion flows should be similar to those in gbh at the same @xmath0 , except that the much larger mass black hole leads to a lower accretion disk temperature ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "however , studying the agn accretion flows is difficult as the black hole mass is much harder to determine , so giving large uncertainties on @xmath0 .",
    "this problem can now be addressed using the recently discovered correlations of central black hole mass with the luminosity / velocity dispersion of the bulge , or the line width of the narrow line region , or reverberation mapping ( e.g. woo & urry 2002 ) .",
    "the other problem is signal - to - noise , with only the @xmath5 brightest agn having adequate spectra in rxte .",
    "again , this is now changing due to the unprecedented sensitivity of the epic camera ( 0.210 kev ) on esa s _ xmm - newton _ satellite",
    "if the models which describe the gbh spectra really do work then we can use the same code to _ predict _ what we should see from agn , assuming that the _ only _ change in the accretion flow structure is due to the mass of the black hole changing the temperature of the disk .",
    "since @xmath6 for a given @xmath0 then the gbh temperature range of 0.31.2  kev observed in the @xmath3 stellar black holes scales to 520  ev for a @xmath7 agn .",
    "the grey lines in the spectral panels of fig .",
    "2 show the effect of this seed photon temperature change on the eqpair comptonised spectra assuming the _ same geometries _ as used for the gbh .",
    "the vertical lines on these spectra show the relevant bandpasses of the _ rxte _ pca ( gbhc : dashed line ) and _ xmm - newton _ epic instruments ( agn : dotted ) , respectively .",
    "plainly these models predict that the analogue of the soft states in agn will have no direct disk emission in the xmm - newton bandpass .",
    "the predicted spectra are approximately power laws , and soft excesses should be weak and rare .",
    "for all the states , the lower seed photon temperature means that the comptonised spectra extend to lower energies and are slightly softer .",
    "thus the soft state spectra always have comptonised emission with @xmath8 , and even the hard state spectra have @xmath9 .",
    "the bright quasar sample are objects selected by their strong blue / uv continuum flux , i.e. have a strong accretion disc component so should correspond to the soft state .",
    "this is confirmed by their estimated @xmath10 , with the majority spanning the range between @xmath11 .",
    "we selected all the publicly available ( as of september 2003 ) x - ray spectra from _ xmm - newton _ archive .",
    "we fit these 26 objects with a continuum model consisting of two comptonized components .",
    "the hot component produces the power - law spectrum , while the cool one gives freedom to model any soft x - ray excess .",
    "contrary to expectations , _ all _ the objects _ require _ a soft excess component .",
    "fig 3a shows the characteristics of the soft excess for each object , plotting temperature against strength of the soft excess , @xmath12 , measured by the ratio of unabsorbed 0.32 kev flux in the cool and hot components .",
    "the most striking property of the soft excess is its constancy in temperature .",
    "it is distributed in a very narrow range of values between 0.1 and 0.2  kev , and does not correlate in any way with the expected disc temperature estimated from black hole mass and @xmath0 . equally contrary to expectation is the spectral index of the hot comptonisation component .",
    "fig 3b shows this plotted against the estimated @xmath0 for each object .",
    "while there is the same general trend as in the gbhc for high @xmath0 objects to be steeper , there are several agn which are at high eddington fractions which have @xmath13 , and that many of these have strong soft x - ray excesses ( @xmath14 ) , denoted by filled symbols ( gierliski & done 2004 ) .",
    "pg  1211 + 143 is the most extreme example of this in our sample .",
    "it has @xmath15 for the intrinsic ( reflection and ionised absorption corrected ) continuum , and also has a strong soft x - ray excess .",
    "similar objects are also seen in the literature , with the strongest soft excesses often seen in narrow line seyfert 1 s ( e.g. 1h 0419 - 577 : page et al 2002 ; 1h 0707 - 495 : fabian et al 2002 ) .",
    "plainly there are problems in a simple application of the gbh spectral models to agn .",
    "either the gbh models are wrong , or there are additional physical processes which break the scaling between agn and gbh .",
    "one obvious candidate for additional complexity in the agn spectra is the generic presence of partially ionised absorption .",
    "the environment around an agn is often gas - rich , and x - ray illumination of distant material such as the molecular torus can form a partially ionised wind ( krolik & kriss 2001 ) .",
    "however , changes in this absorption on fairly short timescales suggest that at least some component of this is directly associated with the disk ( e.g. pounds et al 2003 ) .",
    "the low disk temperature in agn means that most of the disk material has substantial opacity from all elements except h and he .",
    "there are multiple line transitions from these elements in the uv band , where the disk spectra peak , so these can result in a strong line - driven wind from the disk .",
    "by contrast , the higher disk temperature in gbh means the disk has much lower opacity , predicting a much weaker wind ( proga & kallman 2002 ) .",
    "the gratings on _ xmm - newton _ and chandra have shown the ionised absorption in agn in unprecedented detail .",
    "in general , multiple absorption components are seen , with different outflow velocities , columns and ionisation states ( e.g. blustin et al .",
    "however , these absorbers are included in the fits to pg  1211 + 143 , and make no substantial difference to the size of soft excess or hardness of the 210  kev spectrum .",
    "however , these absorption components are identified by their _",
    "narrow _ atomic features , implying that the dispersion in velocity along the line of sight is rather small .",
    "this is _ not _ what is expected from the disc wind described above . instead this should be differentially rotating , and outflowing , so has a very complex velocity structure which gives substantial _ broadening _ ( murray & chiang 1997 ) .",
    "we refit the data with a model in which there is only one comptonised component i.e. no additional soft excess , together with a simple model of the absorption expected from a discwind ( an ionised absorber convolved with a gaussian velocity dispersion ) .",
    "fig 3c shows the new distribution of spectral indices with @xmath0 .",
    "_ all _ the agn now have intrinsically steep spectra ( @xmath8 ) as expected for the supermassive analogues of the soft state gbhc .",
    "the typical velocity dispersions are @xmath16 , as expected if the wind is launched from close to the last stable orbit of the disc , and the columns required are @xmath17 @xmath18 ( gierliski & done 2004 ) .",
    "such absorption models models can fit the data from individual bright objects as well as a separate soft excess component or ionised reflection ( sobolewska & done 2004 ) .",
    "_ all _ the data from the galactic black hole binaries is consistent with showing the same spectral evolution as a function of increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this evolution can be qualitatively modelled by a change in the nature and geometry of the accretion flow , from a hot , geometrically thick plasma to a cool , geometrically thin disc .",
    "the implications of this on the emitted spectrum can be quantified using sophisticated comptonisation codes , and these can match the observed data .",
    "these models , with the addition of a boundary layer , can also explain the rather different spectral evolution seen from the disc accretion neutron star binary systems .",
    "the comptonisation models can easily be scaled up to _ predict _ the spectra from agn and quasars , assuming that the physics of the accretion flow is the same . however , these predictions conflict with the observed spectra of the pg quasar sample .",
    "these all have high @xmath0 so should be soft state analogues of the gbhc , but several have rather hard 210  kev spectra , and all require an additional soft x - ray component which has no obvious counterpart in the gbhc . instead we suggest that these spectra _ are _ as predicted by the models , but that our view of them is distorted by complex , partially ionised absorption from an accretion disc wind .",
    "the large velocity shifts in the wind smear the intrinsically narrow absorption features so that the material gives no clearly identifiable signal in high resolution grating data .",
    "the difference between the gbhc and agn is then that the agn have strong absorption from a discwind , while the gbhc do not .",
    "this can easily be explained by the much lower disc temperature expected in supermassive black holes .",
    "firstly this means that the disc itself retains substantial opacity , so there is much more line driving force for launching the wind , and secondly , heavy elements in the wind are less likely to be completely ionised , so have more effect on the x - ray spectrum . while such models are speculative , the alternative is that we missing some substantial piece of accretion physics in the galactic black hole models ."
