    "structure formation in many - body systems is one of central problems of non - equilibrium physics .",
    "a most spectacular phenomena of structure formation is clustering of matter . here",
    "an initially structureless , almost homogeneous distribution of particles of matter self - assembles into clusters . such an evolution can not proceed indefinitely in a gas where interactions between the particles are ( i ) short - range and ( ii ) hamiltonian .",
    "there are two important classes of gases where one of these two properties is violated , and clustering can occur . in the first one _ long - range _ forces , such as gravity , are present .",
    "clustering provides here a natural mechanism of star formation @xcite and of the large - scale structure of the universe @xcite .",
    "the second class of systems are dissipative systems where interactions between the particles , at the level of an effective description , are _ non - hamiltonian_. one well - known example is optically thin gases and plasmas that cool by their own radiation , and dense condensations develop @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a more basic non - hamiltonian many - body system : a gas of inelastically colliding macroscopic particles , or granular gas . here",
    "particles lose energy to their internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the granular gas is the low - density limit of granular flows @xcite . in its simplest version ,",
    "the granular gas model deals with a dilute assembly of identical hard spheres ( with diameter @xmath3 and unit mass ) who lose energy at instantaneous binary collisions in such a way that the normal component of the relative velocity of particles is reduced by a constant factor @xmath4 ( the coefficient of normal restitution ) upon each collision .",
    "granular gases exhibit a plethora of structure forming instabilities , including the clustering instability of a freely cooling homogeneous inelastic gas @xcite .",
    "this instability brings about the generation of a macroscopic flow and formation of dense clusters of particles .    the natural language for a theoretical description of macroscopic flows of a granular gas is the navier - stokes granular hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "although the criteria of its validity are quite restrictive , see below , granular hydrodynamics is instrumental for theoretical investigations , and often prediction , of a host of collective effects in granular flows .",
    "recently , applications of granular hydrodynamics have been extended to non - stationary flows of granular gases @xcite .",
    "the non - stationary settings provide sharp tests to continuum models of granular flows and help evaluate their domains of validity .",
    "this is especially true when the time - dependent solutions of the continuum equations develop finite - time singularities @xcite , such as the recently predicted density blowup in freely cooling granular gases : at zero gravity @xcite , and at finite gravity @xcite .",
    "we will assume throughout this paper nearly elastic particle collisions , a very small gas density ( that we denote by @xmath5 ) , and a very small knudsen number : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the dimension of space , @xmath8 is the mean free path of the particles , and @xmath9 is the characteristic length scale of the hydrodynamic fields . under these assumptions",
    "the navier - stokes hydrodynamics provides a quantitatively accurate leading - order theory for granular gases @xcite .",
    "previous works @xcite employed hydrodynamic equations to show that , for sufficiently large systems , the homogeneously cooling state of the granular gas is linearly unstable .",
    "the unstable perturbations grow via two ( linearly ) independent modes : the shear mode corresponding to the development of a macroscopic solenoidal flow , and the clustering mode corresponding to the development of a potential flow that causes formation of clusters of particles .",
    "how does the clustering mode develop beyond the linear regime , and do the hydrodynamic nonlinearities arrest the density growth ? for the clustering instability in large systems ( as well as for the gravitational instability @xcite ) the growing perturbations bring the system into a fully developed non - linear regime @xcite .",
    "therefore , one has to deal with fully non - linear hydrodynamic equations .",
    "not restricting ourselves to a close proximity to the homogeneously cooling state , we can formulate the problem in a more general way and explore different nonlinear flows of a freely evolving granular gas .    solving the hydrodynamic equations analytically , and even numerically ,",
    "is a difficult task , and additional simplifications are needed .",
    "we will make _ two _ additional simplifying assumptions in this work .",
    "first , assuming a large - scale flow , we will neglect the viscous and heat conduction terms in the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "second , we will assume that the macroscopic flow is one - dimensional .",
    "a natural environment for the second assumption is provided by the geometry of a narrow channel with perfectly elastic side walls that we adopt here , following refs .",
    "although the microscopic motion of particles in the channel remains two- or three - dimensional ( 2d or 3d ) , the macroscopic flow depends only on one spatial coordinate : the coordinate along the channel .",
    "this is because , in a narrow channel , both the shear mode and the clustering mode in the transverse directions are suppressed ( see refs . for detail ) . as a result",
    ", one can focus on the development of the ( one - dimensional ) clustering mode as it enters a strongly nonlinear regime .",
    "working in the channel geometry , efrati _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered the long - wavelength limit of the clustering instability , when the linear growth rate of the instability is the highest . in this case",
    "the inelastic energy loss of the gas is the fastest process , and the gas pressure drops , almost instantaneously , to a very small value .",
    "the further dynamics are then ( almost ) purely inertial which would bring about a finite - time blow - up of the velocity gradient and , therefore , of the density .",
    "this is the well known blow - up of the free flow @xcite .",
    "its signatures were observed in the numerical solution of the hydrodynamic equations @xcite until the maximum gas density became so high that the numerical scheme lost accuracy .",
    "the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite were tested in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations in 2d of a freely cooling gas of inelastically colliding disks in a long and narrow channel @xcite .",
    "the md simulations supported the free - flow blow - up scenario until the time when the gas density approached the hexagonal close - packing value , and the further density growth was arrested .    as we have recently found @xcite",
    ", the free flow asymptotics does not hold all the way to the density blowup .",
    "very close , in time and in space , to the ( attempted ) free - flow singularity , the compressional heating starts to act and temporarily stabilizes the gas temperature at a small but finite value . as a result , the gas pressure again becomes important : it breaks the purely inertial dynamics and , though unable to stop the density blowup , dramatically changes the local blowup properties .",
    "it turns out that , after a brief crossover , the further dynamics obey a new blowup scenario , not limited to the long - wavelength limit @xcite .",
    "the new scenario has the following features . as the blow - up time",
    "@xmath0 is approached , the maximum density exhibits a power law @xmath1 .",
    "the velocity gradient blows up as @xmath10 , whereas the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp , rather than a shock discontinuity , at the singularity .",
    "the gas temperature vanishes at the singularity , but the pressure there remains finite .",
    "this blowup , which obeys the above asymptotic laws near the singularity , emerges universally , that is for generic initial and boundary conditions .",
    "( note that , in the long - wavelength limit , the crossover from the free flow regime to the finite - pressure regime does not happen when the initial gas density is not very small . in this case",
    "excluded particle volume effects interfere in the dynamics , and arrest the density growth , _ before _ the crossover has a chance to occur , as indeed was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "these findings are based on extensive numerical simulations ( numerical solutions of the hydrodynamic equations for a host of initial and boundary conditions ) and a family of exact analytical solutions of the hydrodynamic equations , without and with shocks , briefly announced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work",
    "we give a detailed account of the exact solutions and investigate their structure close to the singularity .",
    "we verify the exact solutions numerically .",
    "we show that the singularity follows the isobaric scenario : the gas pressure is approximately uniform in space and constant in time in a close vicinity of the developing singularity .",
    "finally , we evaluate the validity of the exact solutions close to the singularity by estimating the role of additional physical processes : the viscosity , heat conduction and excluded particle volume effects .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section ii we introduce the equations of _ ideal _ granular hydrodynamics ( ighd ) and discuss their general properties . in section [ analytic ]",
    "we employ lagrangian coordinates and derive a family of exact solutions of the ighd equations , consider some particular cases of the solutions and investigate global and local properties of the solutions . in section [ shocks ]",
    "we adapt the exact solutions to describe a different setting , where a piston moves into a granular gas at rest , and a density blowup , developing at the piston , coexists with an  ordinary \" shock wave propagating into the gas .",
    "besides demonstrating the presence of the two different types of singularities in the same system , this solution allows an arbitrary initial density profile at large distances , showing that the density blowup is a local process .",
    "section [ numerics ] presents the results of numerical solutions of the ighd equations that confirm stability of the exact solutions with respect to small one - dimensional perturbations and establish universality of the density blowup for different initial conditions . in section [ regularization ]",
    "we discuss the role of non - ideal effects , neglected in our solutions , close to the singularity . in section [ summary ]",
    "we summarize our results and discuss their bearing on cluster formation .",
    "under the three strong inequalities  ( [ threeineq ] ) , the navier - stokes granular hydrodynamics provides a quantitatively accurate leading - order theory for granular gases .",
    "it deals with three coarse - grained fields : the mass density @xmath11 , the mean flow velocity @xmath12 and the granular temperature @xmath13 .",
    "an additional coarse - grained field , the pressure @xmath14 , is related to the density and temperature by the perfect gas equation of state @xmath15 . assuming a one - dimensional macroscopic flow , we can write these equations as @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the adiabatic index of the gas ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ) , @xmath22 $ ] ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , and @xmath23 is the gamma function .",
    "in addition , @xmath24 and @xmath25 in 2d , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 in 3d , see ref . .",
    "the only difference between eqs .",
    "( [ hydrodynamics1])-([hydrodynamics3 ] ) and the standard gas dynamic equations for a dilute gas of _ elastically _ colliding spheres is the presence in eq .",
    "( [ hydrodynamics3 ] ) of the inelastic energy loss term @xmath28 .",
    "there are three types of dissipative terms in eqs .",
    "( [ hydrodynamics1])-([hydrodynamics3 ] ) : the viscous terms in eqs .",
    "( [ hydrodynamics2 ] ) and ( [ hydrodynamics3 ] ) , the heat conduction term in eq .",
    "( [ hydrodynamics3 ] ) and the energy loss term in eq .",
    "( [ hydrodynamics3 ] ) .",
    "the viscous and heat conduction terms include spatial gradients of the hydrodynamic fields , whereas the energy loss term is independent of the gradients .",
    "when the characteristic hydrodynamic length scale of the flow is sufficiently large , the viscous and heat conduction terms can be neglected , while the energy loss term should be kept , and we arrive at the equations of _ ideal _ granular hydrodynamics ( ighd ) : @xmath29 for consistency , all the assumptions must be checked _",
    "a posteriori _ , after a hydrodynamic problem in question is solved , and the hydrodynamic length and time scales are found .    the basic state of the freely cooling gas is the homogeneously cooling state described by the haff law @xcite : @xmath30 this state corresponds to the initial conditions @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "obviously , the ighd equations reproduce the haff s law exactly , as the homogeneously cooling state does not include gradients of the hydrodynamic fields .",
    "a more meaningful example of a situation where the ighd applies is provided by the linear stability analysis of the homogeneously cooling state .",
    "this analysis , in the framework of the complete , non - ideal navier - stokes hydrodynamics ( [ hydrodynamics1])-([hydrodynamics3 ] ) and its extensions was performed by many workers , starting from goldhirsch and collaborators @xcite and mcnamara @xcite .",
    "the main results of the linear stability analysis can be described , at the level of order - of - magnitude estimates , as follows .",
    "the evolution of a small sinusoidal perturbation with the wave number @xmath34 is determined by two competing processes .",
    "the inelastic energy loss tends to enhance the fluctuations on the cooling time scale @xmath35^{-1}$ ] which is @xmath34-independent . in its turn ,",
    "the viscosity and thermal conduction tend to erase the perturbation on a time scale @xmath36^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath37 is the mean free path and @xmath38 is the characteristic value of the viscosity / heat conductivity . balancing these two time scales ,",
    "one obtains the critical wave number @xmath39 so that the perturbations with @xmath40 grow , while the short - wavelength perturbations , @xmath41 , decay @xcite . in a narrow channel ,",
    "such that perturbations in the transverse direction with wave numbers smaller than @xmath42 are not allowed , only perturbations along the channel will grow . as a result , by the end of the linear stage , the hydrodynamic fields are effectively one - dimensional and have characteristic length scales of the order of @xmath43 or longer .",
    "the validity of the navier - stokes hydrodynamics ( [ hydrodynamics1])-([hydrodynamics3 ] ) for the description of the whole range of unstable perturbations demands a strong inequality @xmath44 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ighd model  ( [ a311 ] ) and ( [ a322 ] ) is valid if we demand a strong inequality @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , one can check that , in this case , the growth rate of the clustering instability , as obtained from the ighd , coincides in the leading order in @xmath46 with that obtained from the full hydrodynamic equations .",
    "in section [ regularization ] we will perform a consistency check , and establish the validity domain , of our exact _ nonlinear _ solutions of the ighd equations ( [ a311 ] ) and  ( [ a322 ] ) .",
    "now let us discuss the basic properties of these equations .",
    "although much simpler than the non - ideal equations ( [ hydrodynamics1])-([hydrodynamics3 ] ) , the nonlinear ighd equations still present a hard mathematical problem .",
    "going back to elastic particle collisions , @xmath47 , one recovers the ordinary ideal gas dynamics in one dimension . among most interesting solutions",
    "are those describing the development of wave - breaking singularities when starting from smooth initial data @xcite .",
    "note that , even for @xmath47 , the general initial value problem is not soluble analytically , except for the particular case of an isentropic flow , where the entropy per unit volume @xmath48 is uniform in space and constant in time @xcite .",
    "needless to say , at @xmath49 , eqs .",

    "the entropy loss implies that the system may exhibit self - organization phenomena @xcite as is indeed observed in the process of clustering instability .    before deriving a family of exact solutions exhibiting a finite - time density blowup , we note two rescaling symmetries of eqs .",
    "( [ a311 ] ) and ( [ a322 ] ) .",

    "we first estimate all the ratios in the inner region , see subsection [ local ] .",
    "as both @xmath434 and @xmath435 vanish linearly as @xmath436 , their ratio depends on time only weakly , and can be estimated by its value at @xmath70 .",
    "as @xmath437 ( see subsection [ lagrangian ] ) , we find @xmath438 that is the viscous stress is always negligible in our solutions as long as @xmath439 .",

    "we estimate the ratio of the heat conduction term to the inelastic cooling term as follows : @xmath441 the same estimate is obtained for the ratio of the heat conduction term to the compressional heating term .",
    "this ratio becomes of order unity at @xmath442 . at this time @xmath443 ,",
    "( [ freepath ] ) , so the ighd equations break down while the full navier - stokes hydrodynamics , eqs .",
    "( [ hydrodynamics1])-([hydrodynamics3 ] ) , is still valid .    in its turn , the dilute gas assumption , @xmath444 , breaks down , and excluded particle volume effects become important , at @xmath445 .",
    "the relative role of the heat conduction and excluded particle volume effects in the breakdown of our analytic solutions near the attempted singularity is determined by the competition between the small parameters @xmath446 and @xmath447 .",
    "when @xmath448 , our solutions remain valid until the density becomes comparable with the ( fraction of ) close packing density .",

    "one can use , in numerical solutions , a half - empiric equation of state due to carnahan and starling @xcite , and half - empiric transport coefficients obtained for granular gases @xcite in the spirit of enskog kinetic theory @xcite .    when @xmath451 the heat conduction becomes important when the gas is still dilute .",
    "this happens at time @xmath452 so that @xmath453 .",
    "as long as @xmath454 , the knudsen number is still small at that time , and the complete navier - stokes hydrodynamics is still applicable .",
    "therefore , as the blowup time @xmath0 is approached , either the heat conduction , or the excluded particle volume effects become important and invalidate our theory in the inner region . in this sense ,",
    "our solutions describe an intermediate asymptotic regime of formation of a dense cluster of particles .",
    "importantly , in the outer region our solutions remain valid until much later times . indeed , as the inner region shrinks , it leaves behind stationary profiles of the fields , see subsection [ local ] .",
    "the ratios of the different terms governing the ighd validity are given , at some @xmath82 from the outer region , by the corresponding ratios in the inner region estimated at the time when @xmath455 , while in the outer region , @xmath456 , our solutions continue to hold .",
    "the fact that the ighd description breaks down only locally , in a small region of space , can be exploited for derivation of an _ effective _ description of the clustering dynamics beyond the singularity time . in this description",
    "close - packed clusters appear as finite - mass point - like singularities of the density @xcite .",
    "this effective description is similar in spirit to the description of shocks ( that actually have finite widths ) as discontinuities in ordinary ideal gas dynamics .",
    "let us briefly summarize the main results of this work .",
    "we introduced  ideal granular hydrodynamics \" ( ighd ) equations that provide a simple but informative description of non - stationary large - scale flows of dilute granular gases with nearly elastic collisions between the particles .",
    "we employed the ighd equations to investigate analytically and numerically the paradigmatic phenomenon of particle clustering in freely cooling granular gases .",
    "we believe that the ighd will provide a useful framework for a host of other problems involving large - scale flows of _ driven _ granular gases .",
    "we focused on a one - dimensional granular hydrodynamic flow , characteristic of an idealized channel geometry , and derived a family of exact nonlinear and non - stationary analytic solutions of the ighd that describe a finite - time blowup of the gas density .",
    "the derivation was made possible by a transformation of the hydrodynamic equations to lagrangian coordinates .",
    "the exact solutions are characterized by a constant in time accelerations in the lagrangian frame , and they are not self - similar .",
    "we investigated the local structure of the flow near the singularity and determined local spatial and temporal scaling laws for the hydrodynamic quantities in question .",
    "we also found an instructive soluble case of the problem of a piston entering , at a constant speed , a granular gas at rest . here",
    "a density singularity , developing at the piston , coexists with a shock wave that is located elsewhere . besides demonstrating the presence of the two different types of singularities in the same system , this solution allows an arbitrary density profile at large distances , showing that the density blowup is a local process . in all of these solutions",
    "the developing singularity obeys locally the isobaric scenario @xcite : the gas pressure remains approximately uniform in space and constant in time in a close vicinity of the blowup point .",
    "this finding has important consequences for the theory of clustering .",
    "indeed , by imposing , in the zeroth order of theory , the isobaricity condition on the hydrodynamic equations , one arrives at a powerful reduced description of the nonlinear clustering process .",
    "this description is valid for a much broader class of initial conditions than those giving rise to the exact solutions reported in the present work .",
    "the corresponding results will be presented elsewhere .",
    "our numerical solutions of the ighd equations accurately reproduce the analytic solutions , thus confirming their stability with respect to small one - dimensional perturbations .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations with a variety of initial and boundary conditions showed that that the local scaling laws near the singularity are universal , that is independent of details of the initial and boundary conditions .",
    "we also analyzed additional physical effects , neglected in ighd , which become important in a narrow spatial region near the attempted singularity .",
    "depending on the parameters , either excluded particle volume effects , or heat conduction invalidate our solutions there . in the former case , the density growth should directly cross over to the formation of close - packed clusters of particles . in the latter case ,",
    "the final outcome of the nonlinear density growth is yet unknown",
    ". the future work should find out whether the heat conduction arrests the density blowup or only modifies the singularity law . in any case",
    ", our exact solutions can be viewed as instructive intermediate asymptotics , describing a broad class of strongly nonlinear clustering flows of granular gases .",
    "no less important , as breakdown of these solutions occurs only in the narrow regions around the density peaks , it is possible to continue the ideal solutions _ beyond _ the singularity by introducing into the theory finite - mass point - like singularities of the density .",
    "this procedure yields a simple effective description of granular gases with embedded close - packed clusters , in much the same way as the ideal gas dynamics describes a gas flow with shock discontinuities @xcite .",
    "very recently , one of our exact solutions has been successfully tested against md simulations of the dynamics of a very dilute gas of nearly elastically colliding identical hard disks in a very long and narrow 2d channel .",
    "the results will be presented elsewhere .",
    "finally , we note that the power law of the density blowup near the singularity , @xmath457 , is the same as the one recently found in a different setting : that of an initially thermalized granular gas , freely cooling and collapsing under gravity @xcite . in each of the two problems the momentum equation is  fast \" , while the energy equation is  slow \" in a small vicinity of the collapse .",
    "this suggests common physics behind the two collapse phenomena and demands further investigation .",
