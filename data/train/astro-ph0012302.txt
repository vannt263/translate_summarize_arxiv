    "the inner galaxy remains neglected .",
    "we have recently begun the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ) , a large - scale project to image the @xmath0-cm continuum and  spectral line in the fourth quadrant of the galactic plane with high angular and velocity resolution @xcite .",
    "the sgps makes use of high spatial resolution data from the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and short spacing information from the parkes 64 m single dish .",
    "the final project will provide a complete  dataset of @xmath5  and @xmath6 at an angular resolution of 2 , and with velocity resolution of @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , we have extended the single dish coverage to @xmath8 in order to study large scale structures which protrude from the galactic plane .",
    "this dataset is particularly useful for studying the structure and dynamics of the neutral medium , on which massive stars have a significant impact .",
    "o and b stars not only affect the medium through ionization , as in the case of  regions , they also perturb the medium through winds and at the end of their lives , as supernovae .",
    "the resultant supernova remnants ( snrs ) plow shocks through the neutral medium , ionizing and compressing the medium and leaving a lasting impression . not only do  regions and snrs impact the ism , the structure of the ism - particularly density enhancements - affects the morphology of  regions and snrs . after the snr or  region has ceased to exist in continuum , the imprint may remain in the ism in the form of an  shell . because of the large range of spatial scales sampled with the combined parkes and atca data , the sgps is an ideal dataset in which to explore these effects .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the details of the southern galactic plane survey with attention to  spectral line and @xmath921-cm continuum data from the sgps test region ( @xmath1 ; @xmath10 ) .",
    "other scientific highlights from the sgps are discussed elsewhere : two large  shells discovered in the parkes data are presented in @xcite , preliminary images of  emission and absorption features are presented in @xcite , and the polarization properties of the test region are presented in @xcite . here",

    ", we seek to create a three - dimensional view of the galaxy in this subregion .",
    "the general goal of the southern galactic plane survey is to provide a dataset with which to study the structure and dynamics of the neutral hydrogen ( ) in the inner galaxy .",
    "previous studies of the inner galaxy have lacked the sensitivity and resolution necessary to study the physical processes of the interstellar medium ( ism ) over a large range of spatial scales .",
    "though the specific goals of the sgps are numerous , we will highlight a few below :    * the sgps will allow us to address questions about the spatial distributions and scale heights of the warm and cool components of the neutral medium in order to understand the thermal phases of the interstellar medium . * combining the parkes and atca data",
    ", we will be able to probe the interstellar medium through a broad range of spatial scales in order to develop a statistical interpretation of the neutral ism throughout the inner galaxy .",
    "*  emission data over the large range of spatial scales available in the sgps will allow us to detect a full sample of  shells with which to study not only the formation of shells - particularly of the largest , most enigmatic ones - but also their distribution in the galaxy and global effect on galactic structure . * a number of  self - absorption ( hisa )",
    "features are apparent in the sgps test region @xcite .",
    "hisa , where cold  clouds absorb the diffuse background  emission , is an excellent probe of the distribution of the coldest , most compact  clouds .",
    "further exploration of these features will be presented in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "* the dataset will provide  absorption spectra for distance estimates of many galactic objects and may be useful in identifying those extragalactic sources located close to the galactic plane . *",
    "the inclusion of full polarization information for the continuum data will allow us to explore the polarization structure of individual objects , such as supernova remnants , and to investigate the galactic magnetic field structure using the polarization of the diffuse background emission .",
    "results of the polarization properties of the test region appear in @xcite .",
    "observations of the sgps test region were made with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ; frater , brooks , & whiteoak 1992 ) and parkes radio telescope .",
    "the atca is an east - west synthesis instrument near narrabri nsw , with six 22  m antennas on a 6  km track .",
    "five antennas are movable into configurations with baselines between 31  m and 6  km .",
    "the atca data consist of a 190 pointing mosaic covering @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "these data were obtained during five separate observing sessions between april 1997 and april 1998 . the observing dates and times",

    "the observations were made with several compact array configurations - 750a , 750c , 750d , and 375 - in order to obtain maximum sensitivity to large scale structures .",
    "each of the 190 pointings was observed in forty 30  s snapshots at a broad range of hour angles for good _ u - v _ coverage .",
    "the pointings for the test region were arranged on a square grid with 15separation ( nyquist ) as determined by the atca primary beam fwhm , which is 33  at @xmath9 - 21 cm .",

    ", super - uniform weighting minimizes sidelobe levels to improve the dynamic range and sensitivity to extended structure .",
    "uniform weighting reduces to natural weighting , however , if the field of view is much larger than the primary beam , as is the case for large mosaics .",
    "super - uniform weighting overcomes this limitation by decoupling the weighting from the field size @xcite . in this manner",
    "super - uniform weighting attempts to minimize sidelobe contributions from strong sources over a region smaller than the full field being imaged and therefore is typically more successful than uniform weighting on large mosaics @xcite .",
    "the specifics of the calibration and imaging of atca polarization data are described in @xcite , here we discuss only the stokes i continuum and  data .",
    "two  data cubes were produced .",
    "in one cube the continuum emission was subtracted from the  _ u - v _ data using the miriad task uvlin .",

    "the method of joint deconvolution is very effective for maximizing the _ u - v _ coverage attainable in mosaiced observations @xcite . despite deconvolution ,",
    "some sidelobes are visible around strong point sources in the continuum and  images .",
    "though mosaicing allows us to recover angular scales larger than normal interferometric observations by reducing the effective shortest projected baseline , we are nonetheless limited in practice to angular scales smaller than @xmath23 , where @xmath24  m is the shortest baseline of the atca , and @xmath25  m is the diameter of a single antenna .",
    "this limits the atca data to angular scales smaller than @xmath26 . in order to recover information on larger size scales",

    "the parkes radio telescope is a 64  m antenna situated near parkes nsw , australia .",
    "it has a thirteen beam , @xmath921-cm receiver package at prime focus @xcite .",
    "the sgps test region was observed on 1998 december 15 - 16 .",
    "the parkes survey was subsequently expanded to @xmath27 for more complete coverage of large scale structures during additional observing sessions : 1998 june 18 - 21 , 1999 september 18 - 27 , and 2000 march 10 - 15 .",
    "observations were made by the process of mapping `` on - the - fly '' with the inner seven beams of the multibeam system .",
    "data were recorded in 5  s samples , while scanning through three degrees in galactic latitude .",
    "the data were taken in frequency switching mode using the narrowband back - end @xcite , with a total bandwidth of 8 mhz across 2048 channels .",
    "though the parkes data are frequency switched , total power information for each sample is retained .",
    "each sample was divided by the previous frequency switched sample and the residual bandpass shape fitted with a series of fourier components .",
    "the spectra were then multiplied by the mean of the reference signal over the spectrum to reconstruct the continuum emission with a flat baseline .",
    "absolute brightness temperature calibration of the  line data was performed from observations of the iau standard regions s6 and s9 @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the observing strategy , calibration , and imaging procedures is found in @xcite .",
    "off - line channels were used for continuum subtraction and to produce the continuum image using the aips task imlin .",

    "the final , calibrated data have a bandwidth of 4 mhz with 1024 channels , such that the velocity resolution of @xmath29  matches the atca data .    it should be noted that the data presented here have not been corrected for the effects of stray radiation",
    ". stray radiation leakage from bright emission through the back sidelobes of a single dish beam introduces baseline errors which are typically between @xmath30  k and @xmath31  k @xcite . when compared to low latitude galactic spectra , this is a small percentage , but it does nonetheless limit the sensitivity and accurate representation of extended features in the parkes data . the data for the entire survey will have a first order stray radiation correction applied .",
    "a complete correction requires a low resolution survey of the entire sky with a known antenna pattern in order to reconstruct the stray radiation at every point on the sky , at any azimuth and elevation , and at any time of the year .",
    "such a task is beyond the scope of this project . a first order correction , however , can be done by re - observing the survey region at different times of the year and comparing the spectra . the velocity shifts caused by the earth s motion around the sun result in excess emission at different velocities .",
    "we have , therefore , re - observed the full survey region four times at three month intervals around the year and we will compare each spectrum .",
    "the minimum value at each velocity will be a reasonable upper limit to the stray radiation corrected profile , good to within @xmath32  k of @xmath33 .",
    "the final step of imaging involves combining the parkes and atca data .",
    "the data may be combined in the fourier domain after deconvolution of the individual images or in the _ u - v _ plane prior to deconvolution .",
    "@xcite showed that the results are comparable using either method , but that combining after deconvolution produced results that were typically more consistent than with other methods .",
    "comparison of our data combined in both ways shows similar results .",
    "we have chosen , therefore , to combine the data in the fourier domain after deconvolution . in this method ,",
    "the interferometric data  and continuum data are imaged and deconvolved , the single - dish data are imaged and the clean interferometric and single - dish images are fourier transformed and combined .",
    "this technique is implemented in the miriad task immerge .",
    "slight differences in calibration can lead to the necessity of a relative calibration factor by which the single - dish dataset is multiplied before combination .",
    "this calibration factor is determined by comparing the datasets in the fourier plane at every pixel and frequency in the range of overlapping spatial frequencies . in order to calculate the calibration factor",
    "both images must be deconvolved , a step which requires a good knowledge of the single - dish beam @xcite . using a two dimensional gaussian with fwhm @xmath34 for the parkes beam and by comparing the parkes and atca continuum images of a strong , compact source in the test region , we calculated a relative calibration factor of 1.19 .",

    "[ fig:21cont ] we can observe how these filaments relate to the larger - scale diffuse emission .",

    "clearly , the filaments are the snr edges which the interferometers can detect , while they can not detect the large - scale smooth emission in the center of the remnant . by contrast , there are many loops and filaments near snr g330.2 + 1.0 that appear filamentary in both the most and sgps images , implying that they are not part of a larger , filled structure .",

    "in order to create a three - dimensional view of this portion of the galaxy we have extracted  absorption spectra towards the brighter  regions and snrs .",
    "the method we use to determine the hi absorption spectrum is based on averaging the spectra toward the brightest part of the continuum ( `` on - source spectra '' ) , and subtracting an interpolated average of the spectra from the region surrounding the continuum source ( `` off - source spectra '' ; dickey et al .",
    "the on - source spectra are selected based on the continuum image by setting a high threshold , typically 80% of the continuum peak , and including in the average only spectra toward pixels whose continuum brightness is above this high threshold .",
    "these on - source spectra are averaged with weighting factor equal to the continuum brightness in each pixel , which optimizes the signal - to - noise ratio in the resulting absorption spectrum .",
    "similarly , the off - source spectra are selected toward pixels whose continuum brightness is below a low threshold , typically 20% of the continuum peak .",
    "the off - source spectra are not simply averaged , but interpolated to give a better prediction of the emission spectrum in the direction of the continuum peak .",
    "this interpolation is based on a simple bi - linear fit ( least squares fitting a linear function of two dimensions ) done independently for each spectral channel .",
    "the outer boundary for which spectra are included in the off - source interpolation is typically 7 , but for the extended supernova remnant g327.4 + 0.2 we extend the outer boundary to 15",
    ". the high and low thresholds also have to be adjusted in some cases depending on the continuum flux , down to 70% for the high threshold of the faintest sources , and in the range 10% to 30% for the low threshold depending on the angular size of the continuum distribution .",
    "this interpolation process does not change the fundamental angular resolution of the survey , i.e.  it is not an extrapolation on the _ u - v _ plane .",
    "so the spectra derived for both the absorption and the expected emission still correspond to one beam area of roughly 2  diameter .    the absorption spectrum",
    "is then determined by subtracting the interpolated off - source spectrum from the averaged on - source spectrum .",
    "the resultant optical depth spectrum , @xmath79 , is the absorption spectrum divided by the continuum flux averaged over the pixels above the high threshold .",
    "the optical depth spectra towards rcw  94 and g326.65 + 0.59 are shown in fig .",

    "the errors in the absorption spectra are generally dominated by uncertainty in the interpolated emission , particularly at low latitudes where the emission is not smoothly distributed on scales of a few arcminutes . to estimate the error in the absorption we compute the predictions for the off - source spectra based on the bilinear fit to the emission and take the difference between these predictions and the actual spectra in each off - source pixel .",
    "the rms average of these differences gives an error envelope on the interpolated emission in the direction of the continuum peak .",

    "upper distance limits are estimates only , since the absence of an absorption line at the higher velocity is not conclusive evidence that the continuum source is nearer than the hi emission .",
    "a region of 21-cm emission may not show absorption because the cool gas may have a covering factor less than one ( i.e. there may be gaps between absorbing clouds , filled only with warm gas which does not show detectable absorption ) .",
    "this is unlikely for an emission region with column density of @xmath85 or more , which is implied by a line of brightness temperature greater than 35  k. emission lines stronger than this almost always show some absorption , so our upper limit distances should be mostly valid .",

    "one can also make rather uncertain estimates based on associations with nearby objects of known distance , the emission spectrum towards the object , or the more likely linear size and luminosity . for  regions with recombination velocities , comparison of the  absorption velocity with the recombination line velocity can resolve the ambiguity",
    "if the most extreme  absorption is at or near the recombination line velocity then the cloud is at the near distance .",
    "however , if the   absorption is seen beyond the recombination line velocity then the   region is at the far distance .    for all of the  regions presented here we have recombination line velocities from ch87 .",
    "in all cases there is no absorption significantly beyond the recombination line velocity , implying the near distance for these regions .",

    "while it is not clear whether these stars are _ the _ ionizing stars for these regions , their presence does seem to indicate a preference for the near distance of the distance ambiguity .",
    "we note , also , that at a distance of @xmath112  kpc rcw  94 has a physical diameter of @xmath113  pc , a typical diameter for an extended  region . whereas at a distance of 11.1  kpc , the physical diameter would be @xmath114  pc , unusually large for an  region .",
    "the diameter at the larger distance , as well as the nearby massive stars noted in @xcite , are evidence favoring a distance of @xmath112  kpc .    the  emission morphology in the rcw  94 - 95 region between velocities of @xmath115  and @xmath116  is complicated .",
    "we have detected an  shell surrounding rcw  94 centered at @xmath117  .",

    "the shell itself is surrounded by a ring of decreased emission which , although not continuous , is also centered on the region .",
    "the emission shell has an average diameter of @xmath119  pc , a thickness of @xmath120  pc , and shows a brightness temperature increase from the interior to the shell edge of about a factor of two . the  shell morphology closely matches the morphology of the  regions , implying that the shell is indeed related to rcw  94 .",
    "the lack of  inside to the shell is clearly due to ionization in the  region .",
    "the origins of the shell are somewhat less clear . using the column density integrated through the range of velocities including the shell we estimate that the  mass of the shell is @xmath121 .",
    "that the shell extends over @xmath122  suggests that it may be expanding .",
    "the velocity gradient at this place in the galaxy is @xmath123 .",
    "therefore a static shell with velocity width @xmath124  would have an extent of 380  pc along the line - of - sight .",
    "since it is highly unlikely that the shell extends that far , we suggest that the velocity width is due to expansion such that @xmath125 . assuming @xmath126 , we estimate the energy required to form this shell is on the order of @xmath127 ergs , which is consistent with the amount of energy expected from stellar winds over the lifetime of a single massive star .",
    "because of the low expansion velocity , the formation energy for a shell whose expansion has stalled is comparable .",
    "we suggest that the  shell and depression around rcw  94 are the signatures of a molecular cloud encircling the  region . in this case",
    ", the  region appears to be embedded in a molecular cloud , displaying various stages of ionization and dissociation related to the interior stars .",
    "interior to the @xmath119  pc inner shell radius the uv photons from the stars ionize the neutral gas , producing the  region .",
    "the stars photo - dissociate the surrounding molecular gas , producing an  shell which extends to a radius of @xmath128  pc .",
    "the  morphology correspondence with the continuum morphology especially supports this hypothesis .",
    "in particular , the region of dense  emission in the concave portion on the right - hand side of the  region indicates that the expansion of the photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) was impeded by a density enhancement in the external medium , presumably clumps of molecular material .",
    "the extension of the shell surrounding the compact source to the upper left , indicates that the shape of the shell is directly related to the shape of the  region , and that they are therefore correlated .",
    "comparison with the co images of @xcite indicates molecular gas at the position and velocity of rcw  94 . immediately exterior to the  shell we can expect to see emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) at @xmath129 or 11.3  @xcite .",
    "close examination of msx band a data does reveal an increase in emission exterior to the  shell , which also supports the theory that this  region and its  shell are embedded in a molecular cloud .",
    "@xcite explore the polarization properties of this region and find that the depolarization is consistent with being caused by an  region embedded in molecular gas with several layers of ionization and photo - dissociation .",
    "the  depression around rcw  94 appears to extend towards the plane at lower longitudes where it traces the morphology of the large bow shaped structure , g326.96 + 0.03 , seen at the bottom of the continuum image .",
    "this source is seen in the most images , as well as the msx images , and therefore appears to be a thermal source .",
    "we measure  absorption towards the knot of emission at @xmath130 , @xmath131 . though the spectrum is rather noisy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : g327abs ] left ) , we see a strong absorption feature at @xmath132  , which indicates that this region may be slightly more distant than rcw  94 - 95 ( @xmath133  kpc ) , though still in the scutum - crux arm .",
    "there is an extended region of  emission to the left of these  regions which is much brighter than that surrounding rcw  94 - 95 .",
    "the column density in this region , over the range of channels spanning the depression ( @xmath134 to @xmath135 ) , is a factor of two larger than it is surrounding the  shell .",
    "whereas  regions and snrs draw a connection between the  line and continuum emission , the impact of massive stars on the ism can also be seen with  shells , where no continuum object exists .",
    "these cavities survive much longer than the radiative lifetime of a snr or an  region , allowing us to explore the lasting effects of massive stars on the ism .",
    "shells are often detected as voids in the  with brightened `` walls '' of swept - up material .",
    "these shells can range in size from tens of parsecs to kiloparsecs .",
    "the majority of the shells , especially the smaller ones , are caused by the combined effects of stellar winds and supernovae @xcite .",
    "the ultimate destruction of an  shell occurs on the time - scale of tens of millions of years when they eventually dissipate as a result of turbulent motions in the ism and shear due to differential rotation in the galaxy .",
    "we have detected two small shells in the sgps test region @xcite .",
    "the first of these appears as an  void at @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138  , the terminal velocity for this line of sight .",

    "there is only one detectable cap for a large majority of the shells catalogued by @xcite .",
    "detecting only one cap makes it difficult to estimate an expansion velocity .",
    "it may be that the shell is stalled or that the structure is mostly cylindrical and expanding in the plane of the sky .",

    "its distance is very uncertain , we estimate @xmath146  pc , which implies a physical radius of only @xmath147  pc . given its small size we speculate that this shell may have been formed by an old snr .",
    "there are no associated features in the continuum image .",
    "studies of supernova remnants offer a great deal of information .",
    "absorption spectra allow us to place limits on the distances to snrs , which lead to physical radii as well as age estimates .",
    "examination of related  emission structures may help us to understand why shell - type remnant morphology is dominated by loops and knots , in addition to diffuse emission .",
    "the morphology of snrs is undoubtedly related in some complicated way to the inhomogeneities in the ism into which they expand , as well as to non - uniform magnetic fields .",
    "one might expect snr continuum emission to trace the local ism in such a way that bright emission may be correlated with density enhancements exterior to the snr shell . in principle",
    "these ism density enhancements would be apparent as brightness temperature enhancements in the neutral hydrogen at velocities similar to the systemic velocity of the remnant .",

    "the continuum emission has a bright , sharply bounded rim to the lower left , while the emission on the upper right side is much more diffuse . if the limb brightening observed to the lower left is a consequence of the shock impacting a density enhancement , we might expect to see an  cloud exterior to the shell at the systemic velocity of the remnant .",
