    "there are also expected collective modes associated with this neutron skin , e.g. the `` scissors '' vibrational mode or the `` pygmy '' resonance . in proton - rich nuclei , we have recently seen both spherical and deformed proton emitters ; this `` proton radioactivity '' is caused by the tunneling of weakly bound protons through the coulomb barrier . with rib facilities ,",
    "nuclear theorists see an opportunity to study the effective n - n interaction at large isospin , as well as large pairing correlations .    it is generally acknowledged that an accurate treatment of the pairing interaction is essential for describing exotic nuclei @xcite .",

    "these features represent major challenges for the mean field theories .",
    "we overcome these difficulties by solving the hfb equations for deformed , axially symmetric even - even nuclei on a two - dimensional lattice , without any further approximations .",
