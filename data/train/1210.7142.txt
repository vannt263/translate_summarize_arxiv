    "<S> this paper presents an explanation of a possible mechanism underlying the shape of the universal curve of scaling law for earthquake recurrence time distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the presented simple stochastic cellular automaton model is reproducing the gamma distribution fit with the proper value of the parameter @xmath0 characterizing earth s seismicity and also imitates a deviation from the fit at the short interevent times , as observed in real data .    </S>",
    "<S> thus the model suggests an explanation of the universal pattern of rescaled earthquake recurrence time distributions in terms of combinatorial rules for accumulation and abrupt release of seismic energy .    analyzing seismic catalogs , </S>",
    "<S> corral @xcite has determined that the probability densities of the waiting times between earthquakes for different spatial areas and magnitude ranges can be described by a unique universal distribution if the time is rescaled with the mean rate of occurrence .    to unify diverse observations the spatiotemporal analysis </S>",
    "<S> was carried out as follows . </S>",
    "<S> seismicity is considered as result of a dynamical process in which collective properties are largely independent on the physics of the individual earthquakes . </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite , events are not separated into different kinds ( foreshocks , mainshocks , aftershocks ) nor the crust is divided into provinces with different tectonic properties . </S>",
    "<S> then , a region of the earth is selected , as well as temporal period and a minimum magnitude @xmath1 ( for conditions and other details see @xcite ) . events in this space - time - magnitude window are considered as a point process in time ( disregarding the magnitude and the spatial degrees of freedom ) and are characterized only by its occurrence time @xmath2 , with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> then the recurrence ( or waiting ) time @xmath4 is defined by @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the entire earth has been analyzed by this method and it appears that different regions probability densities of waiting times , rescaled by the mean seismic rate , as a function of the rescaled recurrence time collapse onto a single curve @xmath6 @xcite : @xmath7 where mean seismic rate @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 , ( here @xmath10 is a total time into consideration ) , and recurrence - time probability density @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 } /{\\tau}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the so called scaling function @xmath6 admits a fit in the form of a generalized gamma distribution @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is dimensionless recurrence time . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath19 can be approximated to @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the present characterization of the stochastic spatiotemporal occurrence of earthquakes by means of a unique law would indicate the existence of universal mechanisms in the earthquake - generation process @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents an explanation of a possible mechanism underlying the shape of the universal curve in terms of a cellular automaton model called random domino automaton ( rda ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simple rules for evolution of the model , being a slowly driven system , rely on accumulation and abrupt release of energy only , which fit well to the described above procedure of neglecting individual properties of earthquakes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that rda reproduces the rescaled distribution of recurrence times .    as can be seen from the original work @xcite as well as from further studies @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> results obtained from various earthquake catalogs show a deviation from the gamma distribution at the short interevent times . </S>",
    "<S> this holds from worldwide to local scales and for quite different tectonic environments .    </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that the presented model reproduces also this deviation . </S>",
    "<S> thus the model suggests an explanation of the universal pattern of rescaled earthquake recurrence time distributions in terms of its combinatorial rules for accumulation and release of seismic energy .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , some insight of the origin of the gamma distribution as well as examination the recurrence statistics of a range of cellular automaton earthquake models are presented in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown there , that only one model , the olami - feder - christensen automaton , has recurrence statistics consistent with regional seismicity for a certain range of conservation parameter of that model .    the random domino automaton ( rda ) was introduced as a toy model of earthquakes @xcite , but can be also regarded as an extension of well known 1-d forest - fire model proposed by drossel and schwabl @xcite . as a field of application of rda </S>",
    "<S> we have already studied its relation to ito equation @xcite and to integer sequences @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we point out also other cellular automata models @xcite giving an insight into diverse specific aspects of seismicity , including predictions .    </S>",
    "<S> .states of rda for the size of the lattice @xmath21 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     , the next is for sizes bigger then @xmath22 , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest curve counts only avalanches of size @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line is a plot of fitted gamma distribution @xmath24 ; the solid line below is a plot of fitted exponential curve @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> , width=302 ]    figure [ fig : n5lin2 ] presents obtained distributions of waiting times up to @xmath26 time steps . </S>",
    "<S> the upper curve is for avalanches of all sizes , the next is for avalanches of size bigger then @xmath20 , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest curve count avalanches of size @xmath23 only .    </S>",
    "<S> dashed line is a fitted gamma distribution @xmath24 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this fit is done for points with time coordinate from @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) . </S>",
    "<S> values of the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be rescaled , depending on their relation to physical quantities ( time , number of earthquakes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath0 is a fixed parameter , with exactly the same value which characterize earth s seismicity . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line below is a plot of fitted exponential curve @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the exponential part of the universal curve comes from distributions of biggest avalanches . in the presented example </S>",
    "<S> the biggest @xmath34 is for the state @xmath35 containing single cluster of size @xmath23 ( see table [ tab : tav ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus its contribution to the overall waiting time distribution dominates for bigger times ( compare formulas and ) . </S>",
    "<S> also state @xmath36 containing single cluster of size @xmath37 contribute , but it is decaying more rapidly .    </S>",
    "<S> the other part of the universal curve , comes from contributions of avalanches of smaller sizes . </S>",
    "<S> its shape is a result of composition of many possible paths of the evolution , depicted in figure [ fig : fig1 ] . for bigger sizes @xmath38 there are much more possible paths ( i.e. @xmath39 for @xmath40 ) through states containing many clusters with comparable times @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> their composition flatten the curve . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , calculation shows this effect produces a surplus ( comparing to the gamma fit ) for small waiting times , which is evident in real earthquakes data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the surplus can be reduced by omitting of a contribution of smallest avalanches ( also not recorded in real data ) .    </S>",
    "<S> note , that due to the incompleteness of the seismic catalogs in the short - time scale , usually real data are not displayed on plots for very short time intervals . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the obtained theoretical curve , shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] , may be similarly cut for small times . if it is done for time , say , smaller then @xmath41 , it reflects the shape of real data .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the presented model suggests that the origin of a universal curve is of combinatorial nature of accumulation and abrupt release of energy according to the rules depending on some parameters defining probabilities dependent on size of energy portions , as described above . </S>"
