    "the suppression of heavy quarkonium production in a quark - gluon plasma has been a subject of intense interest since the pioneering work of matsui and satz @xcite .",
    "initial insight into the dissociation temperatures of heavy quarkonium was further provided by karsch , mehr , and satz @xcite .",
    "recently , digal , petreczky , and satz @xcite reported theoretical results on the dissociation temperatures of heavy quarkonia in hadron and quark - gluon plasma phases .",
    "these are interesting results as they are related to the use of the suppression of heavy quarkonia production as a signal for the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the basic input of digal @xmath3 is the temperature dependence of the @xmath4-@xmath5 interaction as inferred from lattice gauge calculations @xcite .",
    "we can understand conceptually such a temperature dependence of the @xmath4-@xmath5 potential by placing @xmath4 and @xmath5 as an external source in a qcd medium . if the temperature of the medium is zero , the linear confining potential between @xmath4 and @xmath6 is the result of the alignment of the color electric fields at neighboring sites inside the flux tube , in analogy with the alignment of spins in a ferromagnet ( fig .",

    "( * fig.1@xmath9 * ) a possible configuration of the color electric field in a hot medium .",
    "many different configurations of the color electric fields are possible , with a distribution centered about the mean color electric field configuration which is aligning along the flux tube .",
    "4truemm    when the medium is at a high temperature , the gluon and light quark fields fluctuate and the alignment of the color electric fields due to the qcd interaction is reduced by the thermal motion for a random orientation of the color electric fields ( fig .",
    "1@xmath9 ) .",
    "the greater the temperature , the stronger the tendency for thermal disorientation , and the weaker the resultant linear interaction between @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "this tendency continues until deconfinement sets in at the phase transition temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the variation of the @xmath4-@xmath5 potential gives rise to three different modes of heavy quarkonium dissociation at high temperatures : ( 1 ) spontaneous dissociation , ( 2 ) dissociation by thermal thermalization , and ( 3 ) dissociation by collision with particles in the medium .",
    "we shall discuss them in turn .",
    "a heavy quarkonium dissociates spontaneously when the binding energy of the quarkonium relative to a pair of final open charm or open bottom mesons vanishes . utilizing the temperature - dependent potential for charmonia and bottomia",
    ", digal @xmath3 found that the dissociation temperatures for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 in units of @xmath10 are , respectively , @xmath14 , 0.74 , and 0.83 , while the dissociation temperatures for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath15 are above @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "even at @xmath8 a proper description of the heavy quarkonium state should be based on a screening potential @xcite , as the heavy quarkonium becomes a pair of open charm or open bottom mesons when @xmath16 becomes very large , due to the action of dynamical quark pairs .",
    "previously , a screening potential was obtained to provide a good description of charmonium bound states , resonances , and @xmath17 decay widths at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this screening potential can be used as the starting point for studying heavy quarkonia at high temperatures .",
    "using a potential different from that of digal @xmath3 @xcite will help us find out the sensitivity of the values of dissociation temperatures on the potentials .",
    "we would also like to include spin - dependent interactions .",
    "their inclusion is useful because they lead to a better description of the energy splittings of the quarkonium states which affect the dissociation temperatures .",
    "furthermore , these spin and angular momentum quantum numbers give rise to selection rules for the final meson states and alter the dissociation threshold energies and the dissociation temperatures .",
    "the @xmath4-@xmath5 potential at temperature @xmath18 refers to the situation of placing an external quarkonium ( at rest ) in a medium of temperature @xmath18 .",
    "the changes of the gluon and light quark fields between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 due to the temperature of the medium give rise to a change of the @xmath4-@xmath5 interaction and the subsequent change of the binding energy .",
    "the external quarkonium needs not be in thermal equilibrium with the medium .",
    "the quarkonium placed in a hot medium however will collide with particles in the medium and become thermalized .",
    "when the quarkonium reaches thermal equilibrium with the medium , the quarkonium will be in a mixed state whose occupation probabilities for the different energy levels will be distributed statistically according to the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "there is a finite probability for this system to populate states whose energies lie above their respective dissociation thresholds .",
    "this fraction of the quarkonium system above the thresholds will dissociate into open charm or open bottom mesons .",
    "dissociation of this type can be called dissociation by thermalization . because the binding energies of the quarkonium states decrease as temperature increases , the probability of dissociation by thermalization also increases as the temperature increases .",
    "finally , a heavy quarkonium can also be dissociated by collision with particles in the medium .",
    "the threshold energies and dissociation cross sections will be affected by the temperature dependence of the heavy quarkonium states .",
    "we would like to investigate how these dissociation cross sections depend on the temperature of the medium , using the quark - interchange model of barnes and swanson @xcite which has been applied successfully to many hadron - hadron @xcite and hadron-(heavy quarkonia ) reactions at @xmath8 @xcite .    in section",
