    "hydrostatic pressure is important in many research fields .",
    "the structural , physical and chemical properties of matter under pressure are of interest to physicists , chemists and materials scientists @xcite .",
    "hydrostatic pressure is also an important tool in elucidating the mechanisms underlying the assembly of protein and other macromolecular structures @xcite , while pressure effects on cartilage and bone cells are physiologically and medically important @xcite . from a technological point of view",
    ", moderate hydrostatic pressures ( @xmath0 200mpa ) have potential applications in protein manufacturing @xcite , while treatment with higher hydrostatic pressures ( @xmath3 600mpa ) can be used to kill microorganisms in food sterilization @xcite or surgical applications @xcite . finally",
    ", deep sea environments , which constitute a large part of the global biosphere , are exposed to hydrostatic pressures up to 101mpa .",
    "understanding how biological organisms adapt to such pressures is of both fundamental scientific and biotechnological interest @xcite .    in all of these contexts ,",
    "optical microscopy is a powerful tool .",
    "since depressurization before imaging constitutes a large and uncontrolled perturbation , it is a great advantage to be able to image a pressurized sample _ in situ _ at elevated pressure .",
    "however , microscope pressure cells are expensive and time - consuming to construct , and are often designed for a single application , making it difficult to use a particular system for multiple applications . in this paper , we report the development of a multipurpose microscope pressure - cell system , in which different modules can be interchanged to allow for different requirements in terms of microscopy technique , solvent tolerance , optical resolution and pressure range . the system can be used with a conventional epifluorescence , transmission or confocal microscope ,",
    "has a large sample volume of @xmath0100@xmath1l , is temperature controlled and is capable of rapid and well - controlled pressure ramping or quenching .",
    "our focus is on biological and soft - matter physics applications in the pressure range @xmath4mpa .    a microscope pressure cell suitable for biological and soft - matter applications must have a large sample volume ( @xmath0 100@xmath1l ) , in order to be able to observe `` bulk - like '' material or cellular behaviour .",
    "the pressure cell must also be compact and light enough to fit on a standard microscope stage .",
    "the cell must have optical windows which can sustain pressure .",
    "however , good optical resolution requires the working distance between the objective lens and the sample to be as small as possible",
    ". the window should therefore be as thin as possible and the window aperture as wide as possible to allow close approach of the objective to the window .",
    "one would also like to achieve well - controlled and rapid pressure quenching and temperature control .",
    "a number of pressure cells have been reported for imaging at moderate hydrostatic pressure ; the properties of a representative sample of these are summarized in table [ tab : cells ] . at higher pressures ( several gpa ) , diamond anvil cells @xcite",
    "are widely used ; their small sample volume and thick diamond windows make them generally unsuitable for high resolution imaging of biological and soft matter samples under moderate pressures , although modified diamond anvil cells for imaging biological samples of small volume have been developed @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     although the cells listed in table [ tab : cells ] represent a wide range of capabilities , each is designed for a specific application .",
    "our aim was to develop a modular and multipurpose system , allowing for high - resolution high - pressure microscopy over a range of pressures up to  700mpa , suitable for users in a variety of research fields . given the expense and technical difficulty associated with the construction of a pressure cell , such a multi - purpose system should significantly facilitate high - pressure research . in section",
    "[ sec : des ] of this paper , we describe our system in detail . in section",
    "[ sec : cal ] we discuss calibration and optical testing . in sections",
    "[ sec : colloids ] and [ sec : bacteria ] , we demonstrate the system by presenting data on the kinetics of a pressure quench - induced colloidal phase transition and high - resolution imaging of bacteria growing under pressure",
    ". finally , we present our conclusions in section [ sec : concs ] .",
    "+    figures [ fig : diag](a ) illustrates the design of our pressure cell system , a photograph of which is shown in figure [ fig : diag](b ) .",
    "dimensions are given in table [ tab : dims ] .",
    "the system consists of two basic parts : the pressure cell and the pressurizing ram .",
    "each of these parts has an associated piston .",
    "the pressure cell , of diameter 35 mm , contains the sample chamber [ diameter 4.5 mm ] , which has a window aperture of diameter 1.5 mm .",
    "a piston of diameter 4.5 mm fits into the cell .",
    "the pressure cell is screwed into the ram , in such a way that the ram piston exerts pressure on the pressure - cell piston when hydraulic fluid is pumped into the ram .",
    "brake fluid is used as the hydraulic fluid of choice , particularly for rapid quenching , due to its low compressibility and temperature - independent properties .",

    "this heat treatment also causes the metal surface to darken , reducing the reflection of light inside the cell .",
    "the pressure cell window is made of either 0.5 mm thick type 2a gem quality diamond ( element 6 , cuijk , the netherlands ) or 0.45 mm optical quality quartz ( uqg optics ) .",
    "the window is attached to the optically flat surface by a poulter - type seal and fixed at 180@xmath2c with chemically resistant adhesive ( mbond ) .",
    "the pressure cell piston is made of timetal 550 , machined and heat treated as described above .",
    "sealing rings are made of polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ) for low pressure sealing ( up to 200mpa ) and phosphorbronze plus ptfe for high pressure sealing ( up to 700mpa ) . for transmitted light microscopy",
    ", we have made a version of the pressure cell piston which is hollow and contains a 0.5 mm thick diamond window , fixed using a poulter - type seal as described above .",
    "light can pass into the cell through this window , when used in conjunction with a hollow version of the ram piston .",
    "the ram is made of w-720 tool steel ( bhler uk ) , fitted to standard hydraulic connectors , and the ram piston uses single or dual o - ring seals ( solid and hollow versions respectively ) .    we have constructed multiple versions of both the ram and the pressure cell .",
    "these have different functionalities and can be combined in a modular fashion .",
    "the hollow version of the ram contains a hollow piston , and is suitable for transmitted light microscopy .",
    "an alternative , solid , ram contains instead a solid piston .",
    "the solid ram has a simpler and more rugged design , making it more suited to higher pressures .",
    "pressure cell 1 is designed for pressures up to 700mpa and has a diamond window of thickness 0.5 mm .",
    "this cell allows for a working distance of 4 mm and is compatible with a commercial 20@xmath5 extra long working distance ( elwd ) objective ( nikon ; working distance : 8.1 - 7.0 mm , na : 0.45 ) .",
    "pressure cell 2 is designed for higher resolution at pressures up to  100mpa .",
    "this cell has a quartz window of thickness 0.45 mm , with a more open window surround , and can achieve a working distance of 1.4 mm , making it compatible with a 60@xmath5 elwd objective ( nikon ; working distance : 1.5 - 2.1 mm , na : 0.70 ) .",
    "the pressure cells can be used in combination with either of two pressure cell pistons : a hollow piston containing a diamond window , which is suitable for transmitted light imaging , and a more rugged solid piston .",
    "in the higher pressure range ( 200 - 700mpa ) , the ruby fluorescence technique ( r1 line ) was used for calibration @xcite .",
    "a tiny crystal of natural ruby was attached to the inside of the diamond window with transparent araldite and the cell was filled with water .",
    "temperature was controlled at 26.0@xmath60.1@xmath2c .",
    "a neon bulb was used to provide a calibration reference line , in near coincidence with the r2 ruby line . a coderg triple 800 spectrometer set for high resolution ( 0.33@xmath7 ) , with steps of 0.125@xmath7 , was used to obtain ruby spectra at different pressures , and the best fit to a lorentzian lineshape was used to obtain the position of the r1 ruby line , relative to the neon reference , allowing the pressure inside the cell to be determined .",
    "a high resolution spectrometer is required because the magnitude of the r1 shift is very small .",
    "results for pressure cell 1 are shown in figure [ fig : cal](a ) .",
    "the calibration was done with an enarpac bourdon gauge with a scale reading to 40 mpa , with the fluorescence wavelength shift taken as 7.68 @xmath7 / gpa .",
    "+      in the lower pressure range ( below 200mpa ) , a liquid crystal calibration method was used .",
    "this provides a remarkably simple yet accurate method of calibration which requires only accurate temperature control .",
    "the method involves observing the nematic to isotropic phase transition of pentyl - cyanobiphenyl ( 5cb ) as the cell is heated in stages through the transition into the isotropic phase . the transition pressure in the cell",
    "can then be calculated from the formula derived by shashidhar and ventkatesh @xcite for 5cb : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the temperature above the ambient pressure transition temperature ( in centigrade ) and p is in kbar ( 1kbar@xmath11101mpa ) .",
    "ram pressure is then gradually applied until the nematic phase is restored . by slowly reducing the ram pressure until the transition reverses",
    ", a measurement of the hysteresis of the cell at that pressure is obtained .    to observe the transition ,",
    "about 2 to 3 mm depth of neat 5cb was placed in the cell and sealed with the light transmitting ( hollow ) pressure cell piston .",
    "a small amount of laser light passed through the cell and was observed on a screen . as pressure was applied , the laser spot shimmered just before the transition before being abruptly extinguished at the transition .",
    "after about 30 seconds a much weaker spot appeared on the screen with a polarisation generally different to the laser polarisation . on slowly releasing the ram pressure ,",
    "the spot shimmered and then became much brighter as the transition reversed .",
    "although a laser was used in this calibration , it is not essential : the transition can be observed quite easily with ordinary light .",
    "as the cell pressure is derived directly from the temperature , a cheap low accuracy bourdon gauge is sufficient for the ram pressure measurement , as long as the calibration curve is re - measured for each gauge .",
    "figure [ fig : cal](b ) shows a 5cb calibration of pressure cell 1 .",
    "the ram pressure was measured with a small 10mpa r.s .",
    "bourdon gauge .",
    "figure [ fig : cal](a ) ( triangles ) shows the same data , with the vertical axis translated into the cell pressure using eq.([eq : sv ] ) .",
    "the solid line shows the expected pressure in the cell if the seals were 100% efficient and had zero friction .",
    "both the 5cb and ruby calibrations in figure [ fig : cal](a ) show straight lines with very little hysteresis .",
    "the gradient of the line for the 5cb calibration is slightly lower than that for the ruby calibration , suggesting that the 10mpa gauge was slightly overestimating the ram pressure with respect to the 40mpa gauge .",
    "this was later confirmed in a separate measurement .",
    "we note that the 5cb calibration method could be extended to higher pressures for pressure cells which can withstand very high temperatures .",
    "to evaluate the optical resolution of our two pressure cells , we imaged 3@xmath1 m fluorescent beads ( sigma - aldrich ) in a nikon / bio - rad confocal microscope with a 488 nm laser .",
    "figure 3 shows horizontal ( a and b ) and vertical ( c and d ) section images of a single bead , averaged over 8 frames and corrected for the sample medium @xcite .",
    "while we are able to resolve single beads in both pressure cells , significantly better resolution is achieved with cell 2 .     +",
    "hydrostatic pressure can be used in colloid science to modify interactions , change the relative composition of multi - component samples ( if the components have different compressibilities ) and to reach new nonequilibrium states by rapid quenching .",
    "for example , the effect of pressure on hydrophobic interactions has been explored experimentally for proteins @xcite and polymers @xcite and via simulations for proteins and hydrophobic solutes @xcite .",
    "other researchers have used hydrostatic pressure to investigate the phase diagram of a system of adhesive colloids @xcite and to adjust the volume fraction of a sample of colloidal rods , leading to a transition from the isotropic phase into the nematic phase @xcite .",
    "these studies involved slow changes of pressure , but it is possible to achieve pressure changes at the speed of sound , significantly faster than changes of temperature .",
    "pressure therefore presents promising possibilities for experiments requiring fast quench rates .",
    "for example , the kinetics of relaxation to equilibrium in binary fluids have been investigated using rapid pressure quenches combined with light scattering @xcite .",
    "our interest is in the spatial structure of binary fluids undergoing a phase separation which is arrested by the jamming of colloidal particles at the fluid interfaces @xcite .",
    "these systems are highly heterogeneous , making fluorescence confocal microscopy the technique of choice . here",
    ", we present data obtained using pressure cell 1 ( which has a 0.5 mm thick diamond window ) , in combination with fluorescence confocal microscopy with a 20@xmath5 elwd objective , for both slow and rapid pressure quenches .",
    "figure [ fig : col1 ] shows a series of images of a binary fluid of water and 2,6-lutidine containing colloidal silica particles , as it undergoes a slow change in pressure from 0.1mpa to 101mpa .",
    "the interfaces between the liquid phases are stabilized by the colloidal silica ( this is a particle - stabilized emulsion @xcite ) .",
    "the silica is dyed using the fluorescent dye fitc and a small fraction of the silica particles are dispersed in the continuous phase of the emulsion .",
    "the use of fluorescence facilitates imaging deeper into the sample . at the start of the experiment",
    "the binary fluid sample is under conditions ( 37@xmath2c , atmospheric pressure ) where the two liquids are demixed .",
    "on increasing the pressure the liquids begin to remix  reducing the interfacial tension and hence releasing some of the particles trapped at the interface .",
    "the particles are pushed into close contact as the emulsion is destroyed , resulting in some residual clustering in the final frame , even though by this frame the liquids are completely demixed .",
    "we next demonstrate the use of pressure cell 1 for a rapid pressure quench experiment on the water , 2,6-lutidine , colloidal silica system . here , we start the experiment in the single - fluid region of the phase diagram where the two liquids are mixed ( 101 mpa and 35@xmath2c , achieved by first pressurising then warming the sample ) . at this temperature and at atmospheric pressure",
    "the liquids would be in the demixed , two - fluid phase .",
    "we can therefore observe the demixing transition by rapidly releasing the pressure ; this is achieved by dumping the pressurising brake fluid out of the ram through a solenoid valve .",
    "the confocal microscopy images captured during the pressure quench experiment are shown as a time sequence in figure [ fig : col2 ] . since the images are formed by scanning a laser , time progresses both between frames ( left to right ) and from the top to the bottom of a frame . the first frame in figure [ fig : col2 ]",
    "shows a dispersion of particles in the single - fluid phase .",
    "the brake fluid is released while the laser is scanning the second frame and this induces a rapid phase separation : a dramatic change in the sample properties occurs over the scanning of five horizontal lines . by the third frame",
    ", the phase separation is well developed ; the colloidal particles partition into one of the phases which appears brighter than the other .",
    "this series of images can be used to estimate the speed of the pressure quench : since the phase transition occurs within the scanning of five lines ( at 500 lines per second ) , we estimate that the quench occurs in 10 ms .",
    "we note that the sudden change in pressure under adiabatic conditions results in a concomitant change in the temperature @xcite  we verified that this change in temperature did not itself cause a phase transition .",
    "+    hydrostatic pressure is of interest in microbiology in several contexts . understanding how deep sea microorganisms have evolved to tolerate and even require pressure @xcite has potential applications in biotechnology as well as marine ecology .",
    "applying pressure to non - pressure - adapted microorganisms is also of interest , both as a means of food sterilisation @xcite and in the general context of microbial stress response @xcite . in all these areas ,",
    "the ability to image microorganisms in a pressurised microscope cell can provide powerful insights .",
    "for example , microscopy can reveal pressure effects on dna configuration @xcite or protein localisation @xcite within the cell .",
    "a microscopic approach also allows one to detect heterogeneity among the cellular population ( which is believed to be an important factor in survival of environmental stresses @xcite ) , and to measure single - cell properties such as swimming speeds @xcite .",
    "+    here , we demonstrate that our system can be used to monitor pressure - associated morphological changes in the bacterium _",
    "escherichia coli_. _ e. coli _ is a non - pressure - adapted organism whose cells are rod - shaped and of typical size 1@xmath52@xmath1 m when growing exponentially at atmospheric pressure .",
    "the morphological response of _",
    "e. coli _ to pressure is well documented .",
    "the details are strain - dependent , but a general picture is that when exposed to pressures up to @xmath025mpa , _",
    "e. coli _ cells continue to grow and divide , but become somewhat elongated compared to those grown at atmospheric pressure @xcite . at higher pressures , in the range 30 - 50mpa",
    ", cell division is inhibited , leading to filamentous growth @xcite , while growth is abolished altogether above @xmath060mpa @xcite .",
    "exposure to pressures above @xmath0150mpa leads to cell death : microscopic studies of _ e. coli _ after short - term exposure to such pressures have reported filamentation @xcite , aggregation of cytoplasmic proteins @xcite and nucleoid condensation @xcite .    here",
    ", we present transmitted light images of _ e. coli _ cells growing at 50mpa , obtained using pressure cell 2 on an inverted nikon ti - u microscope with a 60@xmath5 elwd objective .",
    "we compare the behaviour of two _ e. coli _ strains : the wild - type strain mg1655 and strain bw25113@xmath12_lon _",
    "@xcite which is unable to produce the lon protease enzyme .",
    "figure [ fig : bact1 ] shows _",
    "e. coli _ mg1655 cells growing at 50mpa , 120 minutes ( a ) , 620 minutes ( b ) and 20 hours ( c ) after pressurisation . the experimental protocol is given in the caption .",
    "filamentation is clearly apparent ( whereas the same strain grown in the pressure cell at 0.1mpa shows no filamentation ; data not shown ) .",
    "interestingly , the population is heterogeneous : there is variability in length among those cells that do filament and some cells apparently do not filament at all .",
    "we have observed motility of some of these non - filamented cells even after 20 hours growth at 50mpa .",
    "a distribution in lengths among filamentous cells grown under pressure has been noted before @xcite , but to our knowledge this variability has not been studied in detail .",
    "figure [ fig : bact2 ] shows equivalent images for the mutant bw25113@xmath12_lon _",
    "@xcite , which is unable to produce the lon protease .",
    "this strain , like mg1655 , is able to divide normally when grown at 0.1mpa , but produces filaments when grown at 50mpa .",
    "however , in contrast to mg1655 , the _ lon _ mutant population appears to filament homogeneously , with fewer unfilamented cells being visible .",
    "previous work by aertsen and michiels has shown that _",
    "mutants display hyperfilamentation after brief periods of pressurisation at 100mpa , and that this is due to activation of the sos response pathway @xcite .",
    "interestingly , however , previous work characterising changes in the _ e. coli _ protein @xcite and mrna @xcite composition during growth at @xmath050mpa has not shown activation of the sos pathway .",
    "we plan to carry out a more detailed study of the factors governing filamentation at 50mpa in bw25113@xmath12_lon _ versus mg1655 in future work .",
    "in this paper , we have described a microscope pressure cell system with a modular design , in which parts can be interchanged to allow for a wide range of applications .",
    "our system consists of a pressurized cell and piston , a ram with associated piston , and a temperature - controlled holder .",
    "we have designed two versions of the pressurized cell , suitable for pressures in the ranges 0.1 - 700mpa ( cell 1 ) and 0.1 - 200mpa ( cell 2 ) .",
    "we have also developed two versions of the pressure cell piston , one hollow , to allow for transmitted light imaging , and the other solid and more rugged in design , and the ram has been constructed in both hollow and solid versions .",
    "the system was calibrated using the ruby fluorescence technique for pressures in the range 200 - 700mpa , and using a method based on the isotropic - nematic transition of the liquid crystal 5cb in the pressure range 0.1 - 200mpa .",
    "the latter proved a very simple and convenient calibration method .",
    "we have demonstrated our pressure cell system for two different applications . our first application was in colloid science . here , we used pressure cell 1 to image phase separation in a binary fluid in which the fluid - fluid interfaces are coated with fluorescent colloidal particles .",
    "we observed remixing of a phase separated binary fluid as pressure was slowly increased , as well as sudden demixing of a mixed sample on rapid pressure quenching from 101mpa to 0.1mpa .",
    "our second application was in microbiology . here , we used pressure cell 2 to obtain high resolution images of the growth of _ escherichia coli _ bacteria at 50mpa .",
    "we compared the behaviour of two _ e. coli _ strains : the wild - type strain mg1655 and strain bw25113@xmath12_lon _ , which is unable to produce the lon protease enzyme .",
    "we observed heterogeneous filamentation of _",
    "mg1655 at 50mpa , with marked variability among individual cells in the population .",
    "in contrast , the _ lon _ mutant bw25113@xmath12_lon _ , which is hypersensitive to pressure @xcite , showed more uniform filamentation across the population .",
    "we plan to use this pressure cell system for further studies in both colloid science and microbiology .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the effects of pressure on the interactions between hydrophobic colloids , as models for protein complexation and aggregation , in further characterising the factors governing _ e. coli _ filamentation in response to pressure at the single cell level , and in visualising bacterial gene regulatory responses to pressure , using fluorescent reporter proteins",
    ". other applications for this system could include using pressure to trigger phase transitions in complex fluids ( as illustrated here for a binary fluid ) , single cell imaging of microbial killing using short bursts of high pressure and imaging of calcium signalling in mammalian cartilage cells in response to pressure stimuli . because our system is designed in a modular way , it can easily be augmented with new components as they become necessary for new applications .",
    "components currently under development for use with this system include an additional pressure cell capable of achieving even higher pressures , a very high resolution cell for use at lower pressures , a module to allow for injection of liquids into the cell under pressure and a `` flow through '' module which would allow continuous perfusion of liquid through the pressurised cell .",
