    "is a @xmath148 ms radio pulsar located in an eccentric ( e@xmath10.87 ) , 3.4 year orbit with a be star ss 2883 @xcite .",
    "this system is known to be highly variable on an orbital time scale in radio ( @xcite and references therein ) , x - ray ( @xcite and references therein ) , and tev @xcite energy ranges .",
    "the orbital multi - wavelength variability pattern is determined by the details of the interaction of a relativistic pulsar wind with a strongly anisotropic wind of the companion be star , composed of a fast , rarefied polar wind and a slow , dense equatorial decretion disk .",
    "the disk of the be star in the  system is believed to be tilted with respect to the orbital plane . while the inclination of the disk is not constrained ,",
    "the line of intersection of the disk plane and the orbital plane is known to be oriented at about @xmath2  with respect to the major axis of the binary orbit @xcite and the pulsar passes through the disk twice per orbit .",
    "the unpulsed radio emission from the system appears approximately at the moment of the pre - periastron entrance of the pulsar into the equatorial be star disk . within several days",
    "unpulsed radio emission sharply rises to a peak , and then slightly decreases , as the pulsar passes through periastron .",
    "the second peak is reached during the second , post - periastron disk crossing @xcite .",
    "observations of the  system in 1994 and 1995 have shown that , similar to the radio light curve , the x - ray light curve has two peaks around the periastron @xcite .",
    "the  observations of the source s orbital x - ray light curve , with a detailed monitoring of the period when pulsar approaches and enters the dense equatorial wind of the be - star prior to periastron , have shown that the appearance of the unpulsed radio emission is also accompanied by a sharp rise of the x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "the source spectral evolution has revealed an unexpected hardening of the source spectrum with the smallest value of the photon index @xmath3 , and a subsequent softening on the day scale as the pulsar moves deeper inside the disk .",
    "unfortunately , in 2004 the source became invisible for  just after the entrance to the disk , so that the behaviour of the source within the disk and during the second disk crossing remained unclear . in order to clarify this behaviour , we organised an intensive x - ray monitoring campaign during the 2007 periastron passage .",
    "we have monitored the source with the , ,  and  satellites during a @xmath4  months period , which covers both the pre- and post - periastron disk crossings . the results of this campaign are discussed below .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the details of the data analysis .",
    "the results are presented in section 3 , and discussed in section 4 .",

    "such short time scale variability could be related to the clumpy structure of the wind of the be star @xcite .",

    "to study the details of variability at the @xmath27  ks time scale , we arranged a long @xmath34  ks continuous exposure during the observation x12 .",

    "the 2007 observational campaign confirms the previous finding @xcite that during the first , pre - periastron passage of the disk , the x - ray spectrum of the source hardens on a day scale reaching a value of the photon index smaller than 1.5 . during the 2004 periastron passage , a spectral state with photon index @xmath42",
    "was observed at the beginning of the rapid growth of the x - ray flux at the disk entrance ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "remarkable , the time of the subsequent spectral softening coincided with the time of a step - like increase of the hydrogen column density ( @xmath44 ) , which can be related to the penetration of the pulsar in the dense equatorial disk .",
    "the observed hardening , along with the successive softening and sharp flux rise , was attributed by @xcite to the injection of high energy electrons at the disk entrance ( e.g. due to the proton - proton collisions ) , or to a sharp decrease of the high energy electron s escape velocity accompanied with the modification of their spectrum by coulomb losses .",
    "an alternative explanation of the hard x - ray spectrum observed at the disk entrance is possible within a model in which x - ray emission is produced via the synchrotron mechanism @xcite . in this case",
    "hardening of the spectrum to photon indexes @xmath45 on a day time scale can be achieved if the electron energy loss is dominated by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering losses in the klein - nishina regime @xcite .",
    "the klein - nishina regime of ic scattering becomes important at energies above @xmath46  gev , where @xmath47 is the temperature of the be star .",
    "decrease of the ic cross - section at high energies leads to the decrease of the efficiency of the ic cooling of electrons and , as a result , to the hardening of the electron spectrum .",
    "electrons with a power law energy distribution @xmath48 cooled in the klein - nishina regime form a spectrum @xmath49^{-1}$ ] , much harder than @xmath50 in thompson limit @xcite . thus the resulting synchrotron spectrum is proportional to @xmath51 and can be harder than 1.5 .",
    "the 2007 data did not cover the period of the entrance to the disk , so it is not possible to check if the spectral hardening preceeding the flux growth repeats from orbit to orbit .",
    "instead , the photon index @xmath52 was observed in 2007 at almost the maximum of the x - ray flare associated to the pre - periastron disk passage .",
    "more precisely , the time of the hardening and subsequent softening of the spectrum in the 2007 data coincides with a local `` dip '' in the x - ray light curve during the broad flare associated to the disk passage .",
    "no strong variations of the hydrogen column density are noticeable at the moment of the hardening of the spectrum .",
    "detection of the spectral break in the x - ray spectrum of the source at @xmath53  kev in _ suzaku _ observation , which reveals the hard state with @xmath52 @xcite , provides an additional clue for the understanding of the nature of the observed spectral hardening .",
    "these two models of spectral hardening could be readily distinguished via multi - wavelength observations . in the case of the ic mechanism of the x - ray emission ,",
    "the energies of electrons responsible for the x - ray emission are in the range of @xmath27  mev , while in the synchrotron model the x - ray emitting electrons have multi - tev energies .",
    "a necessary condition for the hardening of the spectrum beyond @xmath54 in the synchrotron model is that the energy losses of multi - tev electrons are dominated by the ic loss .",
    "this means that the expected tev - band ic luminosity of the source at the moment of the spectral hardening is larger than the x - ray luminosity .",
    "unfortunately , the absence of the tev observations simultaneous with the x - ray observations in 2007 does not allow us to distinguish between the two models .",
    "if the hard x - ray spectrum can be explained by coulomb losses of the @xmath55  mev electrons , then the break at the @xmath56  kev energy , observed by suzaku , has to be ascribed to the so - called `` coulomb '' break in the electron spectrum .",
    "such a break appears at the energy @xmath57 , at which the rate of the coulomb energy loss is equal to the ic energy loss rate : @xmath58\\left[n_e/10^{8}\\mbox{cm}^{-3}\\right]^{1/2}\\mbox { mev}$ ] , where @xmath59 is the stellar wind density at a distance @xmath60 ( 10@xmath61 cm is a characteristic separation of the companions at orbital phases close to periastron ) .",

    "measurement of the break in the x - ray spectrum of the source enables an estimate of the density of the medium @xmath63 this estimate is consistent with the one expected for an equatorial disk with the radial density profile @xmath64 if the disk density close to the surface of the star is @xmath65  @xmath66 .",

    "indeed , the ic cooling time of the x - ray emitting electrons of the energy @xmath68 is @xmath69\\left[\\frac{d}{10^{13}\\mbox{cm}}\\right]^2\\left[\\frac{10\\mbox{mev}}{e_e}\\right ] \\mbox s\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the luminosity of the be star , @xmath71 is the electron mass and @xmath72 is the thomson cross - section .",
    "the ic cooling time is comparable to the escape time @xmath73\\left[v/10 ^ 7\\mbox { cm / s}\\right]\\mbox { s}$ ] if the escape velocity is @xmath74  cm / s .",
    "if the ic emitting electrons are initially injected at energies much larger than 10  mev ( e.g. as a result of the proton - proton interactions , @xcite ) , they would not be able to cool to energies below @xmath27  mev , which can explain the deficiency of the ic emission at the energies below the @xmath75  kev break energy .",
    "finally , the shape of electron spectrum below 10  mev can be also affected by adiabatic cooling . equating the adiabatic cooling rate @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the radius of the synchrotron / ic emitting bubble and @xmath78 is the escape velocity , to the ic cooling rate , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the radiation energy density , one finds the adiabatic break energy @xmath81\\left[\\frac{v}{10 ^ 7\\mbox { cm / s}}\\right]\\left[\\frac{l_\\star}{10^{38}\\mbox { erg / s}}\\right]^{-1}\\mbox { ev}\\ ] ] if the emission is produced at the distances @xmath82  cm , the observation of the cooling break at the energy @xmath83  kev is consistent with the assumption that the break is produced by the influence of the adiabatic losses if the escape velocity is @xmath74  cm / s , which is in agreement with the estimates of the velocity of the stellar wind in the considered range of distances @xcite .    the results of numerical modeling of the broad band spectrum of the source within the ic scenario of the x - ray emission are shown in fig .",

    "the observation of the hardening of the spectrum below @xmath54 during the pre - periastron disk passage gives an important clue about the x - ray emission mechanism .",

    "on the other hand , in the case of synchrotron origin of the observed x - rays , the spectral hardening can be produced if the electron cooling is dominated by the ic energy loss in the klein - nishina regime .",

    "<S> is a 48 ms radio pulsar in a highly eccentric 3.4 year orbit with a be star ss 2883 . </S>",
    "<S> unpulsed @xmath0-ray , x - ray and radio emission components are observed from the binary system . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the collision of the pulsar wind with the anisotropic wind of the be star plays a crucial role in the generation of the observed non - thermal emission . </S>",
    "<S> the 2007 periastron passage was observed in unprecedented details with , ,  and  missions . </S>",
    "<S> we present here the results of this campaign and compare them with previous observations . with these data we are able , for the first time , to study the details of the spectral evolution of the source over a 2 months period of the passage of the pulsar close to the be star . </S>",
    "<S> new data confirm the pre - periastron spectral hardening , with the photon index reaching a value smaller than 1.5 , observed during a local flux minimum . </S>",
    "<S> if the observed x - ray emission is due to the inverse compton ( ic ) losses of the 10 mev electrons , then such a hard spectrum can be a result of coulomb losses , or can be related to the existence of the low - energy cut - off in the electron spectrum . alternatively , </S>",
    "<S> if the x - ray emission is a synchrotron emission of very high energy electrons , the observed hard spectrum can be explained if the high energy electrons are cooled by ic emission in klein - nishina regime . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately the lack of simultaneous data in the tev energy band prevents us from making a definite conclusion on the nature of the observed spectral hardening and , therefore , on the origin of the x - ray emission .    </S>",
