    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) is a protocol to share the secret key between two authenticate parties ( alice and bob ) with negligible leakage of its information to an eavesdropper ( eve ) .",
    "the advantage of employing qkd is that it can achieve the unconditional security , which is the security against any possible attack allowed by the law of quantum mechanics under some assumptions on the devices used by alice and bob .",
    "the first qkd protocol was proposed by bennett and brassard at 1984 @xcite ( the protocol is called bb84 protocol ) . since this proposal ,",
    "many works have been devoted to prove the unconditional security @xcite , and some works take into account practical imperfections of the devices used by alice and bob @xcite .",
    "it is important that a mathematical model of alice and bob s devices is needed to prove the security of a qkd protocol , and thus the model should reflect the actual imperfections of the devices for the realization .    in this paper , we consider the effect of the losses in phase modulators and the unbalance in the transmission rate of beam splitters in the phase encoded bb84 .",
    "this practical imperfection is firstly pointed out by ferenczi , _ et .",
    "@xcite , and this scheme is referred to as the unbalanced bb84 .",
    "since the actual phase modulators have inevitable losses and the transmission rate of actual beam splitters can not be exactly 50% , it is important to analyze the security of the protocol in order to fit the theory to the actual situation .",
    "the security of this protocol has been analyzed by ferenczi , _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite based on the security proof @xcite . in their proof , however , it is not clear whether blindly applying the post - processing for the standard ( balanced ) bb84 would lead to an insecure key or not .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide the unconditional security proof of the unbalanced bb84 by showing that any security proof of the balanced bb84 where eve is allowed to distribute alice and bob a basis - independent state , for instance the security proof based on complementary scenario @xcite or shor - preskill type proof @xcite , can be directly applied to the unbalanced bb84 .",
    "this means that we can safely perform the data processing for the key distillation as if there were no unbalance and the unbalance only changes experimental data .",
    "moreover , a natural consequence of our security proof is that as long as the unbalances are basis - independent , our conclusion holds even if the unbalance in alice and bob is unknown and fluctuate in time .",
    "in order to see the performance of the unbalanced bb84 , we simulate the resulting key generation rate as a function of the distance between alice and bob . following the work by ferenczi , _ et .",
    "al . _ , we consider two cases : the first case is that we employ the unbalanced bb84 as it is and the second one is that we apply additional attenuations to alice and bob s devices in order to balance the intensities of the double pulses and to eliminate the effect of the unbalance in bob s measurement .",
    "we call the second case as the bb84 with the hardware fix or the hardware fix scenario , and this case is essentially the same as standard bb84 with additional losses . by simulating the key generation rates for the two cases , we have obtained almost the same threshold distance of the key generation in @xcite and confirmed that the key rate of the bb84 with the hardware fix is lower than that of the unbalanced bb84 @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows , in sec .",
    "[ protocol ] , we briefly review the protocol of the unbalanced bb84 . in sec .",
    "[ security proof ] , we first briefly review the security proof of the balanced bb84 and prove the unconditional security of the unbalanced bb84 . in sec .",
    "[ simulation ] , by assuming the use of the decoy state @xcite , we simulate the key generation rates of the unbalanced bb84 and the bb84 with the hardware fix .",
    "the key rates are plotted as a function of the distance between alice and bob by taking experimental data from gys experiment @xcite .",
    "finally , we summarize this paper in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce the unbalanced bb84 .",
    "the experimental setup of the unbalanced bb84 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ composition ] .",
    "the unbalanced bb84 is the standard phase encoded bb84 protocol using phase randomized weak coherent pulses where the intensities of the double pulses are not the same because of the imperfections of the phase modulators and/or the beam splitters . for the simplicity of the discussion , we assume that the phase modulators possessed by alice and bob have the same transmission rate @xmath0 and we do not explicitly consider the unbalance of the beam splitters , i.e. , all the relevant beam splitters are assumed to have 50% of transmission rate , but the generalization of our analysis is trivial .    in alice",
    "s side , a phase randomized coherent pulse from her laser source splits into two arms a1 and a2 by a balanced beam splitter bs1 .",
    "alice randomly applies phase modulation @xmath1 to the pulse passing a1 by the imperfect phase modulator pma . here",
    ", the phase @xmath2 is defined as the bit value @xmath3 in @xmath4 basis ( for the later convenience , we use @xmath5 to refer the basis ) . the pair of the pluses come from a1 and a2 is sent to bob via another balanced beam splitter bs2 .",
    "because of the imperfection of pma , the state of the pulses sent by alice becomes @xmath6 , where subscripts s and r respectively denote the signal pulse passed through a1 and reference pulse passed through a2 , and @xmath7 is the random phase chosen between 0 and @xmath8 .    .",
    "note that our proof is valid even if the unbalances in alice and bob s sides are different and unknown . ]    in bob s side , the optical length difference between b1 and b2 is adjusted to the same as the one between a1 and a2 .",
    "thanks to his interferometer , the pair of the incoming pulses is finally separated into three pulses which can be distinguished by the detection time of the detectors , and we only consider the pulses arriving at the intermediate time .",
    "bob applies the phase modulation @xmath9 randomly chosen from @xmath10 to the pulse passing through b1 by the imperfect phase modulator pmb . here , the phase modulation @xmath11 is defined as @xmath4 basis in bob s measurement . as the result of bob s phase modulation ,",
    "the state of the pulses arriving at the beam splitter bs4 becomes @xmath12 , and state at the detector d0  ( d1 ) becomes @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "bob records the bit value 0  ( 1 ) when d0  ( d1 ) clicks , and bob randomly assigns a random bit to the double click event if the double click event occurs due to noises such as the dark counting of the detectors or misalignment . after bob s measurement",
    ", bob broadcasts his basis , and alice and bob keep the data with the bases matched .",
    "one can see that bob can obtain the same bit value with alice when there are no noises .",
    "we note that we make the following assumption on bob s detection device : the povm element @xmath15 corresponding to the failure detection of the bit value in @xmath16 basis is basis - independent , i.e. , @xmath17 therefore , we consider bob s @xmath16 basis measurement is constructed by a basis - independent filter @xmath18 followed by bob s two - outcome , i.e. , bob s bit value , @xmath16 basis measurement @xmath19 .",
    "we note that the squash model @xcite is not necessary in our proof .",
    "we remark that since each of the signal and reference pulses of our interest passes through the phase modulator only once , we do not need to equalize the intensities of the pulses in order to suppress the bit errors .",
    "however , just for the comparison , we consider the case where we fix the unbalance by implementing the beam splitters with the transmission rate of @xmath0 to the paths of a2 and b2 ( see also fig .",
    "[ fix ] ) .",
    "we call this scenario as the bb84 with hardware fix or the hardware fix scenario , and we can regard this case as the ideal bb84 with the additional attenuation",
    ". we will compare the key generation rates of both of the cases by the key generation simulations in sec .",
    "[ simulation ] , and we confirm that the unbalanced bb84 protocol has larger key generation rate than the bb84 with the hardware fix .     preceded by the lossless phase modulator ( pm ) . ( b )",
    "is equivalent to ( c ) . ]",
    "in this section , we prove the unconditional security of the unbalanced bb84 protocol based on complementarity scenario @xcite .",
    "we consider only the single - photon part ( @xmath20 ) since we may not be able to or may have very little chance to generate the key from multi - photon part due to the so - called photon - number splitting ( pns ) attacks @xcite . in order to treat the photon number separately , we apply the argument by gllp @xcite or by koashi @xcite .",
    "for the simplicity of the discussion , we assume that the key is generated from the states of @xmath21 basis , and therefore the states of @xmath22 basis are only spent in the parameter estimation , i.e. , the so - called phase error estimation .      before the proof",
    ", we would like to discuss alice s source .",
    "thanks to the phase randomization , the density matrix of the pulses sent by alice becomes the mixture of the eigenstates of the photon number @xmath23 ( we rewrite the eigenstates as @xmath24 ) as follows @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the basis and bit value alice chooses for sending the pulses ( @xmath16 and @xmath28 in right - hand side corresponds to @xmath29 in the left - hand side ) , @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 , and the subscript @xmath32 represents the system to be sent to bob . the single - photon part ( @xmath20 ) of @xmath24",
    "is described as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where we define @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for the later convenience ,",
    "we define the relationships of the eigenstates of qubit states as follows : @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 .    in the following two paragraphs , we briefly review the essential point of the security proof of the _ balanced _ bb84 . in gllp",
    "argument @xcite or the argument by koashi in @xcite , we ask whether the privacy amplification succeeds if it is applied only to the qubits associated with the single - photon emission , and it is shown that we can generate the secret key with asymptotic key generation rate @xmath40 as follow @xcite .",

    "note that what the actual experiment gives alice and bob is the bit error rate in @xmath22 basis @xmath48 when bob chooses @xmath22 basis and alice sends a pulse in @xmath22 basis rather than a single - photon in @xmath21 basis . by using gllp argument or combining gllp argument with the decoy state idea @xcite",
    ", we can estimate the lower bound of @xmath49 , which is the contribution from alice s single - photon emission in @xmath50 , but this quantity is different from @xmath42 . in the _ balanced _",
    "bb84 , it turns out that these quantities match ( @xmath51 ) @xcite .",
    "the most important point to derive @xmath51 in the balanced bb84 is the basis independence of the state alice prepares and of bob s detection eq .",
    "thanks to this independence , eve can not behave differently between @xmath21 and @xmath22 basis so that we have @xmath51 @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we prove that @xmath51 is also the case for the unbalanced bb84 , which means that we can perform the data processing in the unbalanced bb84 as if there were no unbalance .      for the security proof ,",
    "we first consider a virtual protocol where we change the method to determine alice s bit value @xmath28 . in the virtual protocol",
    ", she firstly generates @xmath52 with the probability @xmath53 @xmath54 where the subscripts @xmath55 and @xmath32 respectively denote alice s and bob s system , which is mathematically expressed by hilbert space @xmath56 . after generating the state",
    ", she conducts @xmath16 basis measurement on her qubit , and she records the measurement outcome as her bit value @xmath28 in @xmath16 basis .",
    "finally , she sends the system @xmath32 to bob .",
    "we can confirm the state sent to bob is equivalent to the actual protocol . in the virtual protocol",
    ", it does not matter if alice delays her measurement after sending the state , and hence we assume this delay hereafter .    from the definition of @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    ", one can easily confirm that @xmath59 , i.e. , the state of the single - photon in the virtual protocol is basis - independent . by combining this independence with the basis - independence of bob s measurement , we have @xmath51 .",
    "this ends the proof .    as an alternative proof",
    "( also see fig .",
    "[ virtual ] ) , we furthermore modify the single - photon part of the virtual protocol that is equivalent to the single photon part of the unbalanced bb84 protocol .",
    "let @xmath60 be kraus operator corresponding to the successful event of her filtering operation . in the modified protocol",
    ", alice first prepares a basis - independent joint state @xmath61 , performs the filtering operation , and then she keeps only the successfully filtered state .",
    "we can confirm that the filtered state satisfies @xmath62 , which means that the post - selected state is also basis - independent .",
    "this ends the alternative proof .    in summary",
    ", we can prove the security of the unbalanced bb84 protocol by directly confirming the basis - independence @xmath59 together with the basis - independence of bob s measurement .",
    "alternatively , we consider the virtual protocol for the single - photon part , which is constructed by the preparation of the bell state @xmath61 followed by each side of basis - independent filtering operation with @xmath63 and @xmath18 , the post - selection , and each side of the two outcome measurements of @xmath16 basis .",
    "the two outcome measurements consist of @xmath19 in bob s side and projective @xmath16 basis qubit measurement @xmath64 in alice s side ( depicted in fig . [ virtual ] ) .",
    "this virtual protocol is composed only by basis - independent operations so that we have @xmath51 .",
    "basis which consists of @xmath64 ( @xmath19 ) following the post - selection by each side of the filters .",
    "note that the filtering operations @xmath65 and @xmath66 are basis - independent , and as a result we can safely apply the security proof of the standard bb84 to the filtered state . ]    from the above discussion , we conclude that the key generation rate of the unbalanced bb84 protocol is written as @xmath67\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this formula is completely equivalent to the rate of the balanced bb84 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can perform the data processing in the unbalanced bb84 as if there were no unbalance .",
    "the unbalance affects only the realization of the experimental data as we will see in the next section , and it never affects the key formula itself .",
    "we remark that we have used only the basis independence of the unbalance in our security proof .",
    "thus , it follows that as long as the unbalances are basis - independent , our conclusion holds even if the unbalance of the sending pulses and that of the measurement are unknown and fluctuate in time .",
    "it also follows that if we use the so - called squash operators @xcite for bob s measurement satisfying eq .",

    "in this section , we simulate the key generation rate by using the typical experimental parameters taken from the gobby - yuan - shields ( gys ) experiments @xcite . in the simulation ,",
    "we assume the use of infinite number of decoy states to obtain @xmath45 and @xmath49 .",
