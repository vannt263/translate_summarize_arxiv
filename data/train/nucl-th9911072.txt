    "experimental reduced electromagnetic transition strengths between the excited states of the nucleus @xmath0al have been collected by adams et al .",

    "thus the reduced transition probabilities @xmath28 of a given transition sequence can be labeled by the energies @xmath29 and @xmath30 of the initial and final states , respectively .",

    "the local average of the @xmath31 values of a given transition sequence is then @xmath37 the fact that the variance of the gaussian functions has been chosen equal to 4 is discussed in ref .",

    "they are zero in the present context .",
    "each of the larger blocks is broken down into four smaller blocks related to isospin symmetry .",

    "the dotted blocks contain small matrix elements  allowed by parity conservation but forbidden by isospin conservation .",
    "the white blocks contain zero matrix elements  forbidden by parity conservation .",
    "since in the present context parity is considered an exact symmetry , the experimenters do not try to measure parity violating transitions .",
    "they assume them to be zero and  this is the important point  they do not even list them on their records .",
    "hence , the experimental data set consists of the matrix elements in the two larger diagonal blocks .",
    "they are thus equivalent to the data that we have assumed in all foregoing considerations .",
    "hence , the existence of exactly conserved quantities in addition to the partially conserved isospin quantum number is irrelevant if they are not measured .",
    "the existence of partially conserved quantum numbers other than isospin would , however , alter the above results .",
    "in the present study , the effect of a partially broken symmetry has been investigated for the distributions of wave function components and transition probabilities .",
    "this has been done by means of a random matrix model similar to the one introduced by rosenzweig and porter  @xcite . however , in the present model not only the hamiltonian but also the transition operator may break the symmetry .",
    "this was dictated by the experimental material at hand and the symmetry that we had in mind .",
    "the data consist of a set of reduced electromagnetic transition probabilities in the nucleus @xmath0al .",
    "the symmetry is isospin conservation .",
    "eletromagnetic transition operators are in general not isospin conserving .",
    "a numerical simulation has shown that neither the components of the eigenfunctions nor the transition matrix elements follow gaussian distributions .",
    "this is counterintuitive since the central limit theorem seems to require gaussian distributions if the wave functions are  sufficiently complicated \" .",
    "instead , the numerical simulation suggests that the ensembles of both , the components of the eigenfunctions and the transition matrix elements , comprise at least one class of small elements and one class of large elements .",
    "the physical origin of these classes is clear : the small elements are isospin violating ; the large elements are isospin allowed .",
    "at best , each of the classes has a gaussian distribution .",
    "the probability density of the whole ensemble is then a superposition of gaussians with different parameters .",
    "this idea has been worked out in detail and results in a qualitative analytical evaluation of the random matrix model .",
    "it yields simple formulae for the parameters of the gaussians .",
    "its practical use is to circumvent easily the demanding numerical simulations .",
    "conceptually , it offers to see in detail , why the premises of the central limit theorem are not given : the elements in the different classes depend in different ways on the symmetry breaking parameter @xmath150 as well as the dimension @xmath72 of the space .",
    "it is well known that in the limit of @xmath308 an ever smaller value of @xmath150 suffices to make the above classes indistinguishable and thus to produce simple gaussian distributions of the eigenvector components and the transition matrix elements . however , this is what happens if @xmath72 is taken to infinity such that the parameter @xmath309 goes to infinity .",
    "if @xmath72 is finite or if it is taken to infinity together with @xmath310 such that @xmath161 remains finite , then the above mentioned classes conserve their identity .",
    "it is this situation which the present paper deals with .",
    "the present results thus support a conjecture formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of the data collected from @xmath0al : the authors conjectured that the distribution of the electromagnetic transition probabilities carries the signature of partial isospin breaking .",
    "the present theory offers a qualitative understanding of the data .",
    "whether it can quantitatively reproduce the data remains to be seen .",
    "we have not attempted to fit the theory to the data .",
    "a caveat seems necessary : the random matrix model  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) applies to any partially broken quantum number  it is not specific for isospin . certainly , the available information on isospin breaking in @xmath0al requires that the distribution of the transition probabilities differs from a porter - thomas distribution to the extent given by the dotted curve on fig .",
    "[ fig8 ]  but the data may in principle and in addition carry the signature of other partially conserved quantum numbers",
    ". these may not be as fundamental as isospin but rather given by the specific form of the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction in the sd shell .",
    "very recently , an analytical calculation , based on the supersymmetry method , of the wave function statistics in coupled chaotic systems was presented in ref .",
