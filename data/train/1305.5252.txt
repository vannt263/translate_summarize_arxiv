    "in the last years a deeper understanding of scattering amplitudes in qfts with a high degree of symmetry was pursued .",
    "the most studied and understood example is the planar limit of @xmath0 sym in four dimensions , where , thanks to the large symmetry group , many efficient methods have been developed @xcite . in particular an hidden symmetry of this theory has been recently discovered : the dual superconformal invariance @xcite , that together with the usual superconformal symmetry , gives origin to the infinite dimensional yangian symmetry of the theory .",
    "the presence of such infinite dimensional symmetry hidden in the lagrangian formulation of the theory , and the unexpected simplicity of some scattering amplitudes , foster the research for a `` dual '' formulation for its @xmath1-matrix , where the full symmetry group is manifest and the scattering processes and their singularities have a simple form . in @xcite a dual formulation",
    "was proposed in terms of the geometry of an auxiliary algebraic geometric variety called the totally non negative grassmannian . in this formulation the information needed to reconstruct the scattering amplitudes are encoded in the combinations of residues of contour integrals of some well defined invariant form on the grassmannian @xcite .",
    "the space - time locality and unitarity of the theory are emergent , non explicitly imposed , properties , while the full symmetry of the theory is manifest and encoded in the algebraic structure of the grassmannian and its decomposition in subspaces .    quite interestingly",
    "the totally non negative grassmannians are intimately related to a set of bipartite graphs ( collections of edges connecting black and white nodes ) drawn on disks @xcite .",
    "these graphs are the so called on - shell diagrams describing the scattering process : all the particles in the diagrams are on - shell . very similar bipartite graphs , but living on tori instead of disks , have played a central role in the understanding of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "they describe the field theory living on a stack of d3 brane probing some calabi - yau singularity with at least @xmath2 symmetries : the so called toric calabi - yau singularities .",
    "recently there was some interest in the study of the bipartite graphs on riemann surfaces other that the torus and the field theory associated to them @xcite .",
    "the field theories defined by bipartite graph on disks , relevant for scattering processes , are special examples of this new class of theories . in particular it was shown that , as in the case of the torus , it is always possible to associate a toric variety to these field theories @xcite .",
    "it is natural to wonder if these two parallel lines of research based on bipartite graphs on disks could produce interesting contributions one to the other .",
    "indeed for example in @xcite it was observed that the mathematical structure of the two lines of research is exactly the same , supporting the idea that it is worthwhile to investigate this relationship in more detail .",
    "an important step was done in @xcite where it was shown how to associate a toric variety to a given bipartite graph on the disk , that can be smoothly mapped to a specific subspace of the non negative grassmannian , relevant for the scattering amplitudes .",
    "this important result opens the possibility of an explicit reformulation of the scattering process in terms of toric varieties .",
    "this is the line of thought that we will pursue in this paper .",
    "indeed , motivated by this connection , in this paper we study the relation among bipartite graphs , the grassmannian and its subspaces , and the toric geometry .",
    "taking advantage of some well developed techniques available for the case of the bipartite diagrams on the tori we find a very simple global description of the toric geometry associated to the bipartite graphs on the disk and its map to the non negative grassmannian .",
    "we study the local and global coordinates and the associated map between toric and grassmannian geometry , the decomposition of the grassmannian in subspaces and the associated decomposition of toric varieties in their toric subspaces , and the cluster transformations of the coordinates among different patches .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : reviewnima ] we give a general overview of the connection between the scattering amplitudes and the bipartite graphs on the disk , grassmannian geometry and toric geometry . to clarify some aspects of these connections we study two simple examples . in section [ bipsec ]",
    "we start a deeper analysis of the bipartite diagrams on the disks .",
    "we define the main objects necessary to our investigations , the perfect matchings and the perfect orientations and we discuss the two polytopes , the matching and the matroid polytope , that play a key role in the relation with the amplitudes . in section [ mainres ]",
    "we derive one of the main results of our paper .",
    "we show that there is a simple system of coordinates describing the points in the grassmannian obtained from the bipartite diagrams . in section [ toriccell ]",
    "we review the relation between the bipartite graphs and toric geometry and explain the difference between the toric varieties associated to the scattering amplitudes and the ones studied in the ads / cft literature . in section [ ese ] we revisit the examples under this new light , and study the amplitudes in terms of their relation with the toric varieties . in section [ cluster ] we analyze the transformation of our coordinates under a set of movement on the diagrams , usually referred as square moves ( seiberg duality in the physics literature ) , and we describe in this picture the associated cluster transformations . in section [ conc ]",
    "we conclude and discuss some further directions of research in this field . in appendix",
    "[ appe ] and [ coplanar ] we review some mathematical material related to the grassmannian and some further property of the toric geometric varieties associated to the on - shell diagrams .",
    "the standard formulation of quantum field theory is based on the concepts of manifest locality and unitarity .",
    "however this description forces to introduce redundancies associated to the gauge symmetries and it hides some of the important structures of the field theory itself .",
    "this observation is supported by the simple final results of various complicated scattering amplitudes processes , the hidden dual conformal symmetry and the infinite dimensional yangian symmetry of planar @xmath0 sym , and , more generally , by the existence of various gauge / string dualities and gauge / gauge dualities hidden in the standard formulation of quantum field theory @xcite . inspired by these motivations there was a recent effort in trying to reformulate the description of some of the physical processes of a quantum field theory , namely scattering amplitudes , in a setup where the concepts of locality , unitarity , lagrangian , etc @xmath3 , do not play any fundamental role , but they are instead emergent structures of a description where all the symmetries of the theory are manifest and where all the quantities that are computed are on - shell and well defined .",
    "the idea to reconstruct the scattering amplitudes of a field theory starting from an on - shell formulation where the symmetries are manifest and the basic objects are well defined and free of divergences is somehow a natural paradigm for a theoretical physicist , but that has been a bit obscured by all the well know difficulties of standard quantum field theory .    along this general line of reasoning , a systematic way to reconstruct the",
    "all loops scattering amplitudes of planar @xmath0 sym was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the main insight is to focus on a certain class of objects : the so called on - shell diagrams .",
    "these diagrams are obtained by gluing together elementary three particle processes , and are well defined functions of the external momenta of a scattering process .",
    "pictorially they are very similar to the usual feynman diagrams , but physically they are very different : all the momenta are on - shell and complex in general .",
    "the underlying intuitive understanding of this reformulation is a different way to think about permutations .",
    "indeed it was observed that the four dimensional scattering amplitudes behave somehow similarly to the @xmath4 integrable two dimensional systems , where the scattering matrix can be reformulated in terms of permutations only . in the four dimensional case",
    "the relation between scattering amplitudes and permutations is slightly different from the case of two dimensional systems , but the bottom line is that a permutation , or a set of permutations , can be associated to a scattering process .",
    "the integrand of the scattering amplitudes can be computed from the permutations and hence the full amplitude can be reconstructed .",
    "the first step is to observe that also in four dimensions permutations can be represented graphically by classes of on - shell two dimensional diagrams .",
    "these on - shell diagrams are unoriented bicolored graphs drawn on a disk with black and white vertices connected by edges ( see for example ( [ beeq ] ) ) , and they are supposed to contain the physical information of the scattering of @xmath5 massless particles : @xmath6 with negative helicity and @xmath7 with positive one sym is a super - amplitude , where the highest order component is the amplitude for @xmath6 gluons with negative helicity and @xmath7 gluons with positve helicity . in all the paper we will keep on focusing on the highest component of the super - amplitudes , with the hope that the reader will not be confused by this abuse of notation . ] .",
    "the diagram has indeed @xmath5 external edges that end on the boundary and intuitively represent the @xmath5 massless particles in the scattering process .",
    "the edges represent the on - shell particles involved in the process and the coloring of the vertices are related to the helicities . at computational level",
    "one should integrate over all the internal edges ( complex internal momenta ) and impose momentum conservation at every vertex .    in @xcite a systematic way to deal with these on - shell diagrams",
    "was explained .",
    "it unifies the description of any scattering processes and it is manifestly invariant under the full symmetry of the theory .",
    "this strategy reformulates the scattering process in terms of permutations and auxiliary algebraic geometric varieties , and provides a nice new point of view to look at the quantum field theory dynamics .",
    "the on - shell diagrams are associated to the permutations as follows .",
    "let us first introduce a notion of path in the diagram : a path is a collection of consecutive edges in the graph ; if a path turns maximally right at the black nodes and maximally left at the white ones it is called _ left - right _ path .",
    "given an on - shell graph , the permutation is obtained by connecting the external vertices of the diagram with the left - right paths .",
    "these paths uniquely provide a map among the @xmath5 external particles .",
    "this map is a permutation of @xmath5 objects .",
    "the permutation provides also the number @xmath6 of external particles with negative helicities : this is the number of particles that are sent `` beyond '' @xmath5 by the permutation .",
