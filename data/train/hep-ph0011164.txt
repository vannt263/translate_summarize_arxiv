    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) is a practical and widely accepted effective field theory to deal with low energy processes in hadronic physics . @xcite .",
    "the essential point stressed in this approach is that the low energy physics does not depend on the details of the short distance dynamics , but rather on some bulk properties effectively encoded in the low energy parameters .",
    "this point of view has been implicitly adopted in practice in everyday quantum physics ; well separated energy and distance scales can be studied independently of each other .",
    "the effective field theory approach also makes such a natural idea into a workable and systematic computational scheme .",
    "the great advantage of chpt is that the expansion parameter can be clearly identified _ a priori _ ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) when carrying out systematic calculations of mass splittings , form factors and scattering amplitudes .",
    "however , the connection to the underlying qcd dynamics becomes obscure since the problem is naturally formulated in terms of the relevant hadronic low energy degrees of freedom with no explicit reference to the fundamental quarks and gluons .",
    "in addition , in some cases ( see below ) a possible drawback is the lack of numerical convergence of such an expansion when confronted to experimental data , a problem that gets worse as the energy of the process increases .",
    "recent analysis provide good examples of both rapid convergence and slow convergence in chpt .",
    "in the @xmath0 sector the situation to two loops  @xcite seems to be very good for the scattering lengths . here , the expansion parameter is @xmath5 ( @xmath6 the physical mass of the charged pion ) and the coefficients of the expansion are of order unity .",
    "for instance , to two loops ( third order in the expansion parameter ) the expansion of the s - wave of the isospin @xmath7 channel reads  @xcite @xmath8 where the theoretical errors are described in  @xcite .",
    "thus the expansion up to two loops is both convergent @xmath9 and predictive @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the _ prediction _ of chpt of s - wave scattering lengths @xmath12 in the isospin @xmath7 and @xmath13 channels yields  @xcite @xmath14 the theoretical predictions for these observables are an order of magnitude more accurate than the corresponding experimental numbers .",
    "note that in hadronic physics we are usually dealing with the opposite situation , confronting accurate measurements to inaccurate theoretical model calculations . on the contrary , for @xmath1 scattering , for chpt in the heavy baryon formulation",
    "the expansion is less rapidly converging than in the @xmath0 case , since nlo corrections become comparable to the lo ones .",
    "for instance in the @xmath15-channel the expansion up to third order , after a fit to the threshold properties , reads  @xcite @xmath16 here first order means @xmath17 , second order @xmath18 and third order @xmath19 and @xmath20 . despite these caveats ,",
    "there is no doubt that the effective field theory approach provides a general framework where one can either verify or falsify , not only bulk properties of the underlying dynamics , but also the dynamics of all models sharing the same general symmetries of qcd .",
    "finally , let us remark that the perturbative nature of the chiral expansion makes the generation of pole singularities , either bound states or resonances , impossible from the very begining unless they are already present at lowest order in the expansion .",
    "there are no bound states in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems , but the @xmath21 and the @xmath22 resonances are outstanding features of these reactions dominating the corresponding cross sections at the c.m . energies @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "exact unitarity plays a crucial role in the description of resonances .",
    "however , chpt only satisfies unitarity perturbatively .",
    "nevertheless , there are many ways to restore exact unitarity out of perturbative information , i.e. : the @xmath25-matrix method ref .",
    "@xcite , the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) ref .",
    "@xcite , the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) ref .",
    "@xcite , the n / d method ref .",
    "@xcite , etc .",
    "( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , which are closely related to one another .",
    "some of these unitarization methods have been very successful describing experimental data in the intermediate energy region including the resonant behavior . despite this success",
    "the main drawback is that this approach is not as systematic as standard chpt , for instance in the estimation of the order of the neglected corrections . in this work we report on our most recent works related to unitarization , both in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 sectors , where we have obtained intermediate energy _",
    "predictions _ using the chiral parameters and their error bars obtained from standard chpt applied at low energies .",
    "this means in practice transporting the possible correlations among the fitting parameters obtained from a fit where the phase shifts are assumed to be gauss - distributed in an uncorrelated way .",
    "the chpt expansion displays a very good convergence in the meson - meson sector . as a consequence",
    "the unitarization methods have been very successful in extending the chpt applicability to higher energies . in particular , within a coupled channel iam formalism , it has been possible to describe all the meson - meson scattering data , even the resonant behavior , below 1.2 gev @xcite , but without including explicitly any resonance field .",
    "these works have already been extensively described in the literature and here we will concentrate in the most recent works of two of the authors on the @xmath0 sector , dealing with the bethe - salpeter equation , which has the nice advantage of allowing us to identify the diagrams which are resumed .    indeed , any unitarization method performs , in some way or another , an infinite sum of perturbative contributions . at first sight",
    ", this may seem arbitrary , but some constraints have to be imposed on the unitarization method to comply with the spirit of the perturbative expansion we want to enforce . in the bse approach",
    "the natural objects to be expanded are the _ potential _ and the _ propagators_. the bse as it has been used in refs .",
    "@xcite reads ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kin ] ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the total scattering amplitude is determined by its relation with the differential cross section in the cm system of the two identical mesons and it is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",

    "notice that in our normalization the unitarity limit implies @xmath45 .",
    "the solution of the bse at lowest order , i.e. , taking the free propagators for the mesons and the potential as the tree level amplitude can be obtained after algebraic manipulations described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , renormalization and matching to the taylor expansion up to second order in @xmath46 of the one loop chiral perturbation theory result .",
    "we only quote here the result for the @xmath21 channel : @xmath47 \\\\ & + & { 1\\over s-4m^2 } \\left\\ { { m^2 \\over 4 \\pi^2 } \\left [ 2 ( \\bar l_2 - \\bar l_1 ) + 3 \\bar l_4 - { 65 \\over 24 } \\right ] - 6 f^2 \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the unitarity integral @xmath48 reads @xmath49 here the complex phase of the argument of the @xmath50 is taken in the interval @xmath51 .",
    "similar expressions hold for the scalar - isoscalar ( @xmath52 ) and the scalar - isotensor channels .",
    "notice that in this , so - called _ off - shell _ scheme , the left hand cut is replaced at lowest order by a pole in the region @xmath53 .",
    "for the low energy coefficients @xmath54 we take the values @xmath55 in both sets @xmath56 and @xmath57 have been determined from the @xmath58 mass formulae and the scalar radius as suggested in  @xcite and in  @xcite , respectively . on the other hand",
    "the values of @xmath59 come from the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite of the data on @xmath60decays ( set * a * ) and from the combined study of @xmath60decays and @xmath0 with some unitarization procedure ( set * b * ) performed in ref .",
    "the results for the @xmath21 channel are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : off - res ] .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite it is also possible to take into account the left hand cut in the so - called _ on - shell _ scheme where it can be shown that after renormalization the on - shell unitarized amplitude acquires the following form @xmath61 where @xmath62 should be a constant , independent of @xmath63 and the subtraction point @xmath64 , and chosen to have a well defined limit when @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 is the _ on - shell_-potential and has the important property of being real for @xmath68 , and presenting cuts in the four pion threshold and the left hand cut caused by the unitarity cuts in the @xmath69 and @xmath70 channels .",
    "the potential can be determined by matching the amplitude to the chpt amplitude in a perturbative expansion .",
    "this method provides a way of generating a unitarized amplitude directly in terms of the low energy coefficients @xmath54 and their errors . in this _ on - shell",
    "_ scheme a successful description of both @xmath0 scattering data as well as the electromagnetic pion form factor , in agreement with watson s theorem , becomes possible yielding a very accurate determination of some low energy parameters .",
    "the procedure to do this becomes a bit involved and we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for further details .",
    "we should also say that the one - loop unitarized amplitudes generate the complete chpt result and _ some _ of the two and higher loop results .",
    "the comparison of the generated two - loop contribution of threshold parameters with those obtained from the full two loop calculation is quantitatively satisfactory within uncertainties .",
    "the methods and results found in the @xmath0 system are very encouraging , suggesting the extension to the @xmath1 system .",
    "however , chpt does not work in the @xmath71 sector as nicely as it does in the @xmath0 sector .",
    "as we will see , the low convergence rate of the chiral expansion makes it difficult to match standard amplitudes to unitarized ones in a numerically sensible manner . after an initial attempt within the relativistic formulation  @xcite",
    ", it was proposed to treat the baryon as a heavy particle well below the nucleon production threshold  @xcite . the resulting heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt )",
    "provides a consistent framework for the one nucleon sector , particularly in @xmath71 scattering  @xcite .",
    "the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite adopting the original relativistic formalism but with a clever renormalization scheme seems rather promising but unfortunately the phenomenological applications to @xmath71 scattering have not been worked out yet .",
    "the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) is a unitarization method where the inverse amplitude , and not the amplitude , is expanded , i.e. , if we have the perturbative expansion for the partial wave amplitude @xmath73 , @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 the c.m .",
    "momentum , then one considers the expansion @xmath77 ^ 2 } + { f_2 ( \\omega)^2 \\over [ f_1 ( \\omega)]^3 } + \\dots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the iam fulfills exact unitarity , @xmath78 and reproduces the perturbative expansion to the desired order .    this method has been applied for @xmath1 scattering  @xcite to unitarize the hbchpt results of ref .",
    "@xcite to third order . in this context",
    ", it is worth pointing out that the use of a similar unitarization method , together with very simple phenomenological models , was already successfully undertaken in the 70 s ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nonetheless , a systematic application within an effective lagrangian approach was not carried out . in  @xcite the phase shifts for the partial waves up to the inelastic thresholds",
    "have been fitted , obtaining the right pole for the @xmath79 in the @xmath15 channel . in that work ,",
    "it has been pointed out that to get the best accuracy with data , one needs chiral parameters of unnatural size , very different from those of perturbative hbchpt .",
    "this is most likely related to the slow convergence rate of the expansion .",
    "however , it must be stressed that one can still reproduce the @xmath79 with second order parameters compatible with the hypothesis of resonance saturation  @xcite . in a subsequent work  @xcite",
    "we have proposed an improved iam method based on a reordering of the hbchpt series .",
    "the encouraging results for the @xmath22-channel have also been extended to the remaining low partial waves  @xcite , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : iam ] . in this case , the size of the chiral parameters is natural and the @xmath80 per d.o.f is considerably better than the iam applied to plain hbchpt .",
    "= 215pt      recently  @xcite , we have used the bse to hbchpt at lowest order in the chiral expansion and have looked at the @xmath15 channel .",
    "we have found a dispersive solution which needs four subtraction constants , @xmath81 where the unitarity integral is given by @xmath82 the @xmath83 fit yields the following numerical values for the parameters : @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "however , if we match the coefficients with those stemming from hbchpt we would get instead the following numerical values : @xmath86 the discrepancy is , again , attributed to the low convergence rate of the expansion .",
    "the results for the @xmath15 phase shift both for the fit and the montecarlo propagated errors of the hbchpt matched amplitudes have been depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ]    = 600pt      one of the greatest advantages of both the iam and the bse methods is that the generalization to include coupled channels is rather straightforward . for the iam case",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details . as for the bse ,",
    "two of the authors  @xcite have dealt with the problem in the @xmath88 channel , at @xmath89 up to @xmath90 using the full relativistic , rather than the heavy baryon formulation used in ref .",
    "@xcite for the s - wave and extended in ref .  @xcite to account for p - wave effects . for these energies",
    "there are four open channels , namely @xmath71,@xmath91,@xmath92 and @xmath93 , so that the bse becomes a @xmath94 matrix equation for the @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 partial wave .",
    "additional complications arise due to the dirac spinor structure of the nucleon , but the bse can be analytically solved after using the above mentioned off - shell renormalization scheme .",
    "it turns out  @xcite that to lowest order in the potential and the propagators , one needs 12 unknown parameters , which should be used to fit experimental data .",
    "several features make the fitting procedure a bit cumbersome . in the first place",
    ", there is no conventional analysis in the relativistic version of chpt for this process and thus no clear constraints can be imposed on the unknown parameters . secondly , the channel @xmath98 is not included in our calculation",
    ". therefore one should not expect perfect agreement with experiment , particularly in the elastic channel since it is known that @xmath99 of the @xmath100 resonance decay width goes into @xmath101 . on the other hand",
    ", one can not deduce from here how important is the @xmath102 channel in the @xmath103 production channel , @xmath104 . actually , in ref .  @xcite it has been suggested that the bulk of the process may be explained without appealing to the three body intermediate state @xmath105 . the work of ref .",
    "@xcite would correspond in our nomenclature to the on - shell lowest order bse approximation , which by our own experience describes well the bulk of the data . with the bse we have provided a further improvement at low energies by including higher order corrections . in the absence of a canonical low energy analysis",
    "it seems wiser to proceed using the off - shell renormalization scheme . in fig .",
    "[ fig : acoplado ] we present a possible 12 parameter fit which accounts both for the elastic low and intermediate energy region and the lowest production channels . the failure to describe data around the @xmath106 resonance",
    "is expected , since as we have already mentioned the @xmath101 channel must be included .",
    "our results seem to confirm the assumption made in ref .",
    "@xcite regarding the unimportance of the three body channel in describing the coupling of the @xmath106 resonance to @xmath107 .",
    "the results presented here show the success and provide further support for unitarization methods complemented with standard chiral perturbation theory , particularly in the case when resonances are present .",
    "but unitarization by itself is not a guarantee of success ; the unitarization method has to be carefully chosen so that it provides a systematic convergent and predictive expansion , as we have discussed above . in order to describe the data in the intermediate energy region the chiral parameters",
    "can then be obtained from    * either a direct @xmath80 fit of the order by order unitarized amplitude and the corresponding low energy parameters .",
    "the upper energy limit is determined by imposing an acceptable description @xmath108 . * or from a low energy determination of the low energy parameters with errors by performing a @xmath80-fit of the standard chpt amplitude until @xmath109 , and subsequent montecarlo error propagation of the unitarized amplitude .",
    "differences in the low energy parameters within several methods should be compatible within errors , as long as the chiral expansion has a good convergence .",
    "but , unfortunately this is not always the case . clearly , the @xmath1 sector is not only more cumbersome theoretically than the @xmath0 sector but also more troublesome from a numerical point of view .",
    "standard chpt to a given order can be seen as a particular choice which sets higher order terms to zero in order to comply with exact crossing but breaking exact unitarity .",
    "the unitarization of a the chpt amplitude is also another choice of higher order terms designed to reproduce exact unitarity but breaking exact crossing symmetry .",
    "given our inability to write a closed analytic expresion for an amplitude in a chiral expansion which simultaneously fulfills both exact crossing and unitarity we have preferred exact unitarity .",
    "this is justified a posteriori by the successful description of data in the intermediate energy region , which indeed suggests a larger convergence radius of the chiral expansion .",
