    "domains formed during the evolution of mixtures are of both theoretical and technological importance , applications including foams  @xcite , cellular tissues  @xcite , superconductors  @xcite , magnetic domains  @xcite , adsorbed atoms on surfaces , _ etc . _ in particular , in metallurgy and surface science ,",
    "the polycrystalline microstructure , and its time evolution , are important in determining the material properties .    after a sudden change in temperature ( or in another suitable control parameter ) that takes the system from the high temperature phase into the coexistence region",
    ", the system tends to organize in progressively larger ordered structures .",
    "the system s temporal evolution is ruled by thermal , diffusive , and curvature driven processes , and the actual growth law depends on general features suchlike the presence of quenched disorder , the dimension of the order parameter and whether it is conserved or not . although much is known for binary mixtures and systems with twofold ground degeneracy ( @xmath1 ) , much less is understood for polymixtures and manifolded ground states ( @xmath2 ) . in the latter case , topological defects pin the domain wall dynamics and even in pure systems thermal activation is necessary to overcome the corresponding energy barriers .",
    "many interesting cellular growth processes are captured by a curvature - driven ordering processes in which thermal effects play a minor role .",
    "these are ruled by the allen - cahn equation in which the local velocity of an interface is proportional to the local curvature , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a temperature and @xmath0-dependent dimensional constant related with the surface tension and mobility of a domain wall and @xmath5 is the local curvature .",
    "the sign is such that the domain wall curvature is diminished along the evolution . in @xmath6 the time dependence of the area contained within any finite domain interface ( the hull ) on a flat surface is obtained by integrating the velocity around the hull and using the gauss - bonnet theorem : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the turning angles of the tangent vector to the surface at the @xmath9 possible vertices or triple junctions . in some systems , such as the ising @xmath1 model , @xmath10 since there are no such vertices and we obtain @xmath11 for all hull - enclosed areas , irrespective of their size  @xcite . in highly anisotropic systems , as the potts model studied here ,",
    "the angles are all different . in some of the systems that motivate this work , like soap froths , the angles are all equal to @xmath12 , that is , @xmath13 . focusing on systems",
    "in which there is a one - to - one correspondence between vertices and sides ( meaning that we exclude the ising limit in which there are no vertices but each wall has one side ) the above equation reduces to the von neumann law  @xcite for the area @xmath14 of an @xmath9-sided hull - enclosed area : @xmath15 whether a cell grows , shrinks or remains with constant area depends on its number of sides being , respectively , larger than , smaller than or equal to 6 .",
    "the above law can be extended to the case in which the typical internal angle depends on the number of sides  @xcite and to @xmath16  @xcite as well .",
    "potts models , that is to say @xmath0-state spin models on a lattice , simulate grain growth . early studies of the @xmath17 @xmath0-state potts model with non - conserved order - parameter dynamics have shown that the growth law is analogous to that of the ( non conserved ) ising model , where in the scaling regime the characteristic length scale follows the @xmath18 allen - cahn law  @xcite , regardless of the value of @xmath0 . however , for @xmath2 and @xmath19 , this power law growth does not hold for long times , the characteristic length scale converging to a limiting value .",
    "this is in agreement with the lifshitz - safran criterium  @xcite that states that when the ground state degeneracy is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the system dimensionality , there might be domain wall pinning depending on the lattice geometry and the density of topological defects . in the @xmath17 potts model  @xcite with @xmath22",
    "such point defects are the convergence of three distinct phases borders  @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic density of defects that depends on @xmath0 ( negligible for @xmath23 but nonzero for @xmath24 ) was also related with glassy behavior  @xcite . in the presence of thermal fluctuations ,",
    "the excess energy due to too many domain borders disappears after a transient  @xcite .    in a sequence of papers",
    "@xcite , we explored the time evolution of domain and hull - enclosed area distributions in bidimensional coarsening systems with scalar order parameter . to study the non - conserved order parameter case , on the one hand we used a continuum description based on the ginzburg - landau equation for the scalar field and the allen - cahn law @xmath11 . on the other hand",

    "more concretely , the number of hull - enclosed areas per unit system area , in the interval @xmath25 at time @xmath26 is related to the distribution at the initial time @xmath27 through @xmath28 \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq.map}\\ ] ] once the initial distribution is known , the above equation gives the distribution at any time @xmath26 .",
    "for example , if one takes as initial states at @xmath29 configurations in equilibrium state at @xmath30 , where the distribution is exactly known for @xmath1  @xcite , @xmath31 with @xmath32 , the distribution at @xmath33 is @xmath34 , that compares extremely well with simulation data for the ising model on a square lattice  @xcite . for a quench from infinite temperature , on the other hand , the initial distribution corresponds to the one of the critical random continuous percolation  @xcite .",
    "this observation is an essential ingredient to understand the fact that , and obtain the probability with which , the system attains a striped frozen state at zero temperature ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "interestingly , on a square lattice , the initial state does not correspond to the random percolation critical point but the coarsening evolution gets very close to it after one or two monte carlo steps .",
    "therefore , although eq .",
    "( [ eq.map ] ) was obtained with the continuous description and , a priori , it is not guaranteed to apply on a lattice , it does describe the coarsening dynamics of the discrete ising model remarkably accurately . in the presence of vertices , instead ,",
    "the single hull - enclosed area evolution depends on @xmath9 and , notably , a given hull - enclosed area can either shrink or grow depending on whether @xmath35 or @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "therefore , one can not write a simple relation as the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq.map ] ) to link the area distribution at time @xmath26 to the one at the initial time @xmath27 and the distribution might get scrambled in a non - trivial way during the coarsening process ( for example , when a domain disappears , the number of sides of the neighboring domains changes , along with their growth rate ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the distribution of hull - enclosed areas during evolution in a potts model with different number of states , notably @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we then try to give an answer to some questions that can be posed when dealing with more than two competing ground states . to what extent",
    "the results obtained for @xmath1 are also valid for @xmath22 ?",
    "in particular , in a quench from infinite temperature , does the random percolation critical point affect the evolution as it does for @xmath1 ? moreover , which is the interplay between nucleation and growth when the system goes through a first - order phase transition as in the cases @xmath24 ?",
    "what happens when the starting point of the quench is a first order transition point , with finite range correlations ? in the presence of weak disorder , when first order transitions become continuous , are the scaling functions universal ( super - universality ) ?",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section.potts ]",
    "we introduce the potts model and , in section [ section.eq-time.corr ] , we study the space - time correlation function starting from differently correlated initial states . then , in section [ section.na ] , several area distribution functions , either in the initial state or after the quench in temperature , are studied and described in detail .",
    "afterwards , in section [ section.disorder ] , the potts model with ferromagnetic random bonds ( weak disorder ) is studied and compared with the pure model .",
    "finally , we make some final remarks and conclude .",
    "we consider the potts model  @xcite on a square lattice of @xmath37 spins with @xmath38 , the state variables of which , @xmath39 with @xmath40 , assume integer values from 1 to @xmath0 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath41 where the sum is over nearest - neighbor spins on the lattice and , until section [ section.disorder ] , @xmath42 .",
    "the transition , discontinuous for @xmath24 and continuous for @xmath23 , occurs at @xmath43 .",
    "we run from 500 to 4000 swendsen - wang ( sw ) algorithm steps to reach an equilibrium initial condition at the critical point , and average over 1000 samples to build the correlations and distributions .",
    "after equilibrium is attained and the system quenched , the evolution follows the heat - bath monte carlo algorithm  @xcite and all times are given in monte carlo step ( mcs ) units , each one corresponding to a sweep over @xmath44 randomly chosen spins .     to @xmath45 mcs ) after a quench from @xmath46 to @xmath47 for @xmath1 , 3 and 8 , with and without weak disorder ( the disordered case is discussed in section [ section.disorder ] ) .",

    "the characteristic length , related to the average domain radius , depends weakly on @xmath0 and @xmath51 for the pure model ( through the prefactor ) . within the time window explored",
    "there are still some small deviations from the expected allen - cahn behavior , @xmath52 in the case @xmath53 .",

    "@xmath23 the paramagnetic state becomes unstable at @xmath30 and after a quench to any non - zero sub - critical temperature the system orders locally and progressively in patches of each of the equilibrium phases ; in other words , it undergoes domain growth . in the cases",
    "@xmath24 one can distinguish three working temperature regimes : at very low @xmath55 the system gets easily pinned ; at higher @xmath55 but below the spinodal temperature @xmath56 at which the paramagnetic solution becomes unstable the system undergoes domain growth ; above the spinodal @xmath56 there is competition between nucleation and growth and coarsening .",
    "however , the latter regime is very hard to access since @xmath56 is very close to @xmath30 ( e.g. @xmath57 for @xmath58  @xcite ) . in this work we focus on the dynamics in the intermediate coarsening regime .",
    "the detailed evolution of the system during the coarsening dynamics depends on the correlations already present in the initial state , whether absent ( @xmath46 ) , short- ( @xmath59 for all @xmath0 and also @xmath60 for @xmath24 ) or long - range ( @xmath60 for @xmath23 ) . in the latter case",
