    "in the last decade , several efforts have led to a better understanding of the building history of the disc of the andromeda galaxy ( hereafter m31 , table  [ opt_par ] ) , the most nearby massive spiral galaxy to the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "one of the most exciting result is probably the discovery of an extended stellar halo around m31 @xcite . more and more studies are completing this new view of the stellar distribution of m31 and",
    "are revealing little by little the complex chemical , kinematical and morphological nature of its halo @xcite .",
    "basically , these authors find that the outskirts of the stellar disc are very clumpy and irregular , and the extended halo is a mix of many metal poor and rich substructures like the south - eastern giant stream ( gs ) and other seemingly shorter streamlike extensions , low luminosity dwarf satellites and globular clusters , as well as an old metal poor underlying ( primordial ? ) halo which extends up to at least 150 kpc ( in projection ) .",
    "these stellar tidal features and companion galaxies are the probable main imprints of the hierarchical growth of the m31 stellar disc and halo , like the ones encountered in numerical models of dark matter evolution in the framework of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerical models trying to explain the presence of the gs tidal debris around m31 propose a tidal interaction with a @xmath5 @xmath3   galaxy progenitor @xcite .",
    "the gas content in the halo of m31 has also been probed recently from deep  measurements , allowing the detection of a population of discrete low luminosity clouds , with masses in the range of @xmath6 to @xmath7 @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the authors suggest that those clouds could be the analogs of the high - velocity  clouds seen around the mw @xcite .",
    "they also suggest a manyfold origin of that gas ( residual from galaxy merger or interaction , cooling flow in the local group , etc ... ) , which may only contribute to @xmath8% of the total   disc mass of m31 .",
    "gas clouds from the intergalactic medium could thus also be the building blocks of m31 .    at the same time , the advent of the new generation of x - ray , ultraviolet and infrared space observatories allows to probe the structure of the interstellar medium of m31 with unprecedented details @xcite .",
    "for instance , the mid - infrared images reveal a dominant ring - like distribution for the dust component .",
    "its perturbed morphology seems to have been shaped by the passage of the companion messier 32 through the m31 disc @xcite .",
    "a high resolution kinematical survey of the molecular gas contained in the ring and spiral structures has also been presented @xcite .",
    "a large part of the  studies that have been done on m31 go back up to @xmath930 years ago @xcite .",
    "these data were acquired at low spectral and/or angular resolution data and did not necessarily cover the whole disc of the galaxy , mainly for sensitivity reasons .",
    "another more recent  study of m31 has been presented in @xcite from vla observations .",
    "perhaps the most important result from all these studies is that the  disc of m31 exhibits a warp whose effects are remarkable in the datacube by the presence of many spectral  peaks along different line - of - sights .",
    "another interesting result by @xcite is the modeling of a rotation curve that appears to decline as a function of the galactic distance .",
    "a study of the mass distribution using this rotation curve only requires stellar bulge plus disc components , with no need of any dark matter halo .",
    "if it is really the case , m31 would be very different from every other spiral galaxies which are known to exhibit a flat rotation curve ( or even increasing ) at large galactocentric distances and thus to contain a massive hidden mass , unless the law of gravity is modified in these acceleration regimes @xcite .",
    "this result was the main motivation to get single dish observations along the photometric major axis for the approaching disc half .",
    "indeed , radial velocities of the   gas in the receding side of m31 are contaminated by  gas in the mw .",
    "we concluded that the outer  rotation curve can not be decreasing but seems remarkably flat at the largest radii @xcite .",
    "however , since it was not possible to model the warp properly with those single dish data , it was decided in 2005 to get full 2d velocity information from wide - field synthesis observations at drao .    in this article",
    ", we present preliminary morphological , kinematical and dynamical results obtained from the analysis of the drao  observations .",
    "the direct objectives of this article are to present the most extended  distribution of m31 , to derive an accurate  rotation curve in order to verify whether the rotation velocities really decrease at large galactocentric distances or really remain constant , as well as to derive its basic dynamical parameters .",
    "it is worth mentioning here the very recent , wide - field and high angular  imaging presented in @xcite with the help of the wsrt and gbt telescopes .",
    "future results from that very deep dataset will surely serve as independent comparison with those we present in this article and in other forthcoming papers from this series .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ observations ] describes the drao observations and the basic data reduction steps .",
    "section  [ datacube ] describes the line fitting procedure as well as how the galactic  was subtracted from the datacube .",

    "the flux is corrected for stray radiation entering through the sidelobes , and the continuum is subtracted from all channels before the integration with the st observations .",
    "the spatial resolution of these data is 37@xmath40353 ; all spectrometer settings were the same as for the st data .",
    "prior to mosaicing our five fields together , we perform some standard data processing steps ( processing methods are similar to those developed for the canadian galactic plane survey cgps , described in * ? ? ?",
    "first , a continuum baseline level is removed from each datacube .",
    "average emission line - free channels at both the low and high velocity ends of the cube are made , and a linear interpolation ( determined from these two continuum maps ) is then subtracted from each channel map in the datacube . to calibrate the flux scale of each cube , we compare point sources in the average of the two continuum end - channels to those in the 30  mhz continuum band map of each field ( these maps",
    "are first cleaned around the strongest sources ) .",
    "this can be done since continuum maps are flux calibrated against several strong sources that are routinely observed by the st .",
    "an error - weighted mean of the flux ratio @xmath41 for all point - sources above a cutoff level ( 20  mjy  beam@xmath0 ) is obtained ; this sample is further trimmed by rejecting sources @xmath420.5 away from the mean .",

    "the final noise values for the mosaic ( measured ) are @xmath440.85  k in the individual field centres , and @xmath440.95  k in the overlapping regions .",
    "the final step consists in merging interferometer data with single - dish ( 26-m telescope ) observations . for simplicity",

    "* ) using the procedure described below .",
    "the interferometer mosaic is first convolved to the resolution of the single - dish mosaic ; this is then subtracted from the 26-m mosaic .",
    "the resulting difference map should contain structures invisible to the interferometer , so it is added back to the full - resolution st mosaic .",
    "this procedure gives equal weight to low and high spatial frequency structures , and while it is somewhat different from the method used in the cgps ( where a tapering function weights the overlapping spatial frequencies of both maps ) , the results of both approaches are very similar for  line images .",
    "a spatial binning of 2@xmath352 pixels is finally applied to the datacube in order to decrease noise in the spectra .",
    "the datacube has a final dimension of 512@xmath35512 pixels , with a pixel size of 4375 .",
    "this angular sampling is well sufficient for the kinematical and dynamical purposes .",
    "it corresponds to 167 pc at the distance of 785 kpc .",
    "the drao synthesized beam size of @xmath45 samples a linear scale of @xmath46 pc in the  disc of messier 31 .",
    "it is as resolved as a typical  mapping of 10 mpc distant discs observed with a high resolution beam resolution of e.g. 5 .",
    "the present  observations can thus be considered as high resolution ones and for this reason no correction for beam - smearing is needed .",
    "spectra of messier 31 are known to exhibit multiple peaks in emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also the case in molecular gas observations @xcite . for the  data ,",
    "this is particulary well illustrated along position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams made parallel to the major axis in @xcite or @xcite , where a second velocity peak is seen in addition to the main ( brighter ) peak .",
    "both these lines draw a tilted figure - eight shape in which the main peak traces the usual rotating pattern of the disc ( steep velocity rise in the inner regions sometimes accompanied by a flatter velocity part in the external regions ) and the second peak shows a linear ( shallower ) velocity rise all along the slices .    with the noticeable exceptions of @xcite , @xcite or @xcite",
    ", the previous  studies of m31 analyzed their data with a single emission line approximation in order to derive an integrated emission map , a velocity field or a rotation curve .",
    "for instance , @xcite reported that when two peaks are detected , the radial velocity of the spectrum is chosen at the barycentre of the lines .",
    "though it seems a reasonable hypothesis in regard to the low spectral resolution of all these old observations , it surely provides a biased velocity distribution for m31 .",
    "integrated fluxes and velocities are uncorrectly estimated when lines are blended .",
    "a simple explanation for the origin of two components comes from the fact that the  disc of messier 31 is warped at large galactocentric radius . because the disc is highly inclined ,",
    "the projection effects enable us to cross two times the disc along the line - of - sight  (  gas is supposed to be optically thin ) .",
    "the line - of - sight  velocities are thus composed of a main component lying in the internal disc region in addition to a secondary component lying in the external warped region of the disc but seen projected at small radii .",
    "the presence of the warp were the reasons that led @xcite to analyze the wsrt data differently from the other studies by a warped and flaring  layer model .",
    "they proposed two velocity fields , one for the disc and another one for a separate , external warped structure . from this , they deduced that about 39% of the total  mass of the disc could reside beyond 18 kpc , in its warped region .",
    "a provisional study of the drao datacube has been presented in @xcite where moments maps were derived by fitting a single gaussian to each spectrum of the datacube .",
    "we extend here this simplistic view of our data to a more detailed analysis where multiple  components are now fitted to the spectra .",
    "the high - sensitivity observations indeed reveal a new more complex view of the neutral gas in m31 than what has been shown in past  studies .",
    "figure  [ fig : m31spectrafit ] displays several  spectra picked at different positions through the datacube . the  spectra exhibit almost all the time more than one component , sometimes up to 5 peaks .",
    "this result confirms the basic view shown in e.g. @xcite where two  components are shown ( and sometimes more ) , but largely extends the detection of new multiple spectral components in the datacube .",
    "one clearly wants to emphasize here that a single or two peak analysis can not apply straightforwardly to the current data .",
    "this would provide biased intensity , velocity and velocity dispersion maps .",

    "a usual problem with observations of m31 is the contamination from the mw .",
    "m31 is so massive that its receding half can reach radial velocities that coincide with those of the galaxy .",
    "however most of galactic  remains relatively easy to detect and to model because its lines can be observed almost everywhere in the field of view ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mwcontamination ] ) .",
    "we detect two major galactic lines .",
    "a first bright component is found at @xmath49 km s@xmath0  for a velocity dispersion of @xmath50 km s@xmath0  as deduced from 66000 spectra .",
    "this line does not contaminate the emission from messier 31 due to its too high radial velocity .",
    "another line is found at @xmath51 km s@xmath0  for a velocity dispersion of @xmath52 km s@xmath0 , as deduced from 19500 spectra free from m31  emission .",
    "this is the line that mostly contaminates the ne half of m31 .",
    "another minor milky way line is observed around @xmath53 km s@xmath0  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mwcontamination ] ) .",
    "this emission line does not contaminate the signal from m31 because of its high radial velocity .",
    "other very faint lines only revealed by very high contrast imaging are found around @xmath54 km s@xmath0  and @xmath55 km s@xmath0 . their contribution to",
    "the whole emission is very negligible .",
    "the method used to subtract the mw emission from the datacube is similar to the one employed by @xcite . for each channel map",
    ", a mask containing pixels with  emission of m31 is first created .",
    "the mask covers a small fraction of the field - of - view and allows to blank the  emission of m31 . a two - dimensional model of the galactic emission",
    "is then generated by fitting a 3@xmath56 order 2d - polynomial to the blanked channel map .",
    "the 2d model is then subtracted from the initial channel map .",
    "this method allows to remove most of the galactic .",
    "residual mw contamination is removed by hand during the cleaning of the multiple velocity fields ( see  [ sec : emlinesorting ] ) .",
    "we tried another approach to remove mw  by simultaneously fitting gaussian lines in addition to  from m31 .",
    "however that subtraction method had to be rejected because too many negative residuals are created in the cube , introducing artificial local minima in the integrated emission map .",
    "as claimed in @xcite it is very difficult to define whether small scale   structures observed around the disc of m31 are bound to andromeda or simply galactic cloudlets . for simplicity reasons ,",
    "we decide to ignore the gas emission out of the main disc in the following analysis .",
    "there is no clear mention in older  studies of m31 of galactic emission around @xmath57 km s@xmath0 .",
    "it is thus possible that measurements of the  flux and velocity dispersions are overstimated for the receding half of the disc in those works .",
    "however their velocity fields remain very marginally contaminated",
    ".    refers here to as the integrated weighted mean systemic velocity derived from the profile . ]",
    "the detection of emission lines is done by keeping all channels above a 3@xmath58 level , where @xmath58 is the intensity dispersion derived from half of the spectrum .",
    "this dispersion measurement is justified by the fact that most of the channels are free from  emission .",
    "the method to locate a peak in the remaining channels is a usual slope computation technique .",
    "an emission line is detected when the slope sign does not change along at least two consecutive channels , as measured both to the left and right sides of a peak .",
    "once detected , velocities and amplitudes of these peaks serve as initial guesses for the minimization step where gaussian profiles are fitted to the spectrum .",
    "a  continuum \" value is fitted as an additional parameter as well .",
    "it is very close to zero because a baseline has been subtracted in each pixel during the data reduction ( see  [ sec : datareduction ] ) .",
    "boundary constraints are applied to the parameters ( amplitude , velocity centroid and dispersion ) .",
    "a velocity centroid has to be fitted within the observed spectral range , a velocity dispersion has to be greater than one channel width and lower than an artificial ( unexpected ) large value of 130 km s@xmath0  and a peak amplitude has to be greater than zero and lower than the highest intensity observed in a spectrum .",
    "results of spectral fittings of 1 to 5  components are displayed in fig .",

    "is then applied to the data .",
    "all fitted lines whose amplitude is larger than a threshold of 3@xmath58 were kept .",
    "all lines whose velocity dispersion is greater than 60 km s@xmath0  are discarded because such high values turn out to be very rare and , above all , unrealistic .",
    "obvious residuals of mw emission are also removed from the different maps . as a result of this filtering procedure , among the 25350 available spectra in the  datacube and in which at least one component is detected with a signal - to - noise ratio of at least 3 , two peaks are detected in @xmath966% of them , three peaks in @xmath935% of them , four peaks in @xmath914% of them and five peaks in @xmath93% of them .",

    "the profile is relatively regular .",

    "there is more gas in the receding side of the galaxy than in its approaching part .",
    "an intensity - weighted systemic velocity of @xmath60 km s@xmath0  and a midpoint heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath61 km s@xmath0are derived .",
    "the measured profile widths at 20% and 50% levels are @xmath62 km s@xmath0  and @xmath63 km s@xmath0 .",

    "another modelization was done by @xcite , in which the warp starts at 18.2 kpc ( 80 ) with an increasing inclination in step of 0.75  per kpc , and a warped region rotated by 10  with respect to the central disc position angle .",

    "a first origin could be structures lying in the disc itself , like e.g. unresolved spiral arms by projection effects .",
    "indeed , the 3@xmath56 , 4@xmath139 and 5@xmath139 maps of figure  [ fig : hivf1 ] show that projection effects may play an important role in creating multiple components due to the presence of more pixels at @xmath90 than along the major axis .",

    "the drao datacube exhibit many  peaks whose radial velocity is observed to be closer to the systemic velocity than the main  disc component and whose velocity dispersion is larger than the main disc component .",

    "first , thin extensions ( called the  spurs ) are seen to the north - east and south - west .",
    "their size is @xmath309 kpc .",
    "evidence for velocity gradients in those structures are presented . then a faint , extended ( 32 kpc ) and outer  structure ( called the external arm ) is discovered .",
    "contrary to every  structures identified within the field - of - view , it has no morphological nor kinematical counterpart in the opposite side of the galaxy .",
    "its peculiar kinematics can be explained by a @xmath310 larger inclination and position angle than those of the disc .",
    "one of the  spur appears as a genuine kinematical extension of that external arm . *",
    "a tight relationship is evidenced between the  spurs and perturbed stellar structures ( the  g1 \" and north - eastern clumps ) . as possible radial outflowing motions are detected in the  spurs",
    ", we argue that the perturbed stellar and gaseous outskirts are being torn from the m31 disc .",
    "furthermore the external arm could be the vestige of a past tidal interaction , or even perhaps gas accretion onto the m31 disc . *",
    "the rotation curve is peculiar .",
    "in particular it shows a central velocity dip at 4 kpc and a rising shape in its outer part .",
    "a peak up to 340 km s@xmath0  is observed within the inner 2 kpc . except for the inner regions ,",
    "the axisymmetry of the gas rotation between the two disc halves is very good .",
    "the rotation velocity uncertainties are mostly below 10 km s@xmath0 .",
    "* between @xmath311 kpc and @xmath312 kpc a mean inclination of @xmath106 is derived for the  disc of m31 , for a mean position angle of @xmath107 .",
    "a prominent  warp is detected inside @xmath129 kpc , where the disc appears less inclined , while another external warp detected beyond @xmath313 kpc makes the disc being less inclined and then more inclined .",
    "the disc tilting is accompanied by a twist of the kinematical major axis . *",
    "the peculiar shape of the rotation curve is hardly reproduced by mass distribution models .",
    "the central velocity dip can not be modelled by any fittings .",
    "the bulge mass - to - light ratio deduced from color - based stellar synthesis models appropriate .",
    "a value close to the expected one from stellar velocity dispersion measurements provides better results .",
    "* a total stellar mass of @xmath277 @xmath3  is found .",
    "a dynamical enclosed mass of @xmath287 @xmath3  is derived at the last measured radius of the rotation curve ( @xmath314 kpc )",
    ". a dark - to - baryonic mass ratio of @xmath315 and a total gas - to - stellar mass fraction of @xmath316 are also derived inside that radius .",
    "the total mass of m31 extrapolated to its virial radius ( @xmath295 kpc ) is @xmath296 @xmath3 .",
    "both these values are consistent with those given by other works using other dynamical tracers or methods .",
    "several future works should be conducted with these data .",
    "a first crucial point will be to investigate the origin and evolution of the perturbed  outskirts - the external arm and spurs . with the help of future n - body and hydrodynamical simulations",
    ", the  kinematics should put new constraints on the mass assembly of m31 .",
    "a second challenge will be to understand the origin of the peculiar velocities in the central 4 kpc .",
    "the perturbed velocities are related to the presence of the inner warp , which has perhaps been generated by an interaction with the small companion m32 ( f. combes & f. bournaud , private communication ) and/or by the bar / boxy bulge perturbation .",
    "another work will focus on a 3d modeling of the datacube in order to study the origin of the gas components which are seen in addition to the warped disc of m31 . whether m31 contains",
    "the  anomalous \" gas from a lagging halo , as it is observed in recent deep  observations of other galaxies , is a question that should be addressed in such a model .",
    "these new results obtained for m31 could only be obtained by a combination of deep exposures with high spectral resolution measurements .",
    "the quest of understanding the formation and evolution of m31 should benefit from such deep observations .",
    "we expect that future radio observatories like the square kilometre array ( in 2016 ) and its australian and south - african precursors ( in 2013 ) will renew the vision we have of the outer  distribution and dynamics for millions of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "for the first time they will also allow to trace the evolution of the atomic gas as a function of redshift and thus the growth of the baryonic mass of milky way- and m31-like galaxies .",
    "we are very grateful to the drao staff for their support in obtaining those observations , and especially t. landecker for encouraging us to pursue this project .",
    "we are grateful to an anonymous referee whose critical comments helped improving the data analysis and the clarity of the article .",
    "we are grateful to r. braun , g. mamon , as well as m. lehnert and w. van driel at gpi for fruitful discussions , to r. kothes for thoughtful comments on the manuscript , to p. barmby for providing us with the _ spitzer / irac _ photometric profile of m31 and to c. willmer for his help in deriving the absolute magnitude of the sun for the _ spitzer / irac _ camera ( @xmath317 ) .",
