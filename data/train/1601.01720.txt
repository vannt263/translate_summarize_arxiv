    "quantum annealing seeks to solve optimization problems by taking a state of a quantum system and evolving its hamiltonian to get a desired result .",
    "quantum adiabatic optimization ( qao ) @xcite is a form of quantum annealing that seeks to keep a system in the ground state while adiabatically evolving the hamiltonian .",
    "a lot of recent work has gone into analyzing qaoin its own right @xcite and comparing qaowith classical algorithms such as simulated quantum annealing via path - integral quantum monte carlo @xcite to see how much speed - up qaocan give if any .",
    "it has been conjectured that a large part of qao s power comes from the ability of quantum systems to tunnel through potential barriers . in this article , we focus on an @xmath0-qubit hamiltonian , but by making it symmetric in the qubits , we can effectively reduce our problem to a one - dimensional tunneling problem .",
    "this setup of one - dimensional tunneling in @xmath0 symmetric qubits has been studied before by farhi , goldstone , and gutmann @xcite who considered tunneling through a constant width spike of height @xmath0 and who showed for this setting a gap scaling of @xmath10 .",
    "reichardt @xcite showed that qaocan tunnel in constant time ( @xmath11 ) provided that the area ( width @xmath12 height ) of the barrier is bounded by @xmath13 .",
    "more recently , crosson and deng @xcite examined thin barriers of varying height , and kong and crosson @xcite found that sufficiently large barriers lead to exponential run - times .",
    "jiang et al .",
    "@xcite showed that quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) can reproduce the exponential run - time behavior of thermally assisted quantum tunnelling through such large barriers .",
    "independently the current authors have numerically found @xcite that the transitions between constant , polynomial , and exponential run - time scaling for qmcsimulations coincide with the same transitions for qao .    in this article , we consider barriers with width proportional to @xmath2 and height proportional to @xmath3 and mainly focus on barriers with @xmath14 , which is above reichardt s @xcite constant scaling region , and @xmath15 which is below kong ond crosson s @xcite exponential scaling region .",
    "we show that barriers in this intermediate size regime lead to polynomial scaling of the minimum spectral gap with @xmath16 . through the quantum adiabatic theorem",
    "this scaling implies that a polynomial running time is sufficient for the qaoalgorithm to tunnel through such barriers .",
    "additionally , our method also confirms kong and crosson s exponential scaling and provides an exact form for the polynomial prefactor on the exponential .    in section [ sec : ham ] , we present our problem and discuss the hamiltonian governing the interactions of our @xmath0-qubit system .",
    "section [ sec : ana_gap ] presents details of previous work on this problem and highlight both the polynomial scaling region between @xmath4 and @xmath15 where few solid results have been published and the unexplored region for @xmath17 .",
    "our problem lends itself to a large spin analysis using either spin coherent states @xcite or the villain transformation @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : large_spin ] briefly touches on spin coherent states , which have been used to analyze this problem before @xcite , and presents an in depth analysis using the villain transformation , resulting in a semi - classical hamiltonian that describes our dynamics for large @xmath0 .",
    "focusing on just the critical region of the problem where the spectral gap is smallest , section [ sec : quad_app ] derives a model that approximates the semi - classical hamiltonian in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "we provide several arguments for why this model accurately represents the asymptotic behavior of our original problem .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : asymp ] , we use this model to derive an exact asymptotic expression for the scaling behavior of the spectral gap .",
    "our main goal is to explore quantum tunneling through a barrier in a symmetric cost function @xmath1 defined on the @xmath0-dimensional hypercube @xmath18 .",
    "our specific cost function is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hamming weight of the length @xmath0 bit string @xmath21 .",
    "the barrier function , @xmath22 , is some function that is localized around @xmath23 and has width proportional to @xmath24 and height proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "we describe these barriers using the notation @xmath26 .    to create an algorithm to minimize the cost function , we first encode it into a quantum hamiltonian on @xmath0 qubits : @xmath27    qaostarts the system in a different hamiltonian with known and easily prepared ground state ; the typical starting hamiltonian applies a magnetic field in the @xmath28 direction so that @xmath29    the ground state of @xmath30 is an equal superposition of all states @xmath31 , which corresponds to a binomial distribution in hamming weight .",
    "then , qaofinds the ground state of @xmath32 by slowly evolving the system from @xmath30 into @xmath32 using @xmath33 and the quantum adiabatic theorem says that the system will stay in the ground state if @xmath34 varies slowly enough . in order to ensure adiabaticity the evolution time , @xmath35 , must scale depending on both the norm of @xmath36 and the inverse of the minimum spectral gap between the two smallest eigenvalues @xmath37 and @xmath38 of @xmath39 : @xmath40}\\left(\\lambda_1(s)-\\lambda_0(s)\\right).\\ ] ] historically , sources @xcite have claimed that the adiabatic theorem requires @xmath41 recent work @xcite has shown that the adiabatic condition may be a more complicated function of these parameters , but all of this recent work has the running time scaling like an inverse polynomial in @xmath42 .",
    "since the norm of the hamiltonian s derivative is usually independent of parameters such as our @xmath43 and @xmath44 , typically the gap is taken as the important part of this expression .",
    "therefore , the key issue of this paper is the calculation of @xmath42 .",
    "the hamiltonian , @xmath39 , on @xmath0 qubits can be simplified by considering just the symmetric subspace . for each hamming weight @xmath45 , the hamiltonian is degenerate on the subspace of @xmath46 , so there will only be one degenerate energy level for each hamming weight @xmath47 .",
    "this symmetry can be utilized to rewrite the full @xmath48 hamiltonian as an @xmath49 symmetric hamiltonian : @xmath50{|h\\rangle}{\\langle h|}\\nonumber\\\\              -&\\frac{(1-s)}{2}\\sum_{h=0}^{n-1 }                    \\sqrt{(h+1)(n - h)}{|h\\rangle}{\\langle h+1|}\\nonumber\\\\               -&\\frac{(1-s)}{2}\\sum_{h=0}^{n-1 }                    \\sqrt{(h+1)(n - h)}{|h+1\\rangle}{\\langle h|}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when @xmath51 , the ground state of the symmetric hamiltonian is explicitly @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the unperturbed spectrl gap .",
    "this distribution is a binomial for @xmath54 , and the width remains proportional to @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "the maximum amplitude @xmath57 state here corresponds with the zero amplitude state in the first excited state and can be thought of as the center of the distribution .",
    "the center coincides with @xmath58 when @xmath59 .    in the large @xmath0 limit with a non - zero barrier ,",
    "@xmath60 becomes extremely narrow relative to the dimension of the hilbert space , so for most @xmath61 values , the energy states are unaffected by the barrier .",
    "it is only when the energy states get close to the barrier that the perturbation becomes important .",
    "therefore , in the large @xmath0 limit , the location of the minimum spectral gap becomes this critical @xmath62 .",
