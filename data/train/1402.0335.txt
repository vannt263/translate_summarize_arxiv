    "manipulation of the entanglement dynamics between the qubit and light field has become a significantly important issue for both the fundamental quantum theories and experiments @xcite , where reliable quantum information processing ( qip ) and computation rely on coherent manipulation of physically realizable systems in which information is stored and by means of which information is processed or transmitted . however , only the dynamics in a qubit - field system where the field evolves in low - dimensional subspace is analytically easy to handle .",

    "there may exist two common modulations , i.e. , the hopping strength between the cv systems and the detuning in the jc interaction .",
    "previous efforts typically concentrate on the entanglement dynamics between a pair of non - local qubits and the spatially separate cv systems , where the dynamics is analytically solvable based on separate jc models .",
    "the coupled - cavity system involving two non - local qubits and the coupled thermal fields has been investigated under hopping and detuning modulations , which can exhibit interesting features , such as maximal qubit - qubit entanglement generation and freezing @xcite .",
    "however , the dynamics involving two non - local qubits and the coupled cv systems has not been extensively investigated due to their infinite - dimension hilbert space and complicated mutual - interaction processes when considering the hopping between the cv systems . to our knowledge ,",
    "a convincingly analytical treatment of the dynamics between two non - local qubits and the coupled cv systems is still absent , which is relevant with the recent progresses in the arrays of interacting micro - cavities and their coupling to qubits @xcite .    in this paper",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of two qubits separately sent through two coupled resonators , each initially containing a coherent state field . </S>",
    "<S> we present analytical arguments and numerical calculations for the qubit - field system under different two - qubit initial states , photon hopping strengths , and detunings . in far off - resonant regime </S>",
    "<S> , the maximal entanglement of two qubits can be generated with the initial qubit state in which one qubit is in the excited state and the other is in the ground state , and the initially maximal two - qubit entanglement can be frozen and fully revived even for large mean photon number . when the qubits are both initially in their excited states or ground states , the qubit - qubit entanglement birth and death apparently appear in the regime where the photon hopping strength is close to qubit - field detuning , and its peaks do not decrease monotonically as the interaction time increases . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to observe that when there is photon hopping strength between two fields , the field - field entanglement can be larger than one and increases as the initial amplitude of the coherent state grows . by postselecting the fields both in their coherent states , </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement of two initially unentangled qubits can be largely improved . </S>",
    "<S> our present setup is fundamental for the distributed quantum information processing and applicable to different physical qubit - resonator systems . </S>"
