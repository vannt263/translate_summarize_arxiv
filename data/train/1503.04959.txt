    "conventional continuous quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) are driven by pure quantum fluctuation effects due to the change of external parameters and generally described in terms of the spontaneous symmetry breaking and order parameters of the ground state @xcite .",

    "different topological states are classified by topological quantum numbers , which take discrete numbers , in contrast to order parameters used in conventional qpts to distinguish various phases , which generally take continuous values .",
    "conventionally , continuous qpts can be classified into different order qpts by singularity properties of the ground - state energy at the phase transition point ( or critical point for @xmath0 ) , i.e. , @xmath1th order qpts are characterized by discontinuities in the @xmath1th derivative of the ground - state energy .    as the singularity of ground - state energy plays an important role in determining universal properties around the critical point of the qpt , however it can not distinguish whether the phase transition is a topological qpt or a conventional one within the landau - ginzburg paradigm @xcite . beyond the traditional energy criterion",
    ", a qpt can be also witnessed by qualitative changes of physical quantities related to the ground - state wavefunctions , e.g. , the berry phase @xcite , quantum fidelity and the fidelity susceptibility @xcite , and the quantum geometric tensor @xcite .",
    "although these approaches have shed light on our understanding of qpts from the geometric aspect of the ground - state manifold , one can not identify a qpt to be a topological or trivial one solely from the singularity of particular physical quantities at the phase transition point unless additional quantities related to the topological invariant are calculated . an interesting question arising here",
    "is whether we can characterize a qpt is topological or conventional phase transition from the property of the phase transition point ?    to answer the question ,",
    "let us recall that a topological qpt distinguished from a trivial one is manifested by the change of topological invariant , instead of symmetry breaking , across the transition point . while the topological invariant , e.g. , the quantized berry phase for one - dimensional ( 1d ) topological systems @xcite or chern number for two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum hall systems @xcite , is well defined for a gapped phase apart from the qpt point and characterizes the global geometrical property of the bloch band , it fails to work at the gapless critical point . to overcome the difficulty , in this work we propose an alternative definition for the topological invariant , which is not defined on the momentum space at the transition point , but via a closed detour path surrounding the critical point on the parameter space spanning by both the momentum and the transition driving parameter . by applying this idea to the 1d and 2d topological systems , e.g. , the celebrated su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model and haldane model",
    ", we demonstrate these topological invariants taking nontrivial quantized numbers for topological qpts , but some non - universal numbers or zero number for conventional qpts .",
    "our results suggest that we can judge topological or trivial qpts from topological properties of the phase transition points .",
    "we begin our discussion with one of the simplest 1d topological systems , the ssh model @xcite , which can be described by the hamiltonian : @xmath2+h.c.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the creation operator of fermion on @xmath4-th a ( or b ) sublattice .",
