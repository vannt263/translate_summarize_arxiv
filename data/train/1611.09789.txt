    "opal - based materials attracted great attention of researchers over the several decades due to their unique properties , ease of fabrication and potentiality for large variety of applications .",
    "the optical properties of opals are strongly determined by the lattice configuration including its period , refractive index and orientation .",
    "opals having photonic stop - bands in the visible range demonstrate shimmered interference colors .",
    "this fact not only provokes interest in opals from the viewpoint of jewellery but makes them promising for colorimetric sensors @xcite , solar cells @xcite and microdisplays @xcite .",
    "the spectral position of the photonic stop - bands can be effectively tuned by mechanical deformation of the photonic crystal lattice @xcite or by applying the electrokinetic force for reshaping the opaline particles @xcite .",
    "another way to change the optical properties of opal is to control the geometry and composition of its surface . as it was demonstrated in ref .",
    ", the presence of gold film terminating the opaline photonic crystal lattice leads to modification of angular transmission diagram owing to the coupling of the diffracted light to surface plasmon polaritons . in refs .",
    "it was shown that the unstructured silicon interfacial layer between the air and two - dimensional photonic crystal can give rise to tamm - like surface states that modify the optical reflection of such structure in the spectral region of the photonic stop - band .",
    "very recently , the optical tamm states were demonstrated in transmission and reflectance spectra of three - dimensional opal photonic crystals coated by thin metal films @xcite .",
    "these tamm states provide the bypass for light at the edges of the bragg diffraction resonances and reduce the diffraction efficiency . besides of that , the configuration of opal surface was demonstrated to play an important role in the second harmonic generation @xcite and the point imaging by opal slab with negative refraction @xcite .",
    "the authors of refs . described the optical properties of opal based structures impregnated or covered with materials which undergo a phase transition .",
    "the reflection spectra of such structures were considered in terms of resonant wood s anomalies and 3d bragg diffraction . from the viewpoint of practical applications",
    ", it would be interesting to study the optical response of these structures at different phase states of the capping layer .",
    "the goal of the present work is to study the optical reflection of opal structures covered with well - known phase - change material ge@xmath0sb@xmath0te@xmath1 ( gst225 ) @xcite .",
    "we are aiming to describe the reflection spectra and optical resonances of the structure by means of the scattering matrix formalism @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we describe our hybrid gst225/opal structures , their fabrication technique and the experimental setup . in sec .",
    "[ sec : calc ] , we give a brief description of the scattering matrix method and the way how we approximate the structure to simulate our experimental results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim ] , we present the results of measurements of reflection spectra as well as the results of numerical simulations .",
    "we show that the reflection spectra have the wood s anomalies and the 3d photonic stop - band peak and analyse their behaviour with increase of the angle of light incidence .",
    "we also calculate the electromagnetic near - field distribution of the light which is coming in to the sample from free space . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we propose a simple model in order to describe the observed reflection spectra in terms of lorentzian functions .",
    "the samples of the hybrid structures under study consist of 1 and 16 monolayers of amorphous silica spheres of diameter @xmath2645 nm grown on fused silica substrate and covered by a gst225 film of @xmath2110 nm thickness ( see fig.[sample]a , b ) .",
    "the _ fcc _ opaline lattice of spheres was grown from water suspension of amorphouse sio@xmath0 particles by the vertical deposition technique @xcite .",
    "a spread in diameter of spheres was smaller than 5% .",
    "the amorphous gst225 layer was deposited on the surface of opal films in vacuum by the thermal deposition technique at a substrate temperature of 50@xmath3c , an evaporator temperature of 600@xmath3c , and a residual pressure of 10@xmath4pa @xcite .    in optical measurements",
    ", the light of an incandescent lamp hits the structure at an incident angle @xmath5 changing from 11@xmath3 to 66@xmath3 with a step of 5@xmath3 .",
    "the azimuthal orientation of the samples was set using the 2d optical diffraction pattern @xcite from the hexagonally ordered opal surface .",
    "the following condition was satisfied : the incidence plane passed through one of the three equivalent pairs of sites of the hexagonal reciprocal lattice : ( -11 ) ( 1 - 1 ) ; ( 01 ) ( 0 - 1 ) ; ( -10 ) ( 10 ) .",
    "the specular reflectance spectra were measured in the 9001700 nm wavelength range with an ocean optics nir 512 spectrometer equipped with an ingaas - based charge - coupled device ( ccd ) array detector .",

    "model m-2000 '' .",
    "the reflection spectra of hybrid structures are calculated using the scattering matrix method ( smm ) @xcite .",
    "the scattering matrix method is based on splitting a structure into elementary planar layers , homogeneous in z direction and 2d periodic in x and y directions . in this splitting ,",
    "the circular cross section of each sphere is approximated by a staircase .",
    "the solutions of maxwell s equations for each layer are found by expansion of the electric and magnetic fields into floquet - fourier modes ( plane waves ) .",
    "the exact solution can be presented as an infinite series over these modes , in the limit of infinite number of steps per each sphere . in numerical simulations ,",
    "the scattering matrices are determined by taking a finite number of stairs per sphere diameter , @xmath8 , and by truncating the fourier series on a finite number of plane waves @xmath9 . the calculation accuracy increases with an increasing @xmath8 and @xmath9 ,",
    "however , calculation time is proportional to @xmath8 and @xmath10 respectively . in order to improve the convergence",
    ", we implemented the li s factorization rules @xcite . as a result",
    ", we used 13 plane waves in both x and y directions so that the total number of plane waves was @xmath11 .",
    "the number of stairs per diameter was @xmath12 in what follows .",
    "in addition , the choice of proper model of the geometry of gst225 capping layer is an important issue .",
    "it will be seen later that a so - called crescent model adequately describes the influence of the capping layer on the reflection properties of structures in study .",
    "the dispersion of refractive index of gst225 is measured using the ellipsometry technique and takes the imaginary part into account ( see fig.[sample]c ) .",
    "refraction index of opal spheres is determined from the analysis of bragg reflection spectra of the initial opal film ( denoted as opal silica in fig.[sample]b ) and is taken as 1.92 and is assumed to be independent on the wavelength @xcite .        .",

    "the color scales are shown on the right . ]",
    "the theoretical and experimental reflection coefficients of structures under study collected at different angles of incidence in te and tm polarizations are shown in fig.[spectra ] as two - dimensional function of photon energy and incident angle .",
    "in particular , fig.[spectra]a shows the theoretical reflection spectra of 1 monolayer of silica spheres covered by gst225 film .",
    "one can see that the spectra have two peaks which are redshifted with increase of the incident angle .",
    "we will show later that these peaks constitute the wood s anomalies corresponding to two different quasi - guided modes .",
    "the analysis of these spectra shows that at sufficiently large incident angles ( @xmath14 ) the spectra are quite well described by the lorentzian functions whose widths decrease monotonically with increasing the angle @xmath5 . at small enough angles",
    "@xmath5 the reflection spectra are strongly deformed and take an asymmetrical form , so that it becomes impossible to differ between separate peaks in the interaction region .",
    "the value of the reflection coefficient at peak positions ( for the light reflected in a small spatial angle ) also monotonically increase with decreasing the angle @xmath5 , reaching its maximum at normal incidence ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "at very small angles @xmath5 the wood s anomalies merge into a broad irregular contour .    the theoretical reflection spectra of 16 monolayer hybrid structure show up the peaks of the similar shape and the same spectral position ( see fig.[spectra]b ) along with the reflection maxima associated with photonic stop - band and the fabry - prot interference over the structure thickness .",
    "the similar behaviour is observed in te polarization ( see figs.[spectra]c , d ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the theoretical and experimental spectra ( see figs.[spectra]e , g , f , h ) are in good agreement with each other .    in order to trace the influence of the gst225 film thickness",
    ", we calculated the reflection spectra of hybrid structure with @xmath16 , 110 and 150 nm ( see fig.[refh ] ) .",
    "it can be seen from fig.[refh ] that the spectra have the photonic stop - bands , the fabry - perot resonances as well as the wood s peaks .",
    "the wood s peaks are redshifted with increase of the gst film thickness while the photonic stop - band position and fabry - perot resonances are practically not affected by gst225 film thickness .",
    "the analysis of the reflection spectra made in the previous section suggests that the reflection peaks such as those in fig.[spectra]a originate from the interface layer of the hybrid structure . in order to understand the origin of electromagnetic resonances in greater detail , the poles of the scattering matrix as a function of complex frequency @xmath17 and @xmath18 have to be found @xcite .",
    "the poles define the energy dispersion of the eigenmodes @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 are the @xmath21 projections of the momentum vector of the incident wave .",
    "however , it appears that in this particular case the eigenmode dispersion can be found with a good accuracy from a simplified in - plane homogenized problem in the empty lattice approximation @xcite . in this approximation",
    ", the dispersion relation is calculated for the new effective structure consisting of homogeneous isotropic layers corresponding to the consecutive steps of the staircase representation of the hybrid structure .",
    "the effective dielectric permittivities of these layers are calculated by the effective medium theory : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the dielectric permittivity of @xmath24-th component in a layer , @xmath25 is the filling factor of @xmath24-th component .    the approximate matrix @xmath26 can be represented in the form of a 2@xmath272 matrix . to account for the surface periodicity ,",
    "the obtained dispersion curves are then folded back on the @xmath28 diagram into the first brillouin zone .",
    "the dispersion relations of eigenmodes of 1 monolayer of silica spheres covered by 110 nm gst225 film are shown in fig.[disp ] .",
    "the fig.[disp]a shows the dispersion curves of the effective non - periodic structure .",
    "the modes above the vacuum light line are the fabry - perot resonances .",
    "they have relatively large bandwidth ( imaginary part of eigenfrequency ) due to the energy leakage to the far field .",
    "in contrast to that , the modes below the substrate light line ( denoted as a and b ) are not coupled to the far field and , therefore , have the smaller bandwidth and longer lifetime . in this case , the non - zero imaginary part of eigenfrequency is originated from the light absorption in gst225 .",
    "the modes a have longer lifetimes in comparison to the lifetimes of the modes b because the extinction coefficient of gst225 , im@xmath29 $ ] , at 900mev is smaller than that at 1350mev ( see fig.[sample]c ) . in fig.[disp ] , the stripes indicating the imaginary parts of eigenenergies of modes a are very narrow and are not visible to the naked eye .",
    "let us now account for the periodicity and fold the dispersion curves shown in fig.[disp]a into the first brillouin zone ( see fig.[disp]b ) .",
    "the obtained eigenmodes a@xmath30 and b@xmath30 have now a negative dispersion . in order to compare the displayed dispersion curves with the experimental reflection spectra we plot the area bounded by the dashed green line in fig.[disp]b in @xmath31 coordinates ( see fig.[disp]c ) .",
    "the comparison between the dispersion curves in fig[disp]c and the reflection spectra in fig.[spectra]a reveals that the tm reflection maxima at @xmath32mev and @xmath33mev are associated with the tm modes a and b. the other modes are not seen in the spectra as they have very large bandwidth .",
    "the correspondence between the reflection spectrum in te polarization and the te modes a and b is not so good .",
    "the reason for this is maybe a stronger optical strength of the resonances , stronger interaction between the quasiguided and fabry - perot modes resulting in larger deviations from the empty lattice approximation @xcite .      in order to visualize the modes described above ,",
    "let us calculate the near - field distribution in the hybrid structures .",
    "we limit our discussion to the mode a , gst225 layer thickness @xmath34 nm and tm polarization .",
    "the spatial distribution of the amplitude of electric field oscillations in the 1 monolayer structure covered by gst225 film is shown in fig.[fields ] for @xmath35 nm and @xmath36 . these wavelength and angle of incidence correspond to the position of the dip in the reflection spectrum shown in fig.[spectra]a .",
    "it can be seen in fig.[fields]a that the electric field is localized in the near - surface region and represents mostly a standing wave . in the antinodes ,",
    "the field reaches a maximum which is almost 3.5 higher than the field of incoming wave . a field modulation coefficient , i.e. the ratio between the maximal and minimal electric field energies over the period of electromagnetic oscillation exceeds unity by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this is also characteristic of the standing wave of the surface mode .",
    "the spatial distributions of electric field calculated in two horizontal cross sections are shown in figs.[fields]b , c .",
    "it can be seen , that the electric field is mainly localized in the air gaps between the silica spheres .",
    "the analysis of the eigenmodes dispersion curves and the electric near - field distributions reveals that the peaks in the reflection spectra are attributed to the appearance of the quasi - guided modes @xcite . strictly speaking , these modes are the fano resonances which are known to have the asymmetric line - shape @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the assymetry is weak and the reflection peaks can also be described in terms of a lorentzian function .",
    "figure[example ] shows as an example the reflection spectra for the angle @xmath37 approximated by lorentzian curves .",
    "since the maximum of the peaks greatly exceeds the value of the reflection coefficient at some distance from the resonances ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , this situation resembles the one seen in the case of the light reflection from a two - dimensional periodic array of objects demonstrating a resonant response in the absence of dielectric contrast , e.g. , associated with excitons in isolated or tunnel - coupled quantum dots @xcite .",
    "relying on this analogy one can write the transmission coefficient for a hybrid structure as @xmath40 , and taking into account the relation @xmath41 , one gets that @xmath42 .",
    "further , the reflection coefficient can be presented as a sum of the pole terms @xmath43 , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the resonant frequency and radiative damping rate of the j - th resonance . as a result ,",
    "one can obtain the following expression for the reflection coefficient : @xmath47the last expression can be recast into the form to take the the absorption into consideration    @xmath48    where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are some real constants .",
    "alternatively , equation ( 4 ) can be derived by considering a multipath interference from @xmath52 resonances .    , which demonstrates the wood s anomalies ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) corresponding to two close quasi - guided modes .",
    "the extrapolation of the spectrum is made by equation ( [ eq1 ] ) ( red line ) . ]",
    "the extrapolation of the reflection spectra shown in fig.[example ] by equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , where the frequency @xmath17 is expressed in terms of energy ( @xmath55 $ ] ) , gives the following fitting parameters : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "some discrepancy in the description of the experimental spectrum can be attributed to a difference of the spectral shape for the second mode of wood s anomaly from the lorentzian shape ( due to a large broadening of the peak ) and to the frequency dependence of the phase shift due to a difference in the spatial locations of the quasi - guided modes in the near - surface region .",
    "in conclusion , we have suggested the model of hybrid photonic crystal structure where the vertical cross section of gst225 capping layer has the crescent - like shape .",
    "it enables us to theoretically describe the wood s anomalies in the reflection spectra of hybrid structures .",
    "the corresponding quasi - guided modes are localized in the air gaps between silica spheres in the near - surface region .",
    "the measured reflection spectra of such structures are in a quantitative agreement with the simulation results obtained by the scattering matrix method .",
    "one can expect that the suggested model is sufficient for prediction of optical properties other opal - based structures as well as the effect of the phase transition of gst225 capping layer .",
    "the potential practical applications of such structures include the development of promising elements for all - optical switches , filters , and multiplexers .",
    "although the described resonances are in the near - infrared spectral region , the sensitivity of the reflection spectra to the gst225 capping layer paths new way for the color management and the light control",
