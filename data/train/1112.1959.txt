    "recently t2k have published evidence for a large non - zero reactor angle @xcite which , when combined with data from minos and other experiments in a global fit yields @xcite , _",
    "13=8 ^ 1.5^ , where the reactor angle is defined in the usual pdg convention @xcite and the errors indicate the one @xmath5 range , although the statistical significance of a non - zero reactor angle is about  3@xmath5 .",
    "a non - zero reactor angle is also consistent with the first results from double chooz  @xcite .",
    "if confirmed , these recent observations would rule out _ conventional _ tri - bimaximal ( tb ) mixing which predicts a zero reactor angle  @xcite .",
    "many alternative proposals  @xcite have been put forward since the first t2k results , all aiming to accommodate a non - zero @xmath0 .",
    "typically , such models also yield ( sizable ) deviations to the other predictions of tb mixing , namely tri - maximal solar mixing @xmath6 and maximal atmospheric mixing @xmath7 . however ,",
    "since the latter remain in good agreement with current global fits @xcite , it would be nice if , somehow , these good predictions of tb mixing could be maintained while at the same time allowing a non - zero reactor angle .",
    "in fact the idea of maintaining the tb predictions for the solar and atmospheric angles , while switching on the reactor angle , was suggested some time ago ( before t2k results ) by one of us and was referred to as tri - bimaximal - reactor ( tbr ) mixing @xcite .",
    "the tbr ansatz @xcite postulates a free reactor angle @xmath0 but with fixed @xmath8 and @xmath9 corresponding to tri - maximal solar mixing @xmath10 and maximal atmospheric mixing @xmath7 . in the pdg convention for the pmns mixing matrix @xcite the tbr ansatz for the mixing matrix",
    "is then @xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 contains the usual majorana phases .",
    "note that tbr mixing reduces to tb mixing in the limit that @xmath13 .",
    "however in general tbr mixing involves an arbitrary reactor angle @xmath0 which could in principle be large , without causing any deviations from tb solar and atmospheric mixing @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the tbr ansatz in eq .",
    "is clearly very simple to write down .",
    "the obvious question is whether there is any model that can give rise to tbr mixing .",
    "such a model of tbr mixing should also explain the smallness of the reactor angle @xmath0 as compared to the tri - maximal solar mixing angle @xmath10 and the maximal atmospheric mixing angle @xmath7 .",
    "at the same time that the tbr ansatz was proposed , a mechanism was suggested called partially constrained sequential dominance ( pcsd ) which could lead to tbr mixing @xcite .",
    "although no actual model was proposed , it was shown how pcsd could originate due to a distortion of the vacuum alignment which was previously used to account for tb mixing via constrained sequential dominance ( csd ) , which in turn could originate from @xmath4 family symmetry @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose the first explicit @xmath4 model of leptons based on the type  i seesaw mechanism at both the effective and the renormalisable level which , together with vacuum alignment , leads to pcsd and hence tbr mixing .",
    "to understand the approach we are following in this paper , it is useful to first recall the csd approach to tb mixing .",
    "the basic ingredients there are sequential dominance ( sd ) @xcite and vacuum alignment . the strategy of combining sd with vacuum alignment is familiar from the csd approach to tb mixing @xcite where a neutrino mass hierarchy is assumed and the dominant and subdominant flavons responsible for the atmospheric and solar neutrino masses are aligned in the directions of the second and third columns of the tb mixing matrix , namely @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the idea of pcsd @xcite is to simply maintain the subdominant flavon alignment , @xmath16 , while considering a small perturbation @xmath17 to the dominant flavon alignment , @xmath18 .",
    "assuming pcsd , with a strong neutrino mass hierarchy , @xmath19 , leads to a perturbed neutrino mass matrix @xmath20 @xcite , m_= _ _ 2__2^t + ^t , [ quadratic ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the leading order neutrino mass eigenvalues .",
    "the explicit @xmath4 models we propose involve the accurate flavon alignments @xmath16 and @xmath18 which appear quadratically and reproduce the neutrino mass matrix as in eq .   quite accurately in the case of the renormalisable model .",
    "another important result of our paper concerns the analytic diagonalisation of the neutrino mass matrix in eq .",
    "to second order  @xmath23 .",
    "previously it has been shown that , to leading order in @xmath24 and @xmath17 , eq .",
    "leads to tbr mixing in eq .",
    "( [ tbr ] ) @xcite .",
    "remarkably , we find that the coefficients of the second order corrections to the mixing angles are suppressed , making the approximate tbr mixing resulting from eq .   to be more accurate than expected .",
    "thus the renormalisable @xmath4 model predicts surprisingly accurate tbr mixing with @xmath1 , @xmath2 even for quite sizeable @xmath0 .",
    "we note that pcsd is based on the general approach to model building known as the _ indirect _ approach @xcite which involves the quadratic appearance of the flavons as in eq .  .",
    "recently an alternative type of model of tbr mixing has been proposed based on @xmath25 family symmetry , with a type  i plus type  ii seesaw mechanism , although no detailed model was proposed and the necessary vacuum alignment was not studied @xcite .",
    "moreover , tbr mixing does not follow in a general way from the model in @xcite , but only occurs for special choices of parameters .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec - a4model ]",
    "we propose an explicit @xmath4 model of leptons at both the effective and the renormalisable level which , together with vacuum alignment , leads to pcsd and hence tbr mixing . in section [ sec - tbr ] we give the results of the analytic diagonalisation of the neutrino mass matrix in eq .",

    "in this section we present the details of the @xmath4 model , first at the effective , then at the renormalisable level .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , our models follow the indirect approach and the aligned flavons appear quadratically in the light neutrino mass matrix  @xmath28 as in eq .. in order to achieve this via the type i see - saw mechanism , and to ensure a diagonal charged lepton mass matrix , additional @xmath29 shaping symmetries are also employed . in such models ,",
    "the discrete family symmetry is pivotal in two aspects : it ( @xmath30 ) helps generate the required flavon alignments and ( @xmath31 ) combines the three generations into multiplets of the group so that , together with the corresponding product rules , one obtains mass matrices which depend on only a few free parameters . in this paper",
    "we choose to work with @xmath4 as it is the smallest non - abelian finite group with an irreducible triplet representation .",

    "[ antusch - plot ] which illustrates the stability of the atmospheric and solar angles as the reactor angle is switched on .",
    "it is worth emphasising that the @xmath4 models are _ indirect _ models involving the quadratic appearance of misaligned flavons as in eq .  .",
    "moreover there is no simple klein symmetry that is respected by this mass matrix ; in fact , formally , the generators of the klein symmetry involve the real order one parameter @xmath99 of eq .",
    ", thus proving the absence of a _ direct _ link between the @xmath4 family symmetry and the klein symmetry of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "nevertheless , the alignments of the flavons can readily originate from a simple discrete symmetry such as @xmath4 , which is broken in a rather complicated way in the neutrino sector , although the charged lepton sector is diagonal in the model of leptons considered here .    in a more complete @xmath4 family unified model , for example based on @xmath100",
    ", one would expect the charged lepton sector to be related to the off - diagonal quark mass matrices , resulting in additional charged lepton corrections to the lepton mixing angles , together with renormalisation group ( rg ) corrections , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "however it is worth emphasising that , typically , such corrections to mixing angles are not expected to exceed about 3@xmath101 from charged lepton corrections and about 1@xmath101 from rg corrections @xcite .",
    "such corrections are not sufficient to account for the observed reactor angle , although they may affect the predictions of tbr mixing discussed here , which strictly apply to the unrenormalised neutrino mixing angles only .",
    "we are very grateful to stefan antusch for generously creating and donating the figure , as well as for helpful correspondence .",
    "the authors acknowledge support from the stfc rolling grant no .",

    "in this appendix we present the results of the mixing angles and phases for the more general case with _ three _ non - zero mass parameters @xmath103 .",
    "the starting point is the pcsd form of neutrino mass matrix with non - vanishing @xmath104 , namely , m _  =               .",
    "[ m - analytic - m1 ] clearly , in the limit @xmath105 , this reduces to the pcsd form of neutrino mass matrix considered in eq .   and section [ sec - tbr ] .",
    "adopting the notation of section  [ sec - tbr ] and assuming the hierarchy |m^0_1|",
    "=  k_1 |m^0_3|  , |m^0_2|  =  k_2 |m^0_3|  , with @xmath106 being coefficients of order one or smaller , we obtain to second order in @xmath75 , _",

    "the resulting neutrino masses read m_^  =   ( m_1,m_2,m_3 )  =   ( k_1 , k_2 , 1 + ) |m^0_3|  .",
    "note that @xmath107 can be of same order in @xmath75 as @xmath108 without changing the mixing matrix to first order in @xmath75 .",
    "that is even with @xmath109 being of order one , we still find tbr mixing .",
    "considering , however , the case where @xmath110 is additionally suppressed by one or more powers of @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath111 , the above expressions simplify considerably .",
    "then , in fact , the @xmath109 dependence drops out completely to second order in @xmath75 , and we recover the expressions of section  [ sec - tbr ] , with @xmath112 corresponding to @xmath113 and @xmath114 set to zero .",
