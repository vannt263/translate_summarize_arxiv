    "absorbing phase transition ( apt ) are a particular class of non - equilibrium phase transitions occurring in physical , biological , as well as chemical systems ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "transitions to absorbing states are of particular interest since they have no equilibrium counterparts and may occur even in one - dimensional systems .",
    "a characteristic feature of absorbing phase transitions is the competition between the proliferation and annihilation of a certain entity  @xmath0 , e.g. , particles , energy units , viruses , molecules in catalytic reactions , etc .",
    "it is essential that no spontaneous creation of such quantities takes place . at a critical value of the proliferation - annihilation rate",
    "the density @xmath1 vanishes and the system is trapped forever in the absorbing state @xmath2 .",
    "directed percolation is recognized as a paradigmatic example of absorbing phase transitions .",
    "this is reflected by the universality hypothesis of janssen and grassberger that models which exhibit a continuous phase transition to a single absorbing state generally belong to the universality class of directed percolation  @xcite .",
    "different universality classes occur for instance in the presence of additional symmetries .",
    "in particular , particle conservation may lead to the different universality class of absorbing phase transitions with a conserved field as pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "for instance the conserved lattice gas ( clg )  @xcite , the conserved threshold transfer process ( cttp )  @xcite , the well known manna sandpile model  @xcite , as well as a reaction - diffusion model  @xcite belong to this universality class  @xcite . note that this universality class is of particular interest since the corresponding systems connect the critical behavior of the absorbing phase transition with the critical steady state of self - organized critical ( soc ) systems  @xcite",
    "actually , soc sandpile models can be considered as driven - dissipative versions of ( closed ) systems exhibiting absorbing phase transitions  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the universal finite - size scaling as well as the universal dynamical scaling behavior of the clg model , the cttp , and the manna model .",
    "first we introduce a method that allows to study finite - size effects in the steady state .",
    "in contrast to previous attempts to measure finite - size effects our method is well defined .",
    "furthermore it can be applied immediately to other classes of absorbing phase transitions .",
    "second we consider the activity spreading of a single active seed .",
    "the corresponding spreading exponents are naturally connected to the avalanche exponents of soc systems  @xcite . in particular",
    "we discuss certain hyperscaling laws relating the spreading exponents to the steady state exponents of absorbing phase transitions .",
    "this allows us to express the soc avalanche exponents in terms of the exponents of the corresponding absorbing phase transition ( e.g. the exponents of the order parameter , the correlation length exponent , etc . ) .",
    "thus the critical state of soc systems is closely related to the critical properties of an ordinary second order phase transition .",
    "the first considered model is the conserved lattice gas ( clg )  @xcite which is a stochastic variant of a model introduced by jensen  @xcite . in the clg model lattice sites may be empty or occupied by one particle . in order to mimic a repulsive interaction a given particle",
    "is considered as active if at least one of its neighboring sites on the lattice is occupied by another particle .",
    "if all neighboring sites are empty the particle remains inactive .",
    "active particles are moved in the next update step to one of their empty nearest neighbor sites , selected at random .",
    "the second model is the so - called conserved threshold transfer process ( cttp )  @xcite , a modification of the threshold transfer process introduced in  @xcite . here",
    ", lattice sites may be empty , occupied by one particle , or occupied by two particles .",
    "empty and singly occupied sites are considered as inactive whereas double occupied lattice sites are considered as active . in the latter case one tries to transfer both particles of a given active site to randomly chosen empty or singly occupied nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the third model is a modified version of the manna sandpile model  @xcite the so - called fixed - energy manna model  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the cttp the manna model allows unlimited particle occupation of lattice sites .",
    "we use in our investigations the original manna relaxation rules , i.e. , lattice sites which are occupied by at least two particles are considered as active and all particles are moved to the neighboring sites selected at random .",
    ".,width=264 ]    the three models are sketched in fig.[fig : sketch_models_01 ] .",
    "we use in all cases periodic boundary conditions , i.e. , closed systems are considered and the number of particles is conserved . in our simulations",
    "( see  @xcite for details ) we start from a random distribution of particles .",
    "all models reach after a transient regime a steady state which is characterized by the average density of active sites  @xmath3 .",
    "the density  @xmath3 is the order parameter and the particle density  @xmath4 is the control parameter of the absorbing phase transition , i.e. , the order parameter vanishes at the critical density  @xmath5 according to @xmath6 , with the reduced control parameter @xmath7 .",
    "additionally to the order parameter we consider its fluctuations @xmath8 . approaching the transition point from above ( @xmath9 ) the fluctuations",
    "diverge according to @xmath10 ( see  @xcite ) . below the critical density ( in the absorbing state )",
    "the order parameter as well as its fluctuations are zero in the steady state .    similar to equilibrium phase transitions it is possible in the case of absorbing phase transitions to apply an external field  @xmath11 which is conjugated to the order parameter , i.e. , the field causes a spontaneous creation of active particles ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "a realization of the external field for absorbing phase transitions with a conserved field was developed in  @xcite where the external field triggers movements of inactive particles which may be activated in this way . at the critical density",
    "@xmath12 the order parameter and its fluctuations scale as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "it was shown recently that the order parameter and its fluctuations obey in the steady state the scaling forms  @xcite @xmath15 the universal scaling functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the same for all systems belonging to a given universality class whereas all non - universal system - dependent features ( e.g.  the lattice structure , the update scheme , etc . )",
    "are contained in the so - called non - universal metric factors @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20  @xcite . the universal scaling functions are normed by the conditions @xmath21 and the non - universal metric factors can be determined from the amplitudes of @xmath22 these equations are obtained by choosing in the scaling forms [ eqs.([eq : scal_ansatz_eqos ] , [ eq : scal_ansatz_fluc ] ) ] @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "an active site is triggered by the external field in a cluster of inactive sites .",
    "the arrows denote how the active particles ( full circles ) are moved in the next update step . due to",
    "the dynamic rules of the cttp only two different relaxation processes ( selected randomly ) occur : both particles are moved to the same empty site or both particles are moved to two adjacent sites .",
    "thus the dynamics of the one - dimensional cttp is characterized by a trivial random walk of the perturbation .",
    "this random walk proceeds until it reaches the boundary of a cluster .",
    ", width=264 ]    a recently performed analysis of the universal scaling functions as well as of the critical exponents for @xmath25  @xcite confirms the conjecture of  @xcite that the clg model , the cttp , and the manna model belong to the same universality class .",
    "the situation is more complicated in one - dimensional systems where a splitting of the universality class occur .",
    "the reason for the non - universal behavior is that the dimensional reduction changes the stochastic character of the dynamics ( see fig.[fig : sketch_models_01 ] . ) .",
    "for instance the clg model is characterized by deterministic toppling rules in @xmath26 and exhibits a trivial phase transition with @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( see also in  @xcite ) . due to the trivial behavior of the one - dimensional clg model we consider in this work the two- and three - dimensional clg model only .    in the case of the cttp we observe that roughly 4@xmath29 of the relaxation events are deterministic .",
    "furthermore a perturbation that is triggered by the external field performs a simple random walk ( see fig.[fig : sketch_cttp_01 ] ) .",
    "this pathologic behavior is completely different from the behavior of the one - dimensional manna model that is characterized by a pure stochastic relaxation of active particles to the next neighbors .",
    "more than the other models the manna model is therefore the paradigm of the universality class of absorbing phase transitions with a conserved field . in the following",
    "we will call that class the manna universality class since universality classes are often labeled by the simplest model belonging to them .",
    "the universality splitting of the one - dimensional systems is in full agreement with the universality hypothesis of sandpile models  @xcite . according to this conjecture the universality classes of sandpile models",
    "are determined by the way the particles are distributed to the next neighbors ( deterministic , stochastic , directed , undirected , etc . ) .",
    "obviously the manna universality class is characterized by a stochastic and undirected distribution of particles .",
    "similar to equilibrium critical phenomena we assume that the system size  @xmath30 enters the scaling forms [ eqs.([eq : scal_ansatz_eqos],[eq : scal_ansatz_fluc ] ) ] as an additional scaling field , i.e. @xmath31 where the exponent @xmath32 describes the divergence of the spatial correlation length , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "note that the universal scaling functions depend now on the particular choice of the boundary conditions , the system shape etc .",
    "@xcite . throughout this work we use in all dimensions hyper cubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "however , the universal scaling functions [ eqs.([eq : scal_ansatz_eqos],[eq : scal_ansatz_fluc ] ) ] are recovered in the thermodynamic limit , e.g. @xmath34    additionally to the order parameter and its fluctuations we consider the fourth - order cumulant  @xmath35 which is defined as ( see for instance  @xcite ) @xmath36 for non - vanishing order - parameter the cumulant tends to @xmath37 in the thermodynamic limit . in the case of a zero order parameter",
    "the cumulant vanishes if the order parameter is characterized by a gaussian distribution symmetrically distributed around zero .",
    "the latter case is observed in equilibrium systems , e.g.  the ising model for @xmath38 . in the case of absorbing phase transitions",
    "the order parameter is non - negative per definition .",
    "thus the order parameter is characterized by a non - trivial distribution close to criticality and the above scenario does not apply .",
    "nevertheless one expects that the cumulant obeys the scaling form @xmath39 notice that no metric factor @xmath40 is needed since the cumulant is already dimensionless .",
    "choosing @xmath41 we get for zero - field @xmath42 which is obviously universal .",
    "the universal value @xmath43 corresponds to an intersection point if one plots @xmath35 as a function of @xmath4 for various system sizes  @xmath30 .",
    "thus it is possible to determine the critical value  @xmath44 from the common intersection point .",
    "this cumulant intersection method is very useful and was applied in numerous works  ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .    as usually finite - size effects have to be taken into account if the correlation length is of the order of the system size .",
    "a feature of these finite - size effects is that a given system may pass within the simulations from one phase to the other .",
    "this behavior is caused by critical fluctuations , i.e. , approaching the transition point the order parameter vanishes whereas its fluctuations diverge .",
    "but in contrast to common second order phase transitions the situation is drastically different in the case of absorbing phase transitions .",
    "approaching the transition point the correlation length @xmath45 increases and as soon as @xmath45 is of the order of @xmath30 the system may pass to an absorbing state and is trapped forever . additionally to the absorbing phase ( @xmath46 for @xmath47 ) the steady state order parameter and its higher moments vanish ( @xmath48 ) even in a small vicinity above the critical point .",
    "thus in the case of absorbing phase transitions it is impossible to consider finite - size effects of steady state quantities around the critical point .    in order to bypass this problem",
    "it was suggested ( see for instance  @xcite ) to consider metastable ( ms ) or quasisteady state values of the order parameter and its higher moments @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : rho_a_t_ms ] for the order parameter of the two - dimensional cttp close to the transition point .",
    "after a short transient regime the system reaches a metastable state where it can spend a certain time until it finally enters an absorbing state . in the metastable phase the order parameter",
    "is expected to fluctuate around a well defined average value @xmath50 which is used for the finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "this method was applied in previous works ( e.g.  @xcite and the results sound mostly valid .        nevertheless this method can be questioned .",
    "first , there is no well defined average value of the order parameter in the metastable regime .",
    "this can be seen in the inset of fig.[fig : rho_a_t_ms ] where we scrutinize the data .",
    "no clear saturation of the order parameter can be observed .",
    "second the method is quite inefficient . in the case of the data presented in fig.[fig : rho_a_t_ms ] we used @xmath51 different initial configurations for @xmath52 to get a sufficiently averaged estimate of the order parameter .",
    "although roughly @xmath53 lattice updates ( @xmath54 ) were performed no clear saturation could be observed .",
    "thus reliable data for larger lattice sizes ( @xmath55 ) , which are required for an appropriate finite - size scaling analysis , can not be obtained within moderate computer times .",
    "third and finally no rigorous prove exists that the metastable order parameter moments @xmath49 scale in the same way as the corresponding steady state order parameter moments .",
    "in contrast to the consideration of metastable phases we choose a different method in order to study finite - size effects in the steady state . in our simulations",
    "we measure the order parameter at the critical density ( @xmath56 ) as a function of the conjugated field  @xmath11 for various system sizes . due to the external field the system",
    "can not be trapped forever in the absorbing phase .",
    "therefore steady state quantities are available for all densities . in fig.[fig : rho_a_field_02 ] we present the order parameter and its fluctuations for the two - dimensional cttp model .",
    "the finite - size effects , i.e. ,  the deviations from the behavior of the `` infinite '' system ( @xmath57 ) can be clearly seen .",
    "note that the data for @xmath52 are averaged over @xmath58 lattice updates and we obtain smooth curves of the order parameter , its fluctuations as well as of the cumulant .",
    "thus the numerical effort of this method is significantly smaller than the above discussed analysis of the metastable regime .     as a function of the external field for various system sizes",
    "the inset displays the corresponding order parameter fluctuations .",
