    "pattern formation is a remarkable phenomenon of nonlinear dynamics , which characterizes the physical behavior of complex systems  @xcite . among several realizations encountered in the quantum world ,",
    "one interesting example , on which we will focus in this work , is the formation of self - organized bragg gratings by particles scattering photons in a high - finesse optical resonator  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is due to the mechanical effects of atom  photon interactions and emerges from coherent light scattering by an atomic gas into a single mode of the electromagnetic field inside the cavity .",
    "the light scattered by a spatially homogeneous particle distribution can not significantly excite the cavity mode due to destructive interference of the electric fields stemming from different atoms since they have random phases . above a certain critical intensity of the transverse pump laser , however , the atomic density undergoes a transition to a periodic distribution for which the intracavity light field is maximized .",
    "vice versa , the field gives rise to a mechanical potential , which confines the atoms in the very same pattern . in a single - mode standing - wave cavity there",
    "exist two equivalent such configurations , each corresponding to an intracavity field of the same amplitude but of opposite phase .",
    "this behavior was first predicted in  @xcite and experimentally confirmed shortly afterwards  @xcite .",
    "several theoretical  @xcite and experimental studies  @xcite have analyzed various aspects of the self - organization phenomenon , including extensions to multimode resonators  @xcite .",
    "studies of dynamics of pattern formation in other systems have shown that these dynamics can be significantly modified in the presence of further pumping fields  @xcite , which can impose an auxiliary phase favoring a certain pattern . in this work",
    "we theoretically study the interplay between longitudinal and transverse laser pump fields in determining spatial ordering inside a single - mode standing - wave resonator .",
    "we consider a setup as in fig .",
    "[ fig_system ] and show that , when the two lasers driving the cavity and the atoms are resonant , the laser pumping the cavity can act as a seed for the dynamics of pattern formation .",
    "we identify the conditions on the longitudinal laser for which the phase of bragg gratings can be predetermined , and for which one can even dynamically force a bragg grating of atoms to jump into another pattern .     and illuminated by a transverse laser beam of strength @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath1 exceeds a certain threshold value the atoms self - organize in stable bragg gratings which maximize scattering into the cavity mode . here",

    "[ sec_model ] the theoretical model is introduced , from which semiclassical stochastic differential equations are derived .",
    "these equations are the basis of the numerical simulations presented in sec .  [ sec_seeding ] , where the dynamics of self - organization are studied in the presence of a laser pumping the cavity and as a function of its relative phase and amplitude .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ sec_conclusions ] the conclusions are drawn .",
    "we consider a cloud of @xmath3 cold atoms of mass @xmath4 whose motion is confined along the axis of a linear standing - wave cavity as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig_system ] .",
    "the atoms are directly illuminated by a transverse laser beam whose frequency @xmath5 is far detuned from any internal atomic transition , but close to a single cavity resonance such that the particles can scatter photons from the driving laser into this resonator mode .",
    "a second laser at the same frequency @xmath5 directly drives the resonator mode through one of the cavity mirrors . in this limit",
    "the external and cavity degrees of freedom undergo a coupled dynamics .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 and @xmath7 the canonically - conjugated position and momentum of the @xmath8th atom , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the bosonic annihilation and creation operators of a cavity photon .",
    "the coherent dynamics are then described by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath11-\\hbar{\\delta_\\mathrm{c}}a^\\dagger a\\\\   + \\sum_{j=1}^n\\hbar\\eta\\left(a+a^\\dagger\\right)\\sin(kx_j ) -i\\hbar\\left({\\eta_\\mathrm{p}}^*a-{\\eta_\\mathrm{p}}a^\\dagger\\right),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 denotes the cavity wave number .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 is the light shift per photon and @xmath14 is the effective cavity pump strength stemming from the light scattered from the transverse laser into the mode by the atom cloud .",
    "in addition , we also consider a longitudinal cavity pump of strength @xmath15 , including the possibility of a different phase with respect to the transverse laser .",
    "the hamiltonian is reported in the reference frame rotating at the transverse frequency @xmath5 , which is assumed to be resonant with the laser pumping the cavity .",
    "in particular , @xmath16 is the detuning between the pump lasers and the bare cavity resonance frequency .",
    "owing to the non - perfect mirrors photons leak out of the resonator .",

    "dissipation effects due to atomic spontaneous emission are here neglected under the assumption that the atomic transition is driven far - off resonance .",

    "the coupled system of atoms and cavity photons is known to exhibit self - organized patterns in the absence of any longitudinal laser ( @xmath27 ) when the transverse laser intensity exceeds a certain threshold value  @xcite .",
    "the intracavity field is maximized when the atoms order in one of two equivalent ( nonhomogeneous ) configurations .",
    "the phase of the former , however , depends on the specific pattern realized , i.e. , the particles either gather at lattice sites where @xmath28 or where @xmath29 ( denoted by `` even '' and `` odd '' sites , respectively ) .    it has been argued that the occurrence of self - organization is a symmetry - breaking process , where the symmetry between the two configurations is spontaneously broken by initial particle fluctuations and cavity input noise  @xcite .",
    "microscopically , one pattern is chosen for each trajectory , to which one can associate an order parameter , here identified with the quantity  @xcite @xmath30 below threshold , where the atoms are homogeneously distributed , @xmath31 , while in the perfectly self - organized phase the order parameter adopts values @xmath32  @xmath33 for even ( odd ) patterns . at this point",

    "the atoms elastically scatter photons into the cavity and the intracavity field is maximized when all atoms scatter in phase , which here corresponds to arrays with interparticle distance equal to the cavity mode wavelength @xmath47 .",
    "the intracavity light field gives rise to a potential which has minima at either the even or odd sites , which form from initial fluctuations with equal probability .",
    "if the cavity is directly pumped as well , the scenario drastically changes . in this case ,",
    "in fact , the cavity field is the coherent superposition of the scattered and of the directly injected field as seen in eq .  .",
    "clearly , the phase of the injected field plays a role by favoring one pattern over the other , depending on which one maximizes the depth of the intracavity potential .",

    "we see though in figs .",
    "[ fig_seed_hist](b ) and  [ fig_seed_theta](b ) that the second pattern is only strongly suppressed and not impossible ; there roughly 10% of the trajectories ended up in the `` wrong '' configuration .",
    "this specific number is an artifact of the relatively small ensemble considered , just like the fact that all trajectories ended up in an odd pattern for positive @xmath2 in figs .",
    "[ fig_seed_hist](c ) and  [ fig_seed_theta](c ) .",
    "these two cases thus already suggest a large statistical error of the seeding efficiency and the necessity of averaging over much larger ensembles .",

    "[ fig_probability ] for a large ensemble the probability that a certain configuration is dynamically realized approaches 100% for sufficiently large values of the cavity drive @xmath48 .    .",
    "the second pattern occurs with a small , but finite probability which decreases as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "this figure was obtained by integrating the sdes   for a short time ( @xmath55 ) and computing the ratio of the number of trajectories for which @xmath56 and the ensemble size .",

    "the other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig_selforg ] . ]",
    "pattern seeding by means of a longitudinal field can be understood in terms of interference between the electric fields scattered by the atoms and directly injected by the cavity pump .",

    "this result is valid for @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the thermal velocity .",

    "then , for a given sign of @xmath36i.e .",
    ", whether the atoms form an even or odd pattern  the sign of @xmath2 determines whether @xmath65 becomes larger and hence the potential deeper .",

    "figure  [ fig_phasediagram_long ] displays this quantity for @xmath72 as obtained by numerically integrating eqs .   for long times . for completeness",
    "we also report the analytical predictions of  @xcite valid at @xmath27 in the weak - coupling regime ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "indeed , whilst we observe the expected bifurcation at the self - consistent threshold without cavity drive , only one branch is selected when the latter is sufficiently strong .",
    "for larger ensembles , however , the behavior suggested by fig .",
    "[ fig_probability ] is expected to become visible , i.e. , a finite number of trajectories ending up in the opposite pattern . in particular ,",
    "finite probabilities of finding odd patterns are expected at larger values of @xmath0 . at the same time",
    "the sharp transition is smeared out to a smooth crossover  the value of @xmath36 increases monotonously to unity .",
    "this behavior becomes more enhanced as @xmath48 is increased by one order of magnitude .",
    "a special case is realized when the longitudinal pump is sufficiently strong to give rise to a deep intracavity lattice even in the absence of the transverse laser .",
    "this is found , for instance , when @xmath68 . in this regime , at @xmath49 the atoms are localized at the minima of the @xmath74 part of the cavity optical lattice   which is reflected by a high value of the bunching parameter @xmath70 , as visible in the inset of fig .  [ fig_phasediagram_long ] .",
    "a small value of @xmath0 then already gives rise to a finite probability of finding the atoms in the even pattern .",
    "we have checked that the observed steady - state value of @xmath36 is mainly due to the mechanical potential associated with the longitudinal laser . for @xmath52 ,",
    "on the other hand , collective photon scattering plays a crucial role in the formation of even patterns .",
    "we now analyze the formation of a seeded pattern ( e.g. , the even one ) considering two situations .",
    "first , when the atoms initial spatial distribution is uniform , and second when the initial distribution corresponds to the opposite pattern . figure  [ fig_phasediagram_dynamical ] shows the onset of a seeded pattern for an initially uniform distribution , i.e. , how the order parameter in fig .   is dynamically established .",
    "we observe that the time scale over which the pattern forms decreases as the amplitude of the seeding field is increased .",
    "this behavior is particularly pronounced below threshold .     for @xmath75 trajectories simulated using eqs .",
    "as a function of time for @xmath27 ( red ) , @xmath52 ( blue ) , and @xmath68 ( green ) . from top to bottom ( left to right )",
    "the value of @xmath0 is @xmath76 .",
    "the other parameters are the same as as in fig .",
    "[ fig_selforg ] . ]",
    "let us now assume that @xmath27 and that the atoms are pumped by a transverse laser with @xmath77 above the ( instantaneous ) threshold . after some time the system reaches a stationary configuration which can be , for instance , an even pattern .",
    "an intense longitudinal pump field is then switched on .",
    "if its amplitude @xmath2 is chosen to be real , the particles remain in the even pattern since according to eq .",
    "the number of intracavity photons  and hence the potential depth  increases . instead",
    ", when for instance the relative phase of the longitudinal pump differs from the transverse laser field by @xmath78 , then the scattered and the injected field can interfere .",
    "this situation can lead to a pattern flip in the case that the phase of the scattered field gives rise to destructive interference .",
    "we expect that the scattered field vanishes and thus the atoms reorganize in the pattern for which the two field contributions add up coherently .",
    "we thus choose the relative phase @xmath78 and @xmath48 about 40 times larger than the maximum scattering rate into the resonator by the atoms ( @xmath79 ) .     and",
    "@xmath40 . at @xmath80",
    "the longitudinal laser is switched on with @xmath81 in order to compensate for the scattered field for a short time .",
    "finally , at @xmath82 the external laser is reduced to @xmath50 .",
    "the other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig_selforg ] . ]",
    "figure  [ fig_flip ] shows the order parameter , mean number of intracavity photons , and the real and imaginary part of the intracavity field amplitude as a function of time for a single trajectory .",
    "when the strong longitudinal pump is switched on , one observes that the system readjusts in an odd pattern which augments the intracavity photon number .",
    "the order parameter , however , remains smaller than unity , representing a situation in which several defects , namely atoms trapped at even sites , are present .",
    "this can be understood through the sde   for the field and its approximate steady - state value  : the intracavity field is overcompensated by the external driving such that its real part becomes positive , i.e. , the odd sites become deeper than the even ones according to eq .  . due to the external pump",
    "the latter , however , remain sufficiently deep to confine a considerable fraction of the particles on the considered short time scale .",
    "afterwards , the longitudinal laser intensity is reduced to @xmath50 , for which the intracavity optical lattice is shallow , and the particles are now again trapped by their own scattered light , i.e. , after a transient time , in which the atoms first form a uniform distribution , the order parameter becomes again close to unity .",
    "its sign , however , is the opposite of the initial one prior to the pulse sequence .",
    "alternatively , one could also envisage a scheme , where the longitudinal pump power is continuously reduced after the flip .",
    "this behavior is exemplary for understanding how the system reacts to external perturbations .",
    "in this work we presented a model and a numerical study of the effect of a longitudinal pump on self - organization of cold atoms in an optical resonator . we have focused on the situation in which both the transverse laser , pumping the atoms , and the longitudinal laser , driving the cavity mode , are resonant .",
    "the system exhibits a stationary state which can be an ordered pattern even below the self - organization threshold , provided that the longitudinal pump is sufficiently strong .",
    "the phase of the pump is crucial in determining the pattern which self - organizes . the longitudinal field , hence , acts as a seed , breaking the symmetry between the even and odd patterns , which are otherwise equivalent .",
    "the relative phase between longitudinal and transverse pump is thus a control handle for determining the configuration in which the atoms self - organize , to the point that it can be used to force the atoms to flip patterns .",
    "our analysis has so far focused on resonant external fields , which allow one to reduce the dynamics to a time - independent problem by moving to the reference frame rotating at the laser frequency .",
    "the situation is going to be dramatically modified when the two lasers are detuned one from the other . in this case the equations of motion are explicitly time dependent and exhibit an intrinsic period determined by the frequency mismatch between the two lasers .",
    "chaotic behavior could here emerge at sufficiently low levels of noise .",
    "the authors acknowledge discussions with tobias donner and andrs vukics . w.n .",
