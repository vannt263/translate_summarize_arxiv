    "field - induced phase transition in the quantum spin systems has been providing interesting physics such as magnon bose einstein condensation@xcite .",
    "recently an exotic field induced phase transition was observed for baco@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite , which can be regarded as the quasi - one - dimensional(1d ) @xmath0 xxz antiferromagnt having the ising - like anisotropy @xmath3 ; the magnetization and electron spin resonance ( esr ) measurements above 1.8k show that baco@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 is basically described by the bethe - ansatz - based theoretical analysis.@xcite however , the specific heat measurements up to 12 t below 1.8k has revealed that the weak 3d couplings possibly trigger the exotic incommensurate(ic ) order in the low - field region.@xcite a peculiar point on this phase is that the ordering is different from the nel type at the zero magnetic field and the shape of the phase boundary in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane is quite different from the usual field induced order in the coupled haldane system@xcite .",
    "this suggests that the ising - like anisotropy in the quasi-1d system plays an essential role in the field induced ic order phase , behind which there is substantially important physics .",
    "the 1d xxz antiferromagnet is an exactly solved model playing the essential role to understand the critical quantum fluctuation and strong correlation effects.@xcite although the ising - like anisotropy favors the @xmath6 directed nel(@xmath6-nel ) order at the zero magnetization , the magnetic field beyond the critical field @xmath7 recovers the critical quantum fluctuation(see fig.[fig1 ] ) and then the system is described by the tomonaga - luttinger(tl ) liquid,@xcite which is characterized by the power law decay of the correlation functions : @xmath8 \\label{tvcf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the tl exponent , @xmath10 is the uniform magnetization due to a magnetic field @xmath4 , and the corresponding fermi wave number is @xmath11 .",
    "the nonuniversal coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 were evaluated in ref.@xcite . for the isotropic heisenberg model",
    ", @xmath14 is always satisfied and thus the transverse fluctuation of ( [ tvcf ] ) is dominant . for the ising - like case",
    ", however , @xmath15 appears in the low field region , where the longitudinal ic fluctuation becomes dominant . in the actual quasi-1d compound",
    ", there is indispensable inter - chain interaction , which may bring the finite temperature phase transition accompanying the field - dependent ic order .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the field induced ic order for the coupled xxz chains , using the bosonization combined with the mean - field treatment of the inter - chain interaction@xcite . in particular , we make quantitative analysis of the transition temperatures , taking account of the non - universal coefficients in ( [ lgcf ] ) and ( [ tvcf ] ) .",
    "we then find that the ic order is certainly realized in the low field region , in contrast with ref.@xcite where the possibility of the ic order was not taken into account , while the transverse staggered order appears in the high - field region .",
    "moreover , we show that the present theory successfully explains the field dependence of the experimentally observed transition temperature",
    ". we also determine the inter - chain coupling of the baco@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 as @xmath16k .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we explain the model and the mean - field theory for the inter - chain interaction on the basis of bosonization . in sec.iii , magnetic - field dependences of the transition temperatures are presented for the ic order and the transverse staggered order .",
    "then the ic order of baco@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 is discussed in detail . in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize conclusions and discuss related topics .",
    "the relevant model we consider here is the weakly coupled @xmath0 xxz chains on the simple cubic lattice , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the deformed inner product .",
    "the index @xmath19 runs along the chain direction , @xmath20 labels the inter - chain directions , and @xmath21 denotes the nearest neighbor pair of the chains .",
    "then @xmath22 is the exchange coupling along the chain direction and the inter - chain interaction is controlled by @xmath23 .",
    "note that we set the lattice space to be unity .",
    "let us discuss the order - disorder transition in @xmath24 .",
    "since the simple cubic lattice is considered , we can set up the `` sub - chain '' mean fields as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a classical vector field .",
    "we assume the ic oscillation of the magnetization of the @xmath6 component around the uniform(average ) magnetization , @xmath27 { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ e$}}_z , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the amplitude of the ic fluctuation around the average magnetization @xmath10 and the sign depends on the sub chain . also for the transverse staggered fluctuation , we assume @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the amplitude of the staggered magnetization in the transverse direction",
    ". then , the mean - field treatment of the inter - chain coupling yields the mean - field hamiltonian per chain as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the 1d xxz chain in an effective magnetic field @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the perturbation originating from the mean fields . for the ic order",
    ", we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "note that the coordination number is @xmath38 for 3d .",
    "these effective fields should be determined self - consistently .",
    "also for the transverse staggered fluctuation , we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41    in order to treat the ic nature in the mean - field hamiltonian , it is useful to employ the effective model in the continuum limit .",
    "this is achieved by the standard bosonization scheme.@xcite assuming @xmath42 or @xmath43 , we can write the xxz chain in the magnetic field as @xmath44 , \\label{tl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the spin wave velocity and the compactification radius @xmath46 is defined by the boundary condition @xmath47 .",
    "the equal time commutator of the bosonic fields is defined as @xmath48=i\\theta(x - y)$ ] , where @xmath49 is the step function . for the xxz model ,",
    "the radius varies @xmath50 as the magnetic field increasing from @xmath7 to the saturation(free fermion ) limit .",
    "the tl exponent is given by @xmath51 .",
    "the boson representation of the spin operators is given by the formula @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are nonuniversal coefficients depending on @xmath55 and @xmath4 .",
    "using ( [ bsz ] ) and ( [ bsp ] ) , the amplitude of the equal time correlation function is given by @xmath56 , @xmath57 with the regularization @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a cutoff parameter .",
    "although the analytical expression of these coefficients in the magnetic field are still unknown , the numerical value is available in ref.@xcite , which play a crucial role to semi - quantitative evaluation of the transition temperature , as will be seen later . substituting ( [ bsz ] ) and ( [ bsp ] ) into ( [ pszinc ] ) and ( [ psxst ] )",
    ", we obtain the boson field representation of the perturbations , @xmath60 where we have omitted the @xmath61 and @xmath62 oscillating terms .",
    "let us consider the effects of @xmath63 on the hamiltonian ( [ tl ] ) .",
    "the gap generated by the staggered field ( [ pstag ] ) was analyzed in ref.@xcite to be @xmath64 . also for the operator of @xmath65",
    ", the similar standard renormalization group argument leads @xmath66 . both of the operators are always relevant between @xmath7 and saturation field . in the lower field region , however , @xmath67 and thus @xmath68 ; the ic field is more relevant in the low field region , while the transverse staggered field is more relevant in the high field region .",
    "the border is just @xmath69 namely , an effective su(2 ) point . for the case of @xmath70",
    ", it corresponds to @xmath71 as in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "this analysis of the gap is consistent with the naive expectation of the critical exponent @xmath9 , which leads the ic order in the low field region . for the quantitative analysis ,",
    "however , the coefficients of the gaps become important .",
    "it should be also noted that the assumption @xmath72 is not valid in the vicinity of the lower critical field .",
    "now we proceed finite temperature behaviors . in the framework of the mean - field theory , @xmath73 or @xmath43",
    "should be determined self - consistently .",
    "write the ic magnetization of ( [ mfh ] ) at @xmath5 , @xmath33 and @xmath73 as @xmath74 , and the staggered magnetization at @xmath5 , @xmath33 and @xmath43 as @xmath75 .",
    "the self - consistent equations are written as @xmath76 and @xmath77 , combined respectively with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "taking @xmath80 limits , we can determine the transition temperatures @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 . according to the linear response theory ,",
    "the dynamical susceptibility can be represented through the correlation function : @xmath84\\rangle_t$ ] , where @xmath85 denotes the average at a temperature @xmath5 . for the tl hamiltonian ( [ tl ] ) , this dynamical susceptibility was actually calculated in ref.@xcite . for the estimation of the transition temperature ,",
    "the susceptibility at the soft mode is essential : for the ic order , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and for the staggered order , @xmath86 and @xmath88 . taking account of ( [ regularization ] ) ,",
    "the explicit form of the leading term becomes @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the euler s beta function .",
    "note that the cutoff parameter in ( [ chiic ] ) and ( [ chis ] ) formally corresponds to @xmath91 , due to the regularization ( [ regularization ] ) .",
    "the magnetic - field dependence is implicitly included in @xmath45 , @xmath9 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . substituting the above susceptibilities into ( [ mftc ] ) , we obtain the final result of the transition temperatures @xmath94 in the above expression , @xmath9 and @xmath45 can be exactly calculated by solving the bethe ansatz integral equation as in fig .",
    "in addition , the non universal amplitudes @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be obtained by using density matrix renormalization group and the bosonization expression of the correlation function for the open boundary system@xcite .",
    "we can thus calculate @xmath95 semi - quantitatively without any additional parameter . here",
    "it should be noted that the previous estimation for @xmath96 was based on the correlation amplitude at the zero magnetic field for @xmath97@xcite .",
    "on the basis of ( [ tcinc ] ) and ( [ tcstag ] ) , we calculate the magnetic field dependences of the transition temperatures of @xmath98 for various @xmath55 . the correlation amplitudes are extracted from the correlation functions obtained via density matrix renormalization group , as mentioned in the previous section . in figure 2 , we show the resulting phase diagrams in the @xmath99 plane , where the solid and broken lines respectively indicate ( [ tcinc ] ) and ( [ tcstag ] ) , and the magnetic field is normalized by the saturation field @xmath100 . the curve corresponding to the higher @xmath95 is realized as an actual order - disorder transition . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on the order - disorder transitions between the critical field @xmath7 and the saturation field @xmath100 .",
    "thus the @xmath6-nel phase of @xmath101 below @xmath7 is not shown here explicitly .",
    "in addition , note that @xmath7 for @xmath102 and 1.5 is in vicinity of @xmath103 in the scale of fig.[fig2 ] .    in fig.[fig2 ]",
    ", we can see that the ic order certainly occurs above the critical field @xmath7 . for @xmath102",
    ", the ic order appears in the vicinity of @xmath104 . as @xmath55 increases",
    ", the transverse staggered order is suppressed , while the ic order develops rapidly and the corresponding range of @xmath4 extends to the higher field region .",
    "an important feature of the ic order is that the field - dependence of @xmath105 illustrates a characteristic curve ; @xmath105 has the maximum near @xmath7 , and it decreases rapidly as @xmath4 increases .",
    "such shape of the phase boundary should be contrasted to the semicircle - like boundary for the field - induced staggered - order in the coupled haldane system .",
    "as further increasing @xmath4 , the curves for @xmath105 and @xmath96 intersect at a certain magnetic field , which is denoted as @xmath106 henceforth , and the transverse staggered order appears for @xmath107 .",
    "we can also see that , as @xmath55 becomes large , @xmath106 shifts to the higher field side .",
    "the behaviors above are basically consistent with the argument based on the tl exponents of the xxz chain , since the region of @xmath108 appears above the critical field @xmath7 and it extends rapidly to the higher field side , as @xmath55 is increased .",
    "however , it should be noted that @xmath106 does not coincide with the effective su(2 ) point @xmath69 .",
    "this is because @xmath69 is achieved in the effective field theory level and thus @xmath109 is permitted even at @xmath69 , in contrast to the isotropic heisenberg chain at the zero field having the su(2 ) symmetry in the spin operator level . since the correlation amplitude @xmath92 has a larger value than @xmath93(e.g .",
    "see fig . 2 in ref.@xcite ) , @xmath105 is relatively enhanced than @xmath96 , implying that @xmath106 slightly shifts to the higher field side than the effective su(2 ) point . in this sense ,",
    "the precise amplitudes are essential in the inter - chain mean - field theory .",
    "in addition , we can see that @xmath55 in ( [ tcinc ] ) is also a source of such an enhancement of the ic order .",
    "we next discuss the inter - chain - coupling dependence of transition temperatures . according to eqs .",
    "( [ tcinc ] ) and ( [ tcstag ] ) , the precise @xmath110-dependences are given by @xmath111 and @xmath112 , so that the scale of the transition temperature naturally becomes large , as @xmath110 is increased . in particular , we can see that @xmath105 is more easily lifted toward the higher field region where @xmath113 , since , as mentioned above , the ic order is basically enhanced by the correlation amplitude @xmath92 and the anisotropy @xmath55 .",
    "however , we should remark that such enhancement of @xmath105 in the inter - chain mean - field theory does not always lead to a clear observation of the ic order for a larger @xmath110 ; we need to pay special attention to stability of the ic order .",
    "let us recall that the spin flop transition occurs for the case of the spatially isotropic exchange coupling(@xmath114 ) , where the magnetization directly jumps from @xmath6-neel phase of @xmath101 to the transverse staggered ordered state .",
    "this suggests that the ic order becomes thermodynamically unstable beyond a certain critical @xmath110,@xcite so that it is embedded in the magnetization jump .",
    "unfortunately , the critical @xmath110 can not determined within the frame work of the mean - field theory for the inter - chain coupling , since analytical calculation of the free energy is still a difficult task . in the next subsection , nevertheless , we shall show that the stable ic order actually occurs in the experimental situation of baco@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "let us discuss the field dependence of the transition temperature of baco@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the basic parameters were determined by the magnetization and esr measurements@xcite .",
    "the exchange coupling in the chain direction is given by @xmath115k and the precise anisotropy parameter is @xmath116 .",
    "the critical field is @xmath117 t and the saturation field is about 23 t with @xmath118 .",
    "in addition , we have actually calculated the correlation amplitudes of @xmath119 . in figure[fig3 ] , the field dependence of the transition temperature for @xmath120k(@xmath121 ) is illustrated together with the experimental data , where the solid and broken lines indicate ( [ tcinc ] ) and ( [ tcstag ] ) respectively .    in the left side of @xmath7 corresponding to the solid triangles ,",
    "the @xmath6-nel order occurs , at which the uniform magnetization is zero .",
    "note that the transition temperature to the @xmath6-nel phase at @xmath103 is about 5.4k , which is much higher than @xmath105 . above @xmath7 , the @xmath6-nel order",
    "is destroyed by the magnetic field and then we come into the targeted region of the present theory .",
    "the solid circles indicate the experimental transition temperature up to 12 t .",
    "we can see that the theoretical curve ( [ tcinc ] ) excellently reproduces the experimental results , implying the inter - chain mean - field theory is basically correct for 3d .",
    "a remarkable point is that the shape of the experimental phase boundary is consistent with the theoretical curve of the ic order ; as @xmath4 increases above @xmath7 , @xmath105 decreases rapidly from @xmath122k down to @xmath123k .",
    "the above facts support that the ic order driven by the one dimensionality can be thermodynamically stabilized in the experimental situation .",
    "another interesting point is that , as further increasing @xmath4 , the theoretical curves for @xmath105 and @xmath96 intersects at @xmath124 t , which predicts that the transverse staggered order appears above @xmath125 t . in order to verify the theory ,",
    "a specific heat measurement in the higher field is is highly desirable .",
    "however , the value of @xmath96 is relatively low and thus the experimental observation in the competing region may be subtle .",
    "we have discussed the field induced ic order on the basis of the bosonization combined with the mean - field theory for the inter - chain interaction . in particular , the numerically exact correlation amplitudes plays the crucial role to explain the shape of the experimental phase boundary . in order to investigate the ic order beyond the mean - field level",
    ", we have also performed quantum montecarlo ( qmc ) simulations based on the directed loop algorithm .",
    "then , we have confirmed that the ic order actually occurs for a @xmath126@xcite .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the field - induced ic order is certainly realized in the actual system and the inter - chain mean - field treatment captures the essential nature of it .",
    "the inter - chain coupling of baco@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 estimated within the mean - field theory is @xmath120k .    from theoretical point of view",
    ", the phase transition for the 3d classical spin model with the easy - axis anisotropy was intensively studied in 70s , in the context of the spin flop transition.@xcite the low magnetized state is unstable in the 3d isotropic lattice system and the magnetization jumps directly from the @xmath6-nel state into the spin flopped state .",
    "the spin flop transition also occurs for the 2d ising - like xxz model on the isotropic square lattice at the zero temperature.@xcite the present result implies that , as the 1d fluctuation is enhanced , the ic order spin version of the charge density wave(cdw) emerges in the phase diagram .",
    "of course , baco@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 is insulating , and thus the mechanism is attributed to the nesting of `` spin '' itself . in this sense ,",
    "the present ic order is very similar to that in the spin - peierls system.@xcite however , the driving mechanism is the inter - chain spin - spin interaction itself rather than a spin - phonon coupling in the spin - peierls case . since the inter - chain interaction favors the transverse staggered order as well , the spin flop transition may be induced with a certain finite inter - chain coupling , implying that the thermodynamic stability of the ic order is a non - trivial question .",
    "the present result demonstrate that the ic order based on the 1d mechanism is certainly stabilized in the actual experimental situation .",
    "for the quasi-1d spin model , the fermi wave number @xmath127 can be easily controlled by the magnetic field , in contrast with the cdw in the metallic system .",
    "a further experimental study , particularly neutron scattering experiment in the magnetic field , is highly interesting .",
    "in addition , the connection to the spin flop transition in the high field region is also theoretically important problem , although the experiment for baco@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 suggests a weak first order transition at @xmath7 accompanying the spin - lattice coupling which may cooperatively stabilize the incommensurate order .",
    "finally we remark that our theory is valid not only for the similar quasi-1d systems with the easy axis anisotropy , but also for a class of the frustrating systems .",
    "in fact , the frustrating systems is often mapped into an effective xxz model , for which the ic order is actually pointed out.@xcite such enhancement of the ic fluctuation is also reported for an anisotropic @xmath128 chain@xcite .",
    "we hope that the rich physics associated with the spin anisotropy and quantum fluctuation can be developed by further theoretical and experimental researches .",
    "we would like to thank s. kimura , m. sato and n. kawashima for valuable discussion .",
    "we are also grateful t. hikihara for providing the numerical data in ref.@xcite .",
    "this work was partially supported by grants in aid for science researches from mext , japan .",
    "it was also supported by  high field spin science in 100 t \""
