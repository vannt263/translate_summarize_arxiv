    "the huge amount of polarization observations demanded the polarized radiative transfer .",
    "the main principles of gr polarized radiative transfer were formulated in @xcite . however , that formulation was not ready for applications as it lacked , for example , the faraday conversion and the suppression of faraday rotation in hot plasmas . the first application to the real object",
    "was done in @xcite .",
    "their calculations included faraday conversion , but made several approximations , some of which can be substantially improved upon .",
    "for example , their simple relation on @xmath0 and @xmath1 emissivities and faraday rotation and conversion constitutes an approximation that almost never holds .",
    "their emissivities are calculated in synchrotron regime , which breaks for temperatures about the electron mass .",
    "their frame of plasma does not fully account for the fluid motion .",
    "we are improving on their work in the present paper , in particular treating exactly the plasma response and extending it to non - thermal particle distributions .",
    "another important issue is the complexity of gr polarized radiative transfer .",
    "the errors and implicit strong approximations may slip into the equations of almost every author .",
    "this is more likely the case , when certain derivation is done half - way by one author and then continued by another author , e.g. the derivation of the faraday conversion coefficient in the mixture of thermal and non - thermal plasmas in @xcite and @xcite neglected the importance of the finite ratio of cyclotron to observed frequencies .",
    "another good example is the definition of the sign of circular polarization @xmath2 it varies from article to article and the consistent definition in a single derivation is essential .",

    "the offset is due to the enforcement of lorenz gauge ( [ gauge ] ) .",
    "it conveniently makes @xmath253 the vector @xmath7 is found by a simple vector product @xmath254 and then normalized . the spatial part ( @xmath255 @xmath256 @xmath257 ) of basis ( [ hat_basis ] ) relates to basis ( @xmath12 @xmath23 @xmath24 ) via the orthonormal transformation preserving angles .",

    "the described gr polarized radiative transfer finds its application in accretion onto low luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagns ) , in particular sgr a*. the application of gr is necessary to infer the bh spin , which provides important information on the past evolution of the bh and the host galaxy itself .",
    "for example , the accretion efficiency in the agn phase depends strongly on the value of bh spin @xcite . the value of spin and spin orientation constraints the accretion and merger history @xcite .",
    "the detailed application to sgr a * is reported in @xcite .",
    "let us describe on the example of that paper , how one connects to observations .",
    "first , one constructs a set of dynamical models , preferably based on 3d grmhd simulations .",
    "then the gr polarized radiative transfer is performed for those models as described in the present work .",
    "the simulated spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , linear ( lp ) and circular ( cp ) polarization fractions as functions of frequency @xmath261 are fitted to the observed quantities , representative for the quasi - quiescent state of accretion .",
    "the @xmath262 analysis is performed based on the inferred error or variability of the observed quantities .",
    "then the best fits in the parameter space can be found .",
    "the probability density can be integrated over the full parameter space to obtain the most likely values and the confidence intervals of bh spin , inclination angle , position angle , and model parameters .",
    "let us now describe the effects , which lead to certain observed cyclo - synchrotron spectra , lp and cp fractions , and the electric vector position angle ( evpa ) as functions of frequency .",
    "the effects are plenty , what proves it hard to disentangle and provide simple explanations of observations .",
    "it is in general challenging to achieve the realistic level of details in collisionless plasma modelling .",
    "the next step in @xcite might not be the most self - consistent .",
    "first , the radiation from llagns appears to be variable in time .",
    "the simultaneous short observations can provide only the single snapshot of a system , not necessarily representative of a long term behavior .",
    "thus , it is necessary to obtain the statistically significant sample of variability of both observed and simulated spectra to reliably estimate the average or typical flow parameters and bh spin . as recent research suggests @xcite , the modelling of a single flare can successfully be done even without invoking gr .    as in the case of sgr a * , the cyclo - synchrotron specific flux @xmath263 vs @xmath172 can have a peak .",
    "the peak frequency @xmath264 and flux @xmath265 do not necessarily correspond to the thermal cut - off of emission .",
    "even a small percentage of the non - thermal electrons can radiate significantly more than the bulk of thermal electrons .",
    "for the efficient particle acceleration most of emission may come from the energetic electrons with cooling time @xmath266 about the time of inflow @xmath267 from several bh gravitational radii @xmath268 the gravitational redshift and doppler shift due to relativistic motion can strongly modify the peak @xmath264 and @xmath269    the lp fraction can provide constraints on flow density near the emitting region owing to beam depolarization effect .",
    "the lp fraction is the highest at high frequencies , where only a small region of the flow shines and beam depolarization is weak .",
    "as all regions of the flow radiate at lower frequencies , differential faraday rotation and emission evpa vary , the resultant lp fraction is subject to cancelations and quickly ceases with @xmath270 however , cancelations at high @xmath172 may readily happen between two regions with similar fluxes and perpendicular evpas , those regions would have perpendicular magnetic fields .",
    "the same change of evpa with frequency can mimic the faraday rotation .",
    "the finite rotation measure ( rm ) @xmath271 does not necessarily happen due to faraday rotation @xmath272 .",
    "here @xmath273 is the wavelength .",
    "in fact , the meaningful application of formula ( [ rm_naive ] ) is limited to a toy case of cold plasma far from the emitting region with the homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "in reality , besides the change of emission evpa with @xmath274 the faraday rotation coefficient @xmath275 ( see eq.[ar_def ] ) is a function of frequency @xcite . the differential rotation measure",
    "@xmath276 is the measured quantity @xcite .",
    "it should be used in constraining the models . also , significant faraday rotation can happen in the emitting region , what introduces the effect of differential optical depth .",
    "thus , one can only fit the observed @xmath277 and use it along with other observables to constrain the system free parameters .",
    "as @xmath275 is a steeply declining function of temperature @xmath278 @xcite , the relativistic charges contribute little to this quantity .",
    "substantial levels of circular polarization were recently found in sgr a * ( @xcite , in prep . ) .",
    "there are several effects producing finite cp .",
    "first recognized was the emissivity @xmath279 in @xmath0 mode . according to @xcite",
    "it only is a factor of @xmath96 weaker than the total emissivity @xmath280 it produces the largest @xmath0 along the magnetic field .",
    "the faraday conversion , transformation between the linear polarization and the circular , operates perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the faraday conversion coefficient @xmath180 has a peculiar dependence on temperature of thermal plasma or particles @xmath96-factor @xcite : @xmath281 for cold plasma , @xmath180 is exponentially inhibited for very hot plasma and reaches the maximum for transrelativistic plasma with @xmath282 the exponential inhibition is an effect of finite ratio @xmath283 with peak @xmath180 only around @xmath284 for @xmath285 thus , for hot bulk part of particle distribution with @xmath286 the non - thermal electrons do not contribute significantly to faraday conversion .",
    "note that this result supersedes @xcite , who following @xcite neglected the importance of finite ratio @xmath287 similarly to linear polarization , the beam depolarization can lower the net value of circular polarization at low frequencies due to differential faraday conversion .",
    "in sum , there are often several explanations for the same observable quantity .",
    "one should not settle for a simplified model trying to reproduce the observations .",
    "instead , the rigorous ray tracing and aposteriori explanations of a fit to the observables would be the preferred reliable way .",
    "the proposed method has its limitation .",
    "the equation ( [ fin_trans ] ) is valid for optically thick medium , but it fails to describe the behavior of a set of photons for compton - thick medium .",
    "the encounters of photons with energetic electrons lead to significant changes in photon trajectory , whereas the previous discussion considered independent photons propagating along geodesics .",
    "luckily , the synchrotron absorption cross - section in sub - mm is much larger than the compton scattering cross - section , thus the optically thick medium near sgr a * is compton - thin and no modifications are needed for sgr a*. however , a careful consideration of compton scattering @xcite is needed to describe the sub - mm spectrum of compton - thick sources .",
    "in our endeavor to provide the complete and self - consistent description of gr polarized radiative transfer we conduct the full derivation starting from definitions and basic equations .",
    "the goal is to make the easy , transparent , and error - free derivations , thus mathematica 7 was used underway , the expressions were cross - checked .",
    "the absorptivities for thermal plasma were checked numerically against known synchrotron emissivities and cyclo - synchrotron approximations in @xcite .",
    "we stepped away from the standard textbooks and assumed `` the opposite '' observers definition of circular polarization @xmath44 carrying the definition through all other calculations .",
    "we chose the coordinate system with coplanar @xmath183 @xmath22 @xmath19 and derived the plasma response tensor @xmath288 in ( @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath9 ) basis , also projecting it onto the transverse coordinates @xmath12 @xmath40 repeating for completeness @xcite , we tie the polarized radiative transfer equation in the latter coordinates ( [ transfer ] ) with the transfer in @xmath289 @xmath7 coordinates with the help of matrix ( [ rmatrix ] ) . the generalization of radiative transfer to gr is performed in the easiest way owing to the invariance of occupation numbers in different photon states and the invariance of the transformation between the states .",

    "is discouraged in favor of full calculation .",
    "the provided interface of dynamical models and observations is waiting for its applications .",
    "the treatment of particles distributions is still limited . in the current state",
    "the calculations are optimized for isotropic in pitch - angle distributions and become especially simple for thermal particle distribution .",
    "the integration over the pitch - angle in formula ( [ resp_def ] ) is in general impossible to perform for non - isotropic distributions . in this case , the integral over @xmath171 should be done first analytically .",
