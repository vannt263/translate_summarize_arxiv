    "the theory of zonal spherical functions for semisimple groups of @xmath0adic type was completed by the early 1970 s through the work of satake @xcite and macdonald @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . unlike the case of real semisimple groups , an explicit formula for the values of the zonal spherical functions for the groups of @xmath0adic type",
    "was obtained and the plancherel measure on the set of positive definite spherical functions ( or , equivalently , on the set of irreducible unitary spherical representations ) was computed .",
    "later on , partially inspired by this formula , macdonald constructed a remarkable family of orthogonal polynomials @xmath1 associated to any finite , irreducible root system @xmath2 .",
    "these polynomials are weyl groups invariant functions which depend rationally on two sets of parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 and are indexed by the anti ",
    "dominant elements of the weight lattice of @xmath2 .",
    "their limit @xmath5 , as @xmath3 approaches infinity , coincides up to a scalar factor with the previously obtained formula for the spherical functions associated to a group of @xmath0adic type carefully chosen to match ( in a very precise sense ) the root system @xmath2 .    in a further development , opdam ( in the so  called differential setting ) , macdonald ( in the difference @xmath6setting ) ,",
    "cherednik ( general case ) and sahi ( for nonreduced root systems ) introduced another remarkable family of orthogonal polynomials @xmath7 also associated to finite root systems but indexed now by the full weight lattice .",
    "in contrast with @xmath1 , the polynomials @xmath7 are nonsymmetric ( i.e. not invariant under the action of the weyl group ) .",
    "the nonsymmetric macdonald polynomials became increasingly important from various points of view .",
    "on one hand , they enjoy many of the properties of the symmetric macdonald polynomials .",
    "for example they satisfy versions of macdonald s norm and evaluation  duality conjectures and they provide simplifications in the proofs of the original conjectures ( see , for example , @xcite ) . on the other hand , they were the key ingredient in many recent developments in the theory of orthogonal polynomials and related combinatorics ( for example , in the proof of macdonald s positivity conjecture for jack polynomials by knop and sahi ) , and for the harmonic analysis and representation theory of double affine hecke algebras ( through the work of cherednik ) .    despite the growing importance of nonsymmetric macdonald polynomials",
    "not much it is known with respect to their interpretation in classical representation  theoretical terms .",
    "the main difficulty in integrating them within the classical framework lies , on one hand , on our lack of explicit formulas for nonsymmetric macdonald polynomials and , on the other hand , on the fact that most special functions ( weyl characters , spherical functions , conformal blocks ) appearing in representation  theory are weyl group invariant .",
    "however , a first result in this direction was obtained in @xcite were it was shown that in the limit @xmath8 , as @xmath4 approaches infinity , the nonsymmetric macdonald polynomials coincide with demazure characters for basic representations of affine kac ",
    "moody groups , and in the limit @xmath9 , as both @xmath3 and @xmath4 approach infinity , the nonsymmetric macdonald polynomials coincide with demazure characters for irreducible representations of compact lie groups .",

    ", their symmetric counterparts @xmath5 describe the values of spherical functions on groups @xmath11 over @xmath0adic fields , with respect to @xmath12 , a special maximal compact subgroup of @xmath11 . keeping in mind that the zonal spherical functions are in fact matrix coefficients ( corresponding to pairs of @xmath12fixed vectors ) for irreducible spherical representations , our main results , theorem [ thm2 ] and theorem [ thm1 ] , attach a similar meaning to the polynomials @xmath10 :",
    "they give the values of matrix coefficients for unramified principal series representations of @xmath11 .",
    "the two vectors involved in the computation of each matrix coefficient are : one , a ( essentially unique ) @xmath12fixed vector , and the other , a carefully chosen iwahori fixed vector ( see section [ coeff ] for details ) .",
    "in contrast with the corresponding result for symmetric macdonald polynomials where the identification was established by comparing the explicit formulas on both sides , in our case , the result is made possible by the recursion formula for nonsymmetric macdonald polynomials obtained in @xcite . with the exception of sections 1 and 3 which form a brief exposition of the results from the theory of macdonald polynomials which will be used later on ,",
    "the rest of the paper is concerned with establishing the framework within the theory of groups over @xmath0adic fields which will make possible the identification between nonsymmetric macdonald polynomials and certain matrix coefficients .",

    "tits theory .",
    "sections 4 and 5 , which contain the main technical results , are inspired by the ( unpublished ) work of bernstein on projective generators for blocks ( in our case unramified principal series representations ) of the category of smooth representations of @xmath13adic groups .",
    "the idea of realizing the iwahori ",
    "hecke algebras as endomorphism algebras of such a projective generator appeared initially ( for split groups ) in @xcite . since we work here with non necessarily split groups and we need a slightly different variant of their result we choose to rework here some of the arguments .",
