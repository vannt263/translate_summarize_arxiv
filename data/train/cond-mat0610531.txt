    "in the present letter , we consider a quasi - one - dimensional electron gas with the rashba or dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction  @xcite .",
    "we argue that the system is magnetized when a voltage bias is applied longitudinally ( fig .",
    "[ fig_system ] ) with the chemical potential tuned to be in the energy gap generated by the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the magnetization indicates spin - carrying currents due to the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the origin of the magnetization , however , is entirely novel ; it is essentially different from the origin of the  spin accumulation \"  @xcite in two - dimensional systems with spin - orbit interactions .",
    "a spin - orbit interaction affects the dispersion of a conducting channel of a pseudo - one - dimensional system in two ways ( fig .",
    "[ fig_channel ] ) : first , the dispersion of up - spin electrons and that of down - spin electrons , respectively , shift sideways in the opposite directions ; next , the crossing of the dispersions at @xmath0 opens up an energy gap ( see , however , the discussions in  4 ) .     of the left contact , while the left - going current has a chemical potential @xmath1 of the right contact . ]    under this dispersion , we consider a simple theoretical state called the non - equilibrium steady state  @xcite ; the right - going current has the fermi distribution of the left contact while the left - going current has the fermi distribution of the right contact and they run ballistically and independently without reflection . when the chemical potentials ( the fermi levels ) of the right and left contacts are tuned to be in the energy gap of the dispersion ( the case ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig_channel ] ) , the number of up - spin electrons in the left - going current and the number of down - spin electrons in the right - going current can differ , and thereby appears the magnetization .",
    "this argument does not apply when the chemical potential is in the middle of a subband ( the case ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig_channel ] ) , where the right - going up - spin electrons cancel the magnetization of the right - going down - spin electrons .",
    "magnetic properties of mesoscopic systems with spin - orbit interactions are of great interest recently , particularly from the viewpoint of spintronics  @xcite ; we could control the dynamics of spins with an external electric field .",
    "most studies so far have focused on two - dimensional systems .",
    "the spin accumulation  @xcite and the spin - hall effect  @xcite are two of the phenomena much discussed in two dimensions .",
    "the recent study by eto _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed the occurrence of a spin - polarized current in a pseudo - one - dimensional system with the rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this let us realize that pseudo - one - dimensional systems also contain much interesting physics of spin - orbit interactions .",
    "we may say that the origin of exotic phenomena due to spin - orbit interactions in pseudo - one - dimensional systems is essentially different from the one in two - dimensional systems . both the spin - polarized current predicted by eto _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and the magnetization predicted here are due to an avoided crossing in the dispersion of the pseudo - one - dimensional system .",
    "we also note that we can treat pseudo - one - dimensional systems much simpler than two - dimensional systems .",
    "in fact , the linear response of the spin hall effect  @xcite is recently under debate ; it was shown  @xcite that the spin hall coefficient vanishes in the dc limit @xmath2 of the electric field under the presence of impurity scattering .",
    "it was then argued recently  @xcite that the long - range impurities may not eliminate the spin hall coefficient even in the dc limit .",
    "in contrast , the treatment of the electronic transport in one dimension is well established .",
    "our argument here is based on a common method widely used in studies of electronic transport in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "we have already confirmed that inclusion of elastic impurities does not alter our conclusion qualitatively  @xcite .",
    "let us begin our explanation with the rashba system .",
    "the treatment of the dresselhaus system is not much different .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system with the rashba spin - orbit interaction is given by  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the effective mass of an electron and @xmath5 denotes the strength of the rashba interaction . from a simplistic point of view",
    ", we could say that the term @xmath6 generates the gap at @xmath0 while the term @xmath7 helps the current in the @xmath8 direction to induce the magnetization in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "we choose the @xmath9 direction as the quantization axis of the electron spin . and hence use the following representations hereafter : @xmath10 we assume that the system has only one mode in the @xmath11 direction .",
    "the system is of length @xmath12 in the @xmath8 direction and of width @xmath13 in the @xmath9 direction with @xmath14 .",
    "hence the electrons run along the wire ballistically through a few channels .",
    "we first diagonalize the hamiltonian  ( [ eq10 ] ) in the momentum space with the bases @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "( for simplicity , we here imposed periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath9 direction , which might be indeed materialized as a nanotube  @xcite .",
    "see the discussions in  4 below for fixed boundary conditions . )",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ eq10 ] ) is given by a two - by - two matrix in the spin space in the form @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the spin rotation @xmath22 gives the representation @xmath23 with the eigenvalues  @xcite @xmath24 where the positive sign denotes the upper subband and the negative sign denotes the lower subband . for the lowest channel @xmath25",
    ", the dispersion has two branches of parabolas with up and down spins , respectively . in the higher channels @xmath26 , the two branches are mixed around the avoided crossing at @xmath0 ( fig .  [",
    "fig_disp](a ) ) .    ) for ( a ) some of the lowest channels and for ( b ) higher channels .",
    "the lowest channel has a real crossing at @xmath0 , but a higher channel has an avoided crossing . in ( b ) , the double minima of the lower branch vanish for a high channel and the whole dispersion shifts upwards as we go to even higher channels . ]",
    "note that , away from the avoided crossing , the lower branch in the region @xmath27 still predominantly has down spins while it almost has up spins in the region @xmath28 .",
    "incidentally , lower channels are nearly degenerate in the present system as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_disp](a ) .",
    "this near degeneracy may be lifted by a confining potential @xmath29 . as another remark , the double minima of the lower branch shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_disp](a ) vanish in higher channels and the dispersion shifts upwards in even higher channels ( fig .",
    "[ fig_disp](b ) ) .",
    "the algebra hereafter slightly changes in the latter case but the final result  ( [ eq180 ] ) below is still valid .",
    "the right - going current originated in the left contact with the chemical potential @xmath30 contains all the states with positive group velocities .",
    "the group velocity in the @xmath8 direction is @xmath31 which is positive wherever the slope of the dispersion is positive ( the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig_channel ] ) .",
    "each state @xmath32 has the magnetization per unit area in the @xmath9 direction of the form @xmath33 because the spin rotation @xmath34 changes the spin operator @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "thus we have the magnetization per unit area of the right - going current as @xmath37 @xmath38 for a channel , where @xmath39 denotes the fermi distribution with the temperature @xmath40 and the chemical potential @xmath41 and we defined for each channel the following variables : @xmath42 see fig .",
    "[ fig_channel ] . in changing the integration variable from @xmath43 to @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq170 ] ) , we used the density of states @xmath45 given by @xmath46 the van hove singularity is canceled in eq .",
    "( [ eq170 ] ) by the zero of @xmath47 .",
    "we can likewise obtain the magnetization @xmath48 of the left - going current .",
    "the total magnetization per unit area is given by @xmath49 note that only the integration over the energy gap survives .",
    "this is consistent with what we described in fig .",
    "[ fig_channel ] .",
    "let us analyze the linear response .",
    "we define the chemical - potential bias as @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq180 ] ) with respect to @xmath52 is followed by @xmath53 where @xmath54 with @xmath55^{2 } } \\quad \\mbox{and } \\quad x_{\\pm 0}(k_y)\\equiv \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\pm 0}(k_y)-\\mu}{k_\\mathrm{b}t}.\\ ] ]",
    "figure  [ fig_m_v ] shows the result of numerical calculation , where we used the values for an ingaas / inalas heterojunction  @xcite : @xmath56[ev m ] and @xmath57 .",
    "we also set @xmath58[@xmath41 m ] .    .",

    "the bars indicate the energy gaps of the channels . in higher channels ,",

    "we find in fig .",
    "[ fig_m_v](a ) a peak of the magnetization around the energy gaps of the dispersion relation .",
    "we observe for @xmath62[mv ] the magnetization of the order of @xmath63[j / t / m@xmath64 , which translates to @xmath65[g ] if we assume that the thickness of the heterojunction is @xmath66[nm ]  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_m_v](b ) shows the contribution of each channel , @xmath59 , to the total magnetization @xmath67 at @xmath60[k ] .",
    "we note that each contribution is finite over the range of the energy gap of the respective channel , which is indicated by each bar . in the present case , some of the energy gaps overlap and hence a sharp peak in fig .",
    "[ fig_m_v](a ) . figure  [ fig_m_v](b ) also tells us that the ripples in the tail of the curve for @xmath60[k ] in fig .",
    "[ fig_m_v](a ) is due to the summation over the channels .",
    "going back to eq .",
    "( [ eq180 ] ) , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_m_deltamu ] the dependence of the magnetization on the voltage bias @xmath68 beyond the linear response .     for @xmath69[mev ] . ]    the magnetization grows monotonically in this regime .",
    "although the contribution from a channel saturates as the voltage bias exceeds the energy gap of the channel , more and more channels contribute to the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq180 ] ) and hence the monotonic increase .",
    "so far , we have assumed periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "when we introduce a confining potential @xmath29 into the hamiltonian  ( [ eq10 ] ) , the gap at @xmath0 may be closed ; the standing wave in the @xmath9 direction includes both positive and negative @xmath70 and thus the gap - opening effect of the term @xmath6 is cancelled out .",
    "we can then revive the gap by introducing a magnetic field in the @xmath8 direction : @xmath71 . in order to confirm our prediction in the confined geometry",
    ", we carried out a numerical calculation of the corresponding tight - binding model on a two - leg ladder  @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the lattice constant .",
    "figure  [ fig_scandisp ] shows a result for @xmath74 , confirming our prediction .",
    "direction of the model  ( [ eq410 ] ) for @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "there are two subbands in this region , just as in fig .",
    "[ fig_channel ] .",
    "the broken curves in the negative side indicates the contribution of the right - going states with @xmath78 in the lower subband ( the second integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq170 ] ) ) , the broken curve in the positive side indicates the contribution of the left - going states with @xmath78 in the lower subband ( the first integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq170 ] ) ) , and the dotted curve indicates the contribution of the left - going states in the upper subband ( the third integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq170 ] ) ) .",
    "the solid curve is the sum of the three contributions , which survives only in the energy gap . ]",
    "note here that the width of the energy gap is of the order of @xmath79 but the magnitude of the magnetization is of the order of @xmath80 .",
    "details of the calculations on the lattice system will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath79 applied in the present section in order to revive the energy gap at @xmath0 may induce additional spin polarization at the left and right ends of the system , namely at the contacts to the baths . even without the magnetic field ,",
    "the dissipation at the contacts might generate some form of spin polarization .",
    "the precise magnitude of the polarization would strongly depend on the interaction between the system and the baths and is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the magnitude , however , should be of the order of @xmath81 compared to the magnetization @xmath67 ; the magnetization given in eq .",
    "( [ eq180 ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig_scandisp ] is the one per unit area , that is , a bulk quantity .",
    "we hence assume here that the spin polarization localized around the contacts is negligible .",
    "finally , the hamiltonian with the dresselhaus interaction takes the form  @xcite @xmath82 the rest of the formulation is the same as above with @xmath83 and with the spin quantization in the @xmath8 direction as in @xmath84 the magnetization in the @xmath8 direction is measured but the expression is the same as eq .",
    "( [ eq180 ] ) .",
    "to summarize , we predicted that the magnetization appears under a voltage bias in pseudo - one - dimensional systems when the fermi levels are tuned to be in the energy gap due to spin - orbit interactions .",
    "the magnetization is an indication of the spin - carrying current , but its origin is essentially different from the one in two - dimensional systems with spin - orbit interactions .",
    "the energy gap due to spin - orbit interactions plays a key role in exotic phenomena of pseudo - one - dimensional systems . without taking account of scattering processes , the argument may be naive ; we nevertheless believe that it is worth reporting and should be checked experimentally .",
    "we can also argue that the magnetization appears under a temperature gradient  @xcite rather than a voltage gradient ; this effect will be reported elsewhere .",
