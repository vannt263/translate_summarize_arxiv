    "detection of quantum effects in mesoscopic harmonic oscillator ( mho ) has been into the focus of study for quite a long time .",
    "such an oscillator is composed of a few billion atoms and therefore can be considered as a system of classical nature .",
    "interestingly , at low temperature , it can be driven into a quantum state , e.g. , a superposition of separated position eigenfunctions .",
    "enormous attempts have been taken to reach the quantum regime in the mho .",
    "a central thrust of this effort has been the development of ultra - sensitive displacement measurement techniques .",
    "the measurement of position of an oscillator of mass @xmath1 in quantum regime is however limited by the standard quantum limit ( sql ; @xmath2 ) , arising due to the intrinsic zero - point fluctuation , where @xmath3 is the natural frequency of the oscillator .",
    "in addition , the oscillator also gets perturbed by the measurement device itself in quantum regime , leading to the back - action of the oscillator onto the measurement device .",
    "this increases the minimum limit of achievable uncertainty of the position to @xmath4 . till date ,",
    "the best possible uncertainty that could have been achieved is @xmath5 @xcite in a nanomechanical oscillator ( @xmath6 ghz ) , coupled to a single - electron transistor , while uncertainties @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite are also reported in lower - frequency oscillators .",
    "back - action evading techniques with ideally infinite measurement precision have been proposed @xcite and demonstrated @xcite to achieve up to @xmath9 ; however it yields less information and requires the measurement to be much faster than the relaxation time of the oscillator .",
    "measurement of position below sql has seen a growing interest in recent times in the context of cavity optomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "generating non - classical states like position - squeezed states in this system can lead to @xmath10 .",
    "such a system consists of a single mode febry - perot cavity with one movable end mirror , in which the coupling between the cavity mode and the mechanical mode of the mirror is created due to the radiation pressure force .",
    "it has been considered as a test platform to explore possibilities of squeezing in mesoscopic oscillators .",
    "the radiation pressure force makes the coupling between the two modes , linear in @xmath11 , the displacement of the mirror from its equilibrium position .",
    "several proposals have been made to achieve position squeezing in such systems .",
    "for example , the position squeezing can be obtained by pumping the cavity by a squeezed light source and thereafter transferring this squeezing to the oscillator mode through a state transfer protocol @xcite .",
    "a two - mode cavity can be made equivalent to an engineered reservoir that can lead to squeezing of the oscillator via feedback @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that short pulses can be used to obtain mechanical squeezing in optical microcavity @xcite .",
    "such methods however require either a continuous source of squeezed light and high transfer efficiency at quantum level or short pulses and thereby are not the most sought - after methods for squeezing .",
    "a natural way of obtaining quadrature squeezing dynamically is to use a hamiltonian that is quadratic in position quadrature @xmath12 or momentum quadrature @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the annihilation operator of the quantized oscillator .",
    "e.g. , the hamiltonian @xmath15 , @xmath16 being equivalent to the squeezing parameter , that is similar to that of a degenerate parametric amplifier @xcite .",
    "position squeezing in ground state of the oscillator in presence of back - action would refer to @xmath17 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if a mechanical oscillator is suspended inside a cavity ( with both the mirrors fixed ) at a position where frequency @xmath18 of the cavity sees a node or anti - node ( i.e. , @xmath19 , a  membrane - in - the - middle \" set up ) , the coupling becomes quadratic in the displacement of the oscillator .",
    "in such a system , squeezing can be obtained through a unitary evolution . driving the cavity with two laser beams ,",
    "whose frequencies are detuned to either side the cavity resonance by an amount equal to the mechanical frequency in such a set - up , one can also obtain @xcite a quadratic hamiltonian .",
    "the squeezing property of a quadratic hamiltonian is discussed in details in @xcite in the context of cavity optomechanical systems .",
    "it is shown that to obtain a large squeezing , one requires a large number of average thermal photons and a proper conditional measurement of photon numbers in the cavity .",
    "this is however limited by the cavity decay , as large number of photons are prone to faster decay out of the cavity and it can lead to degradation of squeezing . to combat this dissipation ,",
    "alternative methods have also been proposed , that require applying three coherent fields @xcite or periodic intense pulses @xcite , as commonly used in dynamical decoupling techniques @xcite .    in all the above methods to obtain squeezing , one employs either a passive method such as feedback , or a set of coherent fields or pulses .",
    "further , though one can dynamically achieve squeezing through a quadratic hamiltonian , the squeezing effect is not pronounced , because , the optical cavity decays much faster than the oscillator . in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme to obtain dynamical squeezing , in which the effect of cavity decay is eliminated .",
    "this would be possible , if the cavity mode interacts dispersively with the system , while squeezing in the oscillator is governed by another auxiliary system , say , an atom .",
    "specifically , we consider an atom - cavity - oscillator hybrid system , in which a coherently driven atom is coupled to the mechanical oscillator via their common coupling to the cavity mode in the membrane - in - the - middle set up . the cavity mode is adiabatically eliminated from the interaction and thus the cavity decay can be avoided .",
    "further , we choose the low - lying energy levels of the atom , which are immune to spontaneous emission . in this way",
    ", the steady state squeezing becomes independent of any mode of decay in the system .",
    "the interesting features of this model are : ( a ) the control fields , that drive the atomic transition and the cavity mode , control the degree of squeezing in the position quadrature of the oscillator .",
    "( b ) the squeezing parameter depends upon the initial state of the atom .",
    "note that cavity optomechanics mediated by a two - level system has also been proposed in @xcite , in which a josephson - junction qubit strongly interacts directly with both a microwave cavity and the micromechanical oscillator . on the contrary , in the present model , the cavity mode , instead of the atom , mediates the coupling between the atom and the oscillator and the intrinsic atom - cavity and oscillator - cavity couplings are weak in nature , that further can be controlled by external pumping fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our hybrid system in sec .",
    "[ s : ii ] .",
    "we discuss how the effective atom - oscillator hamiltonian can be obtained via adiabatic elimination of the cavity mode .",
    "we also derive the expression of the squeezing in time - domain as well as in frequency domain .",
    "we discuss the effect of the thermal bath on squeezing .",
    "results are discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ s : iii ] , along with comparison with other proposals on squeezing .",

    "we consider a mechanical oscillator suspended inside an optical cavity , that has both the mirrors fixed ( the  membrane - in - the - middle \" setup ) @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of this system is governed by the following hamiltonian ( in @xmath21 unit ) : @xmath22 where @xmath23 here @xmath18 and @xmath3 are the frequencies of the cavity mode @xmath24 and the mechanical oscillator mode @xmath14 , respectively , @xmath25 defines the coupling between them , and @xmath26 is the amplitude of the coherent field of frequency @xmath27 that pumps the cavity mode . note that the @xmath25 is proportional to the second - order derivative of @xmath18 with respect to the displacement @xmath11 of the oscillator from its equilibrium position .",
    "this hamiltonian is quadratic , as @xmath28 is proportional to the second order of the operators @xmath14 and @xmath29 of the oscillator .    in our hybrid model",
    ", we consider a single atom with three relevant energy levels @xmath30 in @xmath0-configuration , that is magneto - optically trapped inside the cavity on either side of the oscillator [ see fig",
    "the @xmath31 transition is driven by a classical control field with frequency @xmath32 and the rabi frequency @xmath33 , while the cavity mode drives the @xmath34 transition .",
    "the relevant hamiltonian of the atom - cavity system can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the atom - cavity coupling constant and @xmath37 is the unperturbed hamiltonian of the atom . in the reference frame , rotating with the pumping laser frequency @xmath27 , the total hamiltonian @xmath38 of the hybrid system reduces to @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the cavity pump detuning .",
    "next , in the interaction picture with respect to the hamiltonian @xmath37 , the hamiltonian @xmath42 takes the following form : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the common detuning of the laser field and the cavity mode from the respective one - photon transition .",
    "we consider the large detuning limit @xmath46 . with this approximation",
    ", the excited state @xmath47 can be eliminated adiabatically @xcite and the three - level atom reduces to an effective two - level atom , with the relevant energy - levels @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the hamiltonian then can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 the first term in ( [ hac ] ) above represents the stark shifts of the ground states of the atom due to its coupling to the control field and the cavity field , while the second term describes the dispersive coupling between the atom and the cavity mode .",
    "the heisenberg equation of motion of the cavity mode @xmath24 can be written as @xmath52= -i\\left[\\delta a+\\epsilon -\\frac{\\omega g_1}{\\delta}|1\\rangle\\langle 1|a\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ -\\left.\\frac{\\omega g_1}{\\delta}|1\\rangle\\langle 0|+g_2(b+b^\\dag)^2a\\right]\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit , @xmath53 , we can adiabatically eliminate the cavity mode @xmath24 by choosing @xmath54 .",
    "this leads us to the following operator identity : @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the final effective hamiltonian becomes @xmath56 where @xmath57\\;.\\\\ \\label{g}\\ ] ] clearly , ( [ finalh ] ) depends quadratically on the position quadrature ( proportional to @xmath58 ) of the oscillator .",
    "this is the desired form of the hamiltonian to obtain squeezing through a unitary evolution .",
    "this is also equivalent to the hamiltonian that gives rise to quantum optical spring effect @xcite , in which decay of the atom or the cavity mode is now effectively eliminated .",
    "further , @xmath59 defines an atomic operator , indicating that by suitably choosing the initial state of the atom , one can control the squeezing parameter .",
    "this can be further revealed by rewriting @xmath59 in the eigenbasis of its atomic part as @xmath60\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 are the corresponding eigenstates .",
    "if the atom is prepared in one of these eigenstates @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) , the effective coupling constant takes the form @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "therefore one can obtain desired squeezing by a suitable choice of @xmath33 and @xmath26 .",
    "note that one could also achieve squeezing if the oscillator is parametrically driven so that the coupling constant becomes a sinusoidal function of time .",
    "this is usually done in a movable - mirror set - up , in which the frequency of the cavity pump laser is suitably modulated @xcite , while in the present hybrid model , one does not require any modulation .",
    "we assume that the oscillator is in thermal equilibrium with the phononic environment at a temperature @xmath66 .",
    "the state of the oscillator is described by the density matrix @xmath67 , where @xmath68)\\exp(-n\\hbar\\omega_m / k_bt)$ ] is the probability that the oscillator is in the phonon number state @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the boltzmann constant . to identify squeezing in position",
    ", we calculate the time - dependent uncertainty of the relevant quadrature @xmath12 . in heisenberg picture",

    "the uncertainty becomes minimum as @xmath80 that can further minimized by increasing @xmath81 .",
    "( [ sq - osc ] ) , the relative squeezing can be expressed in decibel unit as @xmath82\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -10\\log_{10}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{4g_{\\rm eff}}{4g_{\\rm eff}+\\omega_m}\\sin^2(qt)}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the relative squeezing @xmath83 thus does not depend upon the temperature .",
    "the maximum squeezing @xmath84 \\label{smax}\\ ] ] occurs at @xmath79 and it can be increased by increasing @xmath81 . in fig .",
    "2 , we show how the maximum attainable squeezing @xmath85 varies with @xmath81 when the atom is prepared in one of the eigenstates .",
    "it should be borne in mind that in the traditional models of quadratic coupling , the coupling strength @xmath25 between the cavity mode and the oscillator is much smaller than the linear coupling strength .",
    "this leads to the achievable squeezing only of the order of 1.8 db @xcite . in the present case",
    ", we consider a hybrid model , which provides us a flexibility to increase the effective coupling to a much larger value , leading to larger squeezing .",
    "for example , for @xmath86 @xcite , we have @xmath87 db , beating the standard 50% squeezing ( @xmath88 db ) limit for a bosonic system coupled to a thermal bath @xcite .",
    "further , this squeezing can be enhanced by moderately increasing @xmath26 ( see fig .",
    "this effectively leads to the strong coupling limit , that would be useful to drive the mechanical oscillator and that can be achieved just by using large classical pump fields .      as the evolution of the atom",
    "is effectively confined in the ground state manifold , the spontaneous emission may be ignored in the present study .",
    "further the cavity mode , after its adiabatic elimination , does not significantly affect the squeezing through its decay .",
    "in the present model , the primary source of decoherence is the coupling of the mechanical oscillator to the thermal phononic bath at a temperature @xmath66 , due to which the position uncertainty increases and becomes proportional to @xmath89 [ see eq .",
    "( [ sq - osc ] ) ] .    the effect of decoherence of the mechanical oscillator can be further analyzed in terms of squeezing spectrum , where we introduce another annihilation operator @xmath90 for the bosonic bath .",
    "the oscillator - bath interaction can be described by the following hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath91\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the frequency - dependent coupling constant . in this case , the heisenberg equation of motion of the mode @xmath14 can be written as @xmath93-\\frac{\\gamma}{2}b+\\sqrt{\\gamma}b_{i}(t)\\ ; , \\label{b - eq}\\ ] ] where we have chosen @xmath94 , as in the case of white bath and @xmath95c(\\omega , t_0)\\;.\\ ] ] the solution of eq .

    "3 , we display the spectrum of position uncertainty .",
    "it exhibits two maxima at the critical frequencies @xmath102 , where @xmath103 becomes minimum .",
    "note that the above variance ( [ var ] ) decreases as @xmath81 increases , referring to squeezing at a particular frequency @xmath104 ( see fig .",
    "we also find that as the decay rate @xmath105 of the oscillator increases , the uncertainty increases at @xmath106 .",
    "this suggests that the decoherence degrades squeezing .",
    "as discussed above , the atom - assisted squeezing is neither affected by the decay of the atom nor by the cavity mode . in addition",
    ", the squeezing can be controlled dynamically using external classical fields @xmath33 and @xmath26 , used for driving the atomic transition and the cavity mode , respectively . as clear from the eq .",
    "( [ sq - osc ] ) , the squeezing depends upon the effective atom - oscillator coupling constant @xmath107 . hence , for negligible cavity driving ( @xmath108 ) , the squeezing primarily depends upon the driving field @xmath33 .",
    "however in adiabatic limit , @xmath109 and therefore , the squeezing can not be increased substantially to a large value . on the other hand , for larger values of @xmath26",
    ", the squeezing can be increased as much as possible , as @xmath110 .",
    "for example , for @xmath111 and @xmath112 , one can have @xmath113 and the maximum squeezing as large as 6 db ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . we must emphasize that as @xmath26 increases , it does not substantially populate the cavity mode , as the cavity detuning @xmath114 is chosen to be large and therefore does not violate the condition of adiabatic elimination of cavity mode .",
    "we also note that an alternative way of achieving strong coupling regime could be to consider the microwave cavities and rydberg atoms that have negligible decay rates @xcite . in this way",
    ", the coupling strength @xmath25 between the cavity mode and the mechanical mode could be made larger .",
    "squeezing has also been considered by jhne _",
    "@xcite , who had driven the cavity with a 8 - 10 db squeezed light and thereafter transferred this squeezing to the mechanical oscillator to obtain 5 db mechanical squeezing for strong coupling @xmath115 . on the contrary",
    ", our technique does not rely upon such constraints . just by pumping the cavity using a highly detuned field",
    ", one can achieve a squeezing as large as @xmath116 db , even in the weak coupling limit .",
    "further , asjad _ et al . _",
    "@xcite had used a cavity , driven with a pulsed laser and obtained a squeezing @xmath11710 db using open - loop feedback control , for @xmath118 .",
    "this mechanism is however limited by requirement of high power short optical nanosecond pulses . in our case",
    ", a cw laser pump would suffice to achieve squeezing .",
    "girvin and coworkers @xcite had proposed to drive the cavity with two fields at different frequencies , but of equal strengths , while @xmath115 .",
    "this may lead to certain squeezing ; however , it is constrained to work in resolved side - band limit only ( @xmath3 is much larger than the cavity decay rate )",
    ". our proposal does not require to work in this condition , as the cavity mode is adiabatically eliminated .",
    "in conclusions , we consider a hybrid atom - optomechanical system with the membrane - in - the - middle setup .",
    "an atom is trapped inside the cavity and dispersively interacts with the cavity mode , leading to squeezing in the position quadrature of the mechanical oscillator .",
    "we show that this squeezing is independent of spontaneous emission of the atom and the cavity decay .",
    "we also discuss how the squeezing depends upon the initial preparation of the atomic state .",
    "the squeezing can further be enhanced by increasing @xmath81 , which can controlled externally by the classical fields that drive the atom and the cavity mode . as an example",
    ", we show that a squeezing of @xmath119 db of the oscillator can be attained for a strong coupling @xmath120 , that beats the standard 50% squeezing (= 3 db ) limit . we have also analytically derived the squeezing spectrum that exhibits two maxima , width of which increases by larger decay rate of the oscillator .",
