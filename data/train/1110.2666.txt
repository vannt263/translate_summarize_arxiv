    "a direct relation between shot noise and coulomb blockade of electron transport in mesoscopic conductors is well known . in normal conductors",
    "this relation was established theoretically @xcite and subsequently confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "later the same ideas were extended to subgap electron transport in normal - superconducting ( ns ) hybrids @xcite .",
    "the latter results appear to provide an adequate interpretation for experimental observations @xcite of coulomb effects in such systems .",
    "while all the above developments concern local electron transport and shot noise , the question arises if there also exists any general relation between non - locally correlated shot noise in multi - terminal conductors and coulomb effects on non - local electron transport in such systems .",
    "an important example is provided by three - terminal nsn structures which have recently received a great deal of attention in both experiments @xcite and theory @xcite in connection with the phenomenon of crossed andreev reflection .",
    "the latter phenomenon yields non - trivial behavior of the non - local subgap conductance in such structures .",
    "further interesting features emerge if one takes into account electron - electron interactions .",
    "one can observe , for example , the sign change of the non - local conductance caused either by the influence of the electromagnetic modes propagating along the wire @xcite , or by positive cross - correlations in non - local current noise @xcite .",
    "furthermore , positive cross - correlations in shot noise are directly linked to coulomb ani - blockade of non - local electron transport @xcite .",
    "thus , a general relation between cross - correlated shot noise and coulomb effects in non - local subgap electron transport in nsn systems turns out to be much richer than that in the local case @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will address the impact of electron - electron interactions on non - local effects in normal metallic structures depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_two_junctions ] .",
    "non - local properties of such systems turn out to be very sensitive to inelastic processes . at low temperatures",
    "such processes in metallic conductors usually become rather weak and electrons can propagate at long distances , typically of order microns , without suffering any significant energy changes . hence , provided voltage bias is applied to a mesoscopic conductor , its electron distribution function @xmath0 may substantially deviate from its equilibrium value universally defined by the fermi function @xmath1 . for example",
    ", low temperature distribution function @xmath0 may take the characteristic double - step form in comparatively short metallic wires attached to two big reservoirs with different electrostatic potentials @xcite .",
    "connecting the electrodes 3 and 4 via the two junctions with resistances @xmath2 , fano factors @xmath3 and capacitances @xmath4 .",
    "( b ) equivalent electric circuit of the system depicted in panel ( a ) . , width=283 ]    further interesting effects emerge if one takes into account an interplay between non - equilibrium effects and electron - electron interactions . consider , e.g. , a tunnel junction between two metallic leads . provided the the junction resistance significantly exceeds that of the leads , the effect of coulomb interaction can be modeled by introducing interactions between electrons and some linear electro - magnetic environment @xcite . in this case",
    "the strength of coulomb interaction is characterized by an effective impedance of the environment and the current across the tunnel junction reads @xmath5 p(e_l - e_r - ev ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & -   \\big[1-f_l(e_l)\\big]f_r(e_r)p(-e_l+e_r+ev ) \\big\\ } , \\label{pofe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 are the electron distribution functions in the left and right electrodes and @xmath7 is the probability to excite a photon with energy @xmath8 due to interaction between the junction and the environment .",
    "provided the environment has a non - zero impedance and both distribution functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are close to the fermi function , eq . ( [ pofe ] ) yields the well known zero - bias anomaly on the i - v curve , i.e. the coulomb blockade dip in the differential conductance @xmath11 in the limit of low voltages @xcite .",
    "furthermore , should at least one of the distribution functions deviate from the equilibrium one , the i - v curve can receive further significant modifications .",
    "for instance , if one distribution function takes the double step form @xcite , it follows immediately from eq .",
    "( [ pofe ] ) that the coulomb blockade dip in the conductance should split into two separate dips .",
    "these dips can be  and have been @xcite  detected experimentally thus offering a possibility to investigate non - equilibrium effects with the aid of small capacitance tunnel junctions as it was demonstrated , e.g. , by experimental analysis of the impact of magnetic impurities on inelastic relaxation of electrons in normal metals @xcite .    despite clear advantages and simplicity of eq .",
    "( [ pofe ] ) , it might not always be convenient to employ in order to analyze combined effects of non - equilibrium and coulomb interaction in metallic conductors . indeed , the applicability of eq .",
    "( [ pofe ] ) is restricted to junctions with very low barrier transmissions , i.e. the effect of higher transmissions can not be correctly accounted for my means of this equation . the latter effect might be important , in particular if one needs to evaluate the non - local conductance .",
    "in addition , the function @xmath7 is usually evaluated under the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium in electromagnetic environment , which effectively implies equilibrium electron distributions in both leads . if , however , the electron subsystem is driven out of equilibrium , self - consistent evaluation of @xmath7 might become a non - trivial problem .",
    "furthermore , the function @xmath7 would in general be difficult to evaluate for effectively non - linear electromagnetic environments .",
    "the above complications are avoided within the kinetic equation analysis presented below .",
    "this approach only requires resistances of metallic leads to remain smaller than the quantum resistance unit @xmath12 . within the same theoretical framework it allows to evaluate both non - local shot noise and the effect of electron - electron interactions on non - local electron transport in normal metallic conductors as well as to describe a non - trivial interplay between coulomb effects and inelastic processes in such structures",

    "[ fig_two_junctions ] one of the junctions , e.g. the junction 2 , may be viewed as an injector , which drives electron distribution function in the wire out of equilibrium .",

    "one of the ways to observe such effects is to study the non - local differential conductance @xmath41 of our system . clearly , in such kind of experiments",
    "the distance between the junctions should not exceed an effective electron inelastic relaxation length @xmath42 which sets the scale for non - equilibrium effects in the wire at a given temperature .",

    "finally we note that the above particular system geometry is chosen merely for the sake of definiteness .",
    "the key steps of our subsequent analysis and the results obtained from it remain applicable to a much broader class of systems than that depicted in fig . [ fig_two_junctions ] .",
    "e.g. , the wire may be replaced by a metallic lead of any shape , and ultimately all geometry specific details can be absorbed in few elements of the conductance matrix .",
    "we begin with the analysis of shot noise employing the so - called boltzmann - langevin technique @xcite based on a kinetic equation for the electron distribution function @xmath44 .",
    "low frequency cross - correlated shot noise in multi - terminal metallic structures has already been studied before , see , e.g. , ref . . here",

    "we will extend this approach in order to include electron - electron interactions where more involved calculations will be necessary .",
    "the boltzmann - langevin kinetic equation accounts for current noise produced by the junctions 1 and 2 and has the form @xmath45 here @xmath46 and @xmath33 are respectively the electron diffusion constant and the electron density of states at the fermi energy inside the wire .",
