    "there are many situations in which it is necessary to consider topological relations among one - dimensional objects that are homeomorphic to rings .",
    "the most significant examples are provided by long flexible polymers and biopolymers , whose trajectories may close themselves and form what in the polymer scientific literature are called _ catenanes _ @xcite@xcite .",
    "the latter are able to entangle themeselves giving rise to complex links involving two or more interlocked chains .",
    "additionally , each catenanae may be in the configuration of a nontrivial knot .",

    "link invariants_. in the following , we will be interested in the topological relations of a system of a linked rings without taking into account the fact that these rings could be also in a nontrivial knot configuration as for example in fig .",
    "[ loop ]  a ) . for this reason",
    ", we will discuss here only link invariants .",
    "it is well known that the correlation functions of the observables of a topological field theory are topological invariants . moreover , the coefficients of the perturbative expansion of those correlation functions are topological invariants too . in practice , this means that to a finite set of feynman diagrams it is possible to associate a given topological invariant .",
    "our purpose is to solve the inverse problem .",
    "this means that , starting from a given topological invariant , we would like to obtain a topological field theory with a finite set of feynman diagrams and a correlation function which is a function of that invariant . this is the program of topological engineering that has been stated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the last few decades",
    "topological theories with the above characteristics have been extensively applied in the statistical mechanics of polymers , see for instance @xcite@xcite and @xcite . the most popular approach used in order to distinguish the different topological configurations of the one - dimensional objects",
    "is based on the _ gauss linking number _ ( gln ) .",
    "the corresponding topological field theory is an abelian bf model discussed in ref .",
    "the goal of this work is to extend this approach based on the gln to the case of polymer dynamics , in which the shape of the linked trajectories is not static , but changes in time .",
    "the program of topological engineering in the case of links may be summarized as follows : +    _ let @xmath3 be a link invariant , which describes the topological properties of a @xmath4component link @xmath5 .",
    "it is required that : _    * the invariant @xmath3 is explicitly written as a functional of trajectories @xmath6 of knots composing the link .",
    "+ given a link invariant of this kind , find a topological field theory with observables @xmath7 such that @xmath3 , or equivalently a function @xmath8 $ ] of it , can be expressed as the correlator of these observables @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the action of a system and @xmath11 is a set of fields that can be scalars , vectors or higher order tensors .    the topological field theory and its observables should satisfy the following conditions :    * each observable @xmath12 , @xmath13 , must depend on the trajectory of only one knot * no further regularization should be necessary in order to compute the correlator @xmath14 , apart from the usual regularization schemes required by the possible presence of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "an example of topological engineering is based on the gln and the abelian bf field theory .",
    "the gln is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are spatial curves in three dimensions that represent respectively the closed trajectories @xmath1 and @xmath2 of two polymers @xmath18 and @xmath0 .",
    "the greek indexes @xmath19 denote the spatial components . here",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 represent the arc - lengths on the curves @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are defined in a such a way that @xmath22 and @xmath23 . to find a field theory which is associated to the invariant @xmath24 , we rewrite ( [ gln ] ) as follows @xmath25 where",
    "@xmath26 are called the bond vectors densities and @xmath27 let us note that @xmath28 coincides with the propagator of the abelian bf model discussed in ref .  @xcite . to make the connection with the bf model even more explicit ,",
    "we have introduced a new parameter @xmath29 , which will play later the role of the coupling constant of that model .",
    "clearly , the addition of this parameter is irrelevant . as a matter of fact , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ gln_alt ] ) does not depend on @xmath29 .",
    "now the quantity @xmath30 can be regarded as the generating functional of a gaussian field theory with propagator @xmath28 for the very special choice of currents ( [ currents ] ) .",
    "it is easy to recognize that the underlaying field theory is an abelian bf model with action @xmath31 it is possible to show that the abelian version of the bf model is actually equivalent to two abelian c - s field theories . if we quantize the above topological field theory using the lorentz gauge fixing , in which both fields @xmath32 and @xmath33 are completely transverse , we obtain the following relation @xmath34 the above equation is the analog of eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) in the present case .",
    "there are just two observables @xmath35 and @xmath36 , namely the two abelian wilson loops given below : @xmath37",
    "in this section we would like to extend the program of topological engineering to the case of two trajectories whose configurations are changing during time .",
    "this problem is very important to study the dynamics of two entangled polymers .",
    "once again , we choose the gauss linking invariant in order to impose topological conditions on two closed trajectories @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the only difference from the previous static example is that now the curves @xmath38 and @xmath39 depend on time , i.e. @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the gln can still be defined , but will be a time dependent quantities : @xmath42 of course , if the trajectories would be impenetrable , then @xmath43 would be a constant , since it is not possible to change the topological configuration of a system of knots if their trajectories are not allowed to cross themselves",
    ". however , in the absence of excluded volume interactions models of polymer physics are phantom , i.e. crossings are allowed .",
    "for this reason , we will require that only the time average of the gln is fixed . as a consequence",
    ", we will consider a time averaged version of the gln on the time interval @xmath44 $ ] : @xmath45    next , we generalize eq .",
    "( [ genfun ] ) to the case of dynamics . to this purpose , we introduce the following field theory @xmath46 the above action differs from that of eq .",
    "( [ bfaction ] ) by the addition of the fourth dimension represented by variable @xmath47 , with @xmath48 .",
    "note that @xmath49 is not invariant under diffeomorphism on the whole dimensional space spanned by the coordinates @xmath50 and @xmath47 , but only on its three dimensional spatial section . as a consequence ,",
    "strictly speaking @xmath49 does not describe a topological field theory .",
    "the propagator corresponding to the action ( [ actiondyn ] ) in the lorentz gauge is given by @xmath51 the analog of eq .",
    "( [ genfun ] ) is @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ genfungen ] ) can be seen as the amplitude of the two observables @xmath55 to prove eq .",
    "( [ genfungen ] ) it is sufficient to perform the gaussian integration in the fields @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the result of that operation is @xmath58 using the explicit expression of the propagator @xmath59 given in eq .",
    "( [ propdyn ] ) it is possible to verify eq .",
    "( [ genfungen ] ) after eliminating the spurious variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 : @xmath62 } \\label{endofstory}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the right hand side of above equation coincides with @xmath63 .",
    "this completes our proof .",
    "in this work the program of topological engineering has been extended to the case of the dynamics of two polymer chains .",
    "in particular , the gauss linking invariant has been considered .",
    "it has been shown that a time average version of this topological invariant can be reproduced from an amplitude of a field theory in the form of eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) .",
    "this amplitude is given in eq .",
    "( [ genfungen ] ) . due to the fact that the conformations of the chains change during time ,",
    "the underlying field theory is four dimensional and it is topological only with respect to diffeomorphisms of the spatial section of four dimensional space .",
