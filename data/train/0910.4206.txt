    "the last ten years have witnessed tremendous developments in the control of systems at the nanoscale , allowing the fabrication of artificial structures that are effectively two - dimensional @xcite , one - dimensional @xcite or zero - dimensional @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , progress in optical trapping of atoms have also lead to the possibility of realizing quantum systems of controllable effective dimensionality @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", these low dimensional systems are expected to exhibit a rich physics resulting from quantum coherence which is now becoming experimentally accessible .",
    "a particularly striking property in low dimension is the phenomenon of anderson localisation @xcite , in which disorder makes the wavefunction of particles localised . in both one @xcite and two @xcite dimensions , any small amount of disorder",
    "is expected to localise all particles . in one dimension ,",
    "random matrix theories have provided a highly detailed understanding of the localisation phenomenon @xcite , while in two dimensions the regime of weak localisation has been thoroughly studied .",
    "our group has been exploring at a theoretical level the physics of localisation in low - dimensional artificial structures .",
    "two main lines of research have been emphasised . in the first one , @xcite , reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : spinglasses ] , mesoscopic samples of metallic spin glasses are analysed . in these systems ,",
    "the underlying disorder is generated by the spin glass state , and weak localisation is used as a tool to probe its statistical properties .",
    "the fluctuations of observable quantities such as the conductance and the correlations between them in the weak localisation regime are shown to provide information on the overlap between the states of the spin glass of the spin glass state . in the second line of research , reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : coldatoms ] , trapped bosonic atomic gases are considered .",
    "@xcite in these systems , in contrast to the spin glass systems , there is a high degree of control of the disorder acting on the system , and the aim is to explore how anderson localisation is affected by the interaction and the statistics of the quantum particles , a long standing problem of condensed matter physics",
    "spin glasses are amorphous magnetic phases . the canonical examples of such glasses are obtained by doping with magnetic impurities noble non - magnetic metals , such as cu : mn , ag : mn , au : fe . at high enough concentrations ,",
    "the coupling between the randomly located impurities lead to the appearance of a new magnetic phase . in this phase ,",
    "the spins are frozen but lack any simple long range order .",
    "the analogy with conventional glasses is at the origin of the denomination of this magnetic phase .",
    "the understanding of the nature of this frozen phase and the associated transition from the paramagnetic phase has motivated numerous experimental , theoretical and numerical works over the last three decades .",
    "experimentally , this freezing manifest itself through the sharp reduction of magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 below the glass transition ( but not on _ e.g _ the specific heat ) .",
    "this decrease of @xmath1 is accompanied by a broad spectrum of the imaginary part of @xmath2 , manifesting the very slow magnetic relaxation in the spin glass phase . indeed ,",
    "no intrinsic time scale characteristic of this relaxation can be determined experimentally : the spin glass is said to be aging .",
    "its only relevant time scale is its age @xmath3 : correlation and response functions are not stationary and depend explicitly on both times @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this dependence on history of the spin glass properties possesses remarkable properties : for example , the spin susceptibility @xmath0 crucially depends on the presence or not of a small magnetic field upon cooling through the transition temperature ( field cooled or zero field cooled protocols ) .",
    "the response of the aging properties of the thermo - remanent magnetisation to small variations of temperatures manifest the so - called memory and rejuvenation effects .",
    "these unusual properties have focused the attention of a large community of condensed matter theoreticians .",
    "most studies have focused on the ising spin glass , expected to describe the low energy excitations in the presence of spin anisotropy ( originating from _ e.g. _ spin - orbit coupling ) . for ising spin glasses , g. parisi proposed a mean field ansatz which is now understood to be exact @xcite .",
    "in this mean field solution for the statics , the phase space is complex with different ergodic components ( see @xcite for pedagogical reviews ) .",
    "these ergodic components correspond to different pure states .",
    "naively , we expect from such a mean field scenario that whenever we enter the spin glass phase by crossing the transition temperature , we end up in a randomly chosen ergodic component where relaxation dynamics takes place . if we repeat the quenching procedure in the same sample , we can end up in another of these ergodic component .",
    "history dependence follows directly .",
    "the number of different ergodic components ( or `` energy valleys '' ) depends of the complexity of the phase space , and is encoded in the distribution of probability of distances between these pure states .",
    "these distances are conveniently encoded using the overlap between spin configurations .",
    "let us consider two classical spin configurations @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( same positions of the spins , but different orientations ) .",
    "the overlap between these configurations is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of magnetic impurities ( spins ) . for ising spins",
    ", this overlap will count by how many spins flips the configurations @xmath5 and @xmath6 differ .",
    "the distribution of overlaps is a central object in the parisi s mean field solution @xcite , and its distribution is indeed the proposed order parameter for the spin glass transition .",
    "moreover besides allowing to encode part of the complexity of the phase space , this overlap is also a useful tool to measure variations of a spin configuration under variation of an external parameter ( temperature or magnetic field ) , or as time evolves , for which configurations @xmath9 and @xmath10 corresponds to different times ( see _ e.g _ @xcite ) .",
    "coming back to the mean field solution , its relevance to the physical situation @xmath11 is still an active domain of research . besides this static solution ,",
    "solutions of mean - field dynamics have been obtained by cugliandolo and kurchan ( see @xcite for a recent detailed review ) .",
    "mean field aging dynamics can also be described in the so - called weak - ergodicity scenario proposed by bouchaud @xcite . moreover ,",
    "even the complexity of the phase space have been questioned . in another proposal based on scaling ideas @xcite ,",
    "the peculiar properties of spin glasses are attributed solely to the aging dynamics , without any need for a complex phase space . in this phenomenological theory , the slow dynamics",
    "is described analogously to the evolution of a quenched ferromagnet : domains of various sizes and shapes evolve slowly in time .",
    "it is fair to say that , while these numerous results have deepened our understanding of the amazing properties of spin glasses , a complete understanding of real spin glasses is still lacking .",
    "the purpose of our work is to propose another experimentally accessible probe of metallic spin glasses , allowing interesting and crucial comparisons with current theories .      in this work , we take advantage of the metallic nature of canonical spin glasses and consider their electronic transport properties in the coherent regime . in metals ,",
    "electron s inelastic scattering off _",
    "e.g. _ phonons limit the phase coherence of these electrons .",
    "this dephasing can be described phenomenologically by a dephasing length scale @xmath12 beyond which phase coherence can be safely neglected when describing transport properties . at room temperatures ,",
    "the high density of phonons induce an @xmath12 much smaller than conductors sizes : the classical drude theory correctly describes the conductance of metallic wires .",
    "however upon lowering the temperature , @xmath12 increases up to a few @xmath13 , allowing to study transport in wires of size comparable to @xmath12 .",
    "when describing the electronic transport through such devices , interferences effects have to be taken into account : this is the so - called mesoscopic regime ( for a recent and very detailed introduction to this field , see @xcite ) . in this regime ,",
    "the conductance is sample dependent .",
    "moreover , when applying a small magnetic field transverse to the wire , the conductance fluctuates in a random manner .",
    "the corresponding magneto - conductance trace is considered as a fingerprint of the configuration of disorder in the sample : two samples with the same amount of disorder differ by the exact realization of the random potential .",
    "hence they display magneto - conductance traces that are different , but with the same amplitude .    in a metallic spin glass , part of the randomness",
    "consists in the random orientations of the impurities magnetic moments .",
    "the influence of these random spins on the fluctuations of the conductance was soon realised by altshuler and spivak @xcite and specific consequences of the droplet theory of spin glasses were discussed in @xcite .",
    "experimentally , de vegvar _ et al . _ pioneered the mesoscopic transport studies in metallic spin glasses by clearly demonstrating the existence of reproducible magneto - conductance traces below the glass transition in cu : mn wires @xcite . by using the antisymmetric component of conductance upon time - reversal symmetry , they attributed the appearance of these coherent conductance fluctuations to the freezing of impurities spins . in parallel ,",
    "focused on the electrical noise in spin glass cu : mn wires , _",
    "i.e. _ on the time dependence of conductance fluctuations @xcite . the dynamical characteristics of these spontaneous fluctuations were analysed in view of both the mean - field and the droplets theories of spin glasses ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , comparison with existing theoretical ideas @xcite was hampered by the necessity of averaging over the conductance distribution in theoretical predictions .",
    "later , universal conductance fluctuations were analysed in diluted magnetic semiconductor in the spin glass regime @xcite . in these compound ,",
    "a rapid increase of the amplitude of these fluctuations was noted below the spin glass transition temperature , as well as the usual field cooled / zero field cooled dependence of these fluctuations .",
    "more recently , similar studies have been conducted on au : fe wires @xcite .",
    "these different studies have validated the use of mesoscopic conductance fluctuations as an interesting new tool to probe the spin glass freezing .",
    "most of this work have focused on either the amplitude of these fluctuations , or their time - dependence ( electrical noise ) . in the present study",
    ", we consider the correlation between traces of magneto - conductance as a new and most relevant way to analyse spin glass properties .",
    "we now focus on the description of electron s coherent transport in a metallic spin glass . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the spin glass phase , and motivated by previous experimental results we will assume that the dephasing length scale @xmath12 ( which is dominated by spins able to flip during the diffusion time scale ) is comparable with sample size .",
    "the spins that do not contribute to @xmath12 are then described by frozen classical spins with random orientations ( we do not assume these spins to be ising like ) .",
    "we consider lattice model describing the electrons in the presence of these impurities which contribute both to a scalar potential @xmath14 and a magnetic part @xmath15 : @xmath16 the transport properties of this model in the coherent regime were analysed both using diagrammatic perturbation theory @xcite , and a numerical landauer approach @xcite .",
    "this last technique consists in obtaining the conductance of a finite sample for a given configuration of disorder , _",
    "i.e _ without any averaging procedure . following landauer formula ,",
    "this conductance is deduced from the electron s scattering matrix of the system connected to two reservoirs . in this numerical procedure ,",

    "this fact is intimately related with the existence of a finite localisation threshold associated with the quasiperiodic potential : analogously to what happens at the single particle level , when the intersite hopping exceeds a critical value the quasiperiodic potential has no localising effect on the collective modes of the system , so that the bose - glass phase is not observed , and a conventional phase transition between mi and sf can take place with the onset of gapless and propagating collective modes .",

    "such phases reflect the intermediate nature of the quasi - periodic potential : in fact gapless and incoherent bg regions alternate with gapped incommensurate - band - insulator ( ibi ) regions , which are the quasi - periodic analog of conventional band insulators appearing in interacting bosonic models in a commensurate superlattice @xcite . in the limit of a deep quasiperiodic potential",
    ", the ibi phase can be associated to the opening of a finite gap for addition of a particle in any of the potential wells of the harper potential : in this case an incommensurate `` shell '' of localised state is filled , and to start filling the next shell a gap needs to be overcome .",
    "this phenomenon does not occur in the case of a truly random potential , because the potential wells are not bounded in size , and hence the `` charging energy '' of each well can be arbitrarily small , making the system gapless at all fillings .",
    "the above results show that a very rich showcase of quantum phases can be implemented by experiments with strongly interacting bosons in incommensurate optical superlattices .",
    "nonetheless the fundamental question remains on how one can detect experimentally the occurrence of such phases and all the details of complicated phase diagrams .",
    "this question is ultimately related with the potential use of these physical systems as analog quantum simulators @xcite , capable of providing the answer to open theoretical questions concerning models which are implemented literally in the experiment .",

    "in particular the gapless excitations of a bg are particle excitations , hole excitations , and particle - hole ones , and they are probed directly by the compressibility , which is indeed finite in the bg phase .",
    "the trapping potential confining the atoms offers the possibility of probing the compressibility by studying the response of the system to the increase of the trapping frequency ( `` trap squeezing '' ) .",
    "indeed such an operation tries to push particles from the trap wings towards the centre , where new particles are accepted only if the local state of the system has a vanishing gap to particle addition . hence measuring a finite response of the average density in the centre of the trap upon increasing the trap frequency amounts to probing the realization of a locally compressible phase in the trap centre .    knowing that this phase actually corresponds to a bg requires the additional information on short - range coherence .",
    "the phase coherence of trapped cold atoms can be measured with time - of - flight measurements , which reveal the momentum distribution and in particular the zero - momentum component ( coherent fraction ) :    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is the total particle number .",
    "in particular , if a particle is added to a bg phase , it will occupy a anderson localised quasi - particle state , and hence it will not increase the coherent fraction of the system . consequently a bg phase realised in the centre of the trap should be identified with a finite response of the central density to trap squeezing and on the simultaneous absence of response in the coherent fraction .",
    "this is indeed what it is observed in qmc simulations on trapped bosons subject to a variable trapping potential , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.squeezing ] .",
    "the realization of such a behaviour occurs for values of the chemical potential which correspond to bg behaviour of the homogeneous system , so that this type of measurement allows to reconstruct the phase diagram of the system _ in absence _ of the trap .",
    "the major requirement of this proposal is the measurement of the average density over a region of a linear size of @xmath113 m , corresponding to 10 - 20 lattice sites .",
    "this is indeed possible with current large - aperture optics @xcite .",
