    "in our ongoing araucaria project , we are improving on the usefulness of a number of stellar distance indicators by determining their environmental dependences from a study of these objects in a number of nearby galaxies with largely different environmental parameters .",
    "we have described our approach in a number of previous papers ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; gieren et al .",
    "cepheid variables are among the most important distance indicators we are studying . in spite of recent claims about a possible non - universality of the period - luminosity ( pl ) relation ( sandage et al .",
    "2004 , marconi et al .",
    "2005 ) , or a break in the relation at a period of about 10 days ( ngeow et al .",
    "2005 , marconi et al . 2005 ) , previous results of the araucaria project seem to indicate that the pl relation is a superb instrument for distance measurement , particularly in the near - infrared where reddening is not a significant source of systematic error ( gieren et al .",
    "2005b , 2005c ; pietrzyski et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "we have been conducting wide - field optical photometric surveys for cepheid variables in all target galaxies of the project ; so far , results were reported for ngc 300 ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "2002 ; gieren et al . 2004 ) and ngc 6822 ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "we have also been carrying out near - ir ( jk ) follow - up observations of cepheids in all araucaria target galaxies ; results were reported in gieren et al .",
    "2005c ( ngc 300 ) , and pietrzyski et al .",
    "2006 ( ic 1613 ) .",
    "these studies have shown that a combined optical / near - infrared analysis of cepheid variables in nearby , well resolved galaxies can yield distances accurate to 3 percent .    in this paper",
    ", we are extending our cepheid work to the local group irregular galaxy ngc 3109 , with the aim to provide a sample of cepheids with well - observed light curves in v and i bands which is near - complete over the whole spatial extent of the galaxy , and down to a pulsation period of about 4 days .",
    "this survey complements , and enlarges previous surveys which have covered only small areas in ngc 3109 , or which lacked the sensitivity to discover the population of short - period and relatively faint variables .",
    "our new cepheid observations give us a superb database to improve on the previous cepheid - based distance determinations of ngc 3109 of sandage & carlson ( 1988 ) , capaccioli et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and musella et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which we exploit in section 4 of this paper .    in the first , photographic study of ngc 3109",
    "sandage & carlson ( 1988 ) had discovered 29 cepheids . in this study",
    ", we recovered 28 of these 29 variables , which are among the brightest cepheids in the galaxy .",
    "the sandage & carlson cepheid variable v12 was not recovered in our survey because it fell in the gap between the two ccds which we used to image the galaxy ( fig .",
    "capaccioli , piotto and bresolin ( 1992 ) did not discover additional cepheids but rather corrected the b - band zero point of sandage s photometry and improved on the distance determination .",
    "later musella , piotto and capaccioli ( 1997 ) obtained bvri light curves for 24 cepheids in a small field of ngc 3109 , 16 of which were newly discovered , and bringing the total number of known cepheid variables in the galaxy to 45 .",
    "we did not detect 6 out of 16 new cepheids reported by musella , piotto and capaccioli ( 1997 ) .",
    "three of them , p4 , p8 and p11 have periods of about 2 days and are clearly too faint on our images to be able to derive reliable photometry for them . the cepheids designated as p7 and p9",
    "are heavily blended and we suspect that they may have been spurious detections . finally , p15 is not a stellar object - most probably it is a background galaxy .",
    "our current survey enlarges the known cepheid population in ngc 3109 to 113 objects and is the first comprehensive survey of cepheids in this galaxy which is near - complete to rather short periods ( about 4 days ) , and over the complete spatial extent of ngc 3109 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we desribe the observations , calibrations and data reduction procedures . in section 3",
    ", we present the catalog of cepheid variables in ngc 3109 obtained from our observations , and in section 4 we discuss the pl relations obtained from our data , and use them to determine the distance to ngc 3109 .",
    "we discuss our results in section 5 and summarize the main conclusions of the paper in section 6 .",
    "all the data presented in this paper were collected with the warsaw 1.3 m telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "the telescope was equipped with a mosaic 8 chip detector , with a field of view of about 35 x 35 arcmin and a scale of 0.25 arcsec / pixel . for more details on the instrumental system ,",
    "the reader is referred to the ogle web site ( www.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle ) .",
    "the observations were secured on 74 different nights during two consecutive observing seasons . on each night",
    ", 900 sec integrations were performed through v and i filters .",
    "after preliminary reductions with the iraf package ( e.g. debiasing , flatfielding ) the data were reduced with the ogle iii pipeline on the basis of the image - subtraction technique ( udalski 2003 , woniak 2000 ) .    in order to calibrate our photometry onto the standard system , about 25 landolt standards were observed together with our target field during three photometric nights .",
    "standard stars were observed on each of the chips , and transformation coefficients were derived independently for each chip , and on each of the three photometric nights . in order to account for small variations of the zero point in both filters over the mosaic field",
    ", we adopted the correction maps elaborated by pietrzyski et al .",
    "we estimated the accuracy of the zero points of our photometry to be better than 0.03 mag in both filters .",
    "2 shows a comparison of our photometry with the photometry obtained by hidalgo et al .",
    "( in preparation ) with the 2.5 m du pont telescope at las campanas .",
    "it turns out that in both filters the zero points are consistent at the 0.03 mag level ( e.g. within the quoted errors ) .",
    "all stars observed in ngc 3109 were searched for photometric variations with periods between 0.2 and 100 days , using the analysis of variance algorithm ( schwarzenberg - czerny 1989 ) . in order to distinguish cepheids from other types of variable stars",
    ", we used the same criteria as in pietrzyski et al .",
    "all light curves of those variables identified as cepheid candidates were approximated by fourier series of order 4 .",
    "we then rejected those objects with v amplitudes smaller than 0.4 mag , which is approximately the lower amplitude limit for normal classical cepheids .",
    "for the stars passing our selection criteria , mean v and i magnitudes were derived by integrating their light curves , which had been previously converted onto an intensity scale , and converting the results back to the magnitude scale . because of the very good quality and phase coverage of our light curves , the statistical accuracy of the derived mean magnitudes was typically 0.01 mag for the brighter variables , and 0.02 - 0.03 mag for the faintest cepheids in our catalog .",
    "we ended up with a list of 113 bona fide classical cepheids with periods between 31.4 and 3.4 days .",
    "there are evidently no truly long - period cepheids in ngc 3109 , with periods up to 50 days or more , as in most other galaxies of the araucaria project we have studied so far .",
    "table 1 gives the individual photometric v and i observations for all cepheid variables we found .",
    "the full table 1 is available in electronic form . in table 2 , we present their identifications , equatorial coordinates , periods , times of maximum light in v , mean v- and i - band intensity magnitudes , and cross - identifications with previous surveys .",
    "the accuracy of the periods can be judged from the last digits given in column 4 of table 2 ; it is typically a few units of the last digit .",
    "we note here that for 14 cepheids previously discovered in ngc 3109 , the reported periods were wrong . for the remaining variables with first - epoch observations",
    ", our new data helped to improve the periods significantly .    in fig .",
    "3 , we show phased v- and i - band light curves for some of the variables in our catalog which are typical for other cepheids of similar periods , in order to demonstrate the quality of our data .",
    "for the purpose of studying the pl relations defined by the cepheids in ngc 3109 , and determine the distance of the galaxy , we excluded all variables with periods less than logp ( days)=0.75 ( 5.6 days ) .",
    "this period cutoff was chosen because shortward of it the scatter of the data points in the pl plane starts to increase significantly , as a consequence of the increasingly lower signal - to - noise ratio in the photometry .",
    "also , below a period of 5.6 days contamination of the sample with first - overtone pulsators is expected to become a problem as impressively demonstrated in the lmc pl relations provided by the different microlensing projects ( e.g. udalski et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "4 shows the location of all cepheids in our catalog on the period - magnitude planes in v and i. stars with periods shorter than the adopted cutoff period , as well as a very few outliers , are marked with open symbols in these plots . our final cepheid sample used for the analysis of the pl relations in ngc 3109 , excluding the stars marked with open circles in fig .",
    "4 , contains 83 objects .",
    "this subsample of cepheids should not contain peculiar , or strongly blended stars , and it should be free of contaminating overtone pulsators whose inclusion in the sample would tend to make the derived cepheid distance to ngc 3109 too short . in fig .",
    "4 , an indication of a possible change of the slope at the log(p ) = 1.2 can be noticed , but it can not be clearly verified due to the relatively small number of long period cepheids in ngc 3109 . however , since the slopes of the p - l relations ( see below ) agree relatively well with the corresponding slopes obtained for the lmc cepheids this effect should not affect our distance determination significantly . a plot of the location of these 83 variables on the v , v - i color - magnitude diagram in fig .",
    "5 shows that all these stars , with the sole possible exception of one rather blue object , are indeed located in the cepheid instability zone , giving support to our conclusion that we have isolated a very nearly uncontaminated sample of classical cepheids in ngc 3109 for our study of the pl relation , and its application for the determination of the distance to the galaxy .    in agreement with our usual procedure ( e.g. gieren et al .",
    "2004 , pietrzyski et al .",
    "2004 ) , we performed fits to a straight line to the 83 datapoints in the pl planes adopting for this purpose the slopes of the lmc cepheid pl relations established by the ogle - ii project ( udalski 2000 ) .",
    "free fits to the datapoints which do not pre - specify the slopes , yield slopes which agree with the adopted lmc slopes within the combined 2 @xmath1 uncertainties , yielding no evidence for any significant departure of the ngc 3109 pl relation slopes in v and i from the fiducial lmc pl relations , in line with our previous findings for ngc 300 and ngc 6822 ( gieren et al .",
    "2004 , pietrzyski et al .",
    "2004 ) . fitting the ogle lmc slopes to our data",
    "yields the following relations : + v = -2.775 log p + ( 24.418 @xmath0 0.048 ) + i = -2.977 log p + ( 23.833 @xmath0 0.042 ) + wi = -3.000 log p + ( 22.908 @xmath0 0.051 ) + the linear regressions to our v , i , and wi cepheid pl relations are shown in fig . 6 and 7 . in the case of the wi index we excluded four more widely oustanding objects : cep033 , cep057 , cep078 and cep082 .",
    "all of them have either very blue or very red colors , what coused their abnormal locations on the wi pl relation .    assuming the schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) reddening law , in agreement with our previous work in the araucaria project , a foreground reddening towards ngc 3109 of e(v - i ) = 0.05 mag ( minniti , zijlstra and alonso 1999 ) , and adopting a true lmc distance modulus of 18.5 , we derive from the above zero points true distance moduli of ngc 3109 of 25.72 @xmath0 0.05 mag in the v band , and 25.66 @xmath0 0.04 in the i band .",
    "we adopt the distance modulus of 25.54 @xmath0 0.05 mag , derived from the reddening - free wesenheit magnitudes as our best result",
    ". as one can see it is significantly shorter than the corresponding distance moduli obtained based on the v and i band magnitudes .",
    "a straightforward explanation is that in addition to our adopted extinction ( e(b - v ) = 0.05 mag ) , we do have some contribution to the e(b - v ) related to the intrinsic ( to ngc 3109 ) extinction . indeed assuming an additional intrinsic reddening of 0.05 mag the distances derived for the v and i band agree within 0.02 mag with our adopted distance modulus from the wesenheit index .",
    "we would like to note that we found an identical situation studying cepheid p - l relations in the optical v and i bands in ngc 300 ( gieren et al .",
    "2004 ) and also postulated an additional intrinsic reddening as the most reasonable explanation .",
    "recently gieren et al . ( 2005c ) measured the total extinction in this galaxy from combined optical and infrared data of cepheids and indeed confirmed this suspition .",
    "we will precisely measure the total extinction of ngc 3109 once we will have analyzed follow - up near - infrared photometry of a subsample of the cepheids in this galaxy .",
    "our adopted cepheid distance to ngc 3109 derived from optical photometry in the v and i bands is 25.54 @xmath0 0.05 mag ( statistical error ) .",
    "this distance value compares very well to previous distance determinations of ngc 3109 from cepheid variables , and the trgb method .",
    "the most recent determination from cepheids is the one by musella , piotto and capaccioli ( 1997 ) who analyzed bvri photometry of 24 cepheids and obtained a true distance modulus of 25.67 mag .",
    "capaccioli et al .",
    "( 1992 ) had obtained a distance of 25.50 @xmath0 0.16 mag , from b - band photographic photometry of 21 cepheids .",
    "lee ( 1993 ) obtained a true distance modulus of 25.55 @xmath0 0.1 mag from the location of the i - band trgb in ngc 3109 , very similar to the more modern value of 25.61 @xmath0 0.1 mag of minniti , zijlstra and alonso ( 1999 ) .",
    "another very recent determination from the trgb method gives 25.66 @xmath0 0.1 mag ( hidalgo et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    as detailed in several of our previous papers in this series , for the scientific purposes of the araucaria project we are interested in obtaining a set of galaxy distances of the highest possible accuracy .",
    "we have shown ( gieren et al . 2005c , bresolin et al .",
    "2005 , pietrzyski et al .",
    "2006 ) that by combining high - quality optical and near - infrared photometry of cepheids , distance determinations accurate to 3 percent seem possible , minimizing systematic problems with blending with unresolved companion stars , and most importantly with reddening , which seems to be the most critical single systematic factor which can bias distance determinations to nearby galaxies based on optical photometry alone .",
    "we therefore prefer to postpone an exhaustive discussion of the various systematic uncertainties affecting our current distance result for ngc 3109 to a follow - up paper which will present near - infrared photometry of a subsample of the cepheids studies in the optical spectral range in this paper , and which will derive the ultimate , most accurate distance to ngc 3109 from its population of cepheid variables .",
    "the principal value of the present paper is the presentation of a catalog of cepheid variables in this rather distant local group galaxy which increases the size of the known cepheid sample by almost a factor of 3 , presents high - quality light curves and periods for all these variables .",
    "we have conducted a wide - field survey for cepheid variables in the local group galaxy ngc 3109 which covers the entire spatial content of the galaxy , and which is complete to cepheid periods down to about 4 days .",
    "the survey was conducted in the v and i bands on 70 nights distributed over an interval of approximately one year .",
    "we have discovered 113 cepheid variables with periods in the range from 31.4 to 3.4 days .",
    "most of the previously known ( 45 ) cepheids were re - discovered in our survey ; for a number of these variables with first - epoch data we were able to improve very significantly on the periods with our data , and show that for 14 objects the previously determined periods were wrong .",
    "we have used our data to construct period - luminosity relations in the v and i bands which are of very good quality . adopting a period - cutoff of log p(days ) = 0.75 , and the slopes of the lmc cepheid pl relations in v and i measured by udalski ( 2000 )",
    ", we obtain a reddening - corrected distance modulus of 25.54 @xmath0 0.05 mag ( statistical error ) to ngc 3109 , which is in good agreement with previous distance results from optical work on smaller cepheid samples in this galaxy , and with determinations of the i - band magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch . as in the former papers of the araucaria project ,",
    "this distance is tied to an assumed lmc distance modulus of 18.50 .",
    "we are currently engaged in analyzing a subsample of the cepheids in ngc 3109 at near - infrared ( j and k ) wavelengths . with the advent of pl relations in j and k",
    ", we expect to improve on the accuracy of our current , optical distance determination , mainly by improving on the value of the total reddening appropriate to ngc 3109 , and to achieve a distance determination whose accuracy is comparable to our previous work on ngc 300 ( gieren et al .",
