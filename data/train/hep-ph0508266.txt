    "one of the most promising solutions to the hierarchy problem is the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model @xcite . in this model",
    "there is a single extra dimension compactified on @xmath1 with the non - factorizable metric of @xmath2 @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the extra - dimensional coordinate , and @xmath5 is the inverse of the @xmath6 curvature , @xmath7 .",
    "two branes define the boundaries of the extra dimension .",
    "one , at @xmath8 , is called the uv , or planck , brane .",
    "the other , at @xmath9 , is the ir , or tev , brane . picking @xmath10 , which is natural in realistic stabilization mechanisms ,",
    "solves the hierarchy problem @xcite .    in the original rs model",
    "the sm was confined to the ir brane , and only gravity propagated in the bulk @xcite .",
    "it has since been realized that both gauge and fermion fields can live in the bulk in a realistic model @xcite .",
    "these models are realistic , but the parameter space can be strongly reduced by precision electroweak constraints .",
    "much of this problem can be traced to the fact that the massive gauge fields receive a contribution to their mass from the bulk geometry which does not respect the custodial @xmath11 .",
    "this can be fixed by expanding the gauge group to @xmath12 , which dramatically improves the electroweak fit @xcite .",
    "the breaking of this extended electroweak symmetry proceeds in two stages : on the uv brane @xmath13 ; on the ir brane @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the diagonal of the @xmath16 groups .",
    "this paper investigates the properties of the higgs sector that accomplishes this breaking .",
    "we now ask what drives the breaking on each brane . on the planck brane",
    "all degrees of freedom will have planck scale masses , so we can ignore them .",
    "we can then implement the breaking with boundary conditions to good approximation .",
    "this leads to the boundary conditions at @xmath8 @xmath17 here @xmath18 and @xmath19 are ratios of 5d gauge couplings : @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .    on the tev brane",
    ", the masses will be tev scale , so we should look at the higgs sector in detail . the simplest structure that will create",
    "the breaking pattern is a real higgs that is a bidoublet under @xmath22 .",
    "this leads to the boundary conditions at @xmath9 @xmath23 note that in the @xmath24 limit we obtain the usual higgsless boundary conditions , and this model reduces to the higgsless model in @xcite",
    ". we will use this parameter , @xmath25 to interpolate between the sm limit ( @xmath26 ) , and the higgsless limit .",
    "[ fig : wroot ]    to write down the effective 4d theory , we expand the 5d fields into kaluza klein ( kk ) fields , @xmath27 we can now obtain the gauge boson wavefunctions by solving the equation of motion subject to the boundary conditions ( [ eq : gaugebcr ] ) and ( [ eq : gaugebcrp ] ) .",
    "this produces a spectrum of eigenvalues corresponding to the excitations of the gauge fields .",
    "the lowest masses in each of the charged and neutral sectors will correspond to the @xmath28 and @xmath29 bosons .",
    "the neutral sector also contains a zero mode , corresponding to the photon .",
    "fig [ fig : wroot ] shows the eigenvalue for the @xmath28 as a function of the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "[ fig : wcoup ]",
    "one interesting feature of this model is that the @xmath28 and @xmath29 wavefunctions are suppressed near the ir brane , as can be seen by inspecting the boundary conditions",
    ". this suppression increases for increasing @xmath25 .",
    "this means that the coupling of massive gauge bosons to the higgs will generically be suppressed .",
    "[ fig : wcoup ] shows the coupling of the @xmath28 to the higgs . for values of @xmath25 near unity",
    "the lep bounds on the higgs mass can be dramatically reduced .",
    "( for larger values of @xmath25 the model is effectively higgsless . )",
    "the fermion sector of this model is more complicated .",
    "again , the higgs vev induces mixed boundary conditions that link left and right handed fields to give the fermions masses .",
    "however , there are two new degrees of freedom . first",
    ", since 5d fermions are achiral , ther can always be a mass term in the bulk @xmath30 .",
    "the main effect of this term is to shift the location of the fermion zero mode in the bulk . by changing this parameter",
    "we can cause the zero mode to be localized either near the uv or ir brane , and also can change the degree of this localization .",
    "this allows us to control the overlap of the zero mode with the ir brane , and consequently the strength with which the fermion interacts with the higgs . in this way",
    "the hierarchy of fermion masses can be generated by order one changes in the 5d masses .",
    "the second complication arises from the @xmath31 symmetry which enforces that , for example , @xmath32 if unbroken .",
    "this mass relation can be modified by mixing with new fermions localized to the planck brane , where the @xmath31 is broken . for full details , see @xcite .    note that there are tree - level corrections to precision electroweak observables , coming largely from the kk excitations of the gauge bosons .",
    "unfortunately , the magnitude of these corrections is highly sensitive to the configuration of the fermion sector . for the specific configuration studied in @xcite",
    "we find the constraint @xmath33 .",
    "there are , however , special points in the fermion parameter space where the constraint becomes trivial , so a wide range of @xmath25 should be considered .",
    "the final interesting shift in higgs properties is in the couplings to massless gauge bosons , _",
    "i.e. _ gluons and photons .",
    "the coupling of the higgs to gluon pairs is induced through top loops . however , in this model the kk excitations also couple to the higgs .",
    "furthermore , note that we have arranged small 4d yukawa couplings for the other fermions by small wavefunction overlaps with the would - be zero modes .",
    "the 5d yukawa couplings are all order 1 , and the excited states have _ no _ wavefunction suppression .",
    "hence there are large contributions to the higgs - glue - glue coupling from the kk excitations of _ all _ colored fermions .",
    "this leads to an enhancement in that coupling , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hgg ] .",
    "there are similar corrections to the higgs - gamma - gamma coupling .",
    "the situation there is more complicated , however , since there are also contributions from @xmath28 boson loops , which are dominant in the sm , and the higgs coupling to @xmath28s is suppressed .",
    "we can now look at the behavior of the higgs branching ratios , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : widthbr ] . note in particular the dominance of @xmath34 over a wide range , and the late onset of @xmath35 .",
    "this is driven by the @xmath31 symmetry , which gives a large enhancement of the @xmath36-quark yukawa , and the suppression of the gauge boson couplings .",
    "note also the reduction in the @xmath37 mode .",
    "this will make discovery at the lhc difficult .",
    "the suppression of the coupling to gauge bosons also means that production at the ilc will be reduced , making this higgs a particularly difficult one to find .",
    "however , it will be essential to measure the higgs couplings with precision to identify a warped extra dimension as the correct theory of new physics , if indeed this is what is realized in nature .",
