    "the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos - n ) at the gemini north 8-meter telescope was commissioned in august and september 2001 , and has been in regular operation since october 2001 .",
    "gmos - n is used in imaging mode for imaging of fields later to be observed in multi - object spectroscopic mode as well as for imaging programs aimed at photometry of faint targets .",
    "gmos - n is equipped with a filter set ( @xmath3 ) intended to be identical to the sloan - digital - sky - survey ( sdss ) filters .",
    "the sdss @xmath3 standard star system is described in smith et al .",
    "filters designed to reproduce the sdss system have also been used at the isaac newton telescope , in particular for the wide field survey carried out with this telescope , see lewis et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for details .",
    "photometric standard star fields were observed with gmos - n during each photometric night when imaging data were obtained for commissioning , system verification and/or queue programs . using all of these observations together",
    "offer the possibility of determining the photometric calibration to an accuracy not possible from the photometric standard stars usually made available to individual investigators .",
    "long - term monitoring of the system performance ( telescope plus instrument ) is possible , as well as testing for systematic effects in the calibrations .",
    "since all gemini data are archived , the calibrations derived in this paper will also be of importance to future archive users .",
    "this paper presents the photometric zero points for all photometric nights during which photometric standard stars were observed , an accurate determination of the color terms , and tests for systematic effects in the calibrations .",
    "the intent is to calibrate the gmos - n photometric system to consistency with the sdss system . as for the sdss system ,",
    "the calibrated magnitudes are very close to ab magnitudes .",
    "gmos - n and the commissioning of the instrument are described in detail in hook et al .",
    "gmos - s on gemini south is similar to gmos - n .",
    "however , the calibrations and color terms are expected to be different for the two instruments primarily due to differences in the detector quantum efficiencies .",
    "see ryder , murrowood & stathakis ( 2006 ) for examples of photometric calibrations for gmos - s .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the available data , the observed fields , the basic reductions , and how the photometry is derived .",
    "section 3 compares the gmos - n system throughput with the sdss system and describes the transformation of the landolt ( 1992 ) standard magnitudes to the sdss system . in section 4",
    "we derive the nightly zero points and discuss the variations of these with time .",
    "the color terms in the transformations are established in section 5 , while section 6 presents other tests for systematic effects .",
    "the results are summarized in section 7 .",
    "we have used all observations of photometric standard star fields obtained with gmos - n between ut 2001 august 20 and ut 2003 december 26 .",
    "the photometric standard star fields were chosen from landolt ( 1992 ) , except the field gj745a+b observed in november 2003 which is from smith et al .",
    "while in retrospect it might have been better to select sdss standard stars from smith et al .  as standard stars for gmos - n ,",
    "no information was publicly available on the sdss magnitudes of these stars at the time when gmos - n started operations .",
    "table [ tab - gmosstdstars ] lists the names of the fields and the central coordinates .",
    "there are eleven standard star fields normally used for gmos - n , listed as `` standard field '' in table [ tab - gmosstdstars ] .",
    "in addition the table contains 15 fields that were only observed during november 2003 .",
    "these fields contain red standard stars , most of them with @xmath4 .",
    "they were observed in order to establish the color terms for especially the @xmath5-filter and the @xmath1-filter in the far red .",
    "these fields are listed as `` red star '' in table [ tab - gmosstdstars ] . during november 2003 ,",

    "the normal standard star fields , as well as the field 98_618 contain between three and ten standard stars .",
    "the other fields observed in november 2003 contain only one or two stars .",
    "observations were done during 117 nights .",
    "these nights were either commissioning nights or queue science nights .",
    "usually the staff observer only obtained standard star observations if the night was judged to be photometric based on the counts from the guide - probes on gemini north and/or the information from the canada - france - hawaii - telescope ( cfht ) skyprobe ( http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/instruments/elixir/skyprobe/ + tonight.html ) .",
    "the photometric quality of the nights were checked after the fact as well using archived data from these sources .",
    "data taken during non - photometric nights were excluded from the analysis .",
    "a total of 1694 images were obtained during photometric nights , 282 of those during the november 2003 observations .",
    "ninety different stars were observed , 66 of these are in the normal standard star fields , while the remainder were only observed during november 2003 .",
    "thirteen of the stars observed are included in smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) as primary standards for the sdss system , six of these were only observed during november 2003 .",
    "observations were done in @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath5 , and @xmath1 though not all filters were used each night . on seven nights also @xmath8 observations were obtained .",
    "the typical exposure times were 1 or 3 seconds for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath5 and @xmath1 , and 20 sec for @xmath8 .",
    "the gmos - n shutter is a blade shutter .",
    "the travel time for the shutter blades depends slightly on the direction of movement , causing @xmath2 1 percent uncertainty on the exposure time of 1 sec exposures . using the average of two exposures taken immediately after each other instead of a single exposure eliminates this uncertainty .",
    "thus , all the standard star observations were taken as pairs of two exposures .",
    "a custom program was written to automatically select the photometric standard star observations from all observations obtained with gmos - n , and then select the mean bias image and twilight flat field closest in time to each standard star observation .",
    "the images were then processed using the gmos tasks in the gemini iraf package ; v1.5 of the package was used .",
    "the gemini iraf package is an external iraf package distributed by gemini observatory .",
    "the images were bias subtracted , converted from adu to electrons , and flat field corrected .",
    "bias images and flat fields were the mean images derived for each dark - period and are identical to those reduced calibration images distributed to the users with programs observed during queue operation of the instrument .",
    "finally the images from the three detectors were mosaiced together to one image .    using the world - coordinate - system in the images together with",
    "improved coordinates for the landolt standard stars provided by john thorstensen ( private communication , 2003 ) , pixel coordinate files for all images were produced automatically .",
    "the coordinates from thorstensen were derived using the usno a2.0 catalog ( monet et al .",
    "1996 ) as well as the carlsberg meridian circle cmc12 catalog ( evans , irwin & helmer 2002 ) .",
    "the cmc12 positions have external accuracies of @xmath9 mas and an epoch near 2000 ; the usno a2.0 positions are generally accurate to @xmath10 mas and are from the poss - i , taken in the 1950s . known high - proper - motion stars not in cmc12",
    "were updated manually to epoch 2000 .",
    "a few landolt stars missing in thorstensen s list , were added manually using the usno a2.0 catalog . for other users ,",
    "the improved coordinates are distributed as part of gemini iraf package ( v1.5 and later ) in the table gmos$calib / nlandolt.fits .",
    "the reduced images were processed with the task gemseeing , which is part of the gemini iraf package , in order to determine the full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) and ellipticity of the point - spread - function ( psf ) .",
    "only the standard stars in each field were used for this purpose .",
    "saturated stars were eliminated from the measurements .",
    "images with very poor image quality were omitted from further analysis .",
    "the poor image quality is due to the fact that majority of the standard star observations were done without guiding .",
    "when observing without guiding , the gemini telescopes are subject to wind shake , which on occasion can cause very poor image quality even in exposures with exposure time below 5 seconds .",
    "= 16.5 cm    = 16.5 cm      for each image the median values of the fwhm and the ellipticity , @xmath11 , were used to determine the aperture size to be used for the photometry .",
    "the aperture radius for each image was derived as @xmath12 for a moffat psf with @xmath13 , as is typical for gmos - n images , less than 0.7 per cent of the signal is expected to be outside this aperture size .",
    "thus , no aperture corrections were applied to the photometry .",
    "see trujillo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for a graphical comparison of gaussian and moffat profiles . in the limit of @xmath14",
    "the moffat profile is identical to a gaussian profile .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were then derived as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the exposure time , @xmath17 is the number of electrons inside the aperture and above the sky level , @xmath18 is the mean airmass for the exposure , and @xmath19 is the median atmospheric extinction at mauna kea .",
    "the adopted median atmospheric extinction is 0.42 , 0.14 , 0.11 , 0.10 and 0.05 for @xmath8 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath5 , and @xmath1 , respectively ( bland , boulade & davidge 1988 ) .",
    "the sdss primary standards were observed with the usno 40-inch telescope , flagstaff , arizona ( smith et al .",

    "we compare the available throughput information for that system with the throughput of the gemini north 8-meter telescope plus gmos - n .",

    "the data for the usno 40-inch are from the web site http://home.fnal.gov/@xmath20dtucker/ugriz/filters/response.html , while the data for gemini are available on the gmos - n web pages ( linked from http://www.gemini.edu ) .",
    "the transmission curves for the filters used in gmos - n appear to be shifted slightly redwards relative to those of the filters used at the unso 40-inch .",
    "further , gmos - n has relatively better throughput in the red and poorer throughput in the blue , compared to the usno 40-inch .",
    "this is most likely due to a difference in quantum efficiency for the ccds in the two systems .",

    "the star sa98_614 was excluded from further analysis because it has a faint neighbor inside the aperture used for the photometry .",
    "further , only stars with @xmath32 were included in the determination of the nightly magnitude zero points for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath5 , and @xmath1 , while for @xmath8 the stars were also required to have @xmath33 .",
    "this is done to limit the effect of the color terms on the zero points , see section 5 . for objects with colors outside",

    "information from fan ( 1999 ) and adelman - mccarthy et al.(2008 ) shows that the `` lower '' of the two sequences on this diagram is formed by low mass main sequence stars , while the `` upper '' sequence contains cool subdwarfs and possibly carbon stars .",

    "the mirror washes and the secondary mirror recoating are marked on figure [ fig - gmoszero ] .",
    "the large decline in system throughput from august 2001 to february 2002 is most likely due to a degradation of the coating of the secondary mirror .",
    "while no reflectivity measurements for the secondary mirror are available from this period , it is clear that the primary mirror reflectivity did not decline sufficiently to explain this decline in system throughput .",
    "further , the system throughput was restored to the original values after the recoating of the secondary mirror on ut 2003 january 10 .",
    "= 16.5 cm    smaller variations in the zero points are most likely due to night - to - night variations in the atmospheric extinction . to quantify these variations , we fitted linear functions to the nightly zero points for the @xmath7 filter as a function of the number of days after ut 2001 august 1 .",

    "<S> all available observations of photometric standard stars obtained with the gemini multi - object spectrograph at gemini north in the period from august 2001 to december 2003 have been used to establish the calibrations for photometry obtained with the instrument . </S>",
    "<S> the calibrations presented in this paper are based on significantly more photometric standard star observations than usually used by the individual users . </S>",
    "<S> nightly photometric zero points as well as color terms are determined . </S>",
    "<S> the color terms are expected to be valid for all observations taken prior to ut 2004 november 21 at which time the gemini north primary mirror was coated with silver instead of aluminum . while the nightly zero points are accurate to 0.02 mag or better ( random errors ) , the accuracy of the calibrations is limited by systematic errors from so - called `` sky concentration '' , an effect seen in all focal reducer instruments . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that an accuracy of 0.035 to 0.05 mag can be achieved by using calibrations derived in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the color terms are strongest for very red objects , e.g.  for objects with @xmath0 the resulting @xmath1 magnitudes will be @xmath2 0.35 mag too bright if the color term is ignored . </S>",
    "<S> the calibrations are of importance to the large gemini user community with data obtained prior to ut 2004 november 21 , as well as future users of achive data from this period in time . </S>"
