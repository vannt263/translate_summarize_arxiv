    "the cold dark matter plus cosmological constant model ( @xmath0cdm ) appears to be remarkably successful in describing cosmology on scales much larger than a mpc ( e.g. bahcall , ostriker , perlmutter & steinhardt 1999 ) .",

    "we are interested in the statistics of multiple imaging due to a generalized nfw profile ( zhao 1996 ) which may be used to describe both cdm and sidm halos .",
    "we concentrate our efforts on lensing by clusters of galaxies , since single galaxies contain a significant mass in baryons , distributed to produce a flat rotation curve .",
    "this makes sidm in galaxies difficult to probe using gravitational lensing .",

    "minimization of @xmath139 produces halo fits with similar average absolute relative differences to @xmath136 . finally , minimizing @xmath140 ( lower panels ) obtains good fits beyond @xmath141 at the expense of an incorrect central density .",

    "the dot - dashed lines in the upper , central and lower plots of fig .  [ fitprofb ] are depictions of the @xmath115 degeneracies corresponding to the minimization quantities @xmath136 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "since @xmath136 produces good fits to the core region , which is known to be most important for strong lensing ( e.g. turner , ostriker & gott 1984 ) , the lines of degeneracy are nearly parallel to those describing the cross - section to multiple imaging over much of the parameter space .",
    "however for combinations of low or high concentration and low inner slope , the approximately degenerate profiles do not provide a accurate description of the lensing statistics .",
    "minimization of @xmath139 results in profile degeneracies similar to those for strong lensing unless the profile has large @xmath23 and small @xmath22 .",
    "finally , minimization of @xmath140 leads to degeneracies that differ significantly from those for strong lensing .",
    "fits that are weighted towards the central regions , and which result in highly concentrated profiles may therefore be converted to the analytically treatable nfw ( @xmath41 ) profile while approximately preserving the lensing statistics .",
    "this is particularly true for fits based on minimization of @xmath139 . on the other hand , lensing calculations based on profiles which best describe the density over the largest volume ( out to @xmath142 ) may severely under or over - estimate the strong lensing statistics .",
    "for example , zhao halos having the same @xmath18 , but different parameters ( @xmath143 ) = ( 1.5,6.0 ) and ( 1.0,10.0 ) are degenerate to fitting by the minimization of @xmath140 , but differ in @xmath67 by an order of magnitude . thus fig .",

    "statistics generated from surveys for gravitational lenses are subject to several classes of bias . kockanek ( 1991 )",
    "has given a detailed discussion of selection biases in optical , imaging , galaxy mass gravitational lens surveys .",
    "two primary sources of bias against finding a lens are selection against small separations due to the finite angular resolution of the survey , and the obscuration or differential reddening of one or both images due to dust in the lens galaxy .",
    "when considering lensing by clusters , the splittings are nearly always larger than the survey resolution . in addition , the lensed images are viewed through the halo rather than the outskirts of a galaxy .",
    "these biases should not therefore operate on any significant level in the analysis of cluster lensing statistics .",
    "the magnification of a lensed image has the potential to boost the observed flux of a source which is intrinsically faint above the survey detection limit .",
    "lensed images therefore sample fainter members of the source population .",
    "this is magnification bias ( gott & gunn 1974 ; turner 1980 ) , and it a significant factor in any lens survey .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ results ] , lenses with low concentration and a shallow cusp result in a low cross - section .",
    "very close alignment is therefore required to produce multiple imaging , and this results in a high minimum magnification .",
    "more concentrated lenses do not require such high alignment to produce multiple imaging , thus the cross section is larger , and the minimum magnification not so high . in the latter case",
    ", although the mean is lower , high magnifications are still present where the alignment is high . as a result ,",
    "the mean magnification is not necessarily a fair indication of the magnification bias .",
    "magnification bias operates differently in surveys for galaxy and cluster lenses .",
    "the typical separation of a galaxy lens is smaller than most optical survey resolution limits , and the total magnification must be used to compute the magnification bias . however , the total magnification is not the important quantity for cluster lensing surveys since the separate images are generally resolved ( see also chiba & yoshii 1997 ) .",
    "there are different approaches to making a wide separation gravitational lens survey .",
    "firstly , candidate lenses may be selected from galaxy or cluster catalogues having one image of a source in good alignment with a potential lens .",
    "follow up imaging can then be used to look for a second , fainter image .",
    "this is the approach taken by systematic surveys to date ( e.g. maoz et al .",
    "1997 ; phillips , browne & wilkinson 2000 ) . here",
    "the magnification bias which results in the inclusion of the brighter image into the initial survey is important ( though the overall bias for the survey must also consider the detectability of the faint image in follow up observations ) .",
    "a second method looks for pairs of lensed images in existing data . in this instance , the magnification bias which also includes the fainter image ( the second brightest for three image lenses , i.e. image 3 ) , and thus both images into the survey is the relevant quantity .    to compute magnification bias , a number magnitude relation for the sources is required .",

    "<S> strong lensing is a powerful probe of the distribution of matter in the cores of clusters of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies suggest that the cold dark matter model predicts cores that are denser than those observed in galaxies , groups and clusters </S>",
    "<S> . one possible resolution of the discrepancy is that the dark matter has strong interactions ( sidm ) , which leads to lower central densities . </S>",
    "<S> a generalized form of the navarro , frenk and white profile ( zhao profile ) may be used to describe these halos . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we examine gravitational lensing statistics for this class of model .    </S>",
    "<S> the optical depth to multiple imaging is a very sensitive function of the profile parameters in the range of interest for sidm halos around clusters of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> less concentrated profiles , which result from larger self - interaction cross - sections , can produce many fewer lensed pairs . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , profiles that result in a small optical depth exhibit reduced typical splittings , but produce multiple images that are more highly magnified . </S>",
    "<S> however the resulting increased magnification bias does not alter our conclusions .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that lensing statistics based on profile parameters obtained from fits out to the virial radius are dependent on the minimization scheme adopted , and may be seriously in error . </S>",
    "<S> however , profile fits weighted towards the core region have parameter degeneracies that are approximately equivalent to those for strong lensing cross - sections .    </S>",
    "<S> lensing statistics provide a powerful test for sidm . </S>",
    "<S> more realistic and observationally oriented calculations remain to be done , however larger self - interaction cross - sections may well be ruled out by the very existence of strong lenses on galaxy cluster scales . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of centrally dominant cluster galaxies should boost the cross - section to multiple imaging . </S>",
    "<S> however our preliminary calculations suggest that the additional multiple imaging rate is small with respect to the differences in multiple imaging rate for different halo profiles . in future statistical studies </S>",
    "<S> , it will be important to properly account for the scatter among halo profiles since the optical depth to multiple imaging is dominated by the most concentrated members of a cluster population . </S>"
