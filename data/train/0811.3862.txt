    "studies of the single - spin asymmetries ( ssa s ) is a sensitive tool to probe qcd at small and large distances .",
    "experimentally , significant ssa s were observed in various processes of elastic scattering , inclusive and exclusive hadron production .    _ the processes of hadron interactions _ are complicated , there is no proof of factorization theorem for these processes and it could results from the real absence of hard and soft parts of interaction factorization in hadronic reactions .",
    "the origin of ssa in these reactions is not clear . despite significant efforts in theoretical studies devoted to this problem ,",
    "the phenomenological success is rather limited ; at the moment there is no comprehensive approach able to describe the existing set of experimental data on polarization , asymmetries , spin correlations and the unpolarized cross - sections .",
    "theoretically , there are various approaches to generation of the nonzero ssa but prevailing number of studies of the ssa s in the field are based on _ assumed _ extended factorization in perturbative qcd with considerations of the sivers ( structure functions ) and/or collins ( fragmentation functions ) mechanisms @xcite combined sometime with inclusion of the higher twists contributions to the scattering amplitude of the seemingly to be hard parton subprocess @xcite .    _ the decreasing dependence of ssa with @xmath0 _  common feature for the listed above approaches  has not been observed experimentally .",
    "the experimental data including the most recent data obtained at rhic @xcite , are consistent with a flat transverse momentum dependence at @xmath1 gev / c . another important point is related to the unpolarized inclusive cross - section . for example",
    ", it has also been demonstrated @xcite that the description of the inclusive cross - section for @xmath2-production , at the energies lower than the rhic energies also meets difficulties in the framework of the perturbative qcd .",
    "deviation from the pqcd scaling is mostly noticeable in the forward region where the most significant asymmetry in the @xmath2 production in @xmath3 has also been observed by star collaboration at rhic @xcite at @xmath4 gev ( in the fragmentation region of the polarized proton ) .",
    "of course , more experimental data are needed to perform a conclusive test of various theoretical approaches and their predictions should be more specified and elaborated for the observables at the hadronic level . in this connection",
    "it should be noted that one of the most interesting and persistent spin phenomenon is a very significant polarization of @xmath5hyperons which has been discovered almost three decades ago in collisions of unpolarized hadron beams @xcite . it should be also noted , that the asymmetry @xmath6 in the neutral pion production in the backward and midrapidity regions @xcite .",
    "ssa has also zero value in the @xmath7 , while @xmath8 in the @xmath9 @xcite in the polarized proton fragmentation region .",
    "the approaches based on the assumed pqcd factorization meet in these processes the problems mentioned above .",
    "thus , it is ( more or less depending on the particular personal taste ) evident that the problems mentioned above can be related to the illegitimate use of the methods based on perturbative expansion , factorization and accounts for higher twists in the region and in the processes where they actually can not be valid , and it is the kinematical region of the modern experiments dealing with rather modest transverse momenta and energies .",
    "in contrast , it might happen that ssa s originate from the genuine nonperturbative sector of qcd ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such point of view , i.e. that the polarization has its roots in the nonperturbative sector of qcd was widely used in the earlier models and becomes less isolated one nowadays .",
    "_ in the nonperturbative sector of qcd _ the two phenomena , confinement and chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking ( @xmath10sb)@xcite should be reproduced .",
    "the relevant scales are characterized by the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "chiral @xmath13 symmetry is spontaneously broken at the distances between these two scales .",
    "the @xmath10sb leads to generation of quark masses and appearance of quark condensates .",
    "it describes transition of current into constituent quarks .",
    "constituent quarks in its turn are quasiparticles , i.e. they are a coherent superposition of bare quarks and their masses are comparable to a hadron mass scale .",
    "therefore hadron is often represented as a loosely bounded system of the constituent quarks .",
    "these observations on the hadron structure lead to understanding of several regularities observed in hadron interactions at large distances .",
    "it is well known that such picture provides reasonable values for the static characteristics of hadrons , for instance , their magnetic moments .",
    "the other well known result is appearance of the goldstone bosons .",
    "it has been successfully applied for the explanation of the nucleon spin structure @xcite including the most recent results obtained at jlab @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to note that the _ structure functions _ are represented by the distorted parton distributions in the impact parameter plane in the polarized case @xcite . in this work",
    "the approach based on nonperturbative qcd has been used to relate @xmath5-polarization with large magnitude of the transverse flavor dipole moment of the transversely polarized baryons .",
    "the instanton  induced ssa generation @xcite relates those asymmetries to a genuine nonperturbative qcd interaction .",
    "it should be noted that the physics of instantons ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) can provide microscopic explanation for the @xmath10sb .",
    "we discuss here the ssa generation based on chiral quark model ideas ( cf . e.g. @xcite ) and the filtering spin states related to the account of unitarity in the @xmath14-channel .",
    "it connects polarization with asymmetry in the position ( impact parameter ) space .",
    "we show that the common features of ssa measurements at rhic and tevatron ( linear increase of asymmetry with @xmath15 and flat transverse momentum dependence at @xmath16 gev / c ) can be reproduced and described in the framework of the semiclassical picture based on the further development of the chiral quark model suggested in @xcite and results of its adaptation for the treatment of the polarized and unpolarized inclusive cross - sections .",
    "the above mentioned data obtained at rhic @xcite for the unpolarized inclusive cross - section can be simultaneously described .",
    "consistency with other new experimental regularities found at rhic are discussed as well .",
    "as it was argued the ssa could originate from the nonperturbative qcd and is related to the mechanism of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath10sb ) in qcd @xcite , leading to generation of quark masses and appearance of quark condensates .",
    "thus we consider a hadron as an extended object consisting of the valence constituent quarks located in the central core which is embedded into a quark condensate .",
    "collective excitations of the condensate are the goldstone bosons and the constituent quarks interact via exchange of goldstone bosons @xcite .",
    "this interaction is mainly due to a pion field and has therefore a spin  flip nature .    at the first stage of hadron interaction",
    "common effective self - consistent field appears .",
    "this field is generated by @xmath17 pairs and pions interacting with quarks .",
    "the time of generation of the effective field @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total interaction time .",
    "this assumption on the almost instantaneous generation of the effective field obtained some support in the very short thermalization time revealed in heavy - ion collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "valence constituent quarks are scattered simultaneously ( due to strong coupling with goldstone bosons ) and in a quasi - independent way by this effective strong field .",
    "such ideas were used in the model @xcite which has been applied to description of elastic scattering and hadron production @xcite .    in the initial state of the reaction @xmath21 the proton is polarized and can be represented in the simple su(6 ) model as following : @xmath22 we exploit the common feature of chiral quark models ; namely the constituent quark @xmath23 with transverse spin in up - direction can fluctuate into goldstone boson and another constituent quark @xmath24 with opposite spin direction , i. e. perform a spin - flip transition @xcite : @xmath25    the @xmath2-fluctuations of quarks do not change the quark flavor and assuming they have equal probabilities in the processes : @xmath26 the production of @xmath2 by the polarized proton @xmath27 in this simple @xmath28 picture can be regarded as a result of the fluctuation of the constituent quark @xmath23 ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) in the effective field into the system @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "the contributions to the cross - sections difference of the quarks polarized in opposite directions compensate each other ( as it will be clear in what follows ) , and it is not the case for the @xmath2-production in the unpolarized case .",
    "therefore the asymmetry @xmath32 should obey the inequality @xmath33 .    to compensate quark spin flip @xmath34",
    ", an orbital angular momentum @xmath35 should be attributed to the final state of reaction ( [ trans ] ) .",
    "the presence of @xmath36 in its turn means a shift in the impact parameter value of the goldstone boson @xmath2 : @xmath37 due to different strengths of interaction at the different impact distances , i.e. @xmath38 the processes of transition @xmath23 and @xmath39 to @xmath2 will have different probabilities .",
    "it eventually leads to nonzero asymmetry @xmath40 .",
    "( [ spinflip ] ) clarify mechanism of the ssa generation : when shift in impact parameter is @xmath41 the interaction is stronger than when the shift is @xmath42 , and the asymmetry @xmath40 is positive .",
    "it is important to note here that the shift in @xmath43 ( the impact parameter of final pion ) is equivalent to the shift of the impact parameter of the initial proton according to the relation between impact parameters in the multiparticle production@xcite : @xmath44 the variable @xmath45 is conjugated to the transverse momentum of @xmath2 , but relations between functions depending on the impact parameters @xmath46 , which will be used further for the calculation of asymmetry , are nonlinear and therefore we are using the semiclassical correspondence between small and large values of transverse momentum and impact parameter : @xmath47    we consider production of @xmath2 in the fragmentation region , i.e. at large @xmath15 and therefore use the approximate relation @xmath48 which results from eq .",

    "those dependencies are valid in high - energy approximation and therefore have been compared with fnal and rhic data only . nevertheless , they are in a qualitative agreement with the lower energy data also @xcite .    comparison with experimental data allows to estimate the value @xmath102 fm .",
    "similar mechanism should generate ssa in the production of charged pions .",
    "the relevant process for @xmath103production in polarized @xmath104 interactions @xmath105 leads to a negative shift in the impact parameter and consequently to the positive asymmetry @xmath32 , while the corresponding process for the @xmath106production @xmath107 leads to the positive shift in impact parameter and , respectively , to the negative asymmetry @xmath32 .",
    "asymmetry @xmath32 in the @xmath108-production in the fragmentation region of polarized proton should have linear @xmath15dependence at @xmath109 and flat @xmath0 dependence at large @xmath110 .",
    "those dependencies are similar to the ones depicted on fig . 2 for @xmath2production .",
    "it should be noted that at large transverse momenta asymmetries are energy - independent at high energies .",
    "choosing the region of small @xmath0 we select then the large values of impact parameter and obtain @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the hadron interaction radius , which serve as a scale separating large and small impact parameter regions",
    "( [ pollsm ] ) does not allow to draw a definite conclusion on asymmetry behaviour .",
    "its dependence relies on the unknown function @xmath113 .",
    "nevertheless , it would be interesting to have at least qualitative estimates of the size of single - spin asymmetries in the small momentum transferred region .",
    "it should be noted in this connection , that this region includes the interactions at the boundary of the effective field localization domain ( cf .",
    "[ ts2 ] ) .    therefore , in principle , the asymmetry , which is determined by the variation @xmath114 , could have significant values due to a large gradient of the interaction intensity in the boundary region .",
    "thus , at the values of transverse momenta corresponding to the constituent quark transition one can observe very significant asymmetries as it really happens in the forward neutron production at rhic ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , we can not provide the quantitative estimates of the intensity interaction gradient .",
    "we can just point out to the possibility , that the similar phenomena should takes place in other reactions such as polarization of @xmath5-hyperons and it would be important therefore to scan experimentally the region of small transverse momenta in the forward production by measurements in narrow bins of transverse momentum",
    ". it should be noted in this connection that the chiral quark fluctuation in the effective field with spin flip is relatively suppressed when compared to direct elastic scattering of quarks and therefore does not play a role e.g. in the reaction @xmath7 in the fragmentation region , but it should not be suppressed in @xmath9 .",
    "these features really can be observed experimentally : asymmetry @xmath32 is consistent with zero for proton production and significantly deviates from zero for neutron production in the forward region .    to underline the model self - consistency",
    "we will demonstrate that it is able to describe the unpolarized cross - section of @xmath2-production also ( section 5 ) .",
    "chiral quark spin filtering can be used for the explanation of the hyperon polarization @xcite .",
    "note that polarization of @xmath5  hyperon has the same generic dependence on @xmath15 and @xmath0 as the asymmetries in the pion production . in this section we consider the origin of the hyperon polarization in the processes where particle in the initial state are unpolarized .",
    "experimentally the process of @xmath5-production has been studied more extensively than other hyperon production processes . observed pattern of hyperon polarization is well known and being stable for a long time - hyperons produced in the unpolarized inclusive @xmath49interactions is negative and energy independent , it increases linearly with @xmath15 at large transverse momenta ( @xmath1 gev / c ) , and for such values of transverse momenta is almost @xmath0-independent @xcite . ] .",
    "the main idea is the filtering or discrimination between the two initial spin states of equal probability due to different strength of interactions in the course of scattering in the effective field .",
    "the description of spin filtering is considered on the basis of chiral quark model , formulas for inclusive cross section ( with account for the unitarity ) @xcite and notion on the quasi - independent nature of valence quark scattering in the effective field .",
    "we will use the already discussed feature of chiral quark model that constituent quark @xmath23 with transverse spin in up - direction can fluctuate into goldstone boson and another constituent quark @xmath24 with opposite spin direction , i. e. perform a spin - flip transition : @xmath115    to compensate quark spin flip an orbital angular momentum should be generated in final state of reaction ( [ transn ] ) .",
    "the presence of this orbital momentum @xmath36 in its turn means shift in the impact parameter value of the final quark @xmath24 ( which is transmitted to the shift in the impact parameter of @xmath5 ) @xmath37 due to different strengths of interaction at the different values of the impact parameter , the processes of transition to the spin up and down states will have different probabilities which will lead eventually to polarization of @xmath5 .",
    "in a particular case of @xmath5polarization the relevant transitions of constituent quark @xmath62 ( cf . fig .",
    "3 ) will be correlated with the shifts @xmath79 in impact parameter @xmath45 of the final @xmath5-hyperon , i.e. : @xmath116 eqs .",
    "( [ spinflipn ] ) clarify mechanism of the spin states filtering : when shift in impact parameter is @xmath41 the interaction is stronger compared to the case when shift is @xmath42 , and the final @xmath117-quark ( and @xmath5-hyperon ) is polarized negatively .",
    "the shift of @xmath43 ( the impact parameter of final hyperon ) is translated then to the shift of the impact parameter of the initial particles .",
    "the mechanism of the polarization generation is quite natural and it has analogy in optics with the passing of the unpolarized light through the glass of polaroid .",
    "spin states filtering is related to emission of goldstone bosons by constituent quarks .",
    "now we will obtain an expression for the polarization which takes into account unitarity in the direct channel and apply chiral quark filtering to conclude on polarization dependence on kinematical variables .",

    "for example , fig .",
    "5 demonstrates that the linear @xmath15 dependence is in a good agreement with the experimental data in the fragmentation region ( @xmath101 ) where the model should work .",

    "this regime should occur at much higher values of the transverse momenta and energy .",
    "finally , one should note that in the central and backward regions where correlations between impact parameters of the initial and final particles are weak or even completely degraded , the asymmetry can not be generated due to the considered mechanism .",
    "the experimentally observed vanishing asymmetries in the central and backward regions provide indirect evidence in its favor .",
    "we are grateful to c.  aidala , a.  bazilevsky , v.  mochalov , s.  shimanskiy , a.  vasiliev and a.  zelenski for the information and interesting discussions of the experimental data with their phenomenological interpretations .",
