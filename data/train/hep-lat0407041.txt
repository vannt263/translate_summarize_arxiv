    "qcd at finite temperature and quark - number chemical potential , @xmath1 , is of relevance to the physics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "different parts of the phase diagram are accessible to the various heavy - ion accelerators  rhic , cern heavy - ion , ags and sis .    for the region of small @xmath1 and temperatures close to the finite temperature transition , various techniques have been developed to circumvent the problems associated with the complex fermion determinant at finite @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we have chosen to study the finite temperature transition with a finite chemical potential @xmath0 for isospin , which is equivalent to simulating qcd at finite @xmath1 with @xmath2 using only the magnitude of the determinant and ignoring the phase .",
    "because the fermion phase is relatively well behaved at small @xmath1 , it can be argued that the positions of the transitions and probably their nature with and without this phase , should be the same .    for 2 flavours we found no sign of a critical endpoint for @xmath3 , the maximal range",
    "over which finite @xmath0 and finite @xmath1 transitions could be expected to be related @xcite . here",
    "we describe our simulations for 3 flavours . not only is this more physical , but for @xmath4 , the finite temperature transition is first order at @xmath5 . at @xmath6",
    "it becomes second - order , in the ising universality class .",
    "for @xmath7 the @xmath5 transition is a crossover .",
    "it is expected that the critical endpoint moves continuously from @xmath5 for @xmath6 to finite @xmath0 , as @xmath8 is increased .",
    "thus we should be able to keep this endpoint as close to @xmath5 as we please , by choosing @xmath8 to lie just above @xmath9 .",
    "the preliminary results of our simulations at such a mass , reported here , do show such a critical endpoint at a modest value of @xmath0 .    in section  2",
    "we describe our simulations and report preliminary results .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  3 .",
    "the staggered fermion part of our lattice action is @xmath11\\chi                     + i\\lambda\\epsilon\\bar{\\chi}\\tau_2\\chi\\right].\\ ] ] for these simulations , which are at @xmath3 , we set the symmetry breaking parameter @xmath12 .",
    "we are performing simulations on @xmath13 and @xmath14 lattices at @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . [ for @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "] we use standard hybrid molecular - dynamics simulations .",
    "since with such small lattices one can get 2-state signals even for crossovers , we use fourth - order binder cumulants ( @xmath20 ) @xcite for @xmath21 to get quantitative information about the transition : @xmath22 where x is any observable . since we use 5 noise vectors for each configuration to estimate @xmath21 ( and the number densities ) , we are able to obtain an unbiased estimate of @xmath23 , as well as the susceptibility @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 the @xmath26 of the transition is determined by the positions of the maxima of the various susceptibilities , or from the minimum of @xmath23 .",
    "( we have checked the consistency of these two methods . )",
    "figure  [ fig : beta ] shows the transition @xmath26s , @xmath27 , as functions of @xmath0 for the @xmath28 quark masses .",
    "the fits shown are @xmath29 which reflect the expected analyticity in @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath27 was obtained in each case from the position of the minimum of @xmath23 .",
    "ferrenberg - swendsen reweighting was used to interpolate between the @xmath26s of our simulations .",
    "these positions were in good agreement with those obtained from the maxima of the corresponding susceptibilities .    for a lattice of infinite volume ,",
    "the binder cumulant @xmath23 is @xmath28 for a crossover and @xmath31 for a first - order transition .",
    "the critical endpoint is expected to be in the universality class of the 3-d ising model , for which @xmath32 .",
    "while @xmath20 for a crossover or a first - order transition approaches its infinite volume limit relatively slowly with volume , the approach for a second - order phase transition is fast and approaches the limiting value on relatively small lattices @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : binder0.035 ] shows the binder cumulant at the transition for our runs at @xmath33 with @xmath5 and @xmath34 for both @xmath13 and @xmath14 lattices . despite the sizable error bars , these are the results of runs of 160,000 trajectories at the @xmath26 closest to the transition .",
    "@xmath20 at @xmath5 lies above the ising value while that at @xmath34 lies below this value for both lattice sizes .",
    "straight lines through these 2 points for the two lattice sizes cross at some @xmath0 with @xmath35 , and at a @xmath20 value close to the ising value . these preliminary results would indicate that there is a critical endpoint at @xmath36 with @xmath37 .    for the @xmath8 , @xmath0 values at which we have run and for @xmath26s in the neighbourhood of the transition on an @xmath13 lattice we estimate that the phase of the fermion determinant @xmath38 obeys , @xmath39 we have argued in @xcite that @xmath40 is a reasonable estimate of the range over which one can neglect the phase of the fermion determinant in determining the position and nature of the finite temperature transition @xcite .",
    "if so , the finite @xmath0 and @xmath1 behaviour of this transition should agree for @xmath41 , which includes our estimate for the critical endpoint for @xmath33 .",
    "using @xmath42 we then predict that @xmath43",
    "we are simulating 3-flavour lattice qcd at finite @xmath0 and temperatures close to the finite temperature transition .",
    "we observe the slow decrease of @xmath26 and hence temperature , of the finite temperature transition with @xmath0 . arguing that , in this range of @xmath0 , the dependence on @xmath0 and @xmath44 should be the same we find a falloff about 20% slower than that observed by de forcrand and philipsen @xcite at least some of the difference is due to omitting @xmath45 terms .",
    "we have obtained preliminary evidence for a critical endpoint for @xmath33 ( just above @xmath9 ) from simulations at @xmath46 .",
    "however , simulations on an @xmath13 lattice at @xmath47 yield @xmath48 , which does not support this interpretation .",
    "this is probably because @xmath49 is too close to @xmath50 , but this needs to be clarified .",
    "we have seen no evidence for a critical endpoint at @xmath51 . whether this is consistent with what we see at @xmath15 should also be checked .",
    "our prediction for the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath52 appears inconsistent with both de forcrand and philipsen @xcite and the bielefeld - swansea collaboration @xcite , lying in between their inconsistent results .",
    "clearly much more needs to be done .",
    "dks would like to thank philippe de forcrand for helpful discussions on binder cumulants .",
