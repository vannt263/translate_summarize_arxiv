    "every knotted surface is equivalent ( and is placed arbitrarily near ) to a knotted surface whose projection is in a general position .",

    "@xmath23 of a knotted surface @xmath24 is the image @xmath25 with additional information at self crossing , about which sheet was higher before being projected .",
    "we have the following well known characterization of the equivalency between knotted surfaces .",
    "two diagrams represent equivalent linked surfaces if and only if one of them may be achieved from the other by a finite sequence of elementary local moves taken from the list in the figure [ r43 ] ( and some isotopy of the diagram in @xmath14 ) .",
    "r43(11 cm )    for the simplicity , in pictures of those _ rosemann moves _ we do not indicate which sheet is an upper sheet .",
    "let @xmath26 be an oriented linked surface such that the diagram @xmath5 is a @xmath6-diagram .",
    "@xmath27 _ as a set of those circles",
    "@xmath28 , that the set @xmath29 has nonempty intersection with two distinct components of the surface @xmath0 .    on each circle in the set @xmath27",

    "then the _ orientation of the vector @xmath38 _ on @xmath39 is defined through the condition , that a triple @xmath40 matches the orientation given to @xmath14 . by analogy",
    "we can define the orientation of @xmath41 on @xmath42 .",
    "moje3(11 cm )    we will also need to distinguish between two kinds of surface regions .    a set @xmath43 may be _ checkerboard coloured _ ,",
    "i.e. we can colour each component with one of two colours @xmath44 or @xmath45 , such that adjacent ( by common boundary edge ) regions have different colours .",
    "we can deduce from this lemma a usefull fact involving our special set of circles .",
    "a set @xmath46 may be checkerboard coloured , because we can colour one by one regions on each component of @xmath0 , treating them as disjont surface knots .",
    "let us colour then our set @xmath46 in ( one of two ) fixed checkerboard .",
    "finally we will need one more definition to distinguish between two types of elements from the set @xmath27 .",
    "define a set @xmath47 consisting of those circles @xmath48 , that lies on the regions of the colour @xmath45 and lies higher ( with respect to the projection axis ) than its mate circle @xmath49 .",
    "we are now ready to intruduce our mention invariant .",
    "[ tw1 ] a class @xmath50\\in \\mbox{h}_1\\left(f;\\mathbb{z}\\right)\\ ] ] is an invariant of @xmath6-diagrams with respect to the @xmath6-equivalence of the oriented linked surface @xmath0 .",
    "we will proceed by checking all four elementary moves that involve @xmath6-diagrams .    for roseman moves @xmath51 and @xmath52 conclusion of the theorem is satisfied , because both positions and colours of the regions surrounding curves from the set @xmath27 does not change as they projection images do not take part in those moves . in case of the move @xmath53 we are in the situation of appearing and disappearing of a pair of circles on the double decker set .",
    "if those circles do not belong to the set @xmath27 then we give the same argument as in the case of previous moves .",
    "but if those circles belong to the set @xmath27 then because their homology class as @xmath45-chain is zero , our invariant does not change .    more interesting is the last tranformation . in case of the move @xmath54 , presented in figure [ r43 ]",
    "we can notice that all ( involve in this move ) curves from double decker set belong either to circles from the set @xmath27 or the are subsets of circles from outside @xmath27 ( both before and after triansformation ) . if it is the latter case , we give argument as in the move @xmath52 case .",
    "otherwise , we conclude that curves from double decker set ( in this local area that we are going to deform ) which lies `` higher '' with respect to the projection direction lies both on the region with the same colour .",
    "moreover this situation does not change after doing this move .",
    "homology class of @xmath45-chain ( with our defined orientation ) on which corresponding `` lower '' curves lies , does not change ( because of the group additivity ) which ends the proof .",
    "they represent @xmath6-diagrams , because we do not make the reidemeister third move in any transition between stills .",
    "only such elementary move would produce a triple point in the diagram .",
    "our diagrams give rise to knotted surfaces @xmath0 and @xmath55 that are equivalent .",
    "this can be shown for example by applying a combination of another set of moves to the stills .",
    "movie moves _ are described by carter and saito in their book @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath6-diagrams @xmath5 and @xmath9 are not @xmath6-equivalent . from the figure [ moje1 ] of a base surface for @xmath0 with a double decker",
    "set drawn , we can conclude that our invariant for the @xmath5 case gives nontrivial class ( of one of those circles depicted on the torus ) in the oposite to the case of diagram @xmath9 for which the double decker set is empty .",
