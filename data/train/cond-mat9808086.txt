    "about the crucial role of bulk density @xmath13 in the formation of sc properties in the oxide alloys was discussed in refs .",
    "[ 1 - 9 ] .",
    "the bulk density @xmath14 was defined by sintering pressure and by choosing the pressure regime and also by temperature and annealing time of the sintering [ 1 - 4 ] .    at the same time , the decrease of the granule sizes and the increase of the @xmath15 and further saturation was observed when the sintering pressure reaches the limiting value @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the pressing rate is a more critical parameter than the value of sintering pressure in the formation of the sc and structural properties of the obtained samples [ 5 ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite was observed a decrease of the oxidation rate with the increase of density of @xmath16 ceramics which makes it difficult to grow a sample with a higher @xmath8 .",
    "an increase of critical current @xmath17 and magnetic susceptibility@xmath18 in the superconducting state and also a decrease of resistivity of the sample in normal state was observed with increasing of @xmath14 in [ 1,2,7,8 ] . while in ref .",
    "@xcite the samples with higher @xmath14 have lower @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , it was established that the onset temperature @xmath20 of the resistivity appearance increases , and the onset temperature for diamagnetism @xmath21 decreases with the increasing of @xmath14 in y- and bi - based samples @xcite .",
    "note , also that the critical transition temperature @xmath22 in bi - based samples remains unchanged [ 2 ] , although their density @xmath14 varies in a significantly large range . at the same time the critical temperatures , defined by onset , midpoint and offset of sc transition , depending on sintering pressure ( or on density @xmath14 ) , display nonmonotonic behavior @xcite . in @xmath23",
    "samples the hysteresis losses peak @xmath24 temperature @xmath7 and onset temperature of diamagnetism @xmath18 @xmath21 shifts to the lower values with increasing of their @xmath14 [ 8 ] .",
    "it was shown @xcite , that the temperature of complete penetration of high frequency @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 electromagnetic field into sc @xmath28 plates @xmath29 shifts to the lower value region with increasing of @xmath14 , in contrast with [ 8 ] .",
    "thus the analysis of literature data shows that the role of @xmath14 in formation of physical properties of htscs is important and it is not clarified unambiguously at present .    in this paper using ac susceptibility measurements we present the results of study of intergranular sc properties of the @xmath30 @xmath31 ceramics with fixed and variable compositions depending on @xmath15 .",
    "an ac susceptibility @xmath32 measurement technique was applied in order to determine the critical parameters of high @xmath33 superconductors .",
    "the experimental equipment is described in detaile in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "note that the sample s temperature changed from 78 to 100 k and was measured within the accuracy of @xmath34 0.1 k.    the samples of about 3 mm in diameter and about 9 mm in height were prepared by the well known ceramic technology .",
    "the concentration @xmath8 of @xmath35 isotops which substituted copper atoms were : 0 ; 0.002 ; 0.003 ; 0.005 ; 0.007 and 0.01 which are subsequently referred as # 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "for these samples the @xmath6 was changed between 91 and 92 k , and their bulk density had the following values : 5.29 ; 5.22 ; 4.64 ; 4.71 ; 3.92 and 5.00 @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "we have also studied another sample # 6 , containing atom of @xmath37 isotope with @xmath38 as a substitutional element for copper and having the following parameters:@xmath39 ; @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "the sample s density was defined by their weights and sizes .",
    "note that we does not measure the peak positions of @xmath42 for sample # 5 because they were below 78 k [ 11 ] .",
    "note , that in our investigation we also use the shielding capability of the samples .",
    "as such a parameter we have chosen the value of @xmath43 at 78 k in arbitrary units .",
    "1 shows the temperature dependences of imaginary @xmath44 ( a ) and real @xmath45 ( b ) parts of magnetic susceptibility for the samples with variable composition and different density ( curves from 0 to 5 ) .",
    "the analogous results are presented in the same fig .",
    "( curves 5 and 6 ) for samples # 5 and # 6 with the same composition x = 0.01 and different densities 5.00 and 3.87@xmath36 , respectively .    as is seen in fig.1 with the increasing of x a shift of both the @xmath7 peak position on the @xmath46 @xmath47 curve and the corresponding low temperature inflection point on the @xmath48 @xmath47 curve to the low temperatures was observed which agrees with our previous results [ 11 ] .",
    "such a behavior display also the samples having @xmath49 with increasing of @xmath14 . at the same time",
    "the broadening of the sc transition was observed on both curves @xmath50 @xmath47 and @xmath51 @xmath47 .",
    "the strong dependence of sc properties versus density is obvious from fig . 1 where the @xmath7 for sample # 5 was shifted to below the temperature of liquid nitrogen while for sample # 6 @xmath29 @xmath52 @xmath53 k .",
    "this behavior agrees with our previous results of @xmath29 versus x and it can be explained as follows .",
    "the @xmath7 decreasing with increasing of x is due to the formation of weak links in the granuls [ 11,12 ]",
    ". and the observed decrease of @xmath7 with increase of sample s density , as assumed in [ 7,8 ] , may be caused by the reduction of the role of josephson vortices pinning which is in its turn due to the reduction of the thickness of intergranular layers .",
    "it can be mentioned that the high density samples sintered by conventional method , have low oxygen content [ 6 ] which enhances the role of inhomogeneities induced in samples by iron doping @xcite .",
    "hence , these inhomogeneities lead to the additional broadening of the sc transition in denser samples ( fig.1 , curves 3 and 4 ; 5 and 6 ) .",
    "one can also indicate a peculiarity of @xmath50 @xmath47 curves : the shielding capability ( fig .",
    "b ; 5 , 6 curves ) decreases twice with the increase of @xmath14 for the fixed value @xmath38 which contradicts the results in [ 7,8 ] .",
    "this indicates additionally that the samples with higher density can have an oxygen deficiency [ 6 ] which cause the reduction of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "note , that the @xmath6 versus @xmath14 shows a fluctuation character and ranges in 91 - 92 k interval .",
    "such behavior was found in undoped y- based samples [ 4,5 ] with the difference that the @xmath6 changes monotonously from 89 to 95 k with increasing of @xmath14 from 3.4 to 5.4 @xmath36 .",
    "the variation of @xmath6 with @xmath14 according to [ 4,5 ] can be explained as follows .",
    "the samples with higher density are sintered under the high pressure and have a high concentration of structural defects , created by plastic deformation after the pressure .",
    "these defects are probably concentrated near the grain boundaries and reduce strongly the @xmath7 , which is observed in our experiments for the # 5 sample having higher density in comparison with sample # 6 .",
    "if the accumulated structural defect concentration exceeds some critical value , the sample undergoes from orthorhombic to the tetragonal type of symetry [ 4,5 ] . hence in order to obtain samples with higher density and better sc properties it required that they undergo special thermal treatment [ 5 ] .    from the magnetic field dependence of sc transition in sample",
    "one can speculate about pinning of magnetic flux lines , which leads to gaining information about the htsc phenomenon [ 11,12 ] .",
    "the run of @xmath55 @xmath47 curves for some applied ac magnetic field amplitudes in sample # 3 are presented in fig .",
    "curves of @xmath56 for all samples are also presented in fig .",
    "the common behavior for all samples is the shift of @xmath7 to the lower values with increasing of magnetic field amplitude @xmath57 .",
    "it is typical that all curves @xmath56 reveal strong and weak region of decreasing of @xmath7 which evidences about the existence in samples of  strong  and  weak  pinning centres for josephson magnetic vortices [ 11 ] . from figures 2 , 3",
    "one finds that the magnetic field @xmath57 region for strong decreasing of @xmath7 is narrowing with increasing of @xmath14 which agrees with the results obtained from the measurements of high frequency electromagnetic field absorption in y - based samples [ 9 ] .",
    "however it should be emphasized that the latter , well agrees with the results of refs .",
    "[ 7,8 ] , but condraticts ref .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is not obvious , however , it may be attributed to the different techniques for detecting of critical parameters in referred works .",
    "for instance , in y - based samples the onset temperature of diamagnetism @xmath58 decreases [ 7,8 ] , while the onset temperature of appearance of the electroresistivity , increases with increasing of @xmath14 [ 7 ] .    as it is known [ 9,11 ] , the slope of @xmath56 curve characterizes the pinning force for josefson vortices and the higher the slope is the lower the pinning force becomes .",
    "one can find from fig.3 that for sample # 3 with lower iron content and higher @xmath14 in respect to sample # 6 , the curve @xmath56 at @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 has a higher slope .",
    "hence , the increase of sample density leads to the decrease of pinning force and/or to decrease of the pinning role of josefson vortices [ 7,8 ] .    in # 2 , 3 , 4 samples the iron content @xmath8 increases monotonously while their densities almost monotonously decrease .",
    "hence the dropping rate of @xmath62 in these samples consequently decreases .",
    "4 represents both the dependence of @xmath7 for several @xmath57 and the shielding capability at t = 78 k versus iron concentration which clearly describes the role of bulk density in variation of sc properties of samples .",
    "it is obvious that these two parameters display the correlative behavior : they sharply drop with initial increasing of x and formate a plateau in @xmath63 region and further decrease when @xmath8 reaches to 0.01(sample # 5 ) .the observed plateau can be explained as follows . in the first two samples the density almost does not change , only the iron concentration @xmath8 increases which leads to the decrease of @xmath7 [ 11,12 ] .",
    "further , although the @xmath8 increases , the @xmath14 almost monotonously decreases which according to [ 7,8 ] leads to the decrease of droping rate of @xmath7 versus @xmath8 and hence causes the formation of a plateau in the above mentioned @xmath8 region .",
    "further , the simultaneous increase of @xmath8 and @xmath14 leads to the strong shift of @xmath7 to the temperatures below 78 k [ 8 ] , as seen from fig .",
    "1 ( curve 5 ) . therefore in fig .",
    "4 the imaginary run of @xmath7 for @xmath38 is presented by dotted lines.from this figure one can see that the sample # 6 , even for relatively higher values of @xmath57 , has significantly higher values of @xmath7 ( fig.4 , symbols 4 and 5 ) .",
    "this means that in the samples with higher density the @xmath7 drops rapidly with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "the analysis of intergranular sc properties of @xmath16 ceramics with different @xmath8 and bulk density allows to draw the following conclusions .",
    "the intergranular losses peak temperature @xmath7 decreases rapidly with the increasing of iron content in the samples with a higher density .",
    "partialy , in the samples with @xmath38 and higher density the shift of @xmath29 to the region below 78 k was observed .",
    "the simultaneous increase of iron concentration and bulk density in the samples leads to the rapid decrease of @xmath7 .",
    "a plateau is observed on the @xmath65 curves in the @xmath9 region due to the almost monotonous decrease of density in the same region .    \\4 .",
    "the shielding capability at 78 k also shows a plateau in the same @xmath8 region . besides , it was found that this parameter is about twice lower for the samples with fixed @xmath38 and higher density , which contradicts the results obtained in refs .",
    "such behavior probably may be attributed to the oxygen deficiency in the samples due to the higher bulk density ."
