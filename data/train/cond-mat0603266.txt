    "the characterization , using numerical simulations , of the phase transition in the three dimensional ising spin glasses has been a challenging problem . recently a clear picture of the phase transition and good estimates of the critical exponents",
    "have been obtained for both gaussian and bimodal disorder by working at equilibrium @xcite .    however a characterization of the phase transition using out of equilibrium techniques is still lacking ( see reference @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . in the first part of this paper",
    "we will address this problem ( simulating the bimodal disorder ) .",
    "in particular we will compute the order parameter using out of equilibrium techniques @xcite and we will characterize the transition using this observable .",
    "in addition we will confront our data with previous estimates of the critical point and critical exponents for this model ( obtained from numerical simulations and from experiments ) .",
    "the behavior of this observable will permit us to discard ( again ) a kosterlitz - thouless like phase transition ( as done in equilibrium @xcite , that we will refer in the following as @xmath1-like scenario ) for the transition @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have studied the dependence of the order parameter with the size of the system .",
    "hence , we will present on this paper the first direct numerical computation of the edwards - anderson order parameter in the three dimensional ising spin glass ( obtained out of equilibrium ) .",
    "this kind of study was performed in the past in four dimensions @xcite ( see also @xcite ) but is still lacking in three dimensions ( the interesting physical dimensions ) .",
    "the second part of the paper is devoted to the study of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem out of equilibrium .",
    "this kind of analysis have attracted a large amount of work ( analytical , numerical and experimental ) in the last years @xcite .    using the results of reference @xcite and assuming that the three dimensional ising spin glass presents stochastic stability ( until now it has not been rigorously proved but there are numerical evidences @xcite ) one can relate the fluctuation - dissipation curves with equilibrium properties and so , compute or measure the equilibrium probability distribution of the overlap .",
    "this computation or measurement is very important since it should discern between the different theoretical approaches in competition , which try to describe the behavior of finite dimensional spin glasses ( e.g. the replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) approach@xcite or the droplet model@xcite ) .",
    "the goal of this ( last ) part of the paper is twofold .",
    "first , to check if the order parameter computed in the first part of this paper matches well in the fluctuation - dissipation ( fd ) curves .",
    "this is important since this value marks the point in which the fd curve departs from its pseudo - equilibrium regime , and the behavior of the curve from this departing point is a clear fingerprint whether or not the system behaves following the rsb theory or the droplet model .    and the second goal is to study the finite time behavior ( for really large times ) of the curves in order to see how the asymptotic form of the fd curves is built up .",
    "this is important , since until now , the numerical simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite show up a behavior compatible with the replica symmetry breaking description and incompatible with droplet theory .",
    "one can argue that the curves reported in the literature @xcite are not asymptotic and that the asymptotic curve is compatible with droplet theory and no compatible with rsb .",
    "finally , we will report the conclusions .",
    "we have simulated a three dimensional system in a cubic lattice with helicoidal boundary conditions of size @xmath2 and volume @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the sum over the first nearest neighbors , @xmath6 are ising variables and @xmath7 are quenched random variables with a bimodal probability distribution with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "we have used the standard heat - bath algorithm ( local dynamics ) to simulate the three - dimensional lattice .",
    "we will introduce the observables measured in our work .",
    "firstly , the order parameter ( the edwards anderson one ) is defined as : @xmath8 where , as usual , we use @xmath9 and @xmath10 to denote thermal and quenched disorder average respectively .    in addition",
    ", the spin - spin correlation function has been computed using @xmath11 we can obtain formally the order parameter from this correlation as the double limit : @xmath12 notice that the order of the limit is crucial in obtaining the order parameter . we will use this equation to extract @xmath13 from the out - of - equilibrium data .",
    "we will study in the last part of the paper the finite time behavior of the violation of the fluctuation - dissipation relation in the three dimensional spin glass .",
    "we will review shortly the main equation of the off - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation equations ( see @xcite for more details ) : @xmath14 where , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the response of the system to the magnetic field perturbation ( i.e. the magnetic susceptibility of the system : @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 is the , in principle unknown , function which controls the violation of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . integrating this equation in @xmath19 and taking the perturbing field as @xmath20 we finally obtain ( working in the linear - response region ) : @xmath21    in the regime @xmath22 we reach the equilibrium , and it is possible to show that @xmath23 .",
    "in addition @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the integral of the probability distribution of the overlap at equilibrium @xcite . hence ,",
    "in this regime @xcite , @xmath26    furthermore , we can define @xmath27",
    "so , @xmath28 both , in droplet theory and rsb ( see reference @xcite , in particular its figure 10 ) , @xmath29 is the straight line @xmath30 for @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "however , for @xmath32 the behavior is very different : in the droplet theory @xmath29 is constant in this region and in rsb @xmath29 is a growing function with curvature .",
    "we recall that knowing the initial point , @xmath33 , we can compute @xmath34 in the droplet theory as @xmath35    this technique allows us to compute , taking the appropriate limit , the equilibrium function @xmath25 .",
    "finally , we report that all the numerical simulations have been obtained with the sue machine  @xcite .",
    "this is a dedicated machine , designed for the simulation of the three dimensional edwards - anderson model with first neighbour couplings@xcite , the system that is being studied in the present work .",
    "it consist of 12 identical boards .",
    "each single board is able to simulate @xmath36 different systems , updating all of them at each clock cycle .",
    "sue reaches an update speed of @xmath37 ps / spin with a clock frequency of @xmath38 mhz .",
    "the on - board reprogrammability permits to change in an easy way the lattice size , or even the update algorithm or the hamiltonian .",
    "the sue machine is connected to a host computer running under linux .",
    "sue is in charge of the update of the configurations , and the host computer is in charge of measurements and analysis .",
    "the main electronic devices of each sue board are the altera family , that performs the update .",
    "other devices store the spins and couplings variables .",
    "one of the alteras is devoted to generate random numbers in a fast way ( for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . up",
    "our knowledge , sue has been the fastest dedicated machine in the simulation of the three dimensional edwards - anderson model .",
    "in order to compute the edward - anderson order parameter ( @xmath39 ) , we have carried out several runs for two lattice sizes and different temperatures : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 ; and @xmath48 and @xmath44 for @xmath49 .",
    "for all of them we have averaged over 58 samples . in figure ( [ fig1 ] )",
    "we report the curves @xmath50 as a function of time @xmath51 .",
    "we have checked that the behavior of @xmath52 for @xmath53 follows with high precision the behavior ( as in higher dimensions , see @xcite ; this is just an ansatz ) : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is related with the value of @xmath39 . in order to find it out",
    "we have first obtained , from figure ( [ fig1 ] ) top , the curves @xmath56 vs. @xmath57 for several fixed values of @xmath51 ( typically , from @xmath58 to @xmath59 monte carlo steps ) ( see figure ( [ fig1 ] ) bottom ) .",
    "we have fitted these curves to the functional form defined in ( [ eq : fit ] ) obtaining in this way the behavior of @xmath55 as function of @xmath51 ( we show these fits in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) ) . from @xmath55 and for @xmath60 , we can obtain the value of @xmath61 ( since asymptotically @xmath55 must became @xmath34 ) . to achieve this aim ,",
    "we have fitted the last points of @xmath55 versus @xmath51 to a constant function ( since @xmath55 shows a clear plateau , see fig.([fig2 ] ) ) . in this way",
    ", we have implemented the double limit in equation ( [ eq : limit ] ) .",
    "the results obtained from these fits are shown in fig.([fig3 ] ) .",
    "we have checked that for @xmath62 the values for @xmath34 are the same for both @xmath47 and @xmath49 . in @xmath63",
    "the difference is about 1.5 standard deviations .",
    "in addition we have run a @xmath64 lattice at @xmath65 and @xmath63 : these data show finite size effects as expected since they lie near the critical point ( see figure([fig3 ] ) ) .",
    "as we mentioned before , we have checked that the @xmath39 , which we have computed out of equilibrium , follows with good precision the critical law of the order parameter    @xmath66    where we have denoted @xmath67 the usual @xmath0 exponent of the order parameter ( in order to avoid confusion with the usual notation @xmath68 )    by fitting only the points closer to the critical one ( satisfying @xmath69 ) we obtain @xmath70 with a @xmath71 .",
    "this figures compare really well with the numerical values obtained at equilibrium  @xcite , namely : @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in particular the difference between the two estimates of @xmath67",
    "is 0.19(11 ) , less than two standard deviations .. ]    in addition , we can compare with experiments . in reference  @xcite",
    "was found @xmath74 which is in a very good agreement with our out equilibrium value .",
    "we have also checked that @xmath39 follows with good precision the critical law    @xmath75    again , we have only used in the fit the points with @xmath69 ( critical region ) .",
    "moreover we can fix @xmath67 to the experimental value , obtaining again a compatible value with the equilibrium one : @xmath76 , where the first error is statistical and the second error comes from the error of the experimental @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , by fixing @xmath67 to the numerical simulations value we obtain @xmath77 , less than three standard deviations from the numerical value .",
    "all figures reported in this analysis are compatible with latest estimates of the critical exponents . in reference",
    "@xcite @xmath78 and @xmath79 were reported .",
    "in addition a diluted version of this model was studied in @xcite and @xmath80 was reported .",
    "finally , we remark that our numerical results from both @xmath81 and @xmath67 must suffer from the systematic error coming from the dependence of @xmath34 with @xmath2 near the critical point ( as shown the @xmath64 runs ) . at @xmath63",
    "we have three different values of the order parameter that fit to the law @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are constants .",
    "this is the finite volume correction equation which holds in the low temperature phase   by fitting @xmath85 .",
    "notice that in our case we are using @xmath86 data and we simulate the @xmath87 model and that the @xmath84 exponent could depend on the temperature .",
    "notice that usually in equilibrium small lattices develop larger order parameter , however , in our dynamical approach we have found the opposite behavior . ] . we have obtained @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( notice that we are fitting three points to a three parameter function ) to be compared with @xmath90 and @xmath91 . at @xmath92 ( the nearest value we have to the critical point )",
    "we have only two points , that anyhow , we can try to fit to equation ( [ eq : fit2 ] ) fixing @xmath88 , obtaining @xmath93 ( no error bars can be reported since , again , the number of degrees of freedom in this fit is zero ) to be compared with the value of our largest lattice @xmath94 , so this limited analysis suggests that the @xmath47 lattice is asymptotic in its error bars in the region @xmath95 . hence , we are confident that our final estimates of @xmath81 and @xmath67 should have small systematic error coming from finite size effects .",
    "we remark that testing the dependence of @xmath13 with the lattice size , for large lattices ( e.g. @xmath49 ) near the transition is not accessible even using the sue machine .",
    "we have performed several runs again with sue machine , in a lattice of size @xmath49 for different temperatures : @xmath96 and @xmath45 . we have used the following standard procedure .",
    "we let the system evolve during a time @xmath57 , just after this time , a field @xmath97 is plugged , seeing the response of the system and recording the magnetization and the correlation function .",
    "then it is possible to extract the value of @xmath98 , for the particular @xmath0 being analyzing at that moment , from the point where the curve leaves the linear regime , that is , where @xmath99 does not follow the pseudo - equilibrium line @xmath100 .",
    "the choice of the field strength applied to the system has not been arbitrary .",
    "we need to stay in the linear - response region .",
    "we have checked this by simulating different magnetic fields : @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "finally we have selected a safe value for @xmath103 : @xmath97 , which is a compromise between large and small fields ( notice that small fields induce strong noise in the measures ) . in figure ( [ figf ] ) we have shown the fdt curve for a waiting time and two perturbing magnetic fields ( @xmath104 and 0.003 ) in order to test that we are in the region in which linear - response holds .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the curve , inside the error bars , is independent of the perturbing magnetic field .    in the droplet model",
    ", the curve @xmath18 departs horizontally from the straight line @xmath30 , the final value of the horizontal line being @xmath105 ( i.e. @xmath33 ) , where @xmath106 is the equilibrium value of the magnetization in a field @xmath103 at the temperature @xmath107 .",
    "hence , measuring @xmath106 we can obtain the droplet theory estimate for the order parameter as : @xmath108    we will shown in this section plots corresponding to @xmath109 and @xmath49 . in order to obtain numerically @xmath106 we have performed a very large in - field numerical simulation recording the value of the magnetization at the time @xmath51 : @xmath110 . the asymptotic value is simply @xmath111 ( this observable shows really small dependence on @xmath2 for the lattice sizes simulated in this paper ) . to avoid extrapolations",
    "we have continued the run until the magnetization shows a plateau ( this means that the magnetization has reached its equilibrium value ) , and so we extract the value of @xmath106 by computing the position of this plateau . for instance , we show in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) the magnetization as a function of time for @xmath109 and @xmath49 .    by computing the asymptotic value of the magnetization for different temperatures ,",
    "we obtain a reliable estimate for the order parameter in the droplet theory . in table",
    "[ table_droplet ] we report these values for the droplet theory estimates and , in addition , we write the values for the order parameter obtained in the first part of this paper , that we will denote in the rest of the paper as @xmath112 .    .[table_droplet ] @xmath113 for @xmath49 from @xmath50 ( obtained in the first part of the paper ) and assuming droplet theory from @xmath99 .",
    "all the data showed in this table were obtained in a @xmath49 lattice except for dynamical @xmath34 at @xmath114 that was obtained simulating a @xmath47 lattice . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we recall that the values of @xmath112 reported in table [ table_droplet ] have small finite size effects ( taking into account their error bars ) as checked in figure ( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we have found strong discrepancies between @xmath112 and @xmath115 for small temperatures .",
    "we will describe in the rest of the paper our results for the violation of fdt out of equilibrium .    in figure ( [ fig5 ] )",
    "we report the fd data out of equilibrium for one of the lowest temperature simulated .",
    "we have shown a vertical band which marks the our estimate of @xmath116 , a straight line @xmath30 to monitor the departure of this linear behavior and a horizontal band which marks @xmath117 ( see figure ( [ fig4 ] ) ) .",
    "in addition we have plotted data from three different waiting times .",
    "figure ( [ fig5 ] ) shows that our estimate for @xmath116 matches very well in the plot and marks the region in which the fd data starts to depart from the linear behavior ( for all the temperatures simulated ) . in figure ( [ fig6 ] )",
    "we have drawn a magnification of this region .",
    "in addition , in this figure one can see that the finite time effects in the building of the asymptotic curve are small .",
    "practically the two biggest waiting times are compatible in the error ( there is a factor ten in waiting time ) . with the state - of - the - art dedicated computed of the day",
    "it is impossible to simulate larger waiting times .",
    "we can conclude from this figure that we are unable to see dependence in waiting time for the two largest waiting times in the region in which they depart from the linear behavior .",
    "the dependence on the waiting time for larger times is smaller than our statistical errors . from our numerical data",
    "a droplet theory fluctuation - dissipation asymptotic curve seems unlikely .",
    "we have study numerically and out of equilibrium the three dimensional ising spin glass with bimodal disorder .",
    "by computing the off equilibrium spin - spin correlation function we have been able to extract the order parameter of the phase transition .",
    "the study of the behavior of this order parameter with temperature permit us to compute the critical temperature and the associated critical exponent : both figures compare very well with previous numerical simulations and experiments .",
    "we have also discarded a @xmath1-like scenario ( we have found a non - vanishing order parameter in the low temperature region ) .",
    "we have also monitored the dependence of @xmath118 with the lattice size in the low temperature region for one @xmath0 .    in the second part of the paper we have extracted the droplet prediction for the order parameter by computing the asymptotic value of the susceptibility ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the droplet prediction compares ( for all the @xmath0 s simulated ) well with the order parameter computed in the first part of the paper for high temperature ( of course , slightly below the critical temperature ) , but for lower temperatures the comparison is bad .",
    "moreover the analysis ( for larger waiting times ) of the fd curves show a behavior that can be described in the rsb theory and points out that the droplet scenario seems unlikely ( only a really small dependence on waiting time , outside of the precision of this work , could build a final fd curve compatible with the droplet theory ) .",
    "moreover the point in which the numerical data depart from the linear behavior compares well with the estimate obtaining in the first part of this paper , supporting the rsb scenario .",
