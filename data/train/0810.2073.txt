    "the physical properties of nanosized material have attracted considerable attention because of its technological importance as well as its fundamental interest for theoretical study .",
    "one important thermodynamic property is its size - dependent melting point depression , which , in fact , has been studied for decades .",
    "this unusual behavior of nanoparticles can lead to develop new features of materials with wide applications @xcite .",
    "experimental studies show that ( with a few exceptions ) , for free surface nanoparticles , the melting temperature decreases with decreasing size , and has irregular variations on a fine scale @xcite .",
    "many theoretical models have been employed to investigate this unusual property . of these various models",
    "we can classify them into many categories , thermodynamical models @xcite , latent heat model @xcite , the surface - phonon instability model @xcite , the liquid drop model @xcite , and bond energy model @xcite .",
    "most of these models give the result that , the nanoparticle melting temperature @xmath0 relative to the bulk melting temperature @xmath1 decreases linearly with size in a general form such as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the nanoparticle diameter and @xmath4 is a constant depending upon the modeling parameters .",
    "some other models have a nonlinear form to fit better for smaller sizes ( @xmath5 nm ) @xcite .",
    "the melting properties of two - dimensional penrose lattices have been studied by huang et .",
    "al , who made use of the phonon spectrum and the lindemann melting criterion @xcite .",
    "it showed that the boundary atoms always have larger atomic mean - squared thermal vibration amplitudes , which means lower melting temperature .",
    "we will see that a similar behavior also appears in three - dimensional lattices in our calculation .    in this paper",
    ", we study the relation between nanoparticle melting temperature and nanoparticle size by means of the phonon spectrum , and we intend to reveal the melting properties of nanoparticles from a microscopic model . with a statistical melting criterion similar to the lindemann criterion",
    ", we found that the linear depression of nanoparticle melting temperature with decreasing size and the irregular variations on a fine scale was given in our numerical calculation by a very simple model .",
    "two three - dimensional lattice types are considered in this paper . for simplicity , we only calculate near - spherical nanoparticles in this paper . to construct such nanoparticles ,",
    "first , we create the simple cubic ( sc ) or face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattices with @xmath6 lattice points on the edge .",
    "then cut an inscribed sphere in the corresponding lattice type .",
    "the lattice points on and inside the sphere are what we count in the calculation ( actually there are no lattice points on the sphere for even @xmath6 sc lattice ) .",
    "assume that there is one atom at each lattice point , which is the equilibrium position of the atom , and the surface is free .",
    "so we do not have to take surface reconstruction and relaxation into account in this calculation .",
    "we directly calculate the phonon modes in the harmonic approximation for the two lattices of different sizes ( different @xmath6 ) .",
    "the interatomic potentials that we use is the spring potential @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the position of the @xmath9th lattice point and @xmath10 is the displacement of the atom from its equilibrium position @xmath8 ; @xmath11 means that the sum is taken over the nearest neighbors and @xmath12 means the next - nearest neighbors ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 are spring constants for the nearest and next - nearest interactions respectively .",
    "this potential ensures that the structure of nanoparticle we consider is at least one of the lowest energy structures .    within the harmonic approximation",
    ", we can deduce that the atomic mean - squared thermal vibration amplitude @xmath15 is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the number of atoms of the nanoparticle ; @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the mass of the @xmath9th atom ; @xmath21 is the @xmath22th eigenfrequency , and @xmath23 is the component of the eigenvector corresponding to the @xmath22th eigenfrequency .",
    "we set @xmath24 here .",
    "@xmath25 @xmath26 means grand canonical ensemble average .    in bulk materials ,",
    "the lindemann criterion @xcite is commonly used .",
    "it states that a material melts at the temperature at which the amplitude of thermal vibration exceeds a certain critical fraction of the interatomic distance .",
    "experiments and simulations show that its critical value is around 0.100.15 in units of the interatomic distance .",
    "lawson showed that the overall accuracy of the lindemann criterion for the materials he considered is not better than about 30% , and he gave an improved lindemann criterion @xcite . for irregular nanoparticles ,",
    "the distance - fluctuation criterion is introduced @xcite .",
    "it is based on the fluctuation of the distance between pairs of atoms , while the lindemann criterion is based on the fluctuation of individual atoms relative to their average position . and",
    "it has a problem that it depends on the duration of the simulation run @xcite .",
    "it can be seen from the expression of @xmath15 that , when the atoms all have the same mass @xmath27 , the total mean - squared atomic thermal vibration amplitude @xmath28 is determined only by the eigenfrequencies except the mass @xmath29 , because of the orthonormality of the eigenvectors @xmath30 , i.e.   @xmath31 in this case , we can directly use the lindemann criterion in our model and do not need to calculate the eigenvectors at all .",
    "but when the atoms do not have the same mass , we have to and actually we can easily calculate each @xmath15 numerically here .",
    "therefor it is reasonable to use a statistical criterion like the lindemann criterion : _ if more than fifty percent of the @xmath32 exceed half of the interatomic distance , the melting happens_. the  fifty \" and  half \" are not particularly selected and can be tuned . compared to the lindemann criterion , the effect of using these two figures together may be too large .",
    "but obviously they can be tuned to be consistent with the lindemann criterion . and",
    "because the model we use here is so simple and we just focus on qualitative description , there should be no problem to use these two figures in the moment .",
    "we will show that , with this statistical criterion , the linear depression of nanoparticle melting temperature with decreasing size and the irregular variations on a fine scale are reproduced in our model and a crosspoint in the phonon modes and related results are discovered when we consider @xmath33 statistically , although we only consider the case that all the atoms have the same mass .",
    "actually , the eigenfrequencies depend only on the mass @xmath20 and the spring constant @xmath34 in our model .",
    "so each @xmath33 at a given temperature is completely determined when @xmath20 and @xmath34 have been chosen .",
    "different lattice spacing @xmath35 has different melting temperature @xmath0 because of its appearance as equilibrium interatomic distance in the criterion .",
    "in the present calculation , we only consider the case of monoatomic nanoparticles .",
    "the sc type lattice has the nearest - neighbor interaction as well as the next - nearest - neighbor interactions , while fcc type only has the nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "we set @xmath36 for sc and @xmath37{4}$ ] for fcc .",
    "we choose @xmath38 for sc and @xmath39{4}$ ] for fcc so that they have the same number density .",
    "the density of phonon modes for lattices in two different finite sizes along with their thermodynamic limit are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] for sc and fcc respectively .",
    "when the size of nanoparticle becomes larger , the profile of the density of phonon modes becomes smoother .",
    "for the two finite sizes of sc lattices , there are both three peaks at @xmath40 2.4 , 3.4 , and 4.6 .",
    "the peak at @xmath41 lowers down with increasing size , and it becomes a shoulder at a higher frequency @xmath42 ultimately in the thermodynamic limit . so does the peak at @xmath43 , but it increases with increasing size and the shoulder in the thermodynamic limit is at a lower frequency @xmath44 .",
    "the peak at @xmath45 for finite sizes becomes the only peak at a higher frequency @xmath46 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this peak in the thermodynamic limit arises from the symmetry that leads to a large number of degenerate eigenfrequencies at this value . and our calculation",
    "show that when the symmetry breaks , the degeneracy is lifted and peaks beside it appear in finite sizes .",
    "the situation for fcc lattices is similar .",
    "but there are no shoulders in the thermodynamic limit and the peak at @xmath47 in the smaller finite size disappear in the larger finite size while the peak at @xmath48 does not change much for fcc",
    ".    the density of phonon modes for nanoparticles of those sizes , which are smaller than the smaller finite size ( @xmath49 for sc and @xmath50 for fcc ) appears in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] , begins to have zigzag - like profiles and to fluctuate more and more strongly when the size gets smaller and smaller .    , the dotted ( red ) line is for @xmath51 , and the solid ( green ) line is for @xmath52 .",

    "@xmath6 is the number of lattice points on the edge of the cubic lattice , from which we cut the inscribed sphere.,width=302 ]    to see which phonon modes contribute to the melting , we pick out those @xmath53 that meet our criterion and plot the mean contribution from each @xmath54 $ ] to @xmath15 versus @xmath55 at the nanoparticle melting temperature determined by our model .",

    "four different finite sizes for sc and fcc lattices are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contri ] respectively . noted that there is a cross point in both parts of the figure , i.e.  @xmath63 for sc and @xmath64 for fcc , so the eigenfrequencies are divided into two parts naturally : low and high eigenfrequencies . for the smallest size ( the dotted lines ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contri ] , most contributions are from the low eigenfrequencies and the line fluctuates strongly in the low eigenfrequency range . with the increase of the size ,",
    "the contributions from the high eigenfrequencies increase , but the increase becomes smaller and smaller ; the contributions from the low eigenfrequencies get smaller with increasing size and also there is a smaller and smaller decrease , but the change is much bigger than that of the high eigenfrequencies .",
    "apparently , a peak corresponding to the peak at @xmath65 for sc and at @xmath47 for fcc in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] respectively appears in the lines ( the dotdashed line and the dashed line ) for the two middle sizes .",
    "similarly , a peak corresponding to the peak at @xmath66 for sc and at @xmath48 for fcc appears in the line ( the solid line ) for the largest size in fig .",
    "[ fig : contri ] , which will be apparent if we plot it alone .",
    "so the line of contribution becomes more similar to the line of density of phonon modes , when the size becomes larger .",
    "the contributions almost vanish at the highest eigenfrequencies .",
    "so the low eigenfrequencies dominate the melting for relatively small nanoparticles and they can be excited at low temperature .",
    "but for relatively large nanoparticles , the high eigenfrequencies nearly give the same contributions to the melting .",
    "that is why the nanoparticle melting temperature decreases with decreasing size .",
    "we can show that all the phonon modes with small mean neighbor relative deviations , @xmath67 , belong to the low eigenfrequency part .",
    "we call these acoustic - like phonon modes .",
    "most phonon modes with large mean neighbor relative deviations are within the high eigenfrequency part , and we call them optical - like phonon modes . in the acoustic - like modes ,",
    "neighbor atoms tend to vibrate in the same direction similar to the acoustic modes in the diatomic linear chain ; while in the optical - like modes , they prefer to vibrate in the opposite direction .",
    "so with the same thermal vibration energy , the acoustic - like modes can result in larger atomic mean - squared thermal vibration amplitude , but the optical - like modes can not do that because they have large potential energy when the neighbor atoms move to each other with small displacements .    , the dotdashed ( green ) line is for @xmath50 , the dashed ( blue ) line is for @xmath49 , and the solid ( red ) line is for @xmath51 .",

    "[ fig : scr ] for sc and fig .",
    "[ fig : fccr ] for fcc , both with four different finite sizes respectively . here",
    "all @xmath53 are considered no matter whether they contribute to the melting or not .",
    "this is different from fig .",
    "[ fig : contri ] .    apparently , the low eigenfrequencies vibrate the atoms near the surface most , and they have nearly no effect on the inner atoms .",
    "it means surface - premelting , because the low eigenfrequencies are excited at low temperature and they mainly vibrate the atoms near the surface .",
    "this behavior should be a general property in the model similar to ours .",
    "the high eigenfrequencies vibrate the atoms in the middle when the size is relatively small , and they vibrate the atoms all but the inner ones when the size becomes large .",
    "so when most atoms are near the surface , the low eigenfrequencies is sufficient for melting because of their low excitation temperature , and when the size becomes large , more and more atoms are in the middle , the high eigenfrequencies have to be excited at high temperature for melting .     from the center of the inscribed sphere for fcc lattices .",
