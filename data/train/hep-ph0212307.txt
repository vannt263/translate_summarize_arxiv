    "much of the recent interest in theories with extra dimensions stems from the fact that they provide a possible solution to the hierarchy problem of the standard model . in the case of flat extra dimensions",
    "@xcite , the fundamental planck scale could take values of order of the weak scale .",
    "the gravity interactions at long distances are governed by the four dimensional planck scale , @xmath0 , which is related to the fundamental planck scale @xmath1 by a factor proportional to the volume of the extra dimensional space .",
    "therefore , for large values of the compactification scale and/or large number of extra dimensions , one can reconcile the observed value of the planck scale with a fundamental scale @xmath2(tev ) .",
    "since this mechanism demands an a priori unexplained large extra - dimensional volume , it could be argued that rather than providing a solution to the hierarchy problem , theories with flat extra dimensions allow a reformulation of the problem . on the other hand , flat extra dimensions",
    "would only be possible in the presence of a tension - less brane , confining all sm fields . under these conditions , however , it is somewhat more natural to think about a brane with finite tension , and an induced curvature in the extra dimensional scenarios .",
    "non - vanishing curvature provides a distortion of the metric , which allows new alternatives to address the hierarchy problem .",
    "for instance , one can find simple solutions to the case of branes with finite tension by assuming that the local four dimensional metric is affected by an exponential warp factor , which depends linearly on the position of the brane .",
    "in this simple famework , one can get a solution to the hierarchy problem without assuming any unnatural large factor @xcite . indeed , assuming all fundamental mass scales to be of the same order , the ratio of the physical higgs vacuum expectation value to the observable four dimensional planck scale is exponentially suppressed , with an exponent that depends on the warp factor @xmath3 times the position @xmath4 of the higgs brane in the extra dimensions .",
    "taking @xmath5 provides a good solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , as in any other solution , new physics appears at the tev scale .",
    "this new physics includes graviton kaluza klein states and a graviscalar , also called the radion , with effective interactions suppressed by a scale of order of the tev , @xmath6 .",
    "it is natural to assume that not only the higgs field , but all matter fields are confined to the brane at @xmath7 , which we shall call the infrared brane .",
    "the gauge fields , however , may propagate in the extra dimensions .",
    "one motivation for this is the fact that , from the field theoretical point of view , it is more difficult to localize gauge fields than to localize fermions .",
    "however , there is a phenomenological obstacle to this realization : the kaluza klein excitations of the gauge bosons couple with a strength @xmath8 times the zero mode coupling , an order of magnitude larger for values of @xmath9 necessary to provide a solution of the hierarchy problem . the exchange of these strongly coupled higher kk states can be used to set a lower bound on the mass of the first kk excitation that is about 20 tev @xcite .",
    "precision electroweak observables present additional challenges , since these observables are affected at the tree - level @xcite .",
    "the modification of these observables is related to the shape of the extra dimensional wave functions in the presence of a localized symmety breaking vev .",
    "the presence of the localized scalar vev induces a repulsion of the gauge fields from the brane , leading to a breakdown of the usual linear relation between the gauge boson mass with its coupling and the higgs vev . in order to recover acceptable phenomenological predictions ,",
    "the bound on the first kk excitation has to be pushed to even larger values than the ones obtained from the kk boson exchange .    in this article",
    "we analyze how the results for the gauge field interactions described above is modified by the presence of local gauge field kinetic terms .",
    "such terms are naturally expected to be present in any realistic theory , and indeed will be induced radiatively by the localized higgs and fermions on the ir brane even if the underlying dynamics is such that they vanish at any particular scale @xcite .",
    "the presence of a local brane kinetic term on the infrared brane implies that at sufficiently high energies , the gauge interactions on the brane should be four dimensional and renders the brane opaque to gauge fields of short wavelength along the extra dimension .",
    "this can only be possible if there is an important modification of the couplings of the gauge kk modes to matter localized on the brane @xcite .",
    "moreover , for sufficiently large local gauge kinetic terms , the physics on the brane should be dominated by the four dimensional behavior , and therefore it should be possible to relax these bounds on the mass of the lightest gauge boson kk mass .",
    "the plan of this work is as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "prop ] , we shall give the expression for the gauge field propagator with brane kinetic terms .",
    "we shall analyze its behavior in different momentum regimes and for different values of the local gauge kinetic terms . in section  [ sec : kk ] , we proceed with the kaluza - klein decomposition . after reviewing the situation in the case of transparent branes , in the absence of local gauge kinetic terms",
    ", we analyze the case of one or two opaque branes .",
    "we also provide a comparison of the results obtained with the kk decomposition with the ones derived from the behavior of the five dimensional gauge field propagator . in section  [ sec : higgs ] , we discuss the effects induced by the presence of a localized higgs vev .",
    "we discuss both the case of vanishing local gauge kinetic terms and the effects associated with the presence of these local terms . in section  [ sec : pheno ] we apply our results to the case where the electroweak gauge bosons propagate in the bulk , and analyze the phenomenological consequences in this scenario .",
    "in particular , we show that the presence of the brane - localized gauge kinetic terms opens the possibility for the first kk excitations to be within reach of the lhc .",
    "we reserve section  [ sec : concl ] for the conclusions .",
    "in this section we derive the tree - level propagator for a gauge field described by the action [ action ] s = - d^4xdy  , where @xmath10 is the determinant of the metric , and capital latin letters refer to the full 5d coordinates , @xmath11 , whereas lower case greek letters refer only to the four uncompactified dimensions , @xmath12 . in the above we",

    "the onset of the higher dimensional scaling indicates that the gauge theory ceases to be predictive when the external 4d momenta are much larger than @xmath75 , and that it should be cut off at a scale @xmath76 , for some constant @xmath77 .",
    "thus , a @xmath17-dependent cutoff on @xmath34 appears naturally in this language .- dependence of the cutoff is simply a consequence of general covariance and the fact that ads is homogeneous .",
    "the statement that the highest energy modes described by the effective theory have @xmath78 translates in position space into minimum _ coordinate _ wavelengths of size @xmath79 .",
    "that is to say , the effective theory describes _ proper _",
    "wavelengths larger than @xmath80 , independent of the position in the bulk . by a similar reasoning",
    ", one can see that the powers of the warp factors @xmath81 in eqs .",
    "( [ veryhighepropagator])([verylowepropagator ] ) are also dictated by general covariance . ]    for the consistency of this picture , it is important to note that , at energy scales above @xmath75 , the observables localized at @xmath17 are only sensitive to the physics of nearby points @xmath49 , such that @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , case iii ) shows that the contributions from far away points @xmath83 are exponentially suppressed for all momenta above the lower cutoff @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the physics associated with some energy scale at @xmath17 is effectively shielded from contributions that would be outside the region of validity of the effective theory .",
    "it is remarkable that the gauge field tree - level propagator with endpoints at @xmath17 exhibits a purely four - dimensional scaling at all scales below @xmath75 .",
    "this property together with the shielding discussed in the previous paragraph are an important ingredient in the understanding of the four - dimensional  running \" of the gauge couplings that has been discussed recently @xcite .",
    "in fact , if one defines the gauge coupling at @xmath17 at a scale @xmath34 via the two point gauge correlator with endpoints at @xmath17 and external momentum @xmath34 , as advocated in @xcite , one can understand from the above discussion that , provided @xmath85 , all the propagators that are relevant in a loop calculation will exhibit a four dimensional scaling .",
    "therefore , such momentum integrals will depend logarithmically on @xmath34 , with no power - law sensitivity .    from the behavior of the five dimensional propagator @xmath86 , eqs .",
    "( [ veryhighepropagator])([verylowepropagator ] ) , we can also quickly understand some of the effects induced by the presence of the local terms . considering again coincident points @xmath41",
    ", we see that for @xmath87 , there are three different regions . away from the boundaries we find , as before , the five dimensional scaling @xmath88 , and we conclude that the brane kinetic terms have an exponentially small effect ( that does not show up at this order ) , as expected from locality . on the branes , however , we find @xmath89 and similarly for @xmath90 with @xmath91 in place of @xmath92 and @xmath93 in place of @xmath94 .",
    "this shows that , for brane observers , a four dimensional behavior is recovered for @xmath95 where @xmath96 on the uv brane and @xmath97 on the ir brane . note that the ir crossover distance has been appropriately red - shifted as is generally expected for dimensionful parameters in the randall - sundrum setup .",
    "we postpone a further analysis of the physics behind the behavior of the propagator when @xmath92 and @xmath98 are nonzero to the next section . here",
    "we only note that , from a theoretical point of view , it is perfectly consistent to take the coefficients @xmath92 , @xmath98 to be large in units of the fundamental length @xmath99 , as long as we include their effects exactly as has been done here .",
    "as we have seen , the previous exact propagator does not change the divergence structure of the 5d theory , except on the branes , where it actually softens it .",
    "in particular , it is consistent to assume that all other couplings are small so that perturbation theory is valid , even if the brane kinetic terms are larger than their `` natural '' scale @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , when the gauge fields are identified with the carriers of the standard model interactions , one can derive some constraints on the size of the brane kinetic terms from the fact that the observed standard model gauge couplings are of order one .",
    "for simplicity , and because it is the case that will interest us in the phenomenological applications of section 5 , let us consider the case where @xmath100 . from eq .",
    "( [ verylowepropagator ] ) , we see that the observed zero mode gauge coupling , @xmath101 , is given by [ 4dgaugecoupling ] g_0 ^ 2 = = ( 1 + ) ^-1  . in the limit",

    "the second effect is that , due to the decoupling of the gauge field from the ir brane , the masses of the zero mode ( and light kk modes for sufficiently large values of @xmath203 ) are no longer governed by the higgs vev .",
    "this behavior is apparent in figure  [ fig : massesr0v ] where one sees that for @xmath206 the mass of the zero mode increases linearly with @xmath207 , with value @xmath208 . for @xmath209 ,",

    "the situation in the case of a local gauge kinetic term on the ir brane is somewhat different .",
    "this is due to the fact that at sufficiently large momenta the physics should be dominated by the local brane term and therefore for large values of @xmath98 compared to @xmath4 and @xmath182 there should be a mode with coupling to the ir brane given by the local gauge coupling and mass given approximately by this coupling times the vev of the higgs field .",

    "in fact , the internal consistency of the precision electroweak data is dramatically improved by the exclusion of the hadron asymmetries : while the fit to the combined data from these colliders has a confidence of about @xmath344 @xcite , it increases to more than 30@xmath345 once the hadronic asymmetries are excluded .",
    "this suggests that , in order to improve the consistency of the precision electroweak data either one must postulate an error in the experimental determination of @xmath343 and invoke new physics to raise the higgs mass above the direct search limits @xcite , or one must introduce new physics that directly modifies the couplings of the bottom quark in order to restore the consistency of the measurements @xcite .    the rs model does not discriminate between the leptons and quarks , and thus this second option is denied to us .",
