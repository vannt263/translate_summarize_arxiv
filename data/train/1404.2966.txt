    "however , much less is known about random walk records in higher dimensions @xcite .",

    "hence , we can restrict our attention to random walks with unit jump length : @xmath27 and @xmath28 are chosen with equal probabilities .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly summarize basic properties of the record including the distribution of records and the mean record . since record is coupled to position",
    ", we study the joint density of superior walks with given record and position .",
    "this distribution obeys the diffusion equation , and we obtain the long time asymptotic behavior using scaling analysis ( section iii ) . in the complementary case of",
    "inferior walks the analysis simplifies because it suffices to consider only the position ( section iv ) .",
    "a few generalizations are mentioned in section v , and concluding remarks are given in section vi .",
    "we use a simple random walk as a model for brownian motion in one dimension @xcite .",
    "the random walk starts at the origin , @xmath29 at time @xmath30 , and in each time step , its position changes by a fixed amount @xmath31 with these jump rules , the average position does not change , @xmath32 , while the the mean square displacement equals time @xmath33 .",
    "the record , defined in eq .  , equals the maximum position to date . for a simple random walk",
    ", the average record grows as the square root of time @xmath34 this behavior represents the leading asymptotic behavior .",
    "similar behavior holds as long as the jump length distribution has zero mean and a finite variance , and in general , the ratio between the average record and the mean square displacement approaches a constant , @xmath35 in the limit @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath36 be the probability distribution function that the record equals @xmath37 at time @xmath24 .",
    "this quantity follows from the probability that @xmath38 for all @xmath20 .",
    "the probability of this event is the same as the survival probability @xmath39 that a random walker starting at the origin never crosses @xmath40 during the time interval @xmath14 .",
    "the quantity @xmath39 is well known and can be conveniently expressed using the error function , in the long - time limit @xcite .",
    "the probability that @xmath41 is then @xmath42 which is asymptotically equivalent to @xmath43 . as a result ,",
    "the probability distribution function @xmath36 is a one - sided gaussian , @xmath44 for @xmath45 . in particular , we recover the probability that the random walk remains in negative half - space , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath46 be the @xmath40th moment of the record distribution .",
    "the zeroth moment , @xmath47 , reflects that the probability distribution is normalized , and the first moment , @xmath48 , gives the average quoted in .",
    "the second moment @xmath49 gives the variance , @xmath50 the average , the variance , and the distribution function show that the record grows as square - root of time , @xmath51 .",
    "hence , the typical record mimics the behavior of the typical position @xmath52 .",
    "we now focus on superior walks , that is , walks for which the record exceeds the average record , @xmath19 at all times @xmath53 .",
    "since record @xmath37 is coupled to position @xmath54 , we have to consider how the pair of coordinates @xmath55 evolves with time .",
    "the position changes at each time step .",
    "however , the record may or may not change , and there are two possibilities . when @xmath56 the position changes but the record stays the same ( see fig .  [ fig - ill ] ) @xmath57 when @xmath58 , the position changes and depending on jump direction , the record may increase , @xmath59 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - ill ] , the position performs ordinary random walk in the @xmath60 plane , and there is also upward `` slip '' along the diagonal @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath61 be the density of superior walks with position @xmath54 and record @xmath62 at time @xmath24 .",
    "a sum over all records and positions gives the probability that a random walk is superior @xmath63 in the discrete time formulation the sums are actually finite , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the jump rules  imply the following recurrence equations which relate the density at time @xmath66 to the density at time @xmath24 ,    @xmath67    equation is valid for all @xmath56 and it corresponds to cases where the record was set before the final step .",
    "equation describes the evolution of the density along the diagonal @xmath58 and it contains a contribution from walks in which the record was set at the final step .    for the random walk , position @xmath54 and record @xmath37 are discrete variables .",
    "since we are interested in the long - time asymptotic behavior , we may treat these variables as continuous .",
    "the density @xmath61 satisfies the diffusion equation @xmath68 in the domain @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this equation follows from the recurrence equation , and it reflects that the position undergoes an ordinary diffusion process . to obtain",
    ", we replace the left - hand side in with a first - order taylor expansion in time , @xmath71 , and similarly , replace the right - hand - side with a second order expansion in position @xmath54 .",
    "the diffusion equation is subject to the boundary condition @xmath72 on the diagonal @xmath58 .",
    "this relation , which properly accounts for the upward slip along the boundary , can be derived from the recurrence equation by repeating the steps leading to .",
    "we now introduce a new variable @xmath73 which is a linear combination of record and position @xmath74 with this transformation of variables @xmath75 , the diffusion process takes place in the domain @xmath76 , and importantly , the boundary condition simplifies to @xmath77 , along the diagonal @xmath78 . according to equation",
    ", the density @xmath79 still obeys the diffusion equation @xmath80 in the domain @xmath81 .    as discussed in section",
    "ii , the position and the record both grow as square root of time , and , and consequently , .",
    "hence , the density of superior walks has the scaling form @xmath82 this scaling form is compatible with and the algebraic decay @xmath1 . the scaling function @xmath83 depends on the variables @xmath84 and @xmath85 corresponding to the scaled position and record , respectively . for superior walks we have @xmath86 and from equation",
    ", we conclude @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "hence , we have the boundary condition @xmath89 on the line @xmath90 .    the boundary condition @xmath91 on the diagonal @xmath78 implies @xmath92 when @xmath93 .",
    "this suggests to seek a scaling function that depends on the variable @xmath94 alone , . by substituting the scaling form into the diffusion equation , we find that @xmath95 obeys the second - order ordinary differential equation @xmath96 where prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath94 .",
    "the boundary condition is @xmath97 .",
    "the first two terms in imply that @xmath95 has a gaussian tail , when @xmath98 .",
    "next , we make the transformation and arrive at the parabolic cylinder equation with index @xmath99 @xcite @xmath100 this equation has two independent solutions : @xmath101 and @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the parabolic cylinder function of index @xmath104 .",
    "since the density vanishes , as @xmath98 , we choose the former solution , and therefore , @xmath105 .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath97 `` selects '' the persistence exponent @xmath106 as the smallest root of the transcendental equation @xmath107 in agreement with the announced result .     versus the scaling variable @xmath94 .",

    "finally , the asymptotic behavior @xmath111 shows that the density has a gaussian tail @xmath112 $ ] .",
    "it is straightforward to compute various moments of the joint distribution . in the long - time limit , these moments are directly related to moments of the scaling function @xmath113 , and it is convenient to use the adjusted moments .",
    "remarkably , the average position of superior walks @xmath114 coincides with the average record , @xmath115 .",
    "as expected , the average record of superior walks grows faster , @xmath116 with @xmath117 or @xmath118 .",
    "finally , the position and the record are correlated random variables , , as follows from with @xmath119 .",
    "inferior walks are simpler to analyze because they can be defined in terms of position alone : a walk is inferior if and only if @xmath120 for all @xmath20 . indeed ,",
    "if the position exceeds the average record , the record necessarily crosses the average .",
    "conversely , if the position never exceeds the average record , then the record remains below average .",
    "hence , inferior walks map onto diffusion in the presence of a receding trap with location that grows as square root of time , a problem that was solved in ref .  @xcite .    since it is not necessary to keep track of the record , we study the distribution of position .",
    "let @xmath121 be the density of inferior walks with position @xmath54 at time @xmath24 .",
    "the probability @xmath23 that a walk remains inferior after @xmath24 steps is the integral of the density , .",
    "the density of inferior walks obeys the diffusion equation @xmath122 in the domain @xmath123 , and is subject to the boundary condition @xmath124 .",
    "we anticipate the scaling behavior @xmath125 and impose the boundary condition @xmath126 .",

    "the function @xmath130 obeys the parabolic cylinder equation @xmath131 this equation has two linearly independent solutions : @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the density should vanish as @xmath134 and this requirement gives @xmath135 .",

    "the density of such _ meek _ random walks satisfies the diffusion equation in the growing interval @xmath140 $ ] .",
    "we seek a scaling solution and arrive at the same ordinary differential equations  with a new persistence exponent @xmath141 replacing @xmath142 .",

    "the boundary condition @xmath145 leads to the transcendental equation @xmath146 that specifies the persistence exponent @xmath147 .",
    "the probability that a walk is meek , @xmath148 , is therefore much smaller than the probability that the walk is either superior or inferior .",
    "figure [ fig - st ] shows results of monte carlo simulations for the fractions @xmath0 and @xmath4 of superior and inferior walks .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions . in the computations , we first calculated the average record @xmath149 by considering @xmath150 independent realizations of a discrete - time random walk with @xmath24 steps .",

    "also shown for reference are the theoretical results .,scaledwidth=43.0% ]    to verify that the asymptotic behavior  is robust , we considered two distributions of jump length : ( i ) fixed step size : @xmath27 or @xmath28 with equal probabilities , and ( ii ) a variable step size , chosen with uniform probability in the domain @xmath153 .",
    "the results shown in figure [ fig - st ] are for the latter case and were obtained using @xmath154 independent realizations .",
    "our analysis compared the record @xmath37 with the average record @xmath155 .",
    "we can compare the record with other length scales that grow as square root of time .",

    ". a straightforward generalization of the above analysis shows that the persistence exponents @xmath159 and @xmath160 that govern the abundance of such walks are given by ( figure [ fig - beta ] ) @xmath161 as expected , the persistence exponent increases monotonically with @xmath162 , while the exponent decreases monotonically .",

    "in conclusion , we used the average record to characterize the motion of a brownian particle in one dimension .",
    "a random walk is said to be superior if its maximal position is always above average and similarly , it is said to be inferior if the maximal position is always below average .",
    "we find that the probability that a walk is superior or inferior decays algebraically with time .",
    "this power - law decay is characterized by nontrivial persistence exponents .    for inferior walks",
    ", it suffices to keep track of the position of the walk alone and consequently , the problem reduces to diffusion in the presence of a properly - chosen moving trap . for superior walks , it is necessary to keep track of both record and position , and consequently , the problem involves diffusion in two - dimensional space .",
    "this random process consists of diffusion in the position coordinate and directional motion when the record and the position are equal .",
    "nevertheless , a linear transformation of variables reduces the problem to one - dimensional diffusion in the presence of a moving trap as far as the asymptotic behavior is concerned ( figure [ fig - ill ] ) .",
    "our results address the leading asymptotic behavior .",
    "however , different implementations of a random walk are not entirely equivalent .",
    "for instance , there are corrections to the leading behavior of the average , and @xmath175 .",
    "the constant @xmath176 depends on the distribution of jump lengths and its derivation requires rather intricate analysis @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to understand how corrections to the leading asymptotic behavior ",
    "depend on the distribution of jump lengths .",
    "finally , we mention that records have been extensively used to analyze empirical data such as earthquake inter - event times @xcite and temperature readings @xcite . comparing a sequence of records with a baseline such as",
    "the average provides a measure of performance .",
    "the fraction of superior and inferior record sequences has shown to be a sensible tool for analyzing earthquake data @xcite .",
