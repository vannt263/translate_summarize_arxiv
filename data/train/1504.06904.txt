    "@xmath17 denotes the inner product of @xmath18 and @xmath19 in @xmath20 , while @xmath21 will be used to denote the integral of a function @xmath22 with respect to a measure @xmath13 .",

    "the key idea is to regard the jacobi matrix @xmath9 as the limit of g@xmath0e as the matrix size @xmath1 tends to infinity with @xmath10 .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath37 be a finite random jacobi matrix whose components are ( up to the symmetry constraints ) independent and are distributed as @xmath38 then it is well known in random matrix theory that the eigenvalues of @xmath37 are distributed as g@xmath0e , namely , @xmath39 moreover , by letting @xmath40 with @xmath41 , the matrices @xmath37 converge , in some sense , to @xmath9 . that crucial observation together with a result on moments of g@xmath0e ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we mention some known results on g@xmath0e needed in this paper . in section  3",

    "assume that @xmath12 is a finite jacobi matrix of order @xmath1 ( with the requirement that the off diagonal elements are positive ) .",

    "let @xmath141 since each dyck path @xmath142 is one - to - one correspondence with a dyck path @xmath143 of length @xmath144 , it follows that @xmath145 moreover , let @xmath146 be the first time that the dyck path @xmath75 meets the @xmath134-axis . then either @xmath147 or the dyck path @xmath75 is the concatenation of a dyck path in @xmath148 and another dyck path of length @xmath149 .",
