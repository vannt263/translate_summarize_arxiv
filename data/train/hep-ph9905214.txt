    "the balitsky , fadin , kuraev and lipatov ( bfkl ) @xcite equation resums all leading logarithms of bjorken @xmath2 for hadronic cross sections and structure functions . the solution of the bfkl equation grows like a power of center of mass energy @xmath3 , therefore violating the unitarity bound at very high energies @xcite .",
    "this is one of the major problems of small @xmath2 physics , since the froissart bound @xcite states that the total cross section should not raise faster than @xmath4 at asymptotically high energies .",
    "there is a general belief that the unitarity problem could be cured by resumming all multiple bfkl pomeron exchanges in the total cross section , or , equivalently , in the structure function .    as was argued by mueller in @xcite multiple pomeron exchanges",
    "become important at the values of rapidity of the order of @xmath5 with @xmath6 the strong coupling constant , which is assumed to be small , and @xmath7 .",
    "this result could be obtained if one notes that one pomeron contribution to the total cross section of , for instance , onium  onium scattering , is parametrically of the order of @xmath8 $ ] and the contribution of the double pomeron exchange is @xmath9 $ ] . since multiple pomeron exchanges become important when the single and double pomeron exchange contributions become comparable , we recover eq .",
    "( [ yu ] ) by just equating the two expressions .",
    "after completion of the calculation of the next  to  leading order corrections to the kernel of the bfkl equation ( nlo bfkl ) by fadin and lipatov @xcite , and , independently , by camici and ciafaloni @xcite , it was shown in @xcite that due to the running coupling effects these corrections become important at the rapidities of the order of @xmath10 one can see that @xmath11 for parametrically small @xmath6 .",
    "that implies that the center of mass energy at which the multiple pomeron exchanges become important is much smaller , and , therefore , is easier to achieve , than the energy at which nlo corrections start playing an important role .",
    "that is multiple pomeron exchanges are probably more relevant than nlo bfkl to the description of current experiments @xcite .",
    "also multiple pomeron exchanges are much more likely to unitarize the total hadronic cross section . in this paper",
    "we are going to propose a solution to the problem of resummation of multiple pomeron exchanges and show how the bfkl pomeron unitarizes .    in the previous paper on the subject @xcite we proposed an equation which resums all multiple bfkl pomeron @xcite exchanges in the nuclear structure function . in deriving the equation we used the techniques of mueller s dipole model @xcite . as was proven some time ago @xcite the dipole model can provide us with the equation which is exactly equivalent to the bfkl equation @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the dipole model methods , when applied to hadronic or nuclear structure functions , yield us with the equation which in the traditional feynman diagram language resums the so  called pomeron `` fan '' diagrams in the leading logarithmic approximation , an example of which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fan ] for the case of deep inelastic scattering .    to review the results of @xcite",
    "let us consider a deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of a virtual photon on a hadron or a nucleus .",
    "an incoming photon splits into a quark ",
    "antiquark pair and then the @xmath12 pair rescatters on the target hadron . in the rest frame of the hadron",
    "all qcd evolution should be included in the wave function of the incoming photon . that way the incoming photon develops a cascade of gluons , which then scatter on the hadron at rest . in @xcite",
    "this gluon cascade was taken in the leading longitudinal logarithmic ( @xmath13 ) approximation and in the large @xmath14 limit .",
    "this is exactly the type of cascade described by mueller s dipole model @xcite . in the large @xmath14 limit",
    "the incoming gluon develops a system of color dipoles and each of them independently rescatters on the hadron ( nucleus ) @xcite .",
    "the forward amplitude of the process is shown in fig .",
    "the double lines in fig .",
    "[ dis ] correspond to gluons in large @xmath14 approximation being represented as consisting of a quark and an antiquark of different colors .",
    "the color dipoles are formed by a quark from one gluon and an antiquark from another gluon . in fig .",
    "[ dis ] each dipole , that was developed through the qcd evolution , later interacts with the nucleus by a series of glauber  type multiple rescatterings on the nucleons .",
    "the assumption about the type of interaction of the dipoles with the hadron or nucleus is not important for the evolution .",
    "it could also be just two gluon exchanges .",
    "the important assumption is that each dipole interacts with the target independently of the other dipoles , which is done in the spirit of the large @xmath14 limit .    for the case of a large nucleus independent dipole interactions with the target nucleus",
    "are enhanced by some factors of the atomic number @xmath15 of the nucleus compared to the case when several dipoles interact with the same nucleon @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to assume that the dipoles interact with the nucleus independently .",
    "the summation of these contribution corresponds to summation of the pomeron `` fan '' diagrams of fig .",
    "however , in general there is another class of diagrams , which we will call pomeron loop diagrams . in a pomeron loop diagram",
    "a pomeron first splits into two pomerons , just like in the fan diagram , but then the two pomerons merge back into one pomeron . in other words the graphs containing pomerons not only splitting , but also merging together will be referred to as pomeron loop diagrams . in a large nucleus these pomeron loop diagrams could be considered small , since they would be suppressed by powers of @xmath15 .",
    "this approximation strictly speaking is not valid for the calculation of a hadronic wave function . at very high energies",
    "it also becomes not very well justified even in the nuclear case for the following reason .",
    "the contribution of each additional pomeron in a fan diagram on a nucleus is parametrically of the order of @xmath16 , which is large at the rapidities of the order of @xmath17 given by eq .",
    "( [ yu ] ) .",
    "the contribution of an extra pomeron in a pomeron loop diagram is of the order of @xmath18 , which is not enhanced by powers of @xmath15 and is , therefore , suppressed in the nuclear case .",
    "however , one can easily see that at extremely high energies , when @xmath19 becomes greater than or of the order of one , pomeron loop diagrams become important even for a nucleus , still being smaller than the fan diagrams .",
    "resummation of pomeron loop diagrams in a dipole wave function seems to be a very hard technical problem , possibly involving nlo bfkl or , even , next - to - next - to - leading order bfkl kernel calculations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is the author s belief that these pomeron loop diagrams are not going to significantly change the high energy behavior of the structure functions .",
    "still in the rigorous sense the results of this paper should be considered as resumming the fan diagrams only , which is strictly justified only for a large nucleus .    in @xcite , rewriting the @xmath0 structure function of the target as a convolution of the wave function of the @xmath20 fluctuations of a virtual photon with the propagator of the quark ",

    "this assumption about the size and geometry of the nucleus is being done for simplicity of calculations and our results could be easily generalized to a large nucleus of any shape .",
    "if the nucleus is sufficiently large we can assume that the forward amplitude of the scattering of the original quark ",
    "antiquark pair on the nucleus , @xmath43 , is a slowly varying function of the impact parameter of the virtual photon @xmath29 .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the transverse extent of the dipole wave function is much smaller than the size of the nucleus , and that the impact parameter between the virtual photon and the nucleus is smaller than the radius of the nucleus @xmath44 .",
    "we note that in order to construct @xmath43 in @xcite we integrated over the impact parameters @xmath45 s of the nucleons with which each of the pomerons in fig .",
    "[ fan ] interacted .",
    "that way @xmath29 does not have a meaning of the impact parameter of a pomeron exchange anymore and @xmath29 dependence in @xmath43 becomes purely `` geometrical '' . in a more formal language",
    "we assume that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the typical transverse size of the dipole wave function , and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is zero at the center of the nucleus ) .",
    "if these conditions are satisfied we may neglect @xmath50 and @xmath51 compared to @xmath29 on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn ] ) , which means that the changes in @xmath52 when @xmath29 is varied by @xmath53 are negligibly small . thus suppressing the @xmath29 dependence",

    "now one can see that the evolution equation ( [ 1diff ] ) itself in the large nucleus approximation does not impose any impact parameter @xmath29 dependence .",
    "the latter is only included in the initial conditions given by @xmath60 . since @xmath59 is a slowly varying function of @xmath29 ( constant for a cylindrical nucleus ) our assumption about the slow dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath29 is self consistent .",
    "physically this implies that before the collision , when the incoming virtual photon develops its dipole evolved wave function , it does not have any information about the nucleus .",
    "the information about the thickness of the nuclear medium as a function of the impact parameter comes through @xmath59 when the dipoles interact with the nucleus .",

    "nevertheless the abovementioned assumptions did not change the qualitative behavior of the obtained result and the conclusions could be easily extended to large @xmath274 by performing a different saddle point approximation .    inside the saturation region , for @xmath235",

    "( [ asym ] ) corresponding to the saturation of the total scattering cross section of a quark  antiquark pair of a given transverse size on a nucleus to a constant independent of energy ( [ nsa ] ) . that way we have shown that the coordinate space forward amplitude of the @xmath20 scattering on a nucleus or hadron grows like a bfkl pomeron exchange contribution at moderately high energies ( [ n1 ] ) , and , as energy gets very large it saturates to a constant ( [ nsa ] ) . a qualitative plot of @xmath210 is presented in fig .",

    "we have to admit that in order to construct a solution of eq .",

    ". a numerical solution of eq . ( [ eqn ] ) would probably be very helpful in determining exact values of @xmath210 and @xmath0 at intermediately large rapidities .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath0 structure function given by the solution of eq .",

    "this is shown in eq .",
    "( [ f2a ] ) .",
    "thus we have shown that the bfkl pomeron on the nucleus is unitarized by summation of pomeron fan diagrams .",
    "we also note that we derived an expression for the quasi  elastic ( diffractive ) structure function @xmath42 presented in eq .",
    "( [ f2diff ] ) , which also includes all multiple pomeron exchanges .",
    "we have shown that at moderately high energies the obtained expression behaves like a square of the bfkl pomeron contribution [ eq .",

    "( [ f2da ] ) ] , being equal to a half of the structure function @xmath0 , as expected for black cross sections .    in @xcite",
    "it was argued that the dipole model provides us with the techniques that allow one to resum pomeron fan diagrams at any subleading logarithmic order in the large @xmath14 limit .",
    "that is , if one calculates the next - to - leading order kernel in the dipole model , the resulting equation for the generating functional @xmath284 [ see @xcite ] would provide us with the equation resumming all nlo pomeron fan diagrams .",
    "the resulting equation would be , probably , more complicated than our eq .",
    "( [ eqn ] ) .",
    "it would have a much more sophisticated kernel @xcite and would have cubic terms in @xmath41 on the right hand side .",
    "however , the analysis presented in this paper allows one to hope that this resummation will cure some of the problems of the recently calculated nlo bfkl kernel @xcite .",
    "resummation of one loop running coupling corrections , which are a part of the nlo bfkl kernel , brings a factor of @xmath285 in the one pomeron exchange amplitude , with the constant @xmath286 for three flavors @xcite .",
    "since it introduces an even faster growth with energy than the leading order bfkl pomeron , this factor seems to complicate the problem of unitarization of the pomeron .",
    "however , the inclusion if this factor of @xmath287 in our definition of @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ n1 ] ) would not change the perturbation series of eq .",
    "( [ psol ] ) and the quark ",
    "antiquark scattering amplitude would still be unitarized by multiple pomeron exchanges .",
    "of course a careful inclusion of higher order corrections would lead to much more complicated results .",
    "nevertheless we may hope that inclusion of one loop running coupling corrections would just modify the one pomeron exchange contribution and the multiple pomeron exchanges would still unitarize the total dis cross section .",
    "however , a rigorous proof of this statement is beyond our goals here .",
    "finally we point out that one can use the developed technique to construct a gluon distribution function @xmath288 of the nucleus including multiple hard pomeron exchanges similarly to the way we have constructed the @xmath0 structure function . to do that one has to consider scattering of the `` current '' @xmath289 on the nucleus , similarly to @xcite .",
    "then , in the large @xmath14 limit , it should be possible to derive an equation for the generating functional of the dipole wave function of the current @xmath290 , which , at the end , would provide us with an expression for the gluon distribution function @xmath291 .",
