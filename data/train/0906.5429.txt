    "the latest cosmological data sets and the increasing number of ongoing satellite missions dedicated to cosmology are poised to raise a radically new theoretical scenario as opposed to the description proper of the classical general relativity ( gr ) schemes . the cosmic acceleration detected by supernova surveys @xcite provides the starting point for a new deal in cosmology , since dark energy and dark matter components seem to be needed in order to reproduce the observed phenomenology . over the last decade",
    ", there have been many attempts to build models of effective fluids playing the role of dark energy : the taxonomy of possible explanations includes the resurrection of einstein s cosmological constant ( @xcite and reference therein ) , as well as the introduction of large - scale modifications of gravity @xcite .",
    "recently , a new proposal about the nature of the current cosmic acceleration has been advanced , involving the backreaction of inhomogeneities @xcite as a possible source .    even if the assumptions of spatial homogeneity and isotropy of the matter distribution inspired by the cosmological principle appear to give an adequate ,",
    "although approximate , description of the universe on large scales , the lumpiness of structures and the existence of huge voids are well - known observable properties in smaller regions and at late epochs . the fitting problem , _",
    "i.e. _ , the problem of matching a coarse - grained matter distribution with a spacetime metric obtained with an independent smoothing operator , has been pointed out in refs .",
    "the development of an averaging procedure  smoothing out inhomogeneities of scalar quantities  allows us to implement a new set of averaged contracted einstein equations .",
    "the lack of commutativity between time evolution and the averaging procedure enables the encoding of the kinematics of the universe in terms of new quantities with recognizable backreaction features .",
    "while the averaging formalism is interesting in itself , and the idea of explaining the cosmological data through backreaction in the context of pure einstein gravity with no dark energy is very appealing , it has not been demonstrated yet that this idea works in practice .",
    "it is undeniable that matter inhomogeneities have a backreaction effect but it is not clear that over / under - densities such as those observed around us are sufficiently large to significantly affect the cosmic dynamics , and are not limited to small perturbative effects .",
    "while the jury is still out on whether backreaction explains the observed cosmic acceleration or not , one realizes that virtually all high energy theories attempting to quantize gravity or unifying it with the other interactions predict deviations from gr . in string theories and supergravity",
    "the gravitational field includes , in addition to the massless spin two graviton , a dilaton whose presence is unavoidable and that couples non - minimally to the curvature of spacetime @xcite . such a behaviour is mimicked by scalar - tensor gravity @xcite ( for example , an early representative of string theories , the bosonic string theory reduces to an @xmath1 brans  dicke theory in the low - energy limit @xcite ) .",
    "while scalar - tensor theories are constrained on solar system scales and by the binary pulsar @xcite , we do not have many constraints on larger scales ( except , possibly , those due to the variation of the effective gravitational coupling during big bang nucleosynthesis ) .",
    "it is possible , therefore , that the backreaction idea may have to be implemented in alternative theories of gravity .",
    "in fact , it could even be that , if backreaction does nt quite work in gr , it is `` helped '' by a non - einsteinian component of gravity . in @xcite a formalism that implements buchert s scheme into models with variable newton `` constant '' was already developed , motivated by the non - perturbative renormalization group improvement of the action functional @xcite . here , instead , we restrict our attention to scalar - tensor gravity as the prototypical generalization of gr .",
    "the following observation can be made _ a priori _ : the brans  dicke - like field that necessarily permeates all of spacetime can be described as an effective form of matter by writing the scalar - tensor field equations in the form of effective einstein equations .",
    "the effective energy - momentum tensor characterizing this form of @xmath2-matter easily violates all the energy conditions and , therefore , is more likely to produce the cosmic acceleration .",
    "another aspect is worth pointing out : it is widely believed that quantum corrections to the einstein ",
    "hilbert action introduce quadratic deviations from the usual lagrangian density @xmath3 , which may well have propelled the inflationary epoch in the early universe ,   as in starobinsky s inflation @xcite . for a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe ,",
    "quadratic corrections die off quickly as the universe expands and @xmath3 decreases .",
    "however , in an inhomogeneous universe , they might help the backreaction mechanism .",
    "now , it is well - known @xcite that a theory described by a non - linear lagrangian density @xmath0 in the metric formalism is equivalent to an @xmath4 brans  dicke theory with a scalar field degree of freedom given by @xmath5 with a suitable scalar field potential",
    ". therefore , by studying scalar - tensor theory , we also catch the effect of the simplest quadratic corrections to gr .",
    "the scalar - tensor action expressed in the jordan frame is [ bdaction ] s_st = d^4x \\ { + _ m^m } , where @xmath2 is the brans  dicke - like scalar field with potential @xmath6 and coupling function @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath9 , @xmath3 is the ricci curvature , @xmath10 is the lagrangian density describing the ordinary matter sector with coupling costant @xmath11 , and we adopt the notations of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the conformal transformation g__=^2 g _ , = and the scalar field redefinition d= turn the action  ( [ bdaction ] ) into its einstein frame form s_st = d^4x , where a tilde denotes quantities in the rescaled world , and u ( ) = , _ m()=. the `` new '' scalar field @xmath12 couples minimally to the curvature but non - minimally to the matter fields .",
    "our goal is studying the backreaction mechanism of spatial inhomogeneities on the cosmic dynamics in the context of scalar - tensor gravity . before doing this",
    ", we briefly review the buchert formalism in gr for a universe filled with an irrotational dust . in this case",
    "it is possible to choose a foliation of spacetime with spacelike hypersurfaces orthogonal to the flow at any event .",
    "we will then apply the averaging procedure with respect to a family of observers comoving with the dust and characterized by a four - velocity field @xmath13 , thus avoiding gauge complications related to the choice of an arbitrary set of observers tilted with respect to the cosmological matter fluid @xcite . in actual fact , in an inhomogeneous universe the four - velocity of these observers is not simply @xmath14 but there are also local fluctuations @xmath15 , so that @xmath16 corresponding to the possible choices of time on the inhomogeneous hypersurfaces .",
    "therefore , the procedure adopted here of projecting the einstein equations onto @xmath13 and then averaging is not free of ambiguities and gauge - dependence issues .",
    "this projection and the spatial average do not commute . with this caveat in mind , we proceed as is usually done in the literature by choosing gaussian normal coordinates ( see below ) .",
    "it is also convenient to define a template metric mimicking the main properties of a flrw universe on large scales @xcite but encoding the small scale lumpy structures . in this way",
    "the averaged quantities will assume the usual meaning as in the traditional cosmological framework .",
    "the scale of the domain used in the averaging procedure is chosen as the cosmological volume over which it would be reasonable to recover homogeneity , _ i.e. _ , somehow larger than @xmath17  mpc .",
    "let us briefly recall the essential points of buchert s averaging approach , referring the reader to @xcite for details . for the sake of simplicity we turn our attention to buchert s original model ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "this consists of a universe filled with an irrotational dust as the material source , with energy density @xmath18 and four - velocity @xmath13 satisfying @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding einstein equations and stress - energy covariant conservation equation read @xmath20 where @xmath21 . by adopting gaussian normal coordinates it is possible to apply the standard adm procedure for the 3 + 1 splitting of spacetime @xcite . in these coordinates the spacetime manifold can be foliated with spacelike cauchy hypersurfaces parametrized by the proper time @xmath22 . in this framework",
    "the surfaces are comoving with the fluid in such a way that , casting the metric in the form @xmath23 we have @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the second fundamental form ( extrinsic curvature ) @xmath26 of the geodesic normal slicing of spacetime is introduced as follows : let @xmath27 be the induced metric on the 3-surfaces . then @xmath26 is defined as the lie derivative of this riemannian metric in the time direction , @xmath28 given the form of the metric ( [ pinco1 ] ) , @xmath29 and @xmath30 vanish while @xmath31 can be expressed in terms of the expansion tensor @xmath32 , the expansion scalar @xmath33 , and the traceless shear tensor @xmath34 as [ a4 ] k_ij = -_ij= -(_ij+ g_ij ) , kk_i^i = - ( i , j=1,2,3 ) . denoting with @xmath35 the derivative operator associated with the metric @xmath36 , it is possible to derive the gauss  codazzi relations between the curvature of the 3-surface , the extrinsic curvature and the spacetime curvature @xcite : ^(3)r_= ^(4)r _ h^ _ h^ _ h^ _ h^ _ -k _ k_+k _ k _ , [ gauss1 ]    d_k^_- d_k = h^_r_u^ . saturating indices with the induced metric @xmath36 , it is possible to rearrange eq .",

    "using the definition of the riemann tensor it follows that r_u^u^=k^2-k_k^-_(u^_u^ ) + _ ( u^_u^ ) , [ pinco2 ] with the last term vanishing because of the geodesic equation obeyed by the four - velocity of the dust . by combining  ( [ pinco2 ] ) with  ( [ gauss2 ] ) and taking into account the definition  ( [ pinco3 ] ) of extrinsic curvature , we are able to express the scalar curvature of spacetime as ^(4)r=^(3)+k^2+k_ijk^ij-2_uk .",

    "this means that , in principle , different spacetimes could evolve in different ways even when they have the same average initial conditions .",
    "extra assumptions are needed to close the system , for example assuming a certain effective cosmic equation of state , or demanding a particular functional relationship between @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( as it is done in @xcite in order to obtain scaling solutions ) .",
    "it is convenient to write the field equations of scalar - tensor gravity in the form of effective einstein equations , which allows for the direct application of buchert s formalism to this class of theories .",
    "it must be pointed out that choosing this form of the equations implies that the scalar field @xmath2 plays the role of the inverse of a newton `` constant '' now varying in space and time ( the effective gravitational coupling in the action  ( [ bdaction ] ) is @xmath62 , although the coupling in a cavendish experiment is instead @xmath63 @xcite ) .",
    "it is rather simple to notice that the presence of this extra field introduces a new ambiguity with respect to gr due to the non - linearity of the averaging procedure .",
