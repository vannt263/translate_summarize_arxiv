    "measurements of hadronic structure functions in deep inelastic scattering are kinematically limited to a minimum value of bjorken-@xmath0 due to a finite center - of - mass energy @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , all structure functions , and all parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) @xmath6 extracted from them , must necessarily be extrapolated toward smaller @xmath0 in order to generate predictions for higher energy scattering experiments and to apply quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) sum rules which constrain moments @xmath7 of the pdf s .",
    "structure functions in the @xmath8 limit are often singular , with the best - known examples being the unpolarized structure functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 . at leading twist and leading order in the coupling @xmath11 , @xmath9 is a weighted measure of the total density of partons in a hadron , with its @xmath12 singularity reflecting , in part , the enhancement of soft gluon radiation in qcd .",
    "the dynamics of this soft gluon radiation are encapsulated in the balitsky ",
    "kuraev  lipatov ( bfkl ) @xcite , balitsky  kovchegov ( bk ) @xcite , and jalilian - marian  iancu  mclerran  weigert  leonidov  kovner ( jimwlk ) evolution equations @xcite , which describe the development of a cascade of small-@xmath0 gluons at high energies by resumming ( at leading order ) the large logarithms @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is an infrared cutoff ) . this parton cascade , as described by the linear bfkl equation , leads to a steep growth in the gluon number density @xmath15 of partons per unit rapidity resulting in a violation of the black disk limit for the corresponding scattering cross sections .",
    "this growth is regulated by the onset of the high - density regime of qcd , where nonlinear multiple rescatterings of the parton cascade in the target ( as described by the bk and jimwlk equations ) _ saturate _ the number density of partons such that @xmath16 remains finite as @xmath17 .",
    "this results in corresponding cross sections satisfying the black disk limit ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the bfkl , bk , and jimwlk equations , however , can not describe the small-@xmath0 limit of the _ polarized _ structure function @xmath1 , which at leading twist and leading order in @xmath11 is a weighted measure of the quark helicity pdf s @xmath18 .",
    "the high - energy / small-@xmath0 asymptotics captured by these evolution equations are insensitive to polarization because , as is well - known , polarization dependence is suppressed at high energies .",
    "the sub - eikonal interactions which do not transfer spin in high - energy scattering enter as power - suppressed corrections to unpolarized cross - sections and to @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the sub - eikonal interactions which do transfer longitudinal spin provide the _ leading _ high - energy / small-@xmath0 asymptotics of the longitudinal double - spin asymmetry @xmath19 and the polarized structure function @xmath1 .",
    "the development of a cascade of _ polarized _ partons at small @xmath0 is thus an interesting and important aspect of high - energy dynamics in qcd which is outside the scope of the canonical small-@xmath0 treatment .",
    "the small-@xmath0 asymptotics of the polarized @xmath1 structure function were studied previously by bartels , ermolaev , and ryskin ( ber ) in the flavor singlet @xcite and non - singlet @xcite cases . unlike with unpolarized small-@xmath0 evolution , in helicity evolution ,",
    "@xmath20-channel quarks play an important role already at the leading order . in the massless limit , quarks automatically transfer spin through the @xmath20-channel due to helicity conservation for massless fermions .",
    "the effective particle exchanged by such dressed quarks is known as the reggeon in the small-@xmath0 literature @xcite , and it has been studied previously in the context of baryon stopping in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "in addition to quarks , a power - suppressed component of gluon exchange can also carry spin through the @xmath20-channel .",
    "while the unpolarized bfkl / bk / jimwlk evolution occurs through the exchange of dressed , longitudinally - polarized gluons ( the `` hard qcd pomeron '' ) , helicity evolution receives contributions from exchanging a pair of dressed gluons with one polarized longitudinally and the other transversely @xcite .",
    "the exchange of quarks and of polarized gluons both enter at the same parametric order and can therefore mix with each other , akin to the mixing which occurs in polarized and unpolarized dokshitzer  gribov  lipatov  altarelli  parisi ( dglap ) evolution in @xmath21 @xcite .    helicity evolution ( like reggeon evolution )",
    "is double - logarithmic , resumming two logarithms of the energy for each power of the coupling : @xmath22 . in this sense",
    ", helicity evolution can be said to be _ stronger _ than the single - logarithmic bfkl / bk / jimwlk evolution , leading to the possibility that the helicity pdf s could become ( almost ) competitive with the unpolarized ones at small @xmath0 , despite their suppression in the initial conditions .",
    "indeed , this is what ber found @xcite : for the flavor singlet case with @xmath23 ( pure glue ) and @xmath24 at @xmath25 , their results required helicity pdf s to grow at small @xmath0 as @xmath26 . in comparison , leading - order fixed - coupling bfkl evolution with the same parameters yields unpolarized pdf s which grow at small @xmath0 as @xmath27 .",
    "the presence of a non - integrable singularity in the helicity pdf s would imply that their contribution to the proton spin @xmath28 is not finite , requiring either higher - order corrections or nonlinear saturation effects at small @xmath0 to regulate the divergence .",
    "the latter scenario would potentially provide a novel path to discovering parton saturation using measurements of the polarized structure functions instead of the unpolarized ones .",
    "motivated by this possibility , and by the need to assess the amount of proton spin at small @xmath0 , we derived in a previous work @xcite evolution equations for the quark helicity pdf s at small @xmath0 , including the nonlinear multiple rescattering which drives parton saturation .",
    "our approach used the modern saturation formalism , relating the helicity pdf s to a polarized dipole amplitude which we calculated in light - front perturbation theory ( lfpt ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting evolution equations involve quark and gluon wilson line operators , along with an object we refer to as the  polarized wilson line \" : an eikonal quark or gluon propagator with the insertion of one or two sub - eikonal vertices carrying polarization information .",
    "these equations do not close in general because they involve higher - order operators in the evolution kernel ; this should result in a helicity analogue of balitsky hierarchy @xcite .",
    "however , also by analogy to the unpolarized case , our helicity evolution equations do close in the large-@xmath2 and large-@xmath29 limits , with @xmath2 the number of colors and @xmath30 the number of flavors .",
    "the equations are quite complex and difficult to solve , even in the linearized strictly double - logarithmic regime . in an accompanying letter",
    "@xcite we present the numerical solution of our equations at large @xmath2 , obtaining the helicity intercept of @xmath31 .",
    "this leads to helicity pdf s with _",
    "integrable _ singularities at small @xmath0 , scaling as @xmath32 for @xmath23 and @xmath25 , and hence a finite value of the quark spin contribution @xmath33 .",
    "such a scenario would not , in fact , require saturation effects to regulate the small-@xmath0 limit after all .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the value of our helicity intercept in the flavor singlet channel is smaller than that obtained by ber by about @xmath34 @xcite . to understand the source of our significant discrepancy with ber",
    ", we have performed a variety of consistency checks of our equations , which we present here in detail .",
    "this analysis also sheds further light on the intricate structure of helicity evolution at small @xmath0 , which is substantially more complex than the unpolarized evolution which is well - known in the literature .    while our previous paper @xcite dealt with flavor - singlet helicity observables , here we have also generalized the treatment to include flavor non - singlet helicity pdf s and transverse momentum - dependent pdf s ( tmd s ) , along with the @xmath1 structure function .",
