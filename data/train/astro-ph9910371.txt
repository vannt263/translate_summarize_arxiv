    "neutron stars are spotted as pulsars by radio telescopes and x - ray satellites .",
    "they are more massive ( i.e. @xmath1 ) than our sun but are typically only about @xmath2 kilometers across so that the matter in their centers is compressed to densities that are up to an order of magnitude higher than the density of atomic nuclei . a neutron star , therefore , provides a high - pressure environment in which numerous subatomic particle processes are expected to compete with each other and novel phases of matter  like the quark - gluon plasma being sought at the most powerful terrestrial particle colliders  could exist . in my lecture , i will give an overview of the present status of the research on the many phases of superdense matter in neutron stars , which naturally is to be performed at the interface between nuclear physics , particle physics and einstein s theory of relativity .",
    "of particular interest will be the existence of quark matter inside neutron stars and the fingerprints by means of which this novel phase of matter could register itself in the observed neutron star data . the detection of such matter in neutron stars would help to clarify how quark matter behaves , and give a boost to theories about the early universe as well as laboratory searches for the production of quark matter in heavy - ion colliders .",
    "complementary talks on the physics of neutron stars will be given by j.  lattimer and m.  prakash who will be discussing the structure and evolution of neutron stars , and the neutrino interactions in dense matter , respectively .",
    "from model calculations , it is known that neutron stars are far from being composed of only neutrons but instead may possess rather complex interior structures , as established in model calculations performed over the years .",
    "figure  [ fig : cross ] gives an overview of those structures that are currently most vividly discussed in the literature ( for an overview , see @xcite ) .",
    "no matter which physical structures are actually realized inside neutron stars , each one leads to fingerprints , some more pronounced than others though , in the equation of state  ( i.e. pressure versus density ) associated with these phases of matter .",
    "this becomes very evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] ,    which shows a collection of competing models for the equation of state  of neutron star matter @xcite .      only in the most primitive conception",
    ", a neutron star is constituted from neutrons . at a more accurate representation",
    ", a neutron star will contain neutrons ( @xmath3 ) and a small number of protons ( @xmath4 ) whose charge is balanced by leptons ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "the interactions among the nucleons can be treated in the framework of either schroedinger - based theories @xcite , the semiclassical thomas - fermi method @xcite , or relativistic nuclear field theories solved at the mean - field level @xcite or beyond @xcite .",
    "the coupling constants of the theory must reproduce the bulk properties of nuclear matter at saturation density , @xmath7 ( energy density of @xmath8 ) .",
    "these are the binding energy @xmath9 , effective nucleon mass @xmath10 , incompressibility @xmath11 , and the symmetry energy @xmath12 whose respective values are @xmath13 of the five , the value for the incompressibility of nuclear matter carries some uncertainty .",
    "its value is currently believed to lie in the range between about 180 and 300  mev . at the densities in the interior of neutron stars , the neutron chemical potential , @xmath14 , exceeds the mass ( modified by interactions ) of various members of the baryon octet @xcite .",
    "so in addition to nucleons and electrons , neutron stars may be expected to have populations of hyperons , i.e. @xmath15 and eventually of @xmath16 s .",
    "once the reaction @xmath17 becomes possible in a neutron star , it becomes energetically advantageous for the star to replace the fermionic electrons with the bosonic @xmath18 mesons .",
    "whether or not this actually happens depends on the mass of the @xmath18 in dense matter . a handle on this",
    "is provided by the @xmath18 kinetic energy spectra extracted from ni+ni collisions at sis energies , measured by the kaos collaboration at gsi @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the kaos data shows that the attraction from nuclear matter may bring the @xmath18 mass down to @xmath19 at @xmath20 . for neutron - rich matter",
    ", the relation @xmath21 was established @xcite , with @xmath22  mev the @xmath18 vacuum mass .",
    "values around @xmath23 lie in the vicinity of the electron chemical potential , @xmath24 , in neutron star matter @xcite so that the threshold condition for the onset of @xmath18 condensation , @xmath25 , which follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : kaon.1 ] ) , could be fulfilled in the cores of neutron stars .",
    "the situation is illustrated graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : kmass ] . equation ( [ eq : kaon.1 ] ) is followed by @xmath26 with the neutrinos leaving the star . by this conversion",
    "the nucleons in the cores of newly formed neutron stars can become half neutrons and half protons , which lowers the energy per baryon of the matter @xcite . the relatively isospin symmetric composition achieved in this way resembles the one of atomic nuclei , which are made up of roughly equal numbers of neutrons and protons .",
    "neutron stars are therefore referred to , in this picture , as nucleon stars .",
    "the maximal possible mass of this type of star , where eq .",
    "( [ eq : npk.1 ] ) has gone to completion , has been calculated to be between about @xmath27 @xcite and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "based on the former mass value , brown et al .",
    "studied in a recent paper the formation and evolution of black holes in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "meson condensates can soften the equation of state  ( eos ) considerably . as a consequence ,",
    "neutron stars with @xmath18 condensates can be rather dense and , therefore , have radii smaller than neutron stars without condensates , i.e. @xmath29  km .",
    "an interesting candidate of such a small - radius object may be the nearby neutron star rxj  185  6353754 @xcite",
    "whose radius could be as small as @xmath30  km @xcite .",
    "a novel particle that could make its appearance in the center of a neutron star is the so - called h - dibaryon , a doubly strange six - quark composite with spin and isospin zero , and baryon number two @xcite . since its first prediction in 1977",
    ", the h - dibaryon has been the subject of many theoretical and experimental studies as a possible candidate for a strongly bound exotic state . in neutron stars , which may contain a significant fraction of @xmath31 hyperons ,",
    "the @xmath31 s could combine to form h - dibaryons , which could give way to the formation of h - matter at densities somewhere between @xmath32 @xcite and @xmath33 @xcite , depending on the in - medium properties of the h - dibaryon .",
    "h - matter could thus exist in the cores of moderately dense neutron stars . in @xcite",
    "it was pointed out that h - dibaryons with a vacuum mass of about 2.2  gev and a moderately attractive potential in the medium of about @xmath34  mev could go into a bose condensate in the cores of neutron stars if the limiting star mass is about that of the hulse  taylor pulsar psr  1913 + 16 , @xmath35 .",
    "conversely , if the medium potential were moderately repulsive , around @xmath36  mev , the formation of h - dibaryons may only take place in heavier neutron stars of mass @xmath37 .",
    "if formed , however , h - matter may not remain dormant in neutron stars but , because of its instability against compression could trigger the conversion of neutron stars into hypothetical strange stars @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested already back in the 1970 s by a number of researchers  @xcite that , because of the extreme densities reached in the cores of neutron stars , neutrons protons plus the heavier constitutes ( @xmath38 ) can melt , creating the quark - gluon plasma state being sought at the most powerful terrestrial heavy - ion colliders at cern [ i.e. experiments na35 na44 , na45 , ceres , and na50 ; in a few years at the lhc by the alice experiment ] and rhic . at present one",
    "does not know from experiment at what density the expected phase transition to quark matter occurs , and one has no conclusive guide yet from lattice qcd simulations . from simple geometrical considerations",
    "it follows that nuclei begin to touch each other at densities of @xmath39 , which , for a characteristic nucleon radius of @xmath40  fm , is less than twice the baryon number density @xmath41 of ordinary nuclear matter @xcite . above this density , therefore , is appears plausible that the nuclear boundaries of hadrons dissolve so that the formerly confined quarks now populate free states outside of the hadrons .",
    "depending on rotational frequency and stellar mass , densities as large as two to three times @xmath41 are easily surpassed in the cores of neutron stars , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ec1445fig ] , so that the neutrons and protons in the centers of neutron stars may have been broken up into their    constituent quarks by gravity @xcite .",
    "more than that , since the mass of the strange quark is only @xmath42  mev , high - energetic up and down quarks are expected to readily transform to strange quarks at about the same density at which up and down quark deconfinement sets in @xcite .",
    "three flavor quark matter could thus exist as a permanent component of matter in the centers of neutron stars @xcite . as we shall see in section  [ sec : signal ] , radio astronomers may be able to spot evidence for the existence of this novel phase of matter in the timing structure of pulsar spin - down @xcite .",
    "very recently it was discovered that instantons may cause strong correlations between up and down quarks , which could give way to the existence of colored diquark pairs in superdense matter @xcite .",
    "these pairs could form a bose condensate in cold ( @xmath43  mev ) and dense ( @xmath44 ) quark matter .",
    "moreover , the condensate ought to exhibit color superconductivity @xcite .",
    "both the magnitude of the gap and the critical temperature associated with the color superconductive phase were estimated to be on the order of @xmath45  mev @xcite !",
    "the implications of such tremendous gaps for the magnetic fields of pulsars and their thermal evolution were explored in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "future theoretical studies of qcd at finite baryon number density may reveal to which extent these newly established features of quark matter will have their correspondence in a more complete treatment of qcd at finite baryon number density .",
    "they may also shed light on whether or not a diquark condensate could possibly alter the equation of state  of neutron star matter sufficiently strongly so that one may expect distinguishing features in the global properties of neutron stars , too .",
    "so far we have assumed that quark matter forms a state of matter higher in energy than atomic nuclei .",
    "this most ` plausible ' assumption , however , may be quite deceiving @xcite because for a collection of more than a few hundred @xmath46 quarks , the energy per baryon ( @xmath9 ) of quark matter can be just as well _ below _ the energy of the most stable atomic nucleus , @xmath47 , whose energy per baryon number is @xmath48  mev , with @xmath49 the mass of the @xmath50fe atom .",
    "a simple estimate indicates that for strange quark matter @xmath51 , so that bag constants of @xmath52 ( i.e. @xmath53  mev ) and @xmath54 ( @xmath55  mev ) place the energy per baryon of such matter at @xmath56  mev and 915  mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "obviously , these values correspond to quark matter which is absolutely bound with respect to @xmath50fe . in this event",
    "the ground state of the strong interaction would be strange quark matter ( strange matter ) , made up of @xmath46 quarks , instead of nuclear matter .",
    "this finding is one of the most startling predictions of modern physics with far - reaching implications for neutron stars , for all hadronic stellar configurations in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] would then be only metastable with respect to a stars made up of absolutely stable 3-flavor strange quark matter @xcite . if this is indeed the case , and if it is possible for neutron matter to tunnel to quark matter in at least some neutron stars , then in appears likely that all neutron stars would in fact be strange stars @xcite .",
    "in sharp contrast to the other stars in fig .  [",
    "fig : cross ] , which are made up of hadronic matter , possibly in phase equilibrium with quarks , strange stars consist nearly entirely of pure 3-flavor quark matter , eventually enveloped in a thin nuclear crust whose density is less than neutron drip ( @xmath57 ) @xcite .",
    "the hypothetical , absolute stability of strange matter gives way to a variety of novel stable strange matter objects which stretch from strangelets at the small baryon number end , @xmath58 , to strange stars at the high end , @xmath59 , where strange matter becomes unstable against gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "the strange counterparts of ordinary atomic nuclei are the strange nuggets , searched for in high - energy collisions at brookhaven ( e.g. e858 , e864 , e878 , e882-b , e886 , e896-a ) , cern ( newmass experiment na52 ) , balloon - borne experiments ( crash ) , and terrestrial experiments ( e.g. hadron ) @xcite .",
    "( for a recent review , see @xcite . )",
    "strange stars should possess properties that may allow one to distinguish them from their ` conventional ' counterparts @xcite .",
    "since neutron stars are objects of highly compressed matter , the geometry of spacetime is changed considerably from flat space .",
    "neutron star models are thus to be constructed from einstein s field equations of general relativity ( @xmath60=0,1,2,3 ) , @xmath61 which couples einstein s curvature tensor , @xmath62 , to the energy ",
    "momentum density tensor , @xmath63 , of the stellar matter .",

    "theories of superdense matter enter in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intro.1 ] ) via @xmath63 , which contains the equation of state , @xmath66 , of the stellar matter .",
    "it is derivable from a given stellar - matter lagrangian @xmath67 @xcite . in general",
    ", @xmath68 is a complicated function of the numerous hadron and quark fields , collectively written as @xmath69 , that acquire finite amplitudes up to the highest densities reached in the cores of compact stars . according to what has been said in section  [ sec : faces ] , plausible candidates for @xmath70 are the charged states of the su(3 ) baryon octet , @xmath71 @xcite , the charged states of the @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath72 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite mesons , as well as the @xmath73 quark fields @xcite .",
    "the conditions of chemical equilibrium and electric charge neutrality of the stellar matter require the presence of leptons too , in which case @xmath74 .",
    "models for the equation of state  then follow according to the scheme ( for details , see @xcite ) @xmath75 in general , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : intro.1 ] ) and ( [ eq : intro.2 ] ) were to be solved simultaneously since the particles move in curved spacetime whose geometry , determined by einstein s field equations , is coupled to the total mass energy @xmath76 of the matter . in the case of neutron stars , however , the long - range gravitational forces can be cleanly separated from the short - range forces , so that eqs.([eq : intro.1 ] ) and ( [ eq : intro.2 ] ) constitute two decouple problems .",
    "the structure equation of spherical neutron stars has been derived from einstein s equation ( [ eq : intro.1 ] ) first by tolman @xcite , and oppenheimer and volkoff @xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath77 and is known in the literature as the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation , applicable to stellar configurations in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we use units for which the gravitational constant and velocity of light are @xmath78 so that the mass of the sun is @xmath79 km .",
    "the mass @xmath80 contained in a sphere of radius @xmath81 is given by @xmath82 .",
    "hence the star s total mass follows as @xmath83 .",
    "the stellar equations describing rotating compact stars are considerably more complicated than those of non - rotating compact stars @xcite .",
    "these complications have their cause in the deformation of rotating stars plus the general relativistic effect of the dragging of local inertial frames .",
    "this reflects itself in a metric of the form @xcite @xmath84 where each metric function , i.e. @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , depends on the radial coordinate @xmath81 , polar angle @xmath89 , and implicitly on the star s angular velocity @xmath90 .",
    "the quantity @xmath91 denotes the angular velocity of the local inertial frames , which are dragged along in the direction of the star s rotation .",
    "this frequency too depends on @xmath81 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "of particular interest is the relative frame dragging frequency @xmath92 defined as @xmath93 , which typically increases from about 15% at the surface to about 60% at the center of a neutron star that rotates at its kepler frequency @xcite .",
    "the kepler frequency , @xmath94 , is the maximum frequency a star can have before mass loss ( mass shedding ) at the equator sets in .",
    "it sets an absolute upper limit on stable rapid rotation . in classical mechanics the expression for @xmath94 , determined by the equality between centrifuge and gravity , is readily obtained as @xmath95 .",
    "its general relativistic counterpart is given by @xcite @xmath96 the primes denote derivatives with respect to the schwarzschild radial coordinate . equation ( [ eq : okgr ] ) is to be evaluated self - consistently together with einstein s field equations ( [ eq : intro.1 ] ) for a given model for the equation of state .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows @xmath94 as a function of rotating star mass .",
    "the rectangle indicates both the approximate range of observed neutron star masses as well as the observed rotational periods which , currently , are @xmath97 ms .",
    "one sees that    all pulsars so far observed rotate below the mass shedding frequency and so can be interpreted as rotating neutron stars .",
    "half - millisecond periods or even smaller ones are completely excluded for neutron stars of mass @xmath98 @xcite for these equations of state  @xcite .",
    "the situation appears to be very different for neutron stars made up of self - bound strange quark matter , the so - called strange stars introduced in section  [ ssec : ss ] .",
    "such stars appear to withstand stable rotation against mass shedding down to rotational periods in the half - millisecond regime or even less @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , the possible future discovery of a single sub - millisecond pulsar , say 0.5  ms , could give a strong hint that , firstly , strange stars actually exist and , secondly , the deconfined , self - bound phase of 3-flavor strange quark matter is the true ground state of the strong interaction rather than nuclear matter .",
    "this conclusion is strengthened by the finding of @xcite that young strange stars appear not to be subject to the recently discovered @xmath81-mode instability , which would slow down hot neutron stars to periods of several milliseconds via the emission of gravitational radiation within a year after birth .",
    "figure [ fig : mrad2 ] exhibits the mass of non - rotating neutron stars as a function of star radius .",
    "each stellar sequence is shown up to the maximum - mass star , indicated by tick marks .",
    "stars beyond the mass peak are unstable against radial oscillations and would collapse to black holes .",
    "evidently , all equations of state  can accommodate a neutron star as heavy as the hulse - taylor pulsar , whose mass is very precisely known to be @xmath99 .",
    "rather heavy neutron stars , on the other had , of mass @xmath100 can only be obtained for equations of state  that exhibit a rather stiff behavior at supernuclear densities ( cf .",
    "[ fig : eos ] ) .",
    "knowledge of the maximum - mass value is of great importance for two reasons .",
    "firstly , about 20 neutron stars masses are presently known @xcite , and the largest of these imposes a lower bound on the maximum mass of a theoretical model .",
    "the current lower bound on the maximum - mass is about @xmath101 ( i.e. neutron star 4u090040 ) , which , if firmly established , would indicate that the equation of state  of superdense matter will be rather soft at supernuclear densities .",
    "this would change if the maximum - mass should be closer to the upper bound of @xmath102 .",
    "indications for the possible existence of such heavy neutron stars , with masses around @xmath103 , may come from the observation of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in luminosity in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) @xcite .",
    "if confirmed , a significant fraction of equations of state  presently discussed in the literature @xcite could be ruled out . because of the significant stiffness of the eos required by heavy neutron stars , all the phase transitions reviewed in section [ sec : faces ] , which imply generally a softening of the eos rather than a stiffening , appear to be unfavored if not completely ruled out . in this event neutron star matter were likely to be made up of chemically equilibrated nucleons only @xcite .",
    "rapid neutron star rotation increases the non - rotating maximum mass value by at most 25% @xcite , so that even extremely rapidly spinning neutron stars can not have masses significantly above @xmath104 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the second reason is that the maximum mass can be useful in identifying black hole candidates @xcite .",
    "for example , if the mass of a compact companion of an optical star is determined to exceed the maximum mass of a neutron star , it must be a black hole . because the    maximum mass of stable neutron stars in our theory is @xmath105 , compact companions being more massive than that value",
    "are predicted to be black holes .",
    "an example of such an object is the non - pulsating x - ray binary cyg  x1 , as its mass lies in the range @xmath106 .",
    "as pointed out in section [ ssec : deconf ] , the possibility of quark deconfinement in the cores of neutron stars has already been suggested in the 1970 s .",
    "however until recently no stringent observational signal has ever    1.00 cm    been proposed .",
    "this is so because whether or not the quark - hadron phase transition occurs in neutron stars makes only little difference to their static properties such as the range of possible masses , radii , or even their limiting rotational periods .",
    "this , however , turns out to be strikingly different for the timing structure of rotating neutron stars ( i.e. pulsars ) that develop quark matter cores in the course of spin - down , as i shall describe in this section .    a model of an eos which accounts for quark deconfinement in neutron star matter",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkeos ] .",
    "one reads off that the transition of confined hadronic matter to quark matter sets in at about twice nuclear matter density ( arrow labeled ` a ' ) , which leads to a pronounced softening of the eos .",
    "pure quark matter exists at densities @xmath107 ( arrow labeled ` b ' ) .",
    "these structures manifest themselves inside rotating neutron stars as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : freq.eq ] and [ fig : freq.po ] ( non - rotating star mass is @xmath108 ) .",
    "the stars baryon number is kept constant during spin - down from the kepler frequency to zero rotation , which describes the temporal evolution of an isolated rotating neutron star .",
    "depending on frequency , the star has an inner sphere of pure quark matter ( labeled ` quark ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq.eq ] ) surrounded by a few kilometers thick shell of mixed phase of hadronic and quark matter arranged in a coulomb lattice structure , and this surrounded by a thin shell of hadronic liquid , itself with a thin crust of heavy ions .",
    "the lattice structure of varying geometry may have dramatic effects on pulsar observables including transport properties and the theory of glitches @xcite . as the star spins up",
    "it becomes more and more deformed , and the central density decreases .",
    "for some rotating neutron stars the    mass and initial rotational frequency may be just such that the central density rises from below to above the critical density for dissolution of baryons into their quark constituents .",
    "this is accompanied by a sudden shrinkage of the neutron star , which occurs for the present model star at @xmath109 .",
    "this effects the star s moment of inertia , @xmath110 , dramatically .",
    "changes of @xmath110 , in turn , reflect themselves in the braking index , @xmath3 , of a pulsar , which is given by @xmath111 @xcite , @xmath112 one sees that the braking index depends explicitly and implicitly on @xmath90 .",
    "the right side reduces to the canonical constant @xmath113 only if @xmath110 is independent of frequency .",
    "figure [ fig : nvso ] shows the variation of @xmath3 with frequency for the star discussed just above ( i.e. figs .  [ fig : freq.eq ] and [ fig : freq.po ] ) as well as the sample star of @xcite .",
    "because of the change in the moment of inertia driven by the transition into quark matter , the braking index deviates dramatically from 3 at the transition frequencies . for the star of figs .",
    "[ fig : freq.eq ] and [ fig : freq.po ] , this occurs at @xmath109 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the solid curve shows the case of a strong deconfinement transition at @xmath114 discussed in @xcite .",
    "continuously connected intermediate cases are possible too and were discussed in @xcite .",
    "such dramatic anomalies in @xmath115 are not known to be exhibited by conventional neutron stars , because their moments of inertia increase smoothly with @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the radio astronomical observation of such an anomaly may thus be interpreted as a signal for the development of quark - matter cores in the centers of pulsars !    as a very important subject on this issue , we estimate the duration    over which the braking index is anomalous .",
    "it can be estimated from @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the frequency interval of the anomaly . for a millisecond pulsar",
    "whose period derivative is typically @xmath118 , one finds @xmath119  years .",
    "the dipole age of such pulsars is about @xmath120  years .",
    "so as a rough estimate we may expect that about 10% of the @xmath121 solitary millisecond pulsars presently known , are in the transition epoch and so could be signaling the ongoing process of quark deconfinement , complementing the searches for the quark - gluon plasma state at the terrestrial heavy - ion colliders .",
    "the predominant cooling mechanism of hot ( temperatures of several @xmath122  k ) newly formed neutron stars immediately after formation is neutrino emission , with an initial cooling time scale of seconds .",
    "already a few minutes after birth , the internal neutron star temperature drops to @xmath123  k @xcite .",
    "photon emission overtakes neutrinos only when the internal temperature has fallen to @xmath124  k , with a corresponding surface temperature roughly two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "neutrino cooling dominates for at least the first @xmath125 years , and typically for much longer in standard cooling ( modified urca ) calculations .",

    ", theoretical cooling calculations , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool ] , too provide most valuable information about the interior matter and neutron star structure .",
    "the stellar cooling tracks in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool ] are computed for a broad collection of equations of state  @xcite , including those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] , which account for the effects mentioned just above . knowing the thermal evolution of a neutron star also yields information about such temperature - sensitive properties as transport coefficients , transition to superfluid states , crust solidification , and internal pulsar heating mechanisms such as frictional dissipation at the crust - superfluid interfaces ( for a recent overview , see @xcite ) .",
