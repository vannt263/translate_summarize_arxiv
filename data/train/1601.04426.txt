    "this picture is in good agreement both with @xmath4 symmetry of the strong interaction and the quark - gluon structure of the proton  @xcite .",
    "the constituent quarks play the roles of incident particles in terms of which @xmath0 scattering is described in aqm .    in the case of inelastic @xmath0 collisions the secondary particles are produced in aqm in one or several @xmath5 collisions , so it opens the possibility to investigate inclusive densities of the secondaries produced in the single @xmath5 collision at the different initial energies .",
    "after that we can calculate the central inclusive densities in @xmath2 collisions without any new parameters .",
    "elastic amplitudes for large energy @xmath6 and small momentum transfer @xmath7 are dominated by pomeron exchange .",

    "it is worth to emphasize that the @xmath5 interaction is described here by single effective pomeron exchange between each @xmath5 pair .",
    "generally it may include the contributions of several gribov bare pomerons @xcite and the parameters of the effective pomeron could be different from those of the bare pomerons . at the same time the one quark interaction with the two different target quarks is mediated by the exchange of the two effective pomerons . in this respect",
    "there is a close resemblance between the nucleon - nucleon scattering in aqm and the nucleus - nucleus scattering in glauber theory .",
    "the @xmath5 interaction plays the same role in the first case as the @xmath17 interaction in the second .",
    "the elastic @xmath0 scattering amplitude ( or @xmath1 scattering amplitude , here we do not distinguish between the two ) is basically expressed as @xmath18 in this formula @xmath19 , is the initial proton wave function in terms of the quarks transverse momenta @xmath20 , while @xmath21 is the wavefunction of the scattered proton .",
