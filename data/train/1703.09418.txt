    "our mind and body is a manifestation of complex dynamics of electric impulses that carry information and trigger reactions in different organs of our body .",
    "the pulses of electrical excitation in heart are responsible for starting a chain of reactions , resulting in contraction of the cardiac muscle , causing the blood circulation .",
    "understanding the detailed mechanisms of formation and propagation of electrical excitation can help in treatment and prevention of cardiac diseases .",
    "the direct experimentation with living systems is difficult and rises many ethical issues , hence a mathematical description provides a valuable tool to gain insight and understanding of the internal working of the heart .",
    "the elementary part of a cardiac excitation model are models of the ion - specific channel in the membrane , that close or open in response to the change in the transmembrane voltage . on the molecular scale , functioning of a single channel",
    "is an inherently stochastic process , which is adequately described as continuous time markov chain ( or markov processes , as they are sometimes called ) . for most applications , however , the stochastic component is not essential , and it is sufficient to describe the behaviour of the channel in terms of the deterministic `` master equation '' for the probabilities of the channel to be in certain states , as functions of time .",
    "simulation of resulting excitation models for single cells does not create problems ; but when scaled to the tissue or whole - organ level , this becomes computationally expensive .",
    "it is therefore imporant to try and improve the computational methods for simulation of cardiac excitation models .",
    "one significant factor of computational complexity is that the markov chain models of ionic channels often involve processes on time scales differing by several orders of magnitude , i.e. are stiff .",
    "hence a direct approach using explicit time steppers requires very small time steps , hence high computational demands .",
    "the natural alternative is generic implicit time steppers .",
    "however , approaches based on exploiting specific properties of cardiac excitation model present an attractive third possibility . in this paper",
    ", we explore one possible way to exploit specific properties of the markov chain models of ionic channels .",
    "this is based on the traditional idea that a small parameter in the model can be turned from a hindrance into an advantage , by finding asymptotics in this parameter . for small parameters responsible for numerical stiffness ,",
    "the adequate approach is singular perturbation theory , of fast - slow asymptotics .",

    "the detailed derivation is presented in the appendix  [ sec : reduct - comp ] .",
    "the final result reads as the following system of odes    [ eq : split - ode ] @xmath25    where in the right - hand side of the first equation we have kept the leading order term , @xmath26 , and the first - order correction @xmath27 , which works out as @xmath28 where @xmath29{0pt}{4ex}\\right|_{\\vu = \\vu } } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    equations  ( [ eq : split - ode - a ] ) and ( [ eq : split - ode - b ] ) are coupled through higher - order terms , and to complete the reduction , we need to eliminate @xmath30 . for the solution of the manifold coordinates @xmath31 up to @xmath32",
    "it is sufficient to find the correction term @xmath30 up to @xmath33 .",
    "the leading order term for the correction @xmath30 in terms of @xmath31 can be found by solving using the integrating factor method .",

    "in reality , the matrix @xmath38 depends on other dynamic variables of the model , e.g. the transmembrane voltage , which in turn are affected by the dynamics of the markov chain ; however this is not essential for the formalism we describe here and we assume that @xmath38 is an explicit function of time , just for simplicity of notation .",

    "i.e. _  it is a _",
    "stochastic vector_. this implies that the sum of the entries in each column of the transition matrix @xmath38 has to be equal to @xmath40 .",
    "this is achieved as the entries on the diagonal of the transition matrix are a sum of the entries out of the diagonal for each column of the matrix .",
    "this property together with the fact that the non - diagonal elements are non - negative constitutes the definition of @xmath38 as a _ left - stochastic matrix_.    to use the theory described in section  [ sec : dim - red ] we have to take into account one simplifying fact and two complications .",
    "the simplifying fact is that the system ( [ eq : mc - ode ] ) is linear .",
    "the complications are , firstly , that the theory described in the previous section applies to an autonomous system , but the markov chain in has an explicit time dependence of the transition matrix @xmath41 .",
    "secondly , the theory requires a small parameter , however the markov chain models contain transition rates determined experimentally , and identifiction of any small parameters in such a case is a separate task , sometimes nontrivial .",
    "the first complication is dealt with using autonomisation , which means that we introduce an additional dynamical variable @xmath42 to represent time ( henceforth referred to as _",
    "`` autonomous time '' _ ) . then the vector of dynamical variables is @xmath43 and the dynamic equation is @xmath44    to adress the second complication , we introduce the small parameters artificially in an empirical procedure we call parametric embedding , which is discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "for now it is important that as a result , we can split the transition rates matrix @xmath38 into a fast part @xmath45 and a slow part @xmath46 , and the difference between them is identified by the small parameter @xmath2 appearing as @xmath47 we restrict consideration to the embeddings in which @xmath45 and @xmath46 are left - stochastic matrices .",

    "correspondingly , we introduce also the left eigenvectors @xmath55 , @xmath56 differentiation of the last identity with respect to @xmath42 yields a relationship that will be useful : @xmath57    we transform the system into fast time @xmath58 to get a system @xmath59 this can be considered in the format of ( [ eq : ode - def ] ) with @xmath60 the dimensionality of the autonomized system ( [ eq : aut - emb - mc ] ) is @xmath61 ; we keep the upper value of the corresponding indices as @xmath62 but reserve the value @xmath63 for the time variable @xmath42 ; this is where @xmath64 in  table  [ tab : eig - indices ] becomes @xmath40 .",

    "if the limit @xmath111 is concerned then we call it an",
    "_ asymptotic embedding_.    the typical use of this procedure has the form of a replacement of a small constant with a small parameter .",
    "if a system contains a dimensionless constant @xmath112 which is `` much smaller than 1 '' , then replacement of @xmath112 with @xmath113 constitutes a 1-parametric embedding ; and then the limit @xmath114 can be considered . in practice , constant @xmath112 would more often be replaced with parameter @xmath2 rather than multiplied by it , but mathematically speaking , in the context of @xmath114 and @xmath115 , these two ways are formally equivalent .",
    "_ this explains the paradoxical use of a zero limit for a parameter whose true value is one .",
    "_    in some applications , the `` small parameters '' appear naturally and are readily identified .",

    ", it is important to understand that there are infinitely many ways a given system can be parametrically embedded , as there are infinitely many ways to draw a curve @xmath116 in the functional space given the only constraint that it passes through a given point , @xmath117 . in terms of asymptotics , which of the embeddings is `` better '' depends on the qualitative features of the original systems that need to be represented , or classes of solutions that need to be approximated .",
    "if a numerical solution of the system can be found easily , then there is a simple practical recipe : to look at the solutions of the embedding at different , progressively decreasing values of the artificial small parameter @xmath2 , and see when the features of interest will start to converge .",
    "if the convergent behaviour is satisfactorily similar to the original system with @xmath118 , the embedding is adequate for these features .    to summarize ,",
    "we claim that identification of small parameters in a given mathematical model with experimentally measured functions and constants will , from the formal mathematical viewpoint , always be arbitrary , even though in the simplest cases the choice may be so natural that that this ambiguity is not even realized by the modeller , and that `` validity '' of such identification can be defined only empirically : if the asymptotics describe the required class of solutions sufficiently well .",
    "the exceptions may be when the asymptotic series are in fact convergent , the approximation errors can be estimated _ a priori _ , but this is rare .    in the subsequent text , slightly abusing the above definition for the sake of brevity , we refer as `` embedding '' to particular instances of one - parametric embedding of a given system for a selected value of the parameter @xmath2 .",

    "we have @xmath206 for all @xmath207 so  ( [ eq : red - ml ] ) gives the leading - order transition rate matrix for the reduced model as @xmath208 with the new transition rates defined as @xmath209 these expression use the notation @xmath210 as an abbreviation for @xmath211    the original coordinates are recovered from the reduced one by    @xmath212    as can be seen in  fig .",

    "this was of course to be expected based on the results of the empirical embedding study , as discussed above .",

    "that is , we consider the transition rates between @xmath214 and @xmath176 as fast , which will lead to the merger of these two states into a new state @xmath215 .",
    "so in the context of the present section , the `` original model '' is defined by the matrix  ( [ eq : stu - m0 ] ) , which will now be called @xmath216 , while the fast matrix in the new embedding is @xmath217 and the slow matrix is @xmath218 acting as before , we find the right eigenvectors of @xmath219 corresponding to zero eigenvalue as @xmath220 the corresponding left eigenvectors as @xmath221 and we set the names of the components of the reduced vector as @xmath222\\t .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the resulting leading - order reduced matrix works out as @xmath223 with the new transition rates defined by @xmath224 where @xmath225        fig .",
    "[ fig : ap - red ] presents the results of the @xmath226-@xmath213 in addition to the previoiusly considered @xmath135 and @xmath213 reductions .",
    "this was done in simulations where the full original model and the three reduced version were run in the same protocol , which included stimulation with a period of one second , starting from @xmath227 ( this was done in order to be able to show the time in panel ( a ) in the logarithmic scale ) .",
    "one can see that the reduced models are indistinguishable from the full model except for the upstroke of the action potential .",
    "the upstroke of the fifth action potential is shown in detail in panels ( b ) and ( c ) , for the probability of the @xmath131 channel being open , and the resulting value of this current .",
    "we see that the results generally agree with what could be expected from the empirical embedding studies illustrated in  fig .",
    "[ fig : embeddings ] .",
    "namely , the @xmath135 embedding gives a rather poor approximation , the @xmath226-@xmath213 embedding is slightly better , while @xmath213 is very good .",

    "top diagram shows the @xmath135-reduced model , middle diagram shows @xmath228-reduced model , and bottom diagram shows @xmath229-@xmath228-reduced model . ]",
    "[ fig : diag - tr-1 ] summarises the the markov chain models occurring as a result of the three asymptotics we have considered : this is to be compared with the original scheme shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : diag - tr ] .    asymptotic reduction based on time scale separation can pursue at least two different goals : reducing the number of dynamic equations , and reducing stiffness of those equations .",
    "the reductions considered in this paper are not particularly impressive in terms of reducing the number of equations : we have reduced by maximum of three out of nine , which is even less significant in comparison with the number of other dynamic equations in a typical model of an excitable cell , beyond the markov chain of the @xmath131 channel .",
    "however , our main purpose is the other one : reducing the stiffness . to achieve a simple practical estimate of this characteristic",
    ", we measured the stiffness of the model by the maximum time step size @xmath230 which provides a stable solution using the forward euler solver for the isolated @xmath131 model driven by a recorded action potential .",
    "the original full model allows the time step of about @xmath231 for stable computations ; an increase above that leads to numerical instability . in comparison to that ,",
    "all three models considered allow @xmath232 , _",
    "i.e. _  a rather modest improvement .",
    "the limited progress in this is due to the fact that in all three examples considered , we have included in the embedding only some of the fastest transition rates . and even in these cases",
    ", we have seen that asymptotic removal of some of the fast processes affects the accuracy of computations . even though this effects are seen only during the upstrokes of the action potential , these upstrokes are of principal significance as they determine the conduction velocity in spatially - distributed simulation , and therefore also the more delicate and more important phenomena such as conduction block ,",
    "wavebreaks etc .",
    "hence further increase of the number of the reduced degrees of freedom does not seem to be an answer ( although of course further research is needed to establish that with certainty ) .",
    "an alternative approach , which has proved to be more practical than the one considered here , has been described in our previous works  @xcite , dubbed `` exponential solvers '' .",
    "however , that approach is purely numerical and does not explicitly take into account the fast - slow structure of the model , hence an asymptotic approach seems to have an _ a priori _",
    "advantage , which ought to have been explored .",
    "we hope that the present study fills this gap to a certain extent .",
    "an attractive possibility to improve the accuracy of the asymptotics and hence to open the way to further decrease the number of equations and reduce the stiffness , seems to be using higher - order asymptotics .",
    "we have explored this only in one of the three examples , but it already shows that ( i ) the algebraic complexity of the resulting formulas increases considerably , ( ii ) more significantly , some improvement in accuracy is devalued by the fact that the resulting model , unlike the leading - order asymptotics , no longer behaves as a `` proper '' markov chain : the vector of dynamic variables is not guaranteed to remain stochastic , in particular , it can easily lead to negative values of the state occupancies .",
    "this happens because we have used the asymptotic theory which was designed for generic systems and is not tailored for the specific requirements of markov chains .",
    "hence a possible way for improvement may be in developing higher - order asymptotics strictly within the class of markov chains .",
