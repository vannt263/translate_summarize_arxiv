    "the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction is one of the most basic problems of nuclear physics .",
    "there exists extensive experimental information  from @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering data and the properties of the deuteron  but no single theoretical picture seems to be able to describe the relevant physics for all internuclear distances . in @xmath0-@xmath0 phenomenology ,",
    "both relativistic and non - relativistic , one describes the nucleons as elementary particles interacting through a two - body potential which is either local or includes some nonlocality through momentum - dependence in the interaction .",
    "the general features of that potential , i.e. the short - distance core and the long range attraction , have been known for over forty years .    already in 1935",
    ", yukawa @xcite suggested that the finite range attraction was due to the exchange of an intermediate mass , strongly - interacting particle , the subsequently discovered pion .",
    "this led to the development of meson field - theoretic models which today form the most accurate phenomenological description of the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an excellent overview ) . in these models ,",
    "one treats the nucleons as elementary particles with an empirical form factor , and their interactions are usually carried through one boson exchange ( obe ) plus two pion exchange ( tpe ) , where the tpe is frequently simulated by a ( fictitious ) sigma meson .    within these descriptions ,",
    "the long range ( @xmath1 1.5 fm ) part of the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction is controlled by one pion exchange , while the intermediate range ( 0.5 fm @xmath21.5 fm ) attraction is dominated by obe and tpe . the short range ( @xmath3 0.5 fm ) repulsion is the  mystery \" region in such descriptions .",
    "it has been described by hard or soft cores , or form factors , both of the order of 0.5 - 0.8 fm , or by the exchange of vector mesons which have a range of @xmath4 0.2 fm , a clear inconsistency .",
    "the advent of qcd and quark models has lifted the veil of mystery from the short range @xmath0-@xmath0 problem exposing a new level of simplicity . however , the system is no longer just a two - body , but at least a six - body , entity and more properly a field theoretical problem .",
    "the quark core of nucleons is of the order of 0.7 fm ( an rms radius of 0.5 fm ) and one expects the quark substructure to be effective within a range of @xmath0-@xmath0 separations of up to about 1 fm .    a description of the nucleon - nucleon interaction within the framework of quark degrees of freedom has been the subject of much research .",
    "the ideal venture would be a lattice gauge theory calculation @xcite , but we are quite far from that stage , and therefore we have to rely on modeling .",
    "we mention , non - exhaustively , several different avenues which have been explored in that context : non - relativistic constituent quark ( potential ) models @xcite , relativistic current quark models as , for example , the mit bag model @xcite and various soliton models @xcite , string models and the topological skyrme model @xcite .",
    "there are many varieties under each category , and we will not attempt to review them all here , but rather recommend the reader to the articles by oka and yazaki @xcite , myhrer and wroldsen @xcite or shimizu @xcite .",
    "in addition to the various anstze which have been employed to model quark - quark interactions , one has to further distinguish between static and dynamical calculations . in the static calculations ,",
    "a local @xmath0-@xmath0 potential is obtained in born - oppenheimer @xcite ( adiabatic ) approximation from the energy difference of a deformed six quark bag and two separated nucleons .",
    "non - adiabatic calculations yield a non - local @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction through a consideration of the dynamics involved . in the latter category ,",
    "usually the resonating group @xcite or the generator coordinate method @xcite are applied .",
    "quark models hold promise to give a good description for short and intermediate range , but beyond , say , 1 fm the interaction , although in principle describable in terms of quarks , is much more easily represented by mesonic models , with the nucleonic substructure giving rise to form factors for the meson - nucleon couplings .",
    "the ultimate object of our study is not only to reproduce the two - body data , such as @xmath0-@xmath0 phase shifts and bound state properties of the deuteron , but also to quantify the quark substructure of nuclei . with respect to the latter",
    ", we will describe the collision process as an act of fusion followed by a separation into three - quark clusters , and this will be used in conjunction with the independent pair model of nuclei to obtain quark structure functions .",
    "the main aspects of our current project can be described as follows :    \\1 ) we employ the chromo - dielectric soliton model @xcite , which respects covariance , contains absolute color confinement and is free of the color van der waals problem @xcite ( which is inherent to most non - relativistic calculations ) .",
    "in addition , one gluon exchange is evaluated with a confined gluonic propagator .",
    "\\2 ) the six - quark wave function is expanded in terms of  molecular \" states @xcite , including all configurations based on the two lowest spatial single particle states .",
    "this allows for inclusion of basis states normally omitted in cluster model calculations , and which have been demonstrated to be important in decreasing the upper bound in variational calculations @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) dynamics will be handled through the generator coordinate method @xcite , which leads to a set of coupled integral equations .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that a significant part of the short - range repulsion is due to dynamics , and the absence of a repulsive core in some early calculations is now seen as an artifact of the adiabatic approximation @xcite .",
    "in addition , the effective interaction is non - local in terms of the @xmath0-@xmath0 separation parameter .",
    "\\4 ) in order to reproduce two - body properties , we will attach the interaction we derive to a phenomenological local obe potential beyond a certain internuclear distance .",
    "we could , however , also consider extending our calculation more deeply into the obe intermediate range region by including quantum surface fluctuations and introducing configurations of the form @xmath5 in addition to our @xmath6 basis states .",
    "in this first of a series of papers , we are mostly concerned with the introduction of the model and a presentation of the formalism we use .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to an adiabatic , or static , approximation .",
    "we calculate @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the separation or deformation parameter , including diagonalization with respect to the various six - quark configurations .",
    "we defer steps ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) to subsequent papers in this series @xcite .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review the chromo - dielectric soliton model , which in sec .",
    "iii is used to generate single quark wave functions by means of a constrained mean field calculation .",
    "iv is devoted to the  molecular \" states which form the basis for the six quark configurations we consider .",
    "v describes the treatment of one gluon exchange and in sec .",
    "vi we present the results of our numerical calculations . finally , we summarize , conclude and give an outlook on our future work in sec . vii .",
    "the chromo - dielectric model @xcite is an evolution of the friedberg - lee non - topological soliton model @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian is the same as the fundamental qcd lagrangian , supplemented by a scalar field @xmath9 which is assumed to simulate the gluonic condensate and other scalar structures which inhabit the complicated physical vacuum .",
    "it is assumed that the scalar field , which has a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath10 , parameterizes the bulk of the non - perturbative effects which arise due to the non - linearity of qcd .",
    "it furthermore governs the chromo - dielectric properties of the medium .",
    "the model lagrangian is covariant and , for massless quarks , satisfies chiral symmetry .",
    "it differs in that respect from most effective quark models  such as the mit @xcite , friedberg - lee , or nielsen - patkos @xcite models  which explicitly violate chiral symmetry through the interaction of the quarks with some scalar field .",
    "although the model has its basis in qcd , we regard it as phenomenological",
    ".    the extra degrees of freedom introduced by the scalar field are redundant . in order to avoid double counting",
    "we do not include diagrams which correspond to structures with the quantum numbers of the @xmath9 field .",
    "since the model parameters are readjusted at each level of approximation to fit key physical data , one might hope that as the level of sophistication of the calculations is increased , one would find a decoupling of the @xmath9 degrees of freedom and would thus be left with pure qcd .",
    "but , we are currently far from that stage of sophistication .",
    "we treat the gluons in the abelian approximation , which is consistent with one gluon exchange .",
    "the primary role of the @xmath9 field is then to mediate the chromo - dielectric function , @xmath11 , which , in turn , is designed to guarantee absolute color confinement . the scalar field",
    ", therefore , not only simulates the non - linear and non - perturbative effects , but it also parameterizes the color - dielectric properties of the space - time continuum .",
    "the model lagrangian density is given by @xmath12 with    @xmath13    here , @xmath14 is the current quark mass matrix and , since there is no direct coupling between the quarks and the @xmath9-field , the lagrangian is chirally invariant for massless quarks . for the rest of this investigation we thus set @xmath15 .",
    "the gauge field tensor is given by @xmath16 where the @xmath17 are the su(3 ) structure constants .",
    "@xmath18 is the self - interaction energy of the scalar field and is taken to be of the form @xmath19 the quartic form of @xmath18 would assure renormalizability _ if @xmath20 were a constant_. although this is convenient , it is not demanded since we are already dealing with an effective theory .",
    "the bag pressure @xmath21 ( which corresponds to the  bag constant \" of the mit model ) is a function of the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 and is chosen such that @xmath18 has a minimum and vanishes at the value @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "we define @xmath26 where @xmath27 is identified with the mass of the lowest @xmath28 glueball state . in order to guarantee absolute color confinement and a regular behavior as @xmath29 ,",
    "the dielectric function must further satisfy @xmath30 we choose the form ( with @xmath31 ) @xmath32 and set @xmath33 for our present investigation .",
    "although the quarks are massless and there is no direct quark - sigma coupling , they still acquire a self - energy  and hence an effective mass  through their interactions with the gluon field .",
    "furthermore , the gluonic propagator depends on @xmath9 through @xmath11 and is thus also  confined \" .",
    "this confinement mechanism has been studied for two particular cases : ( 1 ) a uniform dielectric function @xcite and ( 2 ) a cavity model in which @xmath20 is unity at the center and goes to zero outside the bag @xcite .    in the preliminary discussion @xcite employing a uniform dielectric",
    ", confinement was exhibited explicitly from a calculation of the quark self - energy in the limit of very heavy , i.e. fixed , quarks . in calculations with zero mass quarks @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the quarks acquire a  dynamic \" mass below some critical @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding self - energy displays an asymptotic form which increases as @xmath20 decreases and becomes infinite as @xmath35 .",
    "this corresponds to a realization of _ spatial confinement _ , since this mass is  color blind . \"",
    "it was shown that a massless goldstone pion arises as a direct consequence of spatial confinement , and that the successful cloudy bag model emerges quite naturally in this formalism .",
    "the resulting quark propagator exhibits momentum dependence and hence non - locality .    _ color confinement _",
    ", on the other hand , arises through the enclosure of the quark cavity by the physical vacuum where the dielectric function goes to zero .",
    "the gluon field energy is thus infinite if the quark structure in the cavity is not in a color singlet state .",
    "note that @xmath36 also ensures that there are no spurious color van der waals forces @xcite since then the stress - energy tensor vanishes in the vacuum . in a study",
    "@xcite employing a cavity model , the non - local quark propagator was calculated by solving the schwinger - dyson equation .",
    "we utilize the results of these studies and introduce an effective quark mass which is designed to simulate spatial confinement .",
    "we thus add an _ effective coupling _ between the quarks and the scalar field .",
    "this destroys chiral invariance ( which , in turn , is restored by the emergence of the goldstone pion ) .",
    "the form of the added term is @xmath37 with @xmath38 motivated by comparison with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . it turns out , however , that the exact form of that coupling term does not seem to be too important .",
    "color confinement is realized by incorporating one gluon exchange ( oge ) matrix elements both for the quark self - energy and for the mutual interaction terms .",
    "since we work in the coulomb ( or transverse ) gauge , where @xmath39 , the time component @xmath40 , which is responsible for color confinement , is instantaneous and frequency - independent .",
    "the effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 \\ , + \\ , \\beta \\ , g_{eff}\\bigl(\\sigma({\\bf r})\\bigr ) \\ , & + & \\ ,   { \\scriptstyle{1\\over 4 } } g_s \\ , \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\lambda$}^c \\ , a_0^c({\\bf r } ) \\big\\}\\psi({\\bf r } ) \\\\   & + & \\ , { \\scriptstyle{1\\over 2 } } \\ !",

    "this must be supplemented by the field equations for @xmath40 and @xmath46 , to be given in sec .",
    "v.    in order to fit the five parameters of the chromo - dielectric soliton model , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath23 in @xmath18 , @xmath49 in @xmath50 and the strong coupling constant @xmath51 , we construct self - consistent solutions for the nucleon . employing the coherent state approximation",
    ", we treat the scalar field classically .",
    "in addition , gluonic terms are dropped when determining the quark wave function , @xmath52 , or the scalar field , @xmath53 . making the ansatz ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) that each quark is in an @xmath54-state , we have @xmath55 for the quark wave function , where @xmath56 is a pauli spinor .",
    "this gives the mean field equations of motion    @xmath57    which are solved self - consistently , with @xmath58 for the nucleon .",
    "this yields the solitonic quark wave function and the corresponding scalar field , from which then the quantities of physical interest are calculated while incorporating certain approximate recoil corrections @xcite ; the latter can be compared with methods using projection and boost @xcite . of the five parameters involved ",
    "@xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath23 , @xmath49 and @xmath59  three are fixed by fitting the nucleon mass , the @xmath60 mass and the proton rms charge radius ( 0.83  fm ) .",
    "this leaves two free parameters , for which we choose the dimensionless quantities @xmath61 and @xmath23 .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the self - consistently determined scalar field , @xmath62 , and the corresponding self - interaction potential , @xmath18 , for three different parameter sets .",
    "the solid line corresponds to @xmath63 , for which the bag pressure @xmath21 vanishes and which creates hard bags with a thin surface .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath64 , for which the quadratic term in @xmath18 disappears and @xmath65 turns from a second minimum to an inflection point and which generates soft bags with a thick surface .",
    "the dot - dashed line corresponds to @xmath66 . for all sets ,",
    "@xmath23 is kept at a value of @xmath67 , which yields a reasonable figure for the glueball mass ( 1.5 gev @xmath68 2.0 gev ) . in general , for increasing @xmath69 or @xmath23 , the bag gets softer , the glueball mass and the bag pressure increase , the agreement in the axial vector coupling @xmath70  which is inherently too small by about 10 percent  improves , but the proton s magnetic moment @xmath71  which is also consistently underestimated  grows to differ more from its experimental value .",
    "better agreement with experiment can be achieved by using projection and boost @xcite .",
    "table i gives an overview over the corresponding quantities for the various parameter sets under consideration .    as already remarked , we work in the one gluon exchange approximation . since for both the nucleon and the @xmath60 , all of the quarks are in the same spatial state and the entire system is a color singlet , the total ",
    "mutual plus self  color - electrostatic energy is zero .",
    "the color - magnetic interaction , on the other hand , is responsible for the @xmath0-@xmath60 mass splitting . in general , part of this energy difference",
    "should be attributed to the different pion dressing of the nucleon and the @xmath60 , but since at our present level of approximation the soliton does not contain any pionic effects , we disregard this contribution . as usual @xcite , the magnetic self - energy contribution is neglected here and no intermediate excitations of the quarks into higher spatial orbitals are taken into account .",
    "the evaluation of the @xmath0-@xmath60 mass splitting allows the adjustment of the strong coupling constant , @xmath59 .",
    "hereby , a  confined \" gluonic propagator is used , i.e. the explicit dependence of the gluonic field equations on the dielectric function @xmath11 is taken into account .",
    "for details see sec .",
    "v and ref .",
    "the results are given in table i. for comparison , we also show the values of @xmath59 which we obtain by using a free propagator , i.e. by setting @xmath72 .    another quantity which depends on the gluonic interactions is the string tension @xmath73 .",
    "phenomenologically , it is obtained from fits to heavy quarkonium spectra as the coefficient of the linear term in non - relativistic @xmath74 potentials ( @xmath75 913 mev @xcite ) . in the soliton bag model , it can be calculated by considering a flux tube , which is a cylindrical structure of scalar and gluon fields generated by a quark and an antiquark pair of color charges at infinitely large separation .",
    "in particular , by minimizing the energy of such a system , we obtain the spatial form of the scalar and color - electric fields in the tube , and the string tension .",
    "alternatively , we can adjust the parameters of the model to obtain the  experimental \" string tension .",
    "results for @xmath59 obtained in this way are also given in table i. for further details we refer the reader to ref .",
    "the starting point of any evaluation of the multi - dimensional potential energy surface and the input to any calculation employing the generator coordinate method @xcite is a wave function which is characterized by a set of deformation parameters , which in the following will be denoted collectively as @xmath76 . in our case ,",

    "the reason for this is that configurations of the type @xmath141 , which are missing in a cluster model basis , proved to be quite important . for the relativistic current quark model @xcite , the most relevant states for the isospin - spin channels @xmath142 or @xmath143 turned out to be : latexmath:[\\ ] ]",

    "the relevant expressions can be derived from eqs .",

    "it is important to note that in the oge self - energy terms only the color - electrostatic interaction was taken into account , and that the @xmath197 and @xmath198  off - diagonal \" self - energy terms are essential in providing for the confinement of the color - electric flux @xcite .    the adiabatic potential of eq .",

    "although the exact form of the transformation @xmath200 depends on the details of the hamiltonian and can thus only be established by a consideration of the dynamics involved , which we leave to subsequent work @xcite , the general behavior will still be similar to the one depicted in fig .",
    "approximate recoil corrections @xcite , momentum projection and boost @xcite are not incorporated into the present six - quark calculations . for consistency ,",

    "the scalar field turns abruptly from forming two separated bags to spanning just one united cavity .    an intermediate range attraction , as observed in earlier calculations of that type ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) is not at all visible in our results",
    ". de tar @xcite attributes the latter to the strong color - electrostatic attraction within the quark triplets .",

    "should actually be attributed to the meson exchange , and to get a good description of this in a quark model presumably requires the  sea \" quarks to be taken into account explicitly @xcite , which are not accounted for in our investigation at this stage .",

    "9 we show their relative admixture to the six - quark ground state of the effective hamiltonian as a function of the deformation of the bag . we observe that their contributions become significant as soon as the nucleonic bags overlap considerably , and that up to 50 percent of the ground state wave function can actually be made up of  hidden - color \" states for small inter - nucleon separations , i.e. oblate deformations .",

    "the dashed line corresponds to a calculation where the oge was left out altogether , and in agreement with an earlier investigation @xcite where the friedberg - lee soliton model was applied to @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering we find a strongly attractive adiabatic potential .",
    "the dotted line shows the results of a calculation where only the color - magnetic hyperfine interaction was included , which in the literature is quoted as being responsible for the short - range repulsive core @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that belief , the spin - spin interaction reduces the attraction but does not yield any repulsion . the dot - dashed and the solid line correspond to calculations where , in addition ,",
    "the color - electrostatic oge was included , and they indeed yield a repulsive core .",
    "in contrast to the solid line , which shows the results of a calculation employing a  confined \" scalar green s function , @xmath167 , the dot - dashed line corresponds to the use of a free gluonic propagator , @xmath216 , as outlined in sec . v.",
    "the differences between both calculations prove to be rather minute , which gives us confidence , that the uncertainties we encounter from also evaluating the color - magnetic hyperfine interaction with a free tensor propagator are as well quite small .    in fig .",
    "11 , the adiabatic potential for the isospin - spin channel @xmath209 is split into a gluonic contribution , @xmath217 of eq .",

    "the non - gluonic contribution , which stems from the single particle energies , the scalar @xmath9-field and the external potential used to generate the quark wave functions is always attractive , while the oge part of the hamiltonian is purely repulsive . also , the differences between the two parameter sets , which we observed in the central adiabatic potentials shown in figs .",
    "7 and 8 , almost entirely stem from @xmath190 , with the  hard \" set ( @xmath63 , the solid line ) being much more attractive . as already previously mentioned , the origin of that variations is the very different behavior of the surface energy associated with the scalar @xmath9-field for the two parameter sets under consideration . in spite of that differences ,",
    "their gluonic shares of the energy are very similar .    at this point ,",
    "a more detailed comparison with de tar s @xcite pioneering study of the adiabatic two - nucleon interaction in the framework of the mit bag model is in place . as can be seen from figs .",
    "8 and 9 of ref .",
    "@xcite , for the mit bag model the non - gluonic contribution , @xmath190 , is repulsive , while the gluonic share of the hamiltonian , @xmath217 , yields all the attraction . this is just opposite to our findings .",
    "the difference concerning the non - gluonic interaction is due to the very different nature of the surface dynamics of the scalar background field for the mit and the solitonic bag .",
    "the differences in the gluonic share of the hamiltonian , on the other hand , arise most probably both from the approximations de tar is making in the evaluation of the oge self - energy terms and from the differences in the color - dielectric constant @xmath218 and thus also in the gluonic propagators between the two models .",
    "also , the six - quark configuration space we are using is much larger than the one de tar was employing , and his single - quark states are rather artificial constructions while our  molecular orbitals \" are eigen - states of the constrained mean field hamiltonian .    to get a more detailed understanding of the origins of our results , in table iii we list the various contributions to the adiabatic @xmath0-@xmath0 potential stemming from the individual diagrams shown in fig .",
    "the energies shown are the expectation values of the ground state of the effective hamiltonian for the isospin - spin channel @xmath209 .",

    "the individual oge mutual interaction terms @xmath196 are all attractive , while the self - energy diagrams , @xmath194 and @xmath195 , are entirely repulsive .",
    "furthermore , only if the color - electrostatic  off - diagonal \" self - energy terms @xmath197 and @xmath198 are taken into account , the color - electric flux is confined @xcite , and the interaction vanishes at asymptotic inter - nucleon separations , i.e. @xmath221 for large @xmath8 . that this can really be observed in our results  see the forth and seventh column in the table ",
    "is non - trivial and is a nice confirmation that our numerics are correct .",
    "it can also be seen from table iii , that the adiabatic potential at vanishing @xmath0-@xmath0 separation arises from significant cancellations between individual terms that are rather large , with the repulsive one gluon exchange contributions overpowering the attractive non - gluonic share of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "for all the results reported in this section , the single - quark wave functions were generated from a scalar potential having a particular shape , as characterized by the geometrical parameters @xmath222 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( see eqs .",

    "iii , the radius of the six - quark bag @xmath222 was varied as a function of the deformation such that the volume of the @xmath9-field cavity remains fixed . in order to test the validity of that method , for @xmath105 we constructed self - consistent eigen - states of the total hamiltonian requiring a spherically symmetric scalar field . in table",
    "iv , we compare results for the geometrical shape parameters and the adiabatic potential , which we find from the self - consistent calculation with the corresponding quantities obtained by using the  constant volume \" approach .",
    "results are listed for @xmath142 and @xmath215 .",
    "although the geometrical parameters of the self - consistently determined @xmath9-field are quite different from the ones characterizing @xmath192 in the  constant volume \" approximation , the resulting adiabatic potentials are very similar .",
    "this shows , that the uncertainties we encounter by choosing this particular path in the configuration space spanned by the geometrical parameters @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 will also be minute and should hence not effect our conclusions .",
    "we have evaluated the adiabatic nucleon - nucleon potential in a relativistic quark bag model which yields spatial as well as color confinement and is free of the spurious color van der waals forces troubling most non - relativistic calculations in that realm .",
    "the six - quark system we investigate is confined in a deformed bag - like mean field through an effective non - linear interaction between the quarks and a scalar field .",
    "the shape of this confining field is adjusted to reproduce the corresponding quantity for the asymptotic case of two well separated non - interacting nucleons , and is then varied with deformation treating the scalar field as an incompressible liquid .",
    "six - quark molecular - type configurations are then generated as a function of deformation and their energies are evaluated in a coupled channel analysis . by using molecular states instead of cluster model wave functions",
    ", we can be sure that all important six - quark configurations were properly taken into account , which is a necessary prerequisite for finding reasonable results .",
    "the corresponding effective hamiltonian includes not only the interaction between the quarks and the scalar background field but also quark - quark interactions generated through one gluon exchange evaluated in abelian approximation .",
    "furthermore , when calculating the gluonic propagators mediating that interaction , the inhomogeneity and deformation of the dielectric medium were taken into account and the coulomb gauge was applied .",
    "results for the adiabatic local nucleon - nucleon potential have been presented for the different spin - isospin channels which are compatible with @xmath127 @xmath0-@xmath0 partial waves , and they differ quite considerably from a realistic phenomenological interaction fit to the experimental phase shifts .",
    "although the adiabatic central potentials display a  soft \" repulsive core , as is desirable from phenomenology , they totally lack the intermediate range attraction , which was observed in earlier calculations of that type and which was attributed to the strong color - electrostatic attraction @xcite .",
    "although the color - electrostatic exchange diagrams are entirely attractive also in our investigation , their effects are actually more than cancelled by the repulsive gluonic self - energy diagrams . a detailed analysis of the different contributions to",
    "the effective hamiltonian unveils that the non - gluonic one - body terms would lead to considerable attraction for vanishing inter - nucleon separation , while the one gluon exchange mutual and self - interaction terms produce all the repulsion . to be more specific ,",
    "in our case it is the color - electric one gluon exchange which leads to the repulsion at small @xmath0-@xmath0 separations and not the spin - spin color - magnetic hyperfine interaction , which in the literature is quoted as being responsible for the short - range repulsive core @xcite .    considering that the long and medium range nucleon - nucleon attraction should actually be attributed to explicit meson exchange and not to quark rearrangement",
    ", we are not at all surprised not to get a good description of this part of the interaction in a quark model which does not include the  sea \" quarks",
    ". we plan to overcome that detriment by either including quantum surface fluctuations , which would introduce configurations of the form @xmath5 in addition to our @xmath6 basis states , or by considering an explicit pion exchange between the individual quarks along the lines followed in the cloudy bag model @xcite .",
    "the latter mechanism is favorable as it also leads to a restoration of the broken chiral symmetry .",
    "work in that direction is currently in progress @xcite .",
    "finally , we also plan to account for the dynamics of the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction by extending this work through means of the generator coordinate method @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a significant part of the short - range @xmath0-@xmath0 repulsion is due to dynamics @xcite , and that the absence of a repulsive core in some early calculations was an artifact of the adiabatic approximation @xcite .",
    "in addition , the effective @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction is highly non - local in terms of the separation parameter .",
