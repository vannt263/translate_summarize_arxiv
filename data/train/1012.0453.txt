    "a very interesting aspect of lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations is that one can study the quark mass dependence of physical observables which are otherwise hard to measure with experiments .",
    "this information could be used to constrain the time variation @xcite of quark masses in the evolution of the universe beane:2002vs , beane:2002xf , epelbaum:2002gb , flambaum:2007mj .",

    "much has been learned from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quark mass ( we will work in the isosymmetric limit @xmath3 ) dependence of the meson and single baryon observables @xcite  through lattice qcd ( lqcd ) @xcite , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) gasser:1983yg , gasser:1984gg , jenkins:1990jv , bernard:1995dp and experimental data . in principle ,",
    "lattice qcd can map out all the @xmath2 dependence for these observables .",
    "however , most of the calculations are done with @xmath2 s larger than their physical values , because it requires more computing resources to work with smaller @xmath2 .",
    "fortunately , chpt , which is an effective field theory ( eft ) of qcd , can be used to described the @xmath2 dependence once the unknown parameters in the theory are fixed by either experiments or lattice data .    in the multi - baryon sector",
    ", much progress has been made in lqcd in two nucleon fukugita:1994ve , beane:2006mx , ishii:2006ec , aoki:2008hh , beane:2009py , nucleon - hyperon @xcite , triton beane:2009gs , yamazaki:2009ua and @xmath4-particle @xcite systems ( see @xcite for a brief review ) .",

    "( note that the physical pion mass @xmath6 mev , and there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath5 and @xmath2 , e.g. @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "so the @xmath5 and @xmath2 dependence can be converted to each other . )",
    "even so , as will be demonstrated in this work , this information is enough to determine the leading @xmath5 dependence  of all the low energy matrix elements involving deuterons .",
    "we will focus on processes with the typical momentum @xmath9 , such that the pions can be taken as heavy particles and integrated out of the theory .",
    "this theory is known as pionless theory kaplan:1996nv , bedaque:1997qi , chen:1999tn , beane:2000fi .",
    "the information of the pion dynamics in the pionful theory is now encoded in the @xmath5 dependent couplings of the pionless theory .",
    "it is found that , all the leading @xmath5 dependence in deuteron matrix elements in the pionless theory can be computed using the pionful theory together with the @xmath5 dependence  of the s - wave scattering lengths obtained from lqcd .",
    "thus , once they are fixed at @xmath10 , their values at other pion masses are also known .    of course , one can still work with the pionful theory .",
    "the matching is a convenient but not necessary step to take .",
    "one advantage of working with the theory without pions is that once the @xmath5 dependence of the couplings are worked out , one can just perform the calculation in the pionless theory instead of the more complicated pionful theory . as an explicit example",
    ", we match the pionful theory based on beane , kaplan and vuorinen s ( bkv ) beane:2008bt power counting scheme to a pionless theory .",
    "this allows the matching been done analytically .",
    "however , the method can be applied to other power schemes as well .",
    "currently , there are several power counting schemes for the nuclear effective theory used for multinucleon systems",
    ". power counting means counting the power of the small expansion parameter of a feynman diagram , such that one can organize the computation in a series expansion of this parameter . in nuclear eft , the small expansion parameter @xmath11 is @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the cut - off scale .",
    "here we briefly review some popular power counting schemes .    in weinberg s scheme @xcite , power counting",
    "is done to the potential of the lippmann - schwinger equation , not the diagram . the leading - order ( lo )",
    "potential involves the one pion exchange ( ope ) potential and the delta function potential from contact interactions . subtracting the infinities in the lo  diagram",
    "requires higher order operators with high power of quark mass insertions .",
    "thus , the result has cut - off dependence that can not be removed kaplan:1996xu , beane:2001bc , nogga:2005hy .",
    "a similar situation happens to higher partial waves as well @xcite .",
    "however , within a reasonable range of cut - off , the scheme works well numerically with impressive fits to nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering phase shift data at the fourth order ordonez:1992xp , ordonez:1993tn , vankolck:1994yi , ordonez:1995rz , friar:1998zt , rentmeester:1999vw , bernard:1996gq , epelbaum:1999dj , epelbaum:2000mx , epelbaum:2002ji , epelbaum:2003xx , epelbaum:2004fk , entem:2001cg , entem:2002sf , entem:2003 ft , pavonvalderrama:2005wv , pavonvalderrama:2005uj .",
    "the alternative ksw scheme @xcite counts the diagrams near the non - trivial uv fixed point of the four - nucleon operators such that the cut - off dependence is removed and diagrams of the same order are of equal size .",
    "the lo s - wave diagrams only contain non - derivative four - nucleon contact interactions , while the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) contains ope diagrams and diagrams with higher order four - nucleon operators .",
    "however , numerically , the convergence is not good in the @xmath15 channel due to the singular  nature of the tensor pion exchange potential at short distance @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the distance between two nucleons fleming:1999bs , fleming:1999ee .",
    "the suggests that the tensor pion exchange might not be perturbative .    in view of this problem",
    ", the tensor pion exchange is resummed at the lo in the bbsvk scheme @xcite where the @xmath18 channel follows the ksw power counting while the @xmath15 channel follows the weinberg s power counting .",
    "it was shown that the cut - off can be removed in this scheme .",
    "the bkv scheme @xcite seeks to fix the same problem by introducing a pauli - villars ( pv ) field in the @xmath15 channel to remove the short distance part of the singular tensor potential .",
    "the resulting @xmath15 phase shift is convergent .",
    "the price to pay is that the pv mass @xmath19 is counted as the same order as @xmath5 , but numerically it is close to the cut - off scale .",
