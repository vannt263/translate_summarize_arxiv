    "accretion powered high mass x - ray binary pulsar oao  1657 - 415 was discovered by copernicus satellite ( polidan et al .",
    "initially , the object was incorrectly identified with the massive binary v861  sco and the system interpreted as a black hole binary .",
    "however , the observations with heao  1 and einstein observatories were used to determine the precise position of the source that ruled out v861  sco as the companion of oao  1657 - 415 . using the same data , a pulsation period of 38.22 s was detected in the pulsar ( white & pravo 1979 ; parmar et al .",
    "long - term monitoring of the pulsar with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) onboard compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) confirmed the system as an eclipsing binary ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "the orbital parameters derived from the batse observations are : orbital period p@xmath1 = 10.444@xmath20.004 d , duration of the eclipse = 1.7d , @xmath3 = 0.104@xmath20.005 , @xmath4sin  @xmath5 = 106@xmath20.5 lt - sec and @xmath6 = 93@xmath7 .",

    ". however , the counterpart was not detected at the @xmath9 position of the pulsar in the deep optical imaging of the field with a limitings magnitude of v@xmath1023 , near infrared ( nir ) imaging revealed a highly reddened b - type supergiant star as binary companion of oao  1657 - 415 ( chakrabarty et al .",

    "the supergiant x - ray binaries ( sgxbs ; a subclass of hmxbs ) are classified into disk - fed and wind - fed sgxb .",

    "therefore , the investigation of iron emission lines provides powerful tool to understand the characteristics of the accretion plasma and their spatial distribution in extreme physical conditions around the neutron star .",
    "strength of iron emission lines depend on the continuum emission and the density / amount of available line emitting materials .",
    "the change in observed values of iron emission line parameters with a short duration over orbital phase implies the presence of inhomogeneously distributed matter over the orbit of the binary pulsar .",
    "_ suzaku _ observation of oao  1657 - 415 during out - of - eclipse orbital phase in 2011 september showed the presence of 6.4 kev and 7.06 kev iron emission lines in its spectrum . although the observed continuum flux of the pulsar was highly variable during the observation , both the lines were present in the spectrum during entire observation .",
    "however , strength of these lines were significantly different even during the extended durations of low intensity levels . during region - ii",

    "the value of equivalent hydrogen column density was also found to be high during region - ii compared to that during region - i ( table  1 ) .",
    "flux of both the lines was found to be directly correlated with the observed continuum flux ( figure  [ fe - line ] ) .",
    "this indicates the fluorescence origin of iron lines from the cool matter surrounding the neutron star ( makishima 1986 ) .",
    "the direct correlation between the line flux and pulsar continuum flux also suggests that the location of reprocessing region is closer to the central source .",
    "observed changes in the iron emission line parameters with respect to continuum flux led to the interpretation of line emitting regions in the accretion powered x - ray pulsars .",
    "investigation of iron emission lines in the hmxb pulsar cen  x-3 during eclipse - ingress , eclipse , eclipse - egress and out - of - eclipse phases confirmed that the fe k@xmath38 line is being originated from regions close to neutron star whereas 6.7 kev and 6.97 kev lines are produced in a region that is far from the neutron star , probably in the highly photo - ionized wind of the companion star or in the accretion disk corona ( ebisawa et al .",

    "considering the similarities in the changes in the iron line parameters with source flux in cen  x-3 , lmc  x-4 , her  x-1 , we suggest that the flux variation at different orbital phases of oao  1657 - 415 , as seen in the 2011 @xmath18 observation of the pulsar , can be explained by the presence of additional dense absorbing matter at corresponding orbital phases .",
    "further observations of oao  1657 - 415 would confirm whether the segment of low flux level ( due to obscuration / absorption of direct x - rays from the pulsar ) repeatedly present ( possibly because of the presence of structures in the close proximity of the pulsar ) or a temporary one due to the presence of clump of matter .",
    "the pulsar oao  1657 - 415 showed significant flux variability during the @xmath18 observation in 2011 september .",
    "though the observation was carried out during out - of - eclipse phase of 10.44 d orbital period , there were two elongated segments of low flux levels followed by regions of high flux level .",

    "significant flux variability in oao  1657 - 415 during @xmath18 observation can be explained by using clumpy stellar wind model ( feldmeier et al .",

    "considering inhomogeneous distribution of matter in the stellar wind , the luminosity of such wind - powered hmxb pulsars depends on the density and velocity of the stellar wind through the relation ( bondi & hoyle 1944 ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 is density and @xmath56 is the wind velocity as described in @xmath57-velocity law ( castor et al . 1975 ) .",
    "any fluctuation in either density or velocity profile produces the time variability in the source luminosity .",
    "the clumpy wind model can explain the observed variability in circumstellar absorption and source flux .",
    "the physical parameters of the clumpy wind can be estimated from the observed time variability in the light curve of oao  1657 - 415 using this model .",
    "figure-@xmath58 shows the presence of a series of flares of duration of @xmath5910  ks . considering a flare of duration t@xmath60  ks and relative wind velocity v@xmath61  km  s@xmath43 ( taking an approximation of terminal velocity similar to the relative velocity ; mason et al .",
    "2012 ) , the radius of the clump can be @xmath62 gravitational influence of the neutron star on the clumps becomes effective at the accretion radius r@xmath632gm@xmath64/v@xmath65 .",
    "as a clump of matter crosses this radius , it gets accreted toward the neutron star . the accretion radius for oao  1657 - 415 is calculated to be @xmath06@xmath2010@xmath66  cm by assuming typical parameters of the neutron star and relative stellar wind velocity of 250  km  s@xmath43 . accretion radius also imposes a constrain on upper limit of the radius of a clump that can be accreted entirely onto the neutron star .",
    "mass of the accreted clump can be estimated by comparing the gravitational potential energy of clump to the energy released due to its accretion onto the neutron star ( assuming efficiency @xmath67 as 0.1 ) through the relation ( zeldovich & shakura 1969 ) @xmath68 where m@xmath64 , r@xmath64 and l@xmath69 are mass , radius and x - ray luminosity of the neutron star , respectively .",
    "therefore , for a given set of physical parameters of the spherical clump , its mean density ( n@xmath70 ) and radial column density ( n@xmath70 ) can be estimated as @xmath71 @xmath72 using the typical parameters in equation ( @xmath73 ) , the mean density of a clump can be estimated to be 4@xmath2010@xmath66  @xmath74 . however , the mean number density of the stellar wind around the neutron star is calculated to be n@xmath04@xmath2010@xmath75  @xmath74 by using the @xmath57-velocity law ( castor et al . 1975 ) and the wind parameters from mason et al .",

    "this supports the suggestion that the observed flux variability in the pulsar light curve can be explained by using clumpy wind hypothesis .",
    "however , in case of the flare during segments g & h , the estimated clump column density from spectral fitting is quite high compared to the expected column density calculated by using equation  [ rcd ] in case of a spherically symmetric clump of homogeneous density .",
    "the enhancement in the value of column density compared to the standard wind density can occur because of the instability in variable and highly structured stellar wind . as the supersonic stellar wind interacts with the neutron star , a bow shock of compressed gas forms near r@xmath78 that may cause enhancement in the column density .",
    "numerical simulation results for the wind - fed sources indicate that the regions inside the non - steady accretion wake consist of dense filaments in which the density reaches up to @xmath0100 times more as compared to undisturbed stellar wind ( blondin et al .",
    "such dense clump or filament can absorb the x - ray photons up to higher energies and results the low flux levels in the light curve .",
    "interaction of x - ray photons either in dense filaments or stagnated shock front can contribute to higher value of the equivalent width .",

    "different model components were considered in the above study .",
    "a model with a combination of direct and scattered continuum component explained the possibility of high equivalent width ( up to order of kev ) with variation in n@xmath53 .",
    "if the absorbing matter situated directly between the observer and the x - ray source , then the equivalent width for emission lines was found to be monotonically proportional to the column density . as a result the high equivalent width ( more than 100 ev ) for 6.4 kev line was seen at n@xmath53 @xmath79 10@xmath14  @xmath15 .    in summary",
    ", we interpret our results based on the clumpy wind hypothesis .",
    "the extended low flux levels of region - i & ii can be interpreted as the presence of dense clump or filament of the compressed gas .",
    "the high equivalent width of fe k@xmath38 and fe k@xmath41 lines can be understood by the result obtain from monte carlo simulation ( inoue 1985 ) in which the dense clump of matter obscures the direct x - rays and contributes to the high value of equivalent width as observed in region - ii . during the orbital phase 0.19 - 0.24 ( region - ii ) ,",
    "the clump could be situated along the line - of - sight .",
    "as the clump passes region - ii the absorption column density decreases and causes decrease in the equivalent width of iron emission lines .",
    "lifetime of this clump can be similar to duration of region - ii .",
    "furthermore , decrease in the absorption column density and increase in the source flux in region - iii & region - iv suggest the obstruction or either the accretion of matter by relatively low dense or off line clumps .      to investigate the ionization state of matter ( iron ) in line emitting region , the ratio of fe k@xmath41 line flux to that of fe k@xmath38 line was calculated for the entire @xmath18 observation of oao  1657 - 415 .",
    "it was found that the value of flux ratio varies between 0.15@xmath20.11 and 0.42@xmath20.18 for all segments .",
    "the value of line flux ratio for each segment was found to be higher than the theoretically predicted value ( @xmath00.13 ) for neutral iron atom in optical thin medium ( kaastra & mewe 1993 ; palmeri et al .",
    "2003 ; han & demir 2009 ) .",
    "this suggests that the line emitting region can be a mixture of neutral and ionized iron atoms .",

    "flux of the iron emission lines was found to be variable with the continuum flux whereas the equivalent width was nearly constant with flux except for region - ii .",
    "the correlation between observed line flux and continuum flux suggests the fluorescent origin of the iron lines from the regions near to the neutron star .",

    "considering the high value of absorption density during the segments of low flux level and high values of iron line equivalent widths , we can explain that the low flux segments in oao  1657 - 415 are due to the presence of dense clumpy matter at certain orbital phases of the binary system .",
