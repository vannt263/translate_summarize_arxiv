    "euclidean correlation functions are dominated by contributions from the corresponding lowest - energy states at sufficiently large time separation @xmath1 .",
    "this property , called the ground state saturation , is heavily used in lattice qcd to extract various hadronic observables such as masses , decay constants and other matrix elements .",
    "the ground state saturation , however , is difficult to be achieved for multi - baryon systems .",
    "for example , the signal - to - noise ratio for the correlation of @xmath2-nucleons reads  @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the nucleon mass and the pion mass , respectively .",
    "this relative enhancement of statistical noise at large @xmath1 for @xmath6 is a common problem for baryonic systems , even for a single baryon @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , there exists another problem for the multi - hadrons at large @xmath1 caused by the small splitting between the ground and the 1st excited states for large volume .",
    "for example , in the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath8 ) system , the minimum splitting is estimated as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a spatial extension of the lattice . if @xmath11 fm and @xmath12 gev , we have @xmath13 mev @xmath14 .",
    "the ground state saturation requires @xmath15 fm , which corresponds to @xmath16 for the lattice spacing @xmath17 fm .",
    "it is very difficult to extract signals at such large @xmath1 due to the bad behavior of statistical noise in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - n ] ) . to avoid these problems , techniques such as the use of improved operators and/or the diagonalization of matrix correlation functions",
    "@xcite have been employed .    recently , a novel method to derive hadron - hadron interactions from lattice qcd was developed by hal qcd collaboration @xcite-@xcite , where the nambu - bethe - salpeter ( nbs ) wave function is utilized to extract the hadron - hadron potentials . since its extraction from hadronic correlation functions relies on the ground state saturation , the problems mentioned above may exist in principle . in this paper",
    ", we introduce time dependent schrdinger - like equation which can utilize the information of moderate @xmath1 and can avoid the problem of ground state saturation .",
    "this allows one to derive the hadron - hadron potentials as defined in the original hal qcd method with less systematic errors .",
    "the key observation is that the scattering states with  different \" energies on the lattice are governed by the  same \" non - local potential @xmath18 . the present time - dependent method has already been applied successfully to the baryon - baryon ( @xmath19 ) potentials in the flavor - su(3 ) limit @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we give a full theoretical account of this imaginary - time hal qcd method by taking the @xmath8 scattering with ( 2 + 1)-flavor lattice qcd as a concrete example .",
    "in the original hal qcd method , the  time - independent \" nbs wave function was shown to satisfy the following  time - independent \" schrdinger equation @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 with @xmath4 being the nucleon mass .",
    "the potential @xmath22 is non - local but independent on @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the equal - time nbs wave function is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the vacuum and a two - nucleon state with an asymptotic momentum @xmath27 , respectively , and @xmath28 denotes a composite interpolating field for the nucleon .",
    "for @xmath28 being local , the reduction formula for local composite operators @xcite can be used to establish the relation between the nbs wave function and the s - matrix : the asymptotic behavior of the nbs wave function at long distance reads @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the ( scattering ) phase of the s - matrix .",
    "therefore the @xmath8 potential in eq.([eq.schrodinger ] ) gives correct phase shift @xmath30 for all @xmath23 in the elastic region @xmath31 , by construction .    in lattice qcd calculations , nbs wave functions are extracted from the @xmath8 correlation function using the ground state saturation as @xmath32    |0\\rangle    \\label{eq.four - point.correlator }    \\nonumber \\\\    & = &    \\sum_{n }    \\psi_n(\\vec x - \\vec y )    \\cdot    a_n e^{-e_n t } \\nonumber \\\\    &   \\rightarrow &    \\psi_0(\\vec x - \\vec",
    "y ) a_0 e^{-e_0 t } \\quad ( t\\rightarrow\\infty ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is a two - nucleon source located at @xmath34 , @xmath35 denotes the spatial volume , @xmath36 denotes an nbs wave function for an intermediate state @xmath37 with the energy @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . in the spin - singlet sector , for example , the central potential @xmath40 in the leading order of the velocity expansion , @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the `` asymptotic momentum '' for the ground - state .",
    "the ground state saturation is crucial here to extract the potential .",
    "in this section , we propose an alternative derivation of potential without using the ground state saturation .",
    "for this purpose , we consider the normalized @xmath8 correlation function @xmath44 we here assume that @xmath1 is moderately large such that elastic contributions ( at @xmath45 ) dominate @xmath46 .    as before , we write @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 . from an identity @xmath50 it is easy to see @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the integration kernel associated with the non - local potential @xmath22 .",
    "thanks to eq.([eq.schrodinger ] ) , @xmath53 in the first line can be replaced by @xmath54 in the second line .",
    "we then arrive at the `` time - dependent '' schrdinger - like equation , @xmath55 which shows that the same potential @xmath22 as defined in eq.([eq.schrodinger ] ) can be obtained from @xmath56 .",
    "an advantage of this method is that the ground state saturation ( or more generally a single state saturation ) is not required for @xmath56 to satisfy eq.([eq.tdep ] ) .",
    "several comments are in order here : + ( i ) for the present method to work , @xmath1 has to be large enough such that elastic contributions at @xmath57 dominate @xmath56 . note that such @xmath1 is much smaller than that required for the ground state saturation .",
    "this is especially so for the large volume , since typical size of gaps between energy eigenvalues shrinks as @xmath58 . while it becomes more and more difficult to achieve the ground state saturation for larger volume , the requirement of the elastic dominance @xmath59 is less sensitive to the volume size .",
    "+ ( ii ) in the leading order of the velocity expansion , eq.([eq.tdep ] ) leads to a generalization of eq.([eq.prev.pot ] ) @xmath60 for the spin - singlet sector .",
    "we can also include the higher order terms of the velocity expansion as discussed in ref .",
    "convergence of the velocity expansion in the original hal qcd method can be examined by comparing local potentials at two different energies as discussed in ref .",
    "equivalently , in the present method , the convergence can be examined by comparing the local potentials obtained for different @xmath1 s .",
    "+ ( iii ) @xmath61 in eq.([eq.tdep ] ) plays a role of @xmath62 in eq.([eq.schrodinger ] ) . for @xmath63 where the ground state saturation is achieved , eq.([eq.tdep ] )",
    "reduces to eq.([eq.schrodinger ] ) .",
    "we therefore can regard the `` time - dependent '' schrdinger - like equation as an extension of the time - independent schrdinger equation ( eq.([eq.schrodinger ] ) ) .",
    "+ ( iv ) in the non - relativistic limit where @xmath64 , `` time - dependent '' schrdinger - like equation leads to @xmath65 therefore , the 2nd derivative term of @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.tdep ] ) corresponds to the relativistic effect .",
    "to test the present method , we employ ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd gauge configurations generated by pacs - cs collaboration @xcite on @xmath66 lattice with the rg improved iwasaki gauge action at @xmath67 and the non - perturbatively @xmath68 improved wilson quark action at @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this parameter set corresponds to the lattice spacing @xmath71 fm ( @xmath72 gev ) , the spatial extent @xmath73 fm , @xmath74 mev and @xmath75 mev .",
    "the periodic boundary condition is used for spatial directions , while the dirichlet boundary condition is taken for the temporal direction at @xmath76 and @xmath77 , to avoid opposite propagations of two nucleons in temporal direction , i.e , one propagates forward and the other propagates backward . from time - reversal and charge conjugation symmetries , we can average over forward propagation at @xmath78 and backward propagation at @xmath79 with a source at @xmath34 . by temporally shifting gauge configurations ,",
    "21 source points are used per one configuration and 390 gauge configurations are employed in total .",
    "statistical errors are estimated by the jackknife method with a bin size of 10 configurations .",
    "composite operators for the proton and the neutron are taken to be @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively . in our actual calculation",
    ", we replace @xmath82 in eq.([eq.r - correlator ] ) by the single - nucleon correlator @xmath83|0\\rangle$ ] to suppress statistical noises of @xmath84 .",
    "this replacement is permitted as long as the ground state saturation for @xmath85 is achieved .",
    "time derivatives in eq.([eq.new - formula ] ) are evaluated after applying the polynomial interpolation of degree 5 to @xmath56 .    in order to see how excited states of the two nucleons affect the final @xmath8 potential",
    ", we introduce a source function with a real parameter @xmath86 as @xmath87 which reduces to the wall source at @xmath88 .",
    "two - nucleon source is then defined by @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 with @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "figure  [ fig.1 ] ( left ) shows @xmath94 at @xmath95 for @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "if the ground state saturation were achieved , results with different values of @xmath86 should be the same up to overall normalizations .",
    "figure  [ fig.1 ] ( left ) reveals that contamination from the excited states is non - negligible at @xmath95 . as shown in figure  [ fig.1](right ) , the contamination is transferred to the @xmath86 dependence of @xmath99/c_{nn}(\\vec r , t)$ ] .",
    "figure  [ fig.new-method](left ) shows @xmath100 obtained from our present method eq.([eq.new - formula ] ) for three values of @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath86 dependence seen in figure  [ fig.1](right ) disappears within statistical errors .",
    "three contributions to @xmath100 in eq.([eq.new - formula ] ) are separately shown in figure  [ fig.new-method](right ) for @xmath88 .",
    "we observe that the first term of eq.([eq.new - formula ] ) ( the red points ) determines the main trend , while the second term ( the blue points ) gives an important correction .",
    "the third term ( the green points ) , on the other hand , is negligible , showing that the non - relativistic approximation @xmath101 works well in this case .",
    "note that the @xmath102-dependence of the second term in eq.([eq.new - formula ] ) , @xmath103 , is a useful measure of the departure from the ground state saturation .",
    "we now calculate the @xmath8 scattering phase shift , by solving the schrdinger equation with the potential @xmath100 in the infinite volume . for this purpose ,",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig.scattering.phase](left ) , the central potential @xmath104 is fitted with multi - gaussian functions as @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are used as fit parameters , @xmath108 denotes the number of gaussian functions .",
    "we then solve the schrdinger equation in @xmath0 channel @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig.scattering.phase](right ) shows the scattering phase @xmath30 extracted from the long distance behavior of the solution @xmath109 , together with the experimental data for comparison .",
    "qualitative feature of the phase shift as a function of @xmath23 is well reproduced , though the strength is weaker , most likely due to the heavy pion mass ( @xmath110 mev ) in this calculation .",
    "in fact , the recent 3-flavor qcd simulations show that the @xmath8 phase shift approaches toward the physical value as the quark mass decreases @xcite .",
    "the scattering length for @xmath110 mev in the present method , calculated from the derivative of the scattering phase shift at @xmath111 , leads to @xmath112 fm .",
    "by extending the present method further , one may directly extract the non - local potential .",
    "let us introduce a more general @xmath8 correlation function , @xmath113      \\vert 0 \\rangle}{(e^{-m_n t})^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is shown to satisfy @xmath114 here the matrix indices @xmath115 for @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath52 and a necessary integration over spatial coordinates are implicit .",
    "the non - local potential is then extracted as @xmath118 where an approximated inverse of the hermitian operator @xmath117 is defined by @xmath119 here @xmath120 and @xmath121 are an eigenvalue of @xmath117 and its eigenvector , respectively .",
    "zero eigenvalues are removed in the summation . note that @xmath52 which satisfies eq.([eq : general ] ) is not unique , since @xmath122 also satisfies the same equation for arbitrary @xmath123 .",
    "this is related to the fact that the zero - modes or nearly zero - modes are associated with states above the inelastic threshold .",
    "a method to extract hadron - hadron interactions by generalizing the original hal qcd method is proposed .",
    "we derived `` time - dependent '' schrdinger - like equation , a second order differential equation in @xmath1 , which enables us to construct @xmath8 potentials without assuming the ground state saturation in the elastic region @xmath124 .",
    "we have shown that this method works well for extracting the central @xmath8 potential in the @xmath0 channel : identical potential is obtained for different source - operators within the statistical error . also , resultant @xmath8 potential , the scattering phase shift and the scattering length are much improved both qualitatively and quantitatively from those obtained by assuming ground state saturation .    while we have considered the system only in the elastic region so far , an extension to the inelastic region",
    "is also possible . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that one can define and extract the hadronic potentials above inelastic threshold . together with the framework proposed in this paper",
    ", this could provide a novel prescription to solve the s - matrix in qcd .",
