    "the identification of the nature of the dark matter ( dm ) of the universe is a major open problem in modern physics @xcite . among the diverse strategies for dm searches ,",
    "the study of the possible impact of dm in the properties of stars has been explored in recent years as a complementary approach to the dm problem  @xcite . in particular , weakly interacting dm candidates with an intrinsic matter - antimatter asymmetry  @xcite do not annihilate after gravitational capture by compact astrophysical objects and can therefore strongly influence their internal structure @xcite .",
    "thus , both the observation or the lack of observation of the impact of asymmetric dm ( adm ) on the properties of stars can be used to put constraints on the characteristics of these dm candidates .",
    "the interior of the sun , being known with a high accuracy thanks to solar neutrinos and helioseismic data , is an excellent laboratory to probe the existence and the properties of adm particles .",
    "such particles remove energy from the inner @xmath24% of the sun , leading to a reduction of the central temperature and the creation of an isothermal core  @xcite . in particular , adm candidates with low - masses and large spin - dependent ( sd ) proton scattering cross sections may influence the internal solar structure so strongly that they would produce clear signatures in the low - degree frequency spacings and in the solar gravity modes  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , low - mass weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) with similar characteristics provide an explanation for the signals in various direct detection experiments , strengthening the motivation for the search of indirect signatures of these particles .",
    "it has also been shown that these low - mass adm candidates may produce marked effects in very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs  @xcite . in environments with high adm densities ,",
    "solar - like stars may show significant deviations in their evolutionary tracks  @xcite .",
    "also neutron stars , due to their compactness , capture dm very efficiently and may be strongly influenced by the accumulation of adm  @xcite . here",
    "we will show that , even for a dm density as low as the expected in the solar neighborhood , @xmath3gev @xmath4  @xcite , main - sequence stars with masses similar to that of the sun present distinct signatures of the captured adm .    with the advent of asteroseismology , a precious insight into the stellar interiors",

    "the seismic analysis of stars other than the sun is complementary to helioseismic dm searches because it allows the study of stars with lower masses , which are more strongly influenced by dm , and stars whose dominant energy transport mechanisms may change due to the dm influence . in this letter",
    "we will demonstrate , by studying the case of the stars kic 8006161 , hd 52265 and @xmath1 cen b , that present asteroseismic observations do constrain a significant region of the dm parameter space .",

    "if these dm particles have a non - negligible scattering cross section off baryons ( so they are wimps ) , then some of them may collide with the nucleons of the stellar plasma , losing kinetic energy .",
    "a fraction of these dm particles is gravitationally captured by the stars . to calculate the capture rate we follow the formalism that was early developed by @xcite , as implemented in @xcite .",
    "we assume a maxwell - boltzmann distribution of the velocities of the dm particles , with a dispersion @xmath22 km s@xmath23 , and a stellar velocity of @xmath24 km s@xmath23 .",
    "the expected deviation from the mentioned fiducial values for the specific stars studied in this work may lead to a maximum error on the capture rate of approximately 15% ( see @xcite for details ) .    in the asymmetric wimp scenario , the annihilation cross sections required to match the dm relic density are larger than in the standard wimp scenario , depending on the degree of asymmetry @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the asymmetric scenario the particles concentrated on the stellar core can not find a partner with whom to annihilate ( the dm particle is not its own anti - particle ) and therefore their number grows indefinitely while more particles are being captured . the same efficiency in the stellar accumulation of dm occurs for very feebly annihilating ( @xmath25@xmath26s@xmath23 ) majorana dm particles .",
    "in other cases , the captured dm would have no relevant impact on nearby low - mass stars .",
    "the evaporation of dm particles can be neglected for the adm candidates and stars considered in this work : while a low stellar mass tends to favor evaporation , this fact is compensated by the cooler stellar temperatures , @xmath27  @xcite , in agreement with the results of @xcite for @xmath28 stars .",
    "the dm particles captured in the stellar core provide a new energy transport mechanism that removes energy from the center of the star .",
    "the efficiency of this mechanism depends mainly on the ratio between the mean free path of the wimps inside the stellar plasma @xmath29 and the characteristic radius of the wimps distribution in the core of the star @xmath30  @xcite . for most of the wimp - proton sd scattering cross sections @xmath31 considered here , @xmath32 and the energy transport by wimps is non - local . on the other hand , for large values of @xmath31 , @xmath33 so the wimps are in local thermal equilibrium with the baryons .",
    "the latter regime applies only to values of @xmath31 which are not considered in this work ( @xmath34@xmath35 ) .",
    "however , we follow the prescription described in @xcite that extends the formalism developed for the local thermal equilibrium to other regimes by the use of tabulated suppression factors .",
    "the dm capture and energy transport mechanisms were implemented in ` cesam `  , a sophisticated stellar evolution code . in the case of the sun , the results of our modified solar model ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) are in agreement with those of other codes in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the observational constraints used for the modeling of the stars kic 8006161 , hd 52265 , and @xmath1 cen b , as well as the results of some selected models with and without taking into account the dm effects , are summarized in table  [ tab - starchars ] .",
    "the main signature of the additional dm cooling mechanism is a decrease in the central temperature and an increase in the central density .",
    "these variations are shown in figure  [ fig - tc ] for several dm - modified stellar models , calibrated to reproduce the observed properties of the star kic 8006161 , for a range of dm masses and sd scattering cross sections .",
    "compared with the standard modeling , for @xmath36gev and @xmath37@xmath35 we found a @xmath38 decline in the central temperature .",
    "the variations on the internal properties are larger than those reported in the case of the sun  @xcite because the importance of the energy transported by the wimps ( @xmath39 ) over the thermonuclear energy ( @xmath40 ) increases when the stellar mass decreases .",
    "in particular , in our computations we found the dm cooling to reduce the @xmath41 of 0.7 m@xmath0 stars nine times more efficiently than for 1.1 m@xmath0 stars .",
    "this fact reinforces the potential advantages of performing dm searches in stars other than the sun .    ]      in the standard picture of stellar evolution , stars with masses greater than 1.1 m@xmath0 are expected to keep a convective core during most of the main sequence , while stars with lower masses quickly lose their convective cores .",
    "convection arises when the gradient of temperature in the core is so steep that a rising bubble of plasma does not cool enough with its adiabatic expansion , so that it continues to rise , leading to a convective instability .",
    "if the temperature gradient is reduced by an additional mechanism such as the energy transport by wimps , then the conditions for convection may no longer be achieved .",
    "this possibility was first suggested in , where the suppression of convection in horizontal branch stars was predicted using analytical approximations .",
    "this scenario must not be confused with the creation of an unexpected convective core in 1 m@xmath0 stars due to the self - annihilation of dm particles captured in halos with very high dm densities  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the temperature gradient in the stellar interior due to the additional cooling by wimps was found to suppress the convective core expected in stars with masses slightly greater than that of the sun .",
    "the standard modeling of the star hd 52265 predicted a convective core during all the main sequence , but this convective core rapidly disappeared when the energy transport by wimps was taken into account ( see figure  [ fig - cc](a ) ) . the range of dm masses and sd scattering cross sections for which the suppression of the hd 52265 convective core is expected is shown in figure  [ fig - cc](b ) ) .",
    "interestingly , hints of the signatures of a convective core in hd 52265 were reported in @xcite . however , no conclusive information can be extracted until there is no definitive diagnostic of its presence or its absence ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "( b ) the presence of a convective core in hd 52265 depends on the mass and sd scattering cross section of the dm particles.[fig - cc],title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the characteristic signatures reported in the last section are potentially detectable with the analysis of the stellar oscillations .",
    "asteroseismology is presently showing its power in determining with high precision not only the global properties of stars but also their internal structure .",
    "in particular , the small frequency separations of low angular degree ( @xmath43 ) and radial order @xmath44 , @xmath45 , have been shown to provide useful information about the core of the stars  @xcite .",
    "thus , we would expect the seismic parameter @xmath46 to be sensitive to the modifications introduced by the wimps on stars .",
    "we have computed the oscillation frequencies and separations of the dm - modified stellar models of kic 8006161 , hd 52265 and @xmath1 cen b using the ` adipls ` package  . in order to disentangle the effects of dm from those arising from the variation of the stellar parameters ,",
    "a very precise determination of the latter is of utmost importance .",
    "although asteroseismology has already provided very accurate measurements of the mass and radius of kic 8006161  @xcite and hd 52265  @xcite , with uncertainties of the order of 1% , we preferred to focus here on the case of @xmath1 cen b , a star whose fundamental parameters are independently measured with high precision ( see table  [ tab - starchars ] ) thanks to its proximity and because it belongs to a binary system .",
    "the mass of this star has been determined from the radial velocities of @xmath1 cen a and b , its effective temperature from high quality spectra , its luminosity from photometric data and its radius from measurements of its angular diameter combined with parallax ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    all stellar models used to create figure  [ fig - ssacb ] reproduce the measured @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and mean large frequency separation @xmath52 of @xmath1 cen b within the observational error . however",
    ", while models without dm are also able to reproduce the observed mean small frequency separation @xmath46 , we found that the stellar models with a strong influence of dm predict a @xmath46 significantly deviated from the observed value .",
    "the black lines in figure  [ fig - ssacb ] , labeled @xmath53 and @xmath54 , show the dm characteristics corresponding to the calibrated models that predicted a @xmath46 with a difference of two and five times the observational error , respectively , from the observed value .",
    "the dashed black lines around the @xmath53 line show the uncertainty in the modeling when the observational errors in the stellar characteristics @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are taken into account .",
    "this uncertainty corresponds to the standard deviation on @xmath46 , evaluated computing 2600 valid models of @xmath1 cen b and including also the uncertainty in the capture rate @xmath55 from variations in the dm halo parameters and the stellar velocity , as discussed in section  [ sec - dmstars ] .",
    "the dashed lines around the @xmath54 line are not shown for clarity , but they would appear narrower because @xmath46 varies more abruptly in that region of the plot .",
    "therefore , we conclude that present asteroseismic measurements of @xmath1 cen b disfavor the existence of dm particles with parameters above the @xmath53 line with 95% confidence level .    similarly , the presence of a convective core leads to strong asteroseismic signatures .",
    "the mixing of elements in convective regions introduces sharp structural variations in the border with radiative regions that produce a clear oscillatory signal in the frequency spectrum .",
    "it has been shown that this feature may be used to detect and measure the size of a convective core through asteroseismic parameters such as @xmath56 , @xmath57 or @xmath58  .",
    "if these asteroseismic diagnostic tools succeed in the confirmation of the presence or the absence of a convective core in a star with 1.1 - 1.3 m@xmath0 , this hypothetical measurement may be used to place further constraints on the nature of the dm particles .",
    "the characteristic and localised effects of dm should allow the disentanglement of its signatures from standard processes .",
    "remarkably , several stars with the appropriate characteristics are presently being observed by the _ corot _ and _ kepler _ missions .     of the dm - modified stellar models from the true value measured in @xmath1 cen b. all the stellar models are calibrated to fit the @xmath47 , @xmath49 , @xmath48 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 of @xmath1 cen b within the observational error .",
    "the dashed black lines around the @xmath53 line show the uncertainty in @xmath46 arising from the observational error in the stellar characteristics.[fig - ssacb ] ]",
    "we have shown the strong signatures that asymmetric dm particles with low masses and large sd scattering cross sections with baryons produce on low - mass stars .",
    "we have focused in the study of the stars kic 8006161 , hd 52265 and @xmath1 cen b , revealing large modifications in the central temperatures and densities of the models and the suppression of the convective core expected in 1.1 - 1.3  m@xmath0 stars .    in the case of @xmath1 cen b",
    ", we have shown that the asteroseismic parameter @xmath46 can be used to impose competitive constraints to the dm characteristics .",
    "in particular , we were able to exclude with 95% confidence level adm candidates with @xmath59gev and @xmath60@xmath35 .",
    "these new constraints are comparable with the present limits from direct detection experiments ( @xmath61@xmath35 for @xmath59gev , see  @xcite ) because the sensitivity of the detectors drops at low wimp masses .",
    "interestingly , low - mass wimps with similar characteristics have been advocated to explain the signals in the dama / libra and cogent detectors in terms of sd collisions . in adm models the low mass of the wimps",
    "is strongly motivated because the relic density of dm is determined by the baryon asymmetry of the universe , leading to @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "our approach may provide a complementary test of these low - mass wimp models , in the context of controversy over the incompatible results between different direct detection experiments .",
    "asteroseismology thus arises as a promising strategy for indirect dm searches . compared to helioseismology",
    ", the asteroseismic searches of dm allow the study of stars with masses lower than that of the sun , which are more strongly influenced by the additional cooling mechanism provided by the dm particles .",
    "in addition , the asteroseismic confirmation of the presence or the absence of convective cores in 1.1 - 1.3  m@xmath0 stars , such as hd 52265 , may provide further constraints on the nature of dm .",
    "the future perspectives of this approach are also exciting . if the small frequency spacings are identified in the oscillations of stars located in environments with high expected dm densities , such as globular clusters , then the sensitivity of the approach proposed in this work will reach much smaller wimp - proton scattering cross sections and larger wimp masses .",
    "moreover , in the event of a successful identification of the properties of dm after hypothetical positive results in different experiments , asteroseismology may allow the determination of the density of dm at any specific location where a star is observed .",
