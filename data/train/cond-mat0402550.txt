    "the pseudogap phase is one of the most interesting and unconventional regimes observed in the underdoped cuprate superconductors .",
    "such a phenomenon has been identified @xcite in nmr , arpes , neutron - scattering , transport , optical conductivity and other experiments , which are absent in the traditional bcs superconductivity .",
    "the physical origin of such a pseudogap state remains controversial , with the proposed ones ranging from the rvb pairing @xcite , the loss of the phase coherence in the superconducting order parameter @xcite , preformed electron pairing @xcite , to the d - density - wave theory ddw , etc .",
    "a good understanding of the essential physics involved in the pseudogap phase will be of great importance in searching for a sensible microscopic theory of the high-@xmath1 cuprates .    in this paper , we propose to study the detailed driving mechanisms behind the pseudogap phase .",
    "so far , different driving mechanisms for the superconducting condensation have been studied extensively in literature @xcite .",
    "as to be shown in this work , the nature of a pseudogap phase can be also meaningfully clarified by identifying , both experimentally and theoretically , whether it is kinetic - energy - driven or potential - energy - driven .",
    "specifically we shall focus ourselves on the pseudogap phases based on the @xmath0 model .",
    "such a model is composed of two terms : @xmath2 ( see sec .",
    "ii ) , where the kinetic term is denoted by @xmath3 and the superexchange term by @xmath4 . then one can ask whether the pseudogap state , if exists , is mainly driven by @xmath3 or @xmath5 and how different possible driving mechanisms can be probed and verified ( falsified ) by experimental measurements .",
    "firstly we shall establish a very general relationship between the optical conductivity and the kinetic and superexchange energies in the @xmath0 model . an important but subtle difference between the kinetic terms of the @xmath0 model and the hubbard model",
    "will be carefully examined and distinguished . in a single - band hubbard model",
    ", the optical sum rule is generally given bysumrule @xmath6where @xmath7 is the real part of the optical conductivity and @xmath8 is some high - energy cutoff ( higher than the hubbard - mott gap ) . on the right - hand - side ( rhs )",
    ", @xmath9 is the kinetic energy of the hubbard model , @xmath10 is the lattice constant , and @xmath11 is the volume . in the case of the @xmath0 model ( _ i.e. , _ the large-@xmath12 hubbard model ) , the kinetic energy @xmath13 can be replaced by @xmath14 if @xmath8 is taken as some characteristic energy cutoff @xmath15 below which _ only _ no - double - occupancy intraband transitions of charges are allowed .",
    "however , if @xmath8 is taken to be larger such that to allow the transitions to doubly occupied states , then the rhs of eq.([sumrule1 ] ) will include additional contribution beside @xmath16 from the kinetic energy of the hubbard model , which , as we will show in sec .",
    "ii , is nothing but @xmath17 twice of the superexchange energy of the @xmath0 model !",
    "thus , by properly choosing the magnitudes of @xmath8 and @xmath18 respectively , the optical data can provide crucial information on _ both _ the kinetic energy and superexchange energy of the @xmath0 model and be effectively used to deduce the driving mechanisms for both pseudogap and superconducting states . as to be discussed in sec .",
    "ii , the recent optical measurement results @xcite in the cuprate @xmath19 can be read off , based on the present analysis , as strong evidence in support of the kinetic - energy - driven mechanism for _ both _ superconducting _ _  _ _ and pseudogap phases .",
    "then we shall study two distinct pseudogap phases defined in different mean - field theories of the @xmath0 model , _",
    "i.e. , _ the slave - boson rvb @xcite and bosonic rvb ( b - rvb ) @xcite mean - field states , respectively , which will be introduced in sec",
    "then , we show that the pseudogap phase in the slave - boson rvb state is superexchange - energy - driven , while it is kinetic - energy - driven in the b - rvb state .",
    "the underlying physics is then explored in a comparative way in sec .",
    "iv .    a detailed study of the static and dynamic spin susceptibility functions in sec .",
    "iv reveals how the af correlations evolve between the pseudogap and normal  phases . in the slave - boson rvb state ,",
    "the af correlations near @xmath20 are intrinsically weak in the normal  state and by opening the rvb gap to enter the pseudogap phase , the superexchange energy will be reduced , whereas the kinetic energy simultaneously gets increased .",
    "in contrast , the af correlations near @xmath20 are already quite strong in the normal  state of the b - rvb state such that the kinetic energy is very frustrated . by going into the pseudogap phase ,",
    "the kinetic energy will get improved with suppressing af correlations , which simultaneously results in an increase of the superexchange energy .",
    "thus , whether a pseudogap phase in the @xmath0 model is kinetic - energy - driven or superexchange - energy - driven crucially depends on which one of the kinetic energy and af correlations gets released  from a suppression  status in the normal  state .    experimentally , the superexchange energy of@xmath21 will be related to the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) spin - spin correlations , which can be decided by the imaginary dynamic spin susceptibility @xmath22 measurable by an inelastic neutron - scattering measurement , through the following sum rule @xmath23where @xmath24 previously , based on this relation , arguments for superexchange - energy - driven superconductivity have been made in literature based on the neutron - scattering measurements .",
    "in particular , the so(5 ) theory suggests @xcite that the superconducting transition in the high-@xmath1 superconductors is driven by the superexchange energy gain as the so called @xmath25- resonance mode neutron1 opens a new channel for af spin fluctuations in the superconducting state .",
    "but for both the slave - boson rvb and b - rvb theories of the @xmath0 model , the superconductivity is always kinetic - energy - driven .",
    "the b - rvb theory goes further to predict that the pseudogap phase is also kinetic - energy - driven , in which the resonance - like peak observed in @xmath26 by neutron - scattering neutron1,neutron2,so53 is not interpreted as an emergent new mode , rather it simply comes from the low - lying spin excitations in the normal  state , which are pushed upwards to a _ higher energy _ and become sharpened in the pseudogap phase . in other words , if the normal  state is extrapolated  into zero temperature , strong af correlations near @xmath27 or even an af long - range order can appear as evidenced by the non - korringa behavior of the nmr @xmath28 both calculated ( sec .",
    "iv ) and observed experimentally in the cuprates .",
    "therefore , in combination with the aforementioned optical measurements , the experiments seem overall in favor of the mechanism of kinetic - energy - driven as the origin of the pseudogap phase .    in sec .",
    "ii , the optical sum rules for the hubbard and @xmath0 models are discussed and a comparison with experiment is made . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce and discuss two pseudogap phases in the slave - boson rvb and b - rvb theories based on the @xmath0 model , and in sec .",
    "iv , we present a comparative study of the pseudogap phases in two rvb mean - field states .",
    "finally a discussion and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "the hubbard model is defined by    @xmath29    in the large-@xmath12 limit , the hubbard model can be reduced @xcite to the @xmath30 model in the low - energy subspace of no double occupancy .",
    "this is usually done by dividing the hilbert space into the low - energy subspace of no double occupancy and the high - energy subspace with doubly occupied sites . in the large-@xmath12 limit ,",
    "two subspaces are separated by a gap of order of @xmath12 .",
    "correspondingly , the hamiltonian can be divided into intra - subspace and inter - subspace pieces . introducing the projection operator @xmath31 and @xmath32for the low - energy subspace and high - energy subspace , respectively",
    ", the hubbard hamiltonian can be written as    @xmath33    in which    @xmath34    are the terms in the low - energy subspace , high - energy subspace , and the subspace - mixing term , respectively .",
    "the subspace - mixing term can be removed by a canonical transformation @xmath35 @xcite . to",
    "the first order of @xmath36 , the transformed hamiltonian in the low energy subspace is the standard @xmath0 model    @xmath37 p_{l } \\\\ & \\equiv h_{t - j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 with the kinetic term @xmath3 and the superexchange term @xmath4 defined by    @xmath39    @xmath40    where @xmath41 ( here @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    under the above canonical transformation ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the hubbard model is transformed into@xmath45 in the low - energy subspace to the first order of @xmath46 .",
    "the potential energy of the hubbard model transforms into    @xmath47    in the low - energy subspace to the same order .",
    "note that the transformed form of @xmath48 is still positive - definite .    from these formulas",
    ", we can explicitly see an important but subtle difference between the kinetic energy in the @xmath0 model and that of the underlying hubbard model .",
    "note that @xmath3 solely contributes to the charge response in the @xmath0 model with @xmath4 as charge neutral in the subspace of no double occupancy . according to eq.([k ] ) , however , the @xmath49 _ energy _ of the hubbard model includes not only the kinetic term @xmath3 of the @xmath0 model , but also an _ additional",
    "_ term , which happens to be twice of the superexchange term @xmath4 .",
    "namely , the kinetic energy  term @xmath3 in the @xmath0 model does not represent the _ whole _ kinetic energy of the hubbard model .",
    "physically , this is due to the fact that no matter how large @xmath12 is , as long as it is finite , the lower - hubbard band does not exactly correspond to the no double occupancy subspace and , to the leading order approximation of @xmath50 , the correction @xmath51 in eq.([k ] ) originates from the _ virtual _ transitions of charge carriers to the doubly occupied states , which only vanishes at @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the kinetic energy at the level of the hubbard model is different from the kinetic energy in the @xmath0 model .",
    "due to such a subtle difference , one has to distinguish the terminology of kinetic energy driven vs. superexchange energy driven  at the level of the @xmath0 model from kinetic energy driven vs. potential energy driven  at the level of the hubbard model to avoid confusion , which has been correctly noted @xcite before .    in the optical sum rule ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the hubbard model is related to the total optical response in eq.([sumrule1 ] ) . according to the preceding discussion , the total optical weight of the hubbard model",
    "is then composed of two contributions , namely the optical response within the subspace of no double occupancy and the optical response involving doubly occupied sites .",
    "the first contribution is just the optical response of the @xmath0 model , contributed by @xmath54 according to the optical sum rule , this contribution is related to kinetic energy of the @xmath0 model in the following way    @xmath55    here an energy cutoff @xmath15 is a characteristic scale below which the charge response of the hubbard model is equivalent to that of the @xmath0 model .",
    "the additional kinetic energy in eq . ( [ k ] ) involving doubly occupied states should be determined by the optical weight between @xmath15 and @xmath56 as given by    @xmath57    which is thus related to the superexchange energy of the @xmath0 model ! therefore ,",
    "if we can determine the energy cutoff @xmath8 and @xmath15 , we can read off both the kinetic energy and the superexchange energy of the @xmath30 model from the optical data .    recently , optical measurements in the cuprate @xmath19 have revealed @xcite a continuous spectral weight transfer from the high energy part to the low energy part of the in - plane optical conductivity with decreasing temperature , in both optimally doped and underdoped samples .",
    "an characteristic energy scale @xmath58 @xmath59 has been identified , which corresponds to the minimum of the in - plane optical conductivity in the experiment .",
    "below and above it , the integrated optical conductivity behaves in opposite ways as a function of temperature .",
    "namely , the spectral weight between @xmath58 @xmath59 to @xmath60 @xmath59 transfers steadily to below @xmath58 @xmath59 with decreasing temperature , while the total spectral weight remains approximately conserved @xcite .    if we take @xmath58 @xmath59 as the energy cutoff @xmath15 for the @xmath0 model described above and adopt @xmath60",
    "@xmath59 as @xmath61 below which reliable optical data is available @xcite , then the experimental result consistently indicates that , starting well above and persisting below @xmath62 the kinetic energy of the @xmath0 model is continuously lowered whereas the superexchange energy is increased with decreasing temperature according to eqs.([op2 ] ) and ( [ op3 ] ) .",
    "such experimental results can be thus read off as evidence in support of the kinetic - energy - driven mechanism for _ both _ superconducting _ _  _ _ and pseudogap phases , so long as the @xmath0 model is relevant to the cuprates with the energy cutoff of @xmath63 @xmath59 representing the characteristic energy scale for the intraband transitions within the no - double - occupancy subspace .",
    "note that the value of the energy cutoff @xmath8 of the hubbard model is subjected to some uncertainty , but this may not matter much since  the spectral weight approximately remains conserved as a function of temperature with @xmath64 @xmath59 as stated above .    the steady increase of the superexchange energy with decreasing temperature seems at odd with the conventional understanding of the pseudogap as some kind of spin pairing gap forming , driven by the exchange energy of the @xmath0 model .",
    "this indicates that the kinetic energy of the @xmath0 model plays an important role in the formation of the pseudogap @xcite . in the next section",
    ", we shall investigate the detailed driving mechanisms for pseudogap phases in the @xmath0 model based on two different mean - field theories and explore the underlying physics in comparison with experiment .",
    "finally we note that a closer examination on the experimental data shows that both kinetic and superexchange energies change more rapidly upon entering the superconducting state .",
    "this shows convincingly that the superconducting transition is kinetic energy driven while the exchange energy resists the transition .",
    "also , we note that since the kinetic energy and superexchange energy evolve in opposite directions with temperature , the true superconducting condensation energy should be smaller than that estimated from the kinetic energy alone .",
    "furthermore as the superconducting transition usually simultaneously involves the interlayer coherent hopping in the cuprates , one needs to further consider the @xmath65-axis conductivity in order to determine whether the intra or interlayer kinetic energy will predominantly `` drive '' the superconductivity@xcite , if it is kinetic - energy - driven .",
    "nevertheless , in the present work we shall be mainly interested in the formation of the pseudogap phase above @xmath1 , where the out - of - plane physics is no longer as crucial , and one can thus mainly focus on the in - plane physics .",
    "in the slave - boson formalism of the @xmath0 model , the electron operator can be written as @xcite @xmath66where @xmath67 is a bosonic holonoperator and @xmath68 a fermionic spinon  operator .",
    "they satisfy the no - double - occupancy constraint @xmath69 at each lattice site .",
    "the pseudogap phase in the rvb mean - field theory based on this slave - boson formalism is characterized by a d - wave order parameter for the spinon pairing @xcite    @xmath70    which is finite at small doping below a characteristic temperature @xmath71 .",
    "the pseudogap phase is defined in the temperature regime of @xmath72 , where the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 is decided by the holon  condensation ( @xmath73 ) temperature in this mean - field description .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram @xcite is schematically shown in fig .",
    "1 .    note that in the rvb mean - field theory @xcite , besides the rvb order parameter ( [ sb2 ] ) , one also needs to introduce the following order parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 the detailed mean - field results concerning the pseudogap phase will be presented in sec .",

    "bosonic _ operators .",
    "in such a _ bosonization _ description , the fermionic commutation relations of @xmath81 s can be restored by the phase - string factor @xmath82    as a distinctive feature of this decomposition , the definition of the phase - string factor is given by @xmath83 } $ ] , where @xmath84 , with @xmath85 and @xmath86 , while @xmath87 ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 are spinon and holon number operators . and @xmath90 , with @xmath91 ) it can be verified that the fermionic properties of @xmath81 s are ensured by such a phase factor under the no - double - occupancy constraint @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 .    the pseudogap phase in the bosonic - rvb ( b - rvb ) state @xcite based on the phase - string formalism is defined as follows .",

    "thus ,  compared to the slave - boson mean - field theory , the superconducting order parameter has an extra phase factor @xmath99 in eq.([ps2 ] ) .",
    "when the holons experience a bose condensation , with @xmath73 , the state is not necessarily superconducting , if the phase @xmath100 still remains disordered.string3,string4    let us examine this from a top - downapproach .",
    "we note that the b - rvb order parameter @xmath98 will first form at high temperature @xmath101 ( @xmath102 at small @xmath103 ) .",

    "the pseudogap phase sets in below @xmath107 when the bosonic holons experience the bose condensation and thus the amplitude of the cooper pairing forms ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "eventually the superconducting phase is realized when the phase coherence is achieved .",
    "note that the phase coherence factor in eq.([ps2 ] ) is absent in the slave - boson rvb theory . ]",
    "then the pseudogap phase in this framework is defined by @xcite @xmath109the pairing amplitude @xmath110 becomes finite at a temperature @xmath111 at which the bosonic holons are bose condensed .",
    "on the other hand , the superconducting transition occurs at @xmath1 when the phase coherence is realized @xcite in eq.([ps2 ] ) , as the spinon - vortices  in @xmath100 are bound together such that @xmath100 is cancelled out at large - distance scales .",
    "note that the pseudogap phase between @xmath112 is also called _ spontaneous vortex phase _ in ref .",
    "@xcite since free spinon - vortices are unbound in such a regime where the phase @xmath100 in eq.([ps2 ] ) is disordered ( @xmath107 is denoted by @xmath113 in ref .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that these free spinon - vortices will contribute to the nernst effect observed experimentally .",
    "different from the standard slave - boson mean - field theory , the spinon and holon degrees of freedom in the b - rvb theory are intrinsically entangled  together , which will be quite essential in the following discussion of the properties of the pseudogap phase .",
    "we shall first briefly discuss the basic theoretical structure of this model below .",
    "the low - energy effective hamiltonian @xmath114 derived @xcite from the phase - string formalism of the @xmath0 model ( with @xmath115 and @xmath116 corresponding to the hopping term @xmath3 and the superexchange term @xmath4 , respectively ) under the bosonic rvb order parameter @xmath98 is given by @xmath117@xmath118where @xmath119 and @xmath120 with @xmath121    an important feature of this effective model is a mutual entanglement between the charge and spin degrees of freedom as mediated by the gauge fields , @xmath122 and @xmath123 which satisfy the following topological constraints   @xmath124and @xmath125for a closed loop @xmath65 .",
    "thus , a spinonalways sees a holon  as a @xmath25 fluxoid and a holon  perceives a spinon  as a @xmath126 fluxoid ( @xmath127 depends on the spin index ) .    in the pseudogap phase where the holons experience a bose condensation , @xmath128 can be reduced to a vector field describing a uniform flux satisfying @xmath129then @xmath116 in ( [ ps6 ] ) can be easily diagonalized.@xcite in such a case , a characteristic spinon gap ( thus a spin gap ) will be opened up and the af correlations will be suppressed at low energy ( see sec .",
    "since the majority of spinons remain in rvb pairing at low temperatures , @xmath130 will be substantially cancelled out in eq.([ps8 ] ) , which in turn is in favor of the holon condensation in @xmath115 _ in a self - consistent way_. so in the pseudogap phase , _ the kinetic energy of the holons is expected to get improved at the expense of the af correlations _ according to the phase - string description .    on the other hand , in the normal  state where the holon condensation is gone , the spinon gap will disappear and there will be _ strong fluctuations _ in @xmath122 due to unpaired @xmath131 fluxoid bound to _ thermally _ _ excited _ spinons in terms of eq.([ps8 ] ) .",
    "this will then lead to a great deal of frustrations on the holon part through @xmath132 again self - consistently , causing__holons lose phase coherence and behave incoherently__. in contrast to such a frustration of the kinetic energy of the charge carriers , strong af correlations will be _ restored _ in @xmath133instead@xmath134 where the gauge field @xmath135 can no longer treated as in eq.([uflux ] ) , but rather as describing @xmath25 fluxoids bound to randomly distributed holons according to eq.([ps9 ] ) , whose frustration effects on the af correlations are found to be _ minimal _ , in contrast to the case of eq.([uflux ] ) in the pseudogap phase .",
    "therefore , one will find a distinctive interplay between the charge and spin degrees of freedom in the pseudogap state and normal  state based on the framework of the b - rvb theory , characterized by eqs.([ps5 ] ) and ( [ ps6 ] ) .",
    "namely , the af correlations and the kinetic energy are mutually repulsive to each other , whose competition becomes the driving force for the formation of the pseudogap phase at low temperatures .",
    "the detailed results will be presented in the following section .",
    "in the above we have introduced the definitions of pseudogap state in two different mean - field approaches in the @xmath0 model . in this section ,",
    "we explore and compare the driving mechanisms for such pseudogap states in the slave - boson and b - rvb descriptions , respectively , and show that two mechanisms are drastically distinct .",
    "namely , one is exchange - energe - driven and the other is kinetic - energy - driven .",
    "let us consider the superexchange energy and examine the change of the superexchange energy during the formation of a pseudogap state according to the mean - field theories outlined in sec .",
    "firstly let us focus on the pseudogap state in the slave - boson rvb theory , which is featured by the opening of the slave - boson rvb gap @xmath136 since the origin of @xmath104 comes entirely from @xmath4 , the superexchange energy is expected to be gained in the pseudogap phase .    the calculation based on the mean - field theory outlined in sec .",
    "iii is standard and straightforward @xcite .",
    "3(a ) shows the results calculated at @xmath137 in a @xmath138 square lattice .",
    "clearly the superexchange energy is reduced with @xmath139 ( solid curve ) as compared to the state with @xmath140 ( dotted curve ) below the onset temperature @xmath107 .     in ( a ) and @xmath141 in ( b ) . ]    the result that the pseudogap phase is superexchange - energy - driven in the slave - boson theory is within the expectation as mathematically the fermionic spinon part closely resembles a bcs mean - field state where the attractive potential is obviously the driving force .",
    "such a fact should remain true even if one includes the gauge fluctuations in both and formalisms@xcite .",
    "usually the gauge fluctuations will get suppressed in the pseudogap phase with the opening of the gap @xmath142 such a competition between the pseudogap @xmath143 and gauge fluctuations may quantitatively modify the superexchange energy , but not the driving mechanism itself .",
    "now let us consider the b - rvb state , in which the pseudogap phase is marked by the occurrence of the holon condensation . as discussed in sec .",
    "iii b , the corresponding effect of the holon condensation on the superexchange energy will be mediated through the topological gauge field @xmath135 in eq.(ps6 ) .",
    "let us consider two extreme limits . in one limit ,",
    "let all holons be condensed such that @xmath135 describes a uniform flux [ eq.([uflux ] ) ] , which is deep in the pseudogap regime . in the opposite limit ,",

    "3(b ) illustrates the superexchange energy determined by the mean - field solution of @xmath116 as a function of @xmath145 with @xmath135 being treated in the above - mentioned two limits , in a @xmath138 lattice . as shown by fig .",
    "3(b ) , it will always _ cost _ the superexchange energy going into the pseudogap state from the high-@xmath146 normal  state .",
    "note that in the temperature range between these two limits , @xmath135 itself should behave more complicated than the above simple - minded treatments , which in general involves the holon dynamics .",

    "3(b ) should be reliable , which unambiguously indicate that the pseudogap state is formed at the expense of the superexchange energy in the b - rvb theory , in contrast to the superexchange - energy - driven picture for the slave - boson mean - field theory shown in fig .",

    "in the deep pseudogap limit , one may simply treat @xmath152 and the holons as non - interacting bosons@xmath150 in the high - temperature normal  state , one can treat @xmath122 as describing @xmath126 flux - tubes bound to free spinons , which are randomly distributed on lattice to simulate those excited from the rvb background with a number @xmath153 . generally @xmath154 should increase with the temperature . for our purpose , we can define a prototype normal  state with @xmath155 fixed at @xmath156 ( note that @xmath157 at @xmath158 @xcite ) , and calculate the average kinetic energy @xmath159 as a function of temperature .",
    "4(b ) shows the results .",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath160  does decrease with the decrease of @xmath161 which means that with the decrease of the temperature , the kinetic energy of holons will get continuously improved due to the suppression of the fluctuations in @xmath162 again the realistic case will be some kind of interpolation between the solid curves shown in fig .",
    "but it does not change the general trend that the kinetic energy will be gained by entering the pseudogap phase , _",
    "i.e. _ , a kinetic - energy - driven mechanism , which is consistent with the loss of the superexchange energy discussed earlier on .",
    "finally , we have computed the optical conductivity in the b - rvb theory .",
    "based on the same approximation in dealing with @xmath115 above , the optical conductivity is obtained in fig .",
    "5 for two cases of the pseudogap and normal  states with @xmath163 and @xmath164 respectively .",
    "it shows that the low - energy spectral weight does increase in the pseudogap phase as compared to the normal state , in consistency with the kinetic energy behavior .",
    "the sharp contrast between the qualitative behaviors of the superexchange and kinetic energies in two mean - field theories is quite remarkable , as they are supposed to describe the same @xmath0 model . in the following ,",
    "we analyze the detailed spin - spin correlations in order to understand the physics underlying such distinctions .",
    "the uniform spin susceptibility @xmath165 in the cuprates has generally exhibited a suppression at low temperatures in the underdoped phase .",
    "this behavior has served as one @xcite of the main experimental evidence for the existence of a pseudgap above @xmath1 .    in the slave - boson rvb theory",
    ", the opening of the rvb gap @xmath166 will naturally result in the suppression of @xmath165 at low temperature as shown in fig .",
    "similarly , in the b - rvb state , the uniform spin susceptibility @xmath165 also shows a continuous reduction at low temperatures , as given in fig .",
    "6(b ) , where the curves calculated in the two limits of the pseudogap and normalstates ( corresponding to fig .",
    "3(b ) ) are presented for comparison .",
    "here we see that the pseudogap behavior in the uniform spin susceptibility is not very sensitive to the detailed mechanisms and the general trend remains essentially the same .",
    "this implies that the density of spin states near momentum @xmath167 is indeed universally suppressed in both cases .",
    "however , the situation will become quite different when we consider spin - spin correlations near the af momentum @xmath20 below@xmath150    .",
    "the @xmath146-axis is scaled with @xmath147 in ( a ) and @xmath168 in ( b ) . ]",
    "the superexchange energy is related to the equal - time nn spin - spin correlations in the @xmath0 model . in the salve - boson rvb mean - field state , the equal - time",
    "the spin - spin correlation function is shown in fig .",
    "an enhancement of the nn spin correlations is the direct reason that the superexchange energy is gained in the pseudogap state .",
    "it is noted that the overall af correlations are quite weak for both the normal and pseudogap states in fig .",
    "7(a ) , which can be visibly strengthened after the gutzwiller projection is applied .",
    "similarly , one can compute the equal - time spin correlation function in the b - rvb description .",
    "the results for the pseudogap and normal states are presented in fig .",
    "7(b ) , respectively , in the two limits shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , indicates that the spin - spin correlations are clearly suppressed in the pseudogap state , which is responsible for the increase of the superexchange energy in fig .",
    "3(b ) .    .",
    "]    at this step , we can see that the main distinction between two pseudogap states is closely related to the af correlations . in the slave - boson mean - field state",
    ", the short - range af correlations are rather weak in the normal state , and by opening an rvb gap , the spin - spin correlations near @xmath169 will get improved ( note that the comparison is made at the _ same _ temperature by extrapolation to @xmath170 ) .",
    "this general trend will not be altered even if one introduces the gutzwiller projection , although the overall af correlations can be enhanced by the projection for _ both _ cases .",
    "in contrast , the af correlations in the normal phase of the b - rvb state are already quite strong , and are always suppressed by entering the pseudogap phase , thus leading to the superexchange - energy loss .",
    "so the change of the af correlations will hold the key to understanding the mechanisms for the above pseudogap phases . generally speaking , weak af correlations in the spin background favor the hopping of the holes .",
    "this is the reason why the kinetic energy in the slave - boson mean - field state is better in the normal state , whereas is reduced as the rvb gap @xmath143 opens up with the improved short - range af correlations . on the other hand , the af correlations are much stronger in the normal phase of the b - rvb state , which is not in favor of the kinetic energy .",
    "so the holons can only hop incoherently under the influence of the randomly distributed @xmath171 fluxoids via @xmath172 in the phase - string description . in the pseudogap phase of the b - rvb state , the hopping of the holons becomes coherent and",
    "the holons are condensed with better kinetic energies , at the expenses of the af correlations which become gapped ( fig . 8 below ) .    in the following",
    ", the change in the af oscillations of @xmath173 can be further analyzed in terms of the weight transfer in the dynamic susceptibility function @xmath174 at different energies for a fixed @xmath175 according to the fourier transformation of eq.([sumrule2 ] ) .      in the pseudogap phase based on the bosonic rvb description ,",
    "the equal - time af correlations have been shown to be suppressed . in the following ,",
    "we further investigate how such a suppression is exhibited as a function of the frequency @xmath177 near the af momentum @xmath178    fig .",
    "8 shows @xmath179 at @xmath180 in the two extreme limits of the pseudogap and normal  states shown in fig .",
    "note that the temperature is set at zero for both cases , just for convenience . in the pseudogap phase ,",
    "a resonance - peak at @xmath181 emerges around @xmath182 at @xmath183 in the previous work , @xcite such a sharp - peak structure has been used to explain the so - called @xmath184 @xmath185 resonance - like peak observed by the inelastic neutron - scattering in the optimal - doped compound @xcite , where @xmath107 seems to coincide with @xmath186 a broader peak feature has been also found @xcite in the underdoped compounds at @xmath187 and the present theory provides a natural description .",
    "note that the sharpness of the peak in fig .",
    "8 is due to the artifact in treating the gauge field @xmath135 by assuming the holons are all in an ideal bose condensation .",
    "it can be easily broadened once the density fluctuations of holons are considered .",
    "the resonance - like peak around @xmath149 disappears in fig .",
    "8 in the normal  state when the holon coherence is gone and the holons behave like incoherent objects , such that @xmath135 can be treated as describing randomly distributed @xmath25 flux - tubes as discussed in sec .",
    "iii b. the dashed curve show the corresponding result artificially extrapolated to @xmath188 with the remaining spectral weight at @xmath189 shifting down to the low frequency @xmath190 this is consistent with the fact that the af correlations will be enhanced in the normal  state .    .",
    "a resonance - like peak is found an energy @xmath191 in the pseudogap phase , which disappears in the high-@xmath146 normal  state where the weight in @xmath192 is shifted to @xmath193 when is extrapolated to @xmath194 the @xmath195-axis is in units of @xmath196 . ]",
    "we can further study the af correlations near @xmath27 by calculating @xmath197 at @xmath198 and @xmath199 note that such a quantity is related to the nmr spin relaxation rate @xmath28 for @xmath200nuclear spins ( a @xmath201-dependent hyperfine coupling factor is neglected here for simplicity ) .",
    "the results for the two extreme limits considered before are shown in fig .",
    "9 : the main panel is for the normal  state  case , which demonstrates a non - korringa behavior often observed @xcite in the cuprates due to strong af correlations near @xmath202 and @xmath190 by contrast , a spin gap behavior of @xmath28 also seen in experiment @xcite is indeed exhibited in the pseudogap state as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "9 . both are qualitatively consistent with the experimental measurements in the cuprate superconductors .     at @xmath203",
    "is shown as a function of @xmath146 in the b - rvb theory@xmath150 such a quantity is approximately related to the spin relaxation rate in nmr measurement . ]",
    "so far we have only considered the dynamic spin susceptibility function based on the b - rvb theory .",
    "note that the af correlations are generally quite weak in the slave - boson mean - field theory [ see fig .",
    "7(a ) ] and there are not much features near @xmath202 to give rise to the experimentally interested properties like @xmath204 etc , at the mean - field level .",
    "one has really go beyond the mean - field approximation here .",
    "for example , a resonance - like peak structure around @xmath202 has been obtained in the superconducting phase after a modified random - phase - approximation approach @xcite .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "nevertheless , the conclusion that the superexchange energy will be _ gained _ by the opening of the pseudogap @xmath205 should still hold true , as discussed in sec .",
    "iv a , as responsible by an enhancement of the equal - time ( frequency - integrated ) spin correlations at a large momentum around @xmath206 [ opposed to the suppression of the uniform susceptibility near ( @xmath207 $ ] .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the recent optical measurements of the cuprates have clearly demonstrated that both the pseudogap and superconducting phases are driven by the kinetic energy within the @xmath0 model description , based on a general consideration of the optical sum rule in the hubbard model and its relation to the @xmath0 model .",
    "under such an analysis , by entering the pseudogap phase , the superexchange energy of the @xmath30 model should get suppressed instead .",
    "then , we have examined two pseudogap phases obtained in the slave - boson rvb and b - rvb mean - field states of the @xmath0 model .",
    "although the uniform spin susceptibility is universally suppressed in both cases , which is consistent with experiment , the underlying driving mechanisms for the pseudogap phases are found to be precisely opposite .",
    "namely , it is superexchange - energy - driven in the slave - boson rvb theory as opposed to the kinetic - energy - driven in the b - rvb theory . if the above general consideration based on the optical sum rules",
    "is correct , then we conclude that the superexchange - energy - driven mechanism in the slave - boson rvb state is not supported experimentally .",
    "the distinction between the two cases is very basic and physically revealing .",
    "it can be traced back to the central issue concerning the af correlations . in the high-@xmath146 phase ( normal  state ) of the slave - boson mean - field state ,",
    "the af correlations are relatively quite weak , which is fairly favorable to the kinetic energy of holes as the latter can easily hop on the uniform rvb background . in the low-@xmath146 phase ( pseudogap state ) , an rvb pairing of spinons emerges , which improves the superexchange energy as well as the short - range af correlations ( or more precisely , the spin correlations at large - momenta ) , whereas the holes become less easy to hop around with the increasing kinetic energy .    by contrast",
    ", there already exist strong af correlations in the high-@xmath146 phase ( `` normal '' state ) of the b - rvb state , characterized by the b - rvb order parameter @xmath98 which can persist up to @xmath208 @xmath209 at low doping . in this regime ,",
    "the kinetic energy of holes is actually strongly suppressed and the holons behave like incoherent objects moving in a short - range af correlated spin background .",
    "this is quite different from the above slave - boson rvb state . only in the low-@xmath146 pseudogap phase",
    "can the phase coherence of the holons be restored with gaining the kinetic energy .",
    "it occurs at the expense of the low - energy af correlations , or the superexchange energy , and thus is entirely kinetic - energy - driven .",
    "mathematically , the whole interplay is straightforward in the slave - boson mean - field theory .",
    "however , the interplay in the b - rvb theory is different : due to the presence of strong af correlations , the low - energy effective theory is no longer a mean - field one by nature .",
    "the charge and spin degrees of freedom are generally _ entangled _ together by a mutual chern - simons - type gauge structure , reflecting the phase string effect as described in eqs.([ps5 ] ) and ( [ ps6 ] ) .",
    "thus the pseudogap and normal  states differ not simply by some mean - field order parameters , as in the slave - boson rvb states .    here",
    "strong af correlations will influence the hopping of holons through the topological gauge field @xmath210 as if each excited spinon is a @xmath25 fluxoid , which severely frustrate the phase coherence of the holons . on the other hand ,",
    "when the bosonic holons recover their phase coherence and are bose condensed at low-@xmath146 , they will affect the spinon degrees of freedom drastically through the topological gauge field @xmath135 in eq.([ps6 ] ) , going from a random distributed @xmath25 fluxoids bound to the incoherent holons at high-@xmath146 to the uniform flux given in eq.([uflux ] ) in the holon condensed ( pseudogap ) phase .",
    "the af correlations at low - energy is subsequently suppressed ( gapped ) in the pseudgap phase relative to the high-@xmath211 phase , pushing the weight up towards a higher energy @xmath149 to form a resonance - like  peak as shown in fig .",
    "8 and to result in the reduction of the nmr spin relaxation rate in fig.9 .",
    "self - consistently , the opening of the spinon gap at low - energies will substantially reduce the fluctuations of @xmath122 in the hopping term and improve the kinetic energy as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) as well as the low - energy optical conductivity in fig . 5 , which further strengths the holon bose condensation , and thus the pseudgap phase ."
