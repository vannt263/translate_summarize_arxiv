    "the effects of the earth s matter @xcite play a very important role in long - baseline and high - energy oscillation experiments , such as a neutrino factory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effect of variations in matter density and chemical composition along the baseline on the oscillation probability , which we call the matter profile effect , is also a controversial issue and has been debated in various contexts @xcite .    in the search for cp - violating effects",
    ", it is important to understand the structure of the earth so as to estimate precisely the fake signal induced by the earth s matter .",
    "some research @xcite has concluded that it is hard to obtain information about the interior of the earth through neutrino experiments using the currently assumed size of statistics and realistic detector configuration .",
    "therefore , the science of geophysics has been applied to support the analysis .",
    "much analysis has used the preliminary reference earth model ( prem ) @xcite , an earth model which is based on seismology .",
    "when we deal with such a model , we need to be conscious of the fact that the model includes uncertainty . in this paper , we discuss the fact that this uncertainty reduces the sensitivity of the cp violation and we show that it is not a small effect .    the procedure used to demonstrate our argument is as follows : firstly , we recapitulate the method of the fourier series expansion of the matter profile function @xcite in sec.[sec : fouriermethod ] . using this method , we show that only the first few modes are important in a high - energy experiment . furthermore , we mention the uncertainty included in the seismological earth models .",
    "we point out that a few percent error for the profile function can actually be interpreted as huge uncertainty for the fourier coefficients , which can affect the cp sensitivity .",
    "next , in sec.[sec : colleration ] , we show that there is a strong correlation between the constant matter parameter and the first fourier coefficient of the matter profile function within a wide energy and baseline region .",
    "this fact means that the uncertainty of the matter profile effect brings added uncertainty to the average matter density .",
    "then , we present numerical calculations to show quantitatively a loss of sensitivity induced by the uncertainty of the matter profile effect in sec.[sec : numerical ] .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec.[sec : summary ] .",
    "we would like to point out two facts in this section . _",
    "( 1 ) the most essential part of the matter profile effect is the first fourier mode of the matter profile function .",
    "( 2 ) the seismological earth models include great uncertainty for the first fourier mode .",
    "_ these facts force us to reconsider analyses in the baseline region which have so far assumed that the matter profile effect is not significant . in the case where the baseline length is 3,000 km",
    ", prem tells us that the matter profile function is almost flat and hence it can be expected that the matter profile effect is small .",
    "however , if we consider the uncertainty of prem , how will the analysis change ?      to see the effects induced by the matter profile , we derive the analytic expression using the method of the fourier series @xcite . expanding the matter profile function into the fourier modes",
    ", we obtain an extremely clear viewpoint for the resonance conditions between the oscillation lengths of the neutrino and the matter profile undulation . by this expansion",
    "we can understand which modes , and what structures , are effective .",
    "now , we introduce our calculation method .",
    "we assume three generations and parameterize the mixing matrix of the lepton sector , maki - nakagawa - sakata - pontecorvo matrix ( mnsp matrix ) , as follows ; @xmath1 here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the so - called majorana phase matrix , which does not contribute to the oscillation phenomena .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for neutrino propagation is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the squared - mass difference between the @xmath9th and @xmath10th generations in a vacuum .",
    "we separate the matter effect into two parts , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the effect of the average matter is denoted by @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the matter profile part , that is , the deviation part from the average density which depends on the position , @xmath13 .",
    "after the separation , we expand the matter profile part into the fourier series , @xmath14 note that the relation , @xmath15 is always satisfied because of the condition that @xmath12 is real . for anti - neutrino ,",

    "we also note in passing that the degree of freedom for so - called @xmath92 , which is often used in an estimation of the oscillation parameters , is not the number of the parameters since , for example , two strongly correlated parameters are not independent of each other , and hence we should count them as one parameter .",
    "indeed , as is commonly known , there are strong correlations for some parameters in the case we deal with",
    ". we should be more careful about what is a truly measurable quantity @xcite , and which quantities statistics are sensitive to @xcite .",
    "for instance , if the statistics can be constructed so as to be sensitive to the cp violating effect , then the parameter is only one , jarlskog s parameter , and the degree of freedom should be one .",
    "strictly speaking , only when the statistics are linearly dependent on the parameters , will the degree of freedom coincide with the number of the parameters .",
    "( 10,6.2 ) ( -0.2,5.9)@xmath93}$ ] ( 10.2,0.2)@xmath94     to draw a sensitivity plot , we assume 40 kt detector and @xmath95 muon decays in the neutrino factory scheme , and interpret eq . to the condition for @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "figure [ fig : cpsensitivityplot ] indicates the lower boundary of @xmath21 and @xmath98 @xmath99 to reject the hypotheses that @xmath17 is @xmath100 and @xmath101 at a 99% level of significance , when nature adopts the value @xmath102 in the case where the baseline length is 3,000 km , muon energy is 30 gev , the detection threshold is 5 gev and the width of energy bin is 2.5 gev ( 10 bin ) .",
    "the reference values are the same as those in fig.[fig : oscprob - prem - vs - a0 ] , except for @xmath21 and @xmath97 ; @xmath103    the dotted curve is calculated whilst considering the matter profile effect and its uncertainty up to the first fourier mode in the calculation of @xmath81 .",
    "we take 3% for @xmath11 and 200% for @xmath39 as the widths of uncertainty .",
    "the other curves are calculated assuming the constant matter profile with a different uncertainty for @xmath11 .",
    "the solid , dash - dot , and dashed curves correspond to @xmath104 0% , 3% and 5% , respectively . in the minimization process ,",
    "@xmath97 in @xmath81 is taken as an arbitrary value between @xmath105 , and the uncertainty of the other parameters is assumed , as in eq ..",
    "the dotted curve differs from the dash - dot curve in which the same uncertainty for @xmath11 is assumed , but that for @xmath106 is not included .",
    "in contrast , it is very similar to the dashed curve whose uncertainty for @xmath11 is larger ( 5% ) , but where a constant matter profile is assumed .",
    "this fact can be explained by the correlation between @xmath107 and @xmath106 eqs . and : _ uncertainty of @xmath39 is translated into that of @xmath11 through the correlation , and this extra uncertainty gives rise to an extra absorption of the signal of the cp violating effect .",
    "_ we know that the effect of the fake cp signal induced by the matter effect becomes more serious as @xmath98 increases , so if @xmath98 is measured just below the current boundary , we will have to take the effect induced by the density profile of the earth more seriously .    in the case of @xmath31 3,000 km , the determination of @xmath97 and the reduction of its uncertainty do not contribute towards improving the sensitivity much , since the matter effect itself is large at this baseline length .",
    "furthermore , lowering the detection threshold also hardly helps to improve the sensitivity because the number of events in the high - energy region is overwhelmingly greater than that in the low - energy region . if we can realize a lower detection threshold , an advantage can be gained with a shorter baseline length and a lower energy beam .",
    "( 10,6.2 ) ( -0.2,5.9)@xmath93}$ ] ( 10.2,0.2)@xmath94     figure [ fig : cpsensitivityplot-1000 km ] shows the sensitivity in the case where the baseline length is 1,000 km , the muon energy is 11 gev and the energy threshold is 1 gev . in this plot , the dotted curve represents the calculation using the up - to - first - mode profile and its widths of parameter uncertainty are @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and eq . for the others ,",
    "the solid curve is calculated by assuming a constant matter profile with @xmath108 , and the dash - dot curve is the same as the dotted one , except that @xmath97 in @xmath81 is assumed to be an arbitrary value between @xmath105 .    within the large @xmath98 region ,",
    "the sensitivity is better than that in fig.[fig : cpsensitivityplot ] .",
    "furthermore , the sensitivity of this choice is more robust against the uncertainty of the matter effect than in the case of @xmath31 3,000 km . in contrast",
    ", although the signal of the cp violation is also small in the small @xmath98 region , the fake cp violation effect induced by the matter effect is suppressed more strongly than the signal of the genuine cp violation , and hence , adopting a longer baseline and higher energy option may be advantageous to the cp violation search .",
    "this behavior does not come from the property of the statistics as defined by eq ..",
    "when the uncertainty of the constant matter parameter is assumed to be larger , the optimization , using so - called @xmath111 , also suggests that a shorter baseline length and lower energy is better ( see , for example o. yasuda , in ref@xcite ) .",
    "the existence of this correlation tells us that even though it is said that the uncertainty of the average matter density on the baseline is well estimated , this is not the entire uncertainty of the constant matter parameter .",
    "we would like to stress that the uncertainty of the matter effect is no longer so small when we introduce the matter profile effect .",
    "therefore , we should regard it more seriously whatever statistics we use , especially in the case where the main part of the neutrino beam path is the upper mantle and transition zone , including a large uncertainty for the density profile .",
    "we need to deal with the matter effect much more cautiously .",
    "we pointed out that there was a very strong correlation between the constant matter parameter , @xmath11 , and the first fourier coefficient of the matter profile function , @xmath39 , within a wide energy and baseline region .",
    "this fact means that the uncertainty of @xmath39 is translated into that of @xmath11 , and this gives added uncertainty to @xmath11 .",
    "we also showed that there is a huge uncertainty in @xmath106 .",
    "this is due to the fact that seismological earth models include a large uncertainty for the density profile in the region , the upper mantle and the transition zone , which is @xmath112 km in depth , and this uncertainty can cause a huge , even a few hundred percent , uncertainty for @xmath39 .",
    "the existence of the correlation suggests that this huge uncertainty affects cp sensitivity since , due to the correlation , the uncertainty in @xmath106 gives added uncertainty to @xmath11 .",
    "we present the sensitivity plot for the cp violation effect including the matter profile effect and its uncertainty . in the case where the baseline length is 3,000 km ,",
    "most of the path of the neutrino beam is occupied by the upper mantle , which includes large uncertainty .",
    "we show numerically that 200% uncertainty for @xmath39 can be interpreted as about 2% extra uncertainty for @xmath11 , which should be added to the original uncertainty of @xmath11 , and this result confirms our expectations from the correlation .",
    "this extra uncertainty makes the cp sensitivity worse , especially within the large @xmath98 region .",
    "a shorter baseline and lower energy option can avoid this disadvantage if the detection threshold can be lowered . on the contrary ,",
    "if small @xmath98 is established , then a long - baseline and high - energy option may be better than a shorter baseline and lower energy , because of the statistics .",
    "we made some comments in answer to questions about the statistics which we used .",
    "we consider the fact that the best - fit parameter suggested by the experiments is not always distributed only around the parameter chosen by nature .",
    "therefore , to discuss the feasibility of observing the cp violation effect , we need to consider this fact . this led us to use the concept , the power of test .    in this study ,",
    "we do not consider systematic uncertainty .",
    "of course , in order to optimize the experimental configurations , it is necessary to take account of systematic error .",
    "however , in any case , we can conclude that we should regard the uncertainty of the earth s matter as a more severe problem than that has so far been assumed .",
    "we need to be much more conservative when estimating the matter effect .",
