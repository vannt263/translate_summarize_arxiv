    "the recent technical advances made by demarco and jin  @xcite in the area of trapped , ultra - cold fermi gases , has led to the experimental realization of what is close to being an ideal , non - interacting , many - body system of harmonically confined fermions . using current state - of - the art magneto - optical traps , it is also now possible to `` tune '' the dimensionality of the gas from three - dimensions ( 3d ) to quasi-2d or quasi-1d .",
    "such a model system is of great interest to physicists , as it provides an opportunity to study the role of dimensionality , and the quantum statistical properties of a many - body system , exactly . as a result ,",
    "the last few years have seen a renewed interest in the theoretical description of harmonically trapped ideal fermi gases at both zero  @xcite and finite temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the primary focus of these studies has been on examining ( analytically and numerically ) the expressions for the _ local _ thermodynamic properties of the gas , e.g. , the single - particle and kinetic energy densities .",
    "these quantities are , of course , of great importance in the density - functional theory ( dft ) of inhomogeneous fermi systems , whereby one can by - pass the numerically expensive one - particle schrdinger equations .    however , the more fundamental quantity , from which the single - particle and kinetic energy densities are both derived , is the first - order density matrix @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , to date , there are relatively few examples in which a closed analytical form for @xmath1 can be written .",
    "one of the earliest examples dates back more than 60 years to husimi  @xcite , in which the zero temperature first - order density matrix of a 1d harmonic oscillator was derived .",
    "other examples that we are aware of are the so - called bardeen model  @xcite , corresponding to a planar metal surface , and the work of bhaduri and sprung  @xcite dealing with a 3d oscillator with a smeared occupancy .",
    "more recently , howard _ et .",
    "@xcite have evaluated the _ zero temperature _ first - order density matrix of the @xmath2-dimensional harmonic oscillator for an arbitrary number of closed shells .",
    "unfortunately , their form for @xmath1 is somewhat impractical in that it is given in terms of multidimensional integrals . while these integrals are numerically easy to evaluate , they are not very useful for further analytical analysis ( e.g , examining the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath3 as @xmath4  @xcite )",
    ".    one of the central theoretical reasons for pursuing a closed form expression for @xmath1 is that its off - diagonal elements determine the exchange integrals of two - body operators , and hence , the nonlocal properties of the system . from an experimental point of view , a closed form expression for @xmath1 is desirable because , e.g. , the momentum density @xmath5 ( which is just the fourier transform of the first - order density matrix ) , is experimentally accessible by measuring the line - shape in compton scattering .",
    "thus , in the case of a weakly - interacting harmonically confined fermi gas , an exact knowledge of @xmath1 can serve as a benchmark from which the effects of interparticle interactions may be extracted .",
    "the primary goal of this paper then , is to present an _",
    "exact _ closed form analytical expression for the finite temperature first - order density matrix of a harmonically confined ideal fermi in any dimension .",
    "we organize our paper as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review some of the basic definitions given in  @xcite , and then proceed to derive a closed form expression for the finite temperature first - order density matrix in arbitrary dimensions . following this calculation",
    ", we compare our exact @xmath1 with the tfa in 2d and discuss the applicability of the lda for describing the nonlocal properties of the 2d trapped gas .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iv , we apply our results to construct a closed form expression for the finite temperature hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange energy density of a parabolically confined 2d quantum dot .",
    "we numerically investigate this exact exchange energy density and comment on its applicability in the context of the lda . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we present a summary of our results and briefly highlight some interesting avenues for further investigation .",
    "in keeping with our our earlier work  @xcite , we begin by considering a system of noninteracting fermions at zero temperature described by the time - independent schrdinger equation _ i ( ) = [ + v()]_i ( ) = _ i _ i ( )  , where @xmath6 is a one - body potential to be specified later ( all @xmath7 s are taken to be positive ) .",
    "the ( spinless ) first - order density matrix can be obtained by an inverse laplace transform of the zero - temperature bloch density matrix , @xmath8 : _",

    "( [ onesided ] ) so that the laplace transform with respect to @xmath9 may formally be taken to be two - sided  @xcite .",
    "note that in quantum statistical mechanics , @xmath11 is usually identified with the inverse temperature , @xmath12 .",
    "however , in our present context , @xmath11 is to be interpreted as mathematical variable which in general is taken to be complex , and _ not _ the inverse temperature @xmath13 .    at finite temperature , the first - order density matrix is obtained from the bloch density matrix by using the relation  @xcite _ 1(_1,_2;t ) = l^-1 _  , [ rhot ] where c_t(_1,_2 ; ) = c_0(_1,_2 ; )  , [ blocht ] is the finite temperature bloch density matrix , and @xmath14 is the chemical potential . in eq .",

    "for the right panels ( which have @xmath54 ) , we note the same trend , but now with the agreement between the two expressions noticeably improved ( i.e. , for the same number of particles ) .",

    "2(a)-(c ) we also compare the exact and tfa of @xmath56 , but now with the _ relative coordinate _ fixed to @xmath57 and the center - of - mass coordinate allowed to vary .",
    "note that fixing @xmath58 yields the zero temperature single - particle density , which has already been investigated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "while the overall spatial behaviour of the two expressions are in agreement , the tfa clearly does not reproduce the fine spatial oscillations in the exact expression , which are associated with shell - filling effects .",
    "the reason for this , of course , is due to the fact that the lda fails to take into account the discrete nature of the energy level structure of the trap .",
    "we will come back to this point in the sec .",
    "iv c below .",
    "nevertheless , by @xmath59 , the agreement between the exact and tf expression is quite good , except near the classical turning point , where the tf curves drop abruptly to zero . while it is possible to show analytically the reduction of the zero temperature particle and kinetic energy densities to their tf forms , e.g. , @xmath60",
    "@xcite , we have not yet been able to analytically establish a similar result for @xmath61 .",
    "the demonstration of this result is an interesting problem in its own right .",
    "as a simple application of our results , we now consider the evaluation of an exact closed form expression for the hf exchange energy suitable for the study of 2d parabolically confined quantum dots . here",

    "@xcite , we showed analytically the surprising result that the 2d tf functional for the kinetic - energy density ( i.e. , without gradient corrections ) , when integrated over all space , leads to the _ exact _ quantum mechanical kinetic energy .",
    "moreover , we also demonstrated numerically that if the exact single - particle density is inserted into the 2d tf kinetic - energy functional , even the local shell oscillations are reproduced remarkably well @xcite .",
    "thus , the unique local and global properties of the trapped 2d system are reason enough for us to focus on two - dimensions .",

    "thus , although shell oscillations can be included in the tfa of @xmath76 ( i.e. , by using the exact density ) , it is important to note that for a given @xmath73 , the weighting given to the laguerre polynomials in @xmath77^{3/2}$ ] _ is not _ the same as the weight assigned to the laguerre polynomials in eq .",
    "consequently , the exchange energy densities do not agree as we vary the center - of - mass coordinate",
    ". we note in particular that the shell - effects in tfa are less pronounced than the exact result , and by @xmath59 and @xmath78 , are essentially washed out [ see fig .",
    "it is also worth recounting here , that by @xmath79 ( see fig .  3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the deviations between the exact and tf 2d kinetic energy densities are essentially nonexistent ; this is clearly not the case for the exchange energy density .",
    "the reasons behind the success of the tfa for the kinetic energy density are thoughoroughly discussed in ref .",
    "nevertheless , the numerics clearly indicate here that as @xmath4 , @xmath80 .    while the local behaviour of the exact and tf exchange energy densities are not well reproduced ( as opposed to the comparatively superb agreement between the exact and tf kinetic energy densities )",
    ", the exchange energy itself agrees remarkable well . to illustrate this , we show in table i the exact and tf exchange energies for various numbers of filled shells .",
    "the largest relative percentage error , which occurs at @xmath81 , is only @xmath82 .",
    "thus , when _",
    "global _ quantities are considered , the lda is an excellent approximation for the inhomogeneous 2d exchange energy , even for @xmath83 .",
    ".comparison of the zero temperature exchange energy for the exact [ eq .  ( 40 ) ] and tf [ eq .  ( 46 ) ] expressions for various numbers of filled shells .",
    "the last column displays the relative percentage error in the two quantities . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the main result of this paper can be summarized by eq .",
    "( 22 ) , which defines the exact , @xmath2-dimensional , finite temperature first - order density matrix of an ideal gas of harmonically confined fermions .",
    "this expression should prove to be of interest in the general area of the dft of inhomogeneous fermi systems at both zero and finite temperatures . in this paper , we have used it to illustrate that ( in 2d ) the lda is an excellent approximation for the the off - diagonal first - order density matrix in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "we have also obtained a simple , closed form expression for the finite temperature exchange energy density for a 2d parabolically confined quantum dot . in the spirit of our previous work  @xcite , we have utilized this exact expression to test the validity of the lda for the exchange energy density .",
    "in contrast to our earlier findings  @xcite , the 2d tf exchange energy functional _ does not _ reproduce the shell effects of the exact result very well . nevertheless , when the tf exchange energy density is integrated over all space , we find that the resulting exchange energy is always within @xmath84 of the exact result .",
    "we wish to point out that the utility of our results are not limited to the topics discussed in this paper .",
    "the simple , analytical expressions that we have provided will be very useful in the obtaining other closed form expressions of interest to both theorists working in formal dft , and experimentalists studying e.g. , ultra - cold trapped fermions .",
    "one example that comes to mind is the 2d weakly interacting trapped fermi gas . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the use of a contact psuedopotential ( in 2d ) led to the surprising discovery that there is _ no splitting _ between states with different angular momentum values @xmath26 in a given shell at @xmath36 .",
    "this occurs in spite of the fact that the perturbation interaction does not preserve the @xmath85 symmetry of the system .",
    "whether this result still holds true for a finite - range psuedopotential is an interesting question , which can be addressed using our analytical expression for @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the close connection between trapped fermi gases and the theory of nuclear structure suggests that our findings will be relavent in the area of nuclear physics ( e.g. , in the fermi gas model of the nucleus )",
    ". finally , our work here should also be useful in the physics of metal clusters , which represent an intermediate stage in the transition from small molecules to bulk solids or liquids .",
