    "a wide range of scientific and engineering problems involve multiscale phenomena . roughly speaking ,",
    "each matter is characterized by its own geometric dimensions which are very often several order of magnitude larger .",
    "the study and the understanding of these issues demand the development of new mathematical tools and methods .",
    "homogenization theory is such a tool which now occupies a central place in contemporary mathematical research .",
    "deterministic problems in the periodic setting prominently featured in the first decade of the development of the theory till the pioneering works of kozlov @xcite , papanicolaou and varadhan @xcite in stochastic homogenization in the late 1970s .",
    "since then intense research activities have been undertaken with a great wealth of results as shown by the vast existing literature to date , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting the interesting work on stochastic homogenization in the framework of viscosity solutions by several prominent mathematicians @xcite .",
    "in order to deal with deterministic homogenization theory beyond the periodic setting , nguetseng @xcite , following zhikov and krivenko zhikov4 , introduced the concept of homogenization algebras .",
    "this theory relies heavily on ergodic theory ( but not the ergodicity ! ) because in applications , the assumption of ergodicity of the homogenization algebra considered is fundamental .",
    "_  it is important to note that there was a gap between the periodic homogenization theory and the stochastic homogenization theory , gap which was filled by nguetseng s deterministic homogenization theory .",
    "however as we will see in the present work , this recent deterministic theory can be viewed as a special case of a generalized version of the stochastic homogenization theory of bourgeat et al .",
    "@xcite which we construct .",
    "_ indeed , theorem [ t2.2 ] ( see section 2 ) allows to build on the spectrum of an algebra with mean value , a dynamical system whose invariant measure is precisely the measure related to the mean value defined on the algebra . as a result of the above - mentioned theorem , we get a generalization of all the results presented in @xcite , those in 26 , cmp being the special case corresponding to ergodic algebras ; see section 4 .",
    "the two theories mentioned above have the specificity to be used to solve either stochastic homogenization problems only ( for the first one ) or deterministic homogenization problems only ( for the second one ) .",
    "unfortunately , as we know , in nature , very few phenomena behave , either just randomly or deterministically ; most of these phenomena behave randomly in some scales , and deterministically in other scales .    motivated by this vision of the physical nature , we rely on these two theories and hence on their associated convergence methods ( the stochastic two scale convergence in the mean @xcite and the @xmath0-convergence @xcite ) to propose a general method of solving coupled - deterministic and stochastic - homogenization problems .",
    "our method , the _",
    "@xmath0__-convergence _ _ , combines the macroscopic and microscopic [ random and deterministic ] scales , and has therefore the advantage of taking both the simplicity and the efficiency of the macroscopic models , as well as the accuracy of the coupled random - deterministic microscopic models .",
    "moreover our multiscale approach is motivated by the fact that the usual monoscale approach has proven to be inadequate because of prohibitively large number of variables involved in each physical problem .",
    "one can also give at least two reasons quite natural .",
    "firstly , a scale can not be at the same time deterministic and random .",
    "secondly , the application of our results to natural phenomena ; see sections 5 and 6 . to be more precise",
    ", our method permits henceforth to treat deterministic homogenization problems without resorting to the ergodicity assumption on one hand , and on the other hand allow viewing the stochastic two - scale convergence in the mean @xcite in a more general angle as generalizing the @xmath0-convergence @xcite .",
    "we hope that the theory developed in the present paper will find applications in the emerging field of homogenization of stochastic partial differential equations undertaken in the papers @xcite ,  wang in the periodic case and in @xcite in the case of non periodically perforated domains .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give some preliminary results related to the theory of dynamical systems on abstract probability spaces .",
    "we also define and give some fundamental properties of generalized besicovitch spaces .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the study of the concept of stochastic @xmath0-convergence .",
    "we prove therein some compactness results . in sections 4 , 5 and 6 ,",
    "we give several applications of the earlier results .",
    "we begin in section 4 by showing how the results of section 3 apply and how they generalize the existing results ; this is illustrated by the study of a rather simple linear operator in divergence form .",
    "we then compare our results with the already existing ones . in section 5",
    "we study the homogenization problem for the well - known nonlinear reynolds equation .",
    "one important achievement of our results is obtained in section 6 where we solve the coupled stochastic - deterministic homogenization problem related to the following stokes equation : @xmath1we get the following homogenization result which is , to our knowledge , new",
