    "it is also interesting to observe the si(222 ) diffraction peak . for a bulk si ,",
    "the ( 222 ) peak is forbidden by the diamond crystal structure .",

    "the finite width of the superconducting transitions introduces an ambiguity into the definition of the critical field and critical temperature .",
    "typically one defines the transition by its midpoint , but other criteria can also be used .",
    "for instance , one can define the transition as the temperature or field at which the resistance reaches 10% of its normal state value or 90% ( onset ) of its normal state value or when the resistance falls to zero .",
    "of course , there is always a concern that the phase diagram depends on which definition of the critical field was used . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , using a 50% or 10% criterion for @xmath31 does not alter the overall structure of the phase diagrams in this study .",

    "the thermodynamic and transport properties of thin superconducting films in the presence of a high parallel magnetic field are influenced by various material parameters .",
    "these include the film thickness @xmath12 , which determines the relative importance of zeeman splitting and the orbital effects of the magnetic field , the spin - orbit scattering time @xmath35 , and fermi - liquid effects that renormalize the spin susceptibility . for low-@xmath15 superconducting films ,",
    "a quasiclassical generalization of bcs theory ( qcst ) incorporating these effects was developed in ref .  ; for numerical calculations , we find the reformulation presented in ref .",
    "easier to implement .",
    "the three dimensionless parameters capturing the effects mentioned above are the antisymmetric fermi - liquid parameter @xmath33 , the spin - orbit parameter @xmath61 ( with @xmath4 the zero - temperature gap ) , and the orbital pair - breaking parameter @xmath43 [ ] : @xmath62 with @xmath37 the diffusion coefficient , @xmath63 the electron charge , @xmath64 the bohr magneton , and @xmath65 the mean free path .",
    "this expression is valid for any ratio of mean free path to thickness , with the function @xmath66 defined as @xmath67\\ ] ]    given the above parameters , the task is to solve the so - called usadel equations for the semiclassical green s functions , together with the self - consistent equations for the order parameter @xmath68 and the internal magnetic field @xmath69 ; the latter takes into account the fermi - liquid renormalization of the spin susceptibility , which in the normal state leads to @xmath70 with @xmath71 the applied field . for the calculation of the supercooling field and of the critical field above the tricritical temperature  fields",
    "at which the order parameter vanishes and which we denote with @xmath16 ,  the solution of these equations can be found in analytical form , and an equation determining @xmath16 as a function of temperature @xmath72 can be obtained ; see refs .  .",
    "this equation is then easily solved numerically .",
    "in contrast , the calculation of the superheating field @xmath73 requires a fully numerical solution of the usadel and self - consistent equations . to find @xmath73 we exploit the fact that for fields between @xmath16 and @xmath73 the self - consistent equation for the order parameter has two solutions , one stable and the other unstable . at the superheating field these two solutions collapse , implying that the derivative of the self - consistent equation with respect of the order parameter vanishes at that field ; therefore , imposing this additional condition makes it possible to uniquely determine @xmath73 .    to compare theory and experiment ,",
    "we proceed as follows : for the thickest film , we find a good fit to the experimental data by fixing the spin - orbit parameter @xmath74 to be similar to previously measured values and letting @xmath43 and @xmath33 vary freely .",
    "this approach gives the best fit to the low - temperature data , but can not be applied to the thinner films which display hysteresis .",
    "for these films , we find the parameters that best agree with the experimental data subject to the following constraints : the orbital pair - breaking parameter @xmath43 should decrease with decreasing thickness ; the calculated tricritical point should be as close as possible to the measured one , while at the same time the calculated superheating curve should always give fields higher than the measured @xmath73 , and the calculated supercooling curve should always be below the measured supercooling fields .",
    "this accounts for the fact that the calculated curves represent limits of stability for metastable states , so phase transitions should take place between these limits but not outside them .    in order to more fully explore the fitting parameter space we also performed fits in which we only used the data points below the tricitical point .",
    "this optimization strategy places a much larger emphasis on the magnitude of the hysteresis . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , with this fitting strategy the theory accurately predicts the superheating branch and the overall hysteresis width , but it crosses a portion of the supercooling branch ( see green arrows ) and badly underestimates the higher temperature , @xmath75-order , critical fields ( see orange arrows ) . since the theory traces represent the limits of metastability , it is unphysical for any portion of the supercooling branch to lie below the theory trace",
    ". furthermore the values of the fitting parameters obtained with this optimization scheme are not in good agreement with values obtained from previous studies .",
    "the values of @xmath33 are a factor of 2 - 10 too small , and the spin - orbit parameter is a factor of 2 too large .",
    "this analysis suggests that the discrepancy between theory and data can not be resolved by a more judicial choice of fitting parameters .",
    "phase diagrams for the 12 ml and 17 ml films along with the corresponding fits .",
    "the fits were obtained using only the data points below the tricritical point .",

    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is the spin - orbit scattering parameter , as obtained from the phase diagram fits , as a function of film thickness .",
    "note that @xmath42 appears to vary linearly with thickness .",
    "these data can be compared with those obtained by coating low atomic mass superconducting film with high atomic mass nobel metals .      specifically , as reported in ref .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling parameter in superconducting be films of varying thickness was measured before and after coating the films with 0.5 nm layer of au .",
    "the au layer induced a large spin - orbit scattering rate in the superconductor , which completely suppressed the tricritical point and corresponding hysteresis in the critical field transition .",
    "in addition , the induced spin - orbit scattering greatly increased the parallel critical field of the films .",
    "in contrast to our observations , the spin - orbit scattering parameter in the be / au bilayers varied as @xmath76 . this discrepancy may be due to the fact that the epitaxial al films are in the limit of @xmath77 but , the be / au system was in the strong spin - orbit limit @xmath78 .",

    "<S> we report the evolution of the zeeman - mediated superconducting phase diagram ( pd ) in ultra - thin crystalline al films . </S>",

    "<S> this subject has had a long history , but nevertheless , remains at the forefront of condensed matter and atomic physics . in condensed matter one of the most intensely studied examples </S>",
    "<S> is that of spin - singlet superconductors subjected to zeeman and/or exchange fields . in the 1960 s </S>",
    "<S> it was proposed that a zeeman field could induce a spatially modulated order parameter in a spin singlet superconductor , known as the ferrel - fulde - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state @xcite . over the last decade </S>",
    "<S> substantial thermodynamic evidence for its existence has emerged from studies of ultra - low impurity bulk superconductors such as the heavy fermion inter - metallic cecoin@xmath1 @xcite and the layered organic superconductors @xcite . for spintronics applications , </S>",
    "<S> the focus is on the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , spin imbalance can be created in a superconductor by injecting spin - polarized currents from a ferromagnetic metal @xcite , or a ferromagnetic insulator can induce in the superconductor a large exchange field which can then be modulated by an applied magnetic field @xcite . in cold atomic gases , </S>",
    "<S> an analog of fflo has been proposed @xcite whose behavior is affected by the effective dimensionality of the system . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we map out , as a function of temperature and film thickness , the zeeman - limited superconducting phase diagram of crystalline al films , which are effectively two - dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagrams of films thinner than 20 monolayers have a structure that markedly differs from that expected for a homogeneous ground state . </S>",
    "<S> our data add further evidence that these otherwise classical bcs superconductors evolve a non - trivial order parameter , that is neither homogeneous nor fflo , when the zeeman energy approaches the superconducting gap energy .    </S>",

    "<S> in addition to the finite width of the critical field transitions , the analysis is complicated by the fact that , in the hysteretic region , the films are in a metastable state and therefore exhibit some temporal relaxation . because of this the width of the hysteresis loops is a weak function of the magnetic field sweep rate . </S>",

    "<S> the superconducting properties of thin films in the presence of high zeeman field are influenced by ( 1 ) fermi - liquid effects which renormalize the spin susceptibility , ( 2 ) spin - orbit scattering which inhibits spin polarization , and ( 3 ) sample thickness , which determines the relative importance of the orbital response to the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the quasi - classical theory of weak coupling superconductivity @xcite ( qcts ) , as applied to the zeeman - limited superconductivity @xcite , captures these effects via the corresponding dimensionless parameters @xcite : the anti - symmetric fermi - liquid @xmath33 , the spin - orbit @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the spin - orbit scattering time , and the orbital pair - breaking @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the electron diffusivity and @xmath12 is the film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 is a measure of the renormalization of the spin susceptibility of an interacting fermi gas . </S>",
    "<S> it is related to the ratio of the spin susceptibility density of states @xmath38 to the specific heat density of states @xcite @xmath39 by @xmath40 .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig4 ] where obtained by varying @xmath33 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 in order to get the best correspondence to the measured phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> details of this procedure are provided in the appendix  [ app : theory ] . following the evolution of the pd s in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] from the thickest films to the thinnest , we first note that the critical field transition in the 30 ml sample remains 2@xmath44-order down to the lowest temperatures measured ( @xmath45 mk ) . </S>",
    "<S> also note that there is an excellent agreement between theory and the measured phase boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the extracted values of @xmath33 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are consistent with results from studies of relatively thick qc al films @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the spin - orbit parameter @xmath42 increases with decreasing thickness , see appendix  [ app : so ] . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that a small but measurable spin - orbit scattering rate is associated with the si - al interface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , as the film thickness is lowered the interface contribution to @xmath42 becomes more significant .    </S>",
    "<S> the antisymmetric fermi liquid parameter , @xmath33 , which accounts for the spin - triplet interaction channel , also increases with decreasing film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this thickness dependence is unknown , but @xmath33 does appear to track the thickness dependence of @xmath15 , see inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the underlying mechanism that gives rise to the enhancement of the spin - singlet interaction channel , which is reflected in @xmath15 also affects the spin - triplet channel and , consequently , the normal state spin susceptibility .    as can be seen in the 27 ml panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , decreasing the thickness by only 3 ml reduces the orbital depairing rate enough to open a 1@xmath30-order transition below a tricritical point @xmath46 mk . both the tricritical point and the temperature dependence of the hysteresis width @xmath47 are well accounted for by the theory . </S>",
    "<S> but as the film thickness is decreased further , the measured pd s begin to deviate more and more from the theoretical curves . </S>",
    "<S> although qcts can account for @xmath48 across the entire range of thicknesses , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] , the measured hysteresis magnitudes are much smaller than expected in the thinner samples . </S>",
    "<S> even more striking , the slopes of the down - sweep branches of the 12 and 7 ml pd s are either flat or slightly negative whereas the slopes of the theory traces are robustly positive . </S>",
    "<S> since the down - sweep critical fields represent the transition from the normal state to the superconducting state , the data in the 12 ml and 17 ml panels indicate that the superconducting phase nucleates well before theory would predict . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is somewhat counterintuitive . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests that the non - equilibrium normal state is more fragile than the corresponding superconducting state .    </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is that the metastable normal state is simply more susceptible to environmental fluctuations than the superconducting phase which prevents the system from reaching the theoretical supercooling phase boundary . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is that quantum fluctuations about an intermediate inhomogeneous phase compromise the free energy barrier associated with the 1@xmath30-order transition to the superconducting phase . indeed , the relative asymmetry of the superheating and supercooling phase boundaries , as compared to the corresponding theory traces , is reminiscent of the asymmetric avalanche behavior observed near the zeeman critical field of qc al films @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . specifically , highly disordered qc al films often exhibit avalanche - like jumps in the superheating branch of the hysteresis loop but only very rarely are avalanches observed on the supercooling branch . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of supercooling avalanches is consistent with the fact that the supercooling branches of the 7 , 12 , and 17 ml al films never approach the theoretical limit of metastability .    </S>",
    "<S> it is somewhat surprising that the qcst description of the zeeman - limited pd breaks down in the regime where the orbital pair - breaking contributions are completely negligible . </S>",
    "<S> if the films were , in fact , free of disorder , this is precisely the regime where one would expect the fflo phase to emerge . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , recent hubbard model calculations have shown that near the zeeman critical field a vestige of an fflo - like phase is stabilized by a finite impurity density @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this disordered - lo phase is associate with local modulations of the pairing amplitude which , of course , should exhibit some manifestation in the structure of the pd . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that this inhomogeneous phase is preempting the expected supercooling critical field . </S>",
    "<S> extending the present work to include spin - resolved tunneling probes of the zeeman - limited condensate may help confirm this possibility .    </S>",
