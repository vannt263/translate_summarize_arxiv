    "1994 , chepurnov & lazarian 2009 , crutcher 2012 ) .",
    "the existing star formation paradigm has been developed with the concept that flux freezing holds , i.e. that the magnetic field is well coupled with ions and electrons in the media ( alfvn 1942 ) .",
    "therefore it has been assumed assumed that the way to move matter across magnetic field lines should involve ambipolar diffusion ( see mestel 1965 , 1966 , mouschovias et al .",
    "according to the theory , the change of the flux to mass ratio happens due to _ ambipolar diffusion _ ,",
    "i.e. to the drift of neutrals which do not feel magnetic fields directly , but only through ion - neutral collisions .",
    "naturally , in the presence of gravity , neutrals get concentrated towards the center of the gravitational potential while magnetic fields resist compression and therefore leave the forming protostar .",
    "the rate of ambipolar diffusion for a cloud in gravitational equilibrium with the magnetic field depends only on the degree of ionization of the media .",
    "magnetic fields are important at all stages of star formation . in many instances",
    "the ideas of star formation based exclusively on ambipolar diffusion have been challenged by observations ( troland & heiles 1986 , shu et al .",
    "2006 , crutcher et al .",
    "2009 , 2010a , see crutcher 2012 for a review ) .    while astrophysical fluids show a wide variety of properties in terms of their collisionality , degree of ionization , temperature etc . , they share a common property , namely , most of the fluids are turbulent .",
    "the turbulent state of the fluids arises from large reynolds numbers @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the scale of the flow , @xmath2 is it velocity and @xmath3 is the viscosity , associated with astrophysical media .",
    "note , that the large magnitude of @xmath4 is mostly the consequence of the large astrophysical scales @xmath1 involved as well as the fact that ( the field - perpendicular ) viscosity is constrained by the presence of magnetic field .",
    "the key concept of magnetic flux freezing has been challenged recently . on the basis of the model of fast magnetic reconnection in lazarian & vishniac ( 1999 , henceforth lv99 ) , lazarian ( 2005 )",
    "claimed that the removal of magnetic fields from turbulent plasma can happen during star formation due to magnetic reconnection rather than slow ambipolar drift ( see also lazarian & vishniac 2009 ) .",
    "the process that was later termed _ reconnection diffusion _ does not depend on the degree of ionization , but rather on the properties of turbulence .",
    "the numerical confirmation of the idea was presented for molecular clouds and circumstellar accretion disks in santos - lima et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "the numerical testing of the lv99 reconnection model that underpins the concept of reconnection diffusion was successfully tested in kowal ( 2009 , 2012 ) .",
    "compared to this testing of reconnection diffusion , the testing in kowal et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2012 ) was performed with much higher numerical resolution of the reconnection region and much better control of turbulence and other input parameters .",
    "in addition , more recent formal mathematical studies aimed at understanding of magnetic field dynamics in turbulent fluids supported the lv99 predictions ( see eyink , lazarian & vishniac 2011 ) .",
    "we note that the interstellar medium is collisional ( yamada et al .",
    "2006 ) , and therefore ideas of collisionless reconnection ( see shay & drake 1998 , shay et al .",
    "1998 , bhattacharjee et al .",
    "2005 , cassak et al .",
    "2006 ) are not applicable . in addition , a theory of magnetic reconnection is necessary to understand whether reconnection is represented correctly in numerical simulations .",
    "one should keep in mind that reconnection is fast in computer simulations due to high numerical diffusivity . therefore ,",
    "if there are situations where magnetic fields reconnect slowly , numerical simulations do not adequately reproduce the astrophysical reality .",
    "this means that if collisionless reconnection is indeed the only way to make reconnection fast , then the numerical simulations of many astrophysical processes , including those in interstellar media , which is collisional at the relevant scales , are in error .    to understand the difference between reconnection in astrophysical situations and in numerical simulations",
    ", one should recall that the dimensionless combination that controls the resistive reconnection rate is the lundquist number as a characteristic speed instead of the alfvn speed @xmath5 , which is taken in the lundquist number .",
    "] , defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the length of the reconnection layer , @xmath5 is the alfvn velocity , and @xmath8 is ohmic diffusivity . because of the large astrophysical length - scales @xmath7 involved , the lundquist numbers are huge in astrophysics , e.g. for the ism they are about @xmath9 , while present - day mhd simulations correspond to @xmath10 . as the numerical efforts scale as @xmath11 , where @xmath7 is the size of the box , it is feasible neither at present nor in the foreseeable future to have simulations with realistically lundquist numbers .",
    "as the brute approach fails , it is important to understand if and when numerical correctly represent astrophysical reality in spite of the tremendous difference in lundquist numbers .",
    "if magnetic fields can not reconnect fast , the intersection magnetic filed lines should create 3d elastic structure making magnetized fluid jello - like .",
    "this would automatically mean that numerical simulations of magnetized fluids can not represent astrophysical phenomena which lundquist numbers are much larger than those of the simulations . to understand whether fluid - like behavior is possible",
    "we should consider the process of magnetic reconnection .",
    "is limited by resistivity and is small . _",
    "lower panel _ : reconnection according to the lv99 model .",
    "@xmath12 is determined by turbulent field wandering and can be large . from lazarian , vishniac & cho ( 2004 ) . ]",
    "the corresponding study of 3d magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence was performed in lv99 . according to the latter study , magnetic reconnection of a turbulent field is _ fast _ , i.e. independent of resistivity and it happens at a rate @xmath13 where @xmath7 is the horizontal extent of the reconnection zone ( see figure [ lv ] ) , @xmath1 is the injection scale of turbulence , @xmath5 is the alfvn velocity and @xmath14 is the magnetic mach number . in eq .",
    "( [ lv99 ] ) it is assumed that turbulence is subalfvnic . for @xmath15 , lv99 got the expression that differs from eq .",
    "( [ lv99 ] ) by a change of the power @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "the lv99 model of magnetic reconnection generalized the classical sweet - parker model of reconnection ( see upper plot in figure [ lv ] ) for the case of turbulent fields .",
    "the enhancement of the reconnection rate compared to the sweet - parker model is achieved by increasing the outflow region @xmath12 by accounting for magnetic field wandering .",
    "indeed , in the sweet - parker model the reconnection speed is limited by the outflow of the matter from the reconnection layer and @xmath12 is determined by ohmic diffusion .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 is much less than @xmath5 since @xmath19 . at the same time @xmath12 becomes comparable with @xmath1 for @xmath20 provided that @xmath12 is determined by the turbulent field wandering",
    "at the scales less that the scale of injection of the strong mhd turbulence , i.e. for @xmath21 ( lv99 , lazarian 2006 ) : @xmath22 the magnetic field lines exhibit accelerated diffusion . indeed , the separation between two particles @xmath23 for kolmogorov turbulence is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is proportional to a cube - root of the energy cascading rate , i.e. @xmath26 for turbulence injected with superalvenic velocity @xmath27 at the scale @xmath1 .",
    "the solution of this equation is @xmath28^{3/2 } , \\label{sol}\\ ] ] which provides richardson diffusion or @xmath29 .",
    "the accelerating character of the process is easy to understand physically . indeed , the larger the separation between the particles , the faster the eddies that carry the particles apart .",
    "eyink , lazarian & vishniac ( 2011 ) showed that the presence of richardson diffusion induces fast magnetic reconnection and re - derived expressions for the reconnection rate from the richarson diffusion concept .",
    "this provides a way to understand the applicability of lv99 approach to more involved cases , e.g. for the case of fluid with viscosity much larger than magnetic diffusivity , i.e. the high prandtl number fluids .",
    "a partially ionized gas is an example of such a fluids , which is essential to understand in terms of star formation .    in high prandtl number media the gs95-type turbulent motions decay at the scale @xmath30 , which is much larger than the scale of at which ohmic dissipation gets important .",
    "thus over a range of scales less than @xmath30 magnetic fields preserve their identity and are being affected by the shear on the scale @xmath30 .",
    "this is the regime of turbulence described in cho , lazarian & vishniac ( 2002 ) and lazarian , vishniac & cho ( 2004 ) . in view of the findings in eyink",
    "( 2011 ) to establish when magnetic reconnection is fast and obeys the lv99 predictions one should establish the range of scales at which magnetic fields obey richardson diffusion . it is easy to see that the transition to the richardson diffusion happens when field lines get separated by the perpendicular scale of the critically damped eddies @xmath30 .",
    "the separation in the perpendicular direction starts with the scale @xmath31 follows the lyapunov exponential growth with the distance @xmath32 measured along the magnetic field lines , i.e. @xmath33 , where @xmath34 corresponds to critically damped eddies with @xmath35 .",
    "it seems natural to associate @xmath31 with the separation of the field lines arising from ohmic resistivity on the scale of the critically damped eddies @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ohmic resistivity coefficient .    in this formulation",
    "the problem of magnetic line separation is similar to the anisotropic analog of the rechester & rosenbluth ( 1978 ) problem ( see narayan & medvedev 2003 , lazarian 2006 ) and therefore distance to be covered along magnetic field lines before the lines separate by the distance larger than the perpendicular scale of viscously damped eddies is equal to @xmath38 taking into account eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) and that @xmath39 where @xmath3 is the viscosity coefficient .",
    "( [ rr ] ) can be rewritten @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the prandtl number . .",
    "if the current sheets are much longer than @xmath42 , then magnetic field lines undergo richardson diffusion and according to eyink et al .",
    "( 2011 ) the reconnection follows the laws established in lv99 . in other words , on scales significantly larger than the viscous damping scale lv99 reconnection is applicable . at the same time on scales",
    "less than @xmath43 magnetic reconnection may be slow .",
    "somewhat more complex arguments were employed in lazarian et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to prove that the reconnection is fast in the partially ionized gas . for our further discussion",
    "it is important that lv99 model is applicable both to fully ionized and partially ionized plasmas .",
    "the rate given by eq .",
    "( [ lv99 ] ) is sufficient to allow the magnetic field to disentangle during the turnover of the eddies .",
    "such eddies are a part of the picture of strong alfvnic turbulence ( see goldreich & sridhar 1995 , henceforth gs95 ) . as a result , mixing eddy - type motions are possible in high lundquist number fluids .",
    "the peculiarity of reconnection diffusion is that it requires nearly parallel magnetic field lines to reconnect , while the textbook description of reconnection frequently deals with anti - parallel description of magnetic field lines .",
    "one should understand that the situation shown in figure [ lv ] is just a cross section of the magnetic fluxes depicting the anti - parallel components of magnetic field .",
    "generically , in 3d reconnection configurations the sheared component of magnetic field is present .",
    "this component is also frequently referred to as `` guide field '' in the reconnection literature .    as we discuss below reconnection diffusion",
    "is closely connected with the reconnection between adjacent alfvnic eddies ( see figure [ mix ] ) . as a result",
    ", adjacent flux tubes exchange their segments with entrained plasmas and flux tubes of different eddies get connected .",
    "this process involves eddies of all the sizes along the cascade and ensures fast diffusion which has similarities with turbulent diffusion in ordinary hydrodynamic flows .",
    "ions and neutrals closely follows laminar magnetic field lines .",
    "turbulent reconnection requires that magnetic flux gets leaky and plasma move perpendicular to the mean magnetic field . in this situation the mass loading on magnetic field lines changes and the mass to flux ratio does not stay constant .    in the absence of gravity reconnection diffusion would tend to distribute magnetic flux and volume uniformly in the volume .",
    "therefore any initial correlation of density and magnetic fields should dissipate due to reconnection diffusion .    in the presence of gravity one should expect density to diffuse towards the gravitating center , while leaving magnetic field behind .",
    "this would happen even in purely ionized plasmas , as reconnection diffusion does not depend on the degree of ionization .",
    "plasma motions along magnetic field lines is expected to be diffusive due to magnetic field wandering .",
    "therefore the concepts of collection of matter along magnetic field lines must be modified in the presence of turbulence .",
    "numerical testing of reconnection diffusion concept have been performed in a series of papers by santos - lima et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "both diffusion in the absence and in the presence of gravitational potential was tested .",
    "the results corresponded well to the theoretical expectations .",
    "in particular , in santos - lima et al .",
    "( 2012 ) the study of the formation of circumstellar accretion disks has been performed . in the absence of turbulence the disks did not form , demonstrating the well - known magnetic breaking catastrophe behavior .",
    "indeed , ambient interstellar magnetic field were getting stronger during the phase of accretion and were very efficient in removing angular momentum .",
    "reconnection diffusion , however , was removing magnetic fields from the turbulent accreting matter and was shown to be able to resolve the magnetic breaking paradox .",
    "this corresponded to the theoretical expectations in lazarian & vishniac ( 2009 ) .",
    "numerical modeling of molecular clouds in santos - lima et al .",
    "( 2010 ) demonstrated the ability of matter to concentrate towards the gravitational potential leaving magnetic field behind .",
    "the effect was shown to be present for different initial conditions .",
    "a comparison of the reconnection diffusion expectations with observations was performed in lazarian , esquivel & crutcher ( 2012 ) . in particular ,",
    "results of crutcher ( 2010 ) on the difference of the magnetization of cores and evelopes was analyzed .",
    "the traditional ambipolar diffusion requires that the less ionized and therefore more diffusive core should lose magnetic field faster than the envelope that has larger degree of ioniziation .",
    "there a larger mass to flux ratio is expected in the core compared to the envelope .",
    "contrary to the above expectations the observations indicated that the mass to flux ratio is larger in the envelope than in the core .",
    "this can not be explained with ambipolar diffusion . at the same time",
    ", reconnection diffusion presents us with a number of possibilities . as the reconnection diffusion does not depend on the degree of ionization this removes the constraint that the magnetic field diffusion should happen faster out of the core .",
    "for instance , in a model of a homogeneous molecular cloud boadering with the diffuse media with lower magnetization , the central part of the cloud keeps larger magnetization than its periphery . in the case of the core and the envelope system , the core with the lower level of turbulence and larger magnetic field may be subalfenic , i.e. have the alfven mach number @xmath44 and exhibit the reconnection diffusion that is suppressed by the factor @xmath45 .",
    "due to this factor , reconnection diffusion has an interesting property , namely , the larger initial magnetization , the slower the diffusion .",
    "thus suggests that in the case of a collapse that compresses magnetic field the regions of higher magnetization will tend to lose magnetic flux slower , increasing the contrast between regions of low and high magnetization .",
    "this is provided that the regions have the same size . otherwise , for the same degree of magnetization smaller regions will tend to lose the excess of magnetic field quicker .",
    "indeed , the diffusion coefficient @xmath46 scales as @xmath47 , while the rate of diffusion scales as @xmath48 and therefore @xmath49 . in the presence of self - gravity , however , one expect the denser regions to decouple from the cascade and the turbulent relation to be modified . making cores substantially less turbulent than envelopes .",
    "all in all , while the decrease of the core size tends to make the diffusion out of the core faster , other effects , i.e. decrease of the turbulence in the core due to decoupling of the motions in the core from the outside cascade and smaller alfven mach number of the core tend to prolong the time of the diffusion of magnetic flux out from the core . due to the effects discussed above",
    ", the inhomogeneity of the envelope may also contribute to the higher mass to flux ratio observed in the envelope .",
    "an additional effect related to reconnection diffusion may be important for enhancing the mass to flux ratio in envelops compared to cores .",
    "if the matter is accumulated along magnetic field lines due to external forcing rather than self - gravity , the matter will not follow the hour glass morphology of the field , but due to field wandering should preferentially reside in the envelope .",
    "all these processes should be quantified better , but , it is clear that , unlike the process of ambipolar diffusion , reconnection diffusion allow situations that the cores are more magnetized than envelops .",
    "further research of the issue as well as more extensive comparison of the observational data with model predictions are required .",
    "lazarian , esquivel & crutcher ( 2012 ) compared the rates of reconnection diffusion of magnetic fields out of the cloud with the rate of gravitational collapse and calculated the critical densities at which clouds should collapse trapping the magnetic flux .",
    "the results of these calculations are encouraging .",
    "the column densities of the clouds at which the magnetic trapping happens were found to correspond to observations in crutcher ( 2012 ) .",
    "it is encouraging that the reconnection diffusion concept provides new ways of approaching challenging problems of star formation in extreme environments .",
    "for instance , galaxies emitting more than @xmath50 solar luminosities in the far - infrared are called ultra - luminous infrared galaxies or ulirgs .",
    "the physical conditions in such galaxies are extreme with a very high density of cosmic rays ( see papadopoulos et al .",
    "ambipolar diffusion is expected to be suppressed due to cosmic ray ionization .",
    "at the same time these environments have the highest star formation rates .",
    "this is suggestive of a process that removes magnetic fields independent of the level of ionization .",
    "reconnection diffusion does not depend on ionization and provides a natural explanation .",
    "it looks that reconnection diffusion can provide solutions to other long standing problems .",
    "for instance , the observed star formation rate is about the same in galaxies with low metallicities as in galaxies with high metallicities ( see elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) .",
    "this is difficult to understand if magnetic field loss is governed by ambipolar diffusion , that is supposed to be much faster in low-@xmath51 galaxies with high metallicities . as a result",
    ", ambipolar diffusion theory predicts that the initial mass function ( imf ) and therefore the star formation rate would be shifted in low-@xmath51 galaxies .",
    "this prediction contradicts to observations .",
    "as we discussed earlier , reconnection diffusion efficiency does not depend on metallicity , and this provides a solution consistent with observations .",
    "in addition , an important property of reconnection diffusion is that , unlike ambipolar diffusion , it not only provides the removal of the magnetic field , but also induces its turbulent mixing , which tends to make the distribution of magnetic field uniform .",
    "thus turbulent mixing mediated by reconnection diffusion helps to keep the diffuse media in a magnetized subcritical state .",
    "in this situation , the external pressure is important for initiating collapse , which well corresponds to the observations of numerous small dark clouds not forming stars in the inter - arm regions of galaxies ( elmegreen 2011 ) .",
    "finally , the reconnection diffusion concept implies that in realistic turbulent media there is no characteristic density for the collapse to be initiated .",
    "therefore any cloud with the appropriate virial parameter ( see mckee & zweibel 1992 ) can form stars . the difference between different clouds arises from the density controlling the timescale of the collapse and kinetic energy determined either by the level of steering by turbulence or thermal motions of particles .",
    "directly , the requirement of clouds to be molecular is not present for the reconnection diffusion to induce star formation .",
    "the only difference between molecular and atomic clouds is that the former have lower temperatures .",
    "reconnection diffusion is based on the numerically tested lv99 model of fast reconnection in turbulent media as well as more recent insights into the violation of the frozen - in condition in turbulent magnetized fluids ( see eyink et al .",
    "the direct 3d mhd simulations of the magnetic field diffusion in santos - lima et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2012 ) showed consistency with the theoretical expectations , but such simulations on their own can not be used to justify the concept of reconnection diffusion .",
    "the interpretation of the results requires the proper understanding of scaling of magnetic reconnection with the dimensionless combination called the lunquist number @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the extent of the relevant current sheet , @xmath37 is ohmic diffusivity .",
    "the lundquist numbers in molecular clouds and in the corresponding simulations differ by a factor larger than @xmath54 .",
    "in this situation one can establish the correspondence between the numerical simulations and astrophysical reality only if the reconnection does not depend on @xmath55 .",
    "the independence from @xmath55 of magnetic reconnection is the conclusion of lv99 model .",
    "this model has been tested in kowal et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2012 ) via a set of dedicated numerical simulations that confirmed the scaling predictions in lv99 .",
    "this work exemplifies the advantages of the synergy of scaling arguments with numerical simulations as opposed to the `` brute force numerical approach '' , which may not be productive while dealing with turbulence .",
    "one can argue that the process of reconnection diffusion was present in some of high resolution numerical simulations , although the researchers did not identify the process .",
    "however , without clear identification of the role of turbulence in fast reconnection , one may not be sure when the results are due to physically motivated reconnection diffusion and when they are the consequence of the bogus effects of numerical diffusion .",
    "for instance , crutcher , hakobian & troland ( 2009 ) refer to the simulations in luntilla et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that produce , in agreement with observations , higher magnetization of the cloud cores .",
    "if these cores are of the size of several grid units across , numerical effects rather than reconnection diffusion may be dominant and turbulence is suppressed at these scales .",
    "there are some very good news for numerical simulations , however .",
    "the lv99 model predicts that the reconnection rates in turbulent fluids are independent of the local physics , but are determined by the turbulent motions . therefore parasitic numerical effects that induce poorly controlled small scale diffusivity of magnetic field lines are not important on the scales of turbulent motions . in other words ,",
    "the low resolution numerics may provide an adequate representation of high lundquist number astrophysical turbulence as far as the reconnection diffusion is concerned .    on the contrary ,",
    "if the structures studied in numerical simulations ( e.g. cores , filaments , shells ) lose turbulence due to numerical diffusivity effects , we predict that the diffusion of magnetic flux in those simulated structures differs significantly from the diffusion in the actual interstellar structures where turbulence persists . as a result ,",
    "naive convergence studies based on increasing the numerical resolution several times can not notice the problem unless the resolution increased to the degree that the aforementioned structures become turbulent .",
    "a number of studies attempted to understand the role of joint action of turbulence and ambipolar diffusion .",
    "for instance , heitsch et al . ( 2004 , henceforth hx04 ) performed 2.5d simulations of turbulence with two - fluid code and examined the decorrelation of neutrals and magnetic field in the presence of turbulence .",
    "the study reported an enhancement of diffusion rate compared to the ambipolar diffusion in a laminar fluid .",
    "hx04 correctly associated the enhancement with turbulence creating density gradients that are being dissolved by ambipolar diffusion ( see also zweibel 2002 ) .",
    "however , in 2.5d simulations of hx04 the numerical set - up artificially precluded reconnection from taking place as magnetic field was perpendicular to the plane of 2d mixing and therefore magnetic field lines were absolutely parallel to each other .",
    "this will not happen in any realistic astrophysical situation where reconnection will be an essential part of the physical picture .",
    "therefore we claim that a treatment of `` turbulent ambipolar diffusion '' without addressing the reconnection issue is of academic interest .    incidentally , the authors of hx04 reported an enhanced rate that is equal to the turbulent diffusion rate @xmath56 , which is the result expected within the reconnection diffusion picture for the special set - up studied .",
    "the fact that ambipolar diffusion rate does not enter the result in hx04 suggests that ambipolar diffusion is irrelevant for the diffusion of matter in the presence of turbulence .",
    "this is another reason not to call the observed process `` turbulent ambipolar diffusion '' .",
    "therefore we believe that hx04 captured in their simulations a special degenerate case of 2.5d turbulent diffusion where due to a special set up the reconnection is avoided and magnetic field lines do not intersect .",
    "we also note that , in the presence of turbulence , the independence of the gravitational collapse from the ambipolar diffusion rate was reported in numerical simulations by balsara , crutcher & pouquet ( 2001 ) .",
    "1 . magnetic reconnection and turbulence are inter - dependent processes .",
    "magnetic reconnection gets fast in the presence of turbulence , while mhd turbulence requires magnetic reconnection to develop eddy - type structures .",
    "turbulence in the presence of magnetic reconnection induces diffusion process that we term `` reconnection diffusion '' to stress the importance of magnetic reconnection for transporting magnetic fields and matter .",
