    "theoretical arguments @xcite and a recent analysis of wmap data @xcite show that the presence of a network of low - tension domain walls in the universe is not ruled out .",
    "moreover , domain walls could provide a natural and non - exotic alternative to the most popular candidates of dark energy @xcite .",
    "the evolution of vacuum domain walls in the early universe is determined by their interaction with the surrounding plasma .",
    "the two most relevant effects to be considered are the particle scattering off walls , and the presence of bound states near the walls , the so - called `` zero modes '' .",
    "the scattering of particles off walls ( including the scattering between walls ) determines the average velocity @xmath0 of a wall and thus , in turn , the equation of state of a gas of domain walls , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the energy density and pressure of the gas ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , when particles scatter off a wall , they generate a frictional force @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number density of particles of species @xmath6 , @xmath7 is their scattering probability ( the reflection coefficient ) , and @xmath8 is the momentum transfer per collision ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , defining the mean velocity of the walls as @xmath9 , the damping force can be written as @xmath10 , where we have defined the frictional coefficient @xmath11 .",
    "the mean velocity of a wall is determined by balancing the tension , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the surface energy density and the mean curvature radius of a wall , and the friction , @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting velocity is then @xmath16 .",
    "it is clear that a full analysis of the role of domain walls in the universe imposes the study of their interaction with particles in the primordial plasma .",
    "the presence of zero modes localized on a domain wall can be important for the stability of the wall .",
    "in particular , fermionic zero modes may give rise to interesting phenomena as the magnetization of domain walls @xcite , and the dynamical generation of massive ferromagnetic domain walls @xcite .",
    "indeed , fermionic zero modes could drastically change both gravitational properties and cosmic evolution of a gas of domain walls @xcite .",
    "the interaction of scalar particles and dirac fermions with a domain wall has been the object of various papers in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein , @xcite ) .",
    "since strong evidence for neutrino masses has emerged from various neutrino oscillation experiments in recent years @xcite , we are motivated to investigate the interaction of majorana fermions with domain walls ( neutrinos are neutral fermions , and then can have both majorana and dirac masses ) . in a recent paper @xcite , stojkovic has studied fermionic zero modes in the domain wall background , in the case in which the fermions have both dirac and left - handed and right - handed majorana mass terms .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the scattering of such fermions off domain walls .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the lagrangian for a single real self - interacting scalar field @xmath17 , coupled with a fermion @xmath18 having dirac , left - handed and right - handed majorana mass terms .",
    "we also derive the equations of motion . in section iii",
    "we calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients for the scattering of fermions off walls , in both cases in which the coupling to the scalar field @xmath17 is or not the source of the majorana mass terms .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section iv .",
    "we consider a simplified model in which the kink is a infinitely static domain wall in the @xmath19-plane . in this model",
    "the scalar sector giving rise to a planar wall is a real scalar field with density lagrangian @xmath20 in the tree approximation , the set of vacuum states is @xmath21 , so that one may assume that there are regions with @xmath22 and regions with @xmath23 . by continuity there",
    "must exists a region in which the scalar field is out of the vacuum .",
    "this region is a domain wall @xcite , and the classical equation of motion admits the solution describing the transition layer between two regions with different values of @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the thickness of the wall @xcite .",
    "+ now , we consider a fermion @xmath18 having dirac , left - handed and right - handed majorana mass terms .",
    "the source of the dirac and majorana mass terms is the yukawa couplings to the scalar field @xmath17 . in terms of the chiral spinors @xmath27 and @xmath28 the lagrangian density of the system is : ) in phenomenologically relevant models in neutrino physics , see ref . @xcite and references therein . ]",

    "it is clear that the chiral fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 do not have a definite mass , since they are coupled by the dirac mass term . in order to find the asymptotic states with definite masses , we have to diagonalise the mass matrix in lagrangian ( [ eq3 ] ) or , equivalently , we have to diagonalize the dirac equation , @xmath40 where we have introduced the following quantities : @xmath41 in the broken phase , eq .
