    "by margulis lemma , a finite - volume complete hyperbolic @xmath4-manifold @xmath5 has a finite number of ends called _ cusps _ , each of which is homeomorphic to @xmath6 for some closed euclidean @xmath7-manifold @xmath8 . in dimension three",
    "many knot complements provide an example of a hyperbolic manifold with a single cusp @xcite . in this",
    "setting the resulting manifolds are necessarily orientable , and since the torus @xmath9 is the only example of a closed euclidean surface , the cusp is homeomorphic to @xmath10 .    in higher dimensions , where there is no direct analogue to geometrisation ,",
    "constructing hyperbolic manifolds is a harder task .",
    "the goal is usually achieved by using either arithmetic methods , or producing direct constructions based on poincar s fundamental polytope theorem .",
    "it is also known that the cusp section of a single - cusped hyperbolic @xmath11-manifold can not have any possible homeomorphism type of a closed euclidean @xmath12-manifold @xcite .",
    "in fact , a necessary condition for such a manifold to be the cusp section of a single - cusped hyperbolic @xmath11-manifold is that its @xmath13-invariant is an integer , and such a condition is met by only four out of the six possible orientable homeomorphism types .",

    ".    it would also be interesting to generalise to dimension four the well - known @xmath12-dimensional examples of hyperbolic knot complements .",
    "a reasonable model would be the complement of a @xmath16-dimensional torus @xmath17 in @xmath18 .",
    "the boundary @xmath19 of a regular neighbourhood @xmath20 of @xmath17 will necessarily be homeomorphic to the @xmath12-torus @xmath21 .",
    "therefore @xmath19 will admit a euclidean structure , and we can hope to find a complete , finite volume hyperbolic structure on the complement of @xmath22 where @xmath19 corresponds to a cross - section of the cusp .    however we have to be careful : since a manifold @xmath23 of dimension @xmath24 can admit a variety of non - equivalent smooth structures , there is a sharp difference in saying that @xmath23 is _ homeomorphic _ or _ diffeomorphic _ to some preferred model of a smooth manifold .",
    "first examples of hyperbolic @xmath11-manifolds which are homeomorphic to complements of collections of @xmath16-dimensional tori in @xmath18 were given in @xcite .",
    "all the examples constructed there have more than one cusp , and each of these cusps is homeomorphic to @xmath25 , where @xmath21 denotes the three - dimensional torus . in @xcite , one of these manifolds ( equipped with the smooth structure induced by its hyperbolic metric )",
    "is shown to be diffeomorphic to the complement of a collection of five tori in @xmath18 with its standard smooth structure .    for a hyperbolic manifold @xmath23 ,",
    "being the complement of a collection of tori or klein bottles in @xmath18 implies strong restrictions on the geometry and topology of @xmath23 itself . a classical result due to h.c .",

    "moreover , in even dimensions , the volume of a hyperbolic @xmath4-manifold @xmath0 turns out to be proportional to the euler characteristic @xmath29 through the gau  bonnet formula ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) @xmath30    the euler characteristic of a four - dimensional hyperbolic manifold @xmath23 ( in general , non - compact , though finite - volume ) can take any positive integer value @xcite .",

    "setting , combining several properties of a manifold in a single example may become a difficult task ( e.g. we want to construct a complete hyperbolic finite - volume @xmath11-manifold with a single cusp , and a small volume ) . in the present paper we use the technique of colourings ( see @xcite ) in order to produce examples of single - cusped hyperbolic manifolds of euler characteristic @xmath16 .",
    "the main results are the following :    [ teo : nontoric ] there exists an orientable , complete , finite - volume hyperbolic @xmath11-manifold @xmath2 such that @xmath33 with a single cusp whose cross - section is homeomorphic to the euclidean orientable @xmath34-bundle over the klein bottle .",
