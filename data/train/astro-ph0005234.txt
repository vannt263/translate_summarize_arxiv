    "moreover , the areas where the theoretical predictions are most reliable tend to be those where the observational tests are most difficult at high redshift , e.g. , the evolution in the mass function of galaxies ( white & frenk 1991 ) . one testable prediction of hierarchical galaxy - formation models at high redshifts deals with the clustering behaviour of massive galaxies at early epochs : such galaxies are expected to cluster strongly in regions of highest density , areas which should subsequently form the cores of massive clusters of galaxies in the local universe ( kaiser 1984 ; baron & white 1987 ; efstathiou & rees 1988 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "thus by searching for over - densities of massive galaxies in the distant universe we can test the predictions of hierarchical models _ as well as _ investigating the formation and evolution of the luminous galaxies seen in present - day clusters .",
    "however , to achieve this we must find a method of selecting the densest regions in the early universe .",
    "one possible technique is to use massive galaxies as signposts for high - density environments at high redshifts .",

    "the chop throw was chosen to optimise calibration accuracy , minimise noise , maximise regions for which both ` on ' and ` off ' beam information would be available , and minimise the possibility of bright sources close to the field of view contaminating the map .",

    "the symmetric @xmath43 zero - flux beam ( which arises from chopping and nodding ) were deconvolved using a modified version of the clean algorithm ( hogbom 1974 ) as follows .",
    "the e  w- and n ",
    "s - chopped maps were treated separately for the purpose of deconvolution .",
    "first , both the image and the appropriate beam ( from contemporaneous maps of blazars ) were convolved with a gaussian ( fwhm 14@xmath9 , similar to the core of the jcmt beam at 850@xmath1 m ) .",
    "the smoothed image was then cleaned using the smoothed beam , down to a level equivalent to twice the r.m.s .",
    "noise of the smoothed data , using a loop - gain of 0.1 .",
    "this has the effect of gradually removing the positive core of a real source from the data , while at the same time filling in its negative sidelobes .",
    "when the process is complete , the original image is reduced to a map of background noise ( still containing real sources which are too faint to have been identified as significant peaks by the clean algorithm ) while the absolute values of removed flux are stored as a set of delta functions ( in the case of unresolved sources ) located at the positions of the original source peaks .",
    "the restored images were produced by halving the size of the delta functions then convolving them with a gaussian ( fwhm 14@xmath9 ) and adding them back into the residual noise image left by the cleaning process .",
    "the result is a restored image with the angular resolution of the original but free from negative sidelobes associated with significant sources .",
    "one advantage of this process is that it should resurrect any significant sources whose flux has been depressed ( or annihilated ) because they happen to lie in the negative sidelobe of another source , though only sources within 70@xmath9 of the field centre are treated properly by the cleaning procedure .",

    "it is interesting that our success in obtaining candidate identifications , in particular the association with eros , correlates with the observed flux density of the submm emission .",
    "is it possible that the brightest submm sources are typically associated with class  i or ii counterparts ( e.g.  hr10 , dey et al .  1999 ; smmj09429 + 4658 , smail et al .",
    "1999 ; smmj02399@xmath120136 , ivison et al .  1998 ; smmj14011 + 0252 , ivison et al .",
    "2000 ) whereas fainter submm sources typically have class  0 counterparts ( see also hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; smail et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "finally , we discuss whether the submm sources can be unambiguously placed at high redshifts , @xmath138 , and hence whether we can strengthen the case for their association with 4c41.17 . in the absence of deep spectroscopy of the counterparts discussed in  3.3 , we are reliant on other redshift - sensitive parameters .",
    "two examples are : @xmath94 ) the 450- to 850-@xmath1 m flux ratio , which falls steadily as the peak of the dust sed shifts through the 450-@xmath1 m filter at increasing redshift ; and @xmath95 ) the 850-@xmath1 m to 1.4-ghz flux ratio , based upon the local far - ir / radio correlation for star - forming galaxies , is a robust redshift indicator where @xmath139 at submm wavelengths , while @xmath140 in the radio , yielding a flux ratio that rises initially as @xmath141 ( carilli & yun 1999 , 2000 ; blain 1999 ; see also smail et al .  2000 )",
    ".    dealing with the 450- to 850-@xmath1 m flux ratio first , the observed ratios for 4c41.17 and hzrg850.1 are @xmath142 and @xmath143 , consistent with their being at the same redshift , with best - fit values and ranges of @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) and @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) , respectively , based on extreme models of starbursts ( hughes et al .",
    "these limits are supported by constraints from the 850-@xmath1 m to 1.4-ghz flux ratio . for hzrg850.1 , where @xmath148 ( taking radio limits of @xmath149@xmath1jy from the re - reduced radio image published originally by carilli , owen & harris 1994 ) , we arrive at a robust limit of @xmath150 .",
    "the limits for hzrg850.2 and hzrg850.3 are slightly weaker , but they are certainly not local galaxies .",
    "the extreme colors , @xmath125 , of the probable galaxy counterparts to hzrg850.1 and hzrg850.2 , as well as the faintness of the counterparts to the remaining sources , suggests that these systems also lie at high redshifts .",
    "the @xmath24-band magnitudes for the candidate identifications quoted are fairly bright : if these galaxies do lie at @xmath0 then they are very luminous , in excess of 50@xmath151 , although we note that luminosities close to this are found for the confirmed class ii counterparts smmj02399@xmath120136 ( @xmath152 , ivison et al .  1998 ) and smmj14011 + 0252 ( @xmath153 , ivison et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "we conclude that the available constraints suggest that the over - density of bright submm galaxies identified in the 4c41.17 field is likely to lie at @xmath154 and hence is consistent with being associated with the radio galaxy at @xmath0 ( though spectroscopic confirmation is clearly a top priority ) .",
    "this suggests that in addition to the proposed over - density of lyman - break galaxies identified around 4c41.17 by lacy & rawlings ( 1996 ) , we should also add a comparably numerous population of highly - obscured and very luminous submm galaxies .",
    "we report the discovery of five new luminous submm sources within a @xmath155-diameter ( 1mpc at @xmath0 ) area centered on the submm - bright @xmath0 radio galaxy , 4c41.17 .",
    "three of these sources are as bright or brighter than any other known blank - field submm galaxies .",
    "this surface density of submm galaxies is an order of magnitude greater than that expected from blank - field counts : we would need to map at least 600 blank fields to find a chance configuration of such bright sources . using the available constraints",
    ", we suggest that this over - density lies at @xmath154 and is therefore consistent with a structure associated with 4c41.17 .",
    "we note that this field exhibits an over - density above that expected in blank fields , not only at submm wavelengths , but also in samples of galaxies selected via the lyman - break technique ( lacy & rawlings 1996 ) and for their extremely red colors ( eros ) .",
    "as many as five of the latter class of galaxies may be directly associated with the luminous submm sources seen in this field .",
    "we introduce a classification scheme for the counterparts of submm sources , based upon observations of well - studied scuba galaxies . within the framework of this scheme",
    "we propose that submm galaxies and ero starbursts represent different aspects of a single evolutionary cycle .",
    "following on from this , we suggest that the over - densities of both the submm and ero populations in this field represent young , dusty starbursts forming within a proto - cluster centered on the radio galaxy at @xmath0 , which also hosts a population of less - obscured lyman - break galaxies .",
    "more observations are clearly needed to confirm the nature of this over - density , to test our suggestion that it is associated with the radio source at @xmath0 and , most interestingly , to investigate if it represents a virialised structure .",
    "the most feasible test of the latter issue will be to image this field using the _ chandra _ or _ newton _ x - ray observatories to identify emission from the hot intracluster medium confined within the potential well of the proposed proto - cluster .",
    "we are currently expanding our survey to cover 15 fields centered on hzrgs to determine more reliable limits on the prevalence of similar over - densities of submm sources around massive galaxies at high redshifts , @xmath1565 .",
