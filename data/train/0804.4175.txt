    "early type galaxies with quiescent stellar populations form a well - defined color - magnitude or color - mass relation at @xmath15 , known as the red sequence .",
    "they are clearly separated from blue star - forming galaxies , which populate a different , less - tight sequence , called the blue cloud . while the red sequence is primarily build up of massive galaxies , blue galaxies have lower stellar masses ( e.g , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . both the shape and the color of the red sequence evolve over cosmic time .",
    "several processes are responsible for this evolution .",
    "first , the color gradually reddens due to aging of stellar populations .",
    "second , the red sequence grows through transformations of blue galaxies .",
    "these transformations change the mix of properties of red - sequence galaxies and may cause the observed evolution of the red sequence to deviate from the expectations from passive evolution .",
    "third , mergers among red - sequence galaxies change the red - galaxy mass function and may affect the color , slope , and scatter of the red sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the evolution of the color , the shape , the number and mass density of the red sequence sets direct constraints on the assembly and star formation history of massive , early - type galaxies .    the evolution of the red sequence between @xmath16 and @xmath15 has extensively been studied for this purpose .",
    "overall , these studies find that the color evolution is consistent with passive evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mass on the red sequence doubles in this redshift interval ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the growth at higher masses is attributed to both red mergers and galaxy transformations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as a significant part of the red sequence was already in place at @xmath16 , we have to push our studies to higher redshift to trace the onset and first build up of the red sequence .",

    "moreover , developments in nir instrumentation have enabled the first spectroscopic confirmations of quiescent galaxies without detected emission lines beyond @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in particular the cross - dispersed mode of the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a wavelength coverage of 1 - 2.5 @xmath17 m allows systematic studies of massive galaxies at @xmath0 . using this instrument",
    "we have completed a nir spectroscopic study of 36 @xmath18-selected galaxies at @xmath19 . in this paper",
    "we use this survey to study the onset and color evolution of the red sequence .",
    "the spectroscopic redshifts in combination with the accurate continuum shapes as provided by the nir spectra , allow for the first time accurate rest - frame color determinations of quiescent , massive galaxies beyond @xmath1 .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume a @xmath20cdm cosmology with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23  km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 , and a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) between 0.1 and 100 @xmath25 .",

    "we show that distribution of the rest - frame @xmath27 and observed @xmath28 colors of our spectroscopic sample are representative of a mass limited sample at @xmath3 .",
    "however , we do note that we are biased towards galaxies with brighter @xmath18-band magnitudes .",
    "although this mainly reflects the relatively lower redshifts of these galaxies , as explained in detail in kriek et al .",

    "further details about sample completeness , observations , reduction and extraction of the spectra can also be found in @xcite .    for this work we use the 28 galaxies within the range @xmath30 .",
    "stellar masses and other population properties are derived by stellar population modeling as described in detail in @xcite , and given in table 2 in @xcite . in summary",
    ", we fit the spectra together with the broadband optical photometry by @xcite stellar population models , assuming an exponentially declining star formation history , solar metallicity , the @xcite reddening law and the @xcite imf between 0.1 and 100 @xmath25 .",
    "we allow a grid of 41 values for @xmath31 between 0 and 4 mag , 31 values for the characteristic star - forming timescale ( @xmath32 ) between 10 myr and 10 gyr , and 24 values for age ( not exceeding the age of the universe ) .",
    "uncertainties on the stellar population properties are derived using 200 monte carlo simulations as described in @xcite .",
    "we leave redshift as a free parameter for galaxies without emission lines .",
    "we tested the continuum redshifts using the emission - line galaxies in our sample , and found an uncertainty in @xmath33 of less than 0.019 @xcite .",
    "rest - frame @xmath2 colors are also determined from the best - fit stellar population models . in the same fashion as for the stellar population properties ,",
    "confidence levels are derived from monte carlo simulations .",
    "hence , the confidence intervals on the rest - frame colors include the uncertainties on the continuum redshifts for galaxies without emission lines .",
    "the colors are not measured directly from the spectra , as for several galaxies the @xmath34-band is not covered completely by the nir spectrum , or the @xmath35-band falls partly in between the @xmath36 and @xmath37 atmospheric windows .",
    "as our grid allows almost 30  000 different synthetic spectra , we do not expect the colors to converge to certain best - fit templates . nevertheless , in order to examine whether using best fits may introduce systematics in the derived rest - frame colors , we directly measure the colors from the nir spectra in combination with the optical broadband photometry .",
    "we find no systematic offset between the direct colors and those derived from the best fits .",
    "the unique aspects of this data set are the accurate spectroscopic redshifts , rest - frame colors and masses .",
    "although broadband photometric studies provide much larger galaxy samples , they lack the accuracy needed for this study .",
    "figures  [ fig : ub_mass]a and b present rest - frame @xmath2 color versus stellar mass for the @xmath3 massive galaxy sample .",
    "the colors are corrected for redshift differences within the sample , as will be explained in ",
    "[ sec : rs_col ] . these correction are very small ( @xmath70.001 ) , and barely change the appearance of this plot .",
    "the distribution of galaxies in figures  [ fig : ub_mass]a and b is striking , as there are many galaxies with similar , red colors . in order to test whether a red sequence was already in place at this early epoch",
    ", we examine the rest - frame color distribution .",
    "but first we correct the colors for the tilt of the red sequence , by assuming the slope of @xmath39 red sequence @xcite .",
    "the applied correction has the form @xmath40 the residuals are shown by the black histograms in figures  [ fig : ub_mass]c and d. the distribution exhibits a conspicuous peak at @xmath41 mag .",
    "we test the significance of the red sequence by calculating the probability to obtain this peak when assuming a flat distribution in rest - frame @xmath2 color .",
    "if the true distribution is uniform the probability of finding nine or more galaxies in any one of the three red bins and finding 16 or more galaxies in total with @xmath42 is less than 0.001 .",
    "thus the change of finding the detected red sequence by change is less than 0.1% .",
    "this implies that the detection of the red sequence is significant at the @xmath4 level .",
    "this all strongly suggests that a red sequence of massive field galaxies was most likely already in place at @xmath0 .",
    "we determine the location of the peak of the red sequence by fitting a gaussian to the color distribution .",
    "we average over many binning positions to obtain a distribution that is not affected by the particular choice of binning . in order to avoid including blue - cloud galaxies ,",
    "we restrict the fitting region to all galaxies with @xmath43 .",
    "hence , this procedures requires a few iterations .",
    "the cut - off value of 0.1 mag is chosen as it is twice the scatter in rest - frame @xmath2 color of the local red sequence ( see   [ sec : rs_col ] ) .",
    "the best fit is indicated by the solid curve in figures  [ fig : ub_mass]c and d. the peak of the distribution is shown by the solid orange line in figures  [ fig : ub_mass]a and b. all galaxies above the dotted line ( @xmath44_{m } > [ u - b]_{\\rm    peak}-0.1 $ ] ) are defined as red - sequence galaxies from hereon .",
    "our result may seem in disagreement with previous studies , some of which indicate that the red sequence disappears beyond @xmath45 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , finding a red sequence , as is well known , requires very accurate rest - frame color determinations .",
    "the use of a galaxy sample with spectroscopic redshifts and stellar continuum shapes  _ and not just photometric information _  enables us to detect a significant red sequence beyond @xmath1 , in contrast to previous studies .",
    "broadband photometry in combination with photometric redshifts with errors of @xmath46 gives random errors of 0.1 mag in rest - frame @xmath2 , and systematic errors may play an even larger role .",
    "furthermore , the typical uncertainties on stellar mass and absolute magnitude are a factor of @xmath47 and @xmath48 mag , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , the uncertainties on the location of the individual red - sequence galaxies are larger than the width of the intrinsic red sequence .",
    "this implies that photometric studies with errors of @xmath49 in @xmath33 are not able to recover a red sequence .",
    "studies that lack spectroscopic redshifts in the relevant redshift range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to calibrate their photometric redshifts , most likely have even larger errors in @xmath33 .",
    "whereas we do detect a significant red sequence , we find no bimodality in the galaxy distribution .",
    "we can not reliably comment on bimodality since larger samples over a larger mass range are needed to assess whether the blue galaxies are distinct from the red ones at this epoch .",
    "nonetheless , recent work by @xcite , based on a spectroscopic study over a larger stellar mass range , shows that the galaxy bimodality exist at least out to a redshift of @xmath1 .",
    "we note that the study by @xcite is based on spectroscopic redshifts , reinforcing our hypothesis that the current result can only be obtained with redshifts more accurate than the standard photometric redshifts .",
    "finally , we stress that the detection of a red sequence is independent on whether the sample is fully representative of a mass - limited sample . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that the red sequence has originally been discovered and mainly studied in magnitude- and not mass - limited samples .      in the previous section we showed that a red sequence was already in place at @xmath0 .",
    "the well - defined shape of the red sequence could be a consequence of the converging colors of evolved galaxies .",
    "however , our sample is small , and dusty starburst galaxies , known to be highly abundant at these redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may contribute to , or even dominate the red sequence at these early epochs . in order to test whether these red - sequence galaxies indeed host quiescent stellar population , we examine the star formation properties using several diagnostics .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ub_mass]a the galaxies are coded following their best - fit specific sfr derived from modeling their stellar continua ( see   [ sec : data ] and * ? ? ?",
    "the corresponding color distributions are presented in figure  [ fig : ub_mass]c .",
    "most red - sequence galaxies are best - fit by specific sfrs less than 0.05  gyr@xmath24 , and three have specific sfrs between 0.05 and 0.5  gyr@xmath24 .",
    "the uncertainties on the specific sfrs are about a factor of @xmath50 on average @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the large fraction of galaxies with low specific sfrs suggests that red sequence is not dominated by dusty starbursts .    a combination of two rest - frame colors , such that one isolates the optical break , and the other color measures the slope of the spectrum redwards of the optical break ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may also be used to discriminate between dusty star - forming galaxies and quiescent stellar populations . in figure  [ fig : ub_bv ] we show rest - frame @xmath2 versus @xmath6 for all galaxies at @xmath3 .",
    "color evolution tracks of @xcite models show that quiescent stellar populations have a different locus than dusty starbursts .",
    "as expected , the red - sequence galaxies are closer to the simple stellar population ( ssp ) model tracks .",
    "the remaining galaxies can roughly be divided in those that have colors more comparable to constant star forming ( csf ) models with dust , and galaxies that will probably soon join the red sequence .",
    "these results are supported by independent emission line diagnostics , presented in figure  [ fig : ub_mass]b and d. we divide the sample according to whether emission lines are detected in the rest - frame optical spectra .",
    "subsequently , the emission - line galaxies are sorted for the dominant origin of their line emission : using primarily emission - line ratios we discriminate between active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and hii regions @xcite . for two galaxies we have no information on the line emission as the lines are expected at wavelengths with low atmospheric transmission .",
    "13 out of 15 red - sequence galaxies have no detected emission lines , or the line emission is dominated by agns .",
    "thus , both the stellar continua and the emission line diagnostics suggest that the red sequence at @xmath0 is dominated by galaxies with quiescent stellar populations .",
    "in particular , 7 out of 9 previously identified galaxies with strongly suppressed star formation presented in @xcite fall on this red sequence .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath2 colors of the two remaining galaxies with strongly suppressed star formation are just below the cut - off value , and their locus in figure  [ fig : ub_bv ] is near the ssp track .",
    "thus , they will most likely soon join the red sequence .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath6 colors in combination with @xmath2 indicate that the red - sequence galaxies at @xmath0 are likely in a post - starburst phase ( figure  [ fig : ub_bv ] ) .",
    "this is further illustrated in figure  [ fig : stack ] , in which we show the stacked low - resolution spectrum of all red - sequence galaxies .",
    "for comparison we show a 2 gyr ssp model with a prominent 4000   break as well .",
    "in contrast to such old stellar populations , the optical break for the @xmath0 red - sequence galaxies is clearly dominated by the balmer break .",
    "overall , our findings may imply that the massive end of the red sequence is just starting to build up at @xmath0 , and was likely not yet in place beyond @xmath51 .",
    "@xcite drew the same conclusion by studying the stellar populations in protoclusters at @xmath52 .",
    "our work is also consistent with the study by @xcite who found that in contrast to @xmath53 , red galaxies at @xmath54 have significant uv emission and are thus still actively forming stars .",
    "we note , however , that as explained in  2 , we might be missing galaxies with higher @xmath29 , as these are relatively faint in @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ fig : ub_bv ] provides us with a clear illustration of the different processes that may be responsible for the spread and the tilt of the red sequence at @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath6 show a positive correlation for the red - sequence galaxies .",
    "the typical 1@xmath55 confidence contour shows that random errors can not fully account for the spread , and other effects are likely to play a role .",
    "the two ssp tracks , indicated by the dashed lines , show that both age and metallicity differences may be responsible for the spread and the tilt .",
    "also the redshift spread of the red sequence galaxies , corresponding to 0.5 gyr , will induce scatter in colors .",
    "finally , reddening by dust moves a galaxy in a similar direction as aging and metallicity , and may also contribute to the spread and the tilt of the red sequence .",
    "the importance of the different processes can not be addressed with the current data , and independent dust , age , and metallicity constraints are required to break the degeneracies .",
    "finally , we stress that , although the star formation activity in the red - sequence galaxies appears low , the galaxies may still be reddened by fair amounts of dust .",
    "best - fit stellar population models indicate an average dust content of @xmath56mag ( using the calzetti reddening law ) .",
    "however , due to degeneracies between age and dust , @xmath31 is poorly constrained with typical uncertainties of 0.5mag @xcite , and dust - free models provide almost equally good fits to the spectra @xcite .",
    "metallicity ( @xmath57 ) further complicates this degeneracy , and as it is fixed to @xmath58 during fitting , the lack of appropriate metallicities may have been compensated by adjusting age or @xmath31 .",
    "independent indicators , such as mid - infrared ( mir ) imaging or balmer decrements are needed to better constrain the dust content in these red - sequence galaxies .",
    "mir imaging also reveals whether obscured star - forming regions may have been missed . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite and @xcite show that about half of the galaxies at the high mass - end of the galaxy distribution at @xmath0 are not detected at 24@xmath59 .",
    "moreover , @xcite find that the h@xmath60 luminosity for @xmath61 galaxies tracks the bolometric luminosity very well .",
    "finally , large amounts of dust in all red - sequence galaxies studied in this work seems unlikely , because it would then be hard to explain the narrow peak in the observed color distribution .",
    "in order to measure the rest - frame @xmath2 evolution of the red sequence , we compare our @xmath0 results with those of lower redshift samples in this section .",
    "we use two spectroscopic massive galaxy samples ( @xmath62 ) at @xmath8 and @xmath9 , extracted from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , data release 5 ( dr5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , respectively .",
    "for our lowest redshift sample we use a complete , mass - selected , volume - limited sample of galaxies at redshifts @xmath8 , extracted from the sdss . see @xcite for more details about the extraction and completeness of the sample .",
    "the sdss @xmath63 and @xmath64 colors are used to derive rest - frame @xmath2 colors , @xmath35 , and @xmath65 bands used in this paper are slightly different from those adopted in @xcite .",
    "the conversions used in this paper are the same as used by @xcite . ] .",
    "@xmath29 are derived from the @xmath64 colors ( corrected for galactic extinction and redshift ) using the relation by @xcite .",
    "the inferred stellar masses are increased by 0.15 dex to account for differences in the imf .",
    "the final massive ( @xmath66 ) galaxy sample consists of 903 galaxies .    for the intermediate redshift sample at @xmath9",
    ", we use a mass - selected , volume - limited galaxy sample , constructed from goods - south . a detailed description of the extraction of the sample and completeness can be found in @xcite .",
    "rest - frame @xmath2 and @xmath6 colors for the @xmath9 sample are derived from the f606w , i775w and f850lp acs photometry .",
    "subsequently , @xmath6 provides us with stellar masses , using the empirical relations by @xcite .",
    "again , the stellar masses are increased by 0.15 dex . of this sample ,",
    "137 galaxies have masses @xmath66 .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts are known for 70% of this sample @xcite . as this spectroscopic sample",
    "is not fully representative of the total sample , we include the galaxies with photometric redshifts @xcite when appropriate .      for an accurate measurement of the @xmath2 color evolution ,",
    "it is crucial to derive the color of the red sequence in a similar fashion as for our @xmath0 sample . in the top panels of figure  [ fig : ub_hist ] we show rest - frame @xmath2 versus stellar mass for all three massive galaxies samples .",
    "the colors are corrected for redshift differences within each subsample , in a self - consistent way , by using the evolution of the red - sequence color with time derived below .",
    "next , we subtract equation  ( [ eq : ub_m ] ) from the data and determine the peak of the color distribution in the same way as was done for the @xmath67 sample .",
    "the extracted color distribution along the @xmath68 slope is presented in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : ub_hist ] .",
    "galaxies with colors @xmath69 are defined as belonging to the red sequence .",
    "the peak locations are indicated by solid lines in figure  [ fig : ub_hist ] . for the @xmath9 galaxies we exclude the 30% without spectroscopic redshifts when deriving the peak of the red sequence , as these galaxies have less accurate rest - frame colors .",
    "random errors on the location of the red sequence are determined using bootstrapping , and are represented by the dotted lines in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : ub_hist ] .",
    "the use of different samples and different method to derive rest - frame colors and stellar masses may introduce additional systematic errors . in order to correctly interpret the observed evolution , we examine the following effects .      _ aperture differences _",
    "elliptical galaxies exhibit color gradients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , differences in the apertures that were used to measure rest - frame @xmath2 may introduce systematics in the color evolution .",
    "for both the @xmath70 and @xmath71 sample the rest - frame @xmath2 colors are derived for an aperture which is about equivalent to the half - light radius .",
    "for the @xmath0 sample we use the nir spectra to measure rest - frame @xmath2 .",
    "the aperture sizes are rectangular and depend on the slitwidth ( of 0675 ) , the extraction aperture , and extraction method .",
    "we use a weighted ( with s / n ) extraction and include spatial elements that have a flux larger than @xmath72 times the maximum flux @xcite . thus , the total aperture size is dependent on the light distribution of the galaxy .",
    "the average effective aperture of the @xmath67 sample is comparable to a circular aperture of @xmath12kpc .    in order to quantify possible systematics in rest - frame @xmath2 determinations of red - sequence galaxies between the @xmath73 and @xmath0 samples",
    ", we measure rest - frame @xmath2 for all galaxies in the @xmath71 sample using an aperture of 1(@xmath77.6 kpc at @xmath71 ) instead of 05 .",
    "this aperture size is comparable to that used for the @xmath0 sample .",
    "for the increased aperture the @xmath2 color of the @xmath71 red sequence is 0.01 mag bluer . in order to correct for this effect",
    ", we have reduced the colors of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 galaxies by 0.01 mag .    ",
    "_ zero points _",
    "uncertainties in zero points directly result in systematic uncertainties in the derived rest - frame colors .",
    "the uncertainty on individual zero points is @xmath74 mag for both the @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite samples .",
    "thus , the resulting uncertainty on @xmath2 is @xmath75 mag . for the @xmath0 sample we use av0-type stars for calibrating the spectra .",
    "this results in an uncertainty on rest - frame @xmath2 of @xmath76 mag . for this sample",
    "the broadband photometry provides us with an independent check on the zero points . in @xcite",
    "we find a systematic offset of @xmath77 mag between rest - frame @xmath27 derived from the photometry ( using @xmath78 ) and the nir spectra .",
    "this shows that the zero points probably introduce no large systematics for the @xmath0 sample .    ",
    "_ rest - frame color determinations _  the determination of rest - frame colors may also result in systematic errors . for the low and intermediate redshift samples we use the photometry in combination with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "this method may result in systematics of @xmath77 mag and @xmath76 mag for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 samples , respectively .",
    "for the @xmath0 sample we have higher resolution spectral shapes , provided by the nir spectra . in the previous paragraph and in   [ sec : data ] we discussed two tests to assess rest - frame color determinations , and neither of them exhibit significant systematics ( @xmath77 mag ) .      _ stellar mass determinations _",
    "although the stellar masses are all determined for the same imf , the different methods used for the @xmath73 and @xmath0 samples may have introduced systematic errors .",
    "we tested this by determining the stellar masses for the @xmath0 galaxies using the same method as for the lower redshift samples .",
    "this yielded stellar masses which are typically 0.13 dex less than the best - fit stellar masses .",
    "this may be due to younger and dustier stellar populations of the @xmath0 massive galaxies .",
    "as the slope of the red sequence is 0.08 mag dex@xmath24 , this may result in a systematic error of @xmath70.01 mag on the observed color evolution . furthermore",
    ", this effect may also alter the cut - off value of @xmath79 , and consequently the selection of massive red - sequence galaxies .",
    "increasing the mass cut - off value by 0.13 dex would not change the peak location of the red sequence .",
    "however , the number and mass fractions of massive galaxies on the red - sequence would increase by @xmath710% .    ",
    "_ completeness _  the @xmath70 sample is volume limited , and thus completeness effects are not expected to play a role . for the @xmath71 sample we use just the spectroscopic subsample to estimate the red - sequence color , as photometric redshifts results in less accurate rest - frame colors . however , including all galaxies , would give a rest - frame @xmath2 color which is 0.01 mag less .",
    "thus , completeness effects may result in a systematic error of @xmath77 for the @xmath71 sample .",
    "the @xmath67 sample is much smaller and not volume limited . in @xcite we find that the distributions of rest - frame @xmath27 color , observed @xmath28 and @xmath80 color and redshift for the spectroscopic sample at @xmath3 are similar as for a photometric mass- and volume - limited sample at the same redshift interval .",
    "unfortunately , we can only compare photometric properties in order to investigate whether the subsample is representative , and thus systematics in photometric studies may jeopardize the real completeness .",
    "for example , in @xcite we identified systematics between photometric redshift and sed type , such that dusty , young galaxies were generally placed at too high redshifts .",
    "as these dusty galaxies scattered to lower redshift , they are not included in the sample used in this work .",
    "dusty galaxies with @xmath81 may not be properly represented in the sample , as they were initially placed at too high redshift .",
    "although this possible incompleteness may not alter our findings of the color of the red sequence , it should be kept in mind that the sample may not be complete and representative of the total population of @xmath3 galaxies .",
    "we estimate that completeness effects may result in a systematic error of @xmath76 mag on the rest - frame @xmath2 color of the @xmath0 red sequence .",
    "the various effects discussed above result in total systematic uncertainties of 0.03 , 0.04 and 0.05 mag for the @xmath68 , @xmath82 and @xmath0 red - sequence colors respectively .",
    "we assume that the random and systematic errors are independent and can be added in quadrature .",

    "in addition to @xmath14 , the evolution of the number and mass density of red - sequence galaxies places constraints on the build up of the red sequence .",
    "the densities for the @xmath73 samples follow directly from the used samples , as both are volume limited . to obtain the relative fractions at @xmath71 we use the full @xmath9 sample , including galaxies with photometric redshifts , in combination with the red - sequence location as derived from the spectroscopic sample .",
    "the galaxies at @xmath3 do not form a complete sample .",

    "* ) to estimate the total number of massive galaxies ( @xmath62 ) at @xmath3 ( see   [ sec : data ] ) .",

    "this value is consistent with the values found by @xcite of @xmath86 and by @xcite of @xmath87 for the same mass - cut and imf .",
    "subsequently we use the mass and number fractions , as estimated from the spectroscopic sample to derive the mass and number densities of red - sequence galaxies .",
    "we find a number density of massive red - sequence galaxies at @xmath0 of @xmath88 .",
    "all number and mass densities are given in table  [ tab : rs ] .",
    "the uncertainties on the fractions are determined by bootstrapping ( see   [ sec : rs_col ] ) . for the number and mass densities ,",
    "the uncertainties include cosmic variance , random errors , uncertainties on the fractions , and uncertainties introduced by different stellar mass estimators .",
    "the _ fraction _ of the total massive galaxy population that is on the red sequence has evolved by only @xmath89% from @xmath0 to the present .",
    "similarly , the fraction of the total stellar mass in galaxies with @xmath90 that is on the red sequence has evolved by @xmath91% .",
    "however , the total number and total mass of red sequence galaxies has increased by factors of @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively over this time interval .      in this section",
    "we discuss our results in the context of other studies that investigated the evolution of the red sequence .",
    "however , when comparing our findings to these studies , it is important to keep in mind the difference in sample selection and red - sequence definition .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite find no red - sequence galaxies among their @xmath61 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , as the galaxies are selected by their bright optical flux , and thus they only target star - forming galaxies .",
    "only 20% of a mass - limited sample would be identified by lbg selection , and thus this selection technique is not suitable for obtaining unbiased mass - limited samples @xcite .    using a mass - limited sample with a wide variety of data over a total field of 1.53 @xmath92 , @xcite find that the red - sequence fraction of galaxies with @xmath93 increases from 0.65 to 0.88 between @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "direct comparison with our work is complicated by the different mass range , a different adopted imf @xcite , and different color criteria to identify red - sequence galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , the slight decrease of this fraction may be consistent with the findings presented in this work .",
    "our study is also broadly consistent with the results of the k20 survey .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath730 - 40% of the present day stellar mass in objects with @xmath96 appears to be in place at @xmath61 .",
    "we find that for @xmath97 20% of the mass was already in place at a slightly higher redshift of @xmath0 .",
    "given the large uncertainties of both studies , the different mass cuts , and the different targeted redshift range , these results are not in conflict with each other .",
    "their relative fraction of red to blue sequence galaxies is difficult to compare to ours , as k20 has spectroscopic redshifts and classifications for 43% of the galaxies at @xmath98 .",
    "21% are early types and 22% are late types .",
    "so for more than half of the sample the nature of the galaxy is unknown .",
    "as late types are easier to spectroscopically confirm ( especially with optical spectroscopy ) than early types , it is not unlikely that the early types span the majority at this redshift range .",
    "thus , their result is not inconsistent with the fractions we find for our spectroscopic sample at z@xmath72.3 .",
    "@xcite find that less than half of the galaxies exceed their red - sequence cut .",
    "however , these authors use a @xmath18-selected , instead of a mass - limited sample .",
    "@xmath18-selection gives higher fractions of blue galaxies , as such galaxies are brighter in @xmath18 than red galaxies at the same stellar mass .",
    "also , since their color distribution shows no obvious peak , their definition of the red - sequence galaxies can not be directly compared to ours .",
    "finally , @xcite identify color bimodality out to z=2 among the galaxies in the gmass survey .",
    "their sample has a spectroscopic completeness of 50% , with 190 spectroscopic redshifts beyond z=1.4 .",
    "the authors show that early - type galaxies make up 50% of the population at the high mass end at @xmath1 . when imposing the same color and mass cut as used in this paper , we derive that red - sequence galaxies would dominate .",
    "furthermore , in agreement with our study , they find that the rest - frame @xmath2 color evolves by only @xmath99 mag between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .    in summary",
    ", it is difficult to directly compare our results with other studies , as few in the targeted redshift range use mass limited samples . even more importantly , as already discussed in   3.1 , the lack of spectroscopic information prevents accurate rest - frame color determinations of red galaxies for current @xmath102 studies .",
    "nevertheless , our study seems broadly consistent with other work .",
    "in the previous section we derived the evolution of rest - frame @xmath2 color and the number density for the massive end ( @xmath66 ) of the red sequence between @xmath0 and the present . in this section",
    "we attempt to explain this evolution using simple models .",
    "the red - sequence galaxies at @xmath0 have no or very little ongoing star formation and thus are expected to evolve passively over time .",
    "therefore , simple aging of stellar populations seems the most straightforward explanation for the observed color evolution . in figure",
    "[ fig : dub_t]a we compare the measured @xmath2 color evolution to single burst , solar metallicity models by both @xcite and @xcite . in   [ sec : rs_hz ] we determine that the @xmath0 galaxies are in a post - starburst phase , with typical ages of @xmath70.5 and @xmath71 gyr for dust and dust - free models , respectively @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume a formation redshift of the stars of @xmath103 . for comparison we also give a subsolar model ( @xmath104 ) and a model with infinite formation redshift , both from the @xcite library .",
    "figure  [ fig : dub_t]a shows that passive stellar population models with @xmath103 and solar metallicity predict a too strong color evolution , and produce galaxies at @xmath15 that are too red .",
    "only sub - solar models can explain the observed evolution at @xmath105 .",
    "however , this is in contradiction with studies of local ellipticals with similar stellar masses , which imply solar to supersolar metallicities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps more importantly , passive evolution models do not predict any evolution in the density of galaxies on the red sequence , in clear conflict with the observations ( see solid curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : dnd_t ] ) .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the red sequence is more complicated than just aging . in the following sections we discuss different processes that may have depressed the color evolution .",
    "not all galaxies stop forming stars at high redshift , and the red sequence will be constantly supplemented by newly quenched galaxies .",
    "galaxies that move to the red sequence at later times will be bluer than the galaxies that already reside on the red sequence , and subsequently will flatten the total color evolution .",
    "this effect is known as the progenitor bias @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , such models can reduce the apparent color evolution while there is rapid density evolution and a constant influx of relatively young galaxies to the red sequence .",
    "we apply a simple model in order to test whether including progenitor bias can explain the observed evolution .",
    "we assume a formation period of 100 myr around @xmath106 in which all galaxies are formed .",
    "the individual galaxies are quenched at @xmath107 , following the probability distribution of @xmath108 : @xmath109 we use @xcite models to construct the composite evolution from the color evolution of individual galaxies .",
    "we simulate 10  000 galaxies and determine the red - sequence color using the same method as used for the data ( see   [ sec : rs_col ] ) .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we assume a constant sfr between @xmath110 and @xmath107 .    in figure  [",
    "fig : dub_t]b we examine whether the supply of newly quenched galaxies can explain the observed @xmath2 evolution .",
    "the dotted curve represents the evolution for an exponentially declining quenching model ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "the formation time has been set such that , consistent with the observations , the @xmath0 red - sequence galaxies have stopped forming stars for @xmath71  gyr ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "this model reduces @xmath113 compared to just aging ( solid line ) , but matches neither the observed color nor the number density evolution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dnd_t ] ) .    one way to further decline the color evolution and better match the observed number density evolution , is increasing @xmath108 to infinity .",
    "however , a more realistic model would be to vary @xmath114 in addition to @xmath107 .",
    "we define the probability distribution of the formation time of the galaxies as @xmath115 the dashed curve in figure  [ fig : dub_t]b represents the model with exponentially declining formation and quenching rates ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "also for this model we assume a minimum formation redshift such that on average red - sequence galaxies at @xmath0 have quenched their star formation 1 gyr ago ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "this model provides a better fit to @xmath113 than the previous two models , and matches the evolution of the number density of massive red - sequence galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dnd_t ] ) . nonetheless , the predicted color evolution for @xmath119 red - sequence galaxies is still too slow , and other processes may be needed to match the color evolution .",
    "we note , however , that the stellar population models by @xcite would have provided a slightly better fit to the observed color evolution .",
    "mergers on the red sequence may also alter the color evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that no star - formation is triggered or other major processes take place , merging of two red sequence galaxies increases the stellar mass , but leave the color unchanged .",
    "thus red galaxy mergers shift the red sequence to higher masses , and consequently reduce the color evolution when measured at fixed mass .    the dashed - dotted curve in figure  [ fig : dub_t]b represents the color evolution when including red mergers , in addition to aging and a varying @xmath110 and @xmath107 .",
    "we assume a constant merger rate , normalized such that red - sequence galaxies experience one equal mass merger between @xmath16 and the present .",
    "figure  [ fig : dub_t]b shows that the combined model provides a reasonable fit to the observed evolution .",
    "if we ignore galaxy transformations , we need 5 - 7 major mergers between @xmath0 and the present to provide a good fit to the observed color evolution .",
    "observational evidence for red mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) validates this explanation .",
    "however , the corresponding decline in the rest - frame @xmath2 color evolution in this study might be overestimated .",
    "first , our assumed merger rates between @xmath16 and @xmath120 may be too high , as accurate observational constraints are still lacking .",
    "furthermore , not all major mergers are equal mass mergers , and for example a 3:1 merger ( @xmath121$]=0.020 mag ) has less impact on the evolution than a 1:1 merger ( @xmath121$]=0.024 mag ) .",
    "the effects of red mergers on the number density evolution are difficult to estimate using the simple models presented in this work . the merger rate may be dependent on mass , and accurate mass functions are needed to understand the growth of the red sequence due to red mergers ( see * ? ? ?",
    "although a combination of aging , quenching , and red mergers provides a good fit to observed evolution , there may be other possible explanation as well .",
    "one concern is the unknown dust content of red - sequence galaxies , especially at @xmath0 .",
    "the well - defined shape of the @xmath0 red - sequence makes large dust contents implausible .",
    "however , as these galaxies recently stopped forming stars , they may still be in the process of losing their dust .",
    "the red - sequence galaxies have a median best - fit @xmath31 of 0.8 mag , but the constraints are poor with typical @xmath122 errors of 0.5 mag .",
    "furthermore , as explained in ",
    "[ sec : pop_rs ] , the degeneracy with metallicity may introduce an additional systematic error .",
    "nonetheless , an @xmath31 of 0.8 mag would lower the @xmath0 red - sequence color in figure  [ fig : dub_t ] by 0.16 mag ( for a * ? ? ?",
    "* reddening law ) .",
    "the resulting evolution requires a later formation redshift , and this results in a slightly bluer color at low redshift .",
    "however , this effect is very small , and thus dust can not be primarily responsible for the slow observed color evolution .",
    "new starbursts in red - sequence galaxies , for example triggered by mergers , may reduce the color evolution .",
    "@xcite suggest that quenched galaxies may undergo a second starburst due to gas accretion .",
    "this starburst moves the galaxies back to the blue cloud .",
    "once the star formation is quenched for the second time , the galaxy moves again to the red sequence .",
    "compared to just passive evolution , the galaxy will be bluer due to younger ages of the newly formed stars . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite find that episodic star forming models provide the best explanation of the evolution of the blue sequence .",
    "also , low - level residual star formation  or `` frosting '' of younger stars to an older `` base '' population  may depress the color evolution and could explain the apparently too blue colors of the low - redshift red - sequence galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , only @xmath715% of the low - redshift field ellipticals show evidence for fairly recent star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus this effect can not fully explain the slow color evolution .",
    "an evolving imf or metallicity may also alter the rest - frame @xmath2 evolution of the red sequence .",
    "for example , in case metallicity is lower for galaxies that form or quench at later times , @xmath113 will be slower .",
    "furthermore , several authors have suggested that the imf of massive elliptical galaxies may be top - heavy or `` bottom light '' ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . such imfs lead to slower color evolution than salpeter - like imfs @xcite , although the effect is relatively small @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the used stellar population models @xcite might be incomplete , and the evolution in the models may be too strong .",
    "our recent discovery of galaxies with quiescent stellar populations beyond @xmath1 suggests that a red sequence is already in place at these redshifts .",
    "we examined this suggestion using our nir spectroscopic survey of massive galaxies at @xmath123 .",
    "the combination of spectroscopic redshifts and detailed continuum shapes as provided by the nir spectra , allows the first accurate rest - frame color and stellar mass determinations for a massive galaxy sample beyond @xmath1 .",
    "the distribution of galaxies in the rest - frame @xmath2 color versus mass diagram demonstrates the existence of a red sequence at @xmath0 , with a significance of @xmath4 .",
    "the red sequence hosts @xmath5% of the stellar mass at the high mass end ( @xmath62 ) at @xmath0 .",
    "we study the stellar populations of the red - sequence galaxies using emission line diagnostics , and stellar population modeling .",
    "the stellar continua , as provided by the nir spectra , of nearly all red - sequence galaxies are best - fit by specific sfrs less than 0.05 gyr@xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the blue galaxies , they have no detected rest - frame optical emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath60 ) , or the line emission is dominated by agn activity .",
    "thus , both independent diagnostics imply that the red sequence is dominated by galaxies with quiescent stellar populations .    by combining rest - frame @xmath2 with @xmath6 , we find that the @xmath0 red - sequence galaxies are in a post - starburst phase , with typical ages of @xmath124 gyr .",
    "this finding is supported by the strong balmer break in the stacked spectrum of all red - sequence galaxies .",
    "overall , this implies that the red sequence is primarily driven by post - starburst galaxies at this epoch , and probably has just started to build up at @xmath0 .",
    "we study the rest - frame @xmath2 color evolution of massive galaxies by comparing our sample with spectroscopic galaxy samples at @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "remarkably , rest - frame @xmath2 evolves slowly , by only @xmath125 mag between @xmath0 and the present . the fraction of massive galaxies ( @xmath62 ) on the red sequence increases by only @xmath89% between @xmath0 and @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , the fraction of the total stellar mass of massive galaxies on the red - sequence increases by only @xmath91% .",
    "however , the number and mass density of the massive ( @xmath62 ) red - sequence galaxies grow by factors of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , over the same redshift interval .    overall",
    ", we show that the slow color evolution of the red sequence does not allow a straightforward explanation .",
    "simple aging models predict a too strong color evolution , and consequently the red - sequence galaxies are too red at @xmath126 .",
    "also , such models can not reproduce the strong density evolution of galaxies on the red sequence that we measure here . presumably , the evolution is a combination of aging , galaxy transformations and red mergers .",
    "furthermore , frosting of young stars , recent starbursts , dust , and an evolving imf may also play a minor role in the evolution of the red sequence , but this remains to be explored .",
    "more accurate constraints from the color evolution require independent measurements of the metallicity , dust content , ages , current sfrs , and imf of red - sequence galaxies over all epochs . as for the moment",
    ", the evolution of the number density and mass function provide the most powerful method to study the growth of the red sequence .",
    "the slope and spread ( @xmath127 ) can also be used to set further constraints on its build - up . however , due to the significant errors on the rest - frame colors and the small size of the @xmath0 spectroscopic sample , we use neither in this work .",
    "we do note that none of the models discussed here violate the constraints imposed by the observed scatter .",
    "finally , we would like to note that our findings are supported by recent morphological studies .",
    "using follow up high - resolution nic2 imaging on _ hst _ and adaptive optics imaging with nirc2 on keck , @xcite find very compact sizes and extremely high inferred stellar mass densities for the red - sequence galaxies in this paper ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this finding implies that these galaxies do not passively evolve into the red - sequence galaxies in the local universe .",
    "thus , both the morphological and color evolution require active evolution to take place that transform the @xmath0 red - sequence galaxies to those at the current epoch .",

    "<S> their strong balmer breaks and their location in the rest - frame @xmath2,@xmath6 plane indicate that they are in a post - starburst phase , with typical ages of @xmath70.5 - 1.0gyr . in order to study the evolution of the red sequence , we compare our sample with spectroscopic massive galaxy samples at @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the rest - frame @xmath2 color reddens by @xmath10 mag from @xmath0 to the present at a given mass . over the same redshift interval , </S>",
    "<S> the number and stellar mass density on the high - mass end ( @xmath11 ) of the red sequence grow by factors of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we explore simple models to explain the observed evolution . </S>",
    "<S> passive evolution models predict too strong @xmath14 , and produce @xmath15 galaxies that are too red . </S>",
    "<S> more complicated models that include aging , galaxy transformations , and red mergers can explain both the number density and color evolution of the massive end of the red sequence between @xmath0 and the present . </S>"
