    "s one of the major concerns of cosmology is the dark energy .",
    "recent cosmological observations @xcite suggest that our universe is ( approximately ) spatially flat and its cosmic inflation is due to the matter field ( dark energy ) having negative pressure ( violating energy conditions ) .",
    "the composition of universe density is the following : 74% dark energy ( de ) , 22% dark matter and 4% ordinary matter @xcite .",
    "though there is a compelling evidence that expansion of the universe is accelerating , yet the nature of dark energy has been under consideration since the last decade @xcite-@xcite .",
    "several models have been proposed for this purpose , e.g. , chaplygin gas , phantoms , quintessence , cosmological constant and dark energy in brane worlds . however",
    ", none of these models can be regarded as being entirely convincing so far .",
    "the cosmological constant , @xmath2 is the most obvious theoretical candidate of de which has the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath3 .",
    "astronomical observations indicate that the cosmological constant is many orders of magnitude smaller than estimated in modern theories of elementary particles @xcite .",

    "one can observe that magnetic field may increase anisotropic behavior of the de since it contributes to @xmath57 which decreases with the increase in time and it tends to zero as @xmath157 .",
