    "interstellar scintillation ( iss ) is the apparent variation in flux density of very compact radio sources due to propagation through the irregular refractive index of the ionized interstellar medium .",
    "the phenomenon was discovered and investigated through its 100% variations in pulsar signals seen on time scales from minutes to days .",
    "most extragalactic radio sources have angular diameters much too large to scintillate , in the same way that the angular size of planets suppresses their atmospheric twinkling .",
    "however , the most compact parts of some active galactic nuclei do fluctuate at a level of 110% over times shorter than a few days in a phenomenon called intraday variation ( idv ) ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although this was initially thought to be intrinsic variation of the sources interpreted as due to emission from regions with brightness temperatures very much higher than the inverse compton limit , it was subsequently explained as iss somewhere within the 1  kpc thick layer of the `` warm ionized medium '' ( wim ) of our galaxy , and implied maximum source brightness temperatures near the inverse compton limit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , among intraday variables , a few sources stand out as having unusually fast high - amplitude variations at frequencies of 38  ghz . with time scales less than a few hours , they have been called `` intrahour variables '' ( ihv ) , the best studied of which are b1257326 , b1519273 , and j1819 + 385 .",
    "their short time scales can only be explained by scintillation in a local region whose electron density has much greater root - mean - squared variation than in the general wim .",
    "the distances to the scattering are estimated to be in the range 130  pc . however , until now no specific site in the local ism has been identified as responsible .",
    "a common feature of the ihv observations is that there is a systematic annual variation in their time scales due to a changing velocity of the earth relative to the interstellar - scattering medium .",
    "indeed several observers have estimated the characteristic transverse velocities of the medium relative to the sun needed to fit the iss observations @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting that only a very few sources varied on hourly time scales in the 5  ghz vla survey of 525 compact flat - spectrum agns , even though about half of them varied at a low level on times of several days @xcite .",
    "thus the regions responsible for ihv cover a very small fraction of the sky .",
    "the basic goal of this paper is to compare the velocities from the rapid iss sources with the velocities of the warm local interstellar clouds identified by @xcite and so find the regions of the local ism responsible for the ihv .",
    "we find that the turbulence responsible for the scintillation may be generated by cloud - cloud interactions that could also enhance the ionization at cloud interfaces .",
    "the sun is located in a @xmath0100pc radius volume devoid of dense interstellar material known as the local bubble @xcite . within the local bubble",
    ", a group of warm partially ionized clouds is found in the immediate ( @xmath120pc ) vicinity of the sun and is often referred to as the local interstellar medium ( lism ) .",
    "this collection of gas is comprosed of distinct components , or clouds .",
    "this is demonstrated by the fact that lism sight lines often exhibit multiple distinct absorbers , on average @xmath01.7 absorbers per sight line @xcite ; therefore any given line of sight typically has between 1 and 3 components .",
    "in addition , physical characteristics ( e.g. , temperature , metal depletion , etc . ) and cloud kinematics are spatially correlated , that is , individual clouds have unique properties and dynamics .",
    "@xcite used the largest lism observational database , based on high spectral resolution ultraviolet and optical absorption measurements , to investigate the kinematical properties of the closest lism clouds .",
    "they derived three - dimensional velocity vectors for 15 clouds , which all reside within 15pc , including the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) and galactic ( g ) cloud , the two closest clouds , whose dynamics were first calculated by @xcite and @xcite . the 15 velocity vectors are roughly parallel , indicating that they share a common origin or driver , an issue discussed by @xcite .",
    "however , the velocity vectors have a range of velocities ( 050 km  s@xmath2 relative to the local standard of rest ) , which implies that cloud - cloud collisions and interactions will play a prominent role in the physical properties of the lism .",
    "the outer edges of lism clouds are likely sites for interesting phenomena such as scintillation screens .",
    "it is in these regions that the kinematic differences between neighboring clouds are most extreme and the effects of any interaction most prominent .",
    "for example , shearing flows between clouds with just moderately different velocity vectors may induce turbulence in the interaction zone between the clouds .",
    "in addition , the edges of the clouds should have higher ionization levels , as compared to the bulk of the cloud , due to the lack of significant shielding from ionizing radiation sources such as the b - star @xmath3 cma and the hot white dwarfs feige 24 , hz 43 , and g191-b2b @xcite .",
    "these regions are prime locations for enhanced electron density and high levels of turbulence and are therefore ideal sites for local scintillation screens .",
    "the distribution of the 15 dynamical clouds in galactic coordinates is shown in figure 19 of @xcite .",
    "we plot in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] @xmath4 circular regions centered on the three quasars , showing the boundaries of nearby clouds that could be the sites of scattering screens . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , regions where several clouds lie along the line of sight are colored , and the shading is related to the magnitude of the maximum velocity difference between any pair of clouds along that particular sight line . since we know the three - dimensional velocity vector for all 15 clouds , we can decompose the velocity into transverse ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and radial ( @xmath7 ) components . the differential velocity shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ]",
    "is calculated from the differences between two clouds along a line of sight , @xmath8 .",
    "all three scintillation sight lines discussed in this work are also shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] , along with two additional known but less well studied intrahour variables .",
    "note that all are located in regions where multiple clouds are found and the probability of cloud interactions is high .",
    "the differential velocities in these regions are also significant ( @xmath910 km  s@xmath2 and even as high as @xmath045 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the location of the scintillation sight lines is quite suggestive , but a more stringent test of the connection between scintillation screens and the warm lism clouds can be achieved using the recently determined velocity vectors of the lism clouds . the transverse velocity can now be calculated and directly compared to the transverse flow measured toward local scintillation screens . without a velocity vector , the only observable velocity is the radial component .",
    "the velocity components of lism clouds located along or near the three scintillation sight lines studied in this work are listed in table  [ tab : lismvecs ] .",
    "the comparison of scintillation transverse velocities with the transverse velocities of nearby warm lism clouds is the subject of the following sections .",
    "observers have characterized the scintillation in flux density by forming its auto - correlation function and defining a time scale as the time lag where the correlation falls to half of its ( noise - corrected ) value at zero lag .",
    "when this time scale is plotted against day of year , an annual variation can be seen for the ihv sources , see figures  [ fig:1257][fig:1819 ] .",
    "the ihv itself and the annual variation of its time scale are produced by the earth s motion relative to the scintillation pattern of focused and defocused waves produced by the turbulent plasma .",
    "the time scale for interstellar scintillation , @xmath10 , is determined by the characteristic spatial scale of the iss diffraction pattern divided by the _",
    "transverse velocity of the earth relative to the pattern .",
    "two processes cause an annual variation in @xmath10  the changing velocity of the earth relative to the interstellar plasma and the possibility that the diffraction pattern is not statistically circular but is characterized by an ellipse with axial ratio @xmath11 , geometric mean spatial scale @xmath12 , and orientation angle of the major axis @xmath13 with respect to east ( through north ) .",
    "the noncircular diffraction pattern could be produced either by an anisotropic source structure or by anisotropic scattering .",
    "thus both the effective pattern scale and velocity vary as the earth orbits the sun .",
    "_    the algebraic details are as follows .",
    "if @xmath14 is the velocity of the earth relative to the sun on a given day and @xmath15 is the ( unknown ) velocity of the interstellar plasma relative to the sun , we write ra and dec components of the earth s transverse velocity relative to the interstellar plasma ( and to the scintillation pattern ) as : @xmath16 taking the spatial correlation function of the intensity scintillation to be a simple function of a quadratic form in orthogonal transverse coordinates , the resulting iss time scale is : @xmath17 where for the ellipse specified as above , the coefficients of the quadratic form are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath12 is the geometric mean spatial scale on which the intensity correlation falls to 1/e . equation ( [ eq : tiss ] ) is mathematically the same as equation ( 3 ) of @xcite .",
    "the radio observations are typically a set of @xmath10 versus date measurements , as shown by the points in the left hand panels of figures [ fig:1257 ] , [ fig:1519 ] and [ fig:1819 ] .",
    "the fitting task is to find the three iss parameters ( @xmath11 , @xmath13 , @xmath12 ) and the two plasma velocities ( @xmath21 ) that give the best fit using this model equation .",
    "it can be shown that there are five independent coefficients in the general case , but that the five physical parameters depend nonlinearly on the @xmath10 data and so can not be estimated independently .",
    "thus , while we fitted for the best of these five parameters , we also investigated the error surface by stepping through a grid of values for ( @xmath21 ) and at each step fitting for the remaining three iss parameters ; we constrained the axial ratio to be less than 10 , since the fit becomes degenerate for very large axial ratios , in a fashion similar to that used by @xcite .",
    "the right hand panels of the same figures show that for all three sources there is a satisfactory fit in an extended valley in ism velocity space .",
    "pks b1257326 is a flat spectrum , radio - loud quasar at @xmath23 that exhibits ihv at frequencies of several ghz @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:1257 ] ( left ) shows the iss time scales for pks b1257326 observed on different days in 20002003 at 4.8 ghz by @xcite ( kindly provided by dr .",
    "hayley bignall ) .",
    "the contours in the right panel show the range in transverse velocities that lead to fits with reduced @xmath24 . with 26 observations and fitting for three parameters ,",
    "the good fits correspond to @xmath25 . in their analysis of the same time scale data but also including the iss time delays between two widely separated radio telescopes , @xcite found a best combined fit at velocities @xmath26  km  s@xmath2  and @xmath27  km  s@xmath2 , where the axial ratio was constrained to be less than 12.0 .",
    "they concluded that the scintillation pattern is highly elongated with an axial ratio @xmath28 , and the scattering screen is located within 10  pc of the earth .",
    "we also find large axial ratios for the iss pattern .",
    "also plotted in the figure are the transverse velocities of the five nearby clouds located close to the line of sight to the quasar .",
    "the transverse velocities for two clouds ( aur and gem ) give very good fits , and the gem cloud has a velocity very close to the best unconstrained five - parameter fit , @xmath29  km  s@xmath2  and @xmath30  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the iss parameters for this fit are @xmath31 , with values that vary systematically along the band of good fits in velocity space .",
    "note also that there is a small isolated region centered on @xmath32  km  s@xmath2  and @xmath33  km  s@xmath2  with nearly the same minimum @xmath34 that is far from any cloud velocities .",
    "the diamond symbol indicates the transverse velocity obtained by @xcite , which is well outside the error bounds for the cloud velocities .",
    "they point out that the large anisotropy of the scintillation pattern permits a range of best fit velocities that lie along a straight line in the ( @xmath35 ) plane .",
    "this line is situated along the best fit line in figure  3(right ) .",
    "their best fit value of @xmath26 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath27 km  s@xmath2 is therefore poorly constrained .",
    "however , it is remarkable that four of the five clouds have transverse velocities in the band of velocities that provide `` reasonable '' fits to the iss data .",
    "we show the time scale fit for the closest - fitting gem cloud by the dashed line in the left panel of the figure .",
    "the clouds in this group are located within @xmath36  km  s@xmath2  of each other , suggesting a real physical association between these clouds and the plasma producing the scintillation .",
    "although the best fits ( lowest @xmath34 ) in figure  [ fig:1257 ] are for both the aur and gem clouds , the line of sight to the quasar passes through the edge of the gem cloud but is about @xmath37 outside of the aur cloud ( figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "for this reason , we believe that the scintillation screen lies at the edge of the gem cloud , which lies within 6.7  pc of the sun @xcite .",
    "the orientation of the edge of the gem cloud in celestial coordinates is about @xmath38 compared to @xmath39 .",
    "the 5 and 8  ghz time scale data from @xcite in the left panel of figure [ fig:1519 ] are overplotted as in their figure 1 .",
    "these data are not as extensive as for the other two sources , and there are no errors given for the time scales .",
    "since the data do not show a consistent difference in time scale between the two frequencies , we fit the two data sets simultaneously .",
    "the right panel ( same format as for b1257326 ) shows the contours that define a good fit and the error ellipses for the four clouds near that line of sight .",
    "both the g and leo clouds give good fits , lying within the @xmath40 contour .",
    "we note that in the absence of error bars for the time scales , the estimate of @xmath34 is based on the goodness of fit , so that its normalization is not reliable .",
    "the time scale model for the g cloud is overplotted in the left panel together with the best five parameter fit ",
    "km  s@xmath2 , @xmath42  km  s@xmath2",
    ". the iss parameters for this fit are @xmath43 .",
    "we note that these velocities are distinct from that of the local standard of rest used by @xcite in their analysis of the same time scale data .",
    "we conclude that the scintillation screen lies near the edge of the g cloud , since the leo cloud lies about @xmath44 from the source ( figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the inner edge of the g cloud lies closer than 1.3  pc from the sun and may extend several parsecs away from the inner edge .",
    "the orientation of the g cloud edge in celestial coordinates is about @xmath45 compared to @xmath46 .",
    "figure [ fig:1819 ] ( left ) shows the excellent 5  ghz iss data overplotted from the years 19992001 for the quasar j1819 + 385 observed by @xcite .",
    "this source shows the largest intraday variability presently known at radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the best five parameter fit to these data is for @xmath47  km  s@xmath2  and @xmath48  km  s@xmath2 , which is within the uncertainty of the mic cloud velocity .",
    "the right panel shows the narrow band in transverse velocity space corresponding to fits to the iss data with reduced @xmath49 .",
    "the transverse velocities of the mic and lic clouds are the best fits to the iss data , although the g and oph clouds provide fits with reduced @xmath50 . again",
    ", four of the six clouds have transverse velocities that give good - to - reasonable fits to the iss data .",
    "the transverse velocity of the local standard of rest is an unacceptable fit to the data , as already reported by @xcite .",
    "our analysis , which follows that of @xcite , agrees with their result that the iss data lie in a narrow region of velocity space , as shown in figure [ fig:1819 ] ( right ) . by combining their time scale data with time delay data on an intercontinental baseline",
    ", they arrived at a best fit for @xmath51  km  s@xmath2  and @xmath52  km  s@xmath2   relative to the local standard of rest .",
    "this is plotted with the diamond symbol in the heliocentric reference system that we use in this paper .",
    "their result is well removed from the values for the local clouds , but as stated in a footnote in their paper , @xcite used an algorithm for interpreting the time delay data that was not corrected for anisotropic scintillation .",
    "we therefore make no further use of that value plotted by the diamond .",
    "their figures 10 and 11 give results for fitting to the annual changes in time scale that yield an axial ratio @xmath53 oriented at @xmath54 this is consistent with our result , which gives a best fit at @xmath55 .",
    "they also conclude that the thin - scattering screen is located only 112 pc from the sun .",
    "the line of sight to the quasar lies well inside the lic and close to the edge of the mic cloud , the best fits in figure  [ fig:1819 ] .",
    "it also lies close to the edge of the g cloud but some @xmath56 outside of the oph cloud .",
    "we believe that the most likely candidate cloud for the scintillation source is the mic cloud since @xcite show that this cloud appears to be compressed by the lic and g clouds , and the mic cloud has the highest temperature ( @xmath57  k ) of the 15 clouds they studied .",
    "the mic cloud lies within 5.1  pc of the sun .",
    "the orientation of the mic cloud edge in celestial coordinates is about @xmath4 compared to @xmath58 .",
    "we have fit the iss time scale observations of the three quasars that show the largest amplitude intraday variations and have high quality data sets . for each quasar ,",
    "our search of a large range of possible transverse velocities of the scintillation screen yielded good agreement with the annular variation of the iss data for a relatively narrow range of transverse velocities . for each quasar",
    "there are at least two warm interstellar clouds that have transverse velocities consistent with the acceptable range ( reduced @xmath59 ) , but we propose that the scattering screen is located in one of the clouds near its edge .",
    "the transverse velocity of the local standard of rest , the usual assumption in previous studies , is an unacceptable solution for all three quasars .    in all cases ,",
    "the scintillation screen is asymmetrical .",
    "we compared the ellipse orientations @xmath60 with the orientations of the nearest cloud edge to see whether the turbulence structure is elongated parallel to the cloud edge , perhaps by a magnetic field confining the outside of the cloud .",
    "we found no preferred alignments as the ellipse orientations differ typically by @xmath61 to @xmath62 from the orientation of the edge of the cloud that we believe is the location of the scattering screen .",
    "this apparent misalignment may indicate that the cloud edges have complex geometries that our coarse fitting to a modest number of lines of sight can not reveal .",
    "also @xcite and @xcite show that the turbulent regions producing the observed scintillation are likely very small on the basis of the arrival times of pulses from the millisecond pulsar b1937 + 21 and other arguments .",
    "previous authors have placed the locations of the scattering screens near to the sun on the basis of the scintillation time scales and the time delays between the scintillation flux variations as seen by two widely separated radio telescopes .",
    "our analysis confirms and places more stringent constraints on the distances to the scattering screens .",
    "for example , @xcite place the scattering screen toward b1257326 within 10  pc of the sun , and we argue that it is located within 6.7  pc .",
    "@xcite argue that the scattering screen for j1819 + 385 is located between 1 and 12  pc from the sun , and @xcite present two models that fit their data with the scattering screen located at @xmath63  pc or @xmath64  pc .",
    "we argue that the screen toward this source is located at the edge of the mic cloud within 5.1  pc of the sun .",
    "if the mic cloud is indeed compressed and heated by the lic and g clouds , then the scattering screen in the mic cloud is located much closer to the sun than 5.1  pc .",
    "the scattering screen toward b1519273 near the edge of the g cloud is likely closer than 3  pc from the sun .",
    "an important result is that for each source , the line of sight to the quasar passes through or very near to at least two warm clouds .",
    "although we know only upper limits to the distances to most of these clouds , they are all nearby and could interact . for example , interaction of the lic and g clouds is likely responsible for the shape and high temperature of the mic cloud . since typical velocity differences between clouds along the three lines of sight",
    "are 1020  km  s@xmath2 , the interactions could easily produce turbulence that would be responsible for the scintillation .",
    "also , cloud edges are regions of high ionization because of the absence of shielding from the strong uv radiation from hot stars and white dwarfs .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows areas on the sky where the velocity differences between clouds along the line of sight are large and where cloud - cloud interactions could produce turbulence .",
    "we predict that these are regions where large amplitude idv sources will be discovered .",
    "two examples that deserve further study are the two idv sources located in the southern hemisphere ( pks 0405385 and psr j04374715 ) that are plotted in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] but are not analyzed in this paper as high quality iss data are not yet published .",
