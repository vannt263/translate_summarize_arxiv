    "in recent papers two of us have studied the thermodynamics and the optical conductivity of unconventional spin density wave ( usdw ) and unconventional charge density wave ( ucdw ) @xcite . unlike conventional sdw or cdw",
    ", we define usdw and ucdw as the sdw and cdw where the order parameter @xmath1 depends on the quasi - particle momentum @xmath2 . as to the initial motivation",
    ", the presence of many unconventional superconductors is an adequate justification @xcite . indeed",
    "the thermodynamics of usdw or ucdw are identical to the one of d - wave superconductor @xcite .    on the other hand the low temperature phase ( ltp ) of @xmath0 has not been understood until now .",
    "the ltp does not exhibit x - ray or nmr signals characteristic to conventional cdw or sdw @xcite , and this property is naturally born out by the udw model @xcite .",
    "the response of the ltp in a magnetic field suggests that it is not sdw but more likely a kind of cdw @xcite .",
    "indeed the phase diagram of the ltp in a magnetic field is rather similar to the one of a d - wave superconductor in the presence of the pauli paramagnetism @xcite .    in the presence of magnetic field (",
    "say parallel to the conduction chain in order to avoid the orbital effect ) the ltp splits into two regimes : the low field regime , where @xmath3 is constant spatially and the high field regime where @xmath3 varies periodically in space @xcite . in superconductors the latter regime",
    "is called fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinikov ( fflo ) state @xcite .",
    "very recently the threshold electric field associated with the sliding motion of cdw or sdw of @xmath0 has been reported @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the threshold electric field is very different from the ones we know for conventional cdw like @xmath4 and conventional sdw like @xmath5 , though somewhat closer to the one in sdw @xcite .",
    "we have shown recently @xcite that udw ( either charge or spin ) gives the temperature dependent threshold electric field , which is very close to the observation . though the agreement is not perfect , we believe that the discrepancy is due to imperfect nesting what we neglected for simplicity .",
    "the object of the present paper is to extend the earlier analysis in the presence of a magnetic field . as in earlier works @xciteon",
    "the related subjects we focus on the zeeman splitting ( or the pauli paramagnetic effect ) due to the external magnetic field . also for simplicity we limit ourselves to the regime where @xmath3 is spatially uniform . then the related thermodynamic quantities have been worked out already in @xcite . therefore the model used in @xcite can be readily extended .",
    "we find that the threshold electric field depends on the external magnetic field as well as on the temperature .",
    "therefore we believe that the predicted field dependence should be readily accessible experimentally .",
    "the @xmath6 salts can be put into two groups : one superconducting and another with this mysterious ltp .",
    "@xmath7 with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 belong to the second group .",
    "hence we suggest that our theory applies to the ltp in the second group .",
    "the phase diagram is the same as the one in a d - wave superconductor @xcite without the fflo state . at @xmath11",
    "a first order transition occurs to the normal state at @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the zero field zero temperature order parameter and @xmath14 .",
    "the value of the gap is @xmath15 at the transition point . with decreasing field , the transition occurs at @xmath16 , and the gap jumps from zero to @xmath17 . for @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the transition temperature at @xmath20 ) the transition remains first order , and hysteresis is observable somewhere between @xmath21 . in this region ,",
    "the normal state becomes local minimum of the free energy , and depending on the direction of the change of the external field , the first order transition occurs at smaller field approaching from the normal state than quitting the dw phase with increasing field . by exceeding @xmath22 ,",
    "the transition becomes second order at the bicritical point ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the phase diagram is modified at @xmath18 and @xmath25 because of the possibility of the fflo regime what we excluded here for simplicity .",
    "the order parameter as a function of @xmath26 and @xmath27 is shown in fig .",

    "for @xmath65 , along the second order phase boundary the threshold field reads as @xmath66 which is divergent at the bicritical point ( possibly tricritical with the fflo state ) due to the zero of @xmath67 at @xmath68 . as a result",
