    "quantum impurity problems have attracted constant attention recently .",
    "the reason is , that the underlying physics is highly non trivial , that the models are manageable technically despite the presence of very strong interactions , and that there are many practical / experimental applications .",
    "the latter include the kondo effect , quantum dots , dissipative quantum mechanics , impurity tunneling in fractional quantum hall devices and in one dimensional quantum wires .",
    "the physical variables are usually the temperature , the external field , the bulk interactions , the nature of the impurity ( which can either be a charge or spin impurity ) , and the way it is coupled to the bulk degrees of freedom",
    ". a standard approach to computing physical quantities in these models would be to use perturbation theory in the bulk - impurity coupling for example .",
    "this perturbative expansion is most of the time done around the uv fixed point , and usually leads to limited results .",
    "since all the problems of interest are essentially one dimensional ( or can be reformulated as such ) , more powerful methods can however be used .",
    "for instance , in recent years , a conformal field theory description has allowed a much better understanding of the fixed points and their vicinity @xcite .",
    "another method , which is a priori less general , is the use of quantum integrability , pioneered in the study of the kondo problem @xcite .",
    "integrability is a powerful , non perturbative tool , which is not limited to the vicinity of the fixed points but allows a complete description of the properties all the way along the renormalisation group flow , from the uv to the ir fixed points .",
    "technical difficulties have for a long time restricted the use of integrability to the computation of thermodynamic , equilibrium properties .",
    "however , recent progress , in particular in the understanding of form factors @xcite and integrable description of conformal field theories @xcite , have also made possible the computation of dynamical , out of equilibrium properties for many quantum impurity problems @xcite .",
    "a still open challenge in that field is the problem of a single ( charge ) impurity in a one dimensional quantum wire , where the electrons are described by a luttinger liquid with charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "this problem was studied using the renormalisation group and perturbation theory by kane and fisher @xcite and furusaki and nagaosa @xcite . there , a complete picture of the flows generated by the rg was obtained in terms of the  @xmath3 \" factors , @xmath1 and @xmath4 , describing the interaction of bulk charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the existence of tentalizing new fixed points , which would be partly transmitting and partly reflecting , was in particular conjectured .",
    "steps were taken to identify these fixed points using conformal field theory @xcite , but the problem remains open .    in this paper , we are addressing this impurity problem from the point of view of integrability .",
    "the case of an impurity in a spinless electron gas could be mapped on the boundary sine - gordon model @xcite , which is a completely integrable quantum field theory @xcite , formally analogous to the anisotropic kondo problem , but with the impurity spin in a cyclic representation of the quantum algebra @xmath2 @xcite . here",
    ", we show that the case of electrons with spin maps , when @xmath0 , onto a model analogous to the anisotropic two channel kondo model , again with the impurity spin chosen in a cyclic representation of the quantum algebra @xmath2 .",
    "this allows us to compute the relevant physical properties .",
    "in order to fix notations , let us repeat some of the basic definitions in @xcite . in the one dimensional luttinger liquid , bosonisation of the fermionic operators",
    "is accomplished via @xmath6 } e^{i\\sqrt{\\pi } \\phi_\\mu(x)},\\ ] ] with @xmath7 .",
    "the fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 have commutation relations @xmath10=i \\delta_{\\mu , \\mu ' } \\theta(x - x')\\ ] ] from which we can devise two different representations of the luttinger liquid ( our conventions follow @xcite ) . here",
    ", we will work in the so called @xmath11-representation .",
    "changing basis to the charge and spin degrees of freedom @xmath12 we obtain the action @xmath13 + \\frac{1}{2g_\\sigma } [ ( \\partial_x\\theta_\\sigma)^2 + ( \\partial_y\\theta_\\sigma)^2 ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the imaginary time , the spin and charge velocities have been normalised such that @xmath15 . in this convention ,",
    "the g - factors have value @xmath16 for a non - interacting system .",
    "the case of quantum wires with @xmath17 symmetry corresponds to @xmath0 .",
    "the electric and magnetic conductances of this system follow directly from kubo s formula @xmath18 as discussed in @xcite , this formula might not always be physically relevant , because of the coupling to the reservoirs .",
    "it has been proposed that @xmath19 might always hold , whatever the interactions in the quantum wire .",
    "of course , this does not mean that the scattering through the impurity will be trivial in that case ; it will indeed , still be controlled by the action written above , the only difference being in the meaning of the `` applied voltage '' . here ,",
    "we will simply follow @xcite for uniformity of notations . physical results for different reservoirs configurations can be recovered by rescaling the voltage .    in the presence of a charge impurity at the origin @xmath20",
    ", the hamiltonian gets an additional piece @xmath21 here @xmath22 is a potential which has essentially zero measure outside @xmath20 . under the bosonisation rules sketched at the beginning ,",
    "this leads to the change of action @xmath23 where @xmath24 . in the physical case",
    ", there is no apparent symmetry that allows us to restrict to the action ( [ chagact ] ) - the most general form of the perturbation is @xmath25 where the @xmath26 s are real couplings .",
    "the renormalisation group equations read at first order @xmath27 as mentioned before , in this paper we restrict to the case @xmath0 , which is the one relevant for physical quantum wires with unbroken @xmath17 spin symmetry . then , beside the perturbation with @xmath28 , the operators @xmath29 is relevant for @xmath30 .",
    "the operator with @xmath31 is always irrelevant .",
    "we will thus further restrict in the following to the ( probably not physically relevant ) case where only @xmath32 or the case where @xmath33 , so we have to take into account the term @xmath34 only , which we simply call @xmath26 in what follows .    in @xcite , the equivalent problem for spinless electrons was exactly solved .",
    "the solution required a folding to transform the impurity problem into a boundary problem , and then used recent results on boundary integrable quantum field theories @xcite together with the massless scattering approach .",
    "the same folding can easily be accomplished in the problem with spin .",
    "first , it is convenient to rescale the fields , writing the action as @xmath35.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then introduce odd and even fields @xmath36 \\\\ \\theta^o_\\mu&=&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } [ \\theta_{\\mu , l}(x , y ) -\\theta_{\\mu , r } ( -x , y ) ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with this , the interaction at @xmath20 involves only the even fields which have neumann boundary conditions .",
    "the odd fields , having dirichlet boundary conditions , completely decouple and do not interact . also , the even field , as defined above , is left moving and we can  fold \" using @xmath37 we can now express everything in terms of the fields @xmath38 which is defined on the negative axis , the action becomes @xmath39+\\lambda \\int dy \\cos\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi g_\\rho}{2 } } \\theta_\\rho ( 0 ) \\cos\\sqrt{\\pi } \\theta_\\sigma ( 0 ) .",
    "\\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the next step in @xcite was to use the integrability of the corresponding boundary quantum field theory - the boundary sine - gordon model ( bsg ) .",
    "in the present case with spin , the problem , involving two fields , is a priori more complicated .",
    "indeed it is unlikely that the problem is soluble for general values of @xmath40 .",
    "however , in the case @xmath0 , the problem can be solved , as we now demonstrate .",
    "the trick to solve a boundary problem such as the one under consideration here , is to introduce a more general integrable problem with both bulk and boundary perturbations .",
    "the bulk term is chosen such that the theory remains integrable thus defining a basis of quasiparticles bulk excitations .",
    "these excitations are interacting through an elastic , two particles @xmath5 matrix derived from the constraints of unitarity , crossing - symmetry and the yang - baxter equation @xcite .",
    "since the theory with boundary is also integrable , there are also strong constraints on the boundary reflection matrix @xmath41 leading to a very simple scattering of these quasiparticles at the boundary .",
    "when one lets the bulk coupling go to zero , these become massless quasiparticles which scatter in a simple way at the boundary .",
    "taking the massless limit is by now a standard procedure and has been discussed in @xcite .    in our case",
    ", we need to find the appropriate bulk perturbation for the problem .",
    "the first natural idea to handle ( [ bdaction ] ) is to introduce as a bulk perturbation @xmath42 note the doubling of the cosine s arguments compared with ( [ bdaction ] ) : this is because , quite generally , an integrable perturbation of the form @xmath43 corresponds to an integrable perturbation @xmath44 at the boundary . here",
    "the function @xmath45 is an exponential ( to make the action real , appropriate combinations of exponentials were taken ) , and , using neumann boundary conditions , we wrote @xmath46 .",
    "the problem ( [ firstpert ] ) is however not integrable for generic values of @xmath1 ( integrable sub - varieties have been identified in @xcite and will be the subject of a sequel to this paper ) , so this approach is not satisfactory .",
    "fortunately , we can introduce another bulk perturbation , @xmath47 this corresponds to the function @xmath45 being a cosine function .",
    "this problem is actually well known to be integrable . to see this",
    ", we can refermionize the @xmath48 part .",
    "the term @xmath49 being the sum of a an exponential and its conjugate becomes now a * majorana * fermion , so we have , equivalently , @xmath50 while the free part can be written as a free bosonic hamiltonian , plus the sum of two decoupled free majorana fermions , only one of them appearing into the perturbation @xmath51 + \\psi\\bar{\\partial}\\psi-\\bar{\\psi}\\partial \\bar{\\psi}+\\chi\\bar{\\partial}\\chi-\\bar{\\chi}\\partial\\bar{\\chi}.\\ ] ] factoring out the other fermion ( @xmath52 ) , we end up with a standard integrable @xmath53 analog of the sine - gordon model @xcite .",
    "the boundary perturbation is also integrable . in terms of fermions , it can be written as @xmath54a(y)+{1\\over 2}\\int dy \\left [ \\psi\\bar{\\psi}(0)+a\\dot{a}\\right].\\ ] ] the last part simply enforces appropriate uv boundary conditions .",
    "the quantum operator @xmath55 anticommutes with the fermions , and satisfies @xmath56 ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of bosonization in the presence of a boundary ) .    in the bulk , the theory can be shown to be integrable by exhibiting a set of non - local conserved currents @xmath57 these currents in turn define conserved charges with @xmath58 commutation relations .",
    "they commute with the charges constructed from the following local currents @xmath59 which are also conserved by the perturbation . requiring that these symmetries are realized on the asymptotic states of the theory leads to a bulk @xmath5 matrix factorized into a a @xmath58 , sine - gordon type part describing the scattering of a doublet , @xmath60 , and a supersymmetric part , which is basically a kink @xmath5 matrix with 3 vacua @xcite .",
    "it must be mentioned here that there are some subtle issues regarding the integrability of the previous field theory - for simplicity we discuss only the bulk case here , the boundary case being quite similar .",
    "although naive power counting following the arguments of @xcite suggests that the theory is integrable at any order , the fact that the fermions have integer dimension makes the problem more complicated .",
    "it is generally believed that the integrable theory requires an additional term of the form @xmath61 , as can be checked in the semiclassical case @xcite , or by imposing @xmath62 supersymmetry .",
    "the universal properties of the model ( [ goodlook ] ) are the same as the one with this additional coupling .",
    "indeed , consider for instance the computation of the free energy perturbatively .",
    "if @xmath55 is the short distance cut - off , its expansion involves the coupling @xmath63 for every insertion of the first operator , and the coupling @xmath64 for every insertion of the second . for @xmath1 positive ,",
    "the integrals are divergent .",
    "they could either be rendered finite by dimensional regularization ( akin to taking @xmath1 negative ) , or by using the cut - off . in the latter case ,",
    "the divergent part will only contribute to the regular , bulk part ( see eg @xcite ) .",
    "writing the free energy per unit length @xmath65 , letting @xmath66 and @xmath67 such that @xmath68 remains finite , we obtain a function @xmath69 determined fully by insertions of the first operator , not of the second one .",
    "in fact one can avoid the appeal to this discussion of the bulk integrable theory , and @xmath62 supersymmetry , by addressing the problem from the two channel kondo model point of view .",
    "it is well established that the anisotropic kondo problem is integrable for any number of channels and impurity spin ; the case at hand corresponds simply to a particular impurity spin - a cyclic representation of the quantum algebra @xmath2 . in particular , for the anisotropic two channel kondo model , the s - matrix of the excitations in the bulk is precisely the one mentionned above ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "this identification in addition gives the impurity s - matrix immediately - this is discussed in more details in appendix b.    recall that the solution of the massless problem proceeds by first describing the bulk problem in terms of massless relativistic excitations - the limit @xmath67 of the excitations of ( [ goodlook ] ) .",
    "the basic massless particles are then either right or left moving , with dispersion relation @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , and they have a spin quantum number and a kink quantum number .",
    "we denote them by the doublet @xmath73 .",
    "the label @xmath55 denotes one of the 3 possible vacua ; a kink connects adjacent vacua , and is thus designated by a pair of labels ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we use for the kinematic properties of these basic particles the same parametrization , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 has the dimension of a mass , although the theory is massless .    0.4 cm    0.4 cm    the particles have factorized scattering , with trivial @xmath76 scattering .",
    "the ll and rr scattering are described by the bulk s matrix with tensor product structure @xmath77 here @xmath60 is the usual soliton - antisoliton sine - gordon s - matrix , corresponding to the coupling @xmath78 , ie a quantum group symmetry with deformation parameter @xmath79 , where @xmath80 , so the total dimension of the boundary perturbation ( using that @xmath0 ) is @xmath81 .",
    "the kink s - matrix is the well known restricted solid on solid s - matrix for a model with three vacua .",
    "there may also be bound states , depending on the value of @xmath82 .",
    "there are no such bound states if @xmath82 is larger than one . when @xmath82 is smaller than one , there are @xmath83 of them , where @xmath83 is the integer part of @xmath84 .",
    "the integrability of the model with boundary interaction translates into the fact that massless particles are reflected with no particle production , in a way described by a reflection matrix @xmath41 , solution of the boundary yang - baxter equation . by analogy with the higher spin two - channel kondo model",
    "( see appendix b ) , we find @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the reflection matrix of the boundary sine - gordon problem at the foregoing coupling @xmath87 .",
    "it is enough for our purpose to recall the physical amplitudes @xmath88 here @xmath89 is an energy scale related with the coupling @xmath26 by @xmath90 . physical quantities to be discussed below will be expressed in terms of the squares of r - matrix elements , and therefore expand in powers of @xmath91 . on the other hand ,",
    "these quantities expand in powers of the square of the amplitude in front of the leading irrelevant operator determining the approach to the ir fixed point .",
    "if the ir fixed point is approached along @xmath92 , with @xmath93 of dimension @xmath94 , then @xmath95 has dimension @xmath96 .",
    "hence we find @xmath97 or @xmath98 .",
    "following the discussion in @xcite , this indicates that the ir fixed point corresponds to `` disconnected leads '' , as expected in that domain of the parameters .",
    "the whole logic of @xcite can now be implemented . to compute dc properties ,",
    "it is enough to treat the massless particles as free ones from the point of view of impurity scattering , ie use a landauer bttiker type formula .",

    "the simplest case is when @xmath111 .",
    "then , a fermi sea of antisolitons is formed when a voltage is applied .",
    "all the scattering involves these antisolitons only , so the results can simply be derived for any value of @xmath82 .",

    "the density of these quasiparticles @xmath119 the current then follows from a boltzmann equation describing the one by one scattering of these charged excitation on the boundary .",
    "there are @xmath120 such particles in @xmath121 $ ] and the probability that a particle of type @xmath122 is reflected as one of type @xmath123 is @xmath124 .",
    "this leads , following the arguments of @xcite to the current @xmath125 thus if we manage to determine @xmath126 and solve the linear integral equation for @xmath127 we get an exact evaluation for @xmath128 .",

    "this duality is more transparent through the relation @xmath152 in order to make contact with perturbation theory , we need to find the relation between the boundary scale @xmath89 and @xmath26 .",
    "this is done in appendix b using a first order keldysh computation .      to compute the conductance in the case @xmath153 and @xmath82",
    "an integer is difficult .",
    "the reason is , that the bulk scattering is not diagonal in the soliton antisoliton basis , and the tba equations are written , in fact , for quasiparticles with no definite charge .",
    "the transport equation of @xcite becomes then ambiguous to use . in the case without spin ,",
    "it was possible to conjecture a formula , based on limiting cases , that reproduced well numerical results , and later was established using more complicated functional relations .",

    "the case @xmath160 , @xmath83 an integer , belongs to the attractive regime of the sine - gordon part of our scattering , and corresponds to the case with purely diagonal scattering .",
    "it is thus more favorable to study the conductance via the approach of @xcite . however , while the attractive regime of the ordinary sine - gordon model has been much studied , we are not aware of many such studies for the @xmath62 sine - gordon model of interest here . the complete s - matrix was found in @xcite .",
