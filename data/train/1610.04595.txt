    "we often experience traffic jams during rush hours in cities . in urban networks ,",
    "traffic flows are controlled by traffic lights .",
    "ideally , the cycles of the traffic lights should be coordinated in a way that optimizes the travel times in the network or avoids deadlock situations .",
    "the motivation of this work is to explore systematically the optimization of traffic flow , by using a simple transport model . in traffic engineering excluded - volume effect and stochastic fluctuations",
    "are usually not taken into account .",
    "the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) @xcite is a minimal model that includes these features .",
    "the tasep is one of cellular - automaton models with stochastic time evolution , which are systems of interacting particles on lattices . in the tasep , each site of the lattice is either occupied by a particle or empty , and each particle stochastically hops to the right neighboring site , if this target site is empty . undoubtedly the tasep has played a prominent role as a paradigmatic model for describing many driven non - equilibrium systems , especially physics of transport phenomena @xcite . since its introduction for theoretical description of the kinetics of protein synthesis @xcite ,",
    "the tasep has been generalized in many ways , for e.g. describing biological transports , in particular the motion of molecular motors @xcite .",
    "one of the intriguing disciplines which owe much to the tasep is vehicular traffic flow @xcite .",
    "various features of traffic flow have been investigated in the framework of the tasep such as overtaking @xcite , intersection of streets @xcite , flow at junctions @xcite , queuing process @xcite , anticipation effect @xcite , time and spatial headway at intersections @xcite , on - ramp simulation @xcite , pedestrian - vehicles flow @xcite , roundabout @xcite and shortcut @xcite .",
    "models of traffic flow at intersections have been also investigated by other approaches than the tasep , mainly in discrete - time frameworks @xcite .    in order to investigate the effects of traffic lights",
    ", one can introduce time - dependent hopping probabilities in some particular sites of lattice traffic models .",
    "for example in @xcite , discrete - time models were analyzed on regular square lattices and some traffic - light strategies applied to optimize the flow in the system . on a simpler geometry i.e. ring ,",
    "discrete - time models were also employed @xcite and fundamental diagrams ( the curve of flow _ vs _ the density of cars ) were found to become constant when the density is in a certain range .    in this work",
    "we focus on the control of traffic flows on a single main road of city networks , and analyze different strategies to optimize unidirectional flow by signalization .",
    "specifically we use the continuous - time tasep on a ring rather than more sophisticated discrete - time models @xcite , which have been originally introduced for modeling highway traffic .",
    "compared to these traffic models , in the continuous - time tasep the cars velocities fluctuate stronger . in our system , there is a traffic light which controls the conflicting flow of vehicles at each point intersected by a perpendicular street , see fig .",
    "[ fig : illust ] .",
    "the traffic lights are regarded as local defects . as a special case ,",
    "our model includes one of well - known inhomogeneous taseps , which was introduced by janowsky and lebowitz @xcite .",
    "we also remark that similar variants of the tasep were introduced , e.g. @xcite where the tasep with time - dependent exit rate has been investigated and @xcite where one site in the lattice can be blocked or unblocked stochastically for description of conformation changes in filamentous substrate .",
    "this work is organized as follows . we first ( sec .",
    "[ sec : one ] ) analyze the case where there is only one traffic light on the street .",
    "we explore extensively its basic properties , mainly the fundamental diagrams , in various parameter regimes .",
    "we also consider various types of density profiles , according to averaging procedure .",
    "in particular the density profile by sample average _ converges _ to a periodic function in time .",
    "( in appendix , we give a proof of the periodicity of physical quantities . ) on the other hand , we observe a shock in the density profile by time average .",
    "next ( sec .",
    "[ sec : many ] ) we investigate the case where there are more than one traffic light . for simplicity traffic lights",
    "are equidistantly located .",
    "we treat two strategies for defining the difference between the offsets of two adjacent traffic lights : fixed and random ones @xcite .",
    "we examine the current , which depends on the strategies .",
    "we also measure the total waiting time of cars behind traffic lights , and we explore its average and distribution in the two strategies .",
    "it turns out that there is an interrelation between the total waiting time and the current .",

    "the signal is green for @xmath9 unit of time and red for the rest of the cycle , i.e. , @xmath10 .",

    "this would be a reference case in our model , but simulations with finite @xmath0 are also relevant to real traffic .",
    "our traffic light model is very similar to the tasep with a `` blockage '' , which was introduced by janowsky and lebowitz ( jl ) @xcite .",
    "the jl model contains one `` defective '' bond between sites @xmath0 and 1 where a reduced transition rate @xmath36 is independent of time . within the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the fundamental diagram is found to be @xmath37 with the critical density @xmath38 and the maximal current @xmath39 . in particular , for @xmath40 , a shock is localized around the site @xmath41 , which is determined by @xmath42 it separates the density profile into low- and high - density regions ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively ) .",

    "although these time - average fundamental diagrams are qualitatively similar to that of the jl model , the time - periodic rate at the intersection gives interesting phenomena in various types of density profiles .",
    "in particular the temporary density profile nicely reflects formation and relaxation of a queue behind the light , which enables us to optimize the flow by tuning the period of the traffic light .",
    "in contrast to deterministic discrete - time models , even at low densities it is not possible to avoid queueing of cars completely , but the impact of the signal period and system size is significant .",
    "another interesting observation is that the average of the time - periodic profile over one cycle can exhibit a shock in the periodic system .    for the @xmath118-light problem , we measured the total waiting time of cars behind traffic lights , and explored relations to the flow .",
    "we found that , for the low density regime , the distribution of the total waiting time takes various forms depending on the offset parameter @xmath156 of the fixed offset strategy .",
    "moreover the flow and the waiting times are correlated .",
    "when the density becomes larger , the flow and the waiting time can not be controlled by the offset parameters , and the correlation between the flow and the waiting time becomes weaker .",
    "our results refer to the steady state of a periodic system , which we characterized in some details .",
    "we believe that our approach sets a firm ground for the analysis of more sophisticated traffic models as well as in other geometries . the step toward more complex lattices has already been made , for example , at an intersection of two perpendicular segments @xcite or in more complicated networks @xcite . despite the relevance of these studies for city traffic , in these works traffic optimization has been understood as optimization of the flow . for realistic city traffic , however , it is also important to understand how the cars are distributed in the network as well as to optimize traffic flow with respect to the drivers waiting times .",
    "although we addressed these issues in a rather simple geometry , we observed that the density of cars is strongly varying at different sections of the roads .",
    "this observation is of great relevance for city traffic since a queue on a main road may block a whole section of the city network .",
    "here we prove that ( the ensemble average of ) any quantity @xmath221 converges to a periodic function with period @xmath7 , as @xmath222 .",
    "we consider only the single - light problem , but the proof can be generalized to the @xmath118-light problem .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath223 at time @xmath224 is evolved by the master equation in continuous time @xcite @xmath225 where @xmath226 $ ] , and @xmath227 and @xmath228 are transition rate matrices of the taseps with the usual periodic and reflecting boundary conditions , respectively .",
    "the series @xmath229 obeys a discrete - time markov process @xmath230 with the transition probability matrix @xmath231 .",
    "this process has a stationary state @xmath232 , i.e. @xmath233 in the limit @xmath234 , which satisfies @xmath235 . using the notation @xmath236 $ ]",

    "but jumps are allowed only when the signal is green .",
