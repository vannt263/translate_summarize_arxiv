    "what is the main motivation to deal with continuous variables for quantum communication purposes ?",
    "quantum communication schemes rely on state preparation , local unitary transformations , measurements , and classical communication .",
    "in addition , sometimes shared entanglement is part of the protocol . within the framework of quantum optics",
    ", these ingredients can be efficiently implemented when they are applied to the continuous quadrature amplitudes of electromagnetic modes .",
    "for example , the tools for measuring a quadrature with near - unit efficiency or for displacing an optical mode in phase space are provided by homodyne detection and feed - forward techniques , respectively .",
    "continuous - variable entanglement can be efficiently produced using squeezed light and linear optics . in this chapter",
    ", we consider a rather general manifestation of continuous - variable entanglement , namely that between an arbitrary number of parties ( modes ) .",
    "we will see that even those @xmath0-party entangled states where none of the @xmath0 parties can be separated from the others in the total state vector are comparatively `` cheap '' in terms of the resources needed : their generation only requires one single - mode squeezed state and @xmath1 beam splitters .",
    "the main subject of this section is multi - party entanglement of infinite - dimensional states described by continuous variables .",
    "after a few general remarks on entanglement between two and more parties in arbitrary dimensions , we will show how the quantum circuits for creating and measuring qubit entanglement may be translated to continuous variables .",
    "then we derive inequalities that may serve as sufficient multi - party inseparability criteria for continuous - variable states .",
    "these are applicable both for a theoretical test and for an indirect experimental verification of multi - party entanglement . finally , we focus on a family of genuinely multi - party entangled continuous - variable states whose members are fully inseparable with respect to all their parties .",
    "* bipartite entanglement * , the entanglement of a pair of systems shared by two parties , is easy to handle for * pure states*. for any pure two - party state , orthonormal bases of each subsystem exist , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , so that the total state vector can be written in the `` schmidt decomposition '' @xcite as @xmath4 are real and non - negative , and satisfy @xmath5 .",
    "the schmidt decomposition may be obtained by transforming the expansion of an arbitrary pure bipartite state as @xmath6 with @xmath7 . in the first step",
    ", the matrix @xmath8 with complex elements @xmath9 is diagonalised , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are unitary matrices and @xmath13 is a diagonal matrix with non - negative elements . in the second step",
    ", we defined @xmath14 and @xmath15 which form orthonormal sets due to the unitarity of @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the orthonormality of @xmath16 and @xmath17 . a pure state of two @xmath18-level systems ( `` qudits '' ) is now maximally entangled when the schmidt coefficients of its total state vector are all equal . since the eigenvalues of the reduced density operator upon tracing out one half of a bipartite state are the schmidt coefficients squared , @xmath19 .",
    "a pure two - party state is factorizable ( not entangled ) if and only if the number of nonzero schmidt coefficients is one .",
    "any schmidt number greater than one indicates entanglement .",
    "thus , the `` majority '' of pure state vectors in the hilbert space of two parties are nonmaximally entangled .",
    "furthermore , any pure two - party state is entangled if and only if for suitably chosen observables , it yields a violation of inequalities imposed by local realistic theories @xcite . a unique measure of bipartite entanglement for pure states is given by the partial von neumann entropy , the von neumann entropy ( @xmath20 ) of the remaining system after tracing out either subsystem @xcite : @xmath21 , ranging between zero and one ( in units of `` edits '' ) .",
    "* mixed states * are more subtle , even for only two parties . as for the quantification of bipartite mixed - state entanglement , there are various measures available such as the entanglement of formation and distillation @xcite . only for pure states ,",
    "these measures coincide and equal the partial von neumann entropy .",
    "the definition of pure - state entanglement via the non - factorizability of the total state vector is generalized to mixed states through non - separability ( or inseparability ) of the total density operator .",
    "a general quantum state of a two - party system is separable if its total density operator is a mixture ( a convex sum ) of product states @xcite , @xmath22 otherwise , it is inseparable . to the pure maximally entangled `` bell state '' @xmath23 with the conjugate basis states @xmath24 .",
    "the separable state @xmath25 is classically correlated only with respect to the predetermined basis @xmath26 .",
    "however , the bell state @xmath27 is a priori quantum correlated in both bases @xmath26 and @xmath28 , and may become a posteriori classically correlated depending on the particular basis choice in a local measurement .",
    "similarly , we will see later that the inseparability criteria for continuous variables need to be expressed in terms of the positions and their conjugate momenta . ] in general , it is a non - trivial question whether a given density operator is separable or inseparable .",
    "nonetheless , a very convenient method to test for inseparability is peres partial transpose criterion @xcite . for a separable state as in eq .",
    "( [ pvlconvexsum ] ) , transposition of either density matrix yields again a legitimate non - negative density operator with unit trace , @xmath29 since @xmath30 corresponds to a legitimate density matrix .",
    "this is a necessary condition for a separable state , and hence a single negative eigenvalue of the partially transposed density matrix is a sufficient condition for inseparability . in the ( @xmath31)- and ( @xmath32)-dimensional cases ( and , for example",
    ", for two - mode gaussian states , see below ) , this condition is both necessary and sufficient . for any other dimension ,",
    "negative partial transpose is only sufficient for inseparability @xcite .",
    "that violates the so - called reduction criterion , @xmath33 or @xmath34 , is both inseparable and distillable @xcite .",
    "this reduction criterion is in general weaker than the partial transpose criterion and the two criteria are equivalent in the ( @xmath31)- and ( @xmath32)-dimensional cases . ]",
    "other sufficient inseparability criteria include violations of inequalities imposed by local realistic theories ( though mixed inseparable states do not necessarily lead to such violations ) , an entropic inequality [ namely @xmath35 , again with @xmath36 @xcite , and a condition based on the theory of majorization @xcite .",
    "concluding the discussion of two - party entanglement , we emphasize that both the pure - state schmidt decomposition and the partial transpose criterion for mixed states are also applicable to infinite dimensions .",
    "an example for the infinite - dimensional schmidt decomposition is the two - mode squeezed vacuum state in the fock ( photon number ) basis @xcite .",
    "the unphysical operation ( a positive , but not completely positive map ) that corresponds to the transposition is time reversal @xcite : in terms of continuous variables , any separable two - party state remains a legitimate state after the transformation @xmath37 , where @xmath38 are the phase - space variables ( positions and momenta ) for example in the wigner representation .",
    "however , arbitrary inseparable states may be turned into unphysical states , and furthermore , inseparable two - party two - mode gaussian states always become unphysical via this transformation @xcite .    *",
    "multipartite entanglement * , the entanglement shared by more than two parties , is a more complex issue . for * pure * multi - party states , a schmidt decomposition does not exist in general .",
    "the total state vector then can not be written as a single sum over orthonormal basis states .",
    "there is , however , one very important representative of multipartite entanglement which does have the form of a multi - party schmidt decomposition , namely the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite @xmath39 here given as a three - qubit state .",
    "although there is no rigorous definition of maximally entangled multi - party states due to the lack of a general schmidt decomposition , the form of the ghz state with all `` schmidt coefficients '' equal suggests that it exhibits maximum multipartite entanglement .",
    "in fact , there are various reasons for assigning the attribute `` maximally entangled '' to the @xmath0-party ghz states [ @xmath40 .",
    "for example , they yield the maximum violations of multi - party inequalities imposed by local realistic theories @xcite .",
    "further , their entanglement heavily relies on all parties , and if examined pairwise they do not contain simple bipartite entanglement ( see below ) .    for the case of three qubits , any pure and fully entangled state can be transformed to either the ghz state or the so - called w state @xcite , @xmath41 via stochastic local operations and classical communication ( `` slocc '' , where stochastic means that the state is transformed with non - zero probability ) .",
    "thus , with respect to slocc , there are two inequivalent classes of genuine tripartite entanglement , represented by the ghz and the w state .",
    "genuinely or fully tripartite entangled here means that the entanglement of the three - qubit state is not just present between two parties while the remaining party can be separated by a tensor product .",
    "though genuinely tripartite , the entanglement of the w state is also `` readily bipartite '' .",
    "this means that the remaining two - party state after tracing out one party , @xmath42 is inseparable which can be verified by taking the partial transpose [ the eigenvalues are @xmath43 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "this is in contrast to the ghz state where tracing out one party yields the separable two - qubit state @xmath45 .",
    "the maximally mixed state of one qubit , however , is obtained after tracing out two parties of the ghz state .",
    "maximum bipartite entanglement is available from the ghz state through a local measurement of one party in the conjugate basis @xmath46 ( plus classical communication about the result ) , @xmath47 here , @xmath48 are two of the four bell states , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "what can be said about arbitrary * mixed * entangled states of more than two parties ?",
    "there is of course an immense variety of inequivalent classes of multi - party mixed states [ e.g. , five classes of three - qubit states of which the extreme cases are the fully separable ( @xmath51 ) and the fully ( genuinely ) inseparable states @xcite ] . in general ,",
    "multi - party inseparability criteria can not be formulated in such a compact form as the two - party partial transpose criterion .",
    "similarly , the quantification of multipartite entanglement , even for pure states , is still subject of current research .",
    "existing multi - party entanglement measures do not appear to be unique as is the partial von neumann entropy for pure two - party states .",
    "furthermore , violations of multi - party inequalities imposed by local realism do not necessarily imply genuine multi - party inseparability . in the case of continuous variables ,",
    "we may now focus on the following questions : how can we generate , measure , and ( theoretically and experimentally ) verify genuine multipartite entangled states ? how do the continuous - variable states compare to their qubit counterparts with respect to various properties ?",
    "a compact way to describe how entanglement may be created is in terms of a quantum circuit .",
    "quantum circuits consist of a sequence of unitary transformations ( quantum gates ) , sometimes supplemented by measurements .",
    "a quantum circuit is independent of a particular physical realization .",
    "let us consider the generation of entanglement between arbitrarily many qubits .",
    "the quantum circuit shall turn @xmath0 independent qubits into an @xmath0-partite entangled state .",
    "initially , the @xmath0 qubits shall be in the eigenstate @xmath52 .",
    "all we need is a circuit with the following two elementary gates : the hadamard gate , acting on a single qubit as @xmath53    = 3.0 in    and the controlled - not ( c - not ) gate , a two - qubit operation acting as @xmath54 with @xmath55 and the addition modulo two @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath0-partite entangled output state of the circuit ( see fig .  [ pvlcircuit ] ) is the @xmath0-qubit ghz state .",
    "let us translate the qubit quantum circuit to continuous variables @xcite .",
    "the position and momentum variables @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( units - free with @xmath59 , @xmath60=i\\delta_{lk}/2 $ ] ) may correspond to the quadrature amplitudes of a single electromagnetic mode , i.e. , the real and imaginary part of the single mode s annihilation operator : @xmath61 . at this stage , it is convenient to consider position and momentum eigenstates .",
    "we may now replace the hadamard by a fourier transform , @xmath62 with @xmath55 , has been replaced by the normal addition .",
    "however , for the quantum circuit here , a beam splitter operation as described by eq .",
    "( [ pvlbseigenstates ] ) is a suitable substitute for the generalized c - not gate . ]",
    "the input states are taken to be zero - position eigenstates @xmath63 .",
    "the sequence of beam splitter operations @xmath64 is provided by a network of ideal phase - free beam splitters ( with typically asymmetric transmittance and reflectivity ) acting on the position eigenstates as @xmath65 now we apply this sequence of beam splitters ( making an `` @xmath0-splitter '' ) , @xmath66 to a zero - momentum eigenstate @xmath67 of mode 1 ( the fourier transformed zero - position eigenstate ) and @xmath1 zero - position eigenstates @xmath63 in modes @xmath68 through @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain the entangled @xmath0-mode state @xmath69 .",
    "this state is an eigenstate with total momentum zero and all relative positions @xmath70 @xmath71 .",
    "it is clearly an analogue to the qubit ghz state with perfect correlations among the quadratures .",
    "however , it is an unphysical and unnormalizable state ( e.g. , for two modes , it corresponds to the maximally entangled , infinitely squeezed two - mode squeezed vacuum state with infinite energy ) . rather than sending infinitely squeezed",
    "position eigenstates through the entanglement - generating circuit , we will now use finitely squeezed states .    in the heisenberg representation ,",
    "an ideal phase - free beam splitter operation acting on two modes with annihilation operators @xmath72 and @xmath73 is described by @xmath74 let us now define a matrix @xmath75 which is an @xmath0-dimensional identity matrix with the entries @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 replaced by the corresponding entries of the above beam splitter matrix .",
    "thus , the matrix for the @xmath0-splitter becomes @xmath80 the entanglement - generating circuit is now applied to @xmath0 position - squeezed vacuum modes . in other words , one momentum - squeezed and @xmath1 position - squeezed vacuum modes are coupled by an @xmath0-splitter , @xmath81 where the input modes are squeezed @xcite according to @xmath82 with @xmath83 and vacuum modes labeled by the superscript ` @xmath84 ' . in terms of the input quadratures",
    ", we have @xmath85 for @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the squeezing parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 determine the degree of squeezing of the momentum - squeezed and the @xmath1 position - squeezed modes , respectively . the correlations between the output quadratures are revealed by the arbitrarily small noise in the relative positions and the total momentum for sufficiently large squeezing @xmath88 and @xmath89 , @xmath90 for @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) and @xmath93 .",
    "note that all modes involved have zero mean values , thus the variances and the second moments are identical .      rather than constructing a circuit for generating entangled states ,",
    "now our task shall be the measurement of multi - party entanglement , i.e. , the projection onto the basis of maximally entangled multi - party states . for qubits , it is well - known that this can be achieved simply by inverting the above entanglement - generating circuit ( a similar strategy also works for @xmath18-level systems @xcite ) .",
    "the ghz basis states for @xmath0 qubits read @xmath94 where @xmath95 . the projection onto the basis states @xmath96 is accomplished when the output states of the inverted circuit ( see fig .  [ pvlcircuit ] ) , @xmath97 are measured in the computational basis .",
    "eventually , @xmath96 are distinguished via the measured output states @xmath98    reentering the domain of continuous variables , let us now introduce the maximally entangled states @xmath99 since @xmath100 and @xmath101 , they form a complete , @xmath102 and orthogonal , @xmath103 set of basis states for @xmath0 modes . for creating continuous - variable entanglement , we simply replaced the c - not gates by appropriate beam splitter operations .",
    "let us employ the same strategy here in order to measure continuous - variable entanglement . in other words , a projection onto the continuous - variable ghz basis @xmath104 shall be performed by applying an inverse @xmath0-splitter followed by a fourier transform of mode 1 and by subsequently measuring the positions of all modes .",
    "for an @xmath0-mode state with modes @xmath105 , this means that we effectively measure @xmath106 , with @xmath107 for instance , in the three - mode case , the measured observables are @xmath108 where here @xmath109 .",
    "in fact , in a single shot , the quantities @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 are determined through these measurements , and so are all the parameters @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 required to detect the basis state @xmath116 from eq .",
    "( [ pvlmaxentghzbasis ] ) with @xmath117 . in general , for arbitrary @xmath0 , the measurements yield @xmath118 and @xmath119 where @xmath120 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , ... , and @xmath121 .",
    "this confirms that the inverse @xmath0-splitter combined with the appropriate homodyne detections ( that is tools solely from linear optics ) enables in principle a complete distinction of the basis states @xmath104 in eq .",
    "( [ pvlmaxentghzbasis ] ) .",
    "more precisely , the fidelity of the state discrimination can be arbitrarily high for sufficiently good accuracy of the homodyne detectors .",
    "we may conclude that the requirements of such a `` ghz state analyzer '' for continuous variables are easily met by current experimental capabilities .",
    "this is in contrast to the ghz state analyzer for photonic qubits [ capable of discriminating or measuring states like those in eq .",
    "( [ pvlqubitghzbasis ] ) ] .",
    "although arbitrarily high fidelity can be approached in principle using linear optics and photon number detectors , one would need sufficiently many , highly entangled auxiliary photons and detectors resolving correspondingly large photon numbers @xcite .",
    "neither of these requirements is met by current technology .",
    "of course , the c - not gates of a qubit ghz state measurement device can in principle be implemented via the so - called cross kerr effect using nonlinear optics . however , on the single - photon level , this would require optical nonlinearities of exotic strength .    in this section ,",
    "we have shown how measurements onto the maximally entangled continuous - variable ghz basis can be realized using linear optics and quadrature detections .",
    "these schemes are an extension of the well - known two - party case , where the continuous - variable bell basis [ eq .  ( [ pvlmaxentghzbasis ] ) with @xmath122 is the analogue to the qubit bell states [ eq .",
    "( [ pvlqubitghzbasis ] ) with @xmath122 .",
    "the continuous - variable and the qubit bell states form those measurement bases that were used in the quantum teleportation experiments @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the extension of measurements onto the maximally entangled basis to more than two parties and their potential optical realization in the continuous - variable realm might be relevant to multi - party quantum communication protocols such as the multi - party generalization of entanglement swapping @xcite .",
    "however , the entanglement resources in a continuous - variable protocol , namely the entangled continuous - variable states that are producible with squeezed light and beam splitters , exhibit only imperfect entanglement due to the finite degree of the squeezing .",
    "when can we actually be sure that they are multi - party entangled at all ? in the next section , we will address this question and discuss criteria for the theoretical and the experimental verification of multipartite continuous - variable entanglement .      for continuous - variable two - party states , an inseparability criterion can be derived that does not rely on the partial transpose .",
    "it is based on the variances of quadrature combinations such as @xmath123 and @xmath124 , motivated by the fact that the maximally entangled bipartite state @xmath125 is a ( zero-)eigenstate of these two combinations @xcite .",
    "similarly , in a continuous - variable bell measurement , the quadrature combinations @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the relevant observables to be detected . hence , for two modes , applying the variance - based inseparability criterion and measuring in the maximally entangled basis can both be accomplished by equal means , namely a single beam splitter and two homodyne detectors . in other words ,",
    "the effectively inverse circuit for the generation of bipartite entanglement provides the recipe for both measuring maximum entanglement and verifying nonmaximum entanglement .",
    "when looking for multi - party inseparability criteria for arbitrarily many modes , it seems to be natural to pursue a similar strategy .",
    "we are therefore aiming at a criterion which is based on the variances of those quadrature combinations that are the measured observables in a continuous - variable ghz measurement .",
    "let us consider three modes . according to eq .",
    "( [ pvlmeasobsn=3 ] ) , we define the operators @xmath126 where we added a factor of @xmath127 in @xmath128 compared to the first line of eq .",
    "( [ pvlmeasobsn=3 ] ) .",
    "let us further assume that the three - party state @xmath25 is fully separable and can be written as a mixture of tripartite product states , @xmath129 using this state , we can calculate the total variance of the operators in eq .",

    "would imply that the quantum state concerned is not fully separable as in eq .",
    "( [ pvl3rho ] ) .",
    "but would this also imply that the quantum state is genuinely tripartite entangled in the sense that none of the parties can be separated from the others ( as , for example , in the pure qubit states @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) ?",
    "this is obviously not the case and a total variance below 1 does not rule out the possibility of _ partial separability_. the quantum state might still not be a genuine tripartite entangled state , since it might be written in one or more of the following forms @xcite : @xmath140 thus , in general , a violation of @xmath141 does not necessarily witness genuine tripartite entanglement ( a counterexample will be given below ) .",
    "however , it does witness genuine tripartite entanglement when the quantum state in question is pure and totally symmetric with respect to all three subsystems @xcite . in that case , a possible separation of any individual subsystem , @xmath142 implies full separability , @xmath143 .",

    "let us conclude by asking whether we were able to find answers to the questions posed at the beginning of this chapter : how can we generate , measure , and ( theoretically and experimentally ) verify genuine multipartite entangled states for continuous variables ? how do the continuous - variable states compare to their qubit counterparts with respect to various properties ?    as for the generation , we demonstrated that genuinely @xmath0-party entangled states are producible with squeezed light resources and beam splitters . in particular ,",
    "one sufficiently squeezed light mode is in principle the only resource needed to create any degree of genuine multi - party entanglement by means of linear optics .",
    "the resulting states , though genuinely multi - party entangled , are always nonmaximally entangled multi - party states due to the finite amount of the squeezing .",
    "they behave like the @xmath0-party versions of the qubit state @xmath139 .",
    "first , they also contain bipartite entanglement readily available between any pair of modes ( just as @xmath139 and as opposed to the qubit state @xmath138 ) .",
    "secondly , they yield a non - exponential increase of violations of multi - party bell - type inequalities for growing number of parties ( as for @xmath139 and different from the qubit state @xmath138 for which the increase is exponential ) .",
    "furthermore , we have seen that by inverting the circuits for generating genuine but nonmaximum multi - party entanglement , one can perform projection measurements onto the maximally entangled multi - party ( ghz ) basis for continuous variables .",
    "in contrast to the difficulties in performing such measurements for photonic qubits within the framework of linear optics , continuous - variable ghz measurements only require beam splitters and homodyne detectors .",
    "in addition , we showed that the circuits for measuring maximum ghz entanglement are also applicable to the theoretical and experimental verification of the nonmaximum entanglement of the multi - party states ( which are those producible in the laboratory ) .",
    "the circuits provide a necessary condition for full separability of any @xmath0-partite @xmath0-mode state ( pure or mixed , gaussian or non - gaussian ) with any number of modes @xmath0 .",
    "however , this condition is not sufficient for full separability and , more importantly , its violation does not verify genuine but only partial multipartite entanglement . for the theoretical verification of genuine multipartite entanglement , additional assumptions have to be taken into account such as the total symmetry of the relevant states . therefore , an unambiguous experimental proof of genuine multipartite entanglement of continuous - variable states was not proposed in this chapter .",
    "a possible approach to this would be to consider the violation of stricter @xmath0-party bell - type inequalities which can not be violated by only partially entangled states .",
    "however , the experimental nonlocality test would then rely on observables such as the photon number parity , and hence become unfeasible with current technology . more desirable would be a test for genuine multipartite entanglement that is solely based on linear optics and efficient homodyne detections .",
