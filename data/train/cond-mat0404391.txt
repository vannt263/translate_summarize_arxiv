    "@xcite while passing through the crystal , the electron is scattered by impurities and its momentum changes randomly with time . as a consequence , the effective magnetic field also changes randomly with a correlation time of the order of the momentum relaxation time @xmath1 .",

    "for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) case , when the electron motion in one direction is confined by the quantum well , the spin splitting and , hence , the precession frequency are proportional to the in - plane electron velocity @xcite @xmath6 so , at low temperatures , when inelastic processes can be disregarded , the spin relaxation rate for a 2d electron with a given energy @xmath7 is proportional to the particle diffusion coefficient @xmath8 the effects of localization on the particle diffusion have been discussed in a great number of publications . the first - order term in a series expansion of @xmath9 in @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the mean free path",

    "a remarkable feature of this correction is the logarithmic divergence at low temperatures in the 2d case .",
    "equation   implies a similar divergence of the spin relaxation rate .",
    "such a divergence was first predicted by singh @xcite in spin correlation functions for a system with spin - dependent impurity scattering .",
