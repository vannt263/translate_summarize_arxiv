    "with the advent of the attosecond pulse techniques ( see , e.g. refs . @xcite and the references therein )",
    "the scientific community obtained a powerful tool to monitor the electron dynamics in atomic and molecular systems and to study processes that take place on a time scale in which the electronic motion is still disentangled from the slower nuclear dynamics .",
    "such kind of processes are , for example , the response of the electronic cloud to an ultrafast perturbation , like ultrafast excitation or ionization @xcite .",
    "about ten years ago in a first work @xcite it was shown that indeed after a sudden ionization rich ultrafast electron dynamics may occur .",
    "the positive charge created after the ionization can migrate throughout the system solely driven by the electronic many - body effects  the electron correlation and electron relaxation @xcite . since",
    "this charge migration is ultrafast , typically few femtoseconds @xcite , it can be calculated neglecting the nuclear motion as long as one is concerned with the relevant time interval during which this ultrafast process takes place .",
    "clearly , at later times the nuclear dynamics will come into play and will perturb the picture .",
    "thus , if we wish to know precisely what happens at this later stage , the nuclear motion must be considered . however , since several or even many electronic states participate , an adequate description of the nuclear motion is rather involved . it should be noted , in this respect , that very recently a time - dependent born - oppenheimer approximation for treating quantum mechanically coupled electron - nuclear dynamics was proposed @xcite which might provide a possibility to attack such complicated problems .    we have studied the charge migration in different molecules @xcite and found that it usually takes place after ionization in the inner - valence shell where the electron correlation effects are typically much stronger than in the outer - valence shell . however , very recently we have shown that the charge migration phenomenon is not inherent only to the inner - valence ionized states but can take place also after an outer - valence ionization @xcite .",
    "the system studied in ref .",
    "@xcite possesses a chromophore - donor site which is initially ionized and the created hole charge migrates throughout the system to the amine - acceptor site within just 4 fs .",
    "further analysis @xcite then showed that the mechanism underlying this ultrafast migration is the so - called hole mixing @xcite which is one of several ways of the manifestation of electronic many - body effects in the ionization process @xcite .    in the present work we want to continue the investigation of ultrafast electron dynamics following ionization of the outer - valence shell focusing on a different mechanism , namely the so - called dominant satellite mechanism .",
    "it is known from the early days of the photoelectron spectroscopy that the correlation and relaxation effects can lead to the appearance of additional weak bands in the photoelectron spectrum , the so - called shake - up or satellite bands , which correspond to excitation processes accompanying the ionization @xcite .",
    "this kind of shake - up states are typical for the inner - valence and core ionization and appear in the ionization spectra of nearly every atom or molecule .",
    "however , numerous theoretical and experimental studies showed that there are certain classes of compounds where satellites can appear also in the outer - valence region .",
    "these are systems containing heavier atoms , like transition - metal complexes @xcite , or @xmath1-electron systems @xcite , which have low - energy virtual orbitals . here",
    "we will concentrate on the latter class of systems and will investigate the impact of the low - lying satellites on the electron dynamics following outer - valence ionization of some organic unsaturated nitroso compounds @xcite .",

    "in this section we briefly review the theoretical background of the methodology used to study ultrafast electron dynamics following ionization of a system . for technical details",
    "we refer the reader to refs @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our investigation is a neutral molecule in its ground state @xmath2 .",
    "the ionization of the system brings it into a non - stationary state @xmath3 . a convenient quantity then for tracing the succeeding electron dynamics is the density of the so created initial hole which can be defined by the following expression : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electron density operator . the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , @xmath6 , is the ground state density of the neutral system and is time - independent .",
    "the second term , @xmath7 , is the density of the cation and hence is time dependent , since @xmath3 is not an eigenstate of the cationic system .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 , referred hereafter as the _ hole density _ , describes the density of the hole at position @xmath9 and time @xmath10 and by construction is normalized at all times @xmath10 .    in the heisenberg picture ,",
    "the time - dependent part @xmath11 reads : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the propagating multielectron wavepacket .    using the standard representation of the density operator in a one particle basis @xmath14 and occupation numbers",
    "@xmath15 , eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) can be rewritten as follows @xmath16 where the matrix @xmath17 with elements @xmath18 is referred to as the hole density matrix .",
    "the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq_n_t ] ) is obtained by inserting in eq .",
    "( [ eq_rho_i ] ) a resolution of identity of a complete set of appropriate ionic eigenstates @xmath19 before and after the density operator @xmath20 .",
    "the matrix @xmath21 is thus the representation of the density operator within this basis .",
    "diagonalization of the matrix @xmath22 for fixed time points @xmath10 yields the following expression for the hole density @xmath23 where @xmath24 are called _ natural charge orbitals _ , and @xmath25 are their _ hole occupation numbers_. the hole occupation number @xmath25 contains the information on which part of the created hole charge is in the natural charge orbital @xmath24 at time @xmath10 . because of the charge conservation , one finds that @xmath26 at any time @xmath10 .    for calculating the hole density and its constituents we use _ ab initio _ methods only .",
    "the whole calculation consists of four steps . after determining the molecular geometry ,",
    "the first step is a hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation .",
    "the second step is the calculation of the relevant part of the ionization spectrum via green s function formalism .",
    "a computationally very successful approach to obtain the green s function is the _ algebraic diagrammatic construction _ [ adc(@xmath27 ) ] scheme @xcite . in the present calculation we used the non - dyson adc(3 )",
    "method @xcite realized within the so - called intermediate - state representation @xcite , an effective many - body basis serving as @xmath19 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq_n_t ] ) .",
    "the third step is the propagation of the multielectron wavepacket of the ionized system @xcite with the help of the short iterative lanczos technique @xcite .",
    "the fourth and last step is to build through eq .",
    "( [ eq_n_t ] ) the matrix @xmath28 and to diagonalize it in order to obtain the natural charge orbitals @xmath29 and the hole occupation numbers @xmath30 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq_q_n ] ) . with the help of these quantities",
    "we can now trace the evolution of the hole density of a system after suddenly removing one of its electrons .    at this point",
    "we would like to comment briefly on the choice of the initial state @xmath3 .",
    "the above sketched methodology is independent of the particular choice and the way of preparation of the initial state as long as the ionized electron is removed from the system on a shorter time scale than that of the charge migration .",
    "the assumption made is that the initially created ionic state can be described by a separable manyelectron wavefunction , i.e. the interaction between the ionized electron and the remaining core is neglected  sudden approximation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . within this approximation",
    "the initial hole is described by the so - called dyson orbital , i.e. the overlap between the @xmath31-electron initial and @xmath32-electron final wavefunctions . however , in the outer - valence region the dyson orbitals differ very little from the canonical hartree - fock orbitals @xcite . that is why , in the numerical calculations to be discussed in this paper the initial state is prepared through a sudden removal of an electron from a particular hf - orbital .",
    "the initial state can , of course , be constructed such that it corresponds to a removal of an electron from a linear combination of hf - orbitals .",
    "this liberty allows one to reproduce the hole density of practically every particular initial vacancy . however , to avoid investigating many linear combinations of hf - orbitals of interest we concentrate on specific hf - orbitals . in this way we can unambiguously identify the basic mechanisms leading to charge migration .",
    "since the time - dependent schrdinger equation which governs the electron dynamics is a linear equation , these mechanisms are also operative when other choices of the initial state are used .      here",
    "we will briefly review the basic mechanisms of charge migration referring the interested reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .    for proper understanding of the basic mechanisms of ultrafast charge migration following ionization",
    "it is illuminative to analyze a typical ionization spectrum .",
    "the calculated cationic spectrum consists of vertical lines , where each line represents a cationic eigenstate @xmath33 .",
    "the position of the line is given by the ionization energy , and its hight  by the square of the transition amplitude @xmath34 , a quantity related to the ionization cross section .",
    "for the ease of interpretation we will expand the exact cationic state @xmath33 in a series of electronic configurations , as is traditionally done in configuration interaction ( ci ) calculations ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) : latexmath:[\\[\\label{cat_state }    where @xmath2 is the exact ground state of the neutral system , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the annihilation and creation operators , respectively , and @xmath38 s are the expansion coefficients . the indices @xmath39 refer to unoccupied ( virtual ) orbitals ( or particles ) , whereas the indices @xmath40 indicate occupied orbitals ( or holes ) . throughout the whole text @xmath41 will be used as general indices .",
    "accordingly , the terms @xmath42 are called one - hole ( 1h ) configurations , since one electron has been removed from the corresponding occupied orbital , the terms @xmath43 are referred to as two - hole - one - particle ( 2h1p ) configurations , indicating that in addition to the removal of one electron another one is excited to a virtual orbital , and so forth . note that in the spirit of the gf approach , which accounts also for the ground - state correlations , in eq . ( [ cat_state ] )",
    "the expansion is applied on the exact ground state @xmath2 , rather on the uncorrelated hf one @xmath44 as in the usual ci calculations .    as was noted above , in our study",
    "the initially prepared non - stationary ionic state is created by suddenly removing an electron from a particular hf - orbital , i.e. by acting with the corresponding annihilation operator on the ground state of the neutral , @xmath45 .",
    "thus , only the 1h configurations contribute to the transition amplitude @xmath34 , i.e. to the spectral intensity . without correlation effects ,",
    "the spectrum will consist of lines , one for every occupied orbital @xmath46 , with intensities equal to 1 .",
    "if correlation effects are weak , the ionization spectrum will consist of _ main lines _ which have large overlap with the 1h configurations .",
    "this is typical when ionizing the outer - valence shell of a system . in this case",
    "the molecular orbital picture is still valid .",
    "if the correlation effects are stronger , beside the main line _ satellite lines _ will appear .",
    "the intensities of the satellite lines are weaker than those of the main lines since they correspond to cationic states that are dominated by 2h1p configurations and have only small or moderate overlap with the 1h configurations .",
    "three types of satellites can be distinguished @xcite : _ relaxation satellites _ where at least one of the two holes in the 2h1p configuration is identical to the 1h orbital of the main line , _ correlation satellites _ where both holes differ from the 1h orbital of the main line , and _ ground - state - correlation satellites _ stemming from the correlation effects present in the ground state of the neutral . in the inner - valence ,",
    "where the correlation effects are strong , the distinction between the main lines and the satellites cease to exist and the spectrum becomes a quasicontinuum of lines with small to moderate intensities .",
    "this phenomenon is known as breakdown of the molecular orbital picture @xcite .",
    "depending on the structure of the ionic states involved , three basic mechanisms of charge migration have been identified @xcite : the hole mixing case , the dominant satellite case , and the breakdown of the molecular orbital picture case . in what follows",
    "we will briefly describe them .",
    "( _ i _ ) hole mixing case . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider the two - hole mixing , i.e. the situation when two lines in the spectrum correspond to ionic states which are linear combinations of two 1h configurations @xmath42 and @xmath47 . in this idealized case , if we create the initial hole in one of the orbitals , say @xmath48 , then the hole will oscillate between the two orbitals @xmath48 and @xmath49 with a frequency determined by the energy difference between the two ionic states .",
    "if the two orbitals are localized on two different sites of the system , the hole mixing mechanism will lead to an oscillation of the initially created positive charge between these two sites .",
    "the hole mixing mechanism was identified as the driving force of the ultrafast charge migration following outer- and inner - valence ionization in many different molecular systems ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "( _ ii _ ) dominant satellite case .",
    "let us consider the situation when we have two ionic states , a main state and a satellite , both having overlap with the original 1h configuration .",
    "in ci language these states can be written as @xmath50 and @xmath51 satisfy the equation @xmath52 . in this idealized case , assuming that all involved orbitals @xmath46 , @xmath49 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are different , i.e. the case of a correlation satellite , we will observe the following electron dynamics succeeding the ionization out of orbital @xmath46 .",
    "the hole initially localized on orbital @xmath46 will migrate to the orbital @xmath49 ( or @xmath53 ) accompanied by an excitation from orbital @xmath53 ( or @xmath49 ) to the virtual orbital @xmath54 . again",
    "the dynamics will be oscillatory with a period determined by the energy differences between the states @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this type of mechanism was identified to be responsible for the ultrafast electron dynamics taking place after inner - valence ionization in several systems @xcite .",
    "we note at this point that there is also a dominant _ relaxation _ satellite mechanism which is not discussed so far and will be investigated for the first time in the present paper .    ( _ iii _ ) breakdown of the molecular orbital picture case . in the inner - valence region of the spectrum , where the quasicontinuum of lines appears",
    ", one can distinguish two general cases depending on whether the states are below or above the double ionization threshold of the system . supposing that the quasicontinuum of states has a lorentzian shape , in both cases the initially ionized orbital will `` lose '' its positive charge exponentially with time .",
    "if the states are below the double ionization threshold , the charge will be typically shared among many other orbitals and at the end of the process will be spread more - or - less uniformly over the whole cation .",
    "this situation was studied in refs .",
    "if the states are above the double ionization threshold , i.e. an electronic decay channel is open , this mechanism will describe the process of emission of a secondary electron .",
    "this situation was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work",
    "we will concentrate on the dominant relaxation satellite mechanism of charge migration , and will discuss for the first time the manifestation of this mechanism after ionization of the outer - valence shell .",
    "we applied the methodology sketched in sec .",
    "[ basics ] to several molecules known to posses low - lying satellites in order to trace in real time and space the response of the electronic cloud of these systems to the sudden removal of an electron from their outer - valence shell .",
    "the systems studied were organic unsaturated nitroso compounds theoretically investigated by wardermann and von niessen @xcite . the molecular geometries were optimized using dft methodology ( bp86/sv(p ) ) . throughout the remaining calculations standard",
    "dz basis sets @xcite were used . all studied molecules show very similar behavior , thus in this paper we will present only one of them , namely the molecule 2-nitroso[1,3]oxazolo[5,4-d][1,3]oxazole ( see the sketch ) .",
    "the molecule is planar and belongs to the @xmath57 symmetry point group having 29 occupied orbitals in the @xmath58 irreducible representation ( irrep ) and 6 occupied orbitals in the irrep @xmath59 .",

    "all other colors are related to different 1h - configurations resulting from the removal of an electron out of a specific hf - orbital belonging to the @xmath58 irrep .",
    "it is seen that the main line at 9.6  ev , the satellite at 11.2  ev and the larger contribution to the satellite at 12.6  ev come from the same 1h configuration , namely the @xmath60 configuration which is given in green in the figure .",

    "the first cationic state , corresponding to the line at 9.6  ev , is constructed mainly from the @xmath60 1h configuration ( 63% ) and from the @xmath62 2h1p configuration ( 25% ) .",
    "the second state , corresponding to the satellite line at 11.2  ev , is also mainly constructed from the @xmath60 and @xmath62 configurations but their weights are inverted compared to the first cationic state .",
    "the third state at 12.6  ev consists of 17% @xmath60 , 10% of @xmath63 , and 43% of @xmath62 . in all states the missing contributions are distributed over many other 1h and 2h1p configurations .    obviously , we encounter the situation of a main line stemming from the ionization out of the homo and two relaxation satellites corresponding to an excitation of an electron from homo-1 to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) .",

    "here we would like to analyze in more detail the underlying mechanism of the ultrafast electron dynamics observed after sudden ionization of the homo of 2-nitroso[1,3]oxazolo[5,4-d][1,3]oxazole . the dominant satellite mechanism studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and described briefly in sec .",
    "[ cm_mechanisms ] provides an understanding for the impact of a _ correlation _ satellite on the electron dynamics following ionization .",
    "it leads to the migration of the initially created hole charge and a simultaneous excitation on top of it . however , as we saw in the previous section , in the case of dominant _ relaxation _ satellite we observe only the excitation while the initially created charge remains stationary ( see the red and black curves , denoted as @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , respectively in fig .",

    "this behavior can be understand with the help of a simple model .",

    "the initially created hole ( @xmath68 ) remains stationary , while an excitation from the occupied orbital ( @xmath66 ) to the virtual orbital ( @xmath67 ) is observed .",

    "it is seen that this simple two - state model reproduces the overall behavior of the cyclic excitation and de - excitation with a period of about 2.6  fs . the more involved beating pattern observed in fig .",
    "[ fig_occ ] can be explained easily by the influence of the third state at 12.6  ev .",
    "it is straightforward to show that in the case of a main state and two relaxation satellites having the form @xmath79 and supposing that @xmath80 , i.e. the 1h configuration @xmath81 does not contribute to the main state and one of the two satellites , the hole occupation numbers describing the excitation @xmath82 will be proportional to @xmath83 $ ] , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 , while the orbital @xmath86 will get no occupancy , i.e. @xmath87 .",
    "this is exactly the case realized in the example studied in the present paper where the 1h configuration @xmath81 corresponds to @xmath63 which contributes only to the second satellite state at 12.6  ev .",
    "it is seen that this second relaxation satellite will then just introduce an additional frequency @xmath88  fs@xmath78 corresponding to an oscillation period of about 1.4  fs and we will get the beating oscillation behavior observed in fig .",
    "[ fig_occ ] .",
    "the following comment is in order .",
    "although the relaxation satellite does not affect the dynamics of the initial hole charge itself ( the initial hole remains stationary ) , depending on the spatial distribution of the involved orbitals the dominant relaxation satellite mechanism can lead to a charge migration via hole screening .",
    "if the electron is ejected from a localized orbital @xmath68 and the unoccupied orbital @xmath67 is localized in the same region of space , then the initially created hole will be screened by the excitation @xmath82 .",
    "thus , in the idealized case when the orbitals @xmath68 and @xmath67 are localized on one site of the system , while the orbital @xmath66 is localized on a different site , the dominant relaxation satellite mechanism will lead to oscillations of the hole charge between these two moieties of the system .",
    "it has to be noted that the unoccupied orbitals are often delocalized and the realization of this simple mechanism of charge migration from one site to another is not very likely in such systems .",
    "this is also seen in the example presented in this work where the process represents rather an ultrafast delocalization and localization of the charge .",
    "however , in larger and/or strongly correlated systems where many orbitals can be mixed in the ionic states the hole - screening charge migration mechanism may be operative .",
    "we note that there do exist many systems with localized unoccupied orbitals , e.g. _",
    "para_-nitroaniline @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in large systems even @xmath89 orbitals are likely to be located on individual moieties . in all these kinds of systems",
    "one could expect ultrafast charge migration from one part of the system to another via the hole - screening excitation mechanism .",
    "let us summarize . in the present work we studied the ultrafast electron dynamics following outer - valence ionization of a molecular system concentrating on the impact of low - lying relaxation satellites .",
    "for that purpose we traced the evolution of the electronic cloud after sudden removal of an electron from the homo of some organic unsaturated nitroso compounds known to possess low - lying satellites .",
    "our results show that in all cases the initially created hole charge remains stationary but the system reacts by an ultrafast cyclic excitation - deexcitation process which leads to severe changes of the charge . in the presented example , the molecule 2-nitroso[1,3]oxazolo[5,4-d][1,3]oxazole , the @xmath0 excitation following the removal of the homo electron takes place on a sub - femtosecond time scale , the period of the excitation - deexcitation alternations being about 1.4  fs . in real space the processes of excitation and de - excitation represent ultrafast delocalization and localization of the charge .",
    "in other systems with more localized @xmath90 or @xmath89 orbitals one could anticipate by the same mechanism directed ultrafast charge migration from one site to another .    at the end",
