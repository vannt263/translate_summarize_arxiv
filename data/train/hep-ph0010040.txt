    "( [ lcwf ] ) over transverse momenta leads to the asymptotic form of the pion distribution amplitude @xmath17 .",
    "the use of the asymptotic form is justified through the phenomenology of the @xmath18-@xmath19-transition form factor  @xcite and the parameters of expression  ( [ lcwf ] ) are fixed by various pion decay processes  @xcite .",
    "the gaussian @xmath20-dependence describes well soft contributions  @xcite .",
    "the sudakov corrections are incorporated in the factor @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the sudakov function @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . since it suppresses large quark - antiquark separations it serves as a natural infrared cut - off and thus no external regulator",
    "is needed to avoid the singularity of @xmath3 .    in leading order qcd ,",
    "the hard photon - parton scattering amplitude @xmath23 is to be calculated from 20 one - gluon exchange diagrams , four representatives of which are shown in fig.[hsp diagrams ] .",
    "following the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite we choose the renormalisation scale @xmath24 to be the largest mass scale appearing in the gluon virtualities . owing to the structure of the hard scattering amplitude its analytical fourier transform can not be calculated exactly and we have to resort to approximations .",
    "as the longitudinal momentum fractions occur quadratically in the gluon propagators we keep transverse momentum corrections there if not otherwise stated .",
    "our results for the differential cross section at @xmath25 using different approximations for the quark propagators are shown in fig.[dsdz plot ] .",
    "the dot - dashed line shows the result obtained by replacing the quark propagators by their collinear limits . in the solid curve",
    "we take into account transverse momenta in quark propagators in those integration regions where they have singularities .",
    "we see that the effect in the few gev region is dramatic , which means that one can generally not ignore @xmath20-corrections in quark propagators , as has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , for instance . for comparison",
    "we also show the result of the collinear hard scattering approach , i.e. completely neglecting @xmath20-corrections in quark as well as in gluon propagators , where we have frozen @xmath3 below 1 gev ( dashed line ) .",
    "we note that our main result , given by the solid curve , approaches the collinear approximation for @xmath26 gev@xmath27 , i.e. for c.m .",
    "energies above 4 - 5 gev . in brief , the @xmath20-corrections of the quark propagators effect the transition amplitude such that it reduces its absolute magnitude while receiving a large phase .    in fig .",
    "[ sigma plot ] we therefore only compare our upper estimate , obtained by ignoring transverse momenta in the quark propagators and given by the dot - dashed line , with the data of the combined cross section @xmath28 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where we have accounted for the contributions from kaons by a relative factor @xmath29 . for comparison we again show the collinear approximation .",
    "as we can see , the curves are already far below the data , so that the inclusion of @xmath20-corrections in the quark propagators would further increase the discrepancy .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that , in the collinear approximation , essential parts of the hard scattering amplitudes are accidentally proportional to the pion form factor . using this relation and a phenomenological value for @xmath30 the authors of  @xcite obtained reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "however , we would like to emphasise that the assumed value for the pion form factor , @xmath31 gev@xmath27 , is rather large for a perturbative calculation . with a renormalisation scale of the order of the typical virtuality of the exchanged gluon and using the asymptotic form of the pion distribution amplitude ,",
    "the pion form factor in the collinear approach reads  @xcite @xmath32 and ranges between 0.17 and 0.1 gev@xmath27 for 1  gev@xmath334  gev . since the pion form factor enters the cross section for @xmath4 quadratically that accounts for the difference between our result for the collinear approximation and that of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that with the inclusion of @xmath20-corrections in the hard scattering amplitude the simple relation between the cross section and the pion form factor does not longer hold .",
    "in particular , our predictions are independent of any phenomenological value for the pion form factor .",
    "we now turn to the kinematical regime where one of the photons has a large virtuality @xmath6 . in refs .  @xcite it was shown that for @xmath34 the helicity amplitude of @xmath35 factorises in a hard part and a generalised distribution amplitude @xmath36 : @xmath37 where the light - cone fractions @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively describe how the partons and the pions share the light - cone plus component of the total momentum @xmath40 of the pions and the sum runs over all quark flavours @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath7-da , first discussed in  @xcite , represents the collinear hadronisation of two partons into a pion pair .",
    "the helicity selection rule , expressed through the kronecker delta , immediately follows from the collinear scattering of massless quarks .",
    "note that apart from logarithmic corrections the leading order expression  ( [ helamp ] ) is completely independent of @xmath42 .    if we demand that @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a typical hadronic scale of the order of 1 gev , while keeping the constraint that the photon virtuality is the dominant scale , @xmath34 , we can use the conventional hard scattering approach  @xcite to calculate the helicity amplitude  ( [ helamp ] ) in terms of the hard scattering amplitude @xmath23 and two single pion das @xmath17 : @xmath45 using light - cone gauge and organising the result in powers of @xmath46 one can show  @xcite that the leading contributions are independent of @xmath42 , reflecting the correct scaling behaviour , and come from the diagrams of the group  b in fig .",

    "reexpressing eq .",
    "( [ shsp ] ) through the light - cone fractions @xmath47 and @xmath48 for each diagram , we can then read off the large-@xmath1 limit of the @xmath7-da for a flavour @xmath49 by comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ helamp ] ) and  ( [ shsp ] ) : @xmath50 where the integral @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 the @xmath7-das for u- and d - quarks are related by @xmath53 and since higher fock states are suppressed by powers of @xmath54 there is no s - quark contribution .",
    "the @xmath55 scaling of eq .",
    "( [ model da ] ) is a characteristic feature of the hard scattering approach  @xcite .",
    "our result manifestly fulfills the charge conjugation relation @xmath56 and it can be shown to comply with a general polynomiality condition  @xcite .",
    "it possesses integrable logarithmic singularities at @xmath57 , which reflect the above mentioned endpoint problems of the collinear hard scattering approach when the exchanged gluon becomes soft .",
    "two - photon annihilation into pion pairs allows for a sensitive test of perturbative qcd . using a self - consistent approach , where there are no large endpoint contributions spoiling the applicability of perturbation theory , we have shown that the hard contributions are not sufficient to explain the experimental data of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore considerable soft contributions have to be expected .",
    "new data are desireable to determine the onset of the perturbative regime , which seems not to start below c.m .",
    "energies of 4 - 5 gev .",
    "when one of the photons is far off - shell and at large @xmath1 , where transverse momenta become irrelevant , the collinear hard scattering approach can be applied to calculate the perturbative limit of the @xmath7-da in terms of the conventional pion distribution amplitudes .",
