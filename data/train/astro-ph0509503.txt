    "since the very first observations , ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) have been an open question and a priority in astroparticle physics .",
    "their origin , nature and possible acceleration mechanisms are still a mystery .    due to the very low flux of high energy cosmic rays",
    ", measuring extensive air showers ( eas ) is the only possible technique to learn about the shape of the uhecr spectrum and their chemical composition .",
    "two different ways have been historically applied to observe and analyze eas s : ground array of detectors and optical detectors .",
    "surface detectors measure a lateral density sample and trigger in coincidence when charged particles pass through them while optical detectors ( i.e. , fluorescence detectors ) observe the longitudinal profile evolution by measuring the fluorescence light from atmospheric nitrogen excitation produced by the ionization of the secondary charged particles ( essentially electrons and positrons ) .",
    "the combination of shower observables ( such as lateral density , the depth of maximum shower development ( @xmath0 ) , the number of charged particles at shower maximum ( @xmath1 ) and number of muons ( @xmath2 ) at detector observation level ) and simulation techniques is the current way to obtain information about the primary energy , composition and arrival direction . for this purpose the shower simulation should provide all possible , and ideally the necessary , information to interpret measurements of shower parameters .",
    "many shower simulation packages have been developed over the years .",
    "most of them are based on the monte carlo method and simulate complete high energy showers with well described fluctuations in the first particle interactions and realistic distributions of energy of shower particles .",
    "recently , different ways of calculating the air shower development have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "most of them combine the traditional monte carlo scheme with a system of electromagnetic and hadronic cascade equations or pre - simulated showers , described with parameterizations .    in the present contribution",
    "we analyze the results obtained by the seneca  @xcite code which is based on the monte carlo calculation of the first and final stages of the air shower development , and on a cascade equation system that connects both stages reproducing the longitudinal shower development .",
    "we explore the main longitudinal shower characteristics of proton and gamma initiated air showers at ultra - high energy , as predicted by the qgsjet  @xcite and sibyll  @xcite hadronic interaction models .",
    "the seneca predictions are compared with the well tested corsika ( cosmic ray simulations for kascade ) simulation code  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this approach is the generation of eas s in a fast manner , obtaining the correct description of the fluctuations in showers and giving the average values for the shower characteristics .",
    "even though the seneca code describes both longitudinal and lateral air shower developments , the simulation scheme is used here to generate large statistics of longitudinal shower profiles applicable mainly to the present fluorescence detectors , such as pierre auger observatory  @xcite and hires  @xcite , as well to the future telescope euso  @xcite .    for the present work we track explicitly every particle with energy above the fraction @xmath3=@xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the primary shower energy , studying in detail the initial part of the shower .",
    "all secondary particles with energy below the mentioned fraction are taken as initial conditions to initialize a system of hadronic and electromagnetic cascade equations  @xcite .",
    "we use the cascade equations with the minimum electromagnetic energy thresholds of 1  gev for the electromagnetic component ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7=@xmath8  gev for the hadronic component .",
    "the hadronic interactions at high energies are calculated with both qgsjet01",

    "although the simulation of showers at fixed energies is not a very realistic application we intend in the present contribution to compare quantitatively seneca predictions for both hadronic interaction models , providing few comparisons with corsika results . such study can be useful to many experiments which use the fluorescence technique .    in order to make a simple comparison fig .",

    "it is possible to verify a reasonable difference between the longitudinal profiles obtained for both hadronic interaction models .",
    "such predictions reveal distinct descriptions of the @xmath11 fluctuations . moreover , the evolution of hadron - induced showers depends on the elasticity of the interaction defined as the fraction of energy carried by the leading secondary particle .",

    "for the proton showers ( left panel ) , it is quite visible that the hybrid approach generates a more scattered distribution of showers , with wider tales , than corsika does .",
    "this is confirmed by counting the number of events inside the small box shown in the figure .",
    "seneca expectation amounts to 80% of the proton showers falling inside the box while corsika expectation is 85% .",
    "the differences mentioned here are most , in principle , due to the air shower fluctuations and are visibly model dependent .",
