    "in a pioneering work by friedberg _ et al_.  in 1976 @xcite , nontopological solitons were introduced in a model with a u(1)-symmetric complex scalar field coupled to a real scalar field .",
    "in contrast with topological defects , they are stabilized by a global u(1 ) charge , and their energy density is localized in a finite space region without gauge fields . in 1985 coleman showed such solitons exist in a simpler model with an so(2 ) [ viz .",
    "u(1 ) ] symmetric scalar field only , and called them q - balls @xcite .",
    "q - balls have attracted much attention in particle cosmology since kusenko pointed out that they can exist in all supersymmetric extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "specifically , q - balls can be produced efficiently in the affleck - dine ( ad ) mechanism @xcite and could be responsible for baryon asymmetry @xcite and dark matter @xcite .",
    "q - balls can also influence the fate of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "since q - balls are supposed to be microscopic objects , equilibrium solutions and their stability have been intensively studied in flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "it was shown that catastrophe theory is a useful tool for stability analysis of q - balls @xcite .",
    "if q - balls are so large or so massive , on the other hand , their size becomes astronomical and their gravitational effects are remarkable @xcite .",
    "such gravitating q - balls , or q - stars , are analogous to boson stars @xcite .",
    "while q - balls exist even in flat spacetime , boson stars are supported by gravity and nonexistent in flat spacetime .",
    "multamaki and vilja showed that the size of q - balls is bounded above due to gravity @xcite .",
    "et al_.  studied evolution of unstable solutions by numerical analysis of dynamical field equations @xcite .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite we studied equilibrium solutions and their stability for several models using catastrophe theory to understand a comprehensive picture of flat q - balls , gravitating q - balls and boson stars .",
    "one of the main results is summarized in table i.    * in flat spacetime , as long as the absolute minimum of the potential @xmath4 is located at @xmath5 , there is no upper bound on charge .",
    "if we take self - gravity into account , however , there is maximum charge @xmath0 ( or maximum energy @xmath6 ) , at which stability changes , regardless of models . * in flat spacetime , in some models such as the ad gauge - mediated model @xcite , there is nonzero minimum charge @xmath7 , where q - balls with @xmath8 are nonexistent .",
    "if we take self - gravity into account , however , there exist stable q - balls with arbitrarily small mass and charge .",
    "the above properties of gravitating solitons hold for general models of q - balls and boson stars as long as the leading order term of the potential is a positive mass term in its maclaurin series .",
    ".comparison of maximum and minimum charge ( or gravitational mass ) for flat q - balls , gravitating q - balls and boson stars . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     theoretically the charge @xmath1 is a free parameter , and phenomenologically it could increase by charge accumulation .",
    "therefore , a natural question could arise : what happens to q - balls if @xmath1 is close to @xmath0 ? in this paper",
    "we shall investigate what happens if we give perturbations to equilibrium q - balls with @xmath2 .",
    "in connection with this question , matsuda @xcite claimed that inflation occurs in the core of a q - ball if @xmath1 is large enough .",
    "he assumed a kind of hybrid potential . in his scenario inflation",
    "takes place when the gravity - mediated term , [ ad ] v()^2 , dominates , where @xmath9 is the gravitino mass , @xmath10 term a one - loop correction , and @xmath11 the renormalization scale . if this scenario is true , it would have an important implication for inflationary models .",
    "therefore , the present study is also important as a close examination of this scenario .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review previous results of gravitating q - balls in the ad gravity - mediated model . in sec .",
    "iii we make analytic discussions on general properties of q - ball equilibrium solutions . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss whether q - ball inflation can take place . in sec .",
    "v we present dynamical field equations and our computing method . in sec .",
    "vi , by analyzing the dynamical field equations , we investigate what happens if @xmath1 is so large in the ad gravity - mediated model . sec .",
    "vii is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "to begin with , we review previous results of equilibrium solutions of gravitating q - balls in the ad gravity - mediated model ( [ ad ] ) @xcite .",
    "consider an so(2)-scalar field @xmath12 coupled to einstein gravity .",
    "the action is given by [ sg ] s = d^4x \\{r16g-12g^__-v ( ) } , where @xmath13 .",
    "we assume a spherically symmetric and static spacetime , [ metric ] ds^2=-^2(r)dt^2+a^2(r)dr^2+r^2(d^2+^2d^2 ) , and homogeneous phase rotation , [ phase ] ( t , r)=(r)(t , t ) .",
    "then the field equations become [ gtt ] -r a^32g^t_t&&a+a2r(a^2 - 1 ) + & = & 4gr a^3(^22a^2 + ^2 ^ 22 ^ 2+v ) , + [ grr ] r2g_rr&&+2r(1-a^2 ) + & = & 4gra^2 ( ^22a^2+^2 ^ 22 ^ 2-v ) , + [ box ] a^2 & &  + ( 2r+-aa) + ( a)^2 + & = & a^2dvd .",
    "the boundary conditions are given by [ bc ] & & (0)=()=a(0)=(0)=0,&&a(0)=()=1 .",
    "the charge and the hamiltonian energy are defined by @xcite [ q ] q&&d^3xg^0(_1__2-_2__1 ) , e&&_rr^22ga = m_s2 , [ h]where @xmath14 is the schwarzschild mass . to perform numerical calculations , we rescale the relevant quantities as & & ,  mt ,   mr  ,   gm^2 , & & q ,  e.    figure 1 shows existing domain of equilibrium solutions for @xmath15 in the @xmath1-@xmath16 space . in the case of flat spacetime ( @xmath17 ) no upper bound on @xmath1 or @xmath16 appears and all the solutions in this figure are stable  @xcite . in the case of @xmath18 ,",
    "on the other hand , there appears a cusp @xmath19 , which corresponds to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the lower branch represents stable solutions , while the upper branch unstable ones .    in flat spacetime equilibrium solutions",
    "exist only if @xmath22 .",
    "if we take self - gravity into account , however , equilibrium solutions also exist even if @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the solutions for @xmath24 have been known as mini - boson stars  @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows existing domain of these equilibrium solutions in the @xmath1-@xmath16 space .",
    "the result is similar to that for @xmath22 .",
    "there appears a cusp , which corresponds to @xmath20 and @xmath21 , due to gravity .",
    "the lower branch represents stable solutions , while the upper branch unstable ones .",
    "one may wonder what happens to equilibrium solutions if @xmath25 is so large . in the case of topological defects , static solutions are nonexistent if the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field is close to the planck mass , and the defects expand exponentially instead @xcite . by analogy with this topological inflation , one may conjecture that q - ball equilibrium solutions are nonexistent if @xmath25 is larger than some critical value of order one .    to examine this conjecture , for the case of @xmath15",
    ", we analyze equilibrium solutions with @xmath26 and 10000 , too .",
    "we show the existing domains of the equilibrium solutions in fig .",
    "contrary to the above expectation , we find that equilibrium solutions exist even if @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "3(a ) indicates [ kappae ] _ max = constant , where @xmath28 denotes the maximum energy for each @xmath25 . because the schwarzschild mass of a q - ball is given by @xmath29 @xcite , the relation ( [ kappae ] ) means @xmath30constant .",
    "therefore , as long as ( [ kappae ] ) is satisfied , we expect that static regular solutions can exist .    to confirm this argument , we present one of the metric functions @xmath31 of the extremal solutions with @xmath28 in fig .  3(b ) . all configurations of @xmath31",
    "are virtually the same , which is consistent with ( [ kappae ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that equilibrium solutions exist no matter how large @xmath25 is .",
    "our interest is perturbation of equilibrium solutions with @xmath2 . before analyzing their evolution , however",
    ", it is important to understand general properties of equilibrium solutions .    in the case of flat spacetime",
    ", the field equation is given by [ feqball ] ",
    "+ 2r+^2=dvd .",
    "this is equivalent to the field equation for a single static scalar field with a potential @xmath32 .",
    "if one regards the radius @xmath33 as time  and the scalar amplitude @xmath34 as the position of a particle , one can understand q - ball solutions in words of newtonian mechanics , as shown in fig .",
    "[ newton ] .",
    "equation ( [ feqball ] ) describes a one - dimensional motion of a particle under the conserved force due to the potential  @xmath35 and the time - dependent friction @xmath36 .",
    "if one chooses the initial position  @xmath37 appropriately , the static particle begins to roll down the potential slope , climbs up and approaches the origin over infinite time . because of the energy loss by the friction term in newtonian mechanics , one finds -v_=^2",
    "^ 22-v>0  at   r0 .",
    "dominance of the kinetic energy over the potential energy in the core is one of the important properties of q - balls , as we shall discuss below .",
    "we can extend the above argument to gravitating q - balls by redefining the effective potential as @xmath38  @xcite . in this case , because the potential of a particle  is time - dependent , the above explanation in newtonian mechanics can not apply . however , because @xmath39 is an increasing function , the potential  @xmath35 decreases as time .",
    "this means that some of the mechanical energy  is lost by this variation of the potential  as well as by the friction terms .",
    "therefore , we obtain the relation , [ kindom ] -v_=^2 ^ 22 ^ 2-v>0  at   r0 . we have confirmed that the inequality ( [ kindom ] ) holds for all our numerical solutions .",
    "the condition ( [ kindom ] ) is important because from it we can draw a general conclusion that the q - ball core is attractive as follows . because the regularity condition at @xmath40 is given by ( [ bc ] )",
    ", we can expand the metric functions as ( r)=(0)(1+(r ) ) ,   a(r)=1+f(r ) , with the boundary conditions ( 0)=(0)=f(0)=f(0)=0 . in the vicinity of @xmath40 we can expand the geodesic equations and the einstein equations up to first order of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which yields [ geodesic ] 1(0)^2d^2rdt^2=-&at&r0 , + [ poisson ] ",
    "= 8g3(0)(^2 ^ 2(0)^2-v ) & at&r0 .",
    "note that we have not introduced the weak - gravity approximation .",
    "equations ( [ geodesic ] ) and ( [ poisson ] ) correspond to an equation of motion and poisson equation , respectively , in newtonian mechanics .",
    "they lead to @xmath43 at @xmath44 . furthermore , because of the boundary condition @xmath45 , one finds @xmath46 at @xmath44 , that is , the core region is attractive .",
    "it was argued that inflation can take place in the core of a q - ball if @xmath1 evolves with time by absorbing other q - balls and becomes large enough @xcite . in the last section , however , we showed that q - balls have attractive nature , which indicates that q - ball inflation is improbable . here",
    "we shall discuss this issue more explicitly .",
    "inflation , or accelerated expansion of a local region , is defined by the following conditions .    1 .",
    "some local region is well - approximated by the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker metric , [ flrw ] ds^2=-d^2+a()^2\\{d^2+^2(d^2+^2 ^ 2)}. 2 .",
    "@xmath47 in this region .",
    "3 .   the volume of this local region increases .",
    "if any of these conditions are violated , we can not say that inflation takes place .",
    "the two expressions ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ flrw ] ) look very different . in the case of topological inflation , however , the core of a topological defect is described by de sitter spacetime , ^2=a^-2=1-h^2r^2 ,   ae^h . which assures us of consistence between the two expressions .",
    "if q - balls also trigger inflation , the core of the equilibrium solutions should be well - approximated by ( [ flrw ] ) .    here , under the assumption that the first condition is satisfied for the equilibrium solutions , we discuss whether the second condition is satisfied .",
    "the einstein equations for the doublet scalar field yield [ ddotaq ] d^2ad^2=8ga3(-|dd|^2+v ) .",
    "although the relation between the two coordinate sets , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , is not given explicitly , we find @xmath50 at the center ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "then we can rewrite eq.([ddotaq ] ) as [ ddotaq2 ] d^2ad^2=8ga3(-^2 ^ 2(0)^2+v )  at   r0 . because @xmath52 from ( [ kindom ] ) , we find @xmath53 in the core . unless we give so large perturbation that @xmath54 is more than double , @xmath55 remains negative .",
    "if we chose initial values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 arbitrary , the right - hand side of ( [ ddotaq ] ) might be positive .",
    "however , if the initial configuration is far from that of the equilibrium solution , such inflation can not be called q - ball inflation .",
    "we should also note that we have not specified @xmath1 and a potential type @xmath4 .",
    "we therefore conclude that q - ball inflation can not take place by charge accumulation regardless of @xmath1 and a potential type .",
    "although we have shown that inflation can not take place even if @xmath58 , it is still unclear what happens in this case . to address this question , we have to solve dynamical field equations . here , in preparation for this , we present dynamical field equations and our computing method .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric and dynamical spacetime , [ metric2 ] ds^2=-^2(t , r)dt^2+a^2(t , r)dr^2+r^2(d^2+^2d^2 ) .",
    "introducing dimensionless auxiliary variables , [ hojo ] & & = ( _ 1 ,  _ 2 ) ,   = ( _ 1 ,  _ 2 ) ,  & & a ,  with   , we write down the field equations derived from the action ( [ sg ] ) as [ hc ] -a^2g^t_t&&4aa(r^2)+a(1+a ) & = & 8g(2 + 2r^2+a^2v ) , + [ mc ] rag_tr&&a=8 g , + [ grr2 ] rg_rr&&-ra(1+a)2 & = & 2r(2 + 2r^2-a^2v ) , + [ sfe ] a & & -+4r^2(r^2)(a ) + 6a&=&advd .",
    "we have regularized the dynamical equations at the center , in the sense that all of them contain no diverging term like @xmath59 .    as for initial conditions , we assume a(0,r)=(a=)0 , and the perturbed field configuration , [ initial ] ( 0,r)=(_0(r)+(r ) ,  0 ) ,  ( 0,r)=(0 ,  _",

    "in the analysis method devised in the last section , we shall discuss what happens to q - balls with the potential ( [ ad ] ) if @xmath1 is so large . because ordinary q - balls exist only if @xmath22 , we concentrate on the case of @xmath22 . specifically , we analyze dynamical field equations by giving perturbations to equilibrium solutions @xmath86 and @xmath87 in fig .  3 .",
    "first , we consider perturbation of a stable solution @xmath19 .",

    "( b ) shows the time - variation of @xmath89 , which indicates that the field continues to vibrate around the equilibrium configuration .",
    "these results assure us that stable solutions indicated by energetics or by catastrophe theory are really stable .",
    "the mean values of @xmath90 for the two solutions are slightly different from each other because @xmath1 is slightly changed by the perturbed field @xmath61 .    secondly , we consider perturbation of an unstable solution @xmath91 .",
    "we give two types of perturbations .",
    "figure 6 shows the case of positive perturbation , @xmath92 .",
    "( a ) indicates that the field @xmath93 diverges in the center .",
    "( b ) tells us that @xmath66 approaches to zero and @xmath19 diverges . in the coordinate system ( [ metric ] ) this behavior means a black hole is formed .",
    "figure 7 shows the case of negative perturbation , @xmath94 .",
    "we find that the q - ball diffuses most of mass and charge but not all .",
    "it becomes a thick - wall q - ball with much smaller charge .",
    "thirdly , we consider perturbation of the extremal solution @xmath87 with @xmath0 . again",
    ", we give two types of perturbations .",
    "figure 8 shows the case of positive perturbation , @xmath92 . like",
    "the unstable solution @xmath91 , this q - ball collapses and becomes a black hole .",
    "figure 9 shows the case of negative perturbation , @xmath94 .",
    "the behavior in this situation is not analogous to that for @xmath91 in fig .",
    "the q - ball continues to oscillate without diffusing mass or charge .",
    "the above results are also seen even if we take other values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 as long as they are not so large .",
    "finally , we ascertain that the dynamics is virtually unchanged even if we choose @xmath97 .",
    "figure 10 shows an example of the dynamical solutions , where except for @xmath25 the parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "we see that the q - ball collapses and becomes a black hole in the same way as in fig .",
    "thus our numerical analysis has provided confirmation of our analytic argument that inflation can not take place in the core of a q - ball .",
    "furthermore , it indicates that the extremal solution and unstable solutions near it are critical solutions of black - hole formation @xcite .",
    "in fact , this critical phenomenon was already found for mini - boson stars ( @xmath24 in the model ( [ ad ] ) by hawley and choptuik @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable that q - balls with @xmath22 and with @xmath24 share the same property in the case that @xmath3 , or gravitational effects are so large .",
    "we have addressed a question of what happens to q - balls if @xmath1 is close to @xmath0 .",
    "first , without specifying a model , we have shown analytically that the core of an equilibrium q - ball has attractive nature and inflation can not take place there .",
    "next , for the affleck - dine model , we have analyzed perturbation of equilibrium solutions with @xmath2 by numerical analysis of dynamical field equations .",
    "we have found that the extremal solution with @xmath3 and unstable solutions around it are  critical solutions \" , which means the threshold of black - hole formation .",
    "specifically , for initial data ( [ initial ] ) with ( [ perturbation ] ) , a black - hole is formed if @xmath98 . if @xmath99 , a black hole is not formed , and there are two types of evolutions .",
    "if the initial configuration is very close to the extremal q - ball with @xmath3 , the q - ball continues to oscillate without diffusing mass or charge . in other cases , the q - ball diffuses most of mass and charge , and becomes a thick - wall q - ball with much smaller charge .",

    "<S> in the system of a gravitating q - ball , there is a maximum charge @xmath0 inevitably , while in flat spacetime there is no upper bound on @xmath1 in typical models such as the affleck - dine model . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically the charge @xmath1 is a free parameter , and phenomenologically it could increase by charge accumulation . </S>",
    "<S> we address a question of what happens to q - balls if @xmath1 is close to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> first , without specifying a model , we show analytically that inflation can not take place in the core of a q - ball , contrary to the claim of previous work . </S>",
    "<S> next , for the affleck - dine model , we analyze perturbation of equilibrium solutions with @xmath2 by numerical analysis of dynamical field equations . we find that the extremal solution with @xmath3 and unstable solutions around it are  critical solutions \" , which means the threshold of black - hole formation . </S>"
