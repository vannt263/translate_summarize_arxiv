    "high velocity interactions among different astrophysical media due to collective plasma effects on length scales much smaller than the mean free paths for particle collisions are commonly referred to as collisionless shocks . for extensive reviews ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "these shocks have been suggested to account for a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena ranging from the earth s weak bow shock to strong shocks in supernova remnants ( snrs ) . despite elaborate theoretical investigations ,",
    "the detailed physics of collisionless shocks is far from being understood , mostly because direct observations or physical measurements of these shocks are notoriously difficult due to the extremely small size scales on which they occur .",
    "the extended x - ray emission in planetary nebulae ( pns ) is most commonly explained by a ( reverse ) shock driven into the fast wind expelled by the central star as it collides with the earlier slow and massive wind ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "high angular resolution x - ray images of pns seem to support this notion as the x - ray gas referred to generally as the hot bubble appears confined to the interior of the optical and ir nebula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the low x - ray temperatures and observed luminosities can not be explained by the present day wind velocities and mass loss rates .",
    "this perhaps suggests that the x - rays are due to the fast wind ejected during the early - pn phase or late post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) phase , when the rapidly evolving wind was slower ( @xmath7 500  km  s@xmath1 ) and its mass loss rate was higher than what it is today @xcite .",
    "alternatively , conduction of heat from the fast wind to the slow wind has been invoked to explain the observed low x - ray temperatures @xcite . in that case",
    ", it would be the nebular gas evaporating into the hot bubble that emits the x - rays .",
    "the fast pn wind running into the denser and slower nebular gas leads to relatively slow shocks ( @xmath8 30  km  s@xmath1 ) propagating in this dense gas . in a few cases ,",
    "the morphology of the pns suggest that the fast wind is at least mildly collimated @xcite .",
    "high resolution x - ray spectroscopy of pns is particularly challenging owing to the low x - ray flux from these sources .",

    "the elements c and ne appear to be particularly enriched with respect to solar abundances ( c / o  @xmath9 30 , ne / o  @xmath9 4 ) , while fe and n are deficient ( fe / o  @xmath9 0.2 , n / o  @xmath9 0.4 ) .",
    "in fact , these abundances found in the x - ray plasma closely trace the abundances measured directly from the wind of the present - day wc central star of bd+30@xmath43639  indicating that the x - rays do indeed originate from the fast wind , while evaporation of nebular - composition gas and possibly also conduction of heat to the surrounding nebula have no observable effect @xcite .",

    "fe l - shell lines , often the best temperature indicators , are in fact not clearly identified in the spectrum due to the low fe abundance .",
    "the best remaining temperature indicators are the line ratios of o viii to o vii and of ne x to ne ix , which require here two non - degenerate temperature components of @xmath38160  ev and @xmath38 260  ev .",
    "the two temperatures likely represent a continuous temperature distribution in the hot bubble . for the case of a spherical wind , these range from the hottest inner region right behind the reverse shock , to the cooler , previously heated , more extended regions near the contact discontinuity ( cd ) that are still much hotter than the few - ev outer nebula ( see , e.g. , figs . 1 & 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "much lower temperatures ( @xmath39 100  ev ) are usually difficult to constrain from x - ray spectra , as the emissivities of most bright x - ray lines decrease strongly at these low temperatures . this problem is augmented here by the significant photoelectric absorption ( @xmath40 ) toward bd+30@xmath43639  and by the decreasing letgs throughput with decreasing energy .",

    "moreover , if a narrow rrc is present in the spectrum , it too would be confused at low resolution with n  vii ly@xmath34 and would lead to a further overestimate of the n abundance .",
    "other potential candidate lines around 25.30    include the emission lines of l - shell ions of mid - z elements such as si , s , ar , and ca .",
    "the l - shell ions of s have no bright emission lines between 25   26  @xmath46 @xcite and neither does si ( lepson et  al . in preparation ) .",

    "ar  xvi has equally bright lines at 24.87 and 23.53   , neither of which is observed in the present spectrum .",
    "no other ar ion has bright lines between 25   26   .",
    "our atomic computations show that ne - like ca  xi has a 2p-4d line at 25.38   .",
    "however , a ca  xi 2p-3d line at least five times as strong is predicted at 30.47   , and should be accompanied by the bright 2p-3s lines at 35.65 , 35.67 , and 35.79   , none of which are observed in the spectrum . given the extremely non - solar abundances",
    "observed in some pns , we also checked the spectrum of sc .",
    "o - like sc  xiv turns out to have a relatively bright 2p-3s line at 25.39   .",
    "however again , stronger lines of sc  xiv that are not observed are expected based on our computations ( e.g. , a 2p-3d line at 22.95   ) , as are lines of other l - shell sc charge states .",
    "charge exchange ( ce ) is another process that typically enhances high order lines when highly charged ions mix with neutral atoms . in the context of astrophysical shocks ,",
    "unshocked neutral atoms can easily penetrate the cd ( electro)magnetic barrier and mix with the hot gas . if the enhancement is in sufficiently highly excited levels of c  vi ( @xmath47 ) , the resulting lines could hypothetically fall below 25.5    and would not be resolved from the c  vii rrc in the letgs spectrum",
    ". however , there are two strong arguments against such ce taking place in bd+30@xmath43639 .",
    "first , the uv radiation from the central star maintains high ionization ( e.g. , o  iii ) in the inner parts of the cool nebular gas just outside the cd .",
    "both bd+30@xmath43639  and its sister pn ngc  40 feature stratification in ionization , in which the innermost regions of the optical nebula , just outside the hot bubble , are the most highly ionized @xcite . observations ( and an estimate of the ionization parameter @xmath48 ) imply that the fraction of neutral species available for ce with the x - ray ions is less than @xmath49 .",
    "the second argument against ce in bd+30@xmath43639  is that in order to produce an enhanced spectral signature below 25.5   , the ionization potential of the neutral atom would need to be ridiculously low ( @xmath50 2  ev , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this immediately rules out all of the abundant elements in bd+30@xmath43639  including he , c , o , and ne ( as well as h ) by a large margin and essentially all other elements as well .",
    "an intriguing possibility is ce with dust grains .",
    "dust grains can survive uv charging and may have low ionization energies ( i.e. , work functions ) , which could be of the order of a few ev .",
    "indeed , @xcite found evidence of silicate grains in bd+30@xmath43639  on scales of @xmath51 that coincide with the diameter of the x - ray determined cd .",
    "however , at the corresponding distance of @xmath52  cm from the central star , the grains inevitably are positively charged by more than a few elementary charges ( @xmath53 ) as can be inferred from the work of @xcite .",
    "this completely reduces the cross section for ce with positive ( c  vii ) ions . in short ,",
    "we deem the ce process as highly unlikely to produce the emission around 25.30   .",
    "all of this leads us to the conclusion that the 25.30    emission feature must be the rrc of c  vii recombining to form c  vi .",
    "fluxed best - fit spectral model for bd+30@xmath43639 .",
    "the small contributions of c  vii recombination with cool electrons ( as well as the upper limit for the c vi rrc - dashed line ) compared with the strong line emission originating predominantly from hot gas demonstrate how hard it is to detect recombination from ions crossing cd surfaces in astrophysical shocks and how the extremely high c abundance of bd+30@xmath43639  ( @xmath54 ) is crucial for the present detection . ]",
    "the narrow width of the rrc , which is a direct measure of the electron energy distribution in the plasma , indicates that recombination occurs with electrons of a few ev , two orders of magnitude colder than those required to ionize carbon to its c  vii state . in order to measure the exact recombining - electron temperature",
    ", we used the xspec _ redge _ model , which employs the flux density profile    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the total photon flux in the rrc , @xmath29 corresponds to the temperature in ev of recombining electrons , @xmath57 electron energy ) is the photon energy , and @xmath58 is the ionization potential of the recombined ion .",

    "the upper limit on @xmath29 is robust as the maximum width of the rrc is tightly constrained by the data .",
    "conversely , the lower limit is not as well determined due to the rrc being just broader than the instrumental line spread function expected from the extended angular size of bd+30@xmath43639 . at the distance of bd+30@xmath43639 , @xmath62=1.2  kpc @xcite",

    "one might think that plasma instability around shocks could entail rapid radiative cooling in which ionized atoms recombine with cool electrons .",

    "16 therein ) , which rules out instability and rapid cooling as the origin of the rrcs . in principle",
    ", adiabatic expansion could produce rrcs if it is sufficiently rapid that ions do not have time to recombine before the plasma cools to a few ev , that is , `` ionization freezing '' . in reality",
    ", this is unlikely .",
    "the expansion time depends on the geometry , but the confined geometry of the hot bubble by the dense nebula does not favor such rapid expansion . during the expansion , due to the adiabatic relation @xmath90 , and since recombination rates ( eq . [ trec ] ) scale as @xmath91 , recombination would preferentially occur during the hot , dense phases and not during the low - density phases when the plasma cools down to a few ev . hence , it would not produce the observed narrow rrcs .",
    "moreover , for the hot gas to cool from 100  ev to 1  ev , its density would have to decrease by a factor of 1000 .",
    "consequently , in order to produce the observed emission measure of the rrc ( @xmath92 ) , the size of the source would have to be more than two orders of magnitude larger than the hot bubble , which can be ruled out . a transient ionizing scenario ,",
    "as expected for shocked gas , can not produce rrcs either , although the initial ion temperature would be much higher than the electron temperature .",
    "this is because electron impact ionization _ follows _ electron heating .",
    "even if one invokes a yet - unspecified mechanism to ionize the hot atoms ( up to c  vii ) before the electrons heat up , the collisions of cold electrons with hot ions much more efficiently heat the electrons than result in recombination .",
    "we conclude that the most plausible physical origin of the observed rrcs is highly charged species that are heated and ionized in the hot bubble ( @xmath93 100  ev ) and then interact with much cooler electrons ( @xmath94 a few ev ) in a distinct medium .",
    "the most obvious reservoir of cool electrons lies in the cold nebula , where typical temperatures indeed correspond to a few ev .",
    "the nebula is photoionized by the central uv source , so unbound electrons are abundant . the observed recombination can take place , therefore , if ions from the hot bubble cross the cd plane and penetrate the slow wind where the cool electrons reside . in the simplified hot bubble picture ,",
    "the outer part of the hot bubble is also its densest and relatively coolest region ( for the spherically symmetric case see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this picture is consistent with the lowest charge states in the hot bubble crossing the cd and recombining , as the spectrum seems to suggest .",
    "the narrow rrc and the consequential limits on intermediate temperatures should help constrain the role of heat conduction by electrons as well as the role of nebular evaporation into the hot bubble .",
    "heat conduction by electrons can be suppressed even by magnetic fields as weak as 0.1@xmath95 g @xcite .",
    "the viability of such magnetic fields has not been established , but if they do exist , they could preserve the steep temperature gradient across the cd required to produce a narrow rrc .",
    "the length scales for such a gradient are of the order of the electron larmor radius , while the larmor radius for ions can be much larger . for particles with mass @xmath96 and charge @xmath97 at a temperature @xmath69 ,",

    "as seen above , the width of the rrc can provide a tight constraint on the electron temperature on the nebular side of the cd .",
    "it would also be useful to measure the temperature of the hot plasma close to the cd , but just on its hot side .",
    "this temperature can be readily obtained from the limit on the recombination rate of c  vi . in a steady state ,",

    "nevertheless , we note that the temperature profiles of @xcite at the outer edge of the conduction front do appear to sustain a sharp temperature drop by approximately two orders of magnitude ( see their fig .",

    "the observed recombination rates appear to be consistent with the scenario of shocked hot bubble gas penetrating the slow wind , and with the theoretical models and numerical simulations of such a scenario .    of course , the assumption of spherical symmetry in these models and in eq .",
    "( [ nion ] ) is probably an oversimplification .",
    "collimated fast winds would imply higher densities .",
    "furthermore , the simplified picture that only includes crossing of hot ions to the cool side must be incomplete as it would breach the plasma neutrality and would very quickly induce a strong electric field that would inhibit further ion crossings .",
    "hence , there must be a reverse - charge current , for example of electrons following the ions , or nebular ions entering the hot bubble .",

    "the penetration of the stellar - wind from the hot bubble deep into the nebula is a different effect from nebular evaporation , although both processes similarly defy the simplified notion of stark disparity in composition between the two media .",
    "in contrast with the chemical composition , however , the temperature disparity does appear to preserve the discontinuous nature of the interface .",
    "the present discovery of a narrow carbon rrc in a pn shock is possible owing not only to the cold , yet ionized gas of the ambient nebula , but also to the extremely high c abundance in the stellar - wind and the hot bubble .",
    "it would be natural to suppose , however , that hot ions crossing the cd should be a more general phenomenon of stellar - wind shocks .",
    "indeed , we found two more cases of narrow rrcs in hot plasma sources : both are colliding wind binaries with a c - rich wolf - rayet ( wr ) star and an o star companion : @xmath166  velorum  and @xmath167  muscae .",
    "@xmath166  velorum  is a wc8+o7.5 stellar binary system , which like bd+30@xmath43639  ( wc9 ) is highly enriched in c , o , and ne .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of c  vii and c  vi rrcs in the x - ray spectrum of @xmath166  velorum , and upper limits to the rrcs of oxygen ions .",
    "similar to bd+30@xmath43639 , the observed recombining gas in @xmath166  velorum  reflects the wr chemical composition . in the binary case ,",

    "the electron temperature of the c  vii rrc measured by @xcite is @xmath168  ev , consistent with that of an unshocked o star or wr wind .",
    "the rrcs in @xmath166  velorum  persist when the thick wr wind absorbs the inner , hot x - ray components implying that they originate downstream from the stagnation point along the shock front ( e.g. , region 3 in fig .",
    "9 of * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite speculated that the narrow rrcs could be due to cold plasma in extended regions of the wind , photoionized by hard x - rays from the hot wind - collision region .",
    "however , they also noted significant problems in finding a model that can account for both the high ionization parameter required to photoionize c to its highest charge state ( suggestive of low density ) and the high emission measure of the recombining plasma ( high density ) .",
    "@xcite also raised the possibility that recombination may occur following adiabatic cooling of the shocked gas .",
    "as discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] , this would require the ( adiabatic ) dynamical times to be considerably shorter than the recombination times , which is highly unlikely in a dense stellar - wind .",
    "using the parameters of @xcite , we estimate the density 1  au away from the wr star to be @xmath169 , which implies c  vii recombination times of @xmath170  s ( for @xmath171  ev ) .",
    "adiabatic expansion times are harder to estimate without knowing the geometry , but the dynamical time it takes plasma that cools down to @xmath172  ev ( @xmath173  km  s@xmath1 ) to expand to say @xmath91  au is roughly 10@xmath174  s @xmath175 . as in the pn case discussed in  3 ,",
    "if the hot gas expands and cools from @xmath176  ev to a few ev , the density would have decreased by a factor of @xmath177 .",
    "this would require an enormous volume to produce the observed rrcs .",
    "we suggest alternatively that the rrcs in @xmath166  velorum , in analogy with the case of bd+30@xmath43639 , are due to highly ionized c atoms that were shocked in the wr wind , crossed the cd surface , and interacted with unshocked electrons of the much cooler , yet also ionized plasma from the o star wind .",
    "the high carbon abundance of the wr wind , as opposed to the much lower abundance in the o  star wind , suggests that the hot ions must come from the wr side .",
    "the wind from the o star is also shocked ( and hot ) close to the stagnation point and therefore this hot - wr - ions / cold - o - electrons interface must exist farther away along the bow as @xcite inferred from observations .",
    "@xcite identified narrow c  vii and o  viii rrcs in the x - ray spectrum of another colliding - wind binary , @xmath167  muscae , a wc6+o9.5 system fairly similar to @xmath166  velorum .",
    "they suggested the possibility of ions escaping the bow shock layer and interacting with the wind , but provided no further discussion .",
    "again , we suggest the cool recombining gas interacting with the highly ionized plasma in @xmath167  muscae  be interpreted as evidence for shock heated plasma in the metal - rich wr wind crossing the cd and mixing with the cooler o star wind .",
    "the bright rrcs in the two stellar binary systems and in bd+30@xmath43639  suggest this kind of mixing and perhaps other microphysical processes around the cd are common to stellar - wind shocks in different systems ranging in size from @xmath178  cm in stellar binaries to @xmath179  cm in pns .",
    "the high c abundance in these sources obviously facilitates the detection of the rrcs of c  vii and c  vi , which are relatively isolated in the spectrum .",
    "o rrcs are harder to identify unambiguously owing to blending with fe l - shell lines .",
    "we suspect , nonetheless , that the observed rrcs are traces of shocked plasma crossing the cd irrespective of element biases .",
    "an interesting question is whether similar cd crossing takes place in young shell - like snrs and whether it leaves a measurable signature that can give an idea of the temperature jump across the cd , as it does in bd+30@xmath43639  and in the colliding binary winds .",
    "the fast stellar - wind colliding with the pn is qualitatively analogous to the sn ejecta slamming into the circumstellar material in young snrs .",
    "however , due to the high velocity of the sn explosion and the low density of the circumstellar gas , temperatures on _ both _ sides of the cd , heated by the forward and reverse shocks , are both expected to be high ( @xmath180 100  ev and possibly much higher ) .",
    "additionally , the immediate region around the cd represents the oldest shocked plasma , so the electrons that were initially cool have had time to equilibrate with the hotter protons .",
    "consequently , ions crossing the cd would not produce a narrow rrc even if they recombine .",
    "moreover , unlike in pns , the influence of strong magnetic fields on the cd in snrs is not in doubt , as indicated by radio synchrotron emission from thin filaments attributed to the cd region . the interstellar magnetic field , and in particular its tangential component",
    ", can be enhanced by a factor of a few at the cd due to field compression by simple charge advection @xcite , or by up to two orders of magnitude due to hydrodynamical instabilities @xcite .",
    "these fields are more than sufficient to sustain the temperature jump and perhaps even to totally suppress ion crossing . by substituting a magnetic field of 100  @xmath95 g and a density of 1  @xmath18 into equations .",
    "( [ taul ] ) and ( [ taus ] ) , one easily sees that a thermal ion gyrating across the cd of a snr will spend far too little time on the cool side of the cd ( @xmath181 seconds ) in order for it to significantly cool down and remain on the other side ( @xmath182 days ) , even if cool electrons were present .",
    "indeed , the highest quality published x - ray grating spectra ( especially beyond 25   ) of young snrs do not appear to feature detectable narrow rrc emission @xcite . we therefore conclude that narrow rrcs due to ion crossing of the cd are likely a unique signature of relatively slow shocks in dense stellar - wind sources .",
    "bd+30@xmath43639   was observed with _ chandra _  letgs for a total of 300  ks providing the first and so far only high - resolution x - ray spectrum of a pn .",
    "as already shown by @xcite , the spectrum can be fitted by an absorbed , two - temperature plasma model , though it likely represents a distribution of temperatures between @xmath9100  300 ev .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by c , ne , and o emission lines with very little n and fe .",
    "the carbon abundance is particularly high , indicating that the x - ray gas primarily originates from the present - day wc stellar - wind and making the c emission features most suitable for detailed analysis .",
    "we detect in the spectrum a narrow rrc of bare c  vii forming c  vi by recombination with cool ( @xmath183  ev ) electrons .",
    "we suspect that a bright rrc of h - like c  vi forming c  v also appears in the spectrum , but the low s / n of that feature allows only an upper limit to its flux .",
    "we interpret the rrcs as direct evidence of penetration of hot , highly ionized plasma into the cool nebula past the cd , which separates the heated fast wind from the slow wind .",
    "this finding requires a steep temperature gradient , as intermediate electron temperatures higher than @xmath184  ev would have broadened the rrc beyond its observed width . using the measured lower limit to the flux ratio of the c  vii and c  vi rrcs",
    ", the temperature difference between the hot and cold plasma across the interface is found to be @xmath6  ev . such a steep gradient can be sustained by magnetic fields , which would significantly suppress heat conduction . on the other hand ,",
    "magnetic fields may not be needed to preserve the sharp temperature drop between the hot bubble and the nebula .",
    "numerical simulations of heat conduction in the literature @xcite do appear to preserve a sharp gradient , though their grid is too coarse to resolve the processes discussed above .",
    "simulations with the appropriate wc - wind composition and at higher resolutions will need to be confronted with the present results in order to quantitatively test the role of magnetic fields in pns .",
    "the measured recombination rate of @xmath185  s@xmath1 implies a mass crossing rate of @xmath186  m@xmath134  yr@xmath1 , which can be a few percent of the total fast - wind mass , implying that the fast - wind gas successfully makes its way through the nebula despite the putative magnetic barrier .",
    "the deep penetration of stellar - wind gas into the optical nebula is indirectly supported by abundance gradients observed in the innermost regions of ngc  40 @xcite .",
    "this picture is quite different from that of nebular evaporation into the hot bubble for which we find no observable sign .",
    "finally , we note two stellar ( wc + o ) binary x - ray sources with similar rrc features . we take this as evidence of the generality of ions crossing cd surfaces in slow , dense stellar - wind shocks , regardless of whether the shock front is on the scales of a massive - star binary system or a pn .",
    "the hotter and more highly magnetized environments of cds in snrs , on the other hand , are less favorable for ion crossing , or for producing narrow rrcs .",

    "<S> x - rays from planetary nebulae ( pns ) are believed to originate from a shock driven into the fast stellar - wind ( @xmath0 1000  km  s@xmath1 ) as it collides with an earlier circumstellar slow wind ( @xmath0 10  km  s@xmath1 ) . in theory , </S>",
    "<S> the shocked fast wind ( hot bubble ) and the ambient cold nebula can remain separated by magnetic fields along a surface referred to as the contact discontinuity ( cd ) that inhibits diffusion and heat conduction . </S>",
    "<S> the cd region is extremely difficult to probe directly owing to its small size and faint emission . </S>",
    "<S> this has largely left the study of cds , stellar - shocks , and the associated microphysics in the realm of theory . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents spectroscopic evidence of ions from the hot bubble ( @xmath2  ev ) crossing the cd and penetrating the cold nebular gas ( @xmath3  ev ) . specifically , a narrow radiative recombination continuum ( rrc ) emission feature is identified in the high resolution x - ray spectrum of the pn bd+30@xmath43639indicating bare c  vii ions recombine with cool electrons at @xmath5  ev . an upper limit to the flux of the narrow rrc of h - like c  vi </S>",
    "<S> is obtained as well . </S>",
    "<S> the rrcs are interpreted as due to c ions from the hot bubble of bd+30@xmath43639  crossing the cd into the cold nebula , where they ultimately recombine with its cool electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the rrc flux ratio of c  vii to c  vi constrains the temperature jump across the cd to @xmath6  ev , providing for the first time direct evidence of the stark temperature disparity between the two sides of an astrophysical cd , and constraining the role of magnetic fields and heat conduction accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> two colliding - wind binaries are noted to have similar rrcs suggesting a temperature jump and cd crossing by ions may be a common feature of stellar - wind shocks . </S>"
