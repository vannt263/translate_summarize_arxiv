    "the presence of ionized material in the interstellar medium ( hereafter , ism ) can be attributed to two distinctive mechanisms .",
    "first , photoionization of the surrounding neutral gas by the strong , energetic ultra - violet ( uv ) flux of nearby massive stars is largely responsible for the detection of the standard hydrogen balmer series , typically used for the morphological and kinematical description of hii regions .",
    "secondly , stellar winds with high terminal velocities and violent supernova blasts are commonly associated with the propagation of transonic and supersonic shock waves in the surrounding medium .",
    "the important increase of the post - shocked gas temperature favors its ionization through shock excitation .",
    "pioneering work by @xcite has compared specific flux ratios for a variety of ionic transitions in the ism optical gas .",
    "this allowed the authors to approximately separate standard hii regions and planetary nebulae ( hereafter , pne ) mostly governed by photoionization from shock - dominated supernova remnants ( hereafter , snrs ) .",
    "these diagnostic diagrams were often used , in literature , to classify large amount of ionized targets in large - scale objects , for example more - or - less distant galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this has led to emission - line ratio plots in which each object is usually statistically represented by a single point .",
    "obviously , intrinsic variations , within a given object , can be investigated by targeting galactic objects individually ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this allows to spatially resolve much smaller ( @xmath70.1 pc ) structures and artifacts characterized by peculiar line ratios that are , otherwise , unrevealed or statistically negligible in observations using poorer angular resolutions .",
    "the investigation of close ionized objects has already revealed that photoionization and shock excitation can both be found in individual regions .",
    "kinematically speaking , standard hii regions encompassing massive stars earlier than o6 have shown little indication of a strong impact on the surrounding gas attributed to stellar winds , referred earlier as a potential source for shock excitation in nebulae .",
    "this remains usually true even when using observations with high spectral resolutions that allow to measure velocity fluctuations down to a few km s@xmath8 .",
    "the main reason for this resides in the double - shock model said to accurately describe the dynamical evolution of wind - blown bubbles @xcite .",
    "the reverse shock quickly ( i.e. , often within less than a spatial element of resolution ) converts high - velocity ( @xmath91000 km s@xmath8 ) terminal winds into low - velocity , high - temperature gas .",
    "the thermal energy of this hot , pressurized material then initiates and fuels the expansion of the dense shell of post - shock ism material found at much greater distances with respect to the central star .",
    "the typical expansion velocity of the shocked shell is usually a few km s@xmath8 above 10 km s@xmath8 , roughly the speed of sound for warm ( @xmath1010000 k ) h@xmath11 gas .",
    "unfortunately , in complex tridimensional geometries , this kind of velocities could be easily confused with standard accelerated outflows in hii regions , such as champagne @xcite or photoevaporated @xcite flows , turbulent motions @xcite or fluid instabilities .",
    "this work mainly explores the possibility of detecting shock waves associated , in particular , to stellar winds using the emissive properties of the ionized gas rather than a more typical , and not always successful , approach based on the information retrieved from radial velocities and non - thermal line widths .",
    "the ic1805 nebula is located in the perseus arm of our galaxy .",
    "the most massive stars of the melotte 15 star cluster are currently responsible for the energetic support of the large hii region .",
    "the south - central portion of the nebula ( see figure 1 ) , in the direct vicinity of the star cluster , is gas - rich and will be used in this work to fill the @xcite diagrams .",
    "our goals are to ( 1 ) obtain reliable , high signal - to - noise ratios ( hereafter , s / n ) , spectra of the optical emission in the brightest portions of the ic1805 star - forming complex , ( 2 ) provide the corresponding series of line - ratio diagnostic diagrams , and ( 3 ) investigate the impact of photoionization and shock excitation in the targeted gas volume .    we present , in @xmath12  2 , the galactic hii region ic1805 and its associated star cluster , melotte 15 . information related to our spectrometric observations and methods used for data reduction are detailed in @xmath12  3",
    ". results of our study and diagnostic diagrams are provided in @xmath12  4 .",
    "interpretation and discussion follow in @xmath12  5 . summarized results and general conclusions will finally be provided in @xmath12  6 .",
    "introduced by @xcite as an irregular nebula of medium brightness , the galactic hii region ic1805 is often referred as the heart nebula due to the heart - shaped morphology of its southern hemisphere ( 60@xmath1328@xmath14@xmath15@xmath16@xmath1562@xmath1310@xmath14 ) .",
    "it is suggested that outflows from the ob association melotte 15 ( @xmath17=02@xmath1832@xmath1945@xmath20 , @xmath16=61@xmath1326@xmath1440@xmath21 ) are responsible for the actual expansion of the large hii region / superbubble @xcite .",
    "proper motion investigation has allowed the identification of 126 stars intrinsic to the star cluster @xcite .",
    "the authors confirmed , through spectroscopic observations , the presence of numerous massive stars ; about forty from spectral types o4 to b2 ( including 10 o - type stars ) have been identified with a high probability of membership .",
    "an important proportion of these massive stars are still found on the main - sequence branch indicating a very young cluster age evaluated at 2.5 myr @xcite .",
    "the dynamical age of the ic1805 nebula being estimated at 14 myr @xcite , it appears that the large hii region was formed and shaped by the mechanical deposit , in the ism , of energy ( i.e. , photon flux , stellar winds , supernovae ) attributed to a succession of different star clusters , melotte 15 being the most recently formed .",
    "no non - thermal emission being actually detected in the large star - forming complex , this suggests that the impact of old supernovae could be negligible in the nebula s current dynamics .",
    "ubv photometry , properly corrected for absorption , puts the melotte 15 complex at an heliocentric distance of 2.35 kpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite provide a high spectral - resolution ( @xmath2215 km s@xmath8 ) kinematical investigation of the h@xmath11 content on an appreciable fraction of the ic1805 ionized extent .",
    "the northernmost portions ( 63@xmath1320@xmath14@xmath15@xmath16@xmath1566@xmath1350@xmath14 ) of the large ovoid bubble have shown kinematical evidences for high - latitude gas venting and the early development of a galactic chimney .",
    "it appears that leaking uv photons , emanating from the melotte 15 star cluster and unabsorbed by the denser low - declination material , may participate in the sustainment of the high - temperature gas found in the galactic halo . in the southern half of the nebula ,",
    "schematically represented in figure 1 , the last residual fragments of an old giant molecular cloud appear to be eroded by the uv flux and stellar winds of the nearby massive stars . as a result ,",
    "series of criss - crossing accelerated flows are detected in agreement with the champagne phase ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ionization fronts , stellar winds , and champagne shocks are therefore expected to have developed in the vicinity of the melotte 15 star cluster .",
    "this could suggest that shock excitation may be responsible for the presence of a certain fraction of the observed ionized material although a well - defined kinematical signature attributed to shock waves has not been formally identified in our previous study .",
    "this will be largely addressed in the following sections .",
    "0.3 cm    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     observations of the ic1805 optical gas complex were performed during the nights of 2008 september 24 - 25 , 25 - 26 using the ritchey - chrtien 1.6 m telescope of the observatoire du mont - mgantic ( omm ) .",
    "the data were gathered using the imaging fourier transform spectrometer spiomm ( spectromtre imageur de lobservatoire du mont mgantic ) . technical details regarding spiomm",
    "are provided in @xcite , @xcite and references therein .    for each pixel of the detector , the instrument has the capacity to obtain the emission spectrum of the corresponding nebular - gas column in selected bandwidths of the optical regime between 3500 @xmath2 and 9000 @xmath2 .",
    "prior to entering the observation mode , the spectral resolution is fixed by the observer between r=1 and 25000 .    for this work",
    ", the use of an interference filter enabled the acquisition of the spectral information in the red portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between 6480 @xmath2 and 6820 @xmath2 .",
    "this allowed to obtain , simultaneously , emission spectra displaying the h@xmath0@xmath16563 @xmath2 , @xmath3nii@xmath4$]@xmath1@xmath16548 , 6584 @xmath2 , and @xmath3sii@xmath4$]@xmath1@xmath16716 , 6731 @xmath2 ionic transitions .",
    "a spectral resolution of r=2100 was judged appropriate corresponding to a resolution of roughly 3 @xmath2 or 150 km s@xmath8 centered on the h@xmath0 rest frequency .",
    "the field - of - view ( fov ) is roughly 12@xmath14@xmath2312@xmath14 while data were spatially binned 2@xmath232 during acquisition to reduce readout times .",
    "the resulting raw data cube is formed , for each pixel , of a discrete interferogram .",
    "following classical data reduction for ccd observations ( i.e. , bias subtraction and flatfield correction ) , all panchromatic images were realigned to correct for guiding errors . according to the photometry of stars located in gas - depleted zones ,",
    "all images were also corrected for variations of the sky transparency occurring during data acquisition .",
    "each interferogram is then fourier transformed and calibrated in velocities using a he - ne laser ( @xmath16328 @xmath2 ) as frequency of reference .",
    "the data were again spatially binned 2@xmath232 during reduction in order to account for the 2@xmath245 seeing measured at the telescope .",
    "the resulting spatial resolution is of 2@xmath242 pixel@xmath8 for 325@xmath23335 pixel@xmath25 . using the adopted distance to melotte 15 ( see @xmath12  2 )",
    ", this corresponds to an angular resolution of 0.026 pc pixel@xmath8 as seen on the plane of the sky .",
    "two cubes were obtained in the vicinity of the melotte 15 star cluster .",
    "the observational parameters for both cubes , labeled east and west , are summarized in table 1 . the heliocentric correction",
    "being very similar for both cubes , the two were mosaicked to a new extended fov of 21@xmath265@xmath2312@xmath265 ( see figure 1 ) and over 200000 emission spectra .",
    "following subtraction of the continuum , a multi - component gaussian fit procedure , written in idl , was applied to the mosaicked cube .",
    "the fitting procedure returns , for each component , the peak intensity in analog - to - digital units ( adu ) , the line centroid ( or velocity ) , and the line dispersion ( @xmath27@xmath28@xmath29 ) .",
    "since this work is mostly based on line ratios , we followed the recommendation of @xcite by imposing a s / n greater than 6 for a given gaussian fit to be usable . for each spectrum ,",
    "the noise level was estimated from continuum fluctuations measured in empty channels .",
    "figure 2 shows a high - quality spectrum obtained in the brightest parts of our mosaicked cube .",
    "this kind of spectrum is typical only for the regions of high emissivity of our fov .",
    "emission - line profiles corresponding to weaker areas are much noisier and complementary lines , found in the wavelength interval covered by the interference filter ( see above ) , such as the @xmath3ni@xmath4$]@xmath16500 @xmath2 and @xmath3hei@xmath4$]@xmath16678 @xmath2 transitions are not discernible from noise fluctuations . the weakest line ( i.e. , @xmath3nii@xmath4$]@xmath16548 @xmath2 ) in the example provided by figure 2 has a s / n of 24 .",
    "figures 3 to 7 provide the monochromatic , peak - intensity maps for all five emission lines investigated in this work .",
    "north is up and east is left in all figures .",
    "figure 8 spectacularly displays the @xmath6\\,\\lambda6584}{\\textnormal{h}{\\alpha}\\,\\lambda6563}$ ] ratio throughout the whole fov ( see caption ) .",
    "red emphasizes regions dominated by h@xmath0 while bluer shades pinpoint a stronger emission of the @xmath3nii@xmath4$]@xmath16584 @xmath2 transition ( with respect to the redder areas ) .",
    "three stars with strong h@xmath0 lines are detected ( the third being barely perceptible very close to the center of the figure ) . at the position of all other stars ,",
    "bad pixels were removed and replaced by mean values statistically representing the surrounding nebular - gas content .",
    "this figure is particularly useful to describe ionized features in our fov .",
    "the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) co(1 - 0 ) survey of the 2@xmath30 galactic quadrant @xcite has revealed very faint emission corresponding to tenuous molecular material at the position of the bright , central ionized structure in figures 3 to 7 .",
    "this suggests the presence of a large molecular fragment , surrounded by the most massive stars of the melotte 15 cluster , that has undergone almost full erosion by the uv flux and stellar winds of the nearby ionizing sources .",
    "figure 8 reveals the filamentary nature of the central structure .",
    "these filaments most likely trace out the spatial disposition , on the plane of the sky , of the eroded ( sometimes fully ionized ) molecular envelopes .",
    "the central structure is surrounded by diffuse ionized material likely associated to photoevaporated flows kinematically in agreement with the champagne phase @xcite .",
    "one of these flows ( displaying blue shades in figure 8) is particularly well - defined , propagating from the bottom - center of our fov approximately toward the upper - left corner of figure 8 . west of the central structure , the spatial arrangement of the nebular gases is extremely complex .",
    "ionized filaments are still perceptible although the contrast with the diffuse surroundings is not as clear . toward the western boundary of figure 8 , even the h@xmath0 emission appears darker , obscured by interstellar dust .",
    "shock excitation in the vicinity of the bright , central ionized structure , displayed in figures 3 to 8 , will be largely discussed and investigated in @xmath12  5.2.1 .    toward the south - eastern portion of our fov , a small co fragment is clearly detected in the fcrao survey at the systemic velocity of the ic1805 region ( see co contours in figures 3 to 7 ) .",
    "its ionized counterpart is revealed by a thin , rounded ionization front especially visible in the lower - left corner of figure 8 ( see also figure 19__a _ _ ) .",
    "this specific shape of the ionization front results from the vast majority of the ionizing sources in melotte 15 being located behind the molecular clump .",
    "this was kinematically confirmed , in @xcite , by the detection of an accelerated ionized outflow moving away from the observer ( see @xmath12  5.2.2.1 ) .",
    "this flow eventually collides or simply coincides in lines - of - sight with the south - central / north - east flow mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "this results in particularly complicated kinematical motions in central ic1805 with h@xmath0 non - thermal line widths approaching the supersonic regime ( @xmath1010 km s@xmath8 ) according to high - resolution observations @xcite .    in the same area of figure 8",
    "( see also figure 19__c _ _ ) , a cylindrical , cigar - like feature appears to be associated with an isolated star with strong h@xmath0 lines ( see above ) .",
    "the feature has bright h@xmath11 and n@xmath11 rims but is almost completely gas - deprived near its center .",
    "this structure as well as the rounded ionization front found in the lower - left corner of figure 8 will be discussed in @xmath12  5.2.2 .",
    "figure 9 was processed identically to figure 8 and displays the @xmath5\\,\\lambda\\lambda6716 , 6731}{[\\textnormal{n}\\,\\textsc{ii}]\\,\\lambda6584}$ ] ratio ( where the numerator is the sum of both lines of the @xmath3sii@xmath4 $ ] doublet ) . again",
    ", blue shades identify nitrogen - rich zones while red areas indicate that a sizeable role is played by sulfur in the overall gas emissivity .",
    "one immediately notices the complexity of the chemical properties in ic1805 .",
    "while @xmath3nii@xmath4 $ ] clearly dominates over @xmath3sii@xmath4 $ ] where h@xmath0 is the brightest , weaker zones ( in h@xmath0 integrated intensity ) show an important increase of the relative contribution of the sulfur material . in particular , the reader s attention is directed toward the north - eastern filament of the bright , central structure described above .",
    "series of small , quasi - circular blobs are found .",
    "the top three reveal two nitrogen - dominated features ( in blue ) and one with a stronger relative contribution in @xmath3sii@xmath4 $ ] ( in red ) .",
    "investigating their corresponding spectrum , the @xmath3sii@xmath4 $ ] intensity remains roughly constant from one blob to another while the @xmath3nii@xmath4 $ ] lines suffer a strong attenuation along the line - of - sight of the `` redder '' one ( which explains the relatively poor contribution of nitrogen towards it ) .",
    "this behavior is not generalized to our whole fov although similar features can be found here and there .",
    "the supernova remnant hb3 ( see figure 1 ) is located too far away from our fov to have had a sizeable impact on the chemical properties in central ic1805 .",
    "alternatively , we can argue that the old , large molecular cloud , that gave birth to melotte 15 roughly 2.5 myr ago , may have had an inhomogeneous distribution of its chemical compounds .",
    "old supernovae in ic1805 , whose non - thermal emission has vanished since , could also be held responsible .",
    "we reiterate that the ic1805 region was most likely formed by a succession of different star clusters ( see @xmath12  2 ) i.e. , although no indication for supernova remnants is currently found inside the large hii region , it is highly probable that the inner zones of ic1805 were , at some time in the past , disturbed by supernova events associated to previous generations of massive stars .",
    "these stars could have had an intrinsic inhomogeneity in their inner nitrogen distribution which eventually led to an anisotropic dispersion of these chemical compounds , products of the cno cycle , as each stellar object reached the end of its life ( e.g. , see the works by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite on the crab nebula ) .",
    "line ratios , in the literature , usually correspond to ratios between two ( or more ) line fluxes . for a given emission line ,",
    "the line flux is proportional to the product between its peak intensity and its width as returned by the gaussian fit . in this work ,",
    "the relatively low spectral resolution used ( see @xmath12  3 ) is roughly a factor 10 to 20 greater than typical non - thermal velocity fluctuations , along the line - of - sight , found in ic1805 using high - resolution observations of the h@xmath11 kinematics @xcite .",
    "hence , in this work , the width of each emission line is entirely dominated by the instrumental response and the returned widths are very similar , from one ion to another , independently of the position in the fov .",
    "therefore , line ratios , in the following discussion , were strictly estimated using returned values for peak intensities while line widths were simply not considered .      to assure the selection of the most reliable emission - line profiles in our sample of over 200000 spectra , a series of conditions are proposed . * all * of them need to be fulfilled otherwise the given spectrum is rejected from the discussion to follow .",
    "the conditions are summarized as follow :    1 .",
    "the profile must show all five lines ( i.e. , h@xmath0@xmath16563 @xmath2 , @xmath3nii@xmath4$]@xmath1@xmath16548 , 6584 @xmath2 , and @xmath3sii@xmath4$]@xmath1@xmath16716 , 6731 @xmath2 ) investigated in this work with reliable s / n above 6 .",
    "two conditions are proposed in order to confirm that the kinematical properties of a given profile are physically acceptable .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath3nii@xmath4$]@xmath16548 @xmath2 and @xmath3nii@xmath4$]@xmath16584 @xmath2 transitions must exhibit identical non - thermal motions since both lines are emitted by the same ions .",
    "the same argument also applies to the @xmath3sii@xmath4$]@xmath16716 @xmath2 and @xmath3sii@xmath4$]@xmath16731 @xmath2 lines .    1 .   first , the difference , in centroid velocities , between both lines of a given doublet ( i.e. , @xmath3nii@xmath4 $ ] or @xmath3sii@xmath4 $ ] ) must not exceed 15 km s@xmath8 .",
    "this corresponds roughly to 1/10th the spectral resolution of our observations ( see @xmath12  3 ) and therefore roughly accounts for the uncertainties on the gaussian fits .",
    "centroid - velocity differences , along a given line - of - sight , between the h@xmath11 , n@xmath11 , and s@xmath11 material are allowed ( and expected ! ) since all three ions are not necessarily co - spatial in central ic1805 .",
    "2 .   secondly , the difference , in measured line widths , between all five components must not exceed 15 km s@xmath8 .",
    "this is expected from all lines being dominated by the instrumental response ( see @xmath12  4.2.1 ) .",
    "if observations with high spectral resolution ( e.g. , of the order of a few km s@xmath8 ) were used here , a condition similar to the previous one ( on centroid velocities ) would have been required ( i.e. , identical line widths , within the uncertainty bars of the gaussian fits , between both lines of a given doublet , @xmath3nii@xmath4 $ ] or @xmath3sii@xmath4 $ ] ) .    finally , specific line ratios of the @xmath3nii@xmath4 $ ] and @xmath3sii@xmath4 $ ] transitions must agree with standard theoretical models of ionized nebulae .",
    "1 .   the computation of the @xmath5\\,\\lambda6716}{[\\textnormal{s}\\,\\textsc{ii}]\\,\\lambda6731}$ ] line ratio must lead to a finite electron density .",
    "the upper and lower uncertainties on the density measurement ( see @xmath12  4.2.3 ) must also be finite .",
    "the computation of the @xmath6\\,\\lambda6584}{[\\textnormal{n}\\,\\textsc{ii}]\\,\\lambda6548}$ ] line ratio must not largely deviate from the theoretical value approaching 3 in low - density regimes typically found for hii regions .",
    "small deviations from 3 are expected ( see @xmath12  4.2.4 ) and explained ( see @xmath12  5.1 ) although values @xmath72 or @xmath314 would seem particularly hard to reconcile with the theory and would therefore demand to be rejected .",
    "all conditions taken in consideration , only 3057 emission - line profiles were retained , most of them being associated to the bright , central structure found in the overlapping region between the eastern and western field ( see @xmath12  5.2.1 ) . obviously , the summation of both cubes largely contributes to increase the data quality for duplicated pixels not only by increasing the peak signal for all lines but also by flattening noise fluctuations in empty channels ( see figure 2 ) .    considering the very large number of emission - line profiles available in our initial data set ( more than 200000 ) ,",
    "we are fully aware that the conditions listed above drastically reduce the size of the retained sample .",
    "on the other hand , these conditions assure that the retained profiles are undoubtedly the most reliable available .",
    "we reiterate that a s / n greater than 6 is required to appropriately conduct an investigation on line ratios .",
    "however , a `` physical detection '' [ of a given line ] is considered when s / n@xmath323 @xcite .",
    "this will be used in a later subsection to investigate notable , although not necessarily reliable , line ratios for particular structures in ic1805 ( see @xmath12  5.2.2.2 ) .",
    "the @xmath5\\,\\lambda6716}{[\\textnormal{s}\\,\\textsc{ii}]\\,\\lambda6731}$ ] line ratios were computed and used as input values for the fivel fortran procedure @xcite adapted , for convenience , in idl . assuming a constant electron temperature of 7400 k throughout ic1805 @xcite , mean electron densities ( @xmath33 ) , in the s@xmath11 ionic volume , were obtained for each nebular - gas column ( i.e. , line - of - sight ) .",
    "since uncertainties can not be recovered from the use of the fivel procedure , error bars on density measurements @xmath33 were computed as follows . for each line of the @xmath3sii@xmath4 $ ] doublet , the uncertainty on the peak intensity , as returned by the gaussian fit procedure , is provided by equation 4__a _ _ of @xcite .",
    "from there , the statistical error on each line ratio is simply provided by the standard propagation of uncertainty . for each ratio , minimal and maximal plausible values",
    "are then easily obtained by respectively subtracting and adding this calculated uncertainty . using these lower and upper limits on @xmath5\\,\\lambda6716}{[\\textnormal{s}\\,\\textsc{ii}]\\,\\lambda6731}$ ] ,",
    "maximal ( @xmath34 ) and minimal ( @xmath35 ) densities , associated to @xmath33 , can be obtained via fivel .",
    "an asymmetrical error bar usually results where the upper ( lower ) uncertainty is provided by the difference between @xmath34 ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath33 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "only @xmath33 values where both @xmath35 and @xmath34 are finite were retained ( see @xmath12  4.2.2 ) . according to fivel",
    ", this implies that @xmath35 and @xmath34 must be greater than 10 @xmath36 and lower than 15000 @xmath36 respectively ( these two values mostly depend on our choice of a constant electron temperature of 7400 k in ic1805 ) .",
    "our method considers that the statistical error on @xmath33 is entirely dominated by the data quality ( i.e. , s / n of the @xmath3sii@xmath4 $ ] lines ) and that the uncertainties on the atomic parameters , used by fivel , are negligible .",
    "however , using @xmath34 and @xmath35 to calculate the statistical error on @xmath33 probably overestimates the actual uncertainty on the electron density measurement .",
    "the distribution of the retained electron densities is provided by the black curve in figure 10__a _ _ ( the blue and red distributions will be discussed in @xmath12  5.2.1 ) .",
    "the histogram has a mean of 155@xmath37 @xmath36 where the error bars correspond to the mean upper ( @xmath38 ) and lower ( @xmath39 ) uncertainty retrieved from the 3057 electron - density points preserved .",

    "all 3057 points mentioned in @xmath12  4.2.3 formed the regular - line distribution . as shown by the thick - line histogram , the presence of large values i.e. , above @xmath103.5@xmath403.6 ,",
    "is reduced by considering only data points of very high quality ( i.e. , requiring here , arbitrarily , that s / n@xmath920 in the first condition of @xmath12  4.2.2 ) .",

    "extreme values for @xmath6\\,\\lambda6584}{[\\textnormal{n}\\,\\textsc{ii}]\\,\\lambda6548}$ ] i.e. , below 2 or well - above 4 , were not measured .",
    "hence , condition 5 , listed in @xmath12  4.2.2 , was not used in this work to reject particular emission - line profiles although it could used by other authors for future , similar studies .    considering the relatively high s",

    "panels ( a ) of figures 12 to 14 provide a series of line - ratio diagnostic diagrams commonly used in optical observations .",

    "a clear , monotonic increase of the @xmath6\\,\\lambda6584}{[\\textnormal{n}\\,\\textsc{ii}]\\,\\lambda6548}$ ] line ratio with increasing densities would be expected as the @xmath3nii@xmath4$]@xmath16548 @xmath2 line becomes more - and - more affected by collisional de - excitations ( i.e. , decreases in intensity ) .",
    "as expected , the linear relation shows a positive slope although its value , very close to 0 , largely suggests no correlation at all .",
    "indeed , the quality of the linear fit is relatively poor with a correlation coefficient of 0.35 .",
    "hence , we believe that no conclusion can be drawn from figure 15 .",
    "two possibilities are however provided in order to explain such behavior .",
    "first , the reader should note that the uncertainties are relatively large for both parameters investigated .",
    "the mean uncertainty for the @xmath6\\,\\lambda6584}{[\\textnormal{n}\\,\\textsc{ii}]\\,\\lambda6548}$ ] line ratio is 0.17 while typical uncertainties for the electron - density measurements @xmath33 are provided in the last paragraph of @xmath12  4.2.3 .",
    "the poor correlation of the linear fit in figure 15 could be attributed to large error bars .",
    "moreover , the absence of a well - defined correlation between @xmath33 and @xmath6\\,\\lambda6584}{[\\textnormal{n}\\,\\textsc{ii}]\\,\\lambda6548}$ ] would not be surprising if the n@xmath11 and s@xmath11 material are not perfectly cospatial in the vicinity of melotte 15 . given a difference of more than 4 ev between the ionization potentials of neutral nitrogen and sulfur , it can be assumed that the electron densities , computed from the @xmath3sii@xmath4 $ ] doublet , may not reflect accurately the physical conditions prevailing in the n@xmath11 ionic volume .",
    "therefore , the @xmath33 vs. @xmath6\\,\\lambda6584}{[\\textnormal{n}\\,\\textsc{ii}]\\,\\lambda6548}$ ] diagram of figure 15 could be an interesting diagnostic tool although our data set may not provide the appropriate spectral information to reliably construct such a diagram .",
    "alternatively , given the first ionization potential of nitrogen ( 14.5 ev ) and oxygen ( 13.6 ev ) , the @xmath41\\,\\lambda3726}{[\\textnormal{o}\\,\\textsc{ii}]\\,\\lambda3729}$ ] line ratio would likely give a more accurate indication of the density behavior inside the n@xmath11 volume .",
    "panels ( a ) of figures 12 to 14 reveal that a large fraction of the nebular - gas content in the vicinity of the melotte 15 star cluster appears to be dominated by photoionization , typical of standard hii regions .",
    "however , points identified outside the expected regime for hii regions and located near the `` snrs '' area demand to be closely investigated ( see @xmath12  4.2.5 ) . in all three figures , these are symbolized as red filled circles and potentially indicate the presence of shocks in the targeted nebular volume .",
    "these areas of our fov , suggesting shock excitation , are identified as red dots in all three panels ( b ) of the same figures .",
    "however , at this point , shock excitation in ic1805 remains highly hypothetical .",
    "this is somewhat surprising considering the presence of relatively massive stars in melotte 15 and their associated strong stellar winds ( see @xmath12  2 ) . in order to deeply investigate the impact of shock excitation in ic1805 , we assume that , if present , the shock - excited ionized material is relatively confined and localized along the line - of - sight i.e. , considering the imposing dimensions of the large hii region ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the interface between compressive shocks and the surrounding ism could be several times smaller than the size of the nebula itself .",
    "this said , the expected spectral signature of shock excitation could be strongly diluted by photoionized foreground / background material .",
    "a total of 2378 out of 3057 emission - line profiles retained for this study are directly associated to the bright , central structure clearly visible in figure 8 .",
    "the strong emission of its ionized component ( see peak intensities in figures 3 to 7 ) and therefore the quality of the gathered signal make this structure , surrounded by the most massive stars of the melotte 15 cluster , the ideal feature in our quest for shock excitation in central ic1805 .",
    "first , a series of four weaker portions [ in gas emission ] , specifically surrounding the central structure , were selected .",
    "each of these portions was spatially binned into a single 1@xmath231@xmath23249 ( spatial@xmath23spatial@xmath23channels ) emission - line profile . for each of the 2378 spectra selected and investigated in this subsection ,",
    "the corresponding foreground / background emission was approximately recovered using a linear combination of these four 1@xmath231@xmath23249 profiles .",
    "each of the four linear coefficients was weighted via the inverse of the distance separating the targeted pixel from the center of the corresponding weaker portion ( e.g. , the larger this distance is , the smaller is the corresponding linear coefficient and , therefore , the smaller is the statistical impact of this weaker zone on the computation of the foreground / background spectral signature at the position of this given pixel ) .",
    "hence , a unique foreground / background spectrum is constructed for each of the 2378 points ( see below ) although neighbor pixels have [ as it should be ] foreground / background material with very similar spectral signatures ( i.e. , roughly identical linear coefficients ) .",
    "the subtraction of the foreground / background emission obviously had a certain incidence on the s / n of the resulting profiles , the peak intensity of all five lines being reduced in the subtracting process . still following all conditions listed in @xmath12  4.2.2 , 2229 emission - line profiles out of 2378",

    "shock - dominated material seems to prevail along the southern portion of the central structure , directly exposed to the stellar winds and currently eroded by the ionizing flux of the two most massive stars identified in melotte 15 ( identified by black arrows in figure 17__d _ _ ) .",

    "however , keeping in mind that the subtraction of , what we referred to as , the foreground / background material was required in order to spectrally detect evidences for shock excitation in ic1805 , it seems logical that the same procedure should be applied in the extraction of the electron densities specifically associated to the shocked , ionized component . using the 1419 post - subtraction emission - line profiles that showed evidences for shock excitation , the corresponding electron densities ( @xmath28@xmath45 ) were computed following the method described in @xmath12  4.2.3 .",

    "its mean is estimated slightly above 10 i.e. , those points ( red in figure 17__d _ _ ) where , we believe , shocks may certainly dominate seem to be characterized by greater compression effects with respect to points ( green in figure 17__d _ _ ) where the presence of shocks appears less obvious .    for abiadatic jump conditions ,",

    "the relatively large widths of the distributions displayed in figure 18 indicate that isothermal shocks may dominate . also , the fact that forbidden lines such as @xmath3nii@xmath4 $ ] and @xmath3sii@xmath4 $ ] are detected favors radiative cooling and therefore non - adiabatic effects [ although these lines most likely originate from ionized material trapped in the cooling , shocked outer shell and therefore may not be related to the wind - blown bubble s current state of expansion i.e. , energy- or momentum - driven ] .",
    "theoretically , for an isothermal shock ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) , the compression factor corresponds to the square of the shock s mach number , @xmath47 ( see the abscissa in figure 18 ) .",

    "note , however , that the compression measured here could be an upper limit since photoeroded gas located in the molecular cloud s envelope , rather than the diffuse foreground / background component , may act as pre - shocked material .",
    "the cloud s envelope is expected to be , at least , a few tens of particles per @xmath49 denser than typical values found for @xmath46 in this work @xcite .    assuming a coplanar geometry , roughly 3@xmath404 pc separate the most massive star of the melotte 15 cluster and the central , ionized structure .",
    "using the standard model for expanding wind - blown bubbles @xcite , the distance reached by a given bubble s post - shocked shell can be estimated from the mechanical luminosity of the winds ( @xmath50=@xmath51@xmath52@xmath53 ) , the density of the pre - shocked medium ( @xmath46 ) and the total time during which winds have been blown by the central star ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "given @xmath54=2.5 myr , the age of the melotte 15 cluster ( see @xmath12  2 ) , we expect that two massive giant and supergiant o4 stars have left just very recently the main - sequence branch .",

    "again , north is up and east is left .",
    "the star is particularly visible on the left - hand side of figure 8 and has been cataloged by @xcite as hbh@xmath06211 - 05 with a v - band magnitude of 14.6 and no known spectral type .",
    "its coordinates are ( @xmath17=02@xmath1834@xmath1910@xmath20.06 , @xmath16=61@xmath1324@xmath1435@xmath21.7 ) . the elongated feature was briefly introduced in @xmath12  4.1 .",
    "emission in h@xmath0 and @xmath3nii@xmath4 $ ] is detected on the outskirts of the cigar - like feature while its center appears mostly gas depleted .",
    "this overall scheme is particularly similar to what is expected from elephant trunks in hii regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "shadowing effects , caused by a dense neutral globule located in a radiation field , allow the warm gas behind it to recombine which could explain the absence of ionized material at the center of the elongated structure .",
    "the bright ionized rims are formed of photoevaporated material created by the erosion of the neutral globule .",
    "these flows move away from the ionizing star creating the cigar - like shape .    both the fcrao co(1 - 0 ) survey and the canadian galactic plane survey at 21 cm @xcite reveal no indication for either molecular or atomic gas associated to the elongated feature .",
    "theoretically , h@xmath58 gas is expected to constitute the main component of the eroded globule while hi material should result from recombinations in the tail .",
    "the whole structure , however , has relatively small angular dimensions ( 45@xmath21@xmath237@xmath21 ) which suggests that emission from the neutral gas could be beam diluted in the low - resolution radio observations .",
    "theory has suggested that shocks will develop in elephant trunks @xcite although , in first approximation , the log@xmath42)}\\right]$ ] vs. log@xmath43)}\\right]$ ] diagram has shown nothing particular using the first set of gaussian fits i.e. , all points associated to the elongated structure are well - confined into the `` hii regions '' area . however , subtracting the foreground / background material yields the diagram displayed in panel ( d ) of figure 19 .",
    "none of the conditions listed in @xmath12  4.2.2 were considered .",
    "only a s / n greater than 3 ( sufficiently high to confirm a physical detection ; see @xmath12  4.2.2 ) was here required .",
    "therefore , the results are highly questionable although worth mentioning . the ionized material at the center of the cigar - like feature being very tenuous ( or simply non - existent ;",
    "see above ) , all points filling the diagram are found along the external bright rims .",
    "panel ( d ) reveals that the `` snrs '' area of shock - dominated material is highly favored , in agreement with the prediction of shock development proposed by the theory .",
    "the particular shape of the elongated structure presented in panel ( c ) could be easily mistaken for jets attributed to herbig - haro ( hh ) objects .",
    "however , figure 4__a _ _ of @xcite indicates the peculiar low intensities of the @xmath3nii@xmath4 $ ] lines in hh objects .",
    "this leads to a position , for hh objects in the log@xmath42)}\\right]$ ] vs. log@xmath43)}\\right]$ ] diagram , clearly above the `` snrs '' area .",
    "this said , the diagram of panel ( d ) most likely confirms that the cigar - like feature is not part of an hh object in ic1805 .",
    "rather , the elephant - trunk nature , suggested here , appears very plausible .",
    "the use of the imaging fourier transform spectrometer spiomm allowed us to obtain series of emission - line profiles of the optical gas in the brightest , central portions of the galactic ic1805 hii region .",
    "the bandwidth used at data acquisition allowed the simultaneous observations of the h@xmath0@xmath16563 @xmath2 , @xmath3nii@xmath4$]@xmath1@xmath16548 , 6584 @xmath2 , and @xmath3sii@xmath4$]@xmath1@xmath16716 , 6731 @xmath2 ionic lines ( see @xmath12  3 ) .",
    "the main goal of this work was to investigate on the presence of supersonic shock waves attributed to stellar winds in the vicinity of melotte 15 , the current star cluster actually fueling up the expansion of the ic1805 nebula .",
    "literature has long suggested that a kinematical detection of stellar winds , in hii region , might represent a difficult task since the typical expansion velocity of shocked shells could be commonly confused with other dynamical processes revealing similar kinematical behaviors ( see @xmath12  1 ) . on the other hand , specific line ratios retrieved from the optical gas",
    "may indicate if the presence of ionized material is attributed to standard photoionization or to shock excitation .",
    "these line ratios therefore provide a non - kinematical tool for identifying shocks in the nebular volume .",
    "our results are summarized as follow :    1 .",
    "the @xmath6\\,\\lambda6584}{[\\textnormal{n}\\,\\textsc{ii}]\\,\\lambda6548}$ ] line ratio genuinely deviates from the theoretical value of 3 ( see @xmath12  5.1 ) .",
    "values varying between 2.5 and 4 were commonly found .",
    "the distribution of the density measurements has not allowed to demonstrate that the @xmath3nii@xmath4$]@xmath16548 @xmath2 line could be affected by collisional de - excitations , hence reducing its peak intensity .",
    "this scenario remains nonetheless plausible and could be verified if densities , in the n@xmath11 volume , could be measured precisely ( see @xmath12  5.1 ) .",
    "densities extracted from the @xmath5\\,\\lambda6716}{[\\textnormal{s}\\,\\textsc{ii}]\\,\\lambda6731}$ ] ratio may not perfectly reflect the conditions prevailing in the n@xmath11 volume if both nitrogen and sulfur are not co - spatial in central ic1805 .",
    "2 .   the diagnostic diagrams , introduced by @xcite , indicate , in first approximation , that photoionization most likely dominate in ic1805 ( see @xmath12  4.2.5 ) .",
    "this initially holds even for the densest , most emissive structures in our field - of - view , directly exposed to the radiation fields and stellar winds of the nearby , most massive stars ( see @xmath12  5.2 ) .",
    "evidences for shock excitation appear only following the subtraction of the diffuse foreground / background material .",
    "this component likely occupies a very large fraction of the nebular volume in ic1805 ; a volume sufficiently large that , even though being tenuous in nature , the foreground / background material strongly dilutes the signal emanating from shocked condensations along the line - of - sight .",
    "its mean density is estimated at 25 @xmath36 ( see @xmath12  5.2.1 ) .",
    "4 .   oriented on a south - north axis and surrounded by numerous o - stars , a bright , large ionized feature occupies the central area of our field - of - view .",
    "the last , tenuous fragments of an old molecular cloud can be found near its southern portion .",
    "shocks may have contributed to ionize material found in the direct vicinity of the molecular clump while the northern parts of the ionized feature , deprived of molecular emission , appears to be largely dominated by photoionization ( see @xmath12  5.2.1 ) .",
    "the shock - excited ionized gas has a mean density of 175 @xmath36 and the compression factor , between pre- and post - shocked gas , is typically between 2 and 10 . for isothermal shocks",
    ", this suggests shock velocities between 15 and 30 km s@xmath8 , in agreement with models describing the expansion of wind - blown bubbles ( see @xmath12  5.2.1 )",
    ". geometrically speaking , given the apparent proximity between the central , ionized structure and the most massive stars of melotte 15 , winds seem to have had sufficient time to reach the structure within a timescale corresponding to the age of the star cluster ( see @xmath12  5.2.1 ) .",
    "this gives credence to our assumption that shock excitation can be found in the south - central portions of our field - of - view .",
    "points identified with a high probability of shock excitation reveal compression factors typically greater than those points where shocks may be present although less certain ( see @xmath12  5.2.1 ) . 7 .",
    "shocks did not seem to have played a major role in the ionization of a molecular cloud s envelope located in the south - eastern portion of our field - of - view .",
    "this most likely results from the molecular fragment being located too far from the ionizing sources so that ( 1 ) shocks induced by stellar winds have not reached yet the cloud or ( 2 ) shocks have reached the cloud with velocities too low to initiate shock excitation ( see @xmath12  5.2.2.1 ) .",
    "shock development was clearly detected on the outskirts of an apparently weak , but well - defined elephant trunk located in the eastern portion of our field - of - view ( see @xmath12  5.2.2.2 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with theoretical works developed on such feature typically found in hii regions .",
