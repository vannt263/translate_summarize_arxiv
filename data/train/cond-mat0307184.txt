    "recently there have been considerable efforts to understand complex systems in terms of random graph , consisting of vertices and edges , where vertices ( edges ) represent individuals ( acquaintances or their interactions ) @xcite . in such complex networks ,",
    "the emergence of a power - law degree distribution , @xmath8 , is an interesting feature .",
    "such networks are called scale - free ( sf ) networks . to illustrate such sf behavior ,",
    "many _ in silico _ models have been introduced , whose examples include the barabsi and albert model  @xcite , the huberman and adamic model  @xcite , etc . in those models",
    ", the number of vertices grows with time .",
    "the static model  @xcite is another type of _ in silico _ model designed to generate sf networks , where the number of vertices is fixed .",
    "each vertex is indexed by an integer @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and assigned its own weight @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a tunable parameter .",
    "next , two different vertices @xmath13 are selected with probabilities equal to normalized weights , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , and are connected via an edge unless one exists already .",
    "this process is repeated until @xmath16 edges are present in the system , so that the mean degree is @xmath17 .",
    "then it follows that the degree distribution is sf with the exponent @xmath18 .",
    "thus , tuning the parameter @xmath12 in @xmath19 , we can obtain a continuous spectrum of the exponent @xmath20 in the range @xmath21 , for which the degree distribution has finite mean and diverging variance .",
    "since the number of vertices does not grow , one may wonder if this model can be applied to evolving real world network .",
    "however , since the model network can be easily generated and exhibits little hump in the degree distribution , it can be useful to study many aspects of sf networks .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the static model by allowing a @xmath0-component weight @xmath22 to each vertex @xmath9 .",
    "we suppose that the @xmath2-th component @xmath23 of a vertex @xmath9 represents its own weight or fitness to a subgroup @xmath1 ( @xmath24 ) in a society .",
    "for example , we suppose that two persons @xmath9 and @xmath25 are alumni of a high school , a subgroup @xmath1 .",
    "they would have different weights @xmath23 and @xmath26 in the subgroup @xmath1 , determined by their school activities .",
    "the person @xmath9 and another person @xmath27 are colleagues in a company , another subgroup @xmath28 .",
    "they have also different weights , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , by their positions in the company , the subgroup @xmath28 .",
    "then the person @xmath9 has weights @xmath23 and @xmath29 in different subgroups , which are not the same in general .",
    "we make an edge between the pair ( @xmath9,@xmath25 ) in one color representing the subgroup @xmath1 and the pair ( @xmath9,@xmath27 ) in another color for the subgroup @xmath28 .",
    "vertices in the system are connected with edges in @xmath0 different colors representing different subgroups .",
    "subgroups are then connected each other by weak ties as explained later . since",
    "our society comprises many different subgroups and a person can be acquainted with other people belonging to diverse subgroups , this generalized static model is useful for modeling social networks .",
    "meanwhile , it is noteworthy that our model is reminiscent of the generalization of the ising model to the @xmath0-component cubic model  @xcite in equilibrium spin systems .",
    "-component static model with parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "edges in four colors ( red , yellow , green and blue ) are the connections within each group . edges in orange are those formed by maximum weights .",
    "edges in more than two colors are colored in black . ]",
    "so far , there have been many attempts to explain the structures and the properties of social networks @xcite .",
    "recently , watts _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced a hierarchical model for social network . in the model , individuals belong to groups that in turn belong to groups of groups and so on , creating a tree - like hierarchical structure of social organization . here",
    "an individual can belong to more than one group , as a result of which the distance between two persons is shorter than the ultrametric distance between them .",
    "such hierarchical model illustrates well the small - world property of social network as implied in the milgram s  six degrees of separation \" @xcite .",
    "another simple social network model , introduced by newman and park  @xcite , is based on the concept of bipartite graph  @xcite and community structure @xcite .",
    "this has an advantage toward explaining the non - trivial high clustering of real - world social networks . while our @xmath0-component model is similar to the hierarchical model and the community model in the spirit of dividing people into subgroups , however , we assign weights to each person for each subgroup , and connections are made following those weights .",
    "social network exhibits an interesting feature in the degree - degree correlation function , different from biological or information networks .",
    "newman  @xcite studied the degree - degree correlation in terms of the correlation function between the remaining degrees of the two vertices on each side of an edge , where the remaining degree means the degree of that vertex minus one .",
    "he introduced the assortativity coefficient @xmath6 , defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the joint probability that the two vertices on each side of a randomly chosen link have @xmath25 and @xmath27 remaining degrees , respectively .",
    "@xmath37 is the normalized distribution of the remaining degree @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "interestingly , complex networks can be classified into three types , having @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , called the dissortative , the neutral , and the assortative network , respectively @xcite .",
    "most social networks are assortative as shown in table i , while the internet and the protein interaction network are dissortative .",
    "while many _ in silico _ models have been introduced , most of them are neutral .",
    "thus it would be interesting to introduce an _ in silico _",
    "model having the assortativity coefficient as positive and large as empirical values , which would enable one to understand a basic mechanism of social network formation .",
    "we will show that such assortative networks can be generated via the @xmath0-component static model .",
    ".the size @xmath43 , the mean degree @xmath44 , the diameter @xmath45 , and the assortativity coefficient @xmath6 for a number of social networks . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the @xmath0-component static model network is constructed as follows .",
    "initially , @xmath43 vertices are present in the system , representing @xmath43 people in a society .",
    "each vertex is assigned a @xmath0-component weight @xmath46 , where @xmath9 is the vertex index .",
    "@xmath47 , the @xmath2-th weight of a vertex @xmath9 , is given as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the rank of the vertex @xmath9 in the @xmath2-th subgroup .",
    "we take @xmath50 be a random permutation of the integers @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is also taken to be a real random number distributed uniformly in the range @xmath19 .",
    "in general , ranks of a person for different subgroups should be correlated in real society ; however , we take them as independent in this work for simplicity . as",
    "the number of people @xmath43 becomes large , the number of distinct subgroups @xmath0 can increase in real world .",
    "thus , we set @xmath0 to be @xmath53 with @xmath54",
    ". then @xmath55 is the average number of people belonging to one subgroup .",
    "edges are connected as follows : first , among the @xmath0 components , we choose a component @xmath2 at random .",
    "second , we choose two vertices @xmath13 with probabilities equal to normalized weights , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and attach an edge between them with the @xmath2-th color unless an edge in that color exists already .",
    "edge color is distinct for each component .",
    "note that the pair @xmath13 can be connected via more than one edge in different colors .",
    "edges in different component are distinguished by their own colors .",
    "the process of attaching such edges is repeated until @xmath58 edges are added to the system .",
    "@xmath4 is a parameter between 0 and 1 .",
    "we will see that @xmath59 is related to the average degree . since the component was chosen randomly , the number of edges in one color is @xmath60 on average .     vs the degree @xmath27 obtained with @xmath61 and @xmath32 for @xmath62 , 100 and 1000 . ]     vs the parameter @xmath4 for various @xmath59 and @xmath0 .",
    "inset : @xmath4 dependence of the diameter . ]    to construct a minimal model mimicking social relations , we need elements playing the role of  weak ties \" @xcite .",
    "so , to take into account of social relationships among people having different backgrounds , we suppose that additional social relationships are formed following the maximum weights among the @xmath0 components each individual has .",
    "let @xmath63 be the normalized maximum weight of vertex @xmath9 . then",
    "two distinct vertices @xmath9 and @xmath25 are chosen with probabilities , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , and are linked by a new color different from the previous @xmath0 colors unless such an edge exists already .",
    "this process is repeated until @xmath66 edges are formed .",
    "edges formed by such maximum weights can be regarded as weak ties , introduced by granovetter @xcite which play an important role in social networks , connecting different subgroups .",
    "we find that the assortativity coefficient is enhanced by the presence of such weak ties .",
    "networks constructed in this way have @xmath16 edges with @xmath5 colors representing internal structure of subgroups .",
    "so , some pair of vertices are linked by more than one edges in different colors , albeit such incidences are not so frequent when @xmath0 is large .",
    "however , when we measure the network properties such as the shortest pathways , the degree of a vertex , the assortativity coefficient , and so on , we regard those multiple edges as a single one . thus the mean degree @xmath44 is slightly less than @xmath17 by about 5% for typical networks we consider below . a small size network constructed in this way",
    "is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we perform numerical simulations for various values of @xmath0 , @xmath4 , @xmath59 and @xmath43 , and examine the diameter @xmath45 and the assortativity coefficient @xmath6 as functions of those parameters . here",
    "the diameter is the average distance between a connected pair of vertices along the shortest pathways .",
    "first , the shape of the degree distribution depends on the number of subgroups . for small @xmath0",
    ", the degree distribution follows a power law with @xmath67 , however , for large @xmath0 , it has a highly skewed form , approximately obeying a power law for a part of its range , and having an apparently exponential cutoff for larger @xmath27 . the exponential cutoff for large @xmath27 originates from the randomness of ranks of each subgroup , and the sf behavior for intermediate @xmath27 does from the sf behavior of each subgroup .",
    "a similar crossover behavior can be found in real social networks , for example , the collaboration networks of physicists , biologists and movie stars @xcite .",
    "second , we examine the assortative coefficient @xmath6 as a function of @xmath4 for a fixed @xmath43 and several values of @xmath59 and @xmath0 . as shown in fig .  3 , the assortativity coefficient exhibits a peak around @xmath68 , meaning that the connections among subgroups are mostly optimized .",
    "thus we limit our further consideration to the case @xmath34",
    ". meanwhile , the diameter gradually decreases with increasing @xmath4 as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "third , we study the assortativity coefficient @xmath6 as a function of @xmath43 for various @xmath59 and @xmath0 .",
    "it is likely that @xmath6 increases with increasing @xmath43 as @xmath69 as shown in fig .  4 ,",
    "but it seems to saturate for larger @xmath43 .",
    "it also increases with increasing @xmath59 and @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "thus the @xmath0-component static model exhibits @xmath6 values as large as empirical values listed in table i. some numerical results of @xmath6 listed in table ii show a quantitative agreement with the ones obtained in real social networks .",
    "fourth , the diameter @xmath45 is investigated as a function of the number of vertices @xmath43 for various @xmath59 and @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "it is found that the diameter is proportional to @xmath70 as in the case of random graph , in which @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the diameter becomes smaller as @xmath59 increases , which is like the case of random graphs .",
    "however , the diameter is almost insensitive to @xmath0 . to test the so - called  six degrees of separation \" , we extrapolate the straight line in the semi - logarithmic plot of fig .  5 to large @xmath43 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we obtain @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 , in reasonable agreement with the milgram s  six degrees of separation \"  @xcite . here",
    "the choice of @xmath72 and @xmath73 comes from the facts that a person knows about 20 other people on average ( see chapter 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and there are about 100 members on average in a subgroup  @xcite .",
    "vs @xmath78 for various @xmath59 and @xmath0 values . ]     vs the size @xmath43 for the same parameters used in fig .",
    "fifth , one of the properties well studied for complex networks is the clustering coefficient @xmath79 , which is defined as the average over all vertices of the ratio of the number of triangles connected to a given vertex to the number of triples centered on that vertex .",
    "it is known that for the neutral network , the clustering coefficient behaves as @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "thus when @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "for the @xmath0-component static model , while @xmath6 is not close to zero , the rule of attaching edges is such that no explicit degree - degree correlation enters , so that it is natural to expect the behavior @xmath82 .",
    "indeed , the measured behavior is close to the expected one as shown in fig .  6 , but the slope in fig",
    ".  6 exhibits small deviations for smaller @xmath0 . for neutral networks",
    ", it is known that the clustering coefficient of a vertex with @xmath27 is almost independent of degree @xmath27 . even in our case , we find that indeed @xmath83 is independent of @xmath27 for different @xmath43 as shown in the inset of fig .  6 .",
    "vs the size @xmath43 for various @xmath59 , @xmath0 and @xmath4 values .",
    "the slopes of the fit lines are @xmath84 for solid and -0.9 for the dashed lines , drawn for the eye .",
    "inset : plot of @xmath83 vs degree @xmath27 for various @xmath43 with fixed @xmath32 , @xmath85 and @xmath34 . ]",
    "we have introduced the @xmath0-component static model assigning a @xmath0-component weight to each vertex .",
    "the weight of a given component of a vertex mimics a weight or fitness of that person in that subgroup . through this model",
    ", we obtained the diameter of the acquaintance network as small as the milgram s  six degrees of separation \" and the assortativity coefficient as positive and large as empirical values for a variety of social networks .",
    "moreover , we obtain the degree distribution in a skewed form , which is also similar to those of real world social networks . the clustering coefficients @xmath86 and @xmath83 behave as those of a neutral network , being due to the absence of intrinsic degree - degree correlation .",
    "such deficiency of the present model may be improved by introducing the hierarchical structure among subgroups , or correlated ranks of a person for different subgroups .",

    "goh for sharing his code for the static model and valuable discussions .",
