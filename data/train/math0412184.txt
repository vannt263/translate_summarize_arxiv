    "there are two important classes of knots in a contact 3-sphere @xmath2 : legendrian knots and transverse knots .",
    "legendrian knots are everywhere tangent to the contact planes ; transverse knots are everywhere transverse to them .",
    "there are simple `` classical '' invariants for both classes : the thurston  bennequin and the rotation number for legendrian knots , and the self - linking number for transverse knots .",
    "while certain knot types , e.g. all torus knots @xcite , are completely classified by these invariants ( in this case the knot type is said to be _ legendrian resp .",
    "transversely simple _ ) , for most knot types the classification is not known . there",
    "exist smoothly isotopic legendrian resp .",
    "transverse knots with the same classical invariants which are not isotopic through legendrian resp . transverse knots .",
    "legendrian knots are somewhat better understood and enjoy a rich theory in the context of symplectic field theory @xcite : a certain differential graded algebra associated to a knot yields new legendrian knot invariants .",
    "transverse non - simplicity of certain knot types was demonstrated by birman and menasco in @xcite and by etnyre and honda in @xcite . however , the existing examples are sparse ( those of @xcite are not even explicit ) , and the proofs in @xcite and @xcite require a subtle analysis of braids and contact manifolds .",
    "unlike legendrian knots , transverse knots do not have any known efficient non - classical invariants .      in this paper",
    "we introduce a transverse link invariant @xmath3 as a distinguished element of the khovanov homology of @xmath4 . given a closed braid diagram representing the transverse link , @xmath3 is defined via a certain resolution of @xmath4 .",
    "this invariant encodes the self - linking number : the quantum degree of @xmath3 is given by @xmath5 .",
    "it also discerns transverse stabilizations : if @xmath4 arises as a transverse stabilization of another transverse link , @xmath3 vanishes . on the other hand , @xmath6 for quasipositive braids . while we do nt have any examples of transverse knots distinguished by @xmath3 but not @xmath5 ( indeed",
    ", we show that the invariant is the same for the pairs of transversely non - isotopic knots from @xcite ) , we hope that a connection to khovanov homology might be helpful .",
    "in particular , we establish a bound on the self - linking number of a knot in terms of the khovanov homology knot invariant of rasmussen @xcite .",
    "khovanov homology is an invariant of knots and links introduced in @xcite . given a link @xmath4 in @xmath7 , @xmath8 is a graded homology module whose graded euler characteristic is the unnormalized jones polynomial of @xmath4 .",
    "as was recently discovered , the khovanov homology has an interesting relation to low - dimensional topology .",
    "ozsvth and szab @xcite construct a spectral sequence converging to the heegaard floer homology @xmath9 of the double cover @xmath10 of @xmath7 branched over a link @xmath4 ; the @xmath11 term of this spectral sequence is the ( reduced ) khovanov homology of the link @xmath4 .",
    "rasmussen @xcite uses khovanov homology to give a combinatorial proof of the milnor conjecture ( i.e. , to determine the slice genus of a torus knot ) .",
    "our transverse link invariant suggests a further connection to contact topology .",
    "in fact , we can define a similar invariant in the reduced khovanov theory ; we conjecture that this invariant is mapped to the ozsvth - szab contact invariant of the double cover of @xmath12 branched over the transverse link under the spectral sequence of @xcite .",
    "i would like to thank jake rasmussen for extremely helpful email correspondence , and peter kronheimer and ciprian manolescu for illuminating conversations and encouragement .",
    "it will be convenient to work with closed braid representations of transverse knots .",
    "consider @xmath7 equipped with the ( rotationally symmetric ) standard contact structure @xmath13 .",
    "it easy to see that any closed braid around @xmath14-axis can be made transverse to the contact planes .",
    "moreover , by a theorem of bennequin @xcite any transverse link in @xmath2 is transversely isotopic to a closed braid .",
    "we adopt the usual notation for braid words .",
    "the braid group on @xmath15 strings is generated by @xmath16 , so that @xmath17 permutes the @xmath18-th and the @xmath19-th strings .",
    "we will sometimes write a braid as a braid word , a certain product of the generators @xmath16 and their inverses . the positive resp . negative stabilization of a braid on @xmath15 strings is formed by adding the @xmath20-th string and multiplying the braid word by @xmath21 resp .",
    "@xmath22 .",
    "of course , the same link can be represented by different braids .",
    "the markov theorem @xcite asserts that two braid words describing the same link are related by a sequence of stabilizations , destabilizations and conjugations in the braid group ( and , of course , the braid group identities ) .",
    "the transverse markov theorem describes the relation between two braid representations of the same transverse links .",
    "@xcite [ markov ] let @xmath23 , @xmath24 be two closed braids which represent transversely isotopic links",
    ". then @xmath24 can be obtained from @xmath23 by a sequence of positive braid stabilizations and braid isotopies .",

    "in this section we give a brief review of khovanov homology ( more or less following the review in @xcite ) .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we work with coefficients in @xmath33 .      given a link diagram @xmath4 , we can resolve its crossings so that the result is just the union of planar circles .",
    "each crossing can be resolved in two ways , called the 0-resolution and the 1-resolution and shown in fig.[0 - 1-pos - neg ] .",
