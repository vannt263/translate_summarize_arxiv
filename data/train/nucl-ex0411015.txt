    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the theory of strong interaction in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom . while qcd has been extremely well tested in the high energy regime , where perturbative qcd is applicable , understanding confinement and hadron structure in the non - perturbative region of qcd remains challenging .",
    "knowledge of the internal structure of protons and neutrons in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom is not only essential for testing qcd in the confinement regime , but it also provides a basis for understanding more complex , strongly interacting matter at the level of quarks and gluons .",
    "the proton electric ( @xmath0 ) and magnetic ( @xmath1 ) form factors have been studied extensively in the past from unpolarized electron - proton ( @xmath2 ) elastic scattering using the rosenbluth separation technique @xcite .",
    "new data from polarization transfer experiments @xcite , which measure this ratio directly with unprecedented precision , show very intriguing behavior at higher @xmath3 . the form factor ratio , @xmath4 drops to approximately 0.5 at a @xmath3 value above 3 ( gev / c)@xmath5 , and to approximately 0.3 at the highest measured @xmath3 value ( @xmath6 5.5 ( gev / c)@xmath5 ) .",

    "these new data  @xcite suggest that the proton dirac ( @xmath7 ) and pauli form factor ( @xmath8 ) scale as @xmath9 at large values of @xmath3 .",
    "contributions from nonzero parton orbital angular momentum are power suppressed as shown by lepage and brodsky  @xcite .",
    "however , they are shown to lead to asymptotic scaling of the proton form factor ratio : @xmath10 with 0.2 gev@xmath110.4 gev based on an explicit pqcd calculation  @xcite or @xmath12  @xcite that agrees with the jlab proton form factor data  @xcite .",
    "a recent nonperturbative analysis  @xcite of the hadronic form factors based on light - front wave functions also describes the jlab proton form factor data  @xcite well .",
    "while the intriguing @xmath3 dependence of the proton form factor ratio can be described  @xcite , it is important to understand the discrepancy between results obtained from recoil proton polarization measurements and those from rosenbluth method .",
    "new jefferson lab data  @xcite ( solid circles in fig .",
    "1 ) from rosenbluth separation are in good agreement with previous slac results .",
    "recently , a new , `` superrosenbluth '' experiment was carried out at jefferson lab  @xcite , in which the struck protons were detected to minimize systematic uncertainties associated with regular rosenbluth technique in which scattered electron is detected .",
    "preliminary results  @xcite from the `` superrosenbluth '' experiment agree with previous rosenbluth experiments .",
    "two - photon exchange contributions  @xcite are believed to contribute to the observed discrepancy between the polarization method and the rosenbluth technique . currently , there are intensive efforts both in theory  @xcite and in experiment  @xcite aiming at understanding the two - photon exchange contributions to electron scattering in general , particularly to the aforementioned discrepancy in the proton form factor ratio",
    ". a new experiment  @xcite in which longitudinally polarized electrons scattering off a polarized proton target is currently ongoing at mit - bates and the proton electric to magnetic form factor ratio will be extracted with high precision up to a @xmath3 value of about 0.8 ( gev / c)@xmath5 .",
    "such a double - polarization experiment is important because it employs a completely different experimental technique with different systematic uncertainties than recoil proton polarization measurements .    .",

    "measurements of the neutron electric form factor are extremely challenging because of the lack of free neutron targets , the smallness of the @xmath13 , and the dominance of the magnetic contribution to the unpolarized differential cross - section .",
    "a promising approach to measure @xmath13 is by using polarization degrees of freedom . for coincidence elastic scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons from `` free '' neutrons , @xmath14 process ,",
    "the recoil neutron polarization ratio @xmath15 is sensitive to the neutron electric to magnetic form factor ratio  @xcite .",
    "experiments with longitudinally polarized electron beams and recoil neutron polarimeters have been carried out at mit - bates  @xcite and mainz  @xcite in the relatively low @xmath3 region , and @xmath16 has been extracted from the @xmath17 process , using the state - of - the - art two - body calculations by arenhvel  @xcite .",
    "most recently , such an approach has been employed at jefferson lab up to a @xmath3 value of 1.5 ( gev / c)@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can employ a vector polarized deuteron target or a polarized @xmath18he target to probe the neutron electric form factor by the @xmath19 reaction or the @xmath20 process .",
    "a polarized @xmath18he nucleus is an effective neutron target because its ground state is dominated by a spatially symmetric @xmath21 wave in which the proton spins cancel and the spin of the @xmath18he nucleus is carried by the unpaired neutron  @xcite .",
    "the spin - dependent asymmetries from the @xmath19 reaction for vector polarized deuteron and from @xmath20 process give access to the quantity @xmath22 to first order when the target spin direction is aligned perpendicular to the momentum transfer vector @xmath23 .",
    "the neutron electric form factor was extracted for the first time  @xcite from a @xmath24 measurement at nikhef in which a vector polarized deuteron target from an atomic beam source was employed .",
    "more recently , a @xmath24 experiment  @xcite using a dynamically polarized solid deuterated ammonia target was carried out at jefferson lab and @xmath13 was extracted at @xmath3 values of 0.5 and 1.0 ( gev / c)@xmath5 .",
    "following the first measurement on @xmath16 from @xmath25 at mainz @xcite , two more experiments  @xcite were carried out .",

    "this procedure requires the separation of the longitudinal and transverse cross sections and the subsequent subtraction of a large proton contribution .",
    "thus , it suffers from large theoretical uncertainties due in part to the deuteron model employed and in part to corrections for final - state interactions ( fsi ) and meson - exchange currents ( mec ) .",
    "these complications can largely be avoided if one measures the cross - section ratio of @xmath28 to @xmath29 at quasi - elastic kinematics .",
    "several recent experiments @xcite have employed this technique to extract @xmath27 with uncertainties of @xmath302%  @xcite at @xmath3 below 1 ( gev / c)@xmath5 . despite the high precision",
    "reported , however , there is considerable disagreement among some of the experiments  @xcite with respect to the absolute value of @xmath27 .",
    "the most recent deuterium data @xcite further emphasize this discrepancy . while the discrepancies among the deuterium experiments described above may be understood @xcite , additional data on @xmath27 , preferably obtained using a complementary method ,",
    "are highly desirable .",
    "inclusive quasi - elastic @xmath31 scattering provides just such an alternative approach @xcite . recently precision data on @xmath32 have been obtained from inclusive quasi - elastic @xmath31 process at jefferson lab @xcite .",
