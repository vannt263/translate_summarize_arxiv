    "quantum dots ( qds ) are quasi zero - dimensional semiconducting systems in which the de broglie wavelength of the electrons at the fermi level is comparable to the spatial extension of the confinement .",

    "are typically defined in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) residing in a semiconductor heterostructure and can be tuned electrostatically by nanopatterned gate electrodes .",
    "@xcite qd formation by magnetic confinement is a potential alternative showing some fascinating and quite different phenomena .",
    "@xcite for example , sim et al .",
    "have calculated the energy spectrum of a qd formed by circular symmetric magnetic steps oriented perpendicular to a 2deg and identified the corresponding , rosette shaped classical trajectories , revealing that the character of the bound states is completely different from those found in electrostatically defined qds .",
    "@xcite it has also been predicted that chaotic qds with tunable lyapunov exponents can be formed by suitable magnetic field patterns .",
    "@xcite however , it has remained unclear how these systems can be implemented and probed experimentally .",
    "one suggestion from the theory side is to embed the magnetic dot in a quantum wire and to extract the information on the dot s energy spectrum via conductance resonances .",
    "@xcite experimentally , magnetic dots have been formed by using the fringe field of a ferromagnet on top of a semiconductor heterostructure . @xcite",
    "magnetically bound , zero - dimensional states localized at the circumference of a magnetic coral have been observed on such samples .",
    "these states cause magnetoresistance oscillations which reflect the fact that scattering at the magnetic step is perfectly specular .",
    "@xcite this magnetic confinement concept , however , leads to open dots which are strongly coupled to the environment such that coulomb blockade is absent .",
    "this implies energy levels of large width and a poorly defined electron number in the dot .",
    "moreover , the structures are large enough to allow an interpretation of the results within semiclassical pictures .",
    "we are not aware of a scheme for a purely magnetically confined qd which is weakly coupled to the environment .",
    "strong confinement can , however , be achieved by combining electrostatic with magnetic fields .",
    "the basic idea is to confine electrons to a quantum wire with electrostatic walls and form a qd by adding a suitable magnetic field profile in the longitudinal direction .",
    "this approach has been studied theoretically by reijniers et al .",
    "@xcite in the form of a quantum wire exposed to a longitudinal magnetic step where quantum states without a classical analogue have been predicted .",
    "this concept has been realized experimentally recently by a single magnetic barrier on top of a quantum wire and a superimposed homogeneous magnetic field .",

    "it is demonstrated that in this system , strong magnetic confinement can be achieved where all states are experimentally accessible via transport measurements .",
    "resonant tunneling dominates the transmission spectrum in the closed regime , while fano resonances are found in the open regime .",
    "furthermore , by changing the amplitude or the spacing of the magnetic barriers , or the distance of the 2deg from the ferromagnetic stripe , the shape of the confinement potential can be tuned .",
    "several authors have previously calculated the conductance of two magnetic barriers in series which confine electrons in a quantum wire , and resonances indicative of the energy spectrum of the resulting island were predicted .",
    "@xcite these structures have also been suggested as spin filters .",

    "the spectral density of the resonances increases with increasing @xmath4 and ( not shown ) as @xmath60 is decreased .",

    "@xcite on an open , electrostatically defined qd , where , however , the fano resonances showed larger asymmetries and a more homogeneous coupling .",

    "state 6 ( 11 ) is the lowest energy state belonging to the second ( third ) wire mode .",
    "while sharp resonances originate from states well localized close to the center of the dot , transmission via more extended states , e.g. state 8 , causes broad and highly symmetric resonances .",
    "one feature with potential experimental relevance of this system is that it allows to tune the confinement potential shape by experimentally controllable parameters , i.e. , by the spacing @xmath4 or the amplitude @xmath81 of the magnetic barrier , or the distance @xmath12 of the electron gas from the surface . in general ,",
    "the less the two magnetic barriers overlap , the steeper the effective confinement potential gets . while changing @xmath4 requires fabrication of several samples and @xmath12 can only be tuned by about @xmath82 in , e.g. , parabolic quantum wells embedded between a top and a back gate,@xcite @xmath81 can be tuned over wide ranges by changing @xmath15 .",
