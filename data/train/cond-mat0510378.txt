    "recently , there was an increasing interest to unconventional random matrix theories ( rmts ) that interpolate between the wigner - dyson rmt and banded rm with the ( almost ) poissonian level statistics .",
    "one of these models is the _ power law banded random matrix _ theory @xcite for which the variance of the off - diagonal elements takes the form : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the matrix size ; @xmath7 are two parameters which control statistical properties of plbrm .",
    "the variance ( [ varplperiodic ] ) is nearly constant inside the band @xmath8 , and decreases as a power - law function @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "the case @xmath11 corresponds to the power - law localization which can be found in certain periodically driven quantum - mechanical systems @xcite . if @xmath12 the spectral statistics of plbrm approaches that of the wigner - dyson rmt .",
    "the special case @xmath13 is relevant for description of critical systems with multifractal eigenstates @xcite , in particular for systems at the anderson localization - delocalization transition point . on the other hand",
    ", it has been conjectured @xcite that the spectral statistics of critical plbrm with large @xmath14 can be mapped onto the calogero - sutherland model ( cs ) [ ] at low temperature @xmath15 .",
    "according to this mapping instead of the spectral problem of random matrices one studies the statistics of one - dimensional fermions in a parabolic confinement potential interacting with the inverse square potential @xmath16 ( for real off - diagonal elements in plbrm , or _ the orthogonal ensemble _ ) or non - interacting ( for complex off - diagonal elements in plbrm with identical distribution of real and imaginary parts , or _ the unitary ensemble _ ) .",
    "however , there is an rmt for which the mapping onto the cs model is _ exact _ @xcite .",
    "this is the model of moshe , neuberger and shapiro ( mns ) [ ] .",
    "the probability distribution of the hamiltonian @xmath17 in mns is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 [ \\hat{u } , \\hat{{\\cal h } } ] ^{\\dagger } \\bigr )              \\biggr ) \\ , ; \\ ] ] the matrix @xmath20 is either unitary ( for @xmath21 from the unitary ensemble ) or orthogonal ( for @xmath21 from the orthogonal ensemble ) , and @xmath22 is the haar measure .",
    "the connection between plbrm and mns is especially clear in the unitary case @xcite where the unitary matrix @xmath23 can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation .",
    "then the variances of @xmath24 in mns at given phases @xmath25 are : @xmath26 one can easily see that eq.([varmns ] ) coincides with eq.([varplperiodic ] ) at @xmath27 if the phases @xmath28 are arranged as an ordered array on a circle .",
    "in general , the mns model can be considered as an extension of the plbrm model for the case of a random arrangement of phases @xmath29 distributed over the circle with the joint probability distribution @xmath30 [ ] : @xmath31 the averaged value of an observable @xmath32 , which is invariant under the transformation @xmath33 , can be calculated as : @xmath34 here @xmath35 stands for the averaging over the gaussian random matrix @xmath36 with entries having zero mean value and the variance given by eq.([varmns ] ) .",
    "the two - point correlation function , which follows from eq.([jpd ] ) after the integration over all but two phases , was calculated by gaudin with the help of the model of free non - interacting fermions with a linear spectrum @xcite : @xmath37 if @xmath38 , the correlation function is almost constant @xmath39 .",
    "there is a repulsion between phases at a small scale controlled by @xmath40 : @xmath41 .",
    "the level statistics of rmt is characterized by the density of states @xmath42 and its multi - point correlation functions .",
    "for example , the two - level correlation function @xmath43 is defined as : @xmath44 the fourier transform of @xmath43 is known as the spectral form - factor  @xmath45 : @xmath46 we rescale time by the mean level spacing @xmath47 introducing the dimensionless time @xmath48 . in the limit of small time",
    "the spectral form - factor @xmath49 is linked to the other important spectral characteristics called _ the level compressibility _",
    "@xcite : @xmath50 the meaning of @xmath51 is the following : let us take a window of the width @xmath52 , @xmath53 , in the energy space centered at @xmath54 and calculate the number @xmath55 of levels inside the window at some realization of disorder .",
    "the level number variance is @xmath56 . the level compressibility is by definition the limit @xmath57 the level compressibility contains an information about the localization transition : @xmath51 ranges from @xmath58 for the wigner - dyson statistics with extended wave functions and a strong levels repulsion to @xmath59 in the case of localized wave functions and uncorrelated levels with the poissonian distribution .",
    "the intermediate situation @xmath60 is inherent for the critical regime of multifractal wave functions @xcite .",
    "the exact expression for the level compressibility in the unitary mns reads @xcite : @xmath61 }                                                  { { \\rm li}_{+\\frac{1}{2 } } [ 1 - \\exp(2 \\pi b ) ] } \\simeq     \\left\\ {      \\begin{array}{l }            1/(4 \\pi b ) \\ , , \\ b \\gg 1 \\ , ; \\cr            1 - \\sqrt{2 } \\pi b\\ , , \\ b \\ll 1 \\ , ;      \\end{array }     \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the polylogarithm function @xcite .",
    "one can see that @xmath63 obeys an inequality @xmath64 , at any finite @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , the level statistics of mns and of critical plbrm are asymptotically the same in two limits : @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath68 , the theory of critical plbrm with @xmath69 can be rigorously developed by mapping @xcite onto the nonlinear supersymmetric @xmath70-model @xcite .",
    "one can show that the level statistics of critical plbrm approaches the wigner - dyson statistics @xcite .",
    "in particular , the level compressibility of plbrm goes to zero and asymptotically coincides with the compressibility for mns @xmath71 this is because the phase repulsion in mns is strong at large @xmath40 . the phases @xmath72 form an approximately equidistant lattice - like structure @xcite .    in the opposite case @xmath73 ,",
    "the phase repulsion in mns is weak and the phases @xmath72 do not form a regular structure .",
    "disorder in the phase arrangements at a small distances @xmath74 may become especially important and , therefore , there is no _ a priori _ evident correspondence between critical plbrm and mns at @xmath75 .",
    "let us consider the @xmath76 limit of eq.([varplperiodic ] ) at @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath77 the off - diagonal matrix elements of such a plbrm are parametrically small compared to the diagonal ones @xmath78 we will refer to eq.([model ] ) as to the _ almost diagonal critical _ plbrms .",
    "the parameter @xmath79 corresponds to the dyson symmetry classes : @xmath80 for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble , and @xmath81 for the gaussian unitary ensemble .",
    "this model can not be mapped onto the nonlinear sigma model as the mapping is only justified if @xmath68 . at @xmath77 , the compressibility of plbrm and mns are close to the poissonian value @xmath82 .",
    "the leading correction of the order of @xmath83 was derived in refs .",
    "[ ] using an approximation of two interacting levels first suggested in ref .",
    "surprisingly , disorder in the arrangement of mns phases does not influence @xmath51 and the compressibility for plbrm and mns are again asymptotically the same : @xmath84      a natural question arises as to whether the level rigidity of critical plbrm and mns coincide at an arbitrary @xmath85 .",
    "the numerical simulations @xcite did not exclude such a possibility .",
    "the main result of the paper is that it is not the case : the sub - leading corrections of order @xmath86 are different in those two models . to prove this statement we analytically calculate _ the second coefficient of the virial expansion _",
    "@xcite for the level compressibility for the critical plbrm of the unitary symmetry class and compare it with the exact result eq.([chimns ] ) for mns .",
    "as the analytical calculation is quite involved we undertook an extensive numerical investigation of the same problem and found an excellent agreement with the analytical prediction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we briefly discuss the virial expansion in section [ virial ] and re - derive eq.([chimnssmallb ] ) as the first virial coefficient in section [ virial-1 ] .",

    "we end the paper with a brief discussion and conclusions .",
    "the virial expansion ( ve ) is a method that allows to study spectral statistics of a disordered system described by a gaussian ensemble of the hermitian @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) almost diagonal random matrices which have random independent elements @xcite : @xmath89 it is an _ expansion in the number of interacting energy levels_. unlike the field - theoretical approach , ve starts from the poissonian statistics and yields a _ regular expansion _ in powers of the small parameter controlling the ratio of the off - diagonal elements to the diagonal ones @xmath90 . the expansion has been represented by the summation of diagrams which are generated with the help of the trotter formula .",
    "a rigorous selection rule has been established for the diagrams , which allows to account for exact contributions of a given number of resonant and non - resonant interacting levels .",
    "the method offers a controllable way to find an answer to the question when a weak interaction of levels can drive the system from localization toward criticality and delocalization .",

    "otherwise , ve fails and one has to take into account an infinite number of the interacting levels .",
