    "in the dense neutrino flux emerging from a supernova ( sn ) core , neutrino - neutrino refraction causes nonlinear flavor oscillation phenomena that are unlike anything produced by ordinary matter  @xcite .",
    "the crucial phenomenon is a collective mode of pair transformations of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents some suitable superposition of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this pair - wise form of flavor transformation leaves the net flavor - lepton number flux unchanged .",
    "even an extremely small mixing angle is enough to trigger this effect that is insensitive to the presence of ordinary matter unless there is a mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) resonance in the dense - neutrino region .",
    "collective pair transformations require a large neutrino density _ and _ a pair excess of a given flavor . in typical sn models",
    "one finds a hierarchy of number fluxes @xmath2 .",
    "the first part of the hierarchy is caused by the deleptonization of the collapsed core whereas the second is caused by the absence of charged - current interactions for neutrino species other than @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "the neutrino fluxes streaming from a collapsed star thus provide a natural environment for a flavor pair excess . on the other hand ,",
    "the sn core itself is characterized by a large @xmath0 chemical potential that enhances the @xmath0 density and suppresses that of @xmath10 so that here pair transformations can not occur .",
    "likewise , the deleptonization burst immediately after core bounce has an excess of @xmath0 and a depletion of @xmath10 @xcite , suggesting that it is unaffected by collective pair transformations .",

    "flavor oscillations do not change those parts of the flavor fluxes that are already equal , only the transformation of the excess @xmath10 flux over the @xmath20 flux is observable , and likewise for neutrinos .",

    "are nicely explained after recognizing that the equations of motion can be brought into a form where they are equivalent to a gyroscopic pendulum  @xcite . the initial `` plateau phase '' corresponds to synchronized oscillations or , in the pendulum language , to a fast precession .",
    "we call the radius where this phase ends the synchronization radius @xmath30 . the decline with `` wiggles '' represents a nutation mode .",
    "the overall decline is caused by the dilution of the neutrino flux and their increasing collinearity with distance , corresponding to a decline of their effective interaction energy .",
    "one salient feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : firstexample ] is that the @xmath10 flux completely converts to @xmath20 , whereas the @xmath0 flux converts to @xmath1 only to the extent allowed by the conservation of @xmath31 .",
    "this conservation is exact in the mass basis that approximately coincides with the interaction basis if the mixing angle is small . in other words ,",
    "only @xmath32 pairs convert to @xmath33 pairs , whereas the unpaired @xmath0 excess remains in its original flavor  @xcite .",
    "the current - current nature of the weak interaction causes the interaction energy to depend on @xmath34 for two trajectories with relative angle @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , neutrinos emitted in different directions from a sn core experience different refractive effects  @xcite . as a result , one would expect that their flavor content evolves differently , leading to kinematical decoherence between different angular modes  @xcite .",
    "two of us have recently shown that this multi - angle decoherence is indeed unavoidable in a `` symmetric gas '' of equal densities of neutrinos and antineutrinos  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "this effect is self - accelerating in that an infinitesimal anisotropy is enough to trigger an exponential run - away towards flavor equipartition , both for the normal and inverted hierarchies .    in the sn context , however , it has been numerically observed that the evolution is much more similar to the single - angle ( or the isotropic ) case  @xcite .",
    "the flux emitted by a sn is extremely anisotropic .",
    "if one assumes @xmath36 symmetry , flavor decoherence is swift and unavoidable .",
    "therefore , the observed suppression of multi - angle decoherence must be related to the @xmath32 asymmetry that is generated by sn core deleptonization .    to illustrate this point we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : example2 ] a few examples along the lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : firstexample ] , but now for multi - angle emission from the neutrino sphere that is again taken at 10  km .",
    "we consider different values of an asymmetry parameter that we define as @xmath37 where we have used @xmath38 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we can assume @xmath39 at the neutrino sphere without loss of generality .",
    "the left panels are for the normal hierarchy , the right panels for the inverted hierarchy .",
    "@xmath40 is constant so that it is sufficient to show @xmath41 alone .",
    "however , the length @xmath42 is no longer preserved : complete kinematical decoherence among the angular modes would cause @xmath43 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath44 remains fixed , this signifies that all modes evolve coherently with each other .",
    "we use @xmath13 rather than @xmath45 because the former measures what happens to the @xmath32 pairs , whereas the latter also includes the conserved @xmath0  excess .        in the top row",
    "we use @xmath46 ( symmetric case ) . the flavor content decoheres quickly as expected . both the length and the @xmath11-components of @xmath12 and @xmath13",

    "we show in the bottom row the same for @xmath15 . in the normal hierarchy , nothing visible happens , in analogy to the single - angle case . in the inverted hierarchy ,",
    "the transformation is similar , but not identical , to the single - angle case .",
    "the nutations wash out quickly . shortly after exiting from the synchronization phase , the length @xmath47 shrinks a bit , but stays almost constant thereafter .",

    "[ sec : decoherence ] , but multi - angle decoherence has certainly not occurred .    in the two middle rows we show intermediate cases with @xmath48 and 0.12 , respectively . for the inverted hierarchy ,",
    "these examples are qualitatively equivalent .",
    "the evolution is at first similar to the single - angle case and analogous to @xmath15 .",
    "the nutations are washed out and the length @xmath47 shrinks a little bit after the synchronization radius . at some larger radius",
    ", however , something new happens in that @xmath47 suddenly shrinks significantly , although not to zero , and there is a distinct feature in the evolution of the @xmath11-component .",
    "now we obtain partial decoherence .",
    "the final flavor content is very different from the single - angle case .    in the normal hierarchy , and for @xmath48",
    ", we obtain large decoherence that begins abruptly at some radius far beyond @xmath49 . for the larger asymmetry @xmath50 , the length @xmath51 also shrinks , but closely tracks @xmath52 .",
    "as we will see , this case is somewhat like phase  ii of the inverted - hierarchy case , i.e. , a certain amount of shrinking of the length of @xmath47 and thus a clear multi - angle effect , but no real decoherence .",
    "depending on the deleptonization flux , here represented by the asymmetry parameter @xmath4 , the system behaves very differently . in particular , for the inverted hierarchy it is striking that there are either two or three distinct phases .",
    "we always have the initial synchronized phase at large neutrino densities .",
    "next , there is always the quasi single - angle pair - transformation phase at distances larger than @xmath30 . just beyond this radius ,",
    "the global polarization vectors quickly shrink by a small amount , but then stabilize immediately .",
    "finally , if @xmath4 is below some critical value , there is a sharp transition to a third phase where the different angular modes decohere significantly , but not completely .",
    "the practical outcome for the flavor fluxes emerging from the dense - neutrino region is very different depending on @xmath4 .",
    "the transition between these regimes is abrupt , a small change of @xmath4 is enough to cause one or the other form of behavior .",
    "while these phenomena call for an analytic quantitative understanding , we are here less ambitious , but more practical .",
    "we study numerically for which range of parameters the different forms of behavior occur . towards this goal we first set up , in sec .",

    "our fundamental quantities are the flux matrices in flavor space @xmath53 that depend on the radial coordinate @xmath54 ( appendix  [ app : eom ] ) .",
    "the diagonal entries represent the total neutrino number fluxes through a sphere of radius  @xmath54 . in the absence of oscillations ,",
    "@xmath53 would not depend on the radius at all .",
    "the flux matrices are represented by polarization vectors @xmath55 in the usual way , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "antineutrino quantities are always denoted with an overbar .",
    "the number fluxes @xmath58 are understood at the neutrino sphere . in both equations the term proportional to the polarization vector is normalized to the antineutrino flux . as a consequence , at the neutrino sphere we have the normalization @xmath59 in this way , we treat the excess flux from deleptonization as an adjustable parameter without affecting the baseline flux of antineutrinos .    the diagonal part of the flux matrices is conserved and irrelevant for flavor oscillations .",
    "the polarization vector @xmath60 only captures the _ difference _ between the flavor fluxes .",
    "for this reason we have defined the asymmetry @xmath4 in terms of the flux differences .",
    "multi - angle effects are at the focus of our study .",

    "what is the impact of a large matter density in the region where neutrino - neutrino effects are important ? in the previous literature it was recognized that a constant matter profile essentially reduces the effective mixing angle so that matter should have the same influence as a small vacuum mixing angle  @xcite .",

    "we conclude that indeed we can ignore matter entirely if we account for it schematically by a small vacuum mixing angle , at least in the inverted hierarchy .",
    "moreover , the onset of collective pair transformations is only mildly changed by the choice of mixing angle .",

    "the exact matter profile is only important if it is so shallow that it causes an msw resonance in the dense - neutrino region , a case that we do not investigate .",
    "this discussion suggests that , at least for the inverted hierarchy , the actual vacuum mixing angle does not strongly influence the issue of multi - angle decoherence because this effect happens when the global polarization vector is tilted far away from the @xmath118 direction . on the other hand ,",
    "we have already noted that the quasi - coherent spiral structure that forms just beyond the synchronization radius has more windings for a smaller mixing angle so that the system is not identical .    to clarify the role of the mixing angle we have used our standard inverted - hierarchy case and have calculated the limiting asymmetry @xmath4 for decoherence for a broad range of mixing angles .",

[ fig : mixeps ] has a different meaning for the two hierarchies .",
    "as discussed earlier , in the inverted hierarchy , @xmath47 shortens somewhat even in the quasi single - angle regime .",
    "therefore , as a formal criterion for distinguishing the regions of coherence and decoherence we use that the final @xmath47 has shortened to less than 0.85 . the exact choice is irrelevant because the transition between the quasi - coherent and decoherent regimes is steep as a function of  @xmath4 .",
    "conversely , in the normal hierarchy , @xmath47 need not visibly shorten at all as illustrated by the example in the lower left panel of fig .",

    "the error bars represent our confidence range for the true critical value .",

    "the normal hierarchy is very different from the inverted one in that for a small mixing angle , all polarization vectors stay closely aligned with the @xmath11-direction unless multi - angle decoherence takes place .",
    "therefore , it is plausible that for a smaller mixing angle , decoherence effects are delayed .",

    "@xcite it was noted that the energy distribution of neutrinos and antineutrinos is largely irrelevant for the question of decoherence as long as the oscillations exhibit self - maintained coherence  @xcite .",
    "the multi - angle transition to decoherence typically occurs within the dense - neutrino region where the synchronization of energy modes remains strong .",

    "the crucial quantity to keep fixed is not the average energy , but the average oscillation frequency @xmath133 . if we assume that neutrinos and antineutrinos have equal distributions , it is straightforward to adjust , for example , the temperature of a thermal distribution such that @xmath134 is identical to our monochromatic standard case @xmath135 .",

    "the rotation frequency for the corotating frame is @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , our bichromatic system behaves equivalently to a monochromatic one with @xmath140 .",
    "it is trivial to show in numerical examples that the bichromatic system is indeed equivalent to a monochromatic one with @xmath136 taken as the simple average of @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",

    "we always found that the evolution of the global polarization vectors is almost identical to the equivalent monochromatic cases .",
    "we never observed that a broad energy spectrum caused a significant deviation from the monochromatic behavior at those radii that are relevant for decoherence .",

    "we now see that most of the antineutrinos have moved to the negative @xmath118 direction as before , whereas the neutrinos populate both the positive and negative @xmath118 direction , representing the spectral split .",
    "the lack of full adiabaticity prevents the split from being complete , leaving some polarization vectors not fully aligned or anti - aligned with @xmath118 . at large radii",
    "when the neutrino - neutrino interactions have died out , these modes precess with their different vacuum oscillation frequencies so that they are found on a spiral locus extending from the `` south pole '' to the `` north pole '' that gets wound up further at larger radii .",
