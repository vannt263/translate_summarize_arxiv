    "of particular interest recently are bilayers  @xcite ( and multilayers ) of graphene , where an added layer degree of freedom combines with spin and valley degrees to make the physics of graphene far richer .",
    "in particular , bilayer graphene has the property that its band gap is externally controllable .",
    "@xcite    quantum phenomena associated with dirac fermions become prominent in a magnetic field . in a magnetic field graphene",
    "supports a set of characteristic zero - energy landau levels , whose emergence and degeneracy have a topological origin in the nonzero index of the dirac operators , or in the chiral anomaly in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "@xcite monolayer graphene has four such zero - energy levels owing to the spin and valley degeneracy .",
    "bilayer graphene supports an octet of such zero - energy levels , due to an extra twofold degeneracy  @xcite in landau orbitals @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this orbital degeneracy brings about a new realm of quantum phenomena ,  @xcite such as orbital mixing and orbital - pseudospin waves .",
    "the eightfold degeneracy of the zero - energy levels is partially or fully lifted in the presence of zeeman coupling , interlayer bias and coulomb interactions , and these levels evolve into a variety of pseudo - zero - mode levels , or broken - symmetry states , as discussed theoretically in the context of quantum - hall ferromagnetism  @xcite and others .",
    "@xcite experimentally the full splitting of the pseudo - zero - mode levels has been observed  @xcite in bilayer graphene .",
    "a key feature of graphene is that graphene is an intrinsically many - body system of electrons equipped with the valence band that acts as the dirac sea .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the dirac sea are sizable and lead to such quantum phenomena as velocity renormalization ,  @xcite screening of charge ,  @xcite and nontrivial coulombic corrections to cyclotron resonance.@xcite it will be important to ask how such quantum fluctuations affect the pseudo - zero - mode sector in bilayer graphene , in order to interpret experimental results on broken - symmetry states properly ,    the purpose of this paper is to study the structure and spectra of the pseudo - zero - mode sector in bilayer graphene .",
    "it is shown , in particular , that the orbital degeneracy of the zero - energy levels is lifted by coulombic vacuum fluctuations , leading to an appreciable shift and splitting of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 levels ; this is a quantum effect analogous to the lamb shift@xcite in the hydrogen atom .",
    "this vacuum effect is correlated with the coulomb interaction within the pseudo - zero - mode octet to yield eventually a particle - hole symmetric spectrum for this octet .",
    "unexpectedly , a detailed analysis of the interlayer coulomb interaction reveals negative capacitance energies for bilayer graphene , which suppress possible valley rotations in the pseudo - zero - mode sector .",
    "we discuss how this sector is split in spin , valley and orbital , with filling , in the presence of zeeman coupling , interlayer bias and coulomb interactions , and compare with experimental results .    in sec .",

    "<S> in a magnetic field bilayer graphene supports an octet of zero - energy landau levels with an extra twofold degeneracy in landau orbitals @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that this orbital degeneracy is lifted due to coulombic quantum fluctuations of the valence band ( the dirac sea ) ; this is a quantum effect analogous to the lamb shift in the hydrogen atom . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed study is made of how these zero - energy levels evolve , with filling , into a variety of pseudo - zero - mode landau levels in the presence of possible spin and valley breaking and coulomb interactions , and a comparison is made with experimental results . </S>"
