    "it can thus be reasoned that one should search for physical theories which do not change in a qualitative matter under a small change of the parameters .",
    "such theories are said to be physically _",
    "stable_.    this concept of the physical stability of a theory can be given a mathematical meaning as follows .",
    "a mathematical structure is said to be mathematically stable for a class of deformations if any deformation in this class leads to an isomorphic structure .",
    "more precisely , a lie algebra is said to be stable if small perturbations in its structure constants lead to isomorphic lie algebras .",
    "the idea of mathematical stability provides insight into the validity of a physical theory or the need for a generalization of the theory .",
    "if a theory is not stable , one might choose to deform it until a stable theory is reached .",
    "such a stable theory is likely to be a generalization of wider validity compared to the original unstable theory .",
    "lie algebraic deformation theory has been historically successful .",
    "snyder @xcite in 1947 showed that the assumption that spacetime be a continuum is not required for lorentz invariance .",
    "framework however leads to a lack of translational invariance , which later in the same year , yang @xcite showed can be corrected if one allows for spacetime to be curved .",
    "yang , in the same paper also presented the complete lie algebra associated with the suggested corrections .",
    "it was mendes @xcite who in the last decade concluded that when one considers the poincare and heisenberg algebras together , the resultant poincare - heisenberg algebra is not a stable lie algebra .",
    "mendes showed however that the algebra can be stabilized , requiring two additional length scales .",
    "the stabilized algebra is the same as the algebra obtained by yang in 1947 .",
    "it was faddeev @xcite and mendes who noted that , in hindsight , stability considerations could have predicted the relativistic and quantum revolutions of the last century .",
    "chryssomalakos and okon @xcite showed that by a suitable identification of the generators , triply special relativity proposed by kowalski - glikman and smolin @xcite can be brought to a linear form and that the resulting algebra is again the same as yang s algebra .",
    "more recently , stability considerations have led to the stabilized poincare - heisenberg algebra ( spha ) as the favorite candidate for the lie algebra describing physics at the interface of gr and qm .",
    "chryssomalakos and okon @xcite showed uniqueness of the spha .",
    "incorporating gravitational effects in quantum measurement of spacetime events renders spacetime non - commutative and leads to modifications in the fundamental commutators @xcite . in 2005 , ahluwalia - khalilova showed that the fact that the heisenberg fundamental commutator , @xmath1=i\\hbar$ ] , undergoes non - trivial modifications at the interface of gr and qm , suggests quantum mechanics and relativity will undergo numerous corrections and modification including modification of the position - momentum heisenberg uncertainty relations . on top of this ,",
    "spacetime in spha requires two new length scales , one in the extreme short distance range , the other on the cosmological scale .",
    "we denote these new length scales @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively ( following the notation used in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , spha points to the existence of another dimensionless constant @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 in @xcite ) which , if nonzero , will radically affect some of the quantum relativistic notions .",
    "the presence of @xmath4 has been noted in @xcite with different emphasis .",
    "chryssomalakos and okon @xcite show that it is always possible to gauge away this dimensionless constant by a suitable redefinition of the generators .",
    "the overall meaning of @xmath4 seems to not be well understood in the literature .",
    "we show that clifford algebra allows one to obtain an explicit expression for @xmath4 in terms of an angle parameter @xmath6 .",
    "this is a step toward understanding how @xmath4 will affect various quantum relativistic notions .",
    "our approach to the spha is quite different in that we adopt a clifford algebra perspective .",
    "a physical theory should have its roots in the geometry underlying the theory and be represented in a way that captures this geometry accordingly .",
    "clifford ( geometric ) algebra is the appropriate tool that allows us to naturally encompass the underlying geometry of the space we are working in .",
    "although a brief overview of clifford algebra will be presented in section 3 of this paper , we omit any in - depth discussion of clifford algebra and how it arises from geometry .",
    "the reader is instead referred to the following texts by lounesto @xcite , hestenes @xcite and doran and lasenby @xcite .",
    "the spha has fifteen generators .",
    "we wish to represent these generators by elements of the clifford algebra @xmath0 which is a sixteen dimensional algebra .",
    "the non - scalar basis elements of @xmath0 can be used to generate the spha by taking commutators with the clifford product .",
    "( @xmath0 is chosen over @xmath7 or other sixteen dimensional clifford algebras for reasons explained in @xcite . )",
    "it is interesting to note that using this clifford algebra , one avoids all stability considerations .",
    "this is because the clifford algebra @xmath0 is semi - simple and therefore stable .",
    "some further discussion on this is reserved for the next section .",
    "ahluwalia - khalilova @xcite noted that incorporating gravitational effects in quantum measurement of spacetime events renders spacetime non - commutative and leads to modifications in the fundamental commutators .",
    "this non - commutativity of space - time and modifications to the fundamental commutators arise naturally from clifford algebra .",
    "there thus seems to be a number of reasons why one should consider using clifford algebra in theories of quantum gravity .",
    "since we are logically led to consider two additional length scales as well as a dimensionless constant in the proposed new algebra for kinematics at the interface of gr and qm , it is important to note that on heuristic grounds amelino - camelia @xcite and smolin @xcite have also considered such a path .",
    "however , in the work presented here such resulting modifications to the quantum and spacetime structure arise not as an ad hoc speculation but from the principle of lie algebraic stability .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for additional discussion of these and related issues .",
    "as noted by mendes @xcite and faddeev @xcite , in hindsight , the paradigm of algebraic deformations to obtain stable theories has the power to have predicted the relativistic and the quantum revolutions of the last century .",
    "this section will show how algebraic deformations lead from the poisson algebra of classical mechanics to the heisenberg algebra of quantum mechanics and from the galilean algebra of galilean relativity to the poincare algebra of special relativity .",
    "the theory of lie - algebraic deformations is not discussed in detail here . for a thorough and complete treatment the reader",
    "is referred to gerstenhaber @xcite , nijenhuis and richardson @xcite and chryssomalakos and okon @xcite .",
    "when considering the poisson and galilean algebras , one finds that the algebraic structures are unstable .",
    "it is however possible to stabilize both of the algebras .",
    "doing so requires two deformation parameters .",
    "these turn out to be the physical constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the galilean algebra and poisson algebra respectively .",
    "chryssomalakos and okon @xcite explain that both the galilean and poisson algebra cases , the deformed algebras are isomorphic for all non - zero values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the values of these deformation parameters are determined by experiment .",
    "neither the heisenberg nor the poincare algebras preserve their stability at the interface of gr and qm . a first attempt to find an algebra describing physics at the interface of gr and qm may be to take the direct sum of the poincare and heisenberg algebras to give the poincare - heisenberg algebra but this algebra however is not stable .",
    "mendes @xcite and chryssomalakos and okon @xcite have both emphasised that one of the important criteria to consider for a theory to be physically viable , is the stability of the underlying lie algebras , and so the poincare - heisenberg algebra fails to be the algebra we desire .",
    "the poincare - heisenberg algebra can however be stabilized , requiring two additional length scales and a dimensionless constant in the same manner that the stabilization of the algebras of galilean and classical kinematics requires two constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the resulting algebra is the stabilized poincare - heisenberg algebra ( spha ) , the algebra of kinematics at the interface of gr and qm .",
    "it will be shown later that the spha is precisely the algebra obtained by taking commutators of the elements of the clifford space - time algebra @xmath0 .",
    "as noted above , the stabilised poincare - heisenberg algebra comes from combining quantum mechanics and relativity to get a stable theory of kinematics at the interface of gr and qm .",
    "the algebra is given below in a similar form to that of chryssomalakos and okon @xcite ( which in turn is a somewhat more abstract and mathematical version than the one given by ahluwalia - khalilova @xcite which focuses more on the physical aspects of the algebra ) .",

    "as noted earlier , we do not have to concern ourselves with the issue of stability when using a clifford algebra .",

    "switching to a relativistic mindset , we know that we can no longer treat space and time separately but that in fact we have to consider them together in what we call spacetime .",
    "it is no longer possible to determine the time and position of an event absolutely .",
    "similarly , in a newtonian mindset , we can treat position and momentum separately and thus the above transformation may seem unphysical . in a quantum mechanical frame of mind however , we can not measure position @xmath44 and momentum @xmath45 with absolute certainty . the more accurately we know one , the less accurately we know the other as is described by the heisenberg uncertainty relationship @xmath99 .",
    "this suggests that we can not just think about position or momentum without considering the other .",
    "furthermore , making a measurement of the position of some particle will in itself affect the position .",
    "the photon used to measure the particle s position will give the particle some momentum . on the quantum scale",
