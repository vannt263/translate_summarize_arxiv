    "the level set method was first introduced by osher and sethian @xcite in 1987 , and it has had large impact on computational methods for interface motion . in the past years , the level set method attracted a lot of attention and was used for a wide variety of problems , including fluid dynamics , material sciences , computer vision and imaging processing . for an extensive exposition of the level set method , we refer readers to the review paper @xcite and the book @xcite .    in the level set method , the evolving family of interface @xmath1 , @xmath2 is represented implicitly as the zero level set of a continuous function which we will denote as @xmath3\\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}$ ] , where @xmath4 is a simply connected domain containing the whole family of evolving interfaces @xmath1 , @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the interface @xmath1 can be written as @xmath6 there are certain advantages associated with this implicit eulerian type of representation .",
    "* the level set formulation is unchanged in higher dimensions , that is , it is easy to extend to 3d . * topological changes such as merging and breaking in the evolving interface @xmath1",
    "are handled naturally .",
    "the level set formulation for willmore flow will typically result in a fourth order nonlinear partial differential equation ( pde ) , _",
    "e.g. _ see @xcite for details .",
    "_ developed a finite volume method for spatial discretization in @xcite .",
    "when the evolved surface is a graph , the willmore flow converts to willmore flow of graphs , and numerical methods for willmore flow of graphs attracted a lot of attention in the last decades . a semi - implicit numerical scheme for the willmore flow of graphs with continuous finite element discretization and the convergence analysis has been provided by deckelnick and dziuk in @xcite .",
    "finite difference discretization for the willmore flow of graphs has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "xu and shu @xcite developed a local discontinuous galerkin method for willmore flow of graphs , and time discretization was by the forward euler method with a suitably small time step for stability .",
    "the discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) method is a class of finite element methods using completely discontinuous basis functions , which are usually chosen as piecewise polynomials .",
    "it was first introduced in 1973 by reed and hill @xcite for solving the linear time dependent neutron transport equation .",
    "later , the dg method was developed for solving the nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws by cockburn _",
    "_ in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "these discontinuous galerkin methods were generalized to solve the pdes containing higher than first order derivatives , _",
    "i.e. _ the local discontinuous galerkin ( ldg ) method .",
    "the first ldg method was designed to solve a convection diffusion equation ( with second derivatives ) by cockburn and shu @xcite .",
    "the idea of ldg methods is to suitably rewrite a higher order pde into a first order system , then apply the dg method to the system .",
    "a key ingredient for the success of such methods is the correct design of interface numerical fluxes , which should be designed to guarantee stability . for a detailed description about the ldg methods for high order time dependent pdes , we refer the readers to @xcite .",
    "the dg and ldg methods have several attractive properties , for example :    1 .",
    "the order of accuracy can be locally determined in each cell , thus allowing for efficient @xmath0 adaptivity .",
    "2 .   these methods can be used on arbitrary triangulations , even those with hanging nodes , thus allowing for efficient @xmath7 adaptivity .",
    "these methods have excellent parallel efficiency .    in this paper",
    ", we present the level set method for computing evolution of the willmore flow of embedded surfaces , and one of the major advantages of level set method is their ability to easily handle topological changes .",
    "then we develop a high order local discontinuous galerkin method for solving level set formulation of the willmore flow .",
    "the basis functions of ldg method can be completely discontinuous , which leads that the order of accuracy can be locally determined in each cell , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath0-adaptivity . to improve the efficiency of the proposed methods , a @xmath0-adaptive technique is applied here to capture the evolution of the interface .",
    "another main difficulty when solving the willmore flow numerically is that it is stiff , and explicit time discretization methods suffer from extremely small time step restriction for stability , of the form @xmath8 , which is not efficient , especially for long time simulation .",
    "it would therefore be desirable to develop implicit or semi - implicit time marching techniques to alleviate this problem . in @xcite ,",
    "three efficient time discretization techniques were explored , these are the semi - implicit spectral deferred correction ( sdc ) method , the additive runge - kutta ( ark ) method and the exponential time differencing ( etd ) method .",
    "these methods are mainly based on a splitting of stiff and non stiff differential operators , which is particularly efficient for semi - linear pdes , but for quasi - linear equations , like for willmore flows , fully nonlinear solver would be required .",
    "thus we will employ here a high order semi - implicit runge - kutta method @xcite .    the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ se : level ] , we review the level set formulation for willmore flow and get a highly nonlinear fourth order pde . in section",
    "[ se : ldg ] , we present the formulation of the local discontinuous galerkin method and the @xmath0-adaptive technique for solving the willmore flow .",
    "section [ se : time ] contains a simple description of the high order semi - implicit runge - kutta method .",
    "numerical experiments are presented in section [ se : numerical ] , testing the performance of @xmath0-adaptive local discontinuous galerkin level set method for willmore flow .",
    "finally , we give concluding remarks in section [ se : con ] .",
    "in the level set method , the evolving family of interface @xmath1 , @xmath2 is represented implicitly as the zero level set of a continuous function @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the interface @xmath1 can be written as @xmath10 for the willmore flow , the level set function @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the speed of propagation of the level set function @xmath9 , turns into the following equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the shape operator on @xmath1 , @xmath15 is the mean curvature on @xmath1 and is given as @xmath16 in order to obtain the willmore flow , it is necessary to reformulate the equation in terms of @xmath17 , @xmath15 and their derivatives .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume that @xmath18 on @xmath1 .",
    "then the unit normal vector to a level curve of @xmath9 can be defined as @xmath19 let us denote the following auxiliary functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "then , by the derivation in @xcite , a level set formulation of willmore flow is given as follows : @xmath22 where the matrix @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 which is a projection into a tangential space of the curve representing the zero level set of @xmath9 .",
    "the willmore flow is subjected to the initial condition @xmath25 where the initial function @xmath26 is a signed distance function , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath27 , for any @xmath28 .",
    "the initial condition satisfies the following property @xmath29    one of the major advantages of level set methods is their ability to easily handle topological changes .",
    "however , we have found this not to be the case for willmore flow because of the lack of a maximum principle .",
    "indeed , two surfaces both undergoing an evolution by willmore flow may intersect in finite time .",
    "therefore , the level set formulation for willmore flow will lead to singularities in general , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath30 in finite time . to handle these difficulties",
    ", it is necessary to introduce a suitable regularization technique . for a fixed regularization parameter @xmath31",
    ", we define @xmath32 and replace all occurrences of @xmath33 in by @xmath34 .",
    "with the level set formulation for willmore flow , we need to discrete equation to capture the movement of the interface ( zero level set )",
    ". it would therefore be desirable to develop high order numerical scheme in both space and time to obtain high resolution . in this section",
    ", we will consider the local discontinuous galerkin ( ldg ) method for the willmore flow .",
    "we consider a subdivision @xmath35 of @xmath36 with shape - regular elements @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the union of the boundary faces of elements @xmath39 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .    in order to describe the flux functions , we need to introduce some notations",
    "let @xmath42 be an interior face shared by the `` left '' and `` right '' elements @xmath43 and @xmath44 and define the normal vectors @xmath45 and @xmath46 on @xmath42 pointing exterior to @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . for our purpose",
    "`` left '' and `` right '' can be uniquely defined for each face according to any fixed rule .",
    "for example , we choose @xmath47 as a constant vector .",
    "the left element @xmath43 to the face @xmath42 requires that @xmath48 , and the right one @xmath44 requires @xmath49 . if @xmath50 is a function on @xmath43 and @xmath44 , but possibly discontinuous across @xmath42 , let @xmath51 denote @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote @xmath54 , the left and right trace , respectively .",
    "let @xmath55 be the space of polynomials of degree at most @xmath56 on @xmath57 .",
    "the finite element spaces are denoted by @xmath58 and @xmath59 note that functions in @xmath60 , @xmath61 are allowed to be completely discontinuous across element interfaces .      to develop the local discontinuous galerkin scheme , we first rewrite the willmore flow as a first order system : @xmath62 with @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is given by the algebraic equation @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is solution to @xmath67 , where @xmath68 satisfies @xmath69 and finally @xmath70 . in equation , the matrix @xmath23 is given by @xmath71    next , we obtain the weak formulation of the exact solution . applying the ldg method to system , we get the following numerical scheme for the unknowns @xmath72 and @xmath73 , such that , for all test functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 where the previous algebraic relations between @xmath77 and @xmath78 are now written as @xmath79 moreover , @xmath80 is solution to @xmath81 where @xmath64 is now given with respect to @xmath66 @xmath82 and @xmath66 is solution to @xmath83 where @xmath84 are given with respect to the main unknown @xmath9 , that is , @xmath85 where @xmath23 and @xmath86 are computed by . here",
    "@xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the numerical fluxes . to complete the definition of the ldg method",
    ", we need to define these numerical fluxes , which are functions defined on the edges and should be designed based on different guiding principles for different pdes to ensure stability .",
    "similar to the development in @xcite , it turns out that we can take the simple choices such that @xmath92 we remark that the choice for the numerical fluxes is not unique .",
    "in fact , the crucial part is taking @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath91 from opposite sides , and @xmath90 and @xmath89 from opposite sides .",
    "the solution to the ldg scheme is mass conservative , by choosing the test function @xmath93 in equation .",
    "similar to the proof in @xcite , the solution to the ldg scheme with numerical fluxes satisfies the following energy stability @xmath94      in the level set method , we aim to capture the interface behavior . as a result",
    ", we are mainly interested in the position near the zero level set , which motivates us to use adaptive technique .",
    "the basis functions of the ldg method we discuss in this paper can be discontinuous , so it has certain adaptive flexibility , such as , the order of accuracy can be locally determined in each cell .",
    "our aim is to apply a higher order polynomial approximation around the zero level set to achieve high order accuracy , whereas in the regions far away from the zero level set , we apply lower order polynomial approximations , which is similar as what is described by yan and osher in @xcite .",
    "we explain the @xmath0-adaptive technique in detail with figure [ grid_adap ] . in figure",
    "[ grid_adap ] , we apply @xmath95 approximation near the zero level set , which are the domain filled with dark cells . while for the domain two or three cells away from the zero level set , it is not necessary to use high order approximation , thus @xmath96 approximation is enough .",

    "in this section , we employ a high order semi - implicit runge - kutta method .",
    "based on the work in @xcite , the main idea of the semi - implicit method is to apply two different runge - kutta methods . consider the ode system @xmath99\\\\   & u(0)=u_0 ,    \\end{aligned }    \\right .\\ ] ] where the function @xmath100 @xmath101 is sufficiently differentiable and the dependence on the second argument of @xmath102 is non - stiff , while the dependence on the third argument is stiff .",
