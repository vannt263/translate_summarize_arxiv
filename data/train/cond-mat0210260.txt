    "the interplay of quantum mechanics , disorder and reduced dimensionality is a central question in condensed matter physics .",
    "the issue becomes particularly interesting for materials near a _",
    "critical point ( i.e. one produced at temperature @xmath2 by variation of a control parameter such as pressure or chemical composition ) .",
    "near such a critical point , quantum fluctuations may become particularly strong , and may interact with randomness in an important way . in this paper , we consider the heretofore little studied question of the effect of quantum critical fluctuations on the residual resistivity of a metal .",
    "we consider two dimensional systems in which the criticality involves long wavelength fluctuations and find that the critical fluctuations lead to a singular , and possibly divergent , renormalization of the amplitude for an electron to backscatter off of an isolated impurity atom . for a system with a nonvanishing density of impurities , we find that this physics leads to a strengthening of the ` altshuler - aronov ' @xcite correction to the conductivity from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "renormalization of some electron - impurity vertices is expected in materials near density wave transitions ; for example , near a charge density wave transition , an impurity will produce density fluctuations whose component at the ordering wavevector will diverge as the transition is approached ( for an experimental demonstration , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , we show here that long - wavelength spin fluctuations can drastically increase backscattering by spinless impurities .",
    "our work is related to a previous analysis , by altshuler , ioffe .",
    "larkin , and one of us , of the staggered susceptibility of a model of electrons interacting with gauge fluctuations @xcite .",
    "our work is motivated by recent experiments on the bilayer ruthenate , @xmath1 , which apparently can at ambient pressure be tuned through a quantum critical point by variation of applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 has a layered crystal structure and highly anisotropic conductivity properties charactered by a very low in - plane ( ` ab ' ) resistivity ( @xmath5 as @xmath6 ) and a much higher out of plane ( ` c - axis ' ) resistivity ( @xmath7 as @xmath6 ) @xcite , so its electronic properties are to a good approximation two dimensional . at ambient pressure and no applied magnetic field",
    "the material is paramagnetic , but with a magnetic susceptibility @xmath8 which is strongly @xmath9dependent ( for @xmath10 ) and at low @xmath11 strongly enhanced above the band theory value @xcite .",
    "as applied magnetic field @xmath12 is increased at low @xmath11 ( @xmath13 ) resistivity measurements indicate that the material passes near to a critical point @xcite . in the vicinity of this critical point",
    "the differential magnetic susceptibility @xmath14 becomes large and the residual resistivity @xmath15 exhibits a pronounced cusp @xcite .",
    "the natural interpretation is that the transition observed in @xmath1 is _ metamagnetic _ in nature .",
    "metamagnetic materials exhibit a phase diagram in the field ( @xmath12)-temperature ( @xmath11 ) plane characterized by a line of first order transitions across which the magnetization jumps .",
    "the first order line ends in a critical point at temperature @xmath16 and field @xmath17 . in @xmath18 parameters",
    "are apparently such that at ambient pressure @xmath16 is very near to @xmath2 ( indeed for one field orientation it can be made to vanish exactly ) so that one has a _ quantum critical end point _",
    "a renormalization group theory of quantum critical end - points and their application to @xmath1 was given by @xcite ; in this paper we extend their theory to include electron - impurity coupling and use it to calculate the residual resistivity .",
    "in addition we make a few remarks about the applicability of our calculations to more general classes of critical points .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the critical theory , section iii gives the analysis of the renormalization of the born approximation amplitude for an electron to scatter off of an isolated impurity , section iv considers the single impurity problem beyond the born approximation and applies the results to @xmath1 , section v treats the extension to a non - vanishing density of impurities and section vi  is a conclusion and discussion of implications for other experiments .",
    "ref @xcite employed the standard approach of hertz @xcite and millis @xcite which involves integrating out electronic degrees of freedom to obtain an effective field theory with overdamped bosonic excitations , which is then analysed .",
    "this approach is presently the subject of debate @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "the theory is apparently inconsistent with data obtained on a variety of materials with antiferromagnetic critical points , and on the theoretical side the validity of integrating out gapless electronic degrees has been questioned @xcite , both two dimensional antiferromagnets and for ferromagnetic transitions involving an order parameter with continuous symmetry and time reversal invariance in the disordered phase .",
    "however , the assumptions made in @xcite do not apply to metamagnetic transitions , which involve an ising order parameter and an explicitly broken time reversal symmetry , nor do the fermi surface nesting complications of antiferromagnetic transitions @xcite apply here , because the order parameter is centered at @xmath0 .",
    "the order parameter for a metamagnetic critical point occurring at a field @xmath17 is the difference of the local magnetization density @xmath19 ( which we write here in space and imaginary time ) from the average value @xmath20 produced by the field @xmath17 at @xmath2 .",
    "( @xmath21 for @xmath1 . )",
    "it is convenient to measure the field and magnetization with respect to @xmath17 , @xmath20 , and to normalize the field to an energy scale @xmath22 ( discussed below ) and the magnetization fluctuations per @xmath23 via @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the high field saturation magnetization . in a clean ( non - disordered ) system",
    "the action describing the fluctuations of @xmath26 was argued @xcite to be ( @xmath27)@xmath28 + s_{dyn } \\label{s}%\\ ] ] with @xmath29 and , in a clean system,@xmath30 where @xmath31 . for @xmath1 , @xmath32 @xcite ; a value for @xmath33 has not been established .",
    "a natural guess would be something of the order of the in - plane lattice constant @xmath34 .",
    "however in many ferromagnetic materials band theory suggests that the momentum dependence of the magnetic polarizability is very weak , suggesting @xmath35 ; while if the considerations of @xcite are relevant a considerably larger value might be appropriate .",
    "a value for @xmath36 has also not yet been established ; the natural expectation is that it is of order the planar - band fermi velocity @xmath37 .",
    "the theory is above its upper critical dimension so the nonlinear term is a ` dangerously ' irrelevant operator and may be treated by standard means @xcite .",
    "we have written a two dimensional theory . at some scale",
    "a crossover to three dimensional behavior will occur , but present neutron experiments have so far been unable to observe any correlations along the c - axis @xcite . because the transition takes place in a magnetic field , the fluctuating field has ising symmetry and time reversal invariance is explicitly broken .",
    "neither ` precession ' terms in the dynamics nor the anomalous @xmath38 momentum dependence proposed in @xcite will occur .",
    "the action given in eq [ s ] describes the critical fluctuations . in the absence of critical fluctuations",
    "we take the action for electrons to be@xmath39 where @xmath40 represents the electrons with the `` spin '' index @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the electron dispersion and @xmath43 .",
    "the coupling between the electrons and the critical fluctuations can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath46-component of the pauli matrix .    to obtain the propagator @xmath47 describing the metamagnetic fluctuations we expand the action about the mean field value @xmath48 given by @xmath49 and read off the quadratic term , obtaining @xmath50 the coupling constant @xmath51",
    "may be determined because the damping term in @xmath52 arises from processes in which a critical fluctuation decays into one particle - hole pair @xcite and is @xmath53 with @xmath54 the length of the fermi surface in two dimensions ( @xmath55 for a circular fermi surface ) .        using these definitions",
    "we find that the one - loop self energy at @xmath2 , shown in fig 1a , is@xmath56 notice that as @xmath57 at fixed @xmath58 , @xmath59 while as @xmath60 at fixed @xmath61 we have @xmath62 .    in spatial dimension",
    "@xmath63 the fact that the theory is above the upper critical dimension guarantees that a one - loop ( migdal - like ) approximation yields an asymptotically exact approximation to the self energy , but in @xmath64 this is not the case @xcite .",
    "while higher corrections such as those shown in fig 1b do not change the powers , they do introduce a dependence on momentum @xmath65 and induce a dependence on @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "the scaling function for the self - energy has only been computed in large @xmath68 and small @xmath68 expansions where @xmath68 is the number of order parameter components .",
    "unfortunately , in the metamagnetic problem of interest here @xmath69 .",
    "we now consider the effect of critical fluctuations upon the amplitude , @xmath70 for an electron initially in a state of momentum @xmath71 to scatter off of an isolated impurity atom into a state of momentum @xmath72 the basic electron - impurity vertex is shown in fig 2a ; we assume that this is structureless ; corresponding to scattering amplitude independent of @xmath73 . the first correction due to critical fluctuations is shown in fig 2b , and is found to be divergent when @xmath73 are on the fermi surface and are such that the fermi surface tangents at these two points are parallel . for a circular fermi surface this condition corresponds to @xmath74 and @xmath75 in this case , choosing the @xmath76 coordinate to be parallel to @xmath71 and @xmath73 to be on the fermi surface we have @xmath77 and @xmath78 with @xmath79 a quantity of the order of @xmath80 parametrizing the curvature of the fermi surface .",

    "notice that if @xmath89 is the angle between @xmath71 and @xmath90 , then @xmath91 .",
    "a very similar result was obtained in the context of the @xmath92 gauge theory of the ` rvb ' regime of the two - dimensional @xmath93 model @xcite , where the @xmath94 spin susceptibility was considered .",
    "the @xmath92 gauge theory possesses an interaction ( mediated by an internal gauge field ) with a very similar mathematical structure to our interaction @xmath95 ( eq.[ddef ] ) , except that in the @xmath92 problem gauge invariance dictates that in the @xmath96 regime the mass ( @xmath97 in our notations ) vanishes .",
    "further , in the vertex computation two additional minus signs occur ( but compensate each other ) , one from the fact that gauge interaction involves currents which are oppositely directed at momentum transfer @xmath94 and one from the transverse nature of the gauge interaction .",
    "higher order diagrams such as those shown in fig .",
    "2c may be evaluated similarly ; we find that the leading behavior of the @xmath98 order term is @xmath99}\\right )   \\right ]   ^{n } \\label{an}%\\ ] ] so that finally we obtain @xmath100\\right )   ^{-\\psi } \\label{a}%\\ ] ] with @xmath101 at one loop order .",
    "we should further consider the effect of higher order diagrams , such as those shown in fig 2d . these do not change the basic power counting , and",
    "may therefore be expected not to alter the basic power law we have found ; they will however change the numerical value of the exponent . according to the result of small @xmath68 expansion @xcite , the effect of ` crossed diagrams ' is to increase the exponent .",
    "we conclude that the born - approximation amplitude for an electron to back - scatter off of an impurity suffers a singular renormalization near criticality .",
    "the previous section presented the renormalization of the leading - order term in the electron - impurity vertex . in this section",
    "we consider effects arising when the born approximation is not justified , either because the initial scattering amplitude is not small or because the renormalizations increase an initially weak interaction beyond the regime of validity of the born approximation .",
    "corrections to the born approximation result for the electron self energy correspond to multiple scattering of the electron off of the same impurity , and are represented diagrammatically in fig .",
    "3 . within the ` non - crossing ' approximation used in previous sections",
    "we find that the leading renormalization near criticality comes from the correcting each impurity vertex individually .",
    "the series for the self energy may be summed by defining the @xmath11-matrix which for incident electron energies very close to the fermi surface becomes    @xmath102    with @xmath103 the single - spin fermi surface density of states .",
    "assuming for simplicity a circular fermi surface with density of state @xmath104 we may solve the equation by resolving @xmath11 and @xmath105 into their angular components @xmath106 and @xmath107 so that @xmath108 we note that the sign of @xmath109 and therefore the sign of the angular momentum-@xmath110 channel phase shift alternates with @xmath110 , so that the friedel sum rule is straightforwardly satisfied .",
    "the final result depends on the parameter @xmath111 and on the exponent @xmath112 .  if @xmath113 , then none of the @xmath114 or @xmath109 are divergent as @xmath60 .",
    "the distance to criticality , parametrized by @xmath97 , controls the number @xmath115 of angular momentum channels for which @xmath114 and @xmath109 are non - negligible ( @xmath116 ) . on the other hand , if @xmath117 , then in each angular momentum channel the amplitude @xmath105 diverges as @xmath60 so that the resulting phase shift saturates at @xmath118 in each channel , and again the number of channels which are relevant diverges rather strongly as @xmath60 .",
    "the contribution of this scattering amplitude to the probability that an electron is scattered through an angle @xmath119 , @xmath120 is given by @xmath121 .",
    "the impurity scattering rate revealed by the resistivity , @xmath122 ( note that we have defined angular coordinates so that @xmath123 corresponds to backscattering ) . because we are concerned with a scattering amplitude strongly peaked about the back - scattering direction ,",
    "the @xmath124 factor is unimportant .",
    "then @xmath125 is given by the imaginary part of the diagonal @xmath9matrix @xmath126 in the usual approximation .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath127 + 2\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}\\operatorname{im}% t_{m}\\label{rhores}%\\ ] ] as noted above , within this approximation the resistivity diverges as criticality is approached , but the approximation itself breaks down when the mean free path implied by eq.[rhores ] becomes smaller than the correlation length .",
    "the question of a divergent resistivity is further examined in section vii .",
    "in this section we attempt to relate calculations of the @xmath97 dependence of @xmath128 to data obtained on @xmath129 we first note that it is sensible to discuss the scattering from an isolated impurity only if the elastic mean free path @xmath130 is greater than the correlation length @xmath131 .",
    "the observed low - t resistivity of clean samples of @xmath1 is of the order of @xmath132 corresponding to a @xmath133 , i.e. to an @xmath130 of the order of @xmath134 .",
    "the appropriate value of @xmath33 is not known at present , but if it is of the order of the lattice constant or smaller then almost all the available data are in the regime in which the calculation applies .",

    "three panels show the results of different initial scattering amplitude ( a ) @xmath138 ( well below unitarity limit for initial point - impurity scattering amplitude ) ( b ) @xmath139 ( roughly half way to unitarity limit ) ( c ) @xmath140 ( close to unitarity limit).,width=302,height=529 ]    @xmath1 presents an interesting issue in modelling .",
    "if the estimates presented in @xcite are correct , then even in zero field the material is close to a ferromagnetic critical point , so that renormalizations of impurity vertices could be substantial , even at vanishing applied field ( provided , of course , that a sufficiently wide regime exists in which the @xmath141 effects of @xcite are not important ) .",
    "what is unambiguously measurable , however , are the effects caused by a varying magnetic field .",
    "further , the parameters presented in @xcite allow a quantitative determination of the parameter @xmath97 above in terms of the applied magnetic field .",
    "we have used the parameters @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 defined and given below eq.6 of @xcite to compute the ` mass ' in eq.[ddef ] for applied fields from @xmath145 to @xmath146 , and have used this and eq.[rhores ] to calculate the field dependence of the residual resistivity for various choices of exponent @xmath112 and initial scattering amplitude .",
    "representative results are shown in fig.4 .",
    "the values at applied field @xmath147 depend on the behavior of the theory at higher energy scales , which is not known for the reasons given above .",
    "however , the change in behavior near the metamagnetic field ( about @xmath148 for the parameters used here ) should be reliable .",
    "we observe that there is some interplay between exponent and initial scattering strength but that sharpness and relative height of the resistivity peak depend most strongly on the exponent .",
    "comparison to data @xcite shows that our calculation is consistent with a moderate bare scattering amplitude and an exponent @xmath149 .",
    "we also note that the rather small resistivities observed in experimental systems suggest either that the initial scattering amplitude is weak or that the renormalizations associated with the nearby ferromagnetic quantum critical point are not large , perhaps for the reasons given in @xcite .",
    "the physics which gives rise to this correction to the conductivity also gives rise to a singular behavior @xcite in the susceptibility at wavevector @xmath150 and it is proportional to @xmath151 ; this leads to a change in amplitude and distance dependence of the friedel oscillations induced by an impurity in two dimensions .",
    "we find that if @xmath152 the friedel oscillations decay as @xmath153 while it is @xmath154 when @xmath155 .",
    "notice that it decays slower ( faster ) than the standard @xmath156 form if @xmath157 ( @xmath158 or @xmath117 ) . at non - zero field ,",
    "the spin up and spin down fermi surfaces are characterized by different fermi wave vectors so we predict two superposed oscillations emerging from each impurity site , each decaying with a characteristic power .",
    "these oscillations should be observable in stm experiments .",
    "we note , however , that the effect discussed here is a long wavelength , low energy effect . it does not imply that the density modulations are greatly enhanced near to an impurity ; only that they decay much less ( or more ) rapidly with distance than in a non - critical material .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the situation at @xmath147 , i.e. near to a 2d ferromagnetic transition , and indeed we note that for the @xmath1 parameters given in @xcite , @xmath147 corresponds to @xmath159 so one might expect the enhancements to be noticeable even at zero field .",
    "the friedel oscillations from a non - magnetic impurity would indeed be long ranged , however it is interesting to note that the rkky interactions are suppressed ( in a system with heisenberg symmetry ) because the spin commutation relations lead to a minus sign in the renormalization of @xmath160 vertex by @xmath161 or @xmath162 fluctuations .",
    "we also note that field - dependent stm studies might present an interesting test of the result @xcite that for 2d heisenberg materials the leading momentum dependences is @xmath163 . in this case",
    ", the renormalizations we have discussed would not exist .",
    "as @xmath12 is increased , the effects that produce @xmath163 are believed to be cut off , and the unconventional friedel oscillations should reappear .    finally , we observe that the presence of the friedel oscillations implies that the state of a critical system is in some sense a random charge density wave , characterized by infinite ranged charge oscillations emerging from the various impurity sites .",
    "the resistivity and other properties of such a state are an interesting issue for future research .",
    "the preceding treatment is valid for correlation lengths less than the mean free path .",
    "we now consider what happens when parameters are tuned so that the correlation length @xmath164 exceeds the mean free path @xmath130 .",
    "we first note that the problem has two energy scales : the impurity scattering rate @xmath165 and the characteristic quantum critical frequency @xmath166 so that near criticality , when @xmath167 we have @xmath168 .    for length scales",
    "longer than the mean free path the dynamic term in the action is modified to be @xcite @xmath169 with @xmath170 of the order of the diffusion constant @xmath171 .",
    "we note @xmath172 from the definition of @xmath173 in eq.[gdef ] . here",
    "@xmath174 is the impurity scattering rate , @xmath175 is the renormalized squared impurity scattering strength ( renormalized due to the effects discussed in section iv ) , and @xmath176 is the density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "thus the dynamical critical exponent is @xmath177 in this case and the nonlinearity in the critical theory remains dangerously irrelevant .",
    "the leading order correction to the conductivity is given by the sum of two diagrams in fig.5 @xcite , where the wavy line represents the metamagnetic fluctuations with the propagator @xmath178 .",
    "notice that there exist three more diagrams at the same order , but they cancel each other @xcite .",
    "each interaction vertex that represents the coupling between the electrons and the bosonic mode is renormalized by the diffuson correction , @xmath179 . after evaluating these diagrams",
    "we find that the leading correction to the dc conductivity at nonzero temperature is given by ( we assume @xmath180 ) @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "notice that these results are valid as far as we are in the perturbative regime , i.e. , @xmath184 .",
    "the physical content of eqs [ cond1],[cond2 ] is that as field is varied at a fixed , low , temperature the resistivity will initially increase as the critical point is approached , but sufficiently close to the critical point ( i.e. when @xmath185 with @xmath186 ) resistivity will level off at a temperature dependent but field - independent value .",
    "6 presents a qualitative sketch of the predicted behavior , including both the single - impurity regime of the previous sections and the altshuler - aronov regime considered in this section .     at a fixed temperature . here",
    "@xmath187 is the crossover field at which the mean free path becomes less than the correlation length and the single - impurity results of section iv break down , while @xmath186 is the field scale beyond which the field dependence is cut off by thermal effects .",

    "ii ) if @xmath193 , the coefficient of the logarithmic term explicitly depends on @xmath97 and it increases as the critical point is approached until it is cut off by temperature .    now let us estimate the size of the perturbative quantum correction in @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that @xmath194 and @xmath33 is of the order of the in - plane lattice constant @xmath195 . using @xmath196 and @xmath197 , we get @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",

    "if the material were more dirty , say @xmath208 , we would get @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "similar estimation would predict that the relative correction is @xmath211 at @xmath212 . it would be interesting to test these predictions in more dirty samples .    to conclude this section",
    "we note that the scattering time @xmath213 is the impurity scattering rate , _ as renormalized by critical fluctuations at scales less than the ( renormalized ) @xmath130_. we also observe that our result is perturbative in both the disorder strength and the interaction . presumably when the resistivity becomes of the order of the mott value a crossover to insulating behavior occurs .",
    "the insulating state should presumably be interpreted in terms of the random charge density wave state discussed at the end of section vi , but the issue deserves more careful investigation .",
