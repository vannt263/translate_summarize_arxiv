    "the confirmation of their optical counterparts is currently a very time consuming process .",
    "first , an extremely deep vla radio image is desirable , to give a sub - arcsec position for the submm galaxy .",
    "an optical redshift must then be found ( e.g. ivison et al .",
    "1998 ) , before a mm - wave interferometric detection of co molecular line emission at the same redshift confirms the identification unequivocally ( frayer et al .  1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "the observing time involved in this identification process is up to ten times greater than that required to detect each submm - luminous galaxy . in future mm / submm - wave surveys , using for example the wide - field bolocam bolometer array camera ( glenn et al .",
    "1998 ) , the detection rate of galaxies should increase from a few per night to several per hour . hence , even with access to the very finest facilities , this follow - up procedure will be completely inadequate to keep up with the growing catalog of submm galaxies .    here",
    "we discuss how observations of dusty galaxies using future facilities over the next few years  in particular bolocam , the long - wavelength mips instrument on _ sirtf _ and the upgraded vla  can be combined to provide redshift information without recourse to optical telescopes . despite the large detection rate",
    ", the classification and identification of the most interesting detected galaxies for detailed follow - up observations should be able to keep pace .",
    "three galaxies detected in submm surveys have sure identifications , as well as two cd galaxies detected in clusters ( edge et al .",

    "an important goal is to extend the size of the sample of submm - selected galaxies , and to identify a larger number . a wide range of powerful mm , submm and fir instruments that are suitable for carrying out surveys ( see table1 ) will become available over the next decade .",
    "some of their specifications are listed in table1 , along with the rate at which these instruments should be able to survey the sky and the depth at which they are expected to be affected by confusion noise . in fig.4 the detection rate of galaxies that could be achieved using these instruments are shown .    note that while the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) is a very powerful survey instrument , it will be most important for making resolved images of the galaxies detected using alll the other facilities .",
    "planck surveyor _ microwave background imaging satellite will also provide a very valuable all - sky survey at wavelengths between 10 mm and 350@xmath0 m .",
    "detection rates of order 100hr@xmath2 are expected in future mm / submm - wave surveys , probing galaxies at @xmath3 , as compared with the current rate of about 0.2hr@xmath2 .",

    "the speed presented is the mapping rate required to reach a 5-@xmath5 detection at a depth of 10mjy , which depends on the square of the detection flux density limit .",
    "the confusion noise is defined as the flux at which there is one source per beam ( see fig.3 ) . the ism confusion ( in brackets )",

    "a common broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can describe most submm - selected galaxies : see fig.1 in blain ( 1999 ; this volume ) .",
    "there are several possible ways to derive photometric redshifts from radio , mm , submm and fir photometry assuming this sed , which has a very generic form at wavelengths longer than about 60@xmath0 m .",
    "1 .   the radio  submm spectral index . as discussed by carilli & yun ( 1999 ; 2000 ) and blain ( 1999 ; this volume ) , the spectral break between non - thermal synchrotron emission and thermal dust emission , which typically occurs at a restframe wavelength of about 3 mm , can be used to provide redshift information .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the dust temperature can be determined reasonably accurately using this method : see smail et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for an application .",
    "2 .   the position of the peak of the dust sed .",
    "measurements at wavelengths on both sides of the redshifted peak of the dust sed can be used to fix the quantity @xmath8 .",

    "1998 ; barger et al .",
    "1999b ; ivison et al .",
    "2000 ) , but more distant galaxies should typically be optically fainter , because of the very different @xmath10-corrections in each band . this information could be used to provide a coarse indication of redshift .",
    "mid - ir ( mir ) and near - ir spectral features can be exploited to provide redshift information .",
    "this is outside the scope of this paper : see xu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and simpson & eisenhardt ( 1999 ) for more information .",
    "the issue of cross identification between surveys at different wavelengths should not be too challenging . at the relevant wavelengths of 1.1 mm ( cso - bolocam ) and 160 , 70 and 24@xmath0 m ( _ sirtf_-mips ) ,",
    "the angular resolution of the survey maps will be well matched , at about 30 , 45 , 20 and 7arcsec respectively .",
    "the sub - arcsec positional accuracy of a vla detection will allow a counterpart source to be sought in deep optical and near - ir images .",
    "new instruments that will be coming into service over the next few years are listed in table1 . of these",
    "the most timely and powerful are bolocam , _ sirtf _ and the upgraded vla , which will cover the mir / fir , mm and radio wavebands . however , the disparate mapping speeds of each instrument mean that different combinations of overlapping surveys will be required .",
    "to best exploit the capabilities of _ sirtf _ and bolocam , there seem to be three clear survey strategies . the photometric redshift information that can be derived from each survey is shown in the 3 panels of fig.5 .    1",
    ".   a 1.1-mm bolocam survey at the 10-m cso mapping at the most efficient depth , 5-@xmath11mjy ( fig.4 ) . about 4 galaxies per hour should be detected , and ultimately about 50hr@xmath2 at the 50-m lmt .",
    "these mm - wave surveys will be a very efficient way to detect high - redshift galaxies ; almost all of the detected sources should be at @xmath12 , about 50% at @xmath13 , and about 10% at @xmath14 ( barger et al .",
    "1999a ; blain et al .",
    "a 160-@xmath0 m _ sirtf _ survey to an efficient detection depth of 100mjy ( fig.4 ) , surveying about 3deg@xmath15 per hour and detecting about 300 galaxies per hour .",
    "this survey exploits _ sirtf _",
    "s longest wavelength band to boost the number of high - redshift galaxies detected ; 80% of the detected sources are expected to be at @xmath12 , and about 10% at @xmath13 .",
    "a 70-@xmath0 m _ sirtf _ survey to a confusion limited depth of 3mjy .",
    "this will yield a tremendously large number of sources , at a rate of about 6000hr@xmath2 .",
    "a shallower wider survey in this band would lead to an even greater detection rate : see fig .",
    "about 60% of the detected galaxies are expected to be at @xmath16 , and about 5% at @xmath13 .      by making coupled fir / mir _ sirtf _ observations of cso - bolocam survey fields ,",
    "the form of the sed of the detected galaxies will be constrained . at 160 and 70@xmath0 m , about 9 and 23% of the time spent surveying at 1.1-mm",

    "m and 8@xmath0 m , using the upgraded vla , mips and irac respectively , 10% of the 1.1-mm integration time will yield deep , unconfused maps to a 5-@xmath5 depth of 70@xmath0jy , 2mjy and 0.15mjy respectively . at the top of fig.5",
    "the efficiency of combining all this data to generate photometric redshifts can be seen .",
    "the radio  submm flux density ratio will typically provide useful information on the value of @xmath17 if @xmath18 , while the _ sirtf_-mips data is useful to @xmath19 .",
    "note that the sources detected will be several times brighter than the existing scuba galaxies .",
    "deep alma high - resolution imaging of sources not detected in the initial vla survey can be carried out in 1-min integration .",

    "sirtf_. at this sensitivity , detections should be obtained for all values of @xmath20 ( see the middle of fig.5 ) ; however , the shallow slope of the radio  fir flux density ratio means that the photometric redshift information derived will be relatively noisy . from fig.5 , 5-@xmath5 sensitivities of about 20 and 3mjy are required to detect a 100-mjy 160-@xmath0 m source for interesting values of @xmath20 . maps to this sensitivity can be obtained in the 70- and 24-@xmath0 m mips channels in 100% of the time allocated to the 160-@xmath0 m survey .",
    "mm - wave bolocam observations can not be made over the whole 160-@xmath0 m _ sirtf _ survey field to a depth sufficient to detect 160-@xmath0 m sources at interesting flux densities in a reasonable time , even at the lmt .",
    "although the detection rate of galaxies in a 70-@xmath0 m _ sirtf _ survey will be very large , the survey will be impossible to follow - up in its entirety at other mm / fir wavelengths until the arrival of the alma and _",
    "specs_. however , in a time - matched survey , the vla could reach a 5@xmath5 depth of 4.7@xmath0jy , detecting and providing an accurate position for _ sirtf _",
    "70-@xmath0 m sources for all values of @xmath20 ( see bottom of fig.5 ) .",
    "a lmt - bolocam survey could cover the same area to a 5-@xmath5 depth of 0.5mjy in the same integration time , sufficient to provide redshift information if @xmath21 .",
    "the alma has excellent sensitivity , and so follow - up imaging observations to resolve the detected sources will be very rapid ( see blain 2000 ) .",
    "this will also be true for the _ specs _ space interferometer .",
    "sirtf_-irac camera , operating at its longest wavelength of 8@xmath0 m will also be a very powerful instrument for detecting distant galaxies .",
    "however , because the models here are tuned to make predictions at longer wavelengths , refer to eisenhardt ( 1999 ; this volume ) for predictions of the performance of irac .",
    "the first generation of submm surveys have now resulted in significant understanding of dust obscuration in the high - redshift universe , but only a few examples of well studied submm - selected star - forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei are known . within the next few years bolocam and _ sirtf _ should dramatically increase the size of samples . by carefully combining the surveys made by these instruments and the upgraded vla , photometric redshifts should be available for up to 90% of the detected galaxies , thus providing information with which to test models of galaxy evolution and to prioritize follow - up observations .",
