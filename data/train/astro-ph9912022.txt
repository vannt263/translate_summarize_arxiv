    "globular clusters contain about one hundred times more low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) per unit mass than does the galaxy as a whole ",
    "the galaxy , with a mass of @xmath6 , contains about 100 lmxbs , whereas the galactic globular cluster population , with a total mass of just @xmath7 , contains at least 10 .",
    "all known cluster lmxbs have neutron stars as primaries .",
    "one might seek an explanation for this discrepancy in lmxb numbers in the obvious population differences between globular clusters and the galactic disc .",
    "the disc contains a mixture of stellar populations , with broad ranges in age and metallicity , while all stars in a given globular cluster have essentially the same age and initial composition .",
    "conceivably , a globular cluster might experience a characteristic `` lmxb - rich '' epoch as its component stars evolved .",
    "this hypothesis , however , is not widely accepted .",
    "a more likely explanation for the excess of lmxbs in globular clusters lies in the radically different dynamics of cluster stars compared to stars in the galactic disc .",
    "the mean stellar density in the disc is about 0.1 star per cubic parsec , with relatively little variation from place to place .",
    "globular clusters , on the other hand , exhibit a huge spread in densities , ranging from values close to the density in the disc near the cluster tidal radius , to tens of millions of stars per cubic parsec in the densest cluster cores .",
    "these density differences may be responsible for the higher birthrate of lmxbs in globular clusters relative to the galactic disc  dynamical interactions favor the formation of lmxbs .    for a cluster age of @xmath810 gyr ,",
    "neutron stars are more than twice as massive as other cluster members .",
    "dynamical friction causes them to sink to the center of the cluster potential well , where stellar densities are higher and encounters are much more common . once in the core , close encounters with other stars",
    "may lead to two - body tidal capture ( fabian et al . 1975 ) or to three - body exchange interactions ( phinney & sigurdsson 1991 ) . in either case",
    ", the neutron star gains a low - mass companion , which later evolves to become the donor in an lmxb .",
    "high kick velocities imparted to newborn neutron stars cause the majority to be ejected from their parent clusters upon formation ( davies & hansen 1998 ) . only about 20% of neutron stars",
    "are retained by globular clusters , yet cluster lmxbs still greatly outnumber the population in the galactic disc . mass segregation and",
    "tidal capture or exchange are evidently very efficient processes .    given this reasoning",
    ", it is all the more striking that no black - hole x - ray binaries are observed in globular clusters .",
    "black holes do not receive a kick upon formation in a supernova ( white & van paradijs 1996 ) , so hardly any escape promptly .",
    "black holes are also considerably more massive than neutron stars , causing them to sink in the cluster core even more rapidly . in equipartition ,",
    "the black holes velocity dispersion is @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the cross section for a dynamical interaction , which is dominated by gravitational focusing , is @xmath10 hence , for a black hole mass of 10 , we would naively expect that globular clusters should contain almost an order of magnitude more lmxbs with black holes than with neutron stars .",
    "however , none are found .",
    "the explanation for this discrepancy is as follows .",
    "the initial mass function of globular clusters is well described by a scalo ( 1986 ) distribution , with lower and upper limits of 0.1 and 100 .",
    "this imf has a mean mass @xmath11 and leads to the formation of about @xmath12 black holes per star .",
    "a @xmath13 star cluster thus produces about 1000 black holes .",
    "black holes resulting from stellar evolution are generally quite massive objects : known black hole masses range from 6 to 10 . for clarity",
    "we adopt a black hole mass of @xmath14 ; the precise value is not crucial to our discussion , so long as it significantly exceeds @xmath15 .",
    "as with neutron stars , dynamical friction causes the black holes to sink to the cluster core .",
    "the mass segregation time scale is @xmath16 half - mass relaxation times , or about @xmath17 yr for @xmath18 and a cluster relaxation time of @xmath19 years ( see kulkarni et al .",
    "1992 and sigurdsson & hernquist 1992 for details ) . as mass segregation proceeds and the cluster core contracts , binaries are formed , providing the energy needed to support the core against further gravothermal collapse ( heggie 1975 ) .",
    "the black holes will preferentially form binaries with one another , both because it is energetically favorable for them to do so , and because of the generally larger black - hole interaction cross sections .",
    "subsequently , the black - hole binaries evolve via dynamical encounters with other cluster components . on average",
    ", each encounter between a black - hole binary and a single black hole hardens the binary ( increases its binding energy ) by about 20% .",
    "two - thirds of the energy released goes into binary recoil , the rest into recoil of the other black hole involved in the interaction .",
    "the hardening process continues until the recoil velocity exceeds the clusters escape speed and the black - hole binary is ejected from the cluster .",
    "a binary can release enough energy to eject itself from the cluster once its binding energy exceeds @xmath20 times the mean kinetic energy of cluster stars . by this time",
    "the binary has typically experienced some 4050 hard encounters .",
    "the recoil energetics imply that , on average , a black - hole binary is ejected after its _ previous _ encounter has already ejected a single black hole .",
    "thus , for each ejected black - hole binary one expects two single black holes to be ejected .",
    "there are two possible dynamical scenarios for binary ejection : ( 1 ) there will be at most one or two black - hole binaries in the core at any given time , and a new binary can form only after these are ejected ; or ( 2 ) the core is able to support a large population of black - hole binaries .",
    "in the former case , the ejection process takes considerably longer , as the binaries are ejected sequentially . in the latter ,",
    "the binaries may be ejected more or less simultaneously .",
    "our simulations are not sufficiently detailed to discriminate between these alternatives .    in order to eject a black - hole binary following an encounter with a low - mass cluster member",
    ", the binding energy of the black - hole binary must exceed @xmath21 .",
    "however , by this time , the black - hole binary has shrunk to such a small orbital separation that it likely merges due to emission of gravitational wave radiation before another encounter takes place . on the other hand , the black - hole binary easily ejects low mass stars .",
    "the black hole binary starts to eject low mass stars as soon as its binding energy exceeds @xmath22kt .",
    "at least 20 low mass stars are ejected for each single black hole .",
    "the energy of an ejected binary and its orbital separation are coupled to the dynamical characteristics of the star cluster . for a cluster in virial equilibrium , we have @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the total cluster mass and number of stars , respectively , and @xmath26 is the virial radius . a black - hole binary with semi - major axis",
    "@xmath27 has @xmath28 and therefore @xmath29 we can thus compute the properties of black - hole binaries produced by globular clusters of given masses and virial radii .",
    "these cluster parameters are assumed to be distributed as independent gaussians with means and dispersions of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively ( djorgovski & meylan 1994 ) .",
    "a recent parameter - space survey of cluster initial conditions ( takahashi & portegies zwart 2000 ) finds that typical globular clusters which have survived for a hubble time have lost @xmath32% of their initial mass and have expanded by about a factor of three .",
    "we correct for this by changing the adopted distributions to @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "an approximate formula for the merger time of two stars due to the emission of gravitational waves is given by peters & mathews ( 1963 ) : @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the orbital eccentricity of the black hole binary . about 90% of the black - hole binaries formed in the cores of star clusters merge within a hubble time due to gravitational radiation .",
    "this fraction is based on the assumption that the binary binding energies are distributed flat in @xmath37 between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , that the eccentricities are thermal , independent of @xmath40 ( these assumptions are supported by detailed @xmath25-body simulations of smaller systems ) , and that the universe is 15gyr old ( jha et al.1999 ) . the specific contribution to the total merger rate of black - hole binaries from globular clusters is then about 0.04 per star cluster per million years .",
    "we estimate the number density of globular clusters in the universe to be @xmath41 where @xmath42 . combining the specific number density of globular clusters with their contribution to the black hole merger rate results in a total rate density of black hole mergers in the universe of @xmath43 we note that this figure is larger than the current best estimates of the neutron - star merger rate @xmath44 ( narayan et al .",
    "1991 ; phinney 1991 ; portegies zwart & spreeuw 1996 ) .",
    "the current best estimate of the maximum distance within which ligo - i can detect an inspiral event is @xmath45 ( k.  thorne , private communication ) . here , the `` chirp '' mass for a binary with component masses @xmath46 and @xmath47 is @xmath48 . for neutron star inspiral , @xmath49 , so @xmath50 , @xmath51 mpc . for black - hole binaries with @xmath52 , we find @xmath53 , @xmath54 mpc , and a ligo - i detection rate of about 1.7@xmath55 per year . for @xmath56 ( jha 1999 ) ,",
    "this results in about one detection event every two years . ligo -",
    "ii should become operational by 2007 , and is expected to have @xmath57 about ten times greater than ligo - i , resulting in a detection rate 1000 times higher  roughly one event per day .",
    "black - hole binaries ejected from galactic nuclei , the most massive globular clusters ( masses @xmath58 ) , and globular clusters which experience core collapse soon after formation tend to be very tightly bound , have high eccentricities , and merge within a few million years of ejection .",
    "these mergers therefore trace the formation of dense stellar systems with a delay of a few gyr ( the typical time required to form and eject binaries ) , making these systems unlikely candidates for ligo detections , as the majority merged long ago",
    ". this effect may reduce the current merger rate by an order of magnitude , but more sensitive future gravitational wave detectors may be able to see some of these early universe events .",
    "in fact , we estimate that the most massive globular clusters contribute about 90% of the total black hole merger rate . while their black - hole binaries merge promptly upon ejection , the longer relaxation times of these clusters mean that binaries tend to be ejected much later than in lower mass systems .",
    "consequently , we have retained these binaries in our merger rate estimate .",
    "we have assumed that the mass of a stellar black hole is 10 .",
    "increasing this mass to 18 decreases the expected merger rate by about 50%higher mass black holes tend to have wider orbits . however , the larger chirp mass increases the signal to noise , and the distance to which such a merger can be observed increases by about 60% .",
    "the detection rate on earth therefore increases by about a factor of three .",
    "for 6 black holes , the detection rate decreases by a similar factor . for black - hole binaries with component masses",
    "@xmath59 , the first generation of detectors will be more sensitive to the merger itself than to the inspiral phase that precedes it ( flanagan & hughes 1998 ) .",
    "since the strongest signal is expected from black - hole binaries with high - mass components , it is critically important to improve our understanding of the merger waveform . even for lower - mass black holes",
    "( with @xmath60 ) , the inspiral signal comes from an epoch when the holes are so close together that the post - newtonian expansions used to calculate the wave forms are unreliable .",
    "the wave forms of this `` intermediate binary black hole regime '' ( brady et al .",
    "1998 ) are only now beginning to be explored .",
    "finally we stress that the black - hole binaries are highly eccentric , which affects their gravitational wave signals and also influences their detectability .",
