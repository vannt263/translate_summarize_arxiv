    "berger considered generation of magnons by spin - flipping of electrons , driven by the spin accumulation .",
    "slonczewski considered the electron spin component transverse to the magnetization , which is absorbed by the ferromagnet due to a combination of spin - dependent reflection at the interfaces and averaging of the electron spin precession phases in the ferromagnet .",

    "et al . _ ,  @xcite the effect of current was described as a nonequilibrium exchange interaction between f@xmath0 and f@xmath1 .",
    "this interaction was similar to an effective current - dependent field . later experimental results were found to be inconsistent with this effective field model .",
    "@xcite    the spin - torque model ( st ) has become dominant in the interpretation of experiments .",
    "@xcite a few exceptions include some of the point contact measurements , interpreted in terms of resonant electron - magnon scattering ,  @xcite and thermally activated switching , interpreted in terms of incoherent current - driven excitations , described as an effective magnetic temperature .",

    "@xcite    despite the overall success of st , several fundamental issues remain unresolved .",
    "first , approximation of the magnetization by a classical macrospin is essential for the coherent dynamics predicted by the model . on the other hand , finite - wavelength magnetic excitations ( magnons )",
    "are also found to be excited in certain extensions of st , thus violating the assumptions underlying the model .",
    "@xcite a large number of the excited magnetic modes then need to be considered to adequately describe the current - driven magnetic dynamics .",
    "this situation is fundamentally different from the magnetic excitation by ac field in transverse ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) experiments , where only uniform precession is excited by the ac magnetic field , because nonuniform excitations do not couple to this field . on a more fundamental level ,",
    "the relation of st to the quantum - mechanical picture involving electron - magnon scattering is not understood . among related issues ,",
    "energy transfer from the current to the magnetic system , and the magnetic dynamics induced by scattering of a single electron , are not addressed by the classical st .",
    "the first goal of this paper is to critically examine the fundamentals of st , and its relation to the quantum - mechanical electron - magnon scattering picture . in section  [ 2smodel ]",
    ", we consider a toy - model quantum analog of st , i.e. a model involving the quantum dynamics of both the nanopillar magnetization , treated as a macrospin , and current - carrying electrons .",
    "in addition to the st result for the coherent magnetic excitations , this model gives incoherent ( i.e. not described as a classical precession ) excitations . in the typical experiments , where the polarization of the current is initially e.g. antiparallel to the magnetization , the coherent excitation vanishes , while the incoherent excitation rate is largest .",
    "current - driven generation of finite - wavelength magnons , and magnon interactions further decrease the coherence of the excitation . in section  [ switching",

    "our model reproduces all of the experimental current - switching behaviors , and gives several predictions that distinguish it from st .",
    "in this section , we solve a simple model for the interaction of a conduction electron with a ferromagnet f@xmath1 , and show how the result relates both to st  @xcite and electron - magnon scattering framework .",

    "we define the exchange stiffness of a ferromagnet as the exchange contribution to the dispersion of the spin - waves in the bulk of the ferromagnet . in typical experiments ,",
    "the ratio of the exchange stiffness of f@xmath1 to its largest dimension is significantly smaller than the typical energies of conduction electrons scattered by this layer ( measured from the fermi level ) .",
    "thus , finite - wavelength magnetic modes are expected to be excited by the current , which can not be described in the fixed-@xmath3 ( macrospin ) approximation .",
    "when we relate our results to experiments in section  [ switching ] , the macrospin approximation is not used . in the present section ,",
    "we use the macrospin approximation both for comparison to st , which makes a similar approximation , and due to the transparency of the results .",

    "@xcite    @xmath43 characterizes the relaxation of the total magnetic energy , mostly due to scattering with the conduction electrons and phonons . in current - driven switching experiments , the magnetic energy relaxation into conduction electrons is partly blocked by the same mechanism that gives rise to the current - driven excitation .",
    "thus , @xmath43 is expected to be larger than in the fmr experiments with films of the same thickness as f@xmath1 .",
    "the magnetic energy relaxation is measured as a variation of @xmath45 , which we call the number of magnons .",
    "this definition needs to be expanded when including nonuniform magnetic excitations , which reduce the length of @xmath28 .",

    "@xcite in current - switching experiments , the nonlinear magnetic interactions are enhanced ( compared to the values for small amplitude fmr in bulk ferromagnets ) by high excitation levels associated with the switching ,  @xcite and by scattering at the surfaces of the thin layer f@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite    the relation @xmath47 allows for nonequilibrium populations of all the magnetic modes , even if only the uniform precession is excited by the current .",
    "moreover , we argue below that the current - driven excitations themselves ( regardless of the @xmath44 processes ) are at least partly incoherent , and many finite - wavelength modes are directly excited by the current .",

    "general arguments of statistical physics tell us that the nonlinear magnetic interactions tend to thermalize the magnetic excitations . in section  [ switching ] , the excited state is approximately described by an effective magnetic temperature @xmath48 .",

    "if one assumes that that the longitudinal spin - transfer is associated with coherent magnon generation , the corresponding initial angle @xmath42 of classical precession of @xmath28 around @xmath6 would follow from @xmath52 , giving @xmath53 .",
    "it is always larger than the estimate @xmath41 based on the transfer of the transverse spin ( see above ) .",
    "this means that scattering from a coherent state of @xmath28 ( e.g. @xmath54 ) to another ( tilted ) coherent state constitutes only a fraction of all the scattering processes .",

    "[ sf ] clarifies a popular misconception that the transverse electron spin component can be elastically ( without electron spin - flipping ) transferred to the magnetization . in this context , the probability of electron spin - flipping is identified with the longitudinal spin transfer . in the framework of the macrospin model , at large @xmath3",
    "the probability of electron spin - flip ( or equivalently magnon generation ) decreases as @xmath58 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath59 ( transverse at small excitation levels ) components of angular momentum , associated with excitation of uniform precession , are proportional to @xmath3 ( per magnon ) .",

    "when the conduction electron spends a sufficiently long time in f@xmath1 , @xmath65 , the outgoing electron will be any one of the @xmath66 electrons in the system , and will have spin projection @xmath63 with a large probability @xmath67 . the difference between this result and eq .",
    "[ sf ] is due to the excitation of magnons with finite wavelengths .",
    "this ( grossly oversimplified ) argument demonstrates again that all the magnetic modes are excited by the current , limited only by energy conservation .",

    "[ fig2](b ) shows the same calculation as in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , but without the spontaneous term .",
    "the main difference is the lack of a knee in the stability line at @xmath149 , evident in some published data .",
    "@xcite a knee at @xmath150 in some st - based calculations  @xcite is different , it is due to a singularity associated only with the @xmath151 limit .",
    "the knee in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) is due to the contribution of the spontaneous emission in eq .",

    "@xcite the switching fields decrease both at @xmath152 and @xmath150 , indicating that heating occurs instead of cooling .",
    "spontaneous magnon emission may also be responsible for some of the current - driven phenomena in single magnetic layers .",
    "@xcite as our ballistic analysis shows , the stimulated magnon emission vanishes in this case ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "we were able to model the published 295  k py / cu / py data with @xmath153 values similar to those used for co. fig .",

    ", @xmath131  mev@xmath128 , give good overall agreement with the experiment .",
    "the differences with the 295  k values reflect a decrease of the average energy of magnons excited by @xmath87 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath98,@xmath146 on @xmath117 does not appear in our model , and warrants a more detailed analysis of the temperature dependence of electron - magnon scattering .    beyond the switching diagrams , we identify the threshold @xmath155 for a large increase of @xmath122 in the state with parallel magnetizations of f@xmath0 , @xmath156 at @xmath152 ,  @xcite with the divergence of eq .",
    "[ effecttemp ] at @xmath157 . as we showed above , magnon generation saturates at large magnetic excitation amplitude , becoming nearly independent of @xmath122 .",
    ".  [ effecttemp ] is then replaced by a linear relation @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is a constant determined by the magnetic relaxation rate . a similar ( with a different constant term ) linear relation has been empirically proposed to explain the lack of temperature dependence of telegraph noise dwell times variations with current .",
    "@xcite in contrast , a formal relation @xmath160 expected for the st  @xcite does not fit those data .",
    "in section  [ 2smodel ] , we demonstrated that spin - polarized current flowing through a ferromagnet leads to both coherent and incoherent magnetic excitations ( not conserving the expectation value of the magnetic moment ) .",
    "only the coherent excitations are captured by the spin - torque model ( st ) . on the other hand",
    ", the electron - magnon scattering framework describes all the excitations , but does not give information about the level of excitation coherence .",
    "we argue that coherence of excitations may not be significant or important in typical current - switching experiments , due to direct generation of incoherent excitations by the current , and nonlinear magnetic interactions .    in section  [ switching ] , we describe an incoherent excitation of f@xmath1 in terms of a current - dependent magnetic temperature , and show that this approximation is consistent with the results of typical current - switching experiments . without the spontaneous magnon generation term , eq .",
    "[ effecttemp ] , describing the effect of current on the magnetization , is mathematically similar to the finite temperature result of st .",
    "the two models , however , are based on completely different underlying physical pictures . here",
    "we give two examples which distinguish these models .",
    "first , the spontaneous magnon generation term in eq .  [ effecttemp ] is absent in st .",
    "it gives : i ) excitations at small @xmath117 for layers with parallel static magnetizations , a nominal configuration in typical current - switching experiments ; ii ) current - driven excitations by unpolarized current ;  @xcite iii ) a knee in the magnetization stability curve at @xmath149 ,  @xcite related to stronger current - driven magnetic heating than the cooling achieved by reversal of the current .",
    "second , eq .  [ effecttemp ] suggests that the current - driven excitation rate may be enhanced by increasing the polarization  @xcite and electron - magnon scattering rates .",
    "larger excitation levels give smaller switching currents , needed for possible technological applications of direct current - driven switching in magnetic memory devices .",
    "higher scattering rates may be achieved by decreasing the effective magnetic volume excited by the current ( value of @xmath3 in eq .",
    "[ emission ] ) , through interface roughness , alloying , or building complex magnetic layers with a small exchange strength at the interfaces .",
    "the enhancement of electron - magnon scattering at rough interfaces , and in magnetically disordered alloys , can be understood not only in terms of the oversimplified model of section  [ 2smodel ] , but also from a more rigorous calculation of electron - magnon scattering amplitudes .",
    "@xcite in contrast , st gives reduced tranverse spin transfer for smaller magnetic volume ( @xmath161 in eq .",
    "[ sf ] ) , and independent of the interface roughness and magnetic disorder .",
