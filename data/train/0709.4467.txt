    "@xmath17 is finite .    however , there are many issues about problem ( [ maxut ] ) that are left untouched by the preceding theorem / scheme",
    ". to elaborate , in general there are the following progressive issues related to an optimization problem such as ( [ maxut ] ) :    * _ feasibility _ : whether there is at least one solution satisfying all the constraints involved . for ( [ maxut ] ) , since @xmath18 is a feasible solution , the feasibility is not an issue . * _ well - posedness _ : whether the supremum value of the problem with a non - empty feasible set is finite ( in which case the problem is called well - posed ) or @xmath19 ( ill - posed ) . an ill - posed problem is a mis - formulated one : the trade - off is not set right so one could always push the objective value to be arbitrarily high . * _ attainability _ : whether a well - posed problem admits an optimal solution .",

    "it is not an issue for ( [ maxut ] ) , since uniqueness holds automatically due to the strict concavity of the utility function .",
    "clearly , theorem [ generallag ] covers only the case when the problem is well - posed and the attainability holds , by assuming _ a priori _ that a lagrange multiplier exists ( indeed , in the context of portfolio selection the existing work always _ assumes _ that the lagrange multiplier exists ; see theorem 2.2.2 in page 7 of karatzas ( 1997 ) and page 65 of korn ( 1997)<+\\infty$ ] for any @xmath12 , which is equivalent to the existence of the lagrange multiplier for any @xmath2 ; see section 2 for details . ] ) .",

    "we will first show , through various counter - examples , that none of the aforementioned assumptions that have all along been taken for granted needs to hold true .",
    "then , we will address the following questions : when does the lagrange multiplier exist ?",
    "what if it does not ?",

    "section 3 studies the implications of the non - existence of the lagrange multiplier , and section 4 shows the possibility of ill - posedness even with the existence of the lagrange multiplier .",
