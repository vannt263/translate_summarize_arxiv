    "the energy composition in the jet / outflow of astrophysical systems is an important and fundamental question , since it leads to significant differences for the subsequent energy dissipation process , particle acceleration mechanism , radiation spectrum and light curve , polarization behavior , neutrino emission luminosity , and so on . generally speaking",
    ", jets can be separated into two types depending on their energy composition : poynting - flux - dominated ( pfd ) ( @xmath1 ) and matter - flux - dominated ( mfd ) ( @xmath2 ) , where @xmath0 is the magnetization parameter defined as the ratio between the electromagnetic field ( emf ) energy flux to the plasma matter energy flux .",
    "many independent observations from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , micro - quasars , and crab nebula give strong hints of the pfd outflows at least for some events .",
    "several theoretical models have been proposed within the framework of pfd jets / outflows to interpret the observations",
    ".    in the field of grbs , evidence of pfd jets has been collected independently in several directions .",
    "first , a prominent thermal emission component as expected in the fireball - internal - shock model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been seen only in a small fraction of grbs ( e.g. grb 090902b , @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of grbs either show no evidence of a thermal component or a weak , sub - dominant thermal component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these grbs require that the grb central engine is highly magnetized , and jet is still pfd at the emission site @xcite .",
    "next , strong linear polarization was discovered during the prompt gamma - ray emission phase for some grbs @xcite , and during the reverse - shock - dominated early optical afterglow emission phase for some others @xcite , which hint at the existence of globally ordered magnetic fields in the jet .",
    "furthermore , strong pev neutrino emission as predicted by the mfd models has not been observed from grbs so far @xcite , which is consistent with the expectation of the pfd models @xcite .",
    "finally , the mfd internal shock ( is ) model for grbs also suffers some criticisms , such as low energy dissipation efficiency @xcite , electron fast cooling @xcite , the electron number excess @xcite , and inconsistency with some empirical ( amati / yonetoku ) relations @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a novel pfd outflow model named as  the internal - collision - induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence ( icmart ) \" , which can potentially keep the merits of the is model but alleviate the criticisms faced by the is model mentioned above .",
    "the main idea of the icmart model is that the grb jets are poynting - flux dominated .",
    "the poynting flux is catastrophically discharged at a relatively large distance ( e.g. @xmath3 cm ) from the central engine through collision - induced magnetic reconnection .",
    "the magnetic energy is converted to particle energy and radiation efficiently , leading to a very high radiation efficiency as demanded by the grb data @xcite .",
    "a pfd jet has less leptons than the mfd model so that the electron excess problem is avoided .",
    "a large emission radius favors a moderately fast cooling , which can account for the right low - energy spectral index observed in grbs @xcite .",
    "it also gives a natural explanation of the seconds - duration of `` slow variability component''observed in grbs @xcite .",
    "the rapid `` fast variability component '' can be interpreted within this scenario as mini - jets due to locally lorentz boosted regions ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is speculated that turbulent reconnection in a moderately high-@xmath0 flow can give rise to relativistic motion of mini - jets within the bulk relativistic motion of the jets .    for agns , observations show fast variable tev flares of two blazars ( mrk 501 and pks 2155 - 304 ) @xcite .",
    "the light - crossing time is even shorter than the event horizon size of the black holes , so that emission must come from a small local region .",
    "the derived lorentz factor in the emission region should be larger than 50 @xcite .",
    "this value is much larger than the observed lorentz factor of the bulk motion of the global jet , which is generally smaller than 10 @xcite . to interpret these observations , @xcite proposed a  jets in a jet \" model , which considers that some mini - jets are generated by local reconnection outflows in a global pfd jet",
    ". the mini - jets can give extra lorentz boosting and particle acceleration to generate the observed tev photons around these local reconnection regions with fast variability . even though @xcite did not specify the mechanism of magnetic dissipation ,",
    "observations of agn jets reveal bright knots that are consistent with internal interactions within the jet . within the pdf jet scenario ,",
    "icmart processes similar to what are envisaged in grb jets may also play a role .",
    "another related astrophysical phenomenon is @xmath4-ray flares observed from the crab nebula .",
    "monte carlo simulations suggest that the bright @xmath4-ray flares and fluctuations in longer time scales can be understood within the framework that there are many mini - jets with a wide distribution of size and lorentz factor within the pfd outflow of the pulsar .",
    "the flares correspond to the epochs when some bright mini - jets beaming towards earth @xcite .",
    "the observations suggest that similar physical processes as those operating in grbs and agns may be playing a role in the crab nebula .    in another front ,",
    "recent partical - in - cell ( pic ) simulations @xcite show that reconnection under high-@xmath0 condition can efficiently accelerate thermal particles to form a non - thermal power - law population of the particles .",
    "this gives a good support to the above pfd models from the particle acceleration point of view .",
    "the models discussed above for different astrophysical systems share some common physical processes , such as efficient magnetic energy dissipation in the pfd outflow / jet , mini - jets generated by the relativistic outflows due to local reconnections , particle acceleration in the reconnection region , and production of the non - thermal emission . although these models show great potential to interpret the observations and overcome the criticisms in the traditional mfd models , some important ingradients of the models are still of a speculative nature .",
    "detailed numerical simulations are needed to give a solid footing to these models .    from the morphologic point of view",
    ", jets / outflows can be categorized into two types : continuous and episodic .",
    "theoretically , episodic jets can be formed either from a highly variable central engine with variable accretion rate ; or disruption of a continuous jet by screw or kink instabilities @xcite ; or from a mhd erruption process similar to solar coronal mass ejection @xcite .",
    "observationally , episodic jets or knots in jets have been observed in many x - ray binaries @xcite and agns @xcite .",
    "rapid variabilities observed in grbs also point towards highly episodic jets @xcite . as a result ,",
    "studying interactions or collisions between magnetic blobs or shells is of great interest .    in this paper , we perform detailed numerical simulations on the global properties of collisions between high-@xmath0 blobs , as envisaged in the icmart model of grbs @xcite . in section ",
    "[ sec : setup ] , we give a brief introduction of our 3d relativistic mhd code and the simulation setup . in section  [ sec : example ] , we present an example simulation case to show the key results , and perform a detailed analysis and resolution study .",
    "we then expand our simulations on two - blob collisions in section ",
    "[ sec : para ] to a large parameter space and discuss how different parameters affect the simulations results . in section  [ sec:4blobs ]",
    ", we show preliminary results for multiple collisions among four high-@xmath0 blobs .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : summary ] and discuss the implications of our simulation results on some high energy astrophysical systems , such as grbs and agns .",
    "we use a 3d special relativistic mhd ( srmhd ) code which solves the conservative form of the ideal mhd equations using higher - order godunov - type finite - volume methods .",
    "this code is a development version of the  la - compass \" mhd code which was first developed by @xcite at los alamos national laboratory .",
    "the equations solved in the code are : @xmath5 = 0 , \\\\ & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\gamma^2 h - p-\\gamma \\rho c^2 + \\frac{b^2+e^2}{8 \\pi } ) + \\nabla \\cdot[(\\gamma^2 h-\\gamma \\rho c^2){\\mbox{\\boldmath $ v$ } } \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\frac{c}{4 \\pi}{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ e$}}\\times { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}]=0,\\\\ & \\frac{\\partial { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}}{\\partial t}+ c \\nabla \\times { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ e$}}=0,\\\\ & { \\mbox{\\boldmath",

    "we also use the ideal gas equation of state : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the adiabatic index and the internal energy density , respectively .",
    "we use hll flux with the piecewise parabolic reconstruction method to solve the riemann problem @xcite , and use the constrained transport ( ct ) method @xcite to ensure @xmath17 .",
    "we use the cartesian coordinates @xmath18 in our simulations .",
    "we envisage that the central engine of grbs or agns launch a poynting - flux - dominated jet / outflow . as discussed in sect .",
    "1 , episodic jets are preferred from observational data .",
    "even if the jet may be overall continuous , it is very likely non - uniform internally and may form many knots in the jet , where a much larger amount of emf energy ( @xmath19 ) is concentrated compared with other sparse regions in the jet .",
    "we can simplify the knots of the jet / outflow as many quasi - isolated magnetic blobs with both poloidal and toroidal field components . due to the intrinsic erratic behavior at the central engine",
    ", different magnetic blobs may have different velocities at the emission region , so that multiple collisions are very likely to happen among different blobs .",
    "due to the ultra relativistic motion of the jet , the relative velocities between different blobs can easily become relativistic .    in our simulation domain",
    ", we use the model from @xcite to initialize the magnetic field configuration .",
    "the equations are introduced in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath20 , and we will transfer them to the cartesian coordinates @xmath18 in our simulations .",
    "from the center ( @xmath21 ) of each blobs , the field is assumed to be axisymmetric with the poloidal flux function @xmath22 as @xmath23 and the relationship between @xmath24 and the @xmath25 component of the vector potential @xmath26 is @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 are the normalization factor for the magnetic strength and characteristic radius of the magnetic blob , respectively .",
    "one can then calculate the @xmath30 and @xmath31 components of the poloidal field @xmath32 and @xmath33    the poloidal field is closed and keeps the net global poloidal flux as zero .",
    "the toroidal field configuration is motivated by considering the black hole accretion disk system as a  dynamo \" , which shears the poloidal flux to form the toroidal flux from the rotation .",
    "the toroidal component of the magnetic field therefore has the form @xmath34 here the parameter @xmath35 controls the toroidal - to - poloidal flux ratio .",
    "@xcite showed that when @xmath36 , the two flux components are roughly equal with each other .",
    "we set @xmath37 for our example simulation , and explore a larger value of @xmath35 in section ",
    "[ subsec : alpha ] .",
    "we choose the comoving center - of - mass frame of the blobs as our simulation frame .",
    "the direction of velocity is along @xmath38-axis with a profile @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a constant value which can be either positive or negative corresponding to @xmath41 or @xmath42 direction of the velocity .",
    "we also set a uniform gas pressure value ( @xmath9 ) both inside and outside the blobs .",
    "the value of @xmath9 is much smaller than the initial magnetic energy density of the blobs .    for the density profile ,",
    "we first define a constant initial value of the blob magnetization parameter around the central region of the blobs : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the specific enthalpy defined in the fluid s comoving frame , @xmath7 is the rest mass density , @xmath9 is the gas pressure introduced above , @xmath15 is the adiabatic index , @xmath6 is the bulk lorentz factor calculated by the velocity profile introduced above , and @xmath19 is the emf energy density calculated by @xmath45 from the magnetic field profile introduced above .",
    "the density profile is therefore @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant parameter to control the uniform background mass density .",
    "we also introduce two position - control parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for a collision between two blobs , the center of the two blobs",
    "are located at @xmath50 and @xmath51 , so @xmath52 is the initial distance between the center of the two blobs in @xmath38 direction , and @xmath53 is the initial misalignment between the center of the two blobs in @xmath54 direction due to the possible misalignment of the blobs .",
    "the @xmath55 coordinate is the same for both of them .    in table",
    "[ tab : t2 ] , we give the normalization relationship between the code units and the physical units .",
    "there are only three free parameters , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 to control the normalization of the entire system . defining different physical values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 ,",
    "we can normalize the simulation system to different environments and problems . in table [ tab : t2 ] , we also list two sets of example typical values to show the way of the normalization . in the rest of paper , all the parameters are given using code units .",
    "we keep @xmath59 for all the following simulations .",
    "in addition , we use @xmath60 in most of the simulations , since most of the regimes are mildly relativistic .",
    "this may not always be true , especially in the regions of reconnection outflows , so in section ",

    "in this paper , using a 3d srmhd code , we carried out a series of simulations to study collisions between high-@xmath0 magnetic blobs . through a detailed example simulation and an extended parameter space survey ,",
    "we have reached the following robust results :    * collisions trigger significant emf energy dissipation .",
    "detailed analyses of the numerical data during different stages of the collision process suggest that such dissipation is facilitated by collision - induced magnetic reconnection .",
    "the efficiency of @xmath19 dissipation in our simulations is around 35% , which is insensitive to the numerical resolution and several initial condition parameters , such as @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath48 , @xmath9 , and @xmath47 .",
    "it depends on the impact parameter @xmath49 , which defines the area of the anti - parallel regions in the contact surface of the two blobs . as long as a small offset exists",
    ", significant dissipation is facilitated .",
    "* our simulations suggest that the collision process is essentially inelastic . even though there is some kind of bouncing back in the early stage of the collision evelution , the strong reconnection effect in the contact surface",
    "efficiently dissipates the magnetic energy and reduces the magnetic pressure . as a result",
    ", the two high-@xmath0 blobs merge into one larger blob with a ",
    "@xmath64\"-shaped magnetic configuration ( see more details in section  [ subsec : physical ] ) . assuming complete inelastic collision , an estimated dissipation efficiency @xcite is found consistent with the efficiency derived from the numerical data . * from our simulations",
    ", we find that magnetic reconnection events can induce relativistic , multi - orientation outflows . even in two - blob simulations ,",
    "as long as an offset exists ( @xmath65 ) , 3d outflows are formed . for four - blob collisions ,",
    "significant outflows exist in three distinct regions .",
    "these outflows would mimic `` mini - jets '' as invoked in the astrophysical models of grbs and agns .",
    "the maximum outflow velocity ( @xmath66 ) in our simulations is only @xmath67 .",
    "however , due to the significant resolution - dependence behavior as described in section ",
    "[ subsec : res ] , we still have not reached the convergence for the outflow velocity , so that that value is only the lower limit of @xmath66 . in the simulations",
    ", we found that @xmath68 can reach and even exceed local @xmath69 and @xmath70 (  [ subsec : v_out ] ) , both are relativistic numbers if @xmath71 .",
    "also a larger @xmath63 tends to give a larger @xmath66 value . in principle , with a high - resolution simulation and for a large @xmath62 and @xmath63 , an even larger mini - jet lorentz factor is achievable .",
    "* we found an interesting linear relationship between the initial ( @xmath62 ) and the finial ( @xmath72 ) values of the @xmath0 parameter of the blob ( eq.([equ : sigmas ] ) ) .",
    "the range of @xmath62 we have explored is not very large due to the code capability constraint .",
    "it is valuable to study this intriguing behavior in a larger range of @xmath62 in the future . *",
    "our preliminary simulations of multiple collisions among multiple high-@xmath0 blobs suggest that the collisions would give rise to more complex configurations of the reconnection layers and multi - orientation outflows , with a higher emf energy dissipation efficiency .",
    "this suggests that the multiple collisions of many high-@xmath0 blobs can potentially generate many mini - jets with relatively random directions , as required by some theoretical models of astrophysical jets .",
    "these numerical simulations have profound implications to understand astrophysical jets , such as grbs , agns , x - ray binaries , crab nebula , and so on . in the following ,",
    "we discuss their direct applications to grb and agn models .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction section , @xcite proposed the icmart model to interpret the prompt emission of grbs .",
    "this model invokes collision - induced magnetic dissipation of moderately high-@xmath0 blobs , which is the motivation of our simulations .",
    "the icmart model was suggested to have several salient features that can potentially interpret various observations not easy to interpret within the mdf internal shock models .",
    "our simulations verified several assumptions / speculations adopted in the original model of @xcite .",
    "first , @xcite claimed that icmart processes should have a significantly higher energy dissipation efficiency than internal shocks , which is more consistent with the grb observations @xcite .",
    "they assumed that once icmart is triggered , the two colliding shells would merge completely in an inelastic collision .",
    "the @xmath0 values of the two shells / blobs drop significantly from an initial value to a much lower final value .",
    "energy and momemtum conservations suggest that the energy dissipation efficiency is high , up to 10s of percent , depending on the final @xmath0 value of the merged blob . if @xmath73 , they found that the efficiency is close to 50% .",
    "our detailed simulations verified all these assumptions / speculations .",
    "indeed significant magnetic dissipation occurs due to collision - induced magnetic reconnection .",
    "the collision process is essentially inelastic , and the energy dissipation efficiency is indeed high , which is @xmath74 in for two - blob collisions and @xmath75 for four - blob collisions .",
    "one surprising result is that the final value @xmath72 is linearly correlated with the intial value @xmath62 ( eq.([equ : sigmas ] ) ) , so that the efficiency does not sensitively depend on @xmath72 .",
    "more studies are needed to reveal the underlying physics of this correlation .",
    "second , the icmart model invokes the central engine activities to interpret the broad pulses in the grb light curves , but requires the existence of mini - jets to account for the rapid variability component .",
    "@xcite used this concept to perform a series of monte carlo simulations and reproduced a range of highly variable light curves with both slow and fast components as seen in observational data @xcite .",
    "the required lorentz factor of the mini - jets is in the range of 2 - 15 @xcite . in our simulations , the outflows of reconnection layers",
    "can reach mildly relativistic speed .",
    "from the orientation point of view , one major reconnection current layer between two colliding blobs already generates multi - orientation outflows ( see figure [ fig : stages ] ) , in addition to systematical global rotation and twist due to the slightly initial misalignment .",
    "furthermore , by invoking four - blob collisions , we clearly find three major reconnection layers with different directions .",
    "each of them has their own 3d outflow systems similar to two - blob collision cases , which gives a more complex space - time distribution of the outflow directions . in realistic systems , collisions of tens of blobs",
    "would lead to more complicated 3d mini - jet structure , which would account for observed grb light curves .",
    "it is possible in much smaller scales not resolved by the current simulations , perturbations may induce turbulent reconnections , which may make even smaller mini - jets in the current outflows .",
    "dedicated local simulations are needed to verify or refute such a speculation . with the current global simulations ,",
    "one is confident that even without turbulence , collision - induced reconnection layers can already generate large - scale mini - jets in the bulk jet of a grb , which would give interesting variability features in the light curves .",
    "finally , our simulations show significant evolution of the magnetic field configuration during one icmart event . from figure",
    "[ fig : field ] , we can see that during the early collision - driven reconnection phase ( e.g. the  plateau \" phase ) , the strengths of @xmath76 and @xmath77 components decrease and the @xmath78 component increases , which significantly changes the magnetic field configuration while still keeping a relative ordered magnetic configuration in a relatively short time duration .",
    "the behavior may potentially interpret the significant change of the polarization angle during the prompt emission phase observed in grb 100826a @xcite .",
    "some blazars show very fast tev flares whose durations are only several minutes @xcite .",
    "this duration is much shorter than the light crossing time for the entire system , which means that emission comes from a small local region .",
    "the requirement of emitting tev photons also demand a much larger lorentz factor in the emission region ( greater than 50 , @xcite ) than what is inferred for the bulk motion ( typically smaller than 10 , @xcite ) .",
    "a successful model to interpret the observations is the `` jets in a jet '' model proposed by @xcite .",
    "this model invokes current - instability triggered local magnetic reconnections in a global , poynting - flux - dominated jet .",
    "these local reconnections generate local outflows or mini - jets with a comoving lorentz factor around a few .",
    "our simulations give an alternative process to trigger the local reconnections by considering icmart events , i.e. collisions among magnetic knots / blobs inside the global jet .",
    "since the knots in agns have already been observed @xcite , the collisions would very likely happen , which trigger the local reconnections and generate the mini - jets as needed in their model .",
    "we can also roughly estimate the time scale using our simulation results and the parameters in the model of @xcite .",
    "they estimated that the typical size of the blob in the rest frame of the blob is around @xmath79 .",
    "since the lorentz factor of the blob in the comoving frame of the global jet is equal to 10 ( assuming @xmath80 ) , the size of the global jet in the comoving frame is about @xmath81 , which can be treated as @xmath56 in our table [ tab : t2 ] .",
    "thus one time unit in our simulations can be normalized as @xmath82 .",
    "the duration of the reconnection - facilitated energy dissipation is about 50 time units in our example case ( see figure [ fig : f1 ] from t=30 to t=80 ) , which can be translated to about @xmath83 in the rest frame of the global jet .",
    "the duration in the observer frame is @xmath84 , which is very close to the observed durations of the flares .",
    "this work is supported by the lanl / ldrd program and institutional computing programs at lanl and by doe / office of fusion energy science through cmso , and by nasa through grant nnx14af85 g funded to unlv .",
