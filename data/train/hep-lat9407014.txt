    "this seems to indicate a ` planckian regime ' where classical behavior breaks down .",
    "one of the interesting observables in the model is the dimension at large scales . a common way to define a fractal dimension",
    "is by studying the behaviour of the volume within a distance @xmath1 and identifying the dimension @xmath6 if the volume behaves like @xmath103 such a measurement has been done in @xcite , using the geodesic distance and a distance defined in terms of the massive scalar propagator @xcite .",

    "it appears to behave like a branched polymer , which has an intrinsic fractal dimension of 2 @xcite .",
    "moving away from the transition , the curvature changes much more rapidly than in the small @xmath3 phase and the effective curvature radius @xmath179 soon becomes of the order of the lattice distance . a priori , two outcomes seem plausible . in the first ,",
    "the system collapses and @xmath179 becomes of order 1 in lattice units , reflecting the unboundedness of the continuum action from below . in the second , the spacetime remains 4-dimensional and @xmath179 can still be tuned to large values in lattice units , but very small compared to the global size @xmath127 , for a sufficiently large system .",
    "so far the second outcome seems to be favored , for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the function @xmath0 looks convex for @xmath180 slightly above the transition , e.g.  for @xmath181 at 16000 simplices . in other words , the linear behavior as seen in figure  [ fitelo ]",
    "does not set in immediately above the transition .",
    "secondly , the system shows scaling and the scaling dimension @xmath8 as defined in ( [ scal4 ] ) is approximately 4 even far into the elongated phase , indicating 4-dimensional behavior at small scales .",
    "high and low dimensions in the crumpled and elongated phases with the value four at the transition were reported earlier in ref .",
    "this dimension was apparently interpreted as a small scale dimension , whereas instead we find a small scale dimension of four in all phases .",
    "similar results are also found in the regge calculus approach to quantum gravity @xcite , where one also finds two phases , a strong ( bare newton ) coupling phase with negative curvature and fractal dimension four , and ( using an @xmath182 term in the action for stabilization ) a weak coupling phase with fractal dimension around two .",
    "the evidence for scaling indicates continuum behavior .",
    "this brings up a number of issues which need to be addressed in a physical interpetation of the model .",
    "one guideline in this work is the question whether there is a regime of distances where @xmath183 behaves classically for suitable bare newton constant @xmath38 .",
    "the connection with classical spacetime can be strengthened by identifying the geodesic distance @xmath1 with a cosmic time @xmath184 and @xmath185 with the scale factor @xmath186 in a euclidean robertson - walker metric .",
    "the classical action for @xmath187 is given by",
    "@xmath188 +    \\lambda\\left(2\\pi^2\\int dr\\ , a^3 -v\\right ) , \\label{msp}\\ ] ] where @xmath189 is a lagrange multiplier enforcing a total spacetime volume @xmath190 .",
    "it plays the role of a cosmological constant which is just right for getting volume @xmath190 . for positive",
    "@xmath191 the solution of the equations of motion following from ( [ msp ] ) is @xmath192 , which represents @xmath10 with @xmath193 . for negative @xmath191",
    "the solution is @xmath194 which represents a space of constant negative curvature @xmath195 , cut off at a maximal radius to get total volume @xmath190 .    the form ( [ msp ] ) serves as a crude effective action for the system for intermediate distances around the maximum in @xmath64 at @xmath127 , and couplings @xmath196 in the transition region . at larger distances the fluctuations of the spacetimes",
    "grow , causing large baby universes and branching , and averaging over these may be the reason for the asymmetric shape of @xmath64 . because of this the robertson - walker metric can not give a good description at these distances .",
    "intuitively one expects also strong deviations of classical behavior at distances of order of the planck length @xmath197 , assuming that a planck length exists in the model .",
    "a proposal for measuring it was put forward in @xcite .",
    "the steep rise in the running curvature @xmath5 at smaller @xmath1 indeed suggests such a planckian regime .",
    "it extends to rather large @xmath1 but it appears to shrink compared to @xmath127 as the lattice distance decreases , i.e. @xmath48 increases for a given scaling curve labelled by @xmath135 .",
    "this suggests that the planck length goes to zero with the lattice spacing , @xmath198 as @xmath199 at fixed @xmath135 .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the planck is length of order of the lattice spacing , although this is of course quite possible .",
    "however , the theory may also scale at planckian distances and belong to a universality class .",
    "it might then be ` trivial ' .    at this point",
    "it is instructive to recall other notorious models with a dimensionful coupling as in einstein gravity , the 4d nonlinear sigma models .",
    "the lattice models have been well studied , in particular the @xmath200 model for low energy pion physics ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it has one free parameter @xmath201 which corresponds to the renormalized dimensionful coupling @xmath202 ; @xmath203 is the pion decay constant or the electroweak scale in the application to the standard model . with this one bare parameter",
    "it is possible to tune _ two _ quantities , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is the mass of the sigma particle or the higgs particle .",
    "this trick is possible because the precise value of @xmath11 is unimportant , as long as it is sufficiently small gev and for a higgs mass @xmath207 gev or less , @xmath11 is 15 orders of magnitude smaller than the planck length , or even much smaller . ] .",
    "however , in the continuum limit @xmath208 triviality takes its toll : @xmath209 and the model becomes noninteracting . the analogy @xmath210",
    ", @xmath211 suggests that we may be lucky and there is a scaling region in @xmath3@xmath48 space , for a given scaling curve ( given @xmath135 ) , where the theory has universal properties and where we can tune @xmath212 to a whole range of desired values . taking the scaling _",
    "however might lead to a trivial theory with @xmath213 . in case",
    "this scenario fails it is of course possible to introduce more parameters , e.g.  as in @xmath182 gravity , to get more freedom in the value of @xmath212 .",
    "this then raises the question of universality at the planck scale .",
    "we really would like to replace @xmath214 by @xmath2 in the reasoning in the previous paragraph , since we view @xmath2 as the local classical curvature , provided that a classical regime indeed develops as @xmath215 .",
    "next we discuss the nature of the elongated phase .",
    "even deep in this phase we found evidence for scaling .",
    "furthermore , for given scaling curve , increasing @xmath48 means decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "hence , increasing @xmath48 at fixed @xmath3 brings the system deeper in the elongated phase .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that there is nothing wrong with the elongated phase .",
    "it decribes very large spacetimes which are two dimensional on the scale of @xmath127 but not necessarily at much smaller scales .",
    "it could be effectively classical at scales much larger than the planck length but much smaller than @xmath127 .",
    "this reasoning further suggests that @xmath48 and @xmath3 primarily serve to specify the ` shape ' of the spacetime .",
    "the tuning @xmath216 is apparently not needed for obtaining criticality but for obtaining a type of spacetime .",
    "the peak in the susceptibility of the regge curvature could be very much a reflection of shape dependence .",
    "most importantly , this suggests that the physical properties associated with general coordinate invariance will be recovered automatically in 4d dynamical triangulation , as in 2d with fixed topology lattice gauge theory , which for @xmath217 has been found to posses a coulomb phase , a whole region in bare parameter space with massless photons ; see for example ref .",
