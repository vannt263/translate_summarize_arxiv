    "a heterogeneous material ( medium ) is one that composed of domains of different materials or phases ( e.g. , a composite ) or the same material in different states ( e.g. , a polycrystal ) .",
    "such materials are ubiquitous ; examples include sandstones , granular media , animal and plant tissue , gels , foams and concrete .",
    "the microstructures of heterogeneous materials can be only characterized statistically via various types of @xmath1-point correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the effective transport , mechanical , and electromagnetic properties of heterogeneous materials are known to be dependent on an infinite set of correlation functions that statistically characterize the microstructure @xcite .",
    "_ reconstruction _ of heterogeneous materials from a knowledge of limited microstructural information ( a set of lower - order correlation functions ) is an intriguing inverse problem @xcite .",
    "an effective reconstruction procedure enables one to generate accurate structures and subsequent analysis can be performed on the image to obtain macroscopic properties of the materials ; see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this provides a nondestructive means of estimating the macroscopic properties : a problem of important technological relevance .",
    "another useful application is reconstruction of a three - dimensional structure of the heterogeneous material using information extracted from two - dimensional plane cuts through the material @xcite .",
    "such reconstructions are of great value in a wide variety of fields , including petroleum engineering , biology and medicine , because in many cases one only has two - dimensional information such as a micrograph or image . generating realizations of heterogeneous materials from a set of hypothetical correlation functions is often referred to as a _ construction _ problem .",
    "a successful means of construction enables one to identify and categorize materials based on their correlation functions .",
    "one can also determine how much information is contained in the correlation functions and test realizability of various types of hypothetical correlation functions .",
    "furthermore , an effective ( re)construction procedure can be employed to investigate any physical phenomena where the understanding of spatiotemporal patterns is fundamental , such as in turbulence @xcite .    a popular ( re)construction procedure is based on the use of gaussian random fields : successively passing a normalized uncorrelated random gaussian field through a linear and then a nonlinear filter to yield the discrete values representing the phases of the structure .",
    "the mathematical background used in the statistical topography of gaussian random fields was originally established in the work of rice @xcite .",
    "many variations of this method have been developed and applied since then @xcite .",
    "the gaussian - field approach assumes that the spatial statistics of a two - phase random medium can be completely described by specifying only the volume fraction and standard two - point correlation function @xmath0 , which gives the probability of finding two points separated by vector distance @xmath2 in one of the phases @xcite .",
    "however , to reproduce gaussian statistics it is not enough to impose conditions on the first two cumulants only , but also to simultaneously ensure that higher - order cumulants vanish @xcite .",
    "in addition , the method is not suitable for extension to non - gaussian statistics , and hence is model dependent .",
    "recently , torquato and coworkers have introduced another stochastic ( re)construction technique @xcite . in this method ,",
    "one starts with a given , arbitrarily chosen , initial configuration of random medium and a set of target functions .",
    "the medium can be a dispersion of particle - like building blocks @xcite or , more generally , a digitized image @xcite .",
    "the target functions describe the desirable statistical properties of the medium of interest , which can be various correlation functions taken either from experiments or theoretical considerations .",
    "the method proceeds to find a realization ( configuration ) in which calculated correlation functions best match the target functions .",
    "this is achieved by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the calculated and target functions via stochastic optimization techniques , such as the simulated annealing method @xcite .",
    "this method is applicable to multidimensional and multiphase media , and is highly flexible to include any type and number of correlation functions as microstructural information . it is both a generalization and simplification of the aforementioned gaussian - field ( re)construction technique .",
    "moreover , it does not depend on any particular statistics @xcite .",
    "there are many different types of statistical descriptors that can be chosen as target functions @xcite ; the most basic one is the aforementioned two - point correlation function @xmath0 , which is obtainable from small - angle x - ray scattering @xcite .",
    "however , not every hypothetical two - point correlation function corresponds to a realizable two - phase medium @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of great fundamental and practical importance to determine the necessary conditions that realizable two - point correlation functions must possess @xcite .",
    "shepp showed that convex combinations and products of two scaled autocovariance functions of one - dimensional media ( equivalent to two - point correlation functions ; see definition below ) satisfy all known necessary conditions for a realizable scaled autocovariance function @xcite .",
    "more generally , we will see that a hypothetical function obtained by a particular combination of a set of realizable scaled autocovariance functions corresponding to @xmath3-dimensional media is also realizable .    in this paper , we generalize shepp s work and argue that given a complete two - point correlation function space , @xmath0 of any statistically homogeneous material",
    "can be expressed through a map on a selected set of bases of the function space .",
    "we collect all known necessary conditions of realizable two - point correlation functions and formulate a new conjecture .",
    "we also provide new examples of realizable two - point correlation functions and suggest a set of analytical basis functions .",
    "we further discuss an exact mathematical formulation of the ( re)construction problem and show that @xmath0 can not completely specify a two - phase heterogeneous material alone , apart from the issue of chirality .",
    "moreover , we devise an efficient and isotropy - preserving construction algorithm to generate realizations of materials from their two - point correlation functions . subsequent analysis can be performed on the generated images to estimate desired macroscopic properties that depend on @xmath0 , including both linear @xcite and nonlinear @xcite behavior .",
    "these developments are integrated here into a general scheme that enables one to model and categorize heterogeneous materials via two - point correlation functions .",
    "although the general scheme is applicable in any space dimension , we will mainly focus on two - dimensional media here . in the second part of this series of two papers @xcite , we will provide algorithmic details and applications of our general scheme .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the basic quantities used in the description of two - phase random media . in sec .",
    "iii , we gather all the known necessary conditions for realizable two - point correlation functions and make a conjecture on a new possible necessary condition based on simulation results . in sec .",
    "iv , we propose a general form through which the scaled autocovariance functions can be expressed by a set of chosen basis functions and discuss the choice of basis functions . in sec .",
    "v , we formulate the ( re)construction problem using rigorous mathematics and show that @xmath0 alone can not completely specify a two - phase random medium .",
    "thus , it is natural to solve the problem by stochastic optimization method ( i.e. , simulated annealing ) .",
    "the optimization procedure and the lattice - point algorithm are also discussed . in sec .",
    "vi , we provide several illustrative examples . in sec .",
    "vii , we make concluding remarks .",
    "the ensuing discussion leading to the definitions of the @xmath1-point correlation functions follows closely the one given by torquato @xcite .",
    "consider a realization of a two - phase random heterogeneous material within @xmath3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath4 . to characterize this binary system ,",
    "in which each phase has volume fraction @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , it is customary to introduce the indicator function @xmath7 defined as    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the region occupied by phase @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the region occupied by the other phase .",
    "the statistical characterization of the spatial variations of the binary system involves the calculation of @xmath1-point correlation functions :    @xmath12    where the angular brackets @xmath13 denote ensemble averaging over independent realizations of the random medium .    for _ statistically homogeneous _ media ,",
    "the @xmath1-point correlation function depends not on the absolute positions but on their relative displacements , i.e. ,    @xmath14    for all @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "thus , there is no preferred origin in the system , which in eq .",
    "( [ eq1002 ] ) we have chosen to be the point @xmath17 . in particular , the one - point correlation function is a constant everywhere , namely , the volume fraction @xmath5 of phase @xmath10 , i.e. ,    @xmath18    and it is the probability that a randomly chosen point in the medium belongs to phase @xmath10 . for",
    "_ statistically isotropic _ media , the @xmath1-point correlation function is invariant under rigid - body rotation of the spatial coordinates . for @xmath19 ,",
    "this implies that @xmath20 depends only on the distances @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) . for @xmath23 , it is generally necessary to retain vector variables because of chirality of the medium .",
    "the two - point correlation function @xmath24 defined as    @xmath25    is one of the most important statistical descriptors of random media .",
    "it also can be interpreted as the probability that two randomly chosen points @xmath17 and @xmath26 both lie in phase @xmath10 . for _ statistical homogeneous _ and _ isotropic _ media , @xmath27 only depends on scalar distances , i.e. ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 .",
    "global information about the surface of the @xmath10th phase may be obtained by ensemble averaging the gradient of @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath30 is different from zero only on the interfaces of the @xmath10th phase , the corresponding specific surface @xmath31 defined as the total area of the interfaces divided by the volume of the medium is given by @xcite    @xmath32    note that there are other higher - order surface correlation functions which are discussed in detail by torquato @xcite .",
    "the calculation of higher - order correlation functions encounters both analytical and numerical difficulties , and very few experimental results needed for comparison purposes are available so far . however , their importance in the description of collective phenomena is indisputable .",
    "a possible pragmatic approach is to study more complex lower - order correlation functions ; for instance , the two - point cluster function @xmath33 defined as the probability that two randomly chosen points @xmath17 and @xmath26 belong to the same cluster of phase @xmath10 @xcite ; or the lineal - path function @xmath34 defined as the probability that the entire line segment between points @xmath17 and @xmath26 lies in phase @xmath10 @xcite . @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the reconstructed media",
    "are sometimes computed to study the non - uniqueness issue of the reconstruction @xcite .",
    "the task of determining the necessary and sufficient conditions that @xmath35 must possess is very complex . in the context of stochastic processes in time ( one - dimensional processes )",
    ", it has been shown that the autocovariance functions must not only meet all the necessary conditions we will present in this section but another condition on `` corner - positive '' matrices @xcite . since little is known about corner - positive matrices , this theorem is very difficult to apply in practice .",
    "thus , when determining whether a hypothetical function is realizable or not , we will first check all the necessary conditions collected here and then use the construction technique to generate realizations of the random medium associated with the hypothetical function as further verification .      here",
    "we collect all of the known necessary conditions on @xmath36 @xcite . for a two - phase statistically homogeneous medium , the two - point correlation function for phase 2",
    "is simply related to the corresponding function for phase 1 via the expression    @xmath37    and the _ autocovariance _ function    @xmath38    for phase 1 is equal to that for phase 2 .",
    "generally , for @xmath39 ,    @xmath40    and in the absence of any _ long - range _ order ,    @xmath41    an important necessary condition of realizable @xmath35 for a two - phase statistically homogeneous medium with @xmath3 dimensions is that the @xmath3-dimensional fourier transform of the autocovariance function @xmath42 , denoted by @xmath43 must be non - negative for all wave vectors @xcite , i.e. , for all @xmath44    @xmath45    this non - negativity result is sometimes called the wiener - khintchine condition , which physically results since @xmath43 is proportional to the scattered radiation intensity .",
    "the two - point correlation function must satisfy the following bounds for all @xmath2    @xmath46    and the corresponding bounds on the autocovariance function are given by @xmath47    a corollary of eq .",
    "( [ eq113 ] ) recently derived by torquato @xcite states that the infimum of any two - point correlation function of a statistically homogeneous medium must satisfy the inequalities    @xmath48 \\le \\phi_i^2.\\ ] ]    another necessary condition on @xmath35 in the case of statistically homogeneous and isotropic media , i.e. , when @xmath35 is dependent only the distance @xmath49 , is that its derivative at @xmath50 is strictly negative for all @xmath51 :    @xmath52    this is a consequence of the fact that slope at @xmath53 is proportional to the negative of the specific surface @xcite .",
    "taking that it is axiomatic that @xmath54 is an even function , i.e. , @xmath55 , then it is non - analytic at the origin .",
    "a lesser - known necessary condition for statistically homogeneous media is the so - called `` triangular inequality '' that was first derived by shepp @xcite and later rediscovered by matheron @xcite :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 .",

    "the triangular inequality implies several point - wise conditions on the two - point correlation function .",
