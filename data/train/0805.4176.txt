    "collisional processes have an important rle in dusty plasmas in laboratory or in the environment , as for the dust - acoustic and dust - ion - acoustic wave propagation and instabilities @xcite .",
    "in particular @xcite , collisions between the charged dust particles and the neutrals are relevant , in view of the usually small degree of ionization in applications .",
    "ion - neutrals collisions are also fundamental in experimental observation of dust - acoustic waves @xcite , while dust - neutrals collisions are related to the generation of dust - acoustic waves driven by gravity @xcite . on the other hand , drifting populations are ubiquitous in complex plasmas .",
    "this occurs for ion - dust streaming instabilities @xcite , electrostatic dust - cyclotron instabilities in collisional magnetoplasmas @xcite and for current - driven ion - acoustic instabilities in complex plasmas @xcite .    in most of the above applications @xcite ,",
    "there is some streaming between electrons and/or ions relative to the dust , in the same direction of the motion .",
    "in contrast , the present work consider a _",
    "perpendicular _ drift of the ions , relative to the bulk dust motion .",
    "ions and electrons are taken in local thermodynamical equilibrium , which is equivalent to disregarding their inertia , while the dust fluid is assumed to be cold .",
    "similar models were proposed for dust kinetic alfvn waves in dust - ion plasmas @xcite , but without the perpendicular ion drift . as shown in the following ,",
    "this ion drift is responsible for the generation of periodic magnetic field patterns .",
    "notice that structures like braids , kinks and filaments at jupiter s rings can be a consequence of an ambient magnetic field pattern and the associated force balance for the charged dust particles @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "the necessary equations describing the electron , ion and dust fluids and the electromagnetic field are proposed in section 2 . assuming a slab geometry , the system is then reduced to a nonlinear partial differential equation for the @xmath0-component of the vector potential .",
    "this equation is studied in the linear and in the stationary limit .",
    "linear solutions are shown to be unstable and to present a singular growth - rate for small wave - numbers .",
    "in addition , it is proved in the appendix that the divergence of the growth - rate is related to a too fast characteristic time - scale , outside the range of validity of the model . on the other hand ,",
    "the stationary solutions are described by a nonlinear second - order ordinary differential equation , the lienard equation , whose solutions shown periodic behavior . in section iii , the illustrative and relevant situation where electrons are fully depleted into the dust grains is discussed . here",
    "the fundamental partial differential equation for the vector potential reduces to a burger s like equation and there is no singularity in the dispersion relation .",
    "section 4 is dedicated to the final remarks .",
    "consider a plasma composed by electrons and ions , as well as by massive , negatively charged dust grains . as a first approximation",
    ", we take inertialess ( in comparison to the dust particles ) electrons and ions . for characteristic time",
    "scales much greater than the typical dust charge fluctuation time , the dust charge can be taken as a constant . assuming a slab geometry , the basic equations are @xmath1 in ( [ e1]-[e6 ] ) , the ion , electron and dust charges are @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively , where @xmath5 is the dust charge number and @xmath2 the elementary charge .",
    "in addition , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the ion , electron and dust particle densities .",
    "the ions are assumed to have a perpendicular drift velocity @xmath8 , the negative sign chosen for later convenience .",
    "drifting electrons could also be present , but here ions were preferred since in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas frequently the electron population is negligible ( @xmath9 ) due to electron charge depletion into dust grains @xcite .",
    "also , any current arising from dust grain flows is neglected , since it is smaller than the ion current by a factor @xmath10 at least , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the ion and dust masses , respectively . in this context , the magnetic field generation is due to the drifting ions only .",
    "also , in the above equations @xmath13 is the magnetic field , @xmath14 the @xmath15 component of the electric field , @xmath16 the @xmath15 component of the dust velocity , @xmath17 the dust - neutrals collision frequency and @xmath18 the ion ( electron ) temperature , while the dust fluid is cold .",
    "collisions between electrons and neutrals or between ions and neutrals are not taken into account . from ampre s law ( [ e5 ] ) it is implicit that @xmath19 is the total and @xmath20 is the average ion number densities , so that @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "a similar model @xcite was recently proposed for a current - carrying electron - ion , non - dusty plasma .    in ( [ e6 ] )",
    ", quasineutrality is assumed , which is a good approximation for low - frequency phenomena .",
    "for the same reason , the displacement current is neglected , as well as the additional drifts arising from the generated magnetic field . in this context , disregarding these hall - type currents is the most delicate assumption , more throughly discussed in the appendix . there",
    "it is shown that these perpendicular motions can be discarded in a sufficiently slow time - scale .",
    "the ion drag force due to momentum transfer between ions and charged dust grains is also not taken into account .",
    "this imply , in particular , that the treatment is adequate for the co - rotating distance at the main @xmath23 saturn s rings , so that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the equilibrium ion and dust speeds and @xmath27 is the thermal speed of ions . for outer rings ,",
    "the plasma ions overtake the dust grains , while for smaller distances the ions are slower than the dust fluid . in both cases ,",
    "significant momentum transfer takes place and more detailed models are needed @xcite .",
    "however , the present work is basically concerned with the emergence of magnetic field patterns in highly collisional dusty plasmas , so that these effects are neglected .",
    "the model is still valid for the co - rotating distance at saturn s rings ( where @xmath15 refers to the azimuthal direction ) and for specially devised laboratory experiments .",
    "from now on we use the rescaled variables @xmath28 for @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the speed of light , @xmath31 the ion debye length and @xmath32 the ion plasma frequency .",
    "as will be seen in the continuation , @xmath33 plays a major rle as a maximal wave - number for linearly unstable modes .",
    "also , it is implicit from ( [ e13 ] ) that all wave - numbers are normalized to @xmath33 and that all frequencies and growth - rates are normalized to @xmath34 .    for simplicity of notation , the bars will be dropped then , if the electrostatic and vector potentials are denoted by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 , @xmath38 , then ( [ e2]-[e4 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) gives @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ratio between the equilibrium electron and ion densities .",
    "notice that the @xmath0 or @xmath41 components of the model equations as well as faraday s law are of no concern , since ( [ e1]-[e6 ] ) form a closed system .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ e8 ] ) allows to express @xmath42 while then ( [ e9 ] ) gives @xmath43 taking into account ( [ e10]-[e15 ] ) , all quantities can be written in terms of @xmath44 alone .",
    "the only remaining equation is ( [ e1 ] ) , which leads to @xmath45 =   \\nonumber   \\\\",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the resulting equation seems to be too complicated to be treated in full generality . in this section",
    ", only the linear and the stationary limits will be considered . in section iii , the complete depletion case ( @xmath46 ) will also be shown to be amenable to some more detailed analysis .    in the linear regime , ( [ e16 ] ) reduces to @xmath47 = ( 1 - \\rho ) \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2 } \\left[\\frac{\\partial^2 a_y}{\\partial x^2 } + a_y \\right ] \\,.\\ ] ] assuming @xmath48 $ ] then gives the dispersion relation @xmath49 taking into account that @xmath50 because the dust grains are negatively charged , ( [ e18 ] ) corresponds to instability ( @xmath51 ) provided @xmath52 otherwise there is an evanescent mode .",
    "in addition , in terms of dimensional variables , ( [ e19 ] ) reveals that the wave - number @xmath33 corresponds to marginal stability , with @xmath33 given by ( [ k0 ] ) . also , for @xmath53 , so that @xmath54 , the growth - rate becomes smaller . in other words ,",
    "the present instability is intrinsically dependent on the dust , disappearing for electron - ion plasmas .    for @xmath55 ,",
    "the growth - rate becomes singular .",
    "in several applications , one has @xmath56 as a number not too far from unity .",
    "this corresponds to wavelengths which are small but still much higher than the ion debye wavelength .",
    "therefore , a breakdown of the quasineutrality assumption is not a sufficient reason for ruling out the singularity as unimportant .",
    "moreover , if the poisson equation is taken into account it can be shown that a ( slightly modified ) singularity is still present . also notice that the singularity disappears when @xmath57 .    the clue to solve the problem is to notice that , when the growth - rate is too large , all quantities , and the magnetic field in particular , would change in a fast time - scale , in contradiction to the hypothesis of the model .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the neglect of the additional drifts in the @xmath58direction due to the generated magnetic field ( hall effect ) . to prevent the emergence of a fast time - scale behavior",
    ", the wave - number has to be further bounded from bellow according to @xmath59 where the full expression for @xmath60 is derived in the appendix , see ( [ a6 ] ) .    besides the small amplitude case , another relevant limit is the stationary one , so that @xmath61 . in this case",
    ", the left - hand side of ( [ e16 ] ) identically vanishes . the right - hand side , after integrated once assuming , for the sake of definiteness , that @xmath62 and @xmath63 vanishes at @xmath64 , we derive , after some simple algebra , @xmath65}{1 + d^2 a_{y}/dx^2}\\right ) = 0 \\ , . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] defining @xmath66 ,",
    "one of the equilibria is found when the first factor in ( [ e20 ] ) is zero , @xmath67 this is in the class of lienard equations @xcite and is the same equation found for the stationary magnetic field of a collisional current - carrying ( non - dusty ) plasma @xcite .",
    "observe that , by differentiation of ( [ e14 ] ) , the magnetic fields corresponding to ( [ e21 ] ) are associated to zero electric fields and dust velocities @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , from ( [ e7 ] ) the electron density would be constant , while from ( [ e8]-[e9 ] ) it is seen that the ion and dust populations appear modulated .",
    "the lienard equation has an exact parametric solution @xcite , but here we content ourselves with a numeric solution , as in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) , showing a typical periodic behavior for @xmath68 .    for @xmath69 , however , there is a second possibility for the stationary magnetic field , where the second factor in ( [ e20 ] ) vanishes . after differentiating ,",
    "this can be shown to imply @xmath70 the further rescaling @xmath71 converts ( [ e22 ] ) into the same lienard equation as before , @xmath72 despite the fact that both stationary states are described by the same ( up to a rescaling ) equation , there remains the conclusion that there are two possible nonlinear structures , provided @xmath69 .",
    "it is well - known that complete depletion of the electronic population is not possible , since the minimum value of @xmath73 is the ratio between the electron and ion masses , assuming @xmath74 and point dust particles @xcite .",
    "however , in some cases , assuming @xmath46 is a useful approximation . in such dust - ion plasmas ,",
    "the wave dynamics is determined only by the inertia of the dust grains and the pressure of the ion fluid @xcite .",
    "this is a relevant scenario , in particular , for laboratory experiments on dust - acoustic waves @xcite , certain stages of protostellar cloud collapse @xcite , the saturn s @xmath75 ring @xcite and for halley s comet @xcite .",
    "postulating @xmath76 , together with integrating ( [ e16 ] ) once , leads to @xmath77 this is a much more simpler diffusive burger s like equation , in comparison with ( [ e16 ] ) .",
    "it is formally the same as the equation for the magnetic field in a current - carrying electron - ion ( non dusty ) plasma @xcite .",
    "the results from section 3 about linear waves and stationary states directly translate to ( [ e25 ] ) . for the linear waves , @xmath76 in ( [ e18 ] ) gives @xmath78 , which is an unstable mode for @xmath79 . here",
    "there is no singularity . concerning the stationary states ,",
    "they are described by a lienard equation , as apparent either from ( [ e25 ] ) with time - independent @xmath80 or from ( [ e20 ] ) with total electron depletion . inverting the rescaling ( [ k0 ] )",
    ", there follows the growth - rate @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the dimensional wave - number .",
    "the resemblance between ( [ e25 ] ) and burger s equation suggests the use of a cole - hopf transformation , which converts the burger s equation into a diffusion equation . this is a convincing method to see that the dissipative term of burger s equation prevents the formation of a shock .",
    "therefore , it is illustrative to consider the cole - hopf transformation also for ( [ e25 ] ) , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a function to be determined . inserting ( [ s2 ] ) into ( [ e25 ] ) yields @xmath85 = 0 \\,,\\ ] ] or @xmath86 where @xmath87 is an arbitrary function of time only .",
    "however , this gauge function can be eliminated by @xmath88 where @xmath89 satisfies the linear equation @xmath90 so that @xmath91 satisfies the same equation ( [ s4 ] ) as @xmath92 , but with @xmath93 . since @xmath92 and @xmath91 produces the same magnetic field through ( [ s2 ] ) , one can define @xmath94 without loss of generality to arrive at @xmath95 it would be a diffusion equation , except for the last ( nonlinear ) term .    the stationary states where @xmath96 are associated to the solutions of a hamiltonian system , @xmath97 from figure [ fig2 ] for the potential @xmath98 , one conclude about the existence of stable periodic solutions around @xmath99 and hence about the periodic structure of the stationary magnetic fields .",
    "these results applies directly also to the case of a current - carrying electron - ion plasma @xcite .",
    "in this work , a perpendicular ( with respect to the main flow direction ) drifting ion population was considered as a possible source of periodic magnetic structures in dusty plasmas .",
    "the basic equations reduce to a partial differential equation of diffusive type for the @xmath41-component of the magnetic field . for small amplitude solutions ,",
    "it was identified a linear instability , while the time - independent solutions are described by lienard s equation .",
    "the periodic character of the solutions for the lienard s equation can be associated to nonlinear magnetic field structures in space and laboratory dusty plasmas .",
    "the results are applicable , in particular , for highly collisional dusty plasmas , where there is a noticeable momentum transfer due to dust - neutrals collisions .",
    "natural improvements are the inclusion of the ion and electron masses , as well as taking into account ion - dust or electron - dust momentum exchanges .",
    "also a relevant open question is about the ( nonlinear ) stability of the predicted magnetic field structures .",
    "taking into account the @xmath0 component of the force equation for the dust and @xmath101 as the @xmath58component of the electric field , one get @xmath102 where dimensional variables are used .",
    "it is evident from ( [ a1]-[a2 ] ) that the magnetic field should not change in a too fast time - scale .",
    "while the condition is clearly achieved in equilibrium , this is not what happens in the linear regime when approaching the singularity @xmath103 , with @xmath56 given in ( [ e20 ] ) .",
    "more exactly , using ( [ e10 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) and from now on the rescaled variables , ( [ a1 ] ) is rephrased as @xmath104 in ( [ e3 ] ) , @xmath105 is the ion thermal velocity and the ion plasma frequency is @xmath106 . except if the electrostatic potential significantly changes in a short spatial distance , ( [ a3 ] ) is usually fairly satisfied both in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "more detailed conclusions can be found in the linear regime , which is also the most problematic .",
    "indeed , diffusion and nonlinear effects are expected to prevents the development of the singularity predicted for @xmath103 . for small amplitude waves , ( [ e15 ] )",
    "gives @xmath107 taking into account ( [ a4 ] ) and after fourier transforming ( [ a3 ] ) , there follows @xmath108 where @xmath109 is given by the dispersion relation ( [ e18 ] ) .",
    "now some algebra shows that ( [ a5 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath110 , where @xmath111^{1/2}}{2 m_d c \\nu_{dn}(1 + \\frac{t_i \\rho } { t_{e}})/(z_d m_i v_{ti } \\omega_{pi } ) } \\,.\\ ] ] in particular , for the fully depleted electrons case , the smallest allowable wave - number reduces to the much simpler form @xmath112 while , in the absence of dust , it reduces to @xmath113 for instance @xcite , in comet tails with @xmath114 and a small fraction @xmath115 , one can apply ( [ a8 ] ) with @xmath116 , yielding @xmath117 . also notice that in the pure electron - ion case , @xmath60 as given by ( [ a8 ] ) is the same as @xmath56 in ( [ e19 ] ) .    as apparent from either ( [ a6 ] ) or ( [ a7 ] ) , without discussing the rle of the remaining parameters , the range of validity of the model increases for a larger dust - neutrals collision frequency",
    "this is natural , since perpendicular drifts tends to be inhibited in a strongly collisional medium .",
    "as an example , consider the plasma parameters in the vicinity of saturn s main @xmath118 and @xmath80 rings , as recently measured by the cassini spacecraft orbiter and shown in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "such planetary rings are basically a dusty plasma with low degree of ionization . indeed , the cassini measurements reports on an oxygen atmosphere and an ionospheric plasma near saturn s main rings .",
    "there the ratio between the ion @xmath119 and neutral molecular oxygen @xmath120 densities is as low as @xmath121 , so that ion - neutral momentum transfer is expected to be a relevant process .",
    "for @xcite the plasma parameters @xmath122 , one get from ( [ a6 ] ) the range @xmath123 .",
    "better results could be found for outer rings like saturn s @xmath75 ring , where @xmath124 has much smaller values @xcite .",
    "for these distances , however , the plasma ions significantly overtake the dust grains , so that momentum exchanges between ions and charged dust grains should be considered @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the singularity predicted by the linear theory for @xmath125 is unphysical , since @xmath56 as given by ( [ e19 ] ) is smaller than @xmath60 . considering the large degree of depletion ,",
    "if one uses ( [ g ] ) with @xmath126 and @xmath127 one roughly estimate the maximum growth - rate as @xmath128 .    a practical way to reach smaller wave - numbers is to enlarge the dust - neutrals collision frequency , which can be calculated @xcite from @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the neutrals mass , @xmath131 the neutrals number density , @xmath132 the neutrals thermal speed and where the dust grains where assumed to be all spheres of radius @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , for space plasmas or for laboratory experiments , for smaller @xmath134 s one should have , in particular , the largest possible neutrals mass density combined to the largest neutrals thermal velocity .",
    "in addition , it follows from ( [ a6 ] ) that larger wave - lengths are achieved for larger values of @xmath135 .    as a final example",
    ", one can choose parameters appropriated to the dust - acoustic instability .",
    "the dust - acoustic experiments are promising , since they consider a small ionization fraction ( @xmath136 ) , so that the ion drag force is smaller than the neutral friction even if @xmath17 is smaller than the ion - dust collision frequency @xcite . following @xcite ,",
    "take @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 . combining ( [ a6 ] ) and ( [ a9 ] ) , there follows @xmath147 .",
    "this small value comes basically from the large ratio @xmath135 .",
    "finally , the maximal growth - rate can be estimated using ( [ e18 ] ) , since now the depletion is not so high . considering ( [ e18 ] ) with @xmath148 , and for @xmath127 , there follows the value @xmath149 for the growth - rate .",
