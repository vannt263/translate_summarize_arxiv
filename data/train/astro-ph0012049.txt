    "2000 ) or with rx 185635 - 3754 ( walter 2000 ) also implies a kick to the ns .",
    "the current paradigm for core - collapse supernovae leading to ns formation is that these supernovae are neutrino - driven ( see bethe 1990 , burrows 2000 , janka 2000 for recent review ) : as the central core of a massive star collapses to nuclear density , it rebounds and sends off a shock wave , leaving behind a proto - neutron star .",
    "the shock stalls at several 100 s km because of neutrino loss and nuclear dissociation in the shock . a fraction of the neutrinos emitted from the proto - neutron star get absorbed by nucleons behind the shock , thus reviving the shock , leading to an explosion on the timescale several 100 s ms",
    " this is the so - called `` delayed mechanism '' .",
    "however , 1d simulations with detailed neutrino transport seem to indicate that neutrino heating of the stalled shock , by itself , does not lead to an explosion or produce the observed supernova energetics ( see rampp & janka 2000 ) . it has been argued that neutrino - driven convection in the proto - neutron star ( which tends to increase the neutrino flux ) and that in the shocked mantle ( which tends to increase the neutrino heating efficiency ) are central to the explosion mechanism , although there is no consensus on the robustness of these convections ( e.g. , bethe 1990 ; herant et al .",

    "it is clear that despite decades of theoretical investigations , our understanding of the physical mechanisms of core - collapse supernovae remains significantly incomplete .",
    "the prevalence of neutron star kicks poses a significant mystery , and indicates that large - scale , global deviation from spherical symmetry is an important ingredient in our understanding of core - collapse supernovae ( see burrows 2000 ) .    in the following sections , we review different classes of physical mechanisms for generating ns kicks (   3 - 5 ) , and then discuss possible observational constraints and astrophysical implications (  6 ) .",
    "the collapsed stellar core and its surrounding mantle are susceptible to a variety of hydrodynamical ( convective ) instabilities ( e.g. , herant et al .  1994 ; burrows et al .",
    "1995 ; janka & mller 1996 ; keil et al .  1996 ; mezzacappa et al .  1998 ) .",
    "it is natural to expect that the asymmetries in the density , temperature and velocity distributions associated with the instabilities can lead to asymmetric matter ejection and/or asymmetric neutrino emission .",
    "numerical simulations , however , indicate that the local , post - collapse instabilities are not adequate to account for kick velocities @xmath16  km  s@xmath0 ( janka & mller 1994 ; burrows & hayes 1996 ; janka 1998 ; keil 1998 )  these simulations were done in 2d , and it is expected that the flow will be smoother on large scale in 3d simulations , and the resulting kick velocity will be even smaller .",
    "there is now a consensus that global asymmetric perturbations in presupernova cores are required to produce the observed kicks hydrodynamically ( goldreich , lai & sahrling 1996 ; burrows & hayes 1996 ) .",
    "numerical simulations by burrows & hayes ( 1996 ) demonstrate that if the precollapse core is mildly asymmetric , the newly formed ns can receive a kick velocity comparable to the observed values .",
    "( in one simulation , the density of the collapsing core exterior to @xmath17 and within @xmath18 of the pole is artificially reduced by @xmath19 , and the resulting kick is about @xmath20  km  s@xmath0 . ) asymmetric motion of the exploding material ( since the shock tends to propagate more `` easily '' through the low - density region ) dominates the kick , although there is also contribution ( about @xmath21 ) from asymmetric neutrino emission .",
    "the magnitude of kick velocity is proportional to the degree of initial asymmetry in the imploding core .",
    "thus the important question is : what is the origin of the initial asymmetry ?",
    "goldreich et al .  (",
    "1996 ) suggested that overstable g - mode oscillations in the presupernova core may provide a natural seed for the initial asymmetry .",
    "these overstable g - modes arise as follows .",
    "a few hours prior to core collapse , a massive star ( @xmath22 ) has gone through a successive stages of nuclear burning , and attained a configuration with a degenerate iron core overlaid by an `` onion skin '' mantle of lighter elements .",
    "the rapidly growing iron core is encased in and fed by shells of burning silicon and oxygen , and the entire assemblage is surrounded by a thick convection zone .",
    "the nearly isothermal core is stably stratified and supports internal gravity waves .",
    "these waves can not propagate in the unstably stratified convection zone , hence they are trapped and give rise to core g - modes in which the core oscillates with respect to the outer parts of the star .",
    "the overstability of the g - mode is due to the `` @xmath23-mechanism '' with driving provided by temperature sensitive nuclear burning in si and o shells surrounding the core before it implodes .",
    "it is simplest to see this by considering a @xmath24 mode : if we perturb the core to the right , the right - hand - side of the shell will be compressed , resulting in an increase in temperature ; since the shell nuclear burning rate depends sensitively on temperature ( power - law index @xmath25 for si burning and @xmath26 for o burning ) , the nuclear burning is greatly enhanced ; this generates a large local pressure , pushing the core back to the left .",
    "the result is an oscillating g - mode with increasing amplitude .",
    "presupernova model of weaver and woosley ( 1993 ) .",
    "the solid curve shows @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the brunt - visl frequency ; the dashed curves show @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the acoustic cutoff frequency , with @xmath31 . the spikes in @xmath27 result from discontinuities in entropy and composition .",
    "the iron core boundary is located at @xmath32 , the mass - cut at @xmath33 .",
    "convective regions correspond to @xmath34 .",
    "gravity modes ( with mode frequency @xmath35 ) propagate in regions where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , while pressure modes propagate in regions where @xmath38 and @xmath39 . note that a g - mode trapped in the core can lose energy by penetrating the evanescent zones and turning into an outgoing acoustic wave ( see the horizontal line ) . also note that g - modes with higher @xmath40 ( the radial order ) and @xmath41 ( the angular degree ) are better trapped in the core than those with lower @xmath40 and @xmath41.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    -3truecm    the main damping mechanism comes from the leakage of mode energy .",
    "the local ( wkb ) dispersion relation for nonradial waves is k_r^2=(^2c_s^2)^-1(^2-l_l^2)(^2-n^2 ) , where @xmath42 is the radial wavenumber , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 is the sound speed ) and @xmath28 are the acoustic cut - off ( lamb ) frequency and the brunt - visl frequency , respectively . since acoustic waves",
    "whose frequencies lie above the acoustic cutoff can propagate through convective regions , each core g - mode will couple to an outgoing acoustic wave , which drains energy from the core g - modes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this leakage of mode energy can be handled with an outgoing propagation boundary condition in the mode calculation .",
    "also , neutrino cooling tends to damp the mode .",
    "since the nuclear energy generation rate depends more sensitively on temperature than pair neutrino emission ( power law index @xmath45 ) , cooling is never comparable to nuclear heating locally . instead",
    ", thermal balance is mediated by the convective transport of energy from the shells , where the rate of nuclear energy generation exceeds that of neutrino energy emission , to the cooler surroundings where the bulk of the neutrino emission takes place .",
    "calculations ( based on the @xmath46 and @xmath47 presupernova models of weaver & woosley 1993 ) indicate that a large number of g - modes are overstable , although for low - order modes ( small @xmath41 and @xmath40 ) the results depend sensitively on the detailed structure and burning rates of the presupernova models .",
    "the typical mode periods are @xmath48  s , the growth time @xmath49  s , and the lifetime of the si shell burning is @xmath50 hours ( lai & goldreich 2000b , in preparation ) .",
    "our tentative conclusion is that overstable g - modes can potentially grow to large amplitudes prior to core implosion , although a complete understanding of the global pre - collapse asymmetries is probably out of reach at present , given the various uncertainties in the presupernova models .",
    "for example , the o - si burning shell is highly convective , with convective speed reaching @xmath51 of the sound speed , and hydrodynamical simulation may be needed to properly modeled such convection zones ( see bazan & arnett 1998 , asida & arnett 2000 ) .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested that the convection itself may provide the seed of asymmetry in the presupernova core ( bazan & arnett 1998 ) , although it is not clear whether the perturbations have sufficiently large scales to be relevant to supernova kicks .",
    "core collapse proceeds in a self - similar fashion , with the inner core shrinking subsonically and the outer core falling supersonically at about half free - fall speed ( goldreich & weber 1980 ; yahil 1983 ) .",
    "the inner core is stable to non - radial perturbations because of the significant role played by pressure in its subsonic collapse ( goldreich & weber 1980 ) .",
    "pressure is less important in the outer region , making it more susceptible to large scale instability .",
    "a recent stability analysis of yahil s self - similar collapse solution ( which is based on newtonian theory and a polytropic equation of state @xmath52 , with @xmath53 ) does not reveal any unstable global mode before the proto - neutron star forms ( hanawa & matsumoto 2000 ; lai 2000 ) .",
    "however , during the subsequent accretion of the outer core ( involving @xmath54 of the core mass ) and envelope onto the proto - neutron star , nonspherical lagrangian perturbations can grow according to @xmath55 ( independent of @xmath41 ) or even @xmath56 ( for @xmath24 when the central collapsed object is displaced from the origin of the converging flow ) ( lai & goldreich 2000 ) the asymmetric density perturbations seeded in the presupernova star , especially those in the outer region of the iron core , are therefore amplified ( by a factor of 5 - 10 ) during collapse .",
    "the enhanced asymmetric density perturbation may lead to asymmetric shock propagation and breakout , which then give rise to asymmetry in the explosion and a kick velocity to the ns ( see burrows & hayes 1996 ) .",
    "the second class of kick mechanisms rely on asymmetric neutrino emission induced by strong magnetic fields .",
    "since @xmath57 of the ns binding energy ( a few times @xmath58  erg ) is released in neutrinos , tapping the neutrino energy would appear to be an efficient means to kick the newly - formed ns .",
    "the fractional asymmetry @xmath59 in the radiated neutrino energy required to generate a kick velocity @xmath60 is @xmath61 ( @xmath62 for @xmath63  km  s@xmath0 , ns mass @xmath64 and total neutrino energy radiated @xmath65  erg ) .",
    "because weak interaction is parity violating , the neutrino opacities and emissivities in a magnetized nuclear medium depend asymmetrically on the directions of neutrino momenta with respect to the magnetic field , and this can give rise to asymmetric neutrino emission from the proto - neutron star . chugai ( 1984 ) ( who gave an incorrect expression for the electron polarization in the relativistic , degenerate regime ) and vilenkin ( 1995 ) considered neutrino - electron scattering , but this is less important than neutrino - nucleon scattering in determining neutrino transport in proto - neutron stars .",
    "dorofeev et al .",
    "( 1985 ) considered neutrino emission by urca processes , but failed to recognize that in the bulk interior of the star the asymmetry in neutrino emission is cancelled by that associated with neutrino absorption ( lai & qian 1998a ) .",
    "horowitz & li ( 1998 ) suggested that large asymmetries in the neutrino flux could result from the cumulative effect of multiple scatterings of neutrinos by slightly polarized nucleons ( see also lai & qian 1998a ; janka 1998 ) .",
    "however , it can be shown that , although the scattering cross - section is asymmetric with respect to the magnetic field for individual neutrinos , detailed balance requires that there be no cumulative effect associated with multiple scatterings in the bulk interior of the star where thermal equilibrium is maintained to a good approximation ( arras & lai 1999a ; see also kusenko et al .",
    "1998 ) . for a given neutrino species ,",
    "there is a drift flux of neutrinos along the magnetic field in addition to the usual diffusive flux .",
    "this drift flux depends on the deviation of the neutrino distribution function from thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus asymmetric neutrino flux can be generated in the outer region of the proto - neutron star ( i.e. , above the neutrino - matter decoupling layer , but below the neutrinosphere ) where the neutrino distribution deviates significantly from thermal equilibrium .",
    "while the drift flux associated with @xmath66 s and @xmath67 s is exactly canceled by that associated with @xmath68 s and @xmath69 s , there is a net drift flux due to @xmath70 s and @xmath71 s .",
    "arras & lai ( 1999b ) found that the asymmetry parameter for the @xmath70-@xmath71 flux is dominated for low energy neutrinos ( @xmath72  mev ) by the effect of ground ( landau ) state electrons in the absorption opacity , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , and for high energy neutrinos by nucleon polarization ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "averaging over all neutrino species , the total asymmetry in neutrino flux is of order @xmath76 , and the resulting kick velocity @xmath77  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "there is probably a factor of 5 uncertainty in this estimate . to firm up",
    "this estimate requires solving the neutrino transport equations in the presence of parity violation for realistic proto - neutron stars .",
    "a different kick mechanism relies on the asymmetric magnetic field distribution in proto - neutron stars ( see bisnovatyi - kogan 1993 ; however , he considered neutron decay , which is not directly relevant for neutrino emission from proto - neutron stars ) .",
    "since the cross section for @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) absorption on neutrons ( protons ) depends on the local magnetic field strength due to the quantization of energy levels for the @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) produced in the final state , the local neutrino fluxes emerged from different regions of the stellar surface are different .",
    "calculations indicate that to generate a kick velocity of @xmath80  km  s@xmath0 using this mechanism alone would require that the difference in the field strengths at the two opposite poles of the star be at least @xmath81  g ( lai & qian 1998b ) .",
    "note that unlike the kick due to parity violation ( see  4.1 ) , this mechanism does not require the magnetic field to be ordered , i.e. , only the magnitude of the field matters .",
    "a superstrong magnetic field may also play a dynamical role in the proto - neutron star .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that a locally strong magnetic field can induce `` dark spots '' ( where the neutrino flux is lower than average ) on the stellar surface by suppressing neutrino - driven convection ( duncan & thompson 1992 ) .",
    "while it is difficult to quantify the kick velocity resulting from an asymmetric distribution of dark spots , order - of - magnitude estimate indicates that a local magnetic field of at least @xmath82  g is needed for this effect to be of importance .",
    "much work remains to be done to quantify the magnetic effects ( especially when coupled with rotation ) on the dynamics of the proto - neutron star and the supernova explosion ( see , e.g. , leblanc & wilson 1970 ; thompson & duncan 1993 ) .",
    "there have also been several ideas of pulsar kicks which rely on nonstandard neutrino physics .",
    "it was suggested ( kusenko & segre 1996 ) that asymmetric @xmath67 emission could result from the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein flavor transformation between @xmath67 and @xmath70 inside a magnetized proto - neutron star because a magnetic field changes the resonance condition for the flavor transformation .",
    "this mechanism requires neutrino mass of order @xmath12  ev .",
    "a similar idea ( akhmedov et al",
    ".  1997 ) relies on both the neutrino mass and the neutrino magnetic moment to facilitate the flavor transformation ( resonant neutrino spin - flavor precession ; see also grasso et al .",
    "1998 ; nardi & zuluaga 2000 ) . more detailed analysis of neutrino transport ( janka & raffelt 1998 ) , however , indicates that even with favorable neutrino parameters ( such as mass and magnetic moment ) for neutrino oscillation , the induced pulsar kick is much smaller than previously estimated ( i.e. , @xmath83  g is required to obtain a @xmath12  km  s@xmath0 kick ) .",
    "it is clear that all the kick mechanisms discussed in this section (  4 ) are of relevance only for @xmath84  g. while recent observations have lent strong support that some neutron stars ( `` magnetars '' ) are born with such a superstrong magnetic field ( e.g. , thompson & duncan 1993 ; vasisht & gotthelf 1997 ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998,1999 ; thompson 2000b ) , it is not clear ( perhaps unlikely ) that ordinary radio pulsars ( for which large velocities have been measured ) had initial magnetic fields of such magnitude ( see als  6 ) .",
    "harrison & tademaru ( 1975 ) show that electromagnetic ( em ) radiation from an off - centered rotating magnetic dipole imparts a kick to the pulsar along its spin axis .",
    "the kick is attained on the initial spindown timescale of the pulsar ( i.e. , this really is a gradual acceleration ) , and comes at the expense of the spin kinetic energy .",
    "we ( lai , chernoff & cordes 2001 ) have reexamined this effect and found that the force on the pulsar due to asymmetric em radiation is larger than the original harrison & tademaru expression by a factor of four . if the dipole is displaced by a distance @xmath85 from the rotation axis , and has components @xmath86 ( in cylindrical coordinates ) , the force is given by ( to leading order in @xmath87 ) f=815(sc)^4_z_c^4 .",

    "however , one can not rule out the possibility that in the proto - neutron star phase , a convection - initiated dynamo generates a `` transient '' superstrong magnetic field , lasting a few seconds , and then the field gets destroyed by `` anti - dynamo '' as the convection ceases .",
    "obviously if we can be sure that this is not possible , then we can discard the mechanisms discussed in  4 .      to produce sufficient velocity , the electromagnetic rocket effect (  5 )",
    "requires the ns initial spin period @xmath131 to be less than @xmath132 ms .",
    "it is widely thought that radio pulsars are not born with such a rapid spin , but rather with a more modest @xmath133  s ( e.g. , lorimer et al .",
    "the strongest argument for this comes for the energetics of pulsar nebulae ( particularly crab ) .",
    "but this is not without uncertainties . for example",
    ", a recent analysis of the energetics of the crab nebula suggests an initial spin period @xmath134 ms followed by fast spindown on a time scale of 30 yr ( atoyan 1999 ) . as for the vela pulsar",
    ", the energetics of the remnant do not yield an unambiguous constraint on the initial spin . also , the recent discovery of the 16  ms x - ray pulsar ( psr j0537 - 6910 ) associated with the crab - like supernova remnant n157b ( marshall et al .",
    "1998 ) in the large magellanic cloud implies that at least some nss are born with spin periods in the millisecond range .",
    "so at this point it may be prudent to consider @xmath135  ms as a possibility ( see also  6.5 ) .",
    "there is a qualitative difference between natal kicks ( including the hydrodynamical driven and neutrino  magnetic field driven kicks ) and post - natal kicks . because it is a slow process",
    ", the harrison - tademaru effect may have difficulty in explaining some of the characteristics of ns binaries ( even if the physics issues discussed in  5 work out to give a large @xmath60 ) , such as the spin - orbit misalignment in psr j0045 - 7319 ( kaspi et al .",
    "1996 ) and psr 1913 + 16 ( kramer 1999 ) needed to produce the observed precessions .",
    "for example , in the case of psr j0045 - 7319  b star binary : if we assume that the orbital angular momentum of the presupernova binary is aligned with the spin of the b star , then the current spin - orbit misalignment can only be explained by a fast kick with @xmath136 less than the post - explosion orbital period @xmath137 .",
    "similarly , a slow kick ( with @xmath138 ) may be inconsistent with the ns binary populations ( e.g. , dewey & cordes 1987 ; fryer & kalogera 1997 ; fryer et al .",
    "however , note that @xmath139 for the harrison - tademaru effect depends on value of @xmath127 [ see eq .",
    "( [ taukick ] ) ] , thus can be made much smaller than @xmath137 ( which typically ranges from hours to several months or a few years at most for relevant binaries ) if @xmath127 is large .      despite some earlier claims to the contrary , statistical studies of pulsar population have revealed no correlation between @xmath60 and magnetic field strength , or correlation between the kick direction and the spin axis ( e.g. , lorimer et al .  1995 ; cordes & chernoff 1998 ; deshpande et al .",
    "1999 ) . given the large systematic uncertainties , the statistical results , by themselves , can not reliably constrain any kick mechanism . for example , the magnetic field strengths required for the neutrino - driven mechanisms are @xmath140  g , much larger than the currently inferred dipolar surface fields of typical radio pulsars ; there are large uncertainties in using the polarization angle to determine the pulsar spin axis ; differential galactic rotation is important for distant nss and can not be accounted for unless the distance is known accurately and the ns has not moved far from its birth location ; several different mechanisms ( including binary breakup ) may contribute to the observed ns velocities ( see lai , chernoff & cordes 2001 ) .",
    "recent observations of the vela pulsar and the surrounding compact x - ray nebula with the chandra x - ray observatory reveal a two sided asymmetric jet at a position angle coinciding with the position angle of the pulsar s proper motion ( pavlov et al .",
    "2000 ; see http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cycle1/vela/ for image ) the symmetric morphology of the nebula with respect to the jet direction strongly suggests that the jet is along the pulsar s spin axis .",
    "analysis of the polarization angle of vela s radio emission corroborates this interpretation .",
    "similar evidence for spin - velocity alignment also exists for the crab pulsar .",
    "thus , while statistical analysis of pulsar population neither support nor rule out any spin - kick correlation , at least for the vela and crab pulsars , the proper motion and the spin axis appear to be aligned .",
    "interestingly , both crab and vela pulsars have relatively small transverse velocities ( of order @xmath141 ) .",
    "the apparent alignment between the spin axis and proper motion for the crab and vela pulsar raises an interesting question : under what conditions is the spin - kick alignment expected for different kick mechanisms ? let us look at the three classes of mechanisms discussed in ",
    " 3 - 5 ( see lai , chernoff & cordes 2001 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) neutrino  magnetic field driven kicks : the kick is imparted to the ns near the neutrinosphere ( at 10 s of km ) on the neutrino diffusion time , @xmath143  seconds . as long as the initial spin period @xmath131 is much less than a few seconds , spin - kick alignment is naturally expected .",
    "\\(3 ) hydrodynamically driven kicks : the low - order g - modes trapped in the presupernova core ( @xmath144  km ) have periods of 1 - 2 seconds , much shorter than the rotation period of the core ( unless the core possesses a dynamically important angular momentum after collapse ) , thus the g - modes are not affected by rotation .",
    "also , since the rotational speed of the core is typically less than the speed of convective eddies ( @xmath1451000 - 2000  km  s@xmath0 , about @xmath19 of the sound speed ) in the burning shell surrounding the iron core , rotation should not significantly affect the shell convection either .",
    "thus the development of large - scale presupernova ( dipolar ) asymmetry is not influenced by the core rotation .",
    "but even though the primary thrust to the ns ( upon core collapse ) does not depend on spin , the net kick will be affected by rotational averaging if the asymmetry pattern ( near the shock breakout ) rotates with the matter at a period shorter than the kick timescale @xmath136 . here",
    "the situation is more complicated because the primary kick to the ns is imparted at a large radius , @xmath146  km ( since this the location of the stalled shock ) . to obtain effective spin averaging",
    ", we require the rotation period at @xmath147 to be shorter than @xmath148  ms ( this @xmath136 is the shock travel time at speed of @xmath149 across @xmath150  km , the radius of the mass cut enclosing @xmath151 ) .",
    "assuming angular momentum conservation , this translates into the requirement that the final ns spin period @xmath152  ms .",
    "we thus conclude that if rotation is dynamically unimportant for the core collapse and explosion ( corresponding to @xmath153  ms ) , then rotational averaging is inefficient and the hydrodynamical mechanism does not produce spin - kick alignment .",
    "the discussion above is based on the standard picture of core - collapse supernovae , which is valid as long as rotation does _ not _ play a dynamically important role ( other than rotational averaging ) in the supernova . if , on the other hand , rotation is dynamically important , the basic collapse and explosion may be qualitatively different ( e.g. , core bounce may occur at subnuclear density , the explosion is weaker and takes the form of two - sided jets ; see mnchmeyer et al .",
    "1991 ; rampp , mller & ruffert 1998 ; khokhlov et al .",
    "1999 ; fryer & heger 1999 ) . the possibility of a kick in such systems has not been studied , but it is conceivable that an asymmetric dipolar perturbation may be coupled to rotation , thus producing spin - kick alignment .    it has been suggested that the presupernova core has negligible angular momentum and the pulsar spin may be generated by off - centered kicks when the ns forms ( spruit & phinney 1998 ) .",
    "it is certainly true that even with zero precollapse angular momentum , some rotation can be produced in the proto - neutron star ( burrows et al .",
    "1995 reported a rotation period of order a second generated by stochastic torques in their 2d simulations of supernova explosions ) , although @xmath154  ms seems difficult to get .",
    "in this picture , the spin will generally be perpendicular to the velocity ; aligned spin - kick may be possible if the kick is the result of many small thrusts which are appropriately oriented ( spruit & phinney 1998 )  this might apply if small - scale convection were responsible for the kick . but as discussed in  3 , numerical simulations indicate that such convection alone does not produce kicks of sufficient amplitude . therefore , spin - kick alignment requires that the proto - neutron star have a `` primordial '' rotation ( i.e. , with angular momentum coming from the presupernova core ) .",
