    "the final twenty - five years of the 20th century saw the rise of two highly successful mathematical models that describe the universe at its two extremes , the very big and the very small .",
    "the standard model of particle physics ( detailed in this volume ) provides a fundamental description of almost all phenomena in the microscopic world .",
    "the standard hot big bang model describes in detail the evolution of the universe from a fraction of a second after the beginning , when it was just a hot soup of elementary particles , to the present some 13.7 billion years later when it is filled with stars , planets , galaxies , clusters of galaxies and us @xcite .",
    "both standard models are consistent with an enormous body of precision data , gathered from high - energy particle accelerators , telescopes and laboratory experiments . the standard model of particle physics and the hot big bang cosmology surely rank among the most important achievements of 20th century science ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "both models raise profound questions .",
    "moreover , the `` big questions '' about the very small and the very large are connected , both in their asking and ultimately in their answering .",
    "this suggests that the deeper understanding that lies ahead will reveal even more profound connections between the quarks and the cosmos .",
    "the big questions include    * how are the forces and particles of nature unified ?",
    "* what is the origin of space , time and the universe ?",
    "* how are quantum mechanics and general relativity reconciled ? * how did the baryonic matter arise in the universe ? * what is the destiny of the universe ? * what is the nature of the dark matter that holds the universe together and of the dark energy that is causing the expansion of the universe to speed up ?",
    "the last question illustrates the richness of the connections between quarks and the cosmos : 96% of the matter and energy that comprises the universe is still of unknown form , is crucial to its existence , and determines its destiny .",
    "dark matter and dark energy are also the most concrete and possibly most important evidence for new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the solution to the dark matter problem seems within reach : we have a compelling hypothesis , namely that it exists in the form of stable elementary particles left over from the big bang ; we know that a small amount of dark matter exists in the form of massive neutrinos ; we have two good candidates for the rest of it ( the axion and neutralino ) and an experimental program to test the particle dark matter hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the situation with cosmic acceleration and dark energy is very different . while we have compelling evidence that the expansion of the universe is speeding up , we are far from a working hypothesis or any significant understanding of cosmic acceleration .",
    "the solution to this profound mystery could be around the corner or very far away .",
    "for mathematical simplicity einstein assumed that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous ; today , we have good evidence that this is the case on scales greater than 100 mpc ( from the distribution of galaxies in the universe ) and that it was at early times on all scales ( from the uniformity of the cosmic microwave background ) . under this assumption ,",
    "the expansion is merely a rescaling and is described by a single function , the cosmic scale factor , @xmath1 .",
    "( by convention , the value of the scale factor today is set equal to 1 . ) the wavelengths of photons moving through the universe scale with @xmath1 , and the redshift that light from a distant object suffers , @xmath2 , directly reveals the size of the universe when that light was emitted : @xmath3 .",
    "the key equations of cosmology are @xmath4 \\ddot r / r                 & = & -{4\\pi g\\over 3}\\,(\\rho + 3p ) + { \\lambda\\over 3 } \\\\[0.1 cm ] w_i \\equiv { p_i\\over \\rho_i}\\ \\ & \\ & \\ \\ \\",

    "the ratio of pressure to energy density is the equation - of - state @xmath7 which , through the conservation of energy , @xmath8 , determines how the energy density evolves . for constant @xmath9 , @xmath10 : for matter ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 and for radiation ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 .",
    "the first of these equations , known as the friedmann equation , is the master equation of cosmology .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 is the 3-curvature of the universe and @xmath16 is the curvature radius ; @xmath17 corresponds to a spatially flat universe , @xmath18 a positively curved universe and @xmath19 a negatively curved universe . because of the evidence from the cosmic microwave background that the universe is spatially flat ( see fig .  1 ) , unless otherwise noted we shall assume @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is einstein s infamous cosmological constant ; it is equivalent to a constant energy density , @xmath22 , with pressure @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 is the deceleration parameter , defined with a minus sign so that @xmath26 corresponds to decelerating expansion .",
    "the energy density of a flat universe ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath27 , is known as the critical density . for a positively curved universe , @xmath28 and for a negatively curved universe @xmath29 .",
    "provided the total pressure is greater than @xmath30 times the total energy density , gravity slows the expansion rate , i.e. , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "because of the @xmath33 term in the @xmath34 equation ( newtonian gravity would only have @xmath5 ) , the gravity of a sufficiently elastic form of energy ( @xmath35 ) is repulsive and causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate . in einstein s static solution ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) the repulsive gravity of @xmath21",
    "is balanced against the attractive gravity of matter , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "a cosmological constant that is larger than this results in accelerated expansion ( @xmath40 ) ; the observed acceleration requires @xmath41 ( 2 - 3)@xmath42 .    for an object of known intrinsic luminosity @xmath43 ,",
    "the measured energy flux @xmath44 defines the luminosity distance @xmath45 to the object ( i.e. , the distance inferred from the inverse square law ) .",
    "the luminosity distance is related to the cosmological model via @xmath46 astronomers determine the luminosity distance from the difference between the apparent magnitude @xmath47 of the object ( proportional to the log of the flux ) and the absolute magnitude @xmath48 ( proportional to the log of the intrinsic luminosity ) , @xmath49 ( where 5 astronomical magnitudes correspond to a factor of 100 in flux or a factor of 10 in luminosity distance ) .",
    "the use of `` standard candles '' ( objects of known intrinsic luminosity @xmath43 ) and measurements of the energy flux @xmath44 constrain the cosmological model through this equation . in particular , the hubble diagram ( or magnitude - redshift diagram ) is the simplest route to probing the expansion history . in terms of the deceleration parameter",
    "the equation is deceptively simple : @xmath50 where the subscript `` 0 '' denotes the value today . while this taylor expansion of eq . ( 5 ) , valid for @xmath51 , is of historical significance and utility , it is not useful today since objects as distant as redshift @xmath52 have been used to probe the expansion history .",
    "however , it does illustrate the general principle : the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "represents the linear hubble expansion , and the deviation from a linear relation reveals the deceleration ( or acceleration ) .      before discussing the evidence for cosmic acceleration",
    ", we will recount some of the history of the cosmological constant . realizing that there was nothing to forbid such a term and that it could be used to obtain an interesting solution ( a static and finite universe ) , einstein introduced the cosmological constant in 1917 . while his static solution was consistent with astronomical observations at that time , hubble s discovery of the expansion of the universe in 1929 led einstein to discard the cosmological constant in favor of expanding models without one , calling the cosmological constant `` my greatest blunder '' .    in 1948 ,",
    "bondi , gold and hoyle put forth the `` steady state cosmology '' , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the model was motivated by the aesthetics of an unchanging universe and a serious age problem ( the measured value of the hubble constant at the time , around 500 km / s / mpc implied an expansion age of only 2 gyr , less than the age of earth ) .",
    "the redshift distribution of radio galaxies , the absence of quasars nearby and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1960s all indicated that we do not live in an unchanging universe and ended this revival of a cosmological constant .",
    "the cosmological constant was briefly resurrected in the late 1960s by petrosian et al @xcite to explain the preponderance of quasars at redshifts around @xmath52 ( as it turns out , this is a real effect : quasar activity peaks around @xmath52 ) . in 1975 weak evidence for a cosmological constant from a hubble diagram of elliptical galaxies extending to redshifts of @xmath55",
    "was presented @xcite .",
    "significant concerns about whether or not elliptical galaxies were good standard candles led to the demise of @xmath21 once again .",
    "shortly thereafter came the rise of the standard cosmology with @xmath56 .",
    "the current attempt at introducing a cosmological constant ( or something similar ) , which is backed up by multiple lines of independent evidence , traces its roots to the inflationary universe scenario and its prediction of a spatially flat universe . in the early 1980s when inflation was introduced ,",
    "the best estimate of the average mass density fell short of the critical density by almost a factor of ten ( @xmath57 ) ; the saving grace for inflation was the large uncertainty associated with measuring the mean matter density . from 1980 to the mid 1990s , as measurement techniques took better account of dark matter , @xmath58 rose to of order 0.5 or so .",
    "however , as the uncertainties got smaller , @xmath58 began converging on a value of around 1/3 , not 1 .",
    "moreover , the predictions of the cold dark matter scenario of structure formation matched observations if @xmath58 was around 1/3 , not 1 .    starting in 1984 and continuing to",
    "just before the discovery of cosmic acceleration , a number of papers suggested the solution to inflation s `` @xmath59 problem '' @xcite was a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "owing to its checkered history , there was not much enthusiasm for this suggestion at first .",
    "however , with time the indirect evidence for @xmath21 grew @xcite , and in 1998 when the supernova evidence for accelerated expansion was presented the cosmological constant was quickly embraced  this time , it was the piece of the puzzle that made everything work .",
    "two breakthroughs enabled the discovery that the universe is speeding up and not slowing down .",
    "the first was the demonstration that type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , the brightest of the supernovae and the ones believed to be associated with the thermonuclear explosions of 1.4 @xmath60 white - dwarf stars pushed over the chandrasekhar mass limit by accretion , are ( nearly ) standard candles @xcite .",
    "the second breakthrough involved the use of large ( of order 100 megapixel ) ccd cameras to search big regions of the sky containing thousands of galaxies for these rare events ( the sn ia rate in a typical galaxy is of the order of one per 100 to 200 years ) . by comparing images of thousands of galaxies taken weeks apart the discovery of sne could be reliably `` scheduled '' on a statistical basis .",
    "two teams working independently in the mid- to late-1990s used took advantage of these breakthroughs to determine the expansion history of the universe .",
    "they both found that distant sne are dimmer than they would be in a decelerating universe , indicating that the expansion has actually been speeding up for the past 5 gyr @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : hub_diag ] . analyzed for a universe with matter and cosmological constant ,",
    "their results provide evidence for @xmath61 at greater than 99% confidence ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : om_ol ] .    since this work",
    ", the two teams have discovered and studied more sne , as have other groups @xcite . not only has the new data confirmed the discovery , but it has also allowed measurements of the equation - of - state of dark energy @xmath62 ( assuming constant @xmath9 ) , and even constrains the time variation of @xmath9 , with the parametrization @xmath63 .    especially important in this regard",
    "are sne with redshifts @xmath64 which indicate that the universe was decelerating at earlier times ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : deceleration ] ) , and hence that dark energy started its domination over the dark matter only recently , at redshift @xmath65 .",
    "this finding is an important reality check : without a long , matter - dominated , slowing phase , the universe could not have formed the structure we see today .",
    "evidence for dark energy comes from several other independent probes .",
    "measurements of the fraction of x - ray emitting gas to total mass in galaxy clusters , @xmath66 , also indicates the presence of dark energy .",
    "because galaxy clusters are the largest collapsed objects in the universe , the gas fraction in them is presumed to be constant and equal to the overall baryon fraction in the universe , @xmath67 ( most of the baryons in clusters reside in the gas ) .",
    "measurements of the gas fraction @xmath66 depend not only on the observed x - ray flux , but also on the distance to the cluster ; therefore , only the correct cosmology will produce distances which make the apparent @xmath66 constant in redshift . using data from the chandra x - ray observatory , allen et al @xcite",
    "have determined @xmath68 to an accuracy of about @xmath69 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : om_ol ] .    cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies provide a record of the universe at simpler time , before structure had developed and when photons were decoupling from baryons @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the multipole power spectrum is dominated by the acoustic peaks that arise from gravitationally driven photon - baryon oscillations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cmb ] ) .",
    "the positions and amplitudes of the acoustic peaks encode much information about the universe , today and at earlier times .",
    "in particular , they indicate that the universe is spatially flat , with a matter density that accounts for only about a quarter of the critical density",
    ". however , the presence of a uniformly distributed energy density with large negative pressure which accounts for three - quarters of the critical density brings everything into good agreement , both with cmb data and the large - scale distribution of galaxies in the universe .",
    "the cmb data of wmap together with large - scale structure data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) provides the following cosmic census @xcite : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the presence of dark energy affects the large - angle anisotropy of the cmb ( the low multipoles ) and leads to the prediction of a small correlation between the galaxy distribution and the cmb anisotropy .",
    "this subtle effect has been observed @xcite ; while not detected at a level of significance that could be called independent confirmation , its presence is a reassuring cross check .",
    "baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , so prominent in the cmb anisotropy ( see fig .  1 ) , leave a smaller characteristic signature in the clustering of galaxies that can be measured today and provide an independent geometric probe of dark energy .",
    "measurements of the bao signature in the correlation function of sdss galaxies constrains the distance to redshift @xmath75 to a precision of 5% @xcite .",
    "while this alone does not establish the existence of dark energy , it serves as a significant complement to other probes , cf . ,  fig .",
    "[ fig : om_w ] .    weak gravitational lensing @xcite  slight distortions of galaxy shapes due to gravitational lensing by intervening large - scale structure  is a powerful technique for mapping dark matter and its clustering .",
    "currently , weak lensing sheds light on dark energy by pinning down the combination @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the amplitude of mass fluctuations on the 8mpc scale @xcite . since other measurements put @xmath77 at @xmath78",
    ", this implies that @xmath79 , consistent with a flat universe whose mass / energy density is dominated by dark energy . in the future , weak lensing will also be very useful in probing the equation - of - state of dark energy @xcite ; see sec .",
    "finally , because the expansion age of the universe , @xmath80 , depends upon the expansion history , the comparison of this age with other independent age estimates can be used to probe dark energy .",
    "the ages of the oldest stars in globular clusters constrain the age of the universe : @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "cmb anisotropy is very sensitive to the age , and wmap data determine it accurately : @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "[ fig : age ] shows that a consistent age is possible if @xmath83 .",
    "agreement on the age of the universe provides an important consistency check as well as confirmation of a key feature of dark energy , its large negative pressure .",
    "sir arthur eddington is quoted as saying , `` it is ( also ) a good rule not to put too much confidence in observational results until they are confirmed by theory '' . while this may seem a bit paradoxical ( or worse yet , an example of blatant theoretical arrogance ) ,",
    "the point is well taken : science is not just a collection of facts , it is also understanding ; if the understanding does not eventually follow new facts , perhaps there is something wrong with the facts .",
    "cosmic acceleration meets the eddington criterion and at the same time presents a stunning opportunity for theorists : general relativity ( gr ) can accommodate accelerated expansion , but gr has yet to provide a deeper understanding of the phenomenon .    within gr ,",
    "a very elastic fluid has repulsive gravity , and , if present in sufficient quantity , can lead to the observed accelerated expansion .",
    "this then is the definition of dark energy : the mysterious , elastic and very smooth form of energy which is responsible for cosmic acceleration and is characterized by an equation - of - state @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "vacuum energy is a concrete example of dark energy .",
    "general covariance requires that the stress energy associated with the vacuum take the form of a constant times the metric tensor .",
    "this implies that it has a pressure equal to minus its energy density , is constant both in space and time , and is mathematically equivalent to a cosmological constant .    the stress energy associated with a homogeneous scalar field @xmath85",
    "can also behave like dark energy .",
    "it takes the form of a perfect fluid with @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the potential energy of the scalar field , dot denotes time derivative , and the evolution of the field @xmath85 is governed by @xmath88 if the scalar field evolves slowly , that is @xmath89 , then @xmath90 and the scalar field behaves like a slowly varying vacuum energy .",
    "while cosmic acceleration can be accommodated within the gr framework , the fundamental explanation could be new gravitational physics . with this as a prelude",
    ", we now briefly review the present theoretical situation .",
    "\\(a ) _ vacuum energy._vacuum energy is both the most plausible explanation and the most puzzling possibility . for almost 80 years",
    "we have known that there should in principle be an energy associated with the zero - point fluctuations of all quantum fields .",
    "moreover , @xmath91 .",
    "however , all attempts to compute the value of the vacuum energy lead to divergent results .",
    "the so - called cosmological constant problem was finally articulated about thirty years ago @xcite . however , because of the success of the standard hot big bang model ( where @xmath56 ) and the absence of good ( or any ) ideas , the problem was largely ignored . with the discovery of cosmic acceleration , the cosmological constant problem is now front and center and can no longer be ignored .    to be more quantitative , the energy density required to explain the accelerated expansion is about three quarters of the critical density or about @xmath92 .",
    "this is tiny compared to energy scales in particle physics ( with the exception of neutrino mass differences ) .",
    "such a small energy precludes solving the problem by simply cutting off the divergent zero - point energy integral at some energy beyond which physics is not yet known .",
    "for example , a cutoff of 100 gev would leave a 54 orders - of - magnitude discrepancy .",
    "if supersymmetry were an unbroken symmetry , fermionic and bosonic zero - point contributions would cancel .",
    "however , if supersymmetry is broken at a scale of order @xmath48 , one would expect that imperfect cancellations leave a finite vacuum energy of the order @xmath93 , which for the favored value of @xmath94 gev to @xmath95 tev , would leave a discrepancy of 50 or 60 orders - of - magnitude .",
    "one approach to the cosmological constant problem involves the idea that the value of the vacuum energy is a random variable which can take on different values in different disconnected pieces of the universe . because a value much larger than needed to explain the observed cosmic acceleration would preclude the formation of galaxies , we could not find ourselves in such a region @xcite .",
    "this very anthropic approach finds a home in the landscape version of string theory @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) _ scalar fields , etc._while introducing a new dynamical degree of freedom can also provide a very elastic form of energy density , it does not solve the cosmological constant problem . in order to roll slowly enough",
    "the mass of the scalar field must be very light , @xmath96gev , and its coupling to matter must be very weak to be consistent with searches for new long - range forces @xcite . unlike vacuum energy ,",
    "scalar - field energy clusters gravitationally , but only on the largest scales and with a very small amplitude @xcite .    the equation - of - state @xmath9 for a scalar field can take on any value between @xmath97 and @xmath95 and in general varies with time .",
    "( it is also possible to have @xmath98 , though at the expense of ghosts , by changing the sign of the kinetic energy term in the lagrangian . )",
    "scalar field models also raise new questions and possibilities : is cosmic acceleration related to inflation ? is dark energy related to dark matter or neutrino mass ?",
    "no firm or compelling connections have been made to either , although interesting possibilities have been suggested .",
    "scalar fields in a very different form can also explain cosmic acceleration .",
    "the topological solitons that arise in broken gauge theories , e.g. , strings , walls and textures , are very elastic , and tangled networks of such defects can on large scales behave like an elastic medium with @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the dimensionality of the network ( @xmath101 for strings , 2 for walls and 3 for textures ) . in this case",
    "@xmath9 is a fixed , rational number .",
    "\\(c ) _ modified gravity._a very different approach holds that cosmic acceleration is a manifestation of new gravitational physics and not of dark energy .",
    "assuming that our 4-d spacetime can still be described by a metric , the operational changes are twofold : ( 1 ) a new version of the friedmann equation governing the evolution of the background spacetime ; ( 2 ) modifications to the equations that govern the growth of the small matter perturbations that evolve into the structure seen in the universe today .",
    "a number of ideas have been explored , from models motivated by higher - dimensional theories and string theory @xcite to generic modifications of the usual gravitational action @xcite .",
    "an aside : one might be concerned that when the assumption of general relativity is dropped the evidence for accelerated expansion might disappear .",
    "this is not the case ; using the deceleration @xmath25 as a kinematic description of the expansion , the sne data still provide strong evidence for a period of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "changes to the friedmann equation are easier to derive , discuss and analyze . in order not to spoil the success of the standard cosmology at early times ( from big - bang nucleosynthesis to the cmb anisotropy to the formation of structure ) , the friedmann equation must reduce to the gr form for @xmath102 . because the matter term scales as @xmath103 and the radiation term as @xmath104 , to be safe any modifications should decrease with redshift more slowly than this . as a specific example , consider the dgp model , which arises from a five - dimensional gravity theory @xcite , and has a 4-d friedmann equation , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is an undetermined scale .",
    "as @xmath107 , there is a ( self ) accelerating solution , with @xmath108 .",
    "the additional term in the friedmann equation , @xmath109 , behaves just like dark energy with an equation - of - state that evolves from @xmath110 ( for @xmath102 ) to @xmath24 in the distant future .",
    "we divide the probes of dark energy into three broad categories : kinematical and dynamical cosmological probes , and laboratory / astrophysical probes .",
    "kinematical tests rely on the measurement of cosmological distances and volumes to constrain the evolution of the scale factor and thus the background cosmological model .",
    "specific techniques include sne ia , cmb , and baryon acoustic oscillations .",
    "the dynamical tests probe the effect of dark energy on perturbations of the cosmological model , including the evolution of the small inhomogeneities in the matter density that give rise to structure in the universe .",
    "specific techniques include the use of gravitational lensing to directly determine the evolution of structure in the dark matter and the study of the growth of the abundance of galaxy clusters to indirectly probe the growth of structure .",
    "a potential probe of dark energy , which at the present seems beyond reach , is to study the clustering of dark energy itself .",

    "both the kinematical and dynamical tests have their greatest probative power at redshifts between about @xmath118 and @xmath119 , for the simple reason that at higher redshifts dark energy becomes increasingly less important , @xmath120 @xcite .",

    "dark energy provides a new twist : because the dark energy density varies slowly if at all , it eventually becomes the dominant form of matter / energy ( around @xmath136 ) ; see fig .",
    "after that , the expansion accelerates and structure formation ceases , leaving in place all the structure that has formed .",
    "the future beyond the present epoch of accelerated expansion is uncertain and depends upon understanding dark energy .",
    "in particular , if dark energy is vacuum energy , acceleration will continue and the expansion will become exponential , leading inevitably to a dark universe .",
    "( in a hundred billion years , the light from all but a few hundred nearby galaxies will be too redshifted to detect . ) on the other hand , if dark energy is explained by a scalar field , then eventually the field relaxes to the minimum of its potential .",
    "if the minimum of the potential energy is zero , the universe again becomes matter dominated and returns to decelerated expansion .",
    "if the minimum of the scalar potential has negative energy density , the energy of dark matter and of scalar field energy will eventually cancel , leading to a recollapse .",
    "finally , if the potential energy at the minimum is positive , no matter how small , accelerated expansion eventually ensues again .",
    "absent dark energy geometry and destiny are linked .",
    "the presence of dark energy severs this relation @xcite and links instead destiny to an understanding of dark energy .",
    "we end our brief review with our list of the ten most important facts about cosmic acceleration      \\2 . within the context of general relativity , cosmic acceleration",
    "can not be explained by any known form of matter or energy , but can be accommodated by a nearly smooth and very elastic ( @xmath137 ) form of energy ( `` dark energy '' ) that accounts for about 75% of the mass / energy content of the universe .",
    "\\3 . taken together , current data ( sne , galaxy clustering , cmb and galaxy clusters ) provide strong evidence for the existence of dark energy and constrain the fraction of critical density contributed by dark energy to be @xmath138% and the equation - of - state to be @xmath139 ( stat ) @xmath140 ( sys ) , with no evidence for variation in @xmath9 .",
    "this implies that the universe decelerated until @xmath55 and age @xmath141 gyr , when it began accelerating .",
    "the simplest explanation for dark energy is the zero - point energy of the quantum vacuum , mathematically equivalent to a cosmological constant . in this case",
    ", @xmath9 is precisely @xmath97 , exactly uniformly distributed and constant in time .",
    "all extant data are consistent with a cosmological constant ; however , all attempts to compute the energy of the quantum vacuum yield a result that is many orders - of - magnitude too large ( or is infinite ) .",
    "there is no compelling model for dark energy .",
    "however there are many intriguing ideas including a new light scalar field , a tangled network of topological defects , or the influence of additional spatial dimensions .",
    "it has also been suggested that dark energy is related to cosmic inflation , dark matter and neutrino mass .",
    ". cosmic acceleration could be a manifestation of gravitational physics beyond general relativity rather than dark energy . while there are intriguing ideas about corrections to the usual gravitational action or modifications to the friedmann equation that can give rise to the observed accelerated expansion",
    ", there is no compelling , self - consistent model for the new gravitational physics that explains cosmic acceleration .",
    "even assuming the universe has precisely the critical density and is spatially flat , the destiny of the universe depends crucially upon the nature of the dark energy .",
    "all three fates  recollapse or continued expansion with and without slowing  are possible .",
    "cosmic acceleration is arguably the most profound puzzle in physics .",
    "its solution could shed light on or be central to unraveling other important puzzles , including the cause of cosmic inflation , the vacuum - energy problem , supersymmetry and superstrings , neutrino mass , new gravitational physics , and dark matter .",
    "\\9 . today , the two most pressing questions about dark energy and cosmic acceleration are : is dark energy something other than vacuum energy ?",
    "does general relativity self consistently describe cosmic acceleration ? establishing that @xmath142 or that it varies with time would rule out vacuum energy ; establishing that the values of @xmath9 determined by the kinematical and dynamical methods are not equal would indicate that gr can not self consistently accommodate accelerated expansion .",
    "dark energy affects the expansion rate of the universe , which in turn affects the growth of structure and the distances to objects .",
    "( in gravity theories other than gr , dark energy may have more direct effects on the growth of structure . )",
    "upcoming ground- and space - based experiments should probe @xmath9 at the percent level and its variation at the ten percent level .",
    "these measurements should dramatically improve our ability to discriminate between vacuum energy and something more exotic as well as testing the self consistency of general relativity .",
    "laboratory- and accelerator - based experiments could also shed light on dark energy .",
    "because of its brevity , this review could not do justice to the extensive literature that now exists ; for readers interested in a more thorough treatment of dark energy and/or a more extensive review , we refer them to refs .",
