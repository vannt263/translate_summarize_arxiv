    "the solution to the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equations found by abrikosov @xcite was used widely @xcite to study the properties of type - ii superconductors at low and high applied magnetic fields @xmath7 , i.e.  close to the lower and upper critical fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . at @xmath8 the intervortex spacing is much larger than the vortex core size if the gl parameter is large , @xmath5 .",
    "therefore in the london model , which is commonly used at low fields @xcite , the order parameter in the superconductor is assumed to be constant . in this case , the flux - line lattice ( fll ) can be treated as a set of independent vortices : the magnetic flux density is a linear superposition of the contributions of individual vortices , and each contribution coincides with the field of an isolated vortex .",
