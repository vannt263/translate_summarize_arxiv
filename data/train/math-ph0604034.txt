    "we seek to develop a model of inelastic processes in the aging materials by employing a 4-d inner material metric tensor @xmath0 as the aging ( damage ) parameter of a material continuum .",
    "aging here implies any variation in the chemical make - up , i.e. , chemical degradation , phase transformation , phase coarsening , nucleation , and growth of micro - defects such as dislocations and voids , shear bands , crazes , micro - cracks , etc .",
    "material engineering and failure analysis indicate that , in addition to the stress and strain tensors , a parameter of state ( the `` aging '' parameter ) is needed to represent on a continuum level the sub - micro and micro - structural changes of material . a kinetic equation for the evolution of the aging parameter will represent the aging process of a material .",
    "the equations of evolution for the material metric g are the euler - lagrange equations resulting from a variational principle .",
    "the conjugate force of the evolution of metric g ( and of the related quantities characterizing the properties of the material ) is the energy - momentum tensor of elasticity introduced by j. eshelby ( see sec.7 below ) .",
    "a 3-d material metric @xmath3 has long been employed as an internal variable in continuum mechanics .",
    "for example , it was used for studying the duality of material and physical relations of the doyle - erikson type in article @xcite , the thermodynamics of a continuum in @xcite , and in @xcite where the curvature of material metric @xmath3 defined by a uniformity mapping of a uniform material was employed as the driving force of the material evolution .",
    "we use the 4-d material metric @xmath0 as an additional state parameter that reflects the aging process .",
    "g is introduce with the largest covariance group allowed by the condition that a small vicinity of each point of the material preserves its topology during the aging process ( see sec .",
    "2 below ) .",
    "we consider the 3-d material metric @xmath3 on the slices @xmath4 of constant physical time as one of the main dynamical variables following the adm ( arnovitt , deser , misner ) presentation of @xmath0 ( see @xcite or sec.2.3 below ) . in that respect , we follow the tradition of the cited works .",
    "what is new in our work is that the smaller ( in comparison to the general relativity ) covariance group of the lagrangian allows us to use the lapse function @xmath5 and the shift vector @xmath6 as independent dynamical variables reflecting the proper material time scale and the intrinsic material flows respectively .",
    "this aging parameter is justified by the observation of shrinkage associated with aging and the subsequent material density variation as well as a change of the resonance atomic frequencies and characteristic relaxation times measured in macroscopical studies . in other words ,",
    "the internal length and time scales change with aging when compared to the corresponding absolute ( physical ) scales .",
    "the most sensitive indicator of aging is a variation of an intrinsic material time scale .",
    "the measurement of time in the laboratory as well as in material ( intrinsic time ) can be accomplished by several methods , the most common of which is the use of oscillating processes such as those found in clocks with a pendulum or crystal - based timepieces .",
    "another way of measuring time is the use of a unidirectional evolution of state . in medieval europe , for example , time was measured by burning a candle which had numbered and colored beeswax strips .",
    "still another method is associated with relaxation processes which require an excitation input to enable a fading response .",
    "electronic relaxation generators employing the discharge of a capacitor and the fading luminescence of phosphorus are both examples of relaxation processes , which are well suited for measuring intrinsic time scale changes because they reflect atomic or interatomic events .",
    "consider an external excitation of a material which responds with a specific change in its state .",
    "the decay or fading of the response constitutes the relaxation process .",
    "the decay can be described by an exponential function ( within certain limits ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is time and @xmath9 is the time constant characterizing the rate of relaxation . usually @xmath9 becomes smaller with an increase in temperature or decrease in pressure .",
    "phosphorous fades more slowly at colder temperatures , for example .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the kinematics of a media with a variable riemannian metric @xmath0 in a 4-d material space - time @xmath1 , embedded into 4-d absolute ( newton s ) space - time @xmath10 with the euclidean metric @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the 3-d `` ground state '' metric tensor is introduced together with the proper time lapse function and the material shift vector field .",
    "we consider mass conservation law in section 3 .",
    "elastic and inelastic strain tensors @xmath12 are introduced in section 4 as a measure of deformation and the `` unstrained state '' respectively .",
    "the lagrangian describing inelastic and elastic processes in media is discussed in section 5 .",
    "a variational formulation of aging theory and the euler - lagrange equations ( equations of elasticity coupled with the aging equations ) are considered in section 6 .",
    "we present the combined system of elasticity and aging equations in section 7 and discuss special cases of the aging equations in section 8 .",
    "corresponding to the material and laboratory symmetries , we consider the space and material balance laws in section 9 . in section 10 the energy - momentum balance law and the decomposition of the energy - momentum tensor into components , including the eshelby tensor and terms related to the aging processes are presented . in the final section",
    "we explore the application of this model to the basic inelastic processes- unconstrained aging , stress relaxation , and creep of a homogeneous rod .",
    "in this section we introduce the basic elements of the kinematics of a continuum with a variable metric , including material space - time @xmath1 , 4d material metric @xmath0 , 4d deformations @xmath13 , slicing of the material space - time by the surfaces of constant physical time @xmath14 , and total , elastic and irreversible strain tensors .",
    "let us consider the 4-d euclidean vector space @xmath15 ( * physical space - time * ) with the standard euclidean metric @xmath11 .",
    "there exists the volume form @xmath16 corresponding to this metric .",

    "we have @xmath21    hyperplanes @xmath22 are endowed with the 3d euclidean metric @xmath23 induced by @xmath11 .",
    "we extend 3d tensor @xmath23 to the degenerate ( 0,2)-tensor @xmath24 in @xmath25 , taking @xmath26 .",
    "a solid is considered here , in a conventional way as a 3d manifold @xmath27 with the boundary @xmath28 , i.e. a set of `` idealized '' material points .",
    "we will use local coordinates @xmath29 which , incidently , may be global coordinates induced by a * reference configuration * i.e. , a diffeomorphic embedding @xmath30 ( @xcite ) .",
    "cylinder @xmath31 ( with the coordinates @xmath32 ) is equipped with the 4d riemannian metric @xmath0 ( material metric ) with the components @xmath33 relative to the coordinates @xmath34 .",
    "space @xmath35 is further referred to as the * material `` space - time''*.    metric @xmath0 defines the 4d volume form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the determinant of the matrix @xmath38 .",
    "an example of such a material metric @xmath0 can be constructed as follows .",
    "extend the reference configuration @xmath39 to the diffeomorphic embedding @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the metric @xmath42 ( here and below we denote by @xmath43 the pullback of a covariant tensor @xmath44 by the differentiable mapping @xmath45 ) .",
    "in the coordinates @xmath46 the matrix of the metric @xmath41 is @xmath47 .",
    "denote by @xmath48 the 4d - volume element defined by the metric @xmath41 .",
    "projection @xmath49 along @xmath50-axes plays the same role in the construction below as in the relativistic elasticity theory ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we require invariance of lagrangian theory with respect to the automorphisms of the bundle @xmath51 ( diffeomorphisms of material space - time @xmath1 onto itself , projecting to @xmath27 , so that material points retains their identity during the material evolution ) preserving the direction of the flow of the `` intrinsic '' time ( see below ) , but not with regard to the whole group of diffeomorphisms of @xmath1 as in gravity theory .",
    "the * history of the deformation * of the body @xmath27 is represented by a * diffeomorphic embedding * @xmath52 of the material space - time @xmath1 into the physical ( newtonian ) space - time @xmath25 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "a deformation history @xmath13 for which @xmath53 will be called * `` synchronized''*. the synchronization can practically performed for relatively slow deformation processes ( in comparison to sound wave velocity ) .    using the deformation @xmath45",
    ", we introduce the slicing of the material space - time @xmath1 by the level surfaces of the zeroth component of @xmath45 @xmath54    for a synchronized deformation @xmath55    there is a * time flow vector field * @xmath56 in @xmath1 , associated with the slicing @xmath14 of the space - time @xmath1 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this ( future directed ) vector field represent the flow of `` intrinsic '' ( proper in relativity theory ) time in the material . lifting the index in the 1-form @xmath57 with the help of the metric @xmath0 and normalizing obtained vector field ,",
    "we define the time flow vector field as @xmath58    the norm of the 1-form @xmath57 is defined as @xmath59 ( summation agreement by repeating indices is used here ) .",
    "thus , @xmath56 is the unit vector @xmath0-orthogonal to the slices @xmath14 . in the local coordinates @xmath60 , @xmath61    for the synchronized deformations does not depend on @xmath45 : @xmath62 additionally , if the metric @xmath0 has the block - diagonal form in the coordinates @xmath63 ( shortly , bd - metric ) , we have @xmath64^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial t}.$ ]    let @xmath65 be the flow vector associated with the metric @xmath41 and the corresponding 3d slicing @xmath66 .",
    "we require fulfillment of the following condition ensuring the irreversibility of the flow of time : @xmath67 deformation history @xmath45 for which the condition ( 2.5 ) is satisfied is called * admissible*.    in coordinates @xmath68 this condition reduces to the following simple inequality @xmath69 and , therefore is a restriction on the deformation history only .",
    "for a synchronized deformation history @xmath45 , this condition is trivially satisfied .",
    "time component @xmath70 of the deformation history may be excluded from the list of dynamical variables by an appropriate `` gauging '' .",
    "namely , we use the invariance of lagrangian under the automorphisms of the bundle @xmath71 to make the deformation history synchronized .",
    "an automorphism @xmath72 of the bundle @xmath71 determines the diffeomorphism of the base @xmath27 that can be considered as a change of variables @xmath73 .    in the new variables ,",
    "the condition ( 2.6 ) takes the form @xmath74 ( since @xmath75 do not depend on @xmath76 ) .",
    "thus , the class of admissible deformation histories @xmath45 is stable under the action of the subgroup @xmath77 of all automorphisms of @xmath1 with @xmath78 .",
    "the group @xmath77 of automorphisms of the bundle contains two subgroups .",
    "one is the subgroup @xmath79 of the `` time change '' proper gauge diffeomorphisms @xmath80 for an arbitrary smooth function @xmath81 with @xmath82 the other one ( denoted @xmath83 ) consists of the lifts to the slices @xmath14 of the manifold @xmath1 of the orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of the base @xmath27 ( group of such transformations of @xmath27 is denoted @xmath84 ) . to lift a diffeomorphism we use ( diffeomorphic ) projections @xmath85 .",
    "if @xmath45 is synchronized , lifted diffeomorphisms do not depend on @xmath50 .",
    "any automorphism of the bundle @xmath86 generates the time independent diffeomorphism @xmath87 of the base @xmath27 , that is element of @xmath88 lifting this element to the element of @xmath83 we represent the group @xmath77 as the semi - direct product of the normal subgroup @xmath89 and the subgroup @xmath83 .",
    "thus , we have proved the first of two following statements    1 .",
    "automorphisms group @xmath77 is the semidirect product of the subgroup @xmath90 of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of the base @xmath27 and the subgroup @xmath79 of proper gauge transformations @xmath91 of the fibers @xmath92 with @xmath82 2 .   for any admissible history of deformations",
    "@xmath13 one can choose a transformation @xmath93 such that the history of deformation @xmath94 is synchronized .    to prove the second statement",
    "let @xmath45 be an admissible history of deformation .",
    "define the element @xmath95 as follows : @xmath96 .",
    "then , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is another admissible history of deformation with the same components @xmath99 and the identity component @xmath100",
    ". transformation @xmath101 is admissible since @xmath102 , thus @xmath103 apparently , the deformation history @xmath98 is synchronized .",
    "therefore we may restrict our consideration to the synchronized histories of deformation keeping in mind that the covariance group of the theory reduces from the group @xmath77 to the group @xmath83 of time - independent orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of base @xmath27 .",
    "slicing @xmath14 , generates the ( 3,1)-decomposition of the material metric @xmath0 employed ( for a lorentz type metric ) in general relativity ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "specifically , the sandwich structure of the part of the manifold @xmath1 bounded by the surfaces @xmath14 and @xmath104 allows one to introduce the time - dependent lapse function @xmath105 and the shift vector field @xmath106 tangent to the slices @xmath14 such that the metric is block - diagonalized in the moving coframe @xmath107 : @xmath108    matrix representation of the material metric tensor @xmath0 and inverse tensor @xmath109 have in these notations , the forms @xmath110 where @xmath3 is the 3d - metric induced by @xmath0 on the slices @xmath14 and @xmath111 is the corresponding inverse tensor . in these notations",
    "@xmath112    in what follows we assume that the 4d - deformation history @xmath45 is synchronized .",
    "thus slices @xmath14 has the form @xmath113 .    in these notations ,",
    "the flow vector @xmath114 and the corresponding 1-form have the form @xmath115    the last formula gives the `` material time differential '' @xmath116 for the material metric @xmath0 . in our context , the coordinate x dependence of lapse function s(t , x ) accounts for heterogeneity of material aging in different points of the solid . on the fig .",
    "3 the local observer at different points of body at different moments of time @xmath50 sees the different rate of the local time in comparison with the laboratory clocks .",
    "moreover , the lapse function s can be considered as an intrinsic measure of material age , associated with its cohesiveness .",
    "it can be normalized to be equal 1 in the reference state of the solid . as a result of energy dissipation in various inelastic processes",
    ", material loses its cohesiveness with aging . in the formalism presented here",
    "it is manifested in slowing down of the material ( intrinsic ) time , i.e. increasing of @xmath117 .    here",
    "we do not consider thermodynamics .",
    "however , monotonic increase of @xmath117 resembles and can be linked to the principle of non - negative entropy production of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes : @xmath118    the requirement @xmath119 leads to the strong constraints on the form of the `` ground state term '' of the material lagrangian @xmath120 , ( see sec .",
    "5 ) .    in this context , the shift vector field @xmath106 in the metric @xmath0 reflects a propagation of the phase transition or chemical transformation boundary through the material as reflected , for instance in the mass conservation law ( see below ) .",
    "the separation of the evolution of 3d material metric @xmath3 , material transformation process in @xmath121 , characterized by @xmath106 and the inhomogeneity of the local time @xmath122 , are the main reason for introduction ( 3 + 1 ) adt - representation of 4d - metric in gravity theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , an adoption of this view leads to a very clear separation of the `` physical '' degrees of freedom in the canonical formalism and to the explicit hyperbolic formulations of einstein equations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the * mass form * @xmath123 defined in p is introduced here , in addition to the volume form @xmath124 of metric @xmath0 .",
    "the reference mass density @xmath125 , defined by this representation , satisfies the * mass conservation law * ( @xcite,@xcite ) @xmath126 here @xmath127 is the lie ( substantial ) derivative of the exterior 4-form @xmath128 in the direction of the vector field @xmath129 .",
    "recall that the lie derivative of a differential form @xmath130 along a vector filed @xmath131 is defined as @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the pullback of the form @xmath130 by the flow @xmath134 of the vector field @xmath131 ( @xcite ) .",
    "equation ( 3.1 ) is equivalent to the condition @xmath135 , where divergence is taken with respect to the volume form @xmath136 . in local coordinates the mass conservation law has the form @xmath137    due to the properties of the metric @xmath0 and the deformation @xmath45 , the material space - time manifold @xmath1 is foliated by the phase curves of the flow vector field @xmath56 and thus the value of the reference mass density @xmath138 at @xmath139 uniquely defines its values for all @xmath140 .    in the synchronized case @xmath141 and ( 3.2 )",
    "take the form of the following balance law @xmath142 from ( 3.3 ) we note that the shift vector field @xmath106 can describe the * matter ( density ) flow due to the some internal processes * such as the phase or chemical transformations .    if , in addition to being synchronized , the material metric @xmath0 is also in the bd - form ( @xmath143 ) , the flow term in ( 3.3 ) disappears and the mass conservation law is equivalent to the following representation of the reference mass density in terms of its initial value @xmath144 : @xmath145 where @xmath146 is assumed to be euclidean metric .",
    "if metric @xmath0 does not changes with time @xmath50 , we get the classical local mass conservation law @xmath147",
    "in this section we introduce the principal quantities characterizing both elastic and inelastic deformation processes .",
    "total deformation is presented as a composition of elastic and inelastic ones and is integrable .",
    "its elastic and inelastic `` components '' are non - integrable , in general , but might be such in special situations ( see sec.11 ) .",
    "we recall that the presentation of total deformation as a composition of this type was studied in different forms in many works ( @xcite , to name a few ) .",
    "what is new here is the 4d - approach to this decomposition and direct definition of elastic , inelastic and total strain tensors in terms of material metric @xmath148 as an independent dynamical variable , reference ( undeformed ) cauchy metric @xmath149 and the current cauchy metric @xmath150 rather then using the `` deformation gradients '' ( integrable or not ) of elastic and inelastic ( plastic ) deformations .",

    "consider a thin ring ( see figure 7 ) which represent the 2d cross - section of the tubing .",
    "the wall thickness @xmath413 is small in comparison to the outer radius @xmath414 : @xmath415 . @xmath416 in fig * * stands for the radius of interface between the layer of degraded material and unchanged layer .",
    "the depth of degradation @xmath417 is relatively small : @xmath418 .",
    "select the polar coordinate system @xmath419 .",
    "2d material metrics of the initial ( @xmath420 ) and degraded ( @xmath421 ) states are @xmath422 where @xmath423 and @xmath424 is a small variation of scale in the radial direction .",
    "mass conservation law @xmath425 relates density variation @xmath426 with the change in material metric = = ( 1+)^3/2 1 - 1++o(^2 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath427    thus , the densification ( i.e. @xmath428 ) leads to the shrinkage of the thin ring of degraded material .",
    "if we remove the constrains on shrinkage applied by the outer ring of original material the gap w = r_d^0-(1-)r^0_d= r^0_d appears .    as a result of such constrains , the degraded material should be elastically stretched to close the gap @xmath429 .",
    "this elastic deformation has the form @xmath430 under such a deformation elastic strain tensor @xmath431 has the form e^el    1 & 0 + 0 & 1    .",
    "the tensile strain ( 8.9 ) is directly translated into the tensile radial stress via hooke s law @xmath432 although hoop stresses @xmath433 may be discontinuous , the equilibrium conditions requires continuity of radial stress across the interface , , @xmath434 this implies that the outer ring of original material experiences compressive stresses while the inner degraded layer is under tension .",
    "the elastic strains @xmath181 jointly close the gap @xmath429 and restore the compatibility of the cauchy metric @xmath435 in the whole domain : @xmath436 therefore while the material metric @xmath421 has the jump leading to the nonzero singular curvature along the interface , the final metric is continuous and flat .",
    "as it is typical for a lagrangian field theory , action of any one - parameter group of transformations of the space @xmath437 , commuting with the projection to @xmath1 , leads to the corresponding balance law ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , translations in the `` physical '' space - time @xmath25 lead to the dynamical equations ( 7.1 - 2 ) , rotations in @xmath25 lead to the angular momentum balance law ( conservation law in the absence of applied torque ) . respectively , translations in the `` material space - time '' @xmath1 lead to the * energy balance law * ( translations along the time @xmath50 axis ) and to the * material momentum balance law * ( `` pseudomomentum '' balance , ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , rotations in the material space @xmath27 lead to the `` material angular momentum '' balance law ( @xcite ) .    in the table below we present basic balance laws together with the transformations generating them .",
    "it is instructive to compare the space and material balance laws as it has been considered previously by several authors ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    ".space and material balance laws [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this work , we consider the intrinsic material metric tensor to be an additional parameter of state , i.e. , an internal variable that characterizes material degradation and aging .",
    "the material metric tensor @xmath0 is a conjugate ( with respect to a particular lagrangian ) to the canonical energy - momentum tensor ( or to the eshelby energy - stress tensor to some degree ) .",
    "equations of metric evolution , ( i.e. , the aging equations ) , are derived as the euler - lagrange equation of a corresponding variational problem .",
    "canonical energy - momentum tensor ( or eshelby tensor ) play a role of the source of metric evolution .",
    "this represents an alternative approach to numerous phenomenological damage models , which usually have more adjustable parameters than practical testing is able to determine .",
    "thus it is difficult to validate the models since they can almost always be adjusted to reach an agreement with the experiment .",
    "in contrast , a variational approach prescribes a functional form of the aging equations , limits the number of constants ( adjustable parameters ) employed in the lagrangian , provides a simple physical interpretation of the constants , and admits an essential experimental examination of the validity of the basic assumptions of the model .",
    "particular examples ( aging homogeneous rod , see sec . 11 or [ 20 ] ,",
    "cold drawing ( necking ) [ 18 ] , residual stress and others ) can be analyzed theoretically and unambiguously tested in the experiments as a natural continuation of the present work .",
    "a natural development of this scheme requires the following : thermodynamical interpretation of the balance equation considered in section 10 , especially the structural entropy evolution manifested by the increase of the lapse function @xmath438 during aging ; introduction of a temperature dependence of the material metric ( based on an unpublished work by a.chudnovsky and b.kunin ) ; development of models ( `` ground energy '' @xmath101 + kinetic potential @xmath439 + possibly other metrical terms ) characterizing a hierarchy of aging phenomena for specific materials ; and especially , the development of models of phase transition ( front propagation , fractal restructuring of materials , etc . ) .",
    "we would like to express our gratitude to professor m. francaviglia for his attention to this work .",
    "we would also like to thank professor r.tucker and the participants of his seminar in the physics department of lancaster university , uk for the useful discussion .",
