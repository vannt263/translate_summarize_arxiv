    "quasi - normal mode ( qnm ) is one of the important and exciting themes in the black hole physics .",
    "qnms represent the behaviours of fields on a black hole spacetime under a certain condition , imposed both at the event horizon of the black hole and at the asymptotic infinity of the spacetime .",
    "this means that qnms can be strongly affected by the curvature of the spacetime . in other words",
    ", we can expect that the property of qnms strongly reflects the property of the spacetime , and so we can grasp the property of the spacetime by studying on qnms .",
    "the existence of qnms was mentioned first by vishveshwara@xcite in the context of scattering problem by black holes .",
    "later , people began to perceive that qnms were important sources of gravitational waves , and many researchers developed various methods to calculate qnm frequencies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , some researchers have pointed out that the asymptotic behaviour of the distribution of qnms relates to the quantum gravitational theory @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , we recognise that researches on properties of qnms will further increase its importance .",
    "our motivation of this article is to study properties of a black hole spacetime using qnms as a mathematical tool .",
    "almost all studies on qnms discuss only massless fields such as electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves , since these studies mainly focuses on phenomenological significances .",
    "therefore , there are few studies on qnms by massive fields ( hereafter , we call them massive qnms ) .",
    "one of the studies related to massive qnms is a work by simone and will @xcite , which investigates massive qnms on black hole spacetime using wkb method .",
    "they study the dependency of qnm frequencies on the mass of the field , but their discussion is restricted to narrow range of the field mass due to the restriction required by the wkb method .",
    "hence , their analysis can not fully reveal the dependency of qnm frequencies on the field mass .",
    "another work on massive qnm is a study by konoplya @xcite .",
    "he study massive qnms on a charged black hole back ground and consider qnms due to massive and charged fields .",
    "his paper mainly focuses on correlation between qnms and the charge of the field and the black hole .",
    "therefore , the dependency of qnms on the field mass is not argued , though his article investigate almost same situation that we will study in this article .",
    "hence , we will study behaviours of qnms to the field mass in detail .",
    "for this purpose , we first consider a model in which we can derive qnm frequencies analytically . through this investigation",
    "we find that there is a singular phenomenon that qnms may disappear when the field mass becomes sufficiently large .",
    "second , we study qnms on the reisner - nordstrm black hole spacetime by a numerical method . as a result",
    ", we confirmed that the singular phenomenon observed in the model can also be observed in the real black hole case .",
    "this article consists of the following contents . in",
    ", we study a correlation between qnm frequencies and the field mass in a model which can be solved analytically . in , we examine the real black hole case with a numerical method . in",
    ", we discuss the result obtained in . in , we summarise our investigation .",
    "additionally , [ sec : leaver ] shows the review of the calculation algorithm used in .",
    "in this section , we study the dependence of massive qnm frequencies on the field mass by using an analytically solvable model .    generally , in order for qnms to exist , it is necessary that the background has a potential that can trap waves .",
    "then , the trapped waves will exude out gradually .",
    "this phenomenon is exactly qnms .",
    "if the asymptotic values of the potential are the same at both side of the potential peak , the waves will be the massless qnms .",
    "if the asymptotic values are different , they will be massive qnms .",

    "it is normalised by @xmath6.,height=226 ]     profiles of the potential ( [ eq : bhpot ] ) in a schwarzschild black hole case ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "it is normalised by @xmath6.,height=226 ]    this model can be solved analytically as follows .",
    "first , by changing the coordinate @xmath4 to @xmath7 , can be rewritten into the following form , @xmath8z(u)=0.\\ ] ] note that the infinity of @xmath9 corresponds to @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "these two points @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the regular singularities of the differential equation .",
    "then , the behaviour of @xmath14 around these two singularities is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , by setting @xmath18 and substituting into , we obtain a differential equation for @xmath19 as follows , @xmath20g(u)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is exactly the hyper - geometric equation and the solution of this equation can be given by the hyper - geometric function @xmath21 . in consequence , we find the solution of as follows , @xmath22    now , let us give our attention to the following relation@xcite , @xmath23 according to , we can analytically determine qnm frequencies from the behaviour of the solution around @xmath12 and @xmath13 , because qnm is defined by the boundary conditions at @xmath9 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the boundary condition is that : qnms are    1 .   ingoing waves at @xmath24 ( @xmath12 ) , 2",
    "outgoing waves at @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , and 3 .   damping modes . ]    from the first condition at @xmath12 , we have to choose the sign of @xmath27 as , @xmath28 the second condition at @xmath26 means @xmath29 because @xmath30 represents the incoming waves at @xmath26 when we set @xmath31 .",
    "is @xmath32 . ] therefore , qnm frequencies can be determined by , @xmath33 according to . by solving this equation for @xmath34",
    ", we obtain @xmath35 where we set @xmath36 and @xmath37 . when @xmath38 , @xmath34 is pure imaginary .",
    "however , @xmath34 becomes a complex number if @xmath39 .",
    "in this case , the first term in the right hand side of represents the damping part and the second term does the oscillation part .",
    "consequently , the damping coefficient of qnms approaches to zero as a quadratic function of @xmath40 . however , @xmath34 never becomes a real number because the branch of square root changes discontinuously when qnm frequencies get across the real axis . according to this result ,",
    "we can conclude that there exist qnms with arbitrarily long decaying time when @xmath2 changes appropriately .",
    "in other words , we find an interesting fact that there is a kind of resonance mode in a limiting situation and qnms can disappear when @xmath2 exceeds a certain value .",
    "this disappearance is due to the relation of the height of the peak of the potential with the field mass .",
    "therefore , we can expect that the same phenomenon will occur in the black hole case .",
    "thus , we will investigate the massive qnms on the black hole spacetime in the next section .",
    "in this section , we consider qnms of a massive scalar field on a spherical black hole spacetime . in the black hole case , we must tackle the problem in a numerical way because it is difficult to study it fully analytically .",
    "the metric of a spherical symmetric spacetime is given by @xmath41 in this article , we consider the reisner - nordstrm black hole as the back ground spacetime , so the metric function @xmath42 is given by : @xmath43 where @xmath1 is the black hole mass and @xmath44 is the black hole charge .",
    "we also introduce the normalised variables @xmath45 and @xmath46 as below , @xmath47 respectively .    in this spacetime , the radial equation for a scalar field in term of the normalised variables",
    "is given by @xmath48z(x)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath40 are normalised frequency and mass of the scalar field and they are related to original frequency @xmath49 and mass @xmath2 , and @xmath49 is introduced by variable separation , @xmath50 . ] by @xmath51 respectively .",

    "the profiles of this potential in some cases are shown in and .",
    "figure [ caption : potb ] in also shows the potential for comparison with the potential of the analytic model .    in order to calculate the qnm frequencies , we solve numerically .",
    "we consider the case of @xmath57 in this article , because the mathematical structure of with @xmath58 is apparently different from the case of @xmath57 .",
    "the reason of excluding the case of @xmath59 is that there is no horizon in this case and then the central singularity is naked . in this case , qnms can not be defined .",
    "although the schwarzschild case , @xmath60 , seems to be different case , we verify that there is no difference between the two cases in our results : ( i ) @xmath60 and ( ii ) @xmath61 .    the numerical method which we use in calculating qnm frequencies",
    "is the continued fraction method developed by leaver@xcite . in [ sec : leaver ] , we will briefly review this method for our case . in this article , we examine only @xmath62 and calculate qnm frequencies from @xmath63 to around @xmath64 in several cases of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the results are shown in , , and . in these figures ,",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 mean the imaginary and real part of the qnm frequencies , respectively .",

    "it is obvious from the figures that the imaginary part of the qnms on the black hole spacetime approaches to @xmath75 as well as the analytical model in the last section .",
    "this tendency is more clear in figure [ caption : reqnm3 ] .",
    "figure [ caption : reqnm3 ] shows the trajectories of the qnm frequencies on the @xmath34-plane when the field mass @xmath40 changes while keeping @xmath46 constant . from this figure",
    ", we can find that the trajectories of the qnm frequencies are almost linear , and we can guess the frequencies when qnms disappear .",
    "we call the modes with these _ real _ frequencies as _ quasi - resonance modes ( qrm)_. according to the linearity of the qnm trajectories , we can calculate the dependence of qrm frequencies on the field mass @xmath40 with the following fitting function , @xmath76 the behaviour of this @xmath77 to @xmath40 is plotted in .",
    "we will give more detailed discussion on our results in the next section .",
    "in this article , we have studied massive qnms for the two cases , the analytically solvable model and the black hole .",
    "we can find the same phenomenon , that the life of qnms becomes longer as the field mass increases , in both cases .",
    "from this fact , we can conclude that there exists a qnm , oscillating without damping for an arbitrary period .",
    "this extreme mode may be regarded as a kind of resonance mode ( after this fact , we named this mode _ quasi - resonance mode , qrm _ , in the last section ) .",
    "now , we propose a physical picture of the disappearance of qnm and the existence of qrms .",
    "first , let us discuss the case of the analytic model .",
    "we consider only @xmath78 case for simplicity . by setting @xmath78 in",
    ", we obtain @xmath79",
    "what is noticed from is that qnm frequencies are almost determined by the width @xmath3 of the potential peak when @xmath80 , and they turn out to depend on @xmath81 as @xmath40 increases .",
    "since the energy of qnms is proportional to the real part of @xmath34 , the larger the energy of qnms is , the gentler the peak of the potential becomes .",
    "then the peak will vanish at @xmath82 . according to the wkb analysis of qnm by schutz and",
    "will @xcite , qnms can be regarded as the waves trapped by the peak of the potential .",
    "therefore , in their picture , vanishing of the peak is equivalent to the potential being unable to trap any waves .",
    "this means that qnms disappear .",
    "fitting by a parabola @xmath83 .",
    "the solid line shows the qnm trajectory of @xmath60 and the dashing line shows the fitting curve.,height=226 ]    next , let us consider the black hole case in this picture . in the black hole case , the peak of the potential vanishes at , for example , @xmath84 for @xmath60 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 . on the other hand , and indicate disappearance of qnms approximately at @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the above picture seems to be realized approximately .",
    "because the qnm frequencies are _ complex numbers _ , it is unreasonable to think that the disappearance of qnms perfectly coincides with vanishing of the peak of the _ real _ potential in general .",
    "hence , it is natural to consider that the coincidence in the analytic model is accidental .",
    "however , the behaviours of qnms to @xmath2 in both cases resemble each other very well . figure [ caption : fitting ]",
    "shows that the trajectory of qnms can be fitted by a parabola very well .",
    "that is , our analytic model imitates the black hole case precisely .",
    "therefore , since the analytic model predicts the disappearance of qnms , it is undeniable that there exist qrms in the case of black hole as well as the case of analytic model , and that qnms will disappear as the field mass exceed a certain value .",
    "we also examine the effect of the black hole charge .",
    "we can see the behaviours of qnms and qrms when we change the black hole charge , @xmath46 , in and .",
    "these figures indicate that qnm and qrm frequencies tend to get larger when @xmath46 increases .",
    "this can be explained by the potential profiles . according to and [ caption : potm03 ] ,",
    "when @xmath46 increases , the peak of the potential becomes higher and the value of @xmath40 at vanishing point of the peak becomes larger .",
    "consequently , qnms can exist at larger @xmath40 and qrm frequencies get higher . these facts ,",
    "too , support our picture of the disappearance of qnms .",
    "let us summarise our results .",
    "first , we studied massive qnms in the analytical model , and derived qnm frequencies analytically . by this analysis , we found that qnms will disappear when the field mass increases and exceeds a certain value .",
    "secondly , we examined the dependence of qnm frequencies on the field mass by numerical method in the case of black hole .",
    "there , we again found the disappearance of qnms as we did in the analytic model case .",
    "we also studied the dependence of qnm frequencies on the charge of the black hole . based on these examinations",
    ", we proposed a picture about the disappearance of qnms .",
    "in the appendix , we briefly review the continued fraction method , which is first developed by leaver@xcite .",
    "first , let @xmath88 be the solution of @xmath89 in .",
    "then , the points @xmath90 are regular singularities and the point @xmath91 is an irregular singularity of the differential equation .",
    "note also that @xmath92 corresponds to the inner horizon of the black hole and @xmath93 corresponds to the outer horizon .",
    "qnms on a reisner - nordstrm black hole spacetime exist in regions connected to the spatial infinity of the spacetime .",
    "these regions are shown as a , a in the conformal diagram ( ) .",
    "therefore , the boundary conditions for qnms on this spacetime are imposed at @xmath93 and at @xmath91 .",
