    "the debye shielding of a charge immersed in a flowing plasma is an old classic problem , which received considerable attention  @xcite , with applications ranging from charging of a spacecraft in the ionosphere  @xcite to spectra of ions moving through solids  @xcite .",
    "various forms of the potential distribution were obtained , depending on model assumptions and parameter values .",

    "much theoretical effort  @xcite has been made to describe how the charged dust particles are shielded in that region , as the shielding directly determines their mutual electrostatic interaction .",

    "there have also been measurements of the interaction between dust particles  @xcite , but it is difficult to judge on the accuracy of wake models because of experimental uncertainties , limited measurement range of distances , and poorly known parameters in the levitation region ( see , e.g. , figs .",

    "while theoretical and simulation efforts to describe the wakes generated by dust particles have been focused on the homogeneous plasma approximation , the levitation region is usually considerably inhomogeneous , as evidenced by measurements of the resonance frequency of vertical oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the measured frequency @xmath2 yields the field inhomogeneity length @xmath3 ( with the ion drag force  @xcite and dust charge variations  @xcite being neglected ) , which turns out to be about the characteristic shielding length in the region ( see , e.g. , sec .",

    "to draw conclusions , let us first discuss the relevance of our model to experiments with complex plasmas .",
    "\\(i ) the sheath is meant to be only a part of the plasma - wall transition layer separating an isotropic plasma from an electrode  @xcite .",
    "it is often unclear whether the dust particles in a given experiment are levitated in the sheath , presheath , or at the boundary between the two .",
    "an estimate of the electron - to - ion density ratio at the levitation position for a typical experiment  @xcite , based on poisson s equation and the measured resonance frequency of vertical particle oscillations , yields @xmath105  @xcite , suggesting that particles were levitated near the boundary .",
    "sufficiently heavy particles , especially under hypergravity conditions  @xcite , may be levitated in the sheath .",
    "it is noteworthy that while the bohm sheath model represents a dc regime , most dusty plasma experiments are performed in rf discharges , where electrons respond to the rf field .",
    "it is thus clear that the bohm sheath is not a precise model to describe the levitation region for most experiments .",
    "however , to qualitatively appreciate the effect of the inhomogeneity on the wake , we only need a self - consistent plasma profile that roughly resembles the actual one , and the bohm sheath model is certainly adequate for such a purpose .",
    "\\(ii ) ions in the levitation region are generally not cold , as they experience collisions on their way through the presheath , forming a velocity distribution with a suprathermal width  @xcite .",
    "the latter should affect the shielding , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ effects - of - the - inhomogeneity ] in the context of the results of this paper  but , again , to specifically identify the role of the inhomogeneity , it seems reasonable to start with the assumption of cold ions .",
    "moreover , measurements of the ion velocity distribution at the electrode show that depending on the pressure and rf power , the characteristic width of the distribution can be considerably smaller than the flow velocity  @xcite , making the cold ion approximation quite reasonable for a certain range of distances from the electrode .",
    "\\(iii ) a necessary condition for the model of the collisionless bohm sheath to be applicable is that the ion - neutral collision length must be much larger than the electron debye length  @xcite . for a typical experiment performed at 2.7 pa  @xcite ,",
    "their ratio is @xmath106  @xcite .",
    "hence , the collisionless approximation should be quite reasonable for experiments performed at lower pressures  @xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) we use the linear perturbation approximation .",
    "nonlinear effects can indeed be substantial for experiments in which dust particles are levitated in a more or less isotropic region .",
    "however , for ion flow velocities of the order of the bohm velocity , nonlinear effects should be insignificant as the coulomb radii for ions and electrons , defined as @xmath107 are usually much smaller than the debye lengths @xmath108 [ defined by eq .",
    "( [ ion - shielding - length ] ) ] . nevertheless , accounting for the presence of low - energy ions due to ion - neutral collisions may still affect the results to some extent  @xcite .",
    "\\(v ) the assumption of boltzmann electrons becomes invalid near the wall because of the absorption .",
    "however , our model is fully self - consistent as we assume the wall to be located sufficiently far from the charge . in experiments with complex plasmas in rf discharges ,",
    "the levitation height above the electrode is usually quite large , e.g. , an order of magnitude larger than the electron debye length  @xcite .",
    "\\(vi ) finally , we assume a non - absorbing point charge .",
    "the absorption should be generally insignificant for flow velocities of the order of the bohm velocity because in this regime @xmath108 are typically two orders of magnitude larger than the ion and electron collection radii ( impact parameters )  @xcite .",
    "the assumption of a point charge is justified for the same reason  the dust size is typically two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath108 .",
    "now that the relevance of our model has been discussed , let us elaborate on our findings .",
    "the first effect is the disappearance of the oscillatory wake structure .",
    "we note that the presence of these oscillations within the assumption of a homogeneous plasma is model - dependent .",
    "for instance , the number of oscillations is infinite for cold ions and boltzmann electrons but becomes finite when the ion distribution is a shifted maxwellian ( in which case the far - field potential exhibits a monotonic @xmath0-decay  @xcite ) . in the latter model , the number of the oscillations is determined by the flow - to - thermal velocity ratio as well as the ratio of the temperatures .",
    "when the first ratio does not exceed a certain value of the order of unity , the wake exhibits a single potential well , at least when the electron - to - ion temperature ratio is infinitely large  @xcite .",
    "hence , a homogeneous model with a realistic ion velocity distribution ( whose characteristic width is comparable to the ion flow velocity  @xcite ) may also yield a non - oscillatory wake .",
    "the issue is complicated by a non - maxwellian form of the ion velocity distribution , ion - neutral collisions , and the electric field . a model accounting for all these factors can still yield an oscillatory wake , as follows from eq .",
    "( 6 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present study suggests that the inhomogeneity tends to suppress the oscillations .",
    "since the inhomogeneity is usually significant in experiments ( as noted in sec .",
    "[ introduction ] and discussed in sec .",
    "[ implications ] ) , one can expect the wake oscillations unlikely to be formed in most experiments , regardless of what homogeneous models predict .    to shed a light on how the oscillations are suppressed by the inhomogeneity ,",
    "let us focus on the large-@xmath8 behavior of the fourier - transformed ( over @xmath56 ) potential perturbation , considering the case @xmath109 for simplicity .",
    "this behavior is described by @xmath110 as follows from eq .",
    "( [ final - equation ] ) .",
    "this has a form of the oscillator equation with a variable frequency .",
    "the latter is determined by the unperturbed ion profile [ eqs .",
    "( [ velocity - density - unperturbed ] ) and ( [ potential - unperturbed ] ) ] , while the electrons do not contribute , as the boltzmann factor @xmath111 becomes exponentially small at large @xmath8 . obviously",
    ", if @xmath112 is considered to be constant , eq .",
    "( [ oscillations ] ) yields an oscillatory structure of @xmath113 .",
    "for the collisionless bohm sheath , at large @xmath8 we have @xmath114 ( plus the higher - order terms ) , as follows from eqs .",
    "( [ velocity - density - unperturbed ] ) and ( [ potential - unperturbed ] ) . for this dependence , the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ oscillations ] ) becomes non - oscillatory , @xmath115 , indicating that the inhomogeneity tends to inhibit wake oscillations .",
    "the second effect is that the wake becomes considerably weaker , i.e. , @xmath7 dips to a less negative value ( see fig .",
    "[ along ] ) .",
    "this effect is not obvious . on the one hand , in comparison to the homogeneous case ,",
    "the plasma at @xmath93 ( where the wake is formed ) has smaller ion and electron densities and a larger flow velocity and thus may be considered as less capable of considerable `` overshielding '' , so one could indeed expect a weaker wake .",
    "but on the other hand , the ion deflection starts long before the ions reach the plane @xmath17 . at this level",
    "they already have a transverse velocity , which could be larger in the inhomogeneous model ( because at @xmath97 the ions are slower and thus more prone to the deflection than in the homogeneous case ) , resulting in a larger transverse displacement and hence a stronger wake .",
    "our results imply that the former contribution is stronger than the latter one .",
    "yet another effect is a substantially weaker screening of the coulomb potential in the perpendicular direction ( for a sufficiently strong inhomogeneity ) .",
    "note that for very large @xmath55 , the homogeneous model predicts a long - range attraction ( for a charge of the same sign ) in this direction  @xcite . in our inhomogeneous model",
    "the attraction has not been found , although we did not study the regime of unrealistically large @xmath55 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "also note that such an attraction was obtained , for a certain set of parameter values , in the study of ref .",
    "@xcite including the inhomogeneity along with ion - neutral collisions , ionization , and close proximity of the wall .",
    "since we found the inhomogeneity to weaken the screening in the perpendicular direction , we suggest that it generally weakens ( or eliminates , depending on conditions ) the attraction in this direction .    on the other hand ,",
    "some wake parameters are practically unaffected by the inhomogeneity , for instance , the location of the wake focus ( i.e. , of the minimum of the wake potential ) .",
    "the same applies to the ion drag force @xmath117 ( which is the electric force exerted by the point charge @xmath10 on itself through the plasma perturbation ) .",
    "indeed , the ion drag force can be written in the dimensionless variables by using eq .",
    "( [ inverse - transform - final ] ) as @xmath118 where we avoid the well - known logarithmic divergence of the ion drag force  @xcite by classically truncating the integration at @xmath119 ( where nonlinear effects become significant ) . here",

    "( [ coulomb - radii ] ) and normalized by @xmath121 , the ion drag force @xmath122 is normalized by @xmath123 , and @xmath124 is an infinitesimal negative number . since the normalized @xmath125 is usually very large ( which is the condition to employ the linear perturbation approximation ) ,",
    "the ion drag force is primarily determined by the coefficient of the @xmath126-dependence of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ ion - drag - integral ] ) ( at large @xmath95 ) .",
    "we have found this coefficient to be _ exactly _ the same for the inhomogeneous and homogeneous models , which reflects the obvious fact that the plasma inhomogeneity is negligible at small spatial scales ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "a natural question arises as to what extent the approximation of a homogeneous plasma is accurate to describe wakes in experiments with complex plasmas . obviously , the levitation position and hence the local magnitude of the inhomogeneity depend on the particle size , so let us make some estimates .",

    "the value of @xmath55 is lower , reaching @xmath146 at @xmath147  @xmath144 m , which is a typical dust radius for experiments . at this point",
    "the inhomogeneity still affects the wake considerably ( see fig .",
    "[ along ] ) , so the dust size must be substantially further reduced for the homogeneous approximation to become accurate .",
    "note that much smaller ( sub - micron ) particles should rather be levitated in the presheath , where eqs .",
    "( [ vertical - balance ] ) and ( [ charging ] ) are inappropriate .    to estimate the role of the ion drag , we use the following expression : @xmath148 where the pre - logarithmic factor is the coefficient of the @xmath126-dependence of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ ion - drag - integral ] ) at large @xmath95 ( written in the dimensional variables ) , the coulomb logarithm is taken to be @xmath149 and the subscript `` 0 '' is used to explicitly refer to the particle location . by using eq .",

    "since this ratio decreases with @xmath55 , the ion drag should not considerably affect the vertical force balance unless the particle is rather small .",

    "the velocity inhomogeneity length @xmath88 must be at least an order of magnitude larger than @xmath91 ( the length characterizing the collective ion response ) in order for the inhomogeneity to not affect the wake considerably ( see fig .",
    "[ along ] in conjunction with fig .",
    "[ inhomogeneity ] ) .    by modifying the wakes",
    ", the plasma inhomogeneity affects a variety of static and dynamic dust structures .",
    "for instance , the inhomogeneity effect on the derivative @xmath152 ( see fig .  [ dphidz ] ) should influence the development of the mode - coupling instability in two - dimensional plasma crystals  @xcite : the growth rate of the instability is proportional to the square of the above derivative  @xcite , so that the critical pressure ( at which the instability is suppressed by the gas friction ) dramatically depends on the inhomogeneity .",
    "furthermore , the weakening of the wake should affect the stability of vertical dust pairs  @xcite , while the weakening of the screening in the perpendicular direction implies substantially stronger interparticle interactions in two - dimensional plasma crystals .",
    "yet another implication is that since the inhomogeneity tends to suppress the long - range attraction in the perpendicular direction ( for a charge of the same sign ) , it may be very difficult to experimentally realize a molecular - type interaction potential in two - dimensional plasma crystals .",

    "a difficulty arises at this point : it turns out that even a tiny relative difference between the `` upper '' and `` lower '' values of @xmath180 obtained by the above bisection method results in a strong deviation between the corresponding `` upper '' and `` lower '' curves @xmath161 , which occurs already at quite small positive @xmath8 ( unless @xmath95 is not small enough ) .",

    "we stop the bisection procedure as soon as the difference between the `` upper '' and `` lower '' values of @xmath180 becomes smaller than a certain threshold @xmath186 , and then integrate the system  ( [ system ] ) to the point of the @xmath8 axis at which the deviation between the corresponding `` upper '' and `` lower '' curves @xmath161 exceeds another threshold @xmath187 . the next step is to reduce the uncertainty of @xmath113 at this point to @xmath186 .",
