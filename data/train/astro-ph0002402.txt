    "clearly , the high energy @xmath0-ray emission is an important piece in the blazar puzzle because the @xmath0-ray observations of blazars provide a new probe of dense radiation field released through accretion onto a supermassive black hole in the central engine ( bregman 1990 ) .",
    "the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( _ egret _ ) which works in the 0.110gev energy domain has now detected and identified 66 extragalactic sources in 3th catalog ( mukherjee et al 1999 ) .",
    "all these objects are blazar - type agns whose relativistic jets are assumed to be close to the line of sight to the observer . it seems unambiguous that the intense gamma - ray emission is related with highly relativistic jet .",
    "it has been generally accepted that the luminous gamma - ray emission is radiated from inverse compton , but the problem of seed photons remains open for debate .",
    "the following arguments have been proposed : ( 1 ) synchrotron photons in jet ( inhomogeneous model of synchrotron self compton ) ( maraschi , ghisellini & celotti 1992 ) ; ( 2 ) optical and ultraviolet photons directly from the accretion disk ( dermer & schlikeiser 1993 ) ; ( 3 ) diffusive photons in broad line region ( blr ) ( sikora , begelman & rees 1994 , blandford & levinson 1995 ) ; ( 4 ) the reflected synchrotron photons by electron mirror in broad line region , namely , the reflected synchrotron inverse compton ( rsc ) ( ghisellini & madau 1996 ) . these mechanisms may operate in different kinds of objects , however there is not yet a consensus on how these mechanisms work . also it is not clear where the @xmath0-ray emission is taking place largely because of uncertainties of soft radiation field in the central engine .    on the other hand , vhe observations ( kerrick et al 1995 ,",
    "chadwick et al 1999 , roberts et al 1999 , aharonian et al 1999 ) are making attempts to explore the radiation mechanism because they may provide some restrictive constraints ( begelman , rees & sikora 1994 , mastichiadis & kirk 1997 , tavecchio , maraschi & ghisellini 1998 , coppi & aharonian 1999 , harwit , protheroe and biermann 1999 ) .",
    "based on the simple version of ssc model , stecker , de jager & salamon ( 1996 ) predicted a large number of low redshift x - ray selected bl lacs as tev candidates , taking into account that the presence of intergalactic infrared radiation field including cosmic background leads to strong absorption of tev photons from cosmological emitters ( stecker & de jager 1998 ) .",
    "it is suggested to form an extended pair halo in cosmological distance due to the _ external _ absorption ( aharonian , coppi , & voelk 1994 ) .",
    "however , so far only three x - ray selected bl lacs have been found to be tev emitters by whipple telescope ( @xmath2gev ) , in addition , photons higher than 0.3tev in the x - ray - selected pks 2155 - 304 with redshift @xmath3 has been detected photons 0.3tev by durham mrk 6 telescope ( chadwick et al 1999 ) .",
    "the recent measurements of intergalactic infrared field is quite different from the previous observations ( madau et al 1998 , steidel 1998 ) .",
    "although this _ external _ absorption is definitely important , the critical redshift @xmath4 beyond which cosmological back ground radiation and intergalactic infrared fields will absorb vhe photons remains uncertain .",
    "especially the recent vhe observations show that mrk 501 emits 25 tev photons ( aharonian et al 1999 ) .",
    "evidently this suggests that the _ external _ absorption can not efficiently attenuate the vhe photons from reaching us across distances of 100 mpc .",
    "it is highly desired to accurately probe the star formation rate in order to determine the critical redshift @xmath4 .",
    "thus it seems significant to study the _ intrinsic _ mechanism for the deficiency of tev photons from @xmath5-ray loud agns disregarding the absorption by intergalactic infrared radiation field",
    ". a larger lorentz factor of the jet implies higher density of the external photons in the blob , if the reflection of clouds in broad line region works , and therefore stronger absorption of high energy @xmath5-rays ( celotti , fabian & rees 1998 ) .",
    "here we argue based on the hypothesis of ghisellini & madau ( 1996 ) that the energy density of reflected synchrotron photon is high enough for pair production via interaction of gamma - ray photons by inverse compton scattering with reflected synchrotron photons if the bulk velocity is high enough .",
    "further we apply the present constraint to the representative individual objects , mrk 421 and 3c 279 .",
    "ghisellini & madau ( 1996 ) have calculated the energy density of reflected synchrotron ( rsy ) emission , and compared with the other reflected components .",
    "they draw a conclusion that the energy density of rsy component dominates over 10 times of that of reflected component of accretion disk radiation . in this section",
    "we make an attempt to use the observables quantities to express the intrinsic constraints on very high energy emission .",
    "the overall @xmath6 spectrum of blazars shows that there are two power peaks : the first is low energy one between ir / soft x - ray band , and the second is high energy one peaking in the mev / gev range ( von montigny et al 1995 , sambruna , maraschi & urry 1996 , comastri et al 1997 , kubo et al 1998 ) .",
    "this characteristic can be explained by the simple context of one - zone homogeneous ssc or ec model .",
    "the low energy peak denoted @xmath7 is caused by synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons , and the second peak denoted @xmath8 , or @xmath9 results from the compton scattering off the synchrotron or reflected synchrotron photons by the same population of electrons , respectively .",
    "we take the two peaks and their corresponding fluxes as four observable quantities .    from the rsc model",
    "the magnetic field @xmath10 can be approximately expressed by the observational quantities .",
    "the observed frequency of synchrotron photon is @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , and the frequency of reflected synchrotron compton photons reads @xmath13 , and we can get the estimation of magnetic field @xmath10 @xmath14 while in pure ssc model the magnetic field is approximately as @xmath15 , where @xmath8 is the frequency of photons emitted by ssc . the doppler factor @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 is the cosine of the orientated angle of jet relative to the observer .",
    "equation ( 1 ) is similar to the model of sikora , begelman & rees ( 1994 ) ( also see sambruna , maraschi & urry 1996 ) . comparing with the above two formula",
    ", we learn that rsc model needs stronger magnetic field than ssc model does whereas the energy of relativistic electrons is lower in rsc model than in ssc model . the reflected synchrotron compton ( rsc )",
    "mainly depends on two parameters : the reflection albedo , namely , the thomson scattering optical depth ( @xmath18 ) , and the lorentz factor @xmath19 of the relativistic jet .      in the case of power - law distribution of electrons ,",
    "@xmath20 , ( @xmath21 ) , where @xmath22 is the number density of relativistic electrons , and @xmath0 is the lorentz factor of electron , the synchrotron emission coefficiency is approximately given by @xmath23 .",
    "here @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is tabulated in pacholczyk ( 1970 ) within the frequency range @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "the average energy density per frequency @xmath28 in a region with dimension @xmath29 in the jet comoving frame can be obtained @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the number density of synchrotron photons can be obtained by @xmath32 and @xmath33 reads @xmath34 here @xmath35 is planck constant , and @xmath36 .",
    "we have employed relationship @xmath37 to derive equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the mean energy density is expressed by @xmath38 for @xmath39 . defining @xmath40 as @xmath41 we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes @xmath44 .",
    "since the opening angle of jet ( @xmath45 ) is much less than @xmath46 , it is then reasonable to assume that the blr reflection approximates to plane mirror with thickness @xmath47 and electron number density @xmath48 .",
    "the distance distribution of reflected synchrotron photons has been discussed by ghisellini & madau ( 1996 ) . the angular distribution has not been issued .",
    "since the thickness of mirror is zero , the energy density of reflected synchrotron emission sharply increases when blob is close to the mirror . in fact if we drop the assumption of zero - thickness of mirror , this characteristic will disappear .",
    "we will deal with this sophisticate model in future . because the reflected synchrotron emission is isotropic in observer s frame , the blob receives the reflected photon beamed within a solid angle @xmath45 .",
    "the subsequent section will pay attention to this effects . neglecting the angle - dependent distribution of reflected photon field , we approximate the doppler factor @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the mirror ( reflecting clouds in broad line region ) has thomson scattering optical depth @xmath51 .",
    "the received photon density @xmath52 in the jet comoving frame can be then approximately written as @xmath53 where we use @xmath54 ( there are two doppler shifts due to mirror effects ) .",
    "the convenient form of cross section of photon - photon collision is ( coppi & blandford 1990 ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the usual @xmath56-function .",
    "this approximation is only valid for case of isotropic radiation field .",
    "the rsy component is seen by the blob within the solid angle @xmath57 .",
    "although the cross section of photon - photon interaction holds , the interacting possibility among photons reduces by a factor of @xmath58 due to the beaming effects , which effectively reduces the opacity .",
    "thus the pair production optical depth for photon with energy @xmath59 reads @xmath60 here @xmath61 is @xmath62 we will show the validity of the above approximation in the next subsection .",
    "supposing that rsc operates efficiently in @xmath5-ray loud blazars , we can get @xmath63 from the observations @xmath64 from equation ( 11 ) we have @xmath65 and @xmath66 from equation ( 11 ) we know that the observed @xmath63 represents the reflection ratio and doppler factor of jet motion as long as the compton catastrophe does not occur .",
    "if we set @xmath67 , we get @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "this value is the lowest one in the model of sikora , begelman & rees ( 1994 ) who suggest @xmath70 .",
    "in fact we can roughly adopt @xmath18 as the covering factor which is usually taken to be 0.1 in fitting the broad emission line by photoionization model .",
    "inserting @xmath10 and @xmath71 [ eqs(1 ) and ( 6 ) ] into @xmath72 ( eq .",
    "10 ) , and letting @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we have the pair production optical depth for @xmath75 in the observer s frame @xmath76 where @xmath77 ( @xmath78 for @xmath79 ) .",
    "there are five observational parameters : @xmath7 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath63 ; and the unknown doppler factor @xmath83 . for the typical value of parameters , @xmath84 , @xmath85hz , and @xmath86hz ,",
    "@xmath87  day , and @xmath88 , we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "figure 1 shows the opacity due to pair production of photons with very high energy encountering with the reflected synchrotron photons .",
    "the equation ( 15 ) tells us the constraints on vhe from jet : ( 1 ) smaller @xmath63 , i.e. stronger reflection , will leads to the absorption of tev photons .",
    "this parameter represents the energy density reflected by the blr cloud including the bulk relativistic motion . from this estimation",
    "we know that tev photon will be absorbed by the reflected synchrotron photons provided that @xmath91 .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath92 is sensitive to @xmath7 and @xmath80 .",
    "( 3 ) @xmath92 is proportional to @xmath93 , in contrast to the usual down - limit ( see mattox et al 1993 , and dondi & ghisellini 1995 ) , providing the upper limit doppler factor of bulk motion from @xmath94 , @xmath95 this is a new constraint , which is expressed by the observational quantities .",
    "it lends us a simple and efficient way to select tev candidates from known blazars in term of their known characteristics .",
    "the received photons reflected by blr in comoving frame is anisotropic , therefore , the pair opacity should be carefully treated .",
    "we have made important approximations that the blr is thought to be a plane mirror and treated the photon - photon interaction in an approximate way .",
    "now let us show the validity of this approximation .",
    "we adopt the geometry shown in fig 1c of ghisellin & madau ( 1996 ) .",
    "they show that the energy density of reflected synchrotron photon strongly depends on the location of emitting blob .",
    "we should admit that the aximal symmetry holds in the reflected synchrotron emission .",
    "we approximate the thomson scattering event by isotropic scattering with cross section @xmath96 and neglect recoil , which is a very good approximation when @xmath97 . the angular distribution of reflected synchrotron emission is given by @xmath98 ( @xmath99 is a constant ) , the function @xmath100 determines the angular distribution of reflected synchrotron photons ( ghisellini & madau 1996 ) @xmath101 where @xmath102^{-2}$ ] , and @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the distance of blob to the center .",
    "figure 2 shows the angular distribution in blob comoving frame .",
    "it can be seen that the geometry effect of reflecting mirror isotropizes the radiation at some degrees , but the beaming effect still dominates .",
    "it is still a good approximation that the radiation is beamed with a cone of solid angle @xmath45 .",
    "thus the pair opacity can be written as ( gould & schrder 1967 ) @xmath105 where @xmath106 and the photon - photon cross section @xmath107 reads @xmath108,\\ ] ] where @xmath109 is the speed of the electron and positron in the center of momentum frame @xmath110^{1/2}$ ] . performing the integral we have @xmath111 where @xmath112 reads @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 is the integral of @xmath116 over the entire broad line region , which can be evaluated as @xmath117        + \\sin \\theta_0 \\ln \\left[\\frac{\\sin \\phi_1}{\\sin \\phi_2}\\right ]                                                            \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "the function @xmath112 is plotted in fig 3 . since the beamed radiation field reduces the effective cross section of photon - photon interaction by a factor @xmath121 , it would be convenient to check our approximation by the quantity @xmath122 .",
    "we can easily find that it is close to 0.3@xmath1230.4 when @xmath124 , suggesting our approximation is accurate enough .",
    "it should be pointed out that the present treatments of reflected synchrotron radiation can be conveniently extended to the inclusion of the radiation from the secondary electrons if we further study the pair cascade in the future .",
    "the last two subsections are devoted to the _ internal _ absorption of tev photons , the developments of pair cascade due to the present mechanism will be treated in a preparing paper ( wang , zhou & cheng 2000 )",
    ". however it would be useful to compare the dimensions and radiation of the pair cloud due to the _ internal _ absorption and the pair halo suggested by aharonian , coppi , & veolk ( 1994 ) , who argue the formation of pair halo due to the interaction of tev photons from agns with infrared photons of cosmological background radiation .",
    "this _ external _",
    "absorption produces pairs , which are quickly isotropized by an ambient random magnetic field , forming a extended halo of pairs with typical dimension of ( @xmath125mpc ) . without specific mechanism",
    "we know that the time scale of halo formation is of about @xmath126 yr .",
    "usually this absorption is regarded as the main mechanism of deficiency of tev emission from _",
    "egret_-loud blazars ( stecker & de jager 1998 ) .",
    "let us simply estimate the scale of pair halo before it is isotropized by the ambient magnetic field .",
    "assuming the intergalactic magnetic field @xmath127 gauss , then the mean free path of pair electrons in halo reads @xmath128 the initial halo is of such a dimension , which is much larger than that of intrinsic absorption case .",
    "aharonian , coppi , & volk ( 1994 ) have suggested some signatures of such an extended halo , especially for the light curves in high energy bands ( coppi & aharonian 1999 ) .",
    "anyway this is much larger than that of the present internal pair cloud .",
    "thus it is easier to distinguish the two cases .",
    "we have set a new constraint on the very high energy emission in term of observable quantities . as the applications of the present model",
    ", we would like to address some properties of very high energy from blazars .",
    "the broadband continuum of blazars show attractive features which indicate the different processes powering the objects .",
    "the ratio @xmath129 of @xmath0-ray luminosity to optical in flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) is quite different from that in bl lacs ( dondi & ghisellini 1995 ) .",
    "comastri et al ( 1997 ) confirmed this result in a more larger samples and found this mean ratio is roughly of unity in bl lacs and @xmath130 , namely @xmath131 in fsrqs .",
    "ghisellini et al ( 1993 ) , using the classical limit of ssc model , show that there is a systematical difference in doppler factors @xmath83 between bl lacs and core - dominated quasars , @xmath132 for bl lacs and @xmath133 for core - dominated quasars .",
    "these differences have been confirmed by gijosa & daly ( 1996 ) who assume that the particles and magnetic field are in equipartition .",
    "this difference would lead to more prominent difference of reflected synchrotron photon energy density , suggesting a different mechanism in these objects .",
    "the two systematically different features in @xmath63 and doppler factor @xmath83 strongly suggest that the different mechanism of @xmath0-ray radiation may operate in these objects . from eq.(15 ) it is believed that the deficiency of tev emission in radio - loud quasars may be _ intrinsic _ due to the present mechanism .",
    "whipple observatory had ever searched for tev gamma - ray emission for 15 egret - agns with low redshift , but only mrk 421 has positive signal(kerrick et al 1995 ) . even at present stage only three x - ray",
    "selected bl lacs have been reported as tev emitters , mrk 421 , mrk 501 and 1es2344 + 514 ( cataness et al 1997 ) , and pks 2155 - 304 is a potential tev emittor ( chadwick et al 1999 ) .",
    "we can apply the present model to the two representative sources : mrk 421 and 3c 279 for specific illustration .",
    "_ mrk 421 : _ this is an x - ray selected bl lac object , and has been detected gev @xmath0-ray emission by egret ( lin et al 1992 ) , and the first tev emission by whipple ( punch et al 1992 ) .",
    "it has been extensively and frequently observed by telescopes from radio to tev bands(kerrick et al 1995 , macomb et al 1995 , takahashi et al 1996 , krennrich et al 1999 ) .",
    "tev observations of mrk 421 by whipple show that the tev photon did not flare much more dramatically than the x - rays , suggesting that the enhanced high - energy electrons were scattering off a part of the synchrotron spectral energy distribution that remained constant ( takahashi et al 1996 ) . roughly speaking this object",
    "satisfies the energy equipartition for the two power peaks(zdziarski & krolik 1993 , macomb et al 1995 ) , suggesting @xmath134 ( macomb et al 1995 ) , and pure ssc model agrees with the observations ( krennrich et al 1999 ) , suggesting @xmath135 .",
    "this indicates the rsc process is not important .",

    "the gamma - ray emission extends from 50 mev to an astounding tev .",
    "data combined over several periods ( lin et al 1992 ) reveal a hard gev spectrum ( @xmath136 ) by egret and a steeper one at tev energies ( @xmath137 ) from the whipple observatory ( schubnell et al 1994 ) , implying a spectral break .",
    "the multiwavelegenth spectrum shows that @xmath138hz , @xmath139hz , and @xmath140 ( macomb et al 1995 , kubo et al 1998 ) .",
    "the shortest timescale of @xmath0-ray variability is about @xmath141 minutes ( gaidos et al 1996 ) .",
    "if we take @xmath88 and @xmath142 , we have @xmath143 for tev photons .",

    "we can estimate the scattering medium @xmath145 [ @xmath146 when we take @xmath147 and @xmath148 , suggesting the mirror effects can be ruled out in this object .",
    "this result agrees to the absence of any evident emission lines in mrk 421 .",
    "interestingly , celotti , fabian & rees ( 1998 ) have suggested from rapid tev variability of mrk 421 that its accretion rate is lower than @xmath149 eddington rate .",
    "they thus propose that advection - dominated accretion flow or ion pressure supported tori ( ichimaru 1977 , rees et al 1982 , narayan & yi 1994 ) may power the luminosity .    _",
    "3c 279 : _ this is a typical fsrq .",
    "the first whipple observation shows negative signal in tev ( kerrick et al 1995 ) , however the multiwavelength simultaneous observations by _ egret _ , _ asca _ , _ rxte _ , _ rosat _ , _ iue _ in 1996 january - february show an intensive flare with very flat spectrum in _ egret _ band ( wehrle et al 1998 ) , showing @xmath150 at the high state of @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "it has been argued that rsc may explain the 1996 gamma - ray flare ( wehrle et al 1998 ) .",

    "therefore it is expected that no tev emission occurs in this object .",
    "however it is interesting to note that this is due to the _ intrinsic _ mechanism .",
    "we hope that there will be some effects due to the presence of pair production in the vhe flare ( wang , zhou & cheng 2000 ) . the q1633 + 382 ( mattox et al 1993 ) is quite similar to 3c 279 , but it shows much smaller @xmath156 .",

    "this will cause the more stronger `` _ intrinsic _ '' absorption of vhe photons in fsrqs than that in bl lacs .",
    "it is predicted that there is general absence of very high energy emission in fsrqs , owning to the attenuation of vhe photons by the blr reflection of synchrotron emission .",

    "intrinsic _ absorption of tev photons may operate in some objects , especially in fsrqs .",
    "this constraint is cause by the motion of blob itself .    although the origin of @xmath0-ray emission in blazars still remains open , vhe observations sets strong constraints on blazar s radiation mechanism .",
    "these constraints are : ( 1 ) brightness temperature exceeding the kellermann - pauliny - toth ( begelman et al 1994 ) , ( 2 ) multiwavelength light curves based on the homogeneous model ( mastichiadis & kirk 1997 ) , ( 3 ) high energy variations in x - ray and @xmath0-ray including interaction with background ir radiation ( coppi & aharonian 1999 ) .",
    "these constraints are mainly based on ssc model .",
    "the deficiency of vhe photons from high redshift @xmath5-ray loud blazars may be explained by the interaction of the cosmic background radiation fields with the vhe photons .",

    "three bl lac objects have been found to show @xmath158 and @xmath159 emission , indicating the existence of broad line region in these objects ( vermeulen et al 1995 , corbett et al 1996 ) , even mrk 421 has been detected weak luminosity of a broad emission line ( morgani , ulrich & tadhunter 1992 ) .",

    "<S> photons with very high energy up to tev ( vhe ) emitted from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) provide some invaluable information of the origin of @xmath0-ray emission . </S>",

    "<S> egret _ , only three low redshift x - ray selected bl lacs ( mrk 421 , mrk 501 , and 1es 2344 + 514 ) are conclusive tev emitters ( pks 2155 - 304 is a potential tev emitter ) since vhe photons may be absorbed by cosmological background infrared photons ( _ external _ absorption ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on the `` mirror '' effect of clouds in broad line region , we argue that there is an _ intrinsic _ mechanism for the deficiency of tev emission in blazars . employing the observable quantities we derive the pair production optical depth @xmath1 due to the interaction of vhe photons with the reflected synchrotron photons by electron thomson scattering in broad line region . </S>",
    "<S> this sets a more strong constraints on very high energy emission , and provides a sensitive upper limit of doppler factor of the relativistic bulk motion . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested to distinguish the _ intrinsic _ absorption from the _ external _ by the observation on variation of multiwavelegenth continuum . </S>"
