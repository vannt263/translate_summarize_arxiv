    "one of the most puzzling questions in physics concerns why we do not see quantum superposition phenomena in the macro world  @xcite . in quantum mechanics",
    "superposition states are a crucial part of the description of the micro world , while in classical mechanics they are meaningless .",
    "this was highlighted by the thought experiment described by schrdinger in 1935 , where a cat is put into a superposition of alive and dead states  @xcite .",
    "although schrdinger s thought experiment is unachievable , there have been many more realistic proposals for creating systems that can be placed in a macroscopic superposition if the system is sufficiently decoupled from the environment  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on what prevents the production of a cat state in superfluid flow , rather than on decoherence issues .",
    "our discussion leads to some rather straightforward but nevertheless important conclusions .",
    "superpositions have been experimentally studied in various forms  @xcite , including two slit electron interference  @xcite and interferometry with atoms and molecules  @xcite .",
    "more recently larger systems have also been put into superposition states  @xcite .",
    "experimental signatures of large scale quantum superpositions have been observed in superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) .",
    "the superposition was between states of different trapped flux or opposite currents flowing around the device .",
    "truly macroscopic systems can be defined as being visible with the naked eye or have a macroscopic measurable quantity associated with them .",
    "the currents measured in the squid consisted of approximately @xmath1 cooper pairs in a loop of diameter @xmath2 and produce a measurable magnetic flux , meaning",
    "tunnelling between two macroscopically distinct states had been achieved  @xcite .",
    "becs hold promise for realising similar results as they contain @xmath3 atoms with a high proportion in the same quantum state .",
    "they also have significant advantages over squids since they are highly controllable : the coupling between condensates and the strength of the interactions between atoms can be tuned over many orders of magnitude .",
    "they are also weakly interacting , which allows us to develop simple models to investigate macroscopic quantum effects in becs at the microscopic level  @xcite . to study macroscopic superpositions",
    "we need good control of the macroscopic parameters that influence the energy of the quantum states of the system . in the case of a squid",
    "the macroscopic variable is the external magnetic field , which can be applied accurately to the system over a large range of values .",
    "this allows an easily controllable phase to be applied around the loop . by larmor s theorem  @xcite ,",
    "the analogue of applying an external magnetic field to charged particles in a loop is to move to the rest frame of the rotating potential that holds the neutral atoms of the bec . the same effect",
    "could also be achieved by producing a flow of atoms round the loop by using bragg scattering to imprint phases on the lattice sites  @xcite , or producing an effective magnetic field using two resonant laser beams  @xcite .",
    "there have already been a number of theoretical proposals for creating cat states and several using bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite . in section  [ sec : loop ]",
    "we first look at a simple 1-d loop with @xmath0 particles on it and a barrier placed at one position .",
    "using perturbation theory we show how a cat state of quasi - momentum ( or flow ) can be produced , and investigate the effects that inhibit its realisation .",
    "this analysis is developed in section  [ sec : bec ] using the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) approach developed by hallwood _ et al . _",
    "it enables us to study quantum effects on an atomic level using the bhm  @xcite rather than the macroscopic approach used to describe the squid  @xcite .",
    "the problem is tackled using the perturbation results derived in section  [ sec : loop ] for an effective two state system .",
    "the original @xmath4 matrix hamiltonian , where @xmath5 is the total number of states , is reduced to the desired @xmath6 matrix leaving a single coupling term between the two distinct multiparticle states where the atoms share the same flow state .",
    "this is done by finding all the possible coupling paths between the two multiparticle states via intermediate states . from this model",
    "we are able to understand what factors inhibit the creation of a superposition as the system gets larger even if decoherence effects can be removed . in order to try and improve the `` quality '' of the superposition we consider differences between our model and that of the squid in section  [ sec : lrf ] .",
    "our analysis supports that presented by leggett in ref .",
    "@xcite where he emphasises the role of the adiabatic limit in the operation of a squid .",
    "when discussing macroscopic systems we need to be careful with our terminology . in this paper we refer to a _ flow state _ as a state that describes the quasi - momentum or flow of each atom , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the position and quantised value of flow for atom @xmath10 .",
    "the states obtained by diagonalising a hamiltonian are called _ energy states _ with the _ ground state _ having the lowest energy .",
    "states with all atoms with the same flow are called _ single flow states _ and the other states where not all atoms have the same flow are called _ multiple flow states_.    a cat state takes the form , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are both single flow states containing @xmath0 particles . in these states",
    "all particles have the same flow , so only one flow is labelled .",
    "the most general description for a system of particles is the many - body schrdinger equation , which has the form , @xmath14 \\psi_{k_1k_2 ... }(r_1,r_2 , ... ) .",

    "we can not solve eq .",
    "[ eq : mbse ] directly , so we first simplify and then use perturbation theory to investigate some relevant features .",
    "initially , we consider one particle confined in a one dimensional loop of radius @xmath17 .",
    "there is only an angular dependence , @xmath18 , or if we wish to consider the position on the circumference , an @xmath19 dependence .",
    "eventually we will apply a phase around the loop , which can be considered as a rotation of the loop , then use perturbation theory to consider the effect of a barrier ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] ) .",
    "we then consider state with several particles .",
    "if all interactions and barriers are ignored the schrdinger equation takes the simple free particle form : @xmath20 which has solutions @xmath21 , and energy @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a normalisation constant , @xmath24 is the circumference of the loop and @xmath25 is an integer representing the different flow states . for example , when @xmath26 there is zero flow , and when @xmath27 there is a @xmath28 phase around the loop indicating one quantum of clockwise flow . throughout this paper",
    "we shall use the convention that positive phase variations correspond to clockwise flow .",
    "the quantisation of flow is due to the periodic boundary conditions of a loop .     and has a barrier centred at @xmath29.,width=151 ]    applying a phase around the loop changes the momentum term in the hamiltonian .",
    "this is similar to the vector potential term added to the hamiltonian of an atom in an external magnetic field or moving to the rest frame of a rotating object  @xcite . for instance if we rotated the loop and moved into its rest frame the momentum of an atom becomes @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the momentum of the atom in the lab frame and @xmath32 is the velocity that the loop is rotating in the lab frame . the additional velocity can be represented in terms of phase , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the applied phase to the loop and @xmath35 is the circumference of the loop .",
    "we can see where eq .",
    "[ eq : appl_ph ] comes from by considering the macroscopic wave function of a bec  @xcite , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the phase of the condensate and @xmath38 is the density , which we assume is constant for all @xmath39 .",
    "when the phase is not constant throughout the condensate there is a velocity field associated with it , @xmath40 if we move to the rest frame of a rotating loop then there will be an effective phase around the loop , @xmath34 , in addition to the phase due to the momentum of the atoms , @xmath41 . by considering a linearly varying phase around the loop we get eq .",
    "[ eq : appl_ph ] . in the rotating frame",
    "the schrdinger equation now takes the form : @xmath42    even though the system is finite in size , an atom travelling around the loop will see a periodic potential , so the system is in effect a perfect infinite periodic potential .",

    "this means that as the number of particles increases , @xmath81 will diverge from @xmath70 more quickly as the phase is changed . for larger systems the range of values of @xmath34 that still produce a cat like state will be narrow , which means it could become experimentally infeasible to produce a superposition .    for @xmath82",

    "to produce a good cat state we need to separate the single flow states from the excited states .",
    "this is essentially what is realised in successful experiments to date .",

    "the coupling to other flow states , which reduces the ability to make cat states , is similar to decoherence where the macroscopic state is coupled to other states via interactions with the environment .",
    "there is however a crucial difference , because the coupling is due to the system itself and can be reduced by making the barrier smaller , although this requires more accurate control of macroscopic parameters to make a cat state .    from eq .",

    "this coupling is , of course , effected directly by the energy defect to intermediate states .",
    "this makes the transition less likely for larger systems , because more energy is needed for all atoms to make the transition and gives the @xmath106 term , which decreases the energy gap at the anti - crossing .",

    "we shall also consider briefly how having a continuous loop with a barrier , and not three sites , will improve our chances of making a cat state .",

    "an electric dipole - dipole interaction can be induced by applying a strong d.c .",
    "electric field across the condensate  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown to be possible to trap atoms with larger magnetic moments , so interactions beyond s - waved scattering must be considered  @xcite . there has in fact been a good deal of experimental and theoretical work on the dipole - dipole interaction  @xcite . in this paper",

    "@xcite , where the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction potential is thus given by  @xcite , @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the vector joining the interacting particles , @xmath205 is the magnetic permeability of the vacuum and @xmath206 are the magnetic moments of the atoms .",
    "this can be simplified by assuming the magnetic moments of each atom points in the same direction . adding the s - wave scattering length potential ,",
    "the total interaction potential then takes the form  @xcite , @xmath207 the first term is the usual short range interaction with an @xmath208-wave scattering length of @xmath120 and atomic mass @xmath209 .",
    "the second term is due to the dipole - dipole interaction of strength @xmath210 . as we are only dealing with a 2-d plane we can set @xmath211 .",

    "[ eq : on_int ] becomes infinite for @xmath220 , which is the case for on site interactions .",
    "this problem arises due to the pseudo - potential form of the dipole - dipole interaction . a better representation of the potential is required to solve this , which is investigated by ronen _",
    "et al . _",
    "even if the @xmath208-wave scattering is small and the dipole - dipole interaction is large we can see that @xmath214 is always smaller than @xmath213",
    ".    again we are interested in the flow of the atoms , rather than position , so we transform to the flow basis defined by eq .",
    "[ eq : quasimodes ] .",
    "[ eq : ham_dip ] then takes the form : @xmath221 in order to get a good cat we need the extra long range interactions to increase the difference in energy between the single flow states and the multiple flow states . examining the terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : ham_mom_d ] we can see the long range interactions reduce the coupling between the different states , but do not increase the energy difference between the pure and multiple flow states .    another difference between this model and that of the squid is the setup of the loop .",
    "although our system forms a loop there are only three points at which the atoms can sit . in the squid there are sections that are superconducting . in these sections",
    "the long range interactions prevent atoms having different flow  @xcite , and make the cat state less phase sensitive .",
    "the gap to excited states in the _ charged _ superconductor is , of course , the plasma frequency .",
    "it is the junction that acts as a mechanism that creates the superposition of phases of the superfluid wavefunction .",
    "this is equivalent to the decaying atom in schrdinger s cat thought experiment . due to the small numbers of atoms in the junction it is relatively easy to create a superposition of states of uncertain phase , along with the demands of the uncertainty relation @xmath222 .",
    "the phase of the junction is coupled to the rest of the superfluid atoms , because of phase matching around the loop . if the loop contained a macroscopic number of atoms then this would in term form a macroscopic superposition .",
    "this is equivalent to the life of the cat being coupled to the atom .    in a squid ,",
    "if the junction forms a superposition of phases then the rest of the loop will `` follow '' , as excitations of the super conductor are limited by the coulomb interaction , which produces a gap equal to the plasma frequency .",
    "future work will examine this issue further to see how a squid like systems can be made using neutral atoms .",
    "hopefully this will allow us to understand how to make stable cat states by showing the junctions only require numbers of atoms in the range we have investigated here and that they can be coupled to large numbers of superfluid atoms .",
    "excitations are certainly a problem when the junction is coupled to the neutral superfluid regions .",
    "if the superposition is not produced adiabatically then phase and density fluctuations will be produced in the loop . hopefully atom - atom interactions can be used to limit this effect in the same way that the coulomb force limits excitations in the squid  @xcite .",
    "we show three reasons , other than decoherence , why macroscopic quantum effects are so hard to see in bose - einstein condensates .",
    "we illustrate this by finding macroscopic superposition states of flow , firstly in a 1d loop , then in a ring of coupled bose - einstein condensates .",
    "firstly , we show that the energy of macroscopic states varies rapidly with the externally applied phase making it hard to keep the degeneracy needed for good coupling between them .",
    "secondly , this coupling decreases as the size of the system increases , due to a larger number of intermediate states being involved . finally , as more particles are introduced there are more possible flow states for the system to occupy .",
    "even if the amplitudes for being in a multiple flow state are small it still reduces the total amplitude in the two macroscopic states . to avoid this",
    "we need a large energy gap between our macroscopic superposition states and the multiple flow states .",
    "our results clearly show why it is hard to make systems with macroscopic quantum properties and will be useful in finding the best setup to produce a macroscopic superposition .",
    "these problem can be alleviated by coupling a microscopic mechanism that creates the superposition to a macroscopic system , as in schrdinger s initial thought experiment where the microscopic mechanism is the decaying atom and the macroscopic object is the cat . in the context of the systems studied in this paper ,",
    "an appropriate solution may be a microscopic josephson junction coupled to a macroscopic superfluid ring ."
