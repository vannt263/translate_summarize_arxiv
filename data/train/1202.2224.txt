    "granular materials show fluid - like behavior when they are supplied sufficient energy by external vibration .",
    "fluidized states of granular matter have been studied as interesting examples of non - equilibrium fluids .",
    "they exhibit a rich variety of phenomena such as convection , pattern formation on the surface , and segregation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "besides these pattern - forming instabilities , the plain stationary state of vibrated granular fluids without complex spatial structures serves as an archetypal example of non - equilibrium stationary states ( nesss ) .",
    "it has been a fundamental goal for many years to find any thermodynamic - like description or to identify the common property of fluctuations in a wide variety of nesss in nature .",
    "one of the important issues addressed in this paper is the validity of the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr ) in granular fluids subject to external vibration .",
    "an fdr connects the response of an equilibrium system to a small perturbation with the time correlation of spontaneous fluctuations in the system without perturbation .",
    "recently , there has been much interest in how an fdr is violated or should be modified in ageing systems , such as glass , and in nesss of various systems .",

    "@xcite for recent reviews . )    for granular systems , fdrs have been studied for several situations .",
    "much work has been devoted to the case of freely cooling granular gas , where the gas develops freely without external forces and `` cools '' as a result of the dissipative nature of the grain interactions .",
    "the aim has been to derive a ( modified ) green - kubo relation from which transport coefficients can be calculated  @xcite . while there is no stationary state for a freely cooling granular gas , a granular gas ness can be achieved by supplying energy from outside by means of external forcing . a typical experimental means of injecting energy is to shake a container or vibrate a bottom wall ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case where the shaking ( or vibrating ) is strong enough to inject energy to all grains by frequent collisions with the vibrating wall",
    ", the effect of the vibrating wall is often modeled using a thermal bath that couples to every particle .",
    "fdrs in such uniformly driven granular systems have been studied in refs .",
    "et al_.  @xcite carried out numerical simulations of a model of uniformly driven granular gas and studied fdrs for two different observables .",
    "they observed that the fdrs were satisfied if the equilibrium temperature in the fdr for a system at equilibrium was replaced by the granular temperature , defined as the mean - square fluctuation of the grain velocity .",
    "garz  @xcite studied the diffusion of impurities immersed in a granular gas under the influence of uniform driving forces analytically .",
    "they showed that a modified form of the einstein relation , in which the temperature of the gas is replaced by the temperature of the impurity , is violated due to the non - maxwellian behavior of the impurity velocity distribution function .",
    "et al_.  @xcite analyzed a mean - field model of uniformly driven granular gas and showed that the effective temperature defined by an fdr depends on the frequency .",
    "in the case where the shaking ( or vibrating ) is not strong enough to be regarded as uniform driving , energy injection through a boundary has to be explicitly considered .",
    "et al_.  @xcite studied the volume fluctuations of a vibrated low - density granular gas confined at the top by a mobile piston numerically . in this system ,",
    "energy is supplied from the vibrating bottom wall .",
    "they discussed the interpretation of an effective temperature defined by requiring the same relation between fluctuations of volume and compressibility as in equilibrium systems .",
    "the fdrs and effective temperatures in much denser systems have also been studied by several authors  @xcite . among these studies ,",
    "we refer to an experimental study by danna _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , because their theory based on a langevin equation formally has the same form as ours , although their experimental setup was very different .",
    "they performed an experiment to observe the fluctuating motion of a torsion oscillator immersed in vibration - fluidized granular matter and found that it can be described to first approximation by the formalism for brownian motion in equilibrium , and an fdr with an effective temperature approximately holds .",
    "we investigated the fluctuating motion of the center of mass ( com ) in an ness of granular matter fluidized by an external energy source located at a bottom wall , under the influence of gravity . instead of using macroscopic probes such as a piston  @xcite or torsion oscillator  @xcite , we focused on the position of the com , which is observable using digital high - speed photography in experiments  @xcite .",
    "our major motivation for studying fluctuations of the com is that a simple ( or universal ) law might hold as a result of the following properties .",
    "first , the fluctuations of macrovariables such as the com position often possess the largest time scales in the system .",
    "second , they are expected to be gaussian in a similar sense to the central limit theorem .",
    "( in the case of a markovian stochastic process , the gaussian property of macrovariables fluctuations can indeed be derived from a master equation of the markovian process  @xcite . ) with this expectation , we proposed a phenomenological theory based on a simple formalism for brownian motion that describes the motion of the com height in the ness of a one - dimensional vibrated granular fluid  @xcite .",
    "we found that the important qualitative features of the dynamics of the com in event - driven molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations were all accounted for by the theory .",
    "the theory was extended to a two - dimensional granular fluid on a thermal wall  @xcite . here ,",
    "we show that when we apply the phenomenological theory to granular fluids in higher dimensions , careful consideration of time scales in granular hydrodynamics  @xcite is necessary . within the time range",
    "for which our theory is valid , it predicts the existence of an fdr .",
    "however , the equilibrium temperature in the fdr for an equilibrium system must be modified by the effective temperature of the com velocity fluctuation . to test our prediction",
    ", we performed extensive and accurate event - driven md simulations for a two - dimensional system of inelastic hard disks on a thermal wall .",
    "our main result is that an fdr with an effective temperature holds within statistical uncertainty for simulations in a high - frequency ( short time ) region , while it is violated in a low - frequency ( long time ) region .",
    "the effective temperature is defined by the com kinetic energy .",
    "we observed in our simulations that the ratio between the effective temperature and the global granular temperature increases with inelasticity ; the former can be more than four times larger than the latter for the highest inelasticity case .",

    "ii , we describe a model granular system and discuss important time scales in the system . in sec .",
    "iii , the langevin equation is introduced , and analytical expressions for the power spectrum and response function of the com height are described briefly .",

    "we adopt periodic boundary conditions in horizontal directions , so as to ignore the boundary ( side - wall ) effects .",
    "collisions between particles are inelastic ; inelasticity of the particle collisions is characterized by a normal restitution coefficient @xmath10 . to avoid any pattern - forming instability in the horizontal directions , we chose both the inelasticity and linear scales of the system in horizontal directions to be sufficiently small that the system remained homogeneous in the horizontal directions .",
    "these conditions are discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "iv .      before discussing the important time scales in the system ,",
    "we define several quantities that characterize the macroscopic properties of the system .",
    "we first define the kinetic energy per particle as @xmath11 and the long time average of @xmath12 in an ness as @xmath13 ( hereafter , the overline on a quantity represents its long time average in an ness ) .",

    "a characteristic length scale of the system in the vertical direction @xmath18 is then defined as @xmath19 .",
    "bromberg _ et al_.  @xcite have suggested that there are three important time scales in this system at the hydrodynamical level : the macroscopic oscillation time @xmath20 ( referred to as the `` fast time scale '' in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the relaxation time for thermal conduction @xmath21 , and the relaxation time for collisional dissipation @xmath22 .    for simplicity , we assume that the system is nearly homogeneous , although this is not true for small @xmath10 and large @xmath1 .",
    "the time scale @xmath20 represents the period of the slowest oscillation in the vertical direction , that is , the period of the sound mode with the longest wavelength .",
    "thus , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the sound velocity .",

    "we obtain @xmath40 .",
    "the relaxation time for collisional dissipation @xmath22 can be estimated as the inverse of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the collision frequency between two particles . substituting the lowest order estimation of @xmath42 based on kinetic theory , @xmath43",
    ", we obtain @xmath44 .",

    "this means that for a system with given @xmath37 and @xmath10 , the macroscopic dynamics with time scaled by @xmath47 are independent of @xmath2 .",

    "they showed that the steady - state profile is governed only by the parameter @xmath51 which is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath53 , the second parameter @xmath54 is related to @xmath55 .",
    "it plays the role of the governing transition parameter from a condensed to fluidized state in a one - dimensional column of beads on a vibrating bottom plate  @xcite . in our study , we consider the case @xmath56 and assume @xmath57 in the following theoretical analysis .",
    "here , we summarize the theoretical derivation of ( i ) the power spectrum , ( ii ) the frequency response function , and ( iii ) the fdr between ( i ) and ( ii ) . first , we introduce a langevin equation as a first approximation that describes the fluctuating motion of the com on the fast time scales @xmath20 and @xmath28 .",

    "@xmath186    the frequency response function was measured using numerical simulations via the following procedure .",
    "first , we prepared for a system in the stationary state with a given @xmath37 , @xmath10 , and @xmath2 after a sufficiently long relaxation time from the initial state of particles with randomly distributed positions and velocities . at @xmath187",
    ", we exerted a small constant external force on all particles in the direction of gravity and measured the height of the com at @xmath188 ; from this com relaxation process , we deduced a response function by the standard procedure given in textbooks ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in other words",
    ", we measured a response function against a step functional external force .",
    "the frequency response function was obtained as the fourier transform of the response function .",
    "it is important to note that in the response of the com height against a small but finite external force in our system , _ nonlinear _ effects resulting from time scale changes were non - negligible .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the relevant time scales shown in eq .",
    "( [ timescales ] ) all depended on @xmath2 and that exerting a constant force in the direction of gravity was equivalent to changing @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , a linear response could be defined only in the limit of small external force .",
    "this shows that our langevin - type theory is different from the well - known langevin theory for brownian motion in a fixed harmonic potential , where the response of a brownian particle is linear against a finite external force .",
    "consequently , we had to exert an external force that was much smaller than the gravitational force in our system , in order to measure the linear response of the com height .",
    "because the fluctuation of the com height of @xmath189 particles was typically much larger than the response against such a small constant force , we needed to perform the response function measurement for a large number of systems with the same parameters @xmath37 , @xmath10 , and @xmath2 but different initial conditions and take an average of the response functions over all realizations .",
    "as shown later , in the case of a constant force that is @xmath190 of the gravitational force , we needed more than @xmath191 realizations to obtain sufficient statistics for clear response functions .",
    "this required relatively long cpu times that impeded long simulations with a wide range of parameters @xmath10 , @xmath37 , and @xmath2 .",
    "we therefore optimized the method by choosing an appropriate parameter to approximately evaluate the response function from a small number of realizations , which could be provided in an acceptable time with our computational facilities .",
    "suppose a system with gravitational field @xmath2 is initially in an ness and the gravitational acceleration is increased at @xmath187 from @xmath2 to @xmath192 .",
    "this is equivalent to exerting a step function external force @xmath193 on the com height , where @xmath194 is the heaviside unit step function .",
