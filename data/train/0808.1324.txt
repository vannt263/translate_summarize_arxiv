    "<S> recent years have seen an explosive research and development of nanoplasmonics in the visible and near - infrared ( near - ir ) frequency regions.@xcite one of the most fundamental effects in nanoplasmonics is nano - concentration of optical energy . </S>",

    "<S> nanoconcentration of optical energy at nanoplasmonic probes made possible optical ultramicroscopy with nanometer - scale resolution and ultrasensitive raman spectroscopy.@xcite it will be very beneficial for the fundamental science , engineering , environmental , and defense applications to be able to nano - concentrate terahertz radiation ( frequency @xmath0 thz or vacuum wavelength @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this will allow for the nanoscale spatial resolution for thz imaging@xcite and introduce the thz spectroscopy on the nanoscale , taking full advantage of the rich thz spectra and submicron to nanoscale structures of many engineering , physical , and biological objects of wide interest : electronic components ( integrated circuits , etc . ) , bacteria , their spores , viruses , macromolecules , carbon clusters and nanotubes , etc . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we establish the principal limits for the nanoconcentration of the thz radiation in metal / dielectric waveguides and determine their optimum shapes required for this nanoconcentration we predict that the adiabatic compression of thz radiation from the initial spot size of @xmath2 to the final size of @xmath3 nm can be achieved with the thz radiation intensity increased by a factor of @xmath4 to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this thz energy nanoconcentration will not only improve the spatial resolution and increase the signal / noise ratio for the thz imaging and spectroscopy , but in combination with the recently developed sources of powerful thz pulses @xcite will allow the observation of nonlinear thz effects and a carrying out a variety of nonlinear spectroscopies ( such as two - dimensional spectroscopy ) , which are highly informative . </S>",
    "<S> this will find a wide spectrum of applications in science , engineering , biomedical research , environmental monitoring , and defense .    </S>",
    "<S> there are existing approaches to deep subwavelength thz imaging and probing based on sharp tips irradiated by a thz source,@xcite adiabatically - tapered metal - dielectric waveguides@xcite similar to optical adiabatic concentrators , and nonlinear microscopic thz sources.@xcite for the development of the thz nanotechnology , it is extremely important to understand spatial limits to which the thz radiation energy can be concentrated ( nanofocused ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a major challenge for the nanoconcentration of the electromagnetic energy in the thz region is the large radiation wavelength in vacuum or conventional dielectrics , @xmath6 , where the thz radiation can only be focused to the relatively very large regions of size @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the developed field of optical energy concentration , which is based on surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) , suggests that one of the ways to solving this problem is to employ the surface electromagnetic waves ( sews ) . in the far infrared ( ir ) </S>",
    "<S> , the dielectric permittivity of metals has large imaginary part which dominates over its negative real part.@xcite this implies that sews propagating along a metal - dielectric flat interface in this frequency range , known as sommerfeld - zenneck waves,@xcite are weakly bound to the surface@xcite and can hardly be used for the confinement of thz radiation .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that periodically perforating flat surfaces of ideal metals with grooves or holes leads to the appearance of sews , which mimic ( `` spoof '' ) spps to be stronger bound to the surfaces@xcite permitting a better control over the thz fields . </S>",
    "<S> it has been predicted that spps on an array of parallel grooves cut on the surface of a perfect conductor wire can be localized by adiabatic deepening of the grooves . at a point , where grooves are approximately a quarter of wavelength of light , </S>",
    "<S> the highest concentration is achieved to be on the order of tens of micrometers . </S>",
    "<S> this method restricts the localization point to a particular frequency , making the concentration very narrow - band . also , the depth of a groove should be @xmath8 , i.e. , in the tens to hundred micron range , which precludes completely nanoscale devices .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known from microwave technology that the ideal - metal waveguides with smooth surfaces support tem waves , where the electric field lines are either infinitely extended or terminate at the metal surfaces normally to them . </S>",
    "<S> the latter case requires the waveguide cross - section topology to be more than single - connected ; an example may be a coaxial waveguide ( `` coax '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> such waveguides possess are very wide - band in frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the thz waveguides can be adiabatically tapered to concentrate energy . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of adiabatic energy concentration comes from ultramicroscopy and nanoplasmonics,@xcite where it has been developed both theoretically and experimentally and used in ultrasensitive surface enhanced raman spectroscopy.@xcite employing these ideas of the adiabatic concentration and using a tapered metal - dielectric waveguide , the thz spatial resolution achieved is @xmath9 across the entire thz spectrum.@xcite    in this letter , for the first time , we establish the fundamental limits and find the principles of designing the optimum and efficient metal / dielectric waveguides suitable for the thz nanofocusing . </S>",
    "<S> the specific examples are for the wide - band concentrators : a plasmonic metal wedge cavity and tapered coax waveguides , which are terminated by funnel - type adiabatic tapers . </S>",
    "<S> such nano - concentrators along with the advent of high - power sources@xcite and sensitive detectors@xcite of thz radiation , will open up an extremely wide range of possible thz applications , in particular , in material diagnostics , probe nanoimaging , biomedical applications etc .  </S>",

    "<S> refs ..    note that an alternative approach to the thz energy concentration using doped semiconductor tapers has also been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> however , the required heavy doping of the semiconductors may cause fast electron relaxation due to the collisions with the inflicted lattice defects and bring about high losses . therefore , in this letter we will pursue the adiabatic nanoconcentration of the thz radiation using metal / dielectric structures .    conventionally for thz and microwave regions , the metals are considered as ideal which is equivalent to neglecting their skin depth @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the permittivity of the metal ( we take into accoint that in the thz region @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 is the reduced wavelength in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> it is true that in the thz region @xmath14 nm . </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , @xmath15 . however , as we show below in this letter , it is the finite skin depth , though as small as it is , that principally limits the ultimum localization size of the thz fields . for larger waveguides </S>",
    "<S> , the thz wave energy is localized mostly in the vacuum ( dielectric ) and its losses , which occur in the metal s skin layer , are correspondingly small . the effective quality factor ( or , figure of merit ) of the waveguide , which shows how many periods the wave can propagate without significantly loosing its energy , can be estimated as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the characteristic minimum size of the waveguide ; this estimate becomes a good approximation for a metal - dielectric - metal planar waveguide [ see below eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ slab_wavenum_1 ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> when the waveguide size reduces to become on the order of the skin depth , @xmath18 , the thz field is pushed into the metal , and the quality factor reduces to @xmath19 , which implies strong losses . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , this establishes the limit to the nanoconcentration : for upper thz region @xmath20 nm , while for the 1 thz frequency @xmath21 nm . </S>",
    "<S> these are the practical limits of the thz nanoconcentration for the noble metals ( silver , gold , and platinum ) and for aluminum .    </S>",
    "<S> if one pursues the goal of creating enhanced local fields in a small region , but not necessarily to efficiently transfer the thz energy from the far field to the near field , then the apertureless snom approach , where a sharp metal or dielectric tip is irradiated by thz radiation , can , in principle , achieve even higher resolution.@xcite however , the efficiency of utilizing the thz energy of the source in this case will be extremely low ; the stray , far - field thz energy may create a significant parasitic background .     </S>",

    "<S> the permittivity of the metal @xmath11 in the thz region has a very large ( @xmath32 ) imaginary part that defines the very small skin depth @xmath33 nm , which justifies the usual consideration of the metals as perfect conductors.@xcite however , as we have already mentioned , for our purposes of the thz nanoconcentration , we need to take into account the field penetration into the metal , which makes the problem plasmonic . in this case , the propagating modes of the system are spps , which are tm modes characterized by the symmetry with respect to the reflection in the center plane . </S>",

    "<S> the imaginary part of the index @xmath30 increases when the central wire thickness @xmath79 decreases , but this dependence is very weak . both @xmath28 and @xmath29 grow dramatically for @xmath95 . </S>",

    "<S> dramatically , it shows the adiabatic nanoconcentration and the intensity increase by more than two orders of magnitude for the nanoconcentration from the waveguide radius @xmath97 , where the thz radiation can be focused , toward @xmath98 nm . </S>",

    "<S> for the true 2d nanoconcentration of the thz radiation below this micron - scale radius , similar to the 1d case of the wedge , to preserve the adiabaticity , a funnel - like tapering is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the tapering of the central wire and that of the outer metal shell do not need to be the same . </S>",
    "<S> however , we found that better results are obtained when it is the case , i.e. , the waveguide is tapered - off self - similarly . in specific calculations , as everywhere in this letter , we assume that the metal of the waveguide is silver , the dielectric is vacuum , and the frequency is 1 thz . doing so , we have found the corresponding grading of the waveguide using eq .  </S>",

    "<S> [ curved_coax.eps ] ( a)-(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> these figures display the thz fields that we have calculated in the wkb approximation for this waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> as one can see from these figures , within the last half micron of the propagation , the electric and magnetic fields of the thz wave efficiently follow the adiabatically curved waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the penetration into the metal of the tangential ( to the metal - dielectric interfaces ) field components for @xmath102 is evident in panels ( b ) and ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal electric field component @xmath23 is significantly localized in the central metal wire [ panel(b ) ] , which is a plasmonic effect .    </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the thz field intensity in the gap ( relative to the intensity @xmath64 at the entrance of this funnel ) on the total radius of the waveguide @xmath90 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ curved_coax.eps ] ( d ) by the red line . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the adiabatic concentration is very efficient . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the thz radiation increases by a factor of @xmath103 when it is compressed from the initial radius of @xmath104 to the radius @xmath105 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the penetration of the fields into the metal for smaller values of the radius @xmath90 ( tighter confinement ) causes losses that dominate over the effect of the concentration . </S>",
    "<S> again , we remind that this funnel waveguide is a continuation and termination for the straigt cone that yields the field enhancement by @xmath106 for @xmath104 [ see fig .  [ coax.eps ] ( f ) ] . consecutively , these two waveguides ( the initial cone continued and terminated by the funnel ) are very efficient , adiabatically compressing the thz radiation from the initial radius @xmath97 to the radius @xmath107 nm increasing its intensity by a factor @xmath5 . even for the final radius @xmath108 </S>",
    "<S> nm , the total thz intensity is increased by a factor of @xmath76 ( which is the products of factors @xmath106 for the cone part and @xmath109 for the funnel . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the optimally graded plasmonic - metal 2d waveguide is very efficient in the concentration and guidance of the thz fields with the transverse radius of confinement @xmath110 nm .    to discuss the results , </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the thz radiation can be concentrated to the @xmath111 nm transverse size in adiabatically graded plasmonic ( metal / dielectric ) waveguides . in the optimum adiabatically - graded , coaxial waveguide , which consists of the initial cone terminated with a funnel , the radiation of a 1 thz frequency whose wavelength is 300 @xmath112 , can be compressed to a spot of 250 nm radius , where its intensity increases by a factor of @xmath5 . even in the case of the extreme compression to a spot of the 100 nm radius , the thz intensity is enhanced by one order of magnitude with respect to the initial intensity of the @xmath113 spot at the entrance of the waveguide . the physical process that limits the extent of this spatial concentration is the skin effect , i.e. , penetration of the radiation into the metal that causes the losses : the thz field penetrates the depth of @xmath14 nm of the metal , which by the order of magnitude determines the ultimum localization radius .    </S>",
    "<S> the thz nanoconcentration predicted in this letter for optimally - graded adiabatic plasmonic waveguides provides unique opportunities for thz science and technology , of which we will mention below just a few . </S>",
    "<S> the nanoconcentration of the thz radiation will provide the thz ultramicroscopy with a thz source of unprecedented spatial resolution and brightness . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the thz intensity by two orders of magnitude along with the novel high - power thz sources@xcite would allow the observation of a wide range of electronic and vibrational nonlinear effects in metal , semiconductors , insulators , and molecules .    </S>",
    "<S> these nonlinear thz phenomena can be used to investigate behavior of various materials in ultrastrong fields , for nonlinear spectroscopy ( including the multidimensional spectroscopy ) , and for monitoring and detection of various environmental , biological , and chemical objects and threats such as single bacterial spores and viruses . </S>",
    "<S> such applications will certainly be helped by very large absorption cross sections of various materials in the thz region . </S>",
    "<S> a distinct and significant advantage of the adiabatic nanofocusing is that the thz energy is mostly concentrated in the hollow region of the waveguide , whose size can be made comparable with the size of the objects of interest : in the range from 1 micron to 70 nm , which is a typical range for bacteria and their spores , and viruses . </S>",
    "<S> this will assure high sensitivity and low background for the objects that are confined inside these waveguides .    </S>",
    "<S> consider as a specific example the spectroscopy or detection of single particles , such as , e.g. , anthrax spores , in the air . </S>",
    "<S> a sample containing the suspected nanoparticles in a gas , which can be air for the frequencies in the transparency windows , can be pumped through a thz waveguide , and the detection can be made for each particle in the gas separately on the basis of the two - dimensional nonlinear thz spectra that are expected to be highly informative for the detection and elimination of the false - positive alarms . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , many other scientific , technological , environmental , and defense applications may become possible . </S>"
