    "short period binary white dwarfs ( wds ) are strong gravitational wave sources and the potential progenitors of type ia @xcite and .ia supernovae @xcite . the gravitational wave radiation and the orbital decay in the shortest period systems may be detected directly by space based missions like the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) and indirectly by ground based observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite lists 12 ultra - compact systems that are guaranteed lisa sources , but predicts that lisa should detect at least several hundred systems .",
    "the elm survey @xcite is opening a new window on short period binary wds and strong gravitational wave sources .",
    "after the discovery of four double wd systems with merger times shorter than 500 myr @xcite , radial velocity follow - up of the elm wds found in the hypervelocity - star survey @xcite and the sdss data release 4 sample @xcite led to the discovery of 12 merger systems , tripling the number of known merging wd systems @xcite . in 2011",
    ", the elm survey identified the three shortest period detached binary wds known , a 12-min orbital period eclipsing system @xcite and two 39-min orbital period systems @xcite .",
    "all three systems show flux variations due to the relativistic beaming effect and two of the three also show ellipsoidal variations due to tidal distortions .",
    "these are the first two tidally distorted wds ever found .",
    "the three systems with @xmath21 h orbital periods are strong gravitational wave sources .",
    "@xcite first demonstrated that the majority of low - mass ( @xmath30.45 @xmath1 ) wds are found in binaries , as the galaxy is too young to form such objects from single stars .",
    "@xcite show that the binary fraction of low - mass wds is at least 70% .",
    "this fraction goes up to 100% for elm wds with @xmath4 0.25 @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the supernovae progenitor survey ( spy , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , on the other hand , finds a significantly lower binary fraction for typical 0.6 @xmath1  wds and only a handful of binaries that will merge within a hubble time @xcite .",
    "hence , elm wds provide the best opportunity to study the population of short period binary wds .    in paper i @xcite of this series",
    ", we studied the population of elm wds found in the hypervelocity star survey . in paper ii @xcite , we presented the sdss data release 4 systems . in paper iii @xcite , we performed a targeted spectroscopic survey of cooler ( @xmath510,000 k ) elm wds selected by color . here , we extend our survey to the sdss data release 7 sample .    section 2 describes our target selection , radial velocity , and x - ray observations .",
    "section 3 presents the orbital and physical parameters of the seven binaries that we targeted for spectroscopic observations .",
    "the entire population of 40 systems observed in the elm survey to date is presented in section 4 along with a discussion of the most interesting systems and trends .",
    "section 5 lists our conclusions and future prospects .",
    "@xcite identifies 12 new elm wd candidates in the sdss data release 7 spectroscopy data , including j0106@xmath61000 @xcite , j0923 + 3028 @xcite , j1518 + 0658 @xcite , and j0651 + 2844 @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the remaining eight objects from this sample , plus j1056 + 6536 from the sdss data release 4 wd catalog @xcite .",
    "we present observations of seven targets with reliable orbital solutions .",
    "the remaining targets need more observations to constrain their orbital parameters and they will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "we used the 6.5 m mmt equipped with the blue channel spectrograph over several different observing runs between 2010 march and 2011 october .",
    "we operate the spectrograph with the 832 line mm@xmath7 grating in second order , providing wavelength coverage 3650   to 4500   and a spectral resolution of 1.2  .",
    "all objects were observed at the parallactic angle , and a comparison lamp exposure was obtained with every observation .",
    "we flux - calibrate using blue spectrophotometric standards @xcite .",
    "we measure radial velocities using the cross - correlation package rvsao @xcite .",
    "we first cross - correlate the observed spectra with a high signal - to - noise wd template .",
    "we then shift the observed spectra to the rest frame , and sum them together to create a template for each object . finally , we cross - correlate the spectra with the appropriate template to obtain the final velocities for each object .",
    "the average precision of our measurements is 20 km s@xmath7 .",
    "we compute best - fit orbital elements using the code of @xcite , which weights each velocity measurement by its associated error .",
    "we perform a monte carlo analysis to verify the uncertainties in the orbital parameters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "the probability of neutron star companions to the majority of the objects identified in the elm survey is only a few per cent .",
    "however , based on the mass function , there are several elm wd systems where the probability of a neutron star ( which would be spun up to a milli - second pulsar , msp ) companion is more than 10% .",
    "radio and x - ray observations are essential to confirm or rule out such companions .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discuss the importance of x - ray observations for the identification of msp companions to elm wds .",
    "blackbody emission from the surface of a possible pulsar companion to the elm wds will be gravitationally bent , allowing observation of @xmath875% of the neutron star surface in x rays even if the radio pulsar beam misses our line of sight @xcite .",
    "all 15 radio msps with precise positions in unconfused regions of the globular cluster 47 tuc have been clearly detected in x rays @xcite .",
    "this result allows us to use the 47 tuc msp sample ( with accurate x - ray luminosities , @xmath9 , due to its well - known distance ) to predict that other msps should have x - ray luminosities above @xmath10 erg s@xmath7 , the minimum @xmath9 of msps in 47 tuc .",
    "thus , deep x - ray observations can confirm or rule out the presence of msp companions in the elm wd binary systems .",
    "we obtained _ chandra _ observations of two previously known elm wds , sdss j082212.57 + 275307.4 and sdss j084910.13 + 044528.7 @xcite , to search for x - ray emission from an msp .",
    "based on the mass function , there is a 15 - 18% probability that these stars have neutron star ( 1.4 - 3 @xmath1 ) companions neither had been previously observed in x rays since the rosat all - sky survey @xcite , which neither detected them nor placed useful limits",

    "we used ciao 4.3 and caldb 4.4.2 to reprocess the data including current calibrations , reducing the backgrounds using very faint mode cleaning .",
    "we constructed images in the 0.3 - 6 kev band , and found no x - ray photons within the 1@xmath11 error circles around each source .",

    "( 2007 ) and the sdss photometry , and the neutral hydrogen column density @xmath12 using the colden tool @xcite .",
    "we use pimms and the x - ray spectrum of the faintest msp in 47 tuc ( 47 tuc - t , 134 ev blackbody ) to produce 0.5 - 6 kev @xmath9 upper limits , which we list in table 1 .",

    "our seven targets with optical spectroscopy data were classified as elm wds based on lower - resolution and signal - to - noise ratio sdss spectra .",
    "we use the mmt spectra to improve the model atmosphere analysis for these targets .",
    "we perform stellar atmosphere model fits using synthetic da wd spectra kindly provided by d.  koester and an evolved version of the analysis code presented by @xcite .",
    "we fit the flux - calibrated spectra as well as the continuum - corrected balmer line profiles . using the spectral continuum",
    "provides improved constraints on effective temperature .",
    "we compare best - fit solutions and find that the parameters differ on average by @xmath19 k in @xmath20 and @xmath21 dex in @xmath22 .",
    "we take these differences as our systematic errors .",
    "we have 14 - 23 individual spectra for each object .",
    "we use the fits to the individual spectra to derive a robust statistical error estimate . @xcite and",
    "@xcite use the sdss spectra to derive physical parameters for the same targets .",
    "our parameters differ on average by @xmath23 k in @xmath20 and @xmath24 dex in @xmath22 .",
    "figure 1 shows the composite spectra and the best - fit models for our targets .",
    "these models provide a good match to the observed composite spectra and the balmer line profiles . the parameters from both the flux - calibrated and continuum - corrected fits are in good agreement with the sdss photometry in all five filters , an indication that our temperature and surface gravity measurements are reliable .",
    "we detect flux calibration problems for only one of our targets , j1056 + 6536 , where the model using the continuum shape is not a good match to the observations .",
    "we use the results from the balmer line profile fitting for this star .",
    "this model agrees remarkably well with the spectral energy distribution based on the sdss photometry .",
    "figure 2 compares the best - fit @xmath20 and @xmath25 measurements for our targets against the predicted evolutionary sequences from @xcite .",
    "based on these tracks , our targets have @xmath26 @xmath1 ; some of them are more massive than predicted from the relatively noisy sdss spectroscopy data .",
    "the physical parameters of all seven systems discussed in this paper are presented in table 3 .",
    "the age and distance estimates are somewhat uncertain for @xmath27 @xmath1  objects , because many of them fall in the gap between 0.17 and 0.18 @xmath1  he - core wd tracks . @xcite and @xcite argue that diffusion - induced hydrogen - shell flashes take place for @xmath28 @xmath1 , which yield small hydrogen envelopes .",
    "hence , lower mass objects have massive hydrogen envelopes , larger radii , lower surface gravities , and longer cooling times .",
    "the inconsistency between the observed parameters for @xmath29 10,000 k and @xmath30 objects and the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 2 ) models makes accurate wd mass and luminosity estimates difficult for them .",
    "fortunately , mass and luminosity change very little over the range of effective temperature and surface gravity sampled by these wds .",
    "we adopt @xmath31 @xmath1  and @xmath32 mag for these objects .",
    "all seven targets show significant velocity variations with peak - to - peak velocity amplitudes of 120 - 640 km s@xmath7  and 1 - 18 h orbital periods .",
    "figure 3 shows the observed radial velocities and the best fit orbits for our targets .",
    "we present the best - fit orbital period ( @xmath33 ) , semi - amplitude ( @xmath34 ) of the radial velocity variations , systemic velocity ( @xmath35 , which includes a small gravitational redshift term ) , the time of spectroscopic conjunction ( the time when the primary is closest to us ) , and the mass function in table 2 .",
    "the correction for the gravitational redshift is a couple km s@xmath7 for a 0.17 @xmath1helium wd , comparable to the systemic velocity uncertainty .",
    "based on the mass function alone , the companions would range from @xmath36 @xmath1  ( for j0845 + 1624 and j1005 + 3550 ) to @xmath37 @xmath1  objects ( for j2103@xmath60027 ) .",
    "such main - sequence companions would be detected in the sdss photometry and spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "hence , the companions are either more massive wds or neutron stars ( msps ) .",

    "@xcite note that there is also a correlation between the companion mass and the elm wd s temperature .",
    "such a trend is also observed for the 38 systems presented in figure 8 ; hotter wds tend to have less - massive companions . at first glance , there is no obvious reason for such a correlation .",
    "however , our interpretation is that the shortest period systems start interacting earlier in their evolution , go through one or two common - envelope phases relatively quickly , and end up with lower - mass companions .",
    "since short period systems also merge before they get a chance to cool down to @xmath010,000 k , there should be a deficit of cooler systems with lower mass companions .",

    "surface detonations due to instabilities in the accretion stream are unlikely for these systems .",
    "hence , we expect merging elm wd systems to evolve into stable mass - transfer am cvn or unstable mass - transfer ( merger ) systems that would lead to the formation of single subdwarf , extreme helium star , or massive wds .",
    "there are about a dozen elm wd systems with extreme mass ratios that are potential progenitors of am cvn systems and supernovae .ia explosions .",

    "<S> we present new radial velocity and x - ray observations of extremely low - mass ( elm , @xmath00.2 @xmath1 ) white dwarf candidates in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 area . </S>",
    "<S> we identify seven new binary systems with 1 - 18 h orbital periods . </S>",
    "<S> five of the systems will merge due to gravitational wave radiation within 10 gyr , bringing the total number of merger systems found in the elm survey to 24 . </S>",
    "<S> the elm survey has now quintupled the known merger white dwarf population . </S>",
    "<S> it has also discovered the eight shortest period detached binary white dwarf systems currently known . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the characteristics of the merger and non - merger systems observed in the elm survey , including their future evolution . </S>",
    "<S> about half of the systems have extreme mass ratios . </S>",
    "<S> these are the progenitors of the am canum venaticorum systems and supernovae .ia . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining targets will lead to the formation of extreme helium stars , subdwarfs , or massive white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> we identify three targets that are excellent gravitational wave sources . </S>",
    "<S> these should be detected by the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa)-like missions within the first year of operation . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining targets are important indicators of what the galactic foreground may look like for gravitational wave observatories . </S>"
