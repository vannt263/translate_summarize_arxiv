    "one of the most important methods to generate integrable equations is to start with a fairly general integrable system and apply to it systematically symmetry reductions .",

    "we propose a different , but equally relevant , procedure to generate integrable lattices .",
    "this procedure consists in constructing , from a given integrable lattice , a sub - lattice which inherits the integrability features of the original lattice .",
    "we consider , as illustrative example of this approach , the 4-point difference equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are functions : @xmath4 , and its sub - lattice , the self - adjoint 5-point scheme : @xmath5 on the star of the square lattice , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are functions : @xmath4 , and where the standard notation @xmath10 is often used throughout the paper .",
    "we exploit the above fact deriving several properties of the 5-point system from the corresponding ( and simpler ) properties of the 4-point system .    as it was shown in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , equation ( [ 4p ] ) is an integrable discretization ( i.e. , a discretization possessing darboux transformations ( dts ) ) of the moutard equation @xmath11 ( the symbol @xmath12 denotes partial differentiation : @xmath13 ) .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , equation is an integrable discretization of the elliptic ( if @xmath14 ) equation @xmath15    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : connection ] we establish the connection between the above difference equations and . in sections [ sec : dt ] and [ sec : s - dts ]",
    "we use the above connection to derive the darboux transformation ( dt ) and its superposition formula of the 5-point scheme ( in all its most distinguished gauge equivalent forms ) from the the darboux transformation and its superposition formula of the 4-point scheme . in section",
    "[ sec : al - geom ] we first construct algebro - geometric solutions of the 4-point scheme and then the corresponding solutions of the 5-point scheme . due to the interesting applications of equations and ( discussed in the second part of this introduction ) ,",
    "these explicit solutions provide examples of discrete holomorphic and harmonic functions and , at the same time , they generate quadrilateral surfaces in @xmath0 .",
    "let us devote the remaining part of the introduction to the presentation of the interesting applications of equations and in differential and discrete geometry , and in the discrete holomorphic function theory .",
    "equation has a very long history .",
    "bianchi constructed the superposition formula for the moutard equation ( [ moutard ] ) in the following form @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are four different general solutions of four different moutard equations , while @xmath21 , @xmath22 are particular solutions of the moutard equation satisfied by @xmath17 , and @xmath23 is a potential connected to @xmath21 , @xmath22 via the conditions @xmath24    [ fig : m - bp ]    using the key observation contained in @xcite , such superposition principle was interpreted in @xcite as an integrable discretization of the moutard equation : @xmath25 in addition , dts and their superposition principle for the discrete moutard equation were also constructed in @xcite .",
    "solutions of the ( real ) moutard equation allow one to construct , via the lelieuvre formulas @xcite , asymptotic nets on hyperbolic surfaces from their normal vector .",
    "analogously , solutions of the ( real ) discrete moutard equation characterize normal vectors of asymptotic lattices @xcite , which can be constructed via the discrete analogue of the lelieuvre formulas @xcite .    also for the elliptic version of equation , the well known schrdinger equation @xmath26 ( which is equation with @xmath27 )",
    ", there exists a geometric interpretation within the theory of isothermally conjugate nets and the corresponding analogue of the lelieuvre formulas @xcite .",
    "the 5-point scheme , introduced in @xcite as an integrable discretization of equation , describes the normal vector of a quadrilateral lattice in @xmath0 , and this embedding is obtained via a suitable generalization of the lelieuvre formulas @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that equations and , which are basic equations in the recently developed theory of the integrable discrete geometries , are also the basic equations of an integrable discretization of the theory of holomorphic and harmonic functions .",
    "indeed the equations @xmath28 @xmath29 undressed versions of equations and , were introduced as basic objects of the discrete holomorphic and harmonic function theory in @xcite ; they correspond to a natural discretization of , respectively , the @xmath30 and laplace operators on the square lattice , and the connection between these two schemes was an important ingredient of the theory . in @xcite ,",
    "this theory was generalized to rhombic lattices ; on the level of the 4-point scheme , it corresponds to the discrete cauchy - riemann equation ( [ 4p ] ) with a nontrivial pure imaginary potential @xmath2 . in @xcite",
    "this theory was extended to discrete riemann surfaces and , in particular , the 4-point scheme ( [ 4p ] ) and the affine form @xmath31 of the self - adjoint 5-point scheme , which corresponds to a discretization of the harmonic equation , were studied on the riemann surface .",
    "a theory of dirac operators and the green s function for planar graphs with rhombic faces were constructed in @xcite .",
    "the connection between the above discrete complex function theory and the discrete complex function theory @xcite based on the integrable cross - ratio equation @xcite was established in @xcite , where a multidimensional generalization of the discrete complex function theory was also considered .",
    "we remark that there exists another natural integrable discretization of elliptic operators on the plane , based on the self - adjoint scheme on the star of a regular triangular lattice @xcite , resulting in a 7-point scheme .",
    "one of the important features of this approach is that this operator is factorized in terms of 3-point operators living on the same lattice .",
    "a discrete complex function theory based on these operators , including the discrete analogue of the cauchy kernel , has been recently developed in @xcite .",

    "suppose that the original lattice ( equation ) be * integrable * ; i.e. , suppose that one can associate with it linear transformations enabling one to construct solutions from solutions ( darboux - type transformations ) , whose superposition exhibits permutability properties ( the bianchi permutability diagram ) . since the infinite class of solutions generated in this way , once restricted , are also solutions of the sub - lattice , this sub - lattice ( equation ) will also be integrable .",
    "we remark that the dimensional reductions are simple examples of such a construction .      in this section",
    "we start with the general 4-point scheme @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are @xmath45-valued functions on @xmath46 , and we explore the possibility to construct , from it , a sub - lattice defined on the subset @xmath47 ( the even grid ) of @xmath48 consisting of points @xmath49 such that @xmath50 is even .",
    "the general 4-point scheme reduces to a 5-point scheme on the even grid if and only if the coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath44 satisfy the constraint @xmath52    consider the @xmath53-point scheme in the elementary square @xmath54 and in its neighbouring squares @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and move to the lhs the terms in which @xmath58 is evaluated on the odd grid and to the rhs the terms in which @xmath58 is evaluated on the even grid : @xmath59 in order to construct a lattice equation not involving @xmath58 on the odd grid , it is sufficient to impose the zero determinant condition for the system , which coincides with the constraint .",
    "the row vector solution @xmath60 of the homogeneous version of the system reads : @xmath61 and the wanted sub - lattice equation is the solvability condition @xmath62 of the kronecker - capelli theorem , where @xmath63 is the column vector representing the inhomogeneous term of the algebraic system .",
    "this solvability condition reads : @xmath64    [ prop:4p - can ] the four point scheme with non - vanishing coefficients @xmath65 satisfying constraint is gauge equivalent to the discrete moutard ( discrete cauchy  riemann ) four point scheme whose corresponding five point scheme is the affine self - adjoint five point scheme .",
    "let the potential @xmath66 be a solution of the system @xmath67 whose compatibility condition is the constraint .",

    "the answer is affirmative and the construction is very simple .",

    "define the function @xmath92 on the whole lattice by the inverses of equations and , and choose the value of @xmath93 at one arbitrary odd point of the lattice .",
    "then , using the 4-point scheme ( [ 4p - affine ] ) and the known values of @xmath93 at the even points , one can construct uniquely a solution @xmath93 of the 4-point scheme ( [ 4p - affine ] ) whose restriction to @xmath79 coincides with @xmath93 .    summarizing the content of the last two sections",
    ", we have shown that any solution of the 4-point scheme ( [ 4p ] ) , once restricted to @xmath79 , generates a solution of the 5-point scheme ( [ 5p - rot ] ) .",
    "viceversa , * any * solution of the 5-point scheme ( [ 5p - rot ] ) can be obtained restricting to @xmath79 a suitable solution of the 4-point scheme ( [ 4p - affine ] ) .      in this section",
    "we show that also the method of `` discretization via transformations '' @xcite , when applied to the elliptic moutard ( schrdinger ) equation , leads to the 5-point scheme thanks to the sublattice approach .",
    "consider the general solution @xmath94 of the schrdinger equation together with its particular solutions @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "therefore the superposition principle of the schrdinger equation is described by the 4-point scheme of the discrete moutard type , which we know is not a proper discretization of .",
    "this seems to be in contradiction with the general rule that the superposition principle of a continuous system provides an integrable discretization of it .",
    "however , as we know , the sub - lattice approach resolves this problem , since the 4-point scheme reduces , on its subgrid , to the 5-point scheme ( see also section [ sec : gauges ] ) , which turns out to be the proper discrete analogue of @xcite .      for the construction of the darboux transformations and in other applications it is useful to introduce the @xmath108-function of the 4-point scheme @xmath109 the fact presented below , which can be checked by direct calculation , explains the introduction of such a potential in a broader context .",

    "an obvious application of the above construction is that , once a sub - lattice of a given integrable lattice is identified , one obtains essentially for free some of its integrability properties . here",
    "we show , for instance , the construction of the darboux transformations @xcite of the 5-point scheme in the affine , equal - field and schrdinger forms , induced by the transformations of the 4-point lattice .",
