    "among the more plausible scenarios of physics beyond the standard model is supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite . in conventional susy models ,",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is neutral and colourless .",
    "however , models exist in which the lsp is coloured .",
    "models with a gluino lsp are reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and include gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models and string motivated supersymmetric models .",
    "stable squarks are cosmologically disfavoured because of their nonzero electric charge  @xcite , but could be sufficiently long - lived to behave like an effectively stable lsp in a detector experiment .",
    "a coloured lsp would hadronize into heavy ( charged and neutral ) bound states .",
    "these bound states ( for example @xmath0 g , @xmath0@xmath1 , @xmath0qqq , @xmath2 , @xmath3qq ) are generically called r  hadrons , where the `` r '' refers to the fact that they carry one unit of r  parity  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we shall focus on the fact that such a hadronized lsp will have measurable interactions in a detector , in contrast to conventional susy studies , in which the lsp is a weakly - interacting particle , i.e.  a neutralino or a sneutrino .",
    "in addition to supersymmetry , other extensions of the standard model have been proposed , which predict the existence of new heavy hadrons , either due to the presence of a new conserved quantum number , or because the decays are suppressed by kinematics or couplings .",
    "for example , theories with leptoquarks predict stable hadronized states , if the yukawa coupling between the leptoquark and its decay products is so small that the leptoquark is long - lived  @xcite .",
    "another example is theories with universal extra dimensions , where exact momentum conservation in all dimensions leads to stable kaluza - klein excitations of e.g.  quarks and gluons , which would form stable hadronizing states  @xcite .",
    "searches for stable massive particles are summarized e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , which includes different search methods .",
    "negative results of searches in ordinary matter and cosmic rays imply that the relic density of such particles must be too small for detection . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is argued that an lsp gluino can indeed have a very small relic density .",
    "alternatively , the cosmological bounds on stable massive particles can be evaded if the hadron decays slowly . in this paper",
    ", we refer to particles as _",
    "stable _ as long as they are stable from a detector point of view .",
    "concerning search methods using accelerators , these are limited by the center of mass energy of the accelerator and are concentrated on charged heavy particle searches  @xcite .",
    "a few searches for neutral hadrons , in particular r  hadrons , exist  @xcite . from accelerator",
    "searches it is clear that , if heavy hadrons with masses less than the order of a hundred gev had existed , they would have been detected . in this paper , particles in which we are interested , and which we classify as _ heavy _ , are particles with masses @xmath4 100 gev .",
    "the energies of heavy hadrons produced at a @xmath5 collider like the lhc are typically about two to three times their own mass , i.e.  they may be relativistic but their mass is still far from negligible . on their trajectory through the detector , they slow down even further .    although electromagnetic interactions of heavy states are well understood , little information is available about nuclear interactions of heavy hadrons , and the resulting energy deposits in a detector calorimeter .",
    "models to describe the nuclear interactions of gluino bound states in particular have previously been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", a new model for the interactions of gluino hadrons is presented , which is more generally applicable to any kind of heavy hadrons , and which provides a convenient basis for future refinements .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , electromagnetic interactions of charged heavy hadrons will be discussed in section  [ sec : ref3 ] .",
    "next , in section 3 , we propose a model describing nuclear interactions of heavy hadrons .",
    "aspects such as hadron mass spectra and nuclear scattering cross - sections will be discussed .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the geant 3 simulation of r  hadronic nuclear interactions . in section  [ sec : pros ] , results of the simulation will be presented , together with studies of typical detector signals . in section  [ atlasref ] , we briefly discuss manifestations of r  hadrons in the atlas experiment , and finally in section  [ con ] , we summarize and discuss future studies .",
    "a charged heavy particle suffers both continuous ionization losses as well as repeated coulomb scatterings  @xcite .",
    "continuous ionization losses of heavy particles are known to be described by the bethe - bloch equation . since electromagnetic losses are proportional to 1/@xmath6 , the losses for a particle moving with @xmath71 are considerable .",
    "the ultra - relativistic rise in electromagnetic energy losses is not relevant here , as can be seen from fig  [ fig:1 m ] .",
    "repeated coulomb scatterings change the particle trajectory .",
    "the deflection angle , being proportional to 1/@xmath8 , is small , the small velocity being compensated for by the large momentum with which a heavy particle is normally produced .",
    "both charged and neutral heavy hadrons lose energy through scattering off nuclei . in the following , a simple and general framework is presented for simulating nuclear interactions of heavy hadrons , independent of the new physics model in which the hadron arises .",
    "exotic colour triplet states will be denoted by @xmath9 , colour antitriplet states by @xmath10 and colour octet states by @xmath11 .",
    "when referring to the mass of a parton , we always mean the constituent mass .",
    "an interpretation in terms of a pole mass or other mass definitions is clearly irrelevant for the qualitative considerations in this paper . for simplicity ,",
    "we take into account only states containing @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks , with constituent masses assumed to be @xmath14 gev .",
    "any stable heavy coloured exotic particle hadronizes and forms a colour singlet , for example @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , etc . the probability that the parton @xmath21 of colour state @xmath22 will interact perturbatively with the quarks in the target nucleon is small , since such interactions are suppressed by the squared inverse mass of the parton . as a consequence , the heavy hadron can be seen as consisting of an essentially non - interacting heavy state @xmath21 , accompanied by a coloured hadronic cloud of light constituents , responsible for the interaction .",
    "the effective interaction energy of the hadron is therefore small , as can be seen by considering a @xmath18 state , e.g.  with a total energy @xmath23=450 gev and a mass @xmath24 of the @xmath11 parton of 300 gev , i.e.  with a lorentz factor of @xmath25=1.5 .",
    "although the kinetic energy of the hadron is 150 gev , the kinetic energy of the interacting @xmath26 system is only @xmath27 0.3 gev , ( if the quark system consists of up and down quarks ) .",
    "thus , the energy scales relevant for heavy hadron scattering processes off nucleons are low ! it is therefore most likely that interaction processes are mediated by reggeons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : processesr]a ) and not by by pomerons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : processesr]b ) . in conclusion",
    ", it becomes apparent that the presence of the heavy parton @xmath21 has two basic consequences .",
    "* it acts as a reservoir of kinetic energy . after an interaction , where the light interacting system loses kinetic energy , new kinetic energy",
    "is transferred to it from the co - moving @xmath21-parton .",
    "* the parton @xmath21 forces the quark system to be in a certain colour - state , in order for the system as a whole to form a colour - singlet state .",
    "this influences the mass spectrum of the hadrons , as will be explored in detail in section  [ hadrons ] .      *",
    "the interactions of the light constituents are of the same character as for an ordinary hadron .",
    "as stressed in the beginning of this section , the heavy state @xmath21 acts as spectator in an interaction . *",
    "the overall size of the hadron as a whole is probably not strongly influenced .",
    "this can be understood by recalling that the wave - function associated with a particle with mass @xmath28 roughly scales as @xmath29 .",
    "the influence of the heavy object @xmath21 on the size of the total hadron is therefore minimal , and the light quarks dominate completely .      in order to establish the signatures of heavy hadrons in a detector",
    ", the mass spectrum of the states must be understood .",
    "for example , if the c@xmath30 state were to be the lightest baryonic state , then decays into it would be kinematically favourable .",
    "this would be important , since the electromagnetic energy losses would then be increased significantly ( if the @xmath11 parton does not carry negative charge ) .",
    "a completely different signature would result if a neutral c@xmath31 state would be the lightest .",
    "the mass of the lowest - lying hadronic states , with no radial excitation or orbital angular momentum , can be approximated by ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath32 in which the summation is over all partons @xmath22 contained in the hadron , @xmath33 is the parton constituent mass , @xmath34 is the su(3 ) colour matrix for parton @xmath22 , @xmath35 is the su(2 ) spin matrix for parton @xmath22 , and @xmath36 is a constant with dimension ( mass)@xmath37 . the second term , responsible for the mass splitting , depends on the colour - state and spin - state of the hadron . in the derivation of the hadron mass spectrum of heavy hadrons , terms involving the heavy parton in the denominator can be neglected .",
    "expressions for @xmath38 and for @xmath39 can easily be derived for a @xmath40 and @xmath26 state  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath40 state can either form a colour antitriplet or a sextet configuration ( @xmath41 ) , while a @xmath26 state can form a colour singlet or an octet state ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath38 are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 when the state is in a colour singlet , antitriplet , sextet and octet configuration , respectively .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath39 are @xmath47 and @xmath48 for a @xmath40 or @xmath26 state with total spin zero and spin one , respectively .",
    "[ eq : hadron ] leads to the familiar mass patterns of the known hadrons .",
    "for example , the @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 systems follow eq .",
    "[ eq : hadron ] reasonably well , with @xmath53 gev@xmath37 ."
