    "as part of the ongoing programme developing radiation hard detectors for the lhc a test beam run was carried out in september 1994 .",
    "the x1 beam from the sps at cern was incident on a telescope provided by l.e.p.s.i . ,",
    "this beam was a tertiary beam : pions with an energy of 70gev were used for the test .",
    "this telescope employs eight silicon microstrip detectors and five trigger scintillators .",
    "the silicon detectors had a 25@xmath0 m implant pitch , but strips were only read - out every 50@xmath0 m .",
    "the intermediate implant strip produces enhanced resolution between the strips .",
    "each of these detectors was 300@xmath0 m thick .",
    "a schematic representation of the telescope can be seen in figure [ fig : tele ] .",
    "the silicon detectors and the test detector were read out with a viking pre - amplifier chip@xcite .",
    "this produces a multiplexed signal which is sampled with a sirocco adc and then written to an exabyte tape .",
    "the siroccos and the tape drive are housed in a vme data acquisition ( daq ) system .",
    "this allowed limited on - line analysis .    for an event to be written to tape it had to satisfy the trigger conditions , namely that the event occurred during the beam extraction phase of the sps , the daq was not busy and finally , and most importantly",
    ", there were coincident hits in a number of the scintillators .",
    "the gallium arsenide detector tested was fabricated by alenia spa , rome .",
    "it had both 50@xmath0 m pitch and readout .",
    "the detector had an integrated si@xmath4n@xmath5 capacitor and novel biasing scheme to keep the detector strips close to zero volts .",
    "the capacitor was between two layers of metal , the lower was in contact with the substrate and was 30@xmath0 m wide and the upper was 20@xmath0 m wide .",
    "the cross - section of a detector and an illustration of the top of the detector are shown in figure [ fig : xsec ] .",
    "the gap between the biasing strip and the detector strip was 5@xmath0 m long and 6@xmath0 m wide .",
    "the thickness of the detector was 200@xmath0 m .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the noise observed in the test beam data and with the detector in the laboratory is over five times greater than expected ( 360e@xmath2 enc@xcite ) .",
    "the source of this excess noise will be investigated further .    by reducing",
    "the noise both resolution and detection efficiency will improve .",
    "the lack of resolution attainable with a given @xmath6 algorithm is proportional to @xmath7 @xcite . as seen in figure [ fig : det - eff ] , once the @xmath8 is above ten detection efficiency should not be a problem .    at the lhc gallium arsenide detectors",
    "will be aided by the faster shaping times of the pre - amplifiers , as 80% of the signal will be delivered within 20ns .    currently under investigation",
    "are non - minority carrier injecting ohmic contacts which will enable detectors to be more easily `` over - depleted '' .",
    "this will increase the charge collection efficiency of the detectors and hence the signal produced .",
    "studies to be made in 1995 include varying the gap / metal width ratio , response at lower temperatures and keystone detector geometry",
    ". in varying the gap / metal width the signal will decrease ( due to poorer field ) but the resolution will increase . since silicon detectors may require an operating temperature of -10@xmath9c to prevent reverse annealing the gallium arsenide response at lower temperatures needs to be checked .",
    "it is planned to use detectors with keystone geometry in the atlas forward region so detectors must be fabricated in this design to prove their viability .",
    "off - line software was originally written by r. turchetta , j.a .",
    "hernando and j.a .",
    "straver , to all of whom the authors are greatly indebted .",
    "a. rudge and r. boulter also provided exceptional technical support ."
