    "in this section we define the standard model of elementary particles ( sm ) by introducing the particle content and the parameters of this model .",
    "we aim at giving a short introduction , at illustrating how this model is used , and at discussing ( some of ) its merits and limitations ( to go deeper in the subjects touched , one could make reference to the seminal papers on the sm @xcite , to books and reviews @xcite , and to the particle data group biannual report @xcite ) .",
    "there are two groups of spin 1/2 particles , quark and leptons , divided in 4 groups with different values of the electric charge @xmath0 @xmath1 ( respectively named : e- , mu- and tau - neutrinos ; electron , muon , tau ; up , charm and top quarks ; down , strange and bottom quarks ; recall the existence of their _",
    "anti_-particles , with opposite charge ) .",
    "a different mass distinguishes among the three particles in each group ( neutrino masses are to a certain extent special , and we will discuss them in a few pages ) .",
    "thence , the fundamental particles can be arranged in three `` families '' , with increasingly heavier members  but otherwise identical .",
    "free quarks have never been observed .",
    "it is thought that they can manifest as such only in very energetic processes ; and that they necessarily bind to form the `` hadrons '' @xmath2 the binding is provided by `` strong '' interactions , a prerogative of the quarks ; the forces between nuclei are regarded as residual strong interactions .    actually , the list of _ stable _ spin 1/2 particles is even shorten than the above ones ; the electron , the proton @xmath3 ( perhaps ) , the neutrinos ( perhaps ) .",
    "then come the integer spin fundamental particles , that have the special role of _ mediating _ the interactions :    * the graviton ( spin 2 ) related to forces ( that , strictly speaking are not part of the sm ) ; * the gluon @xmath4 ( spin 1 ) that carries interactions ; * the photon @xmath5 ( spin 1 ) that carries interactions ; * the @xmath6 and @xmath7 bosons ( spin 1 ) that originate ( current ) interactions ( responsible for instance of the nuclear @xmath8 decays  with emission of electrons ) ; * and finally the higgs boson ( a scalar , with spin zero ) that mediates interactions ( see below ) .",
    "the last one is a hypothetical particle ; however it has an outstanding importance in the sm .",
    "there is a concept that underlies the theory of spin 1 interactions : the gauge principle @xcite ( which can be given an essential role in formulating the theory of gravity , too ; and perhaps , the one of yukawa interactions  but this is already a speculation ) .",
    "we will introduce it , starting to venture in the formalism .",
    "let us consider the equation that describes the free propagation of a relativistic spin 1/2 particle : @xmath9 \\psi(x)=0.\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{({\\sc dirac } equation)}\\ ] ] here , @xmath10 is the mass of the particle ; @xmath11 are @xmath12 matrices that guarantee the covariance of the equation ; @xmath13 has 4 components , necessary to describe the spin of a massive particle ( thenceforth named : 4-spinor ) .",
    "the spinorial index and @xmath14 describe the `` space - time '' transformation properties of @xmath15 if we add more indices , we can construct equations that are covariant under other symmetries . to be specific ,",
    "let us consider the transformation @xmath16 where we parameterise @xmath17 by introducing the `` generators '' @xmath18 : @xmath19 ( the imaginary unity @xmath20 in the equations above are just due to the tradition ; it is important instead to recall that the number of generators is a characteristic of the group of symmetry ; 1 for u(1 ) , 3 for su(2 ) , 8 for su(3 ) , etc ",
    "su(@xmath21 ) being the group of unitary matrices of dimension @xmath21 with unit determinant ) .",
    "the symmetry consist in the fact that the trasformed spinor still obeys the dirac equation ( = the equation is `` covariant '' under the transformation ) ; and this is easy to prove , since neither the mass nor the @xmath5-matrices are transformed .    however , in consideration of the local character of the space - time , one is lead to wonder whether _ local _ symmetries @xmath22 also hold true .",
    "one readily verifies that the dirac equation is not covariant in this enlarged context , due to the fact that the partial derivative @xmath23 ( that describes how the particle propagates in the space - time ) _ do act _ on the parameters of the transformation .",
    "the `` gauge principle '' consists in insisting on covariance , by modifying the dirac equation in the following manner : @xmath24 \\psi(x)=0 \\\\[3ex ] \\displaystyle a^b_\\mu t^b \\to u a^b_\\mu t^b u^{-1 } -\\frac{i}{g}\\ u   \\frac{\\partial u^{-1}}{\\partial x^\\mu }   \\label{exex } \\end{array}\\ ] ] we introduced a parameter ( `` coupling '' ) @xmath25 and a set of fields labelled with space - time index @xmath26 ( that transforms as a 4-vector = that describes a spin 1 particle ) ; the indices @xmath27 are not indicated explicitly and a sum over @xmath28 is understood .",
    "different group of symmetries , different particles .",
    "note that in the special case of the u(1 ) symmetry group , only one particle @xmath29 must be introduced , and due to the commutativity in the group , it has simple transformation properties since @xmath30 identifying @xmath4 with the electron charge _",
    ", @xmath31 with value of the charge in unities of _ e _ , it becomes evident that the u(1 ) theory is just the electromagnetism . for",
    "non - commutative groups ( say , su(@xmath21 ) , where @xmath32 in general ) , instead , one notes that these spin-1 particles transform in a non trivial manner _ also _ under global ( non - local ) transformations , exactly due to the @xmath33 term .",
    "then , it comes without surprise the fact that these particle interact not only with the matter fermions ( quarks and leptons ) but also among themselves ; however , this fact is of great significance , since it means that the `` superposition principle '' of ordinary electromagnetic interactions ( `` the light does not interact with the light '' ) is not of general validity .",
    "now we can appreciate the first foundation of the standard model , namely , its gauge group @xmath34 the sign @xmath35 means that the three subgroups commute ( = they do not communicate among them  neither they do , incidentally , with the space - time symmetries ) .",
    "the su(3)@xmath36 part is related to the existence of gluons , the rest ( `` electroweak '' group ) to the photon and the spin 1 bosons related to weak interactions .",
    ".quark and leptons assignment in the sm .",
    "@xmath37 is the su(3)@xmath36 index .",
    "the su(2)@xmath38 `` doublets '' can be decomposed as : @xmath39 and @xmath40 last column gives the value of @xmath41 this structure is just replied for the other two families of matter fermions.[tab:1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     how matter fermions behave under this group ?",
    "the assignment is done in a visibly asymmetric manner ( see table [ tab:1 ] ) , since the `` left '' and `` right '' spinors have different behaviours ( even worser : only the `` left '' neutrino is assumed to exist  an ontological asymmetry ) . with the adjectives `` left '' and `` right '' , we refer to the most elementary objects that describe particles with spin 1/2 , called ( weyl ) 2-spinorssu(2)@xmath42su(2)@xmath43 ( the symbol `` @xmath44 '' means that the two algebr  are the same , and the indices `` @xmath45 '' and `` @xmath46 '' distinguish the two copies of su(2 ) ) .",
    "we perceive then the close analogy with the usual group of rotations , so(3)@xmath44su(2 ) ( relation familiar from quantum mechanics ) .",
    "the representations of the lorentz group can be then labelled by a pair of integers @xmath47 the smallest non - trivial ones , @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote left and right 2-spinors respectively . both of them",
    "are needed to construct a dirac spinor . ] .",
    "the `` left - right '' asymmetric assignment of the elementary particles in the sm accounts for a peculiarity of the weak interactions , the violation of the parity reflection symmetry .",
    "the generator of electric charge is the sum of the third su(2)@xmath38 generator and of the u(1)@xmath50 ( hypercharge ) generator @xmath51 : @xmath52 by using table [ tab:1 ] and previous equation , one can check that left and right states couple with the same charge @xmath0 to the photon , as it should be for parity to be conserved in electromagnetic interactions ( the same is true for the gluons ) . at this stage",
    ", we introduced 3 gauge couplings @xmath53 @xmath54 and @xmath55 one parameter each gauge subgroup .",
    "-1 cm    the elementary interactions can be conveniently represented as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gc ] .",
    "each of these plots corresponds to a certain `` feynman rule '' ( elementary diagram ) , that are used to calculate the amplitudes of probabilities of the admitted physical processes .",
    "for instance , the feynman rule of the first plot ( quark - quark - gluon ) tells us the presence of a @xmath56 coupling constant , and other factors related to the spin structure , too ; it corresponds actually to the term of interaction between @xmath57 and @xmath58 in equation trying to resemble the notation of section [ sec : gp ] ( and what is shown in the feynman rule ) we can illustrate this as an `` elementary reaction '' @xmath59 we warn however that this can not be considered as an actual reaction ( due to energy non - conservation ) but only as _ an element _ of a reaction . ] [ exex ] . joining the elementary diagrams in the admitted manners ( matching the type of lines ) one obtains the list of the possible processes in terms of `` feynman diagrams '' .",
    "feynman diagrams are in fact a very convenient manner to organise the actual computation ; in the following , however , we will use them mostly to illustrate the content of the theory , and not to perform computations .",
    "all this story of symmetries and interactions is beautiful , but there is an high price to pay for that :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ no mass is allowed , exactly due to @xmath60 ( standard model ) gauge invariance ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    -2 cm      here we come to the second foundation of the sm .",
    "the masses arise in a completely particular manner : through a _ symmetry breaking ascribed to the vacuum _",
    "more specifically , it is postulated that a scalar su(2)@xmath38-doublet exists ( the higgs boson ) , with hypercharge @xmath61 and it obtains a vacuum expectation value : @xmath62\\neq 0\\ ] ] this hypothesis is not as strange as it might sound , since it is a rather common situation in physics of condensed matter , _",
    "e.g. _  a spontaneous magnetisation breaks the rotational symmetry . in consequence of this assumption ,",
    "the electroweak invariance is lost ( only the electric charge symmetry remains untouched ) , and the @xmath63 and @xmath7 bosons acquire mass .",
    "also , by introducing 9 new parameters between the higgs boson and the quarks and leptons ( yukawa couplings ) , one can account for their masses .",
    "see figure [ fig : yc ] , and note the left - right structure of the couplings of quarks and leptons ( dirac type mass , like the one in section [ sec : gp ] ) .",
    "the only communication between different families in the sm arises at this point , and involves _ only _ the charged weak currents , to explain this well , it is necessary to go into some subtleties .",
    "( 1 ) the particles that have interactions with the @xmath64 are only the doublets , @xmath65 and @xmath66 so we have interaction structures like @xmath67 however , ( 2 ) ( as we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : yc ] ) the particles with definite mass require to match left and right quark ( lepton ) states , namely , @xmath68 should match with @xmath69 and similarly for @xmath70 quarks and charged leptons .",
    "so , these two are different prescriptions , or in other terms there is a clash between the `` interaction eigenstates '' and `` mass eigenstates '' .",
    "normally , people refer to mass eigenstates ( _ e.g. _ the top ; the electron ; _ etc . _ ) ; thence charged currents _ must _ be non - diagonal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ckm ] ) . for leptons",
    ", the absence of neutrino masses implies that the non - diagonality is just formal ( of no physical significance ) : _ e.g. _ @xmath71 is by definition the state associated to the electron by charged weak currents .",
    "-.4 cm    we are close to the end of the list of parameters , and we must introduce now the self - interaction of the higgs particle ( scalar potential ) : @xmath72 with two parameters , @xmath73 ( the higgs boson self - coupling ) and @xmath74 ( the vacuum expectation value , as it should be clear ) . notice that we omitted to list an additive constant ; this has no dynamical meaning if gravity is ignored , otherwise , it should be identified as ( a contribution to ) the vacuum energy , and we know by sure that this is quite small in comparison with the `` natural '' scale @xmath75 gev/@xmath76 ! ! !",
    "actually , there are still some more parameters , related to the non - abelian gauge bosons ( one for su(3)@xmath36 and one for su(2)@xmath38 ) that formally can be written as interaction terms like @xmath77 while the one related to su(2)@xmath38 is considered harmless , the one related to su(3)@xmath36 poses serious problems for phenomenology ( `` strong cp '' problem @xcite ) , and thence has to be small .",
    "we will not list these in the following , but we have to stress that these are very delicate and mysterious points of the sm ; surely they indicate ( some of ) its frontiers .",
    "let us summarise the content of the model by some counting .",
    "the number of matter fermions for family is 15 , 3 leptons , and 4 quarks which come in three types ( `` colour '' ) .",
    "three families , 45 matter particles .",
    "then there are 9 massless spin 1 bosons ( photon and gluons ) , and three that are massive instead .",
    "the number of parameters is @xmath78 these are all the fundamental parameters theory on a discretized space - time ( _ lattice _ ) . ]",
    "that are compatible with the requisite of `` renormalizability '' . in short",
    ", this means `` calculability '' of the theory ; in more diffuse terms , a theory of quantised fields ( that represent particles ) is termed renormalizable when the quantum fluctuations ( referred as `` loops '' , in connection with their representations by feynman diagrams ) produce relatively harmless infinities , namely only those that can be re - absorbed in the parameters of the theory .",
    "so a non - renormalizable theory must be modified to become consistent , for instance : + ( 1 ) adding new parameters ( no need in the sm ",
    "well , apart from three more of them , the @xmath79 parameters and the cosmological constant , that we brutally set to zero ) ; + ( 2 ) or new fields ( _ e.g. _  if only left electrons were to exist , the electromagnetic theory would be inconsistent due to so - called quantum anomalies ; a right handed electron cures this problem .",
    "more complex is the case of electroweak interactions , but due to a conspiracy of all the particles in a family , no such trouble exists ) ; + ( 3 ) or sometimes , it is necessary to reinterpret the theory as a non - fundamental one ( _ e.g. _  effective 4 fermion interactions result when a virtual @xmath64 boson is exchanged between two pairs of them ; but a 4 fermion fundamental interaction , in itself , would be _ not _ renormalizable ) . + the proof that the sm is renormalizable is not simple , however , gauge invariance turns out to be a crucial ingredient for that @xcite .    -.5",
    "cm    the list of successes of the sm is impressivly long ; broadly , can be divided in those related to strong interactions ( with few parameters ) and those of electroweak interactions ( with several parameters ) .",
    "we will limit here to _ two _ of them , that are of rather non - trivial nature ( for a full account , books and reviews should be consulted ) : + * ( 1 ) electroweak precision measurements * + due to the assumption that the higgs particle is a doublet , the scalar potential has a special structure , that ensures a relation between the @xmath64 and @xmath80 masses and the gauge couplings of the su(2)@xmath38 and u(1)@xmath50 groups ( @xmath54 and @xmath81 ) at the lowest order : @xmath82 this relation would not hold , for instance , if the higgs boson were in the `` triplet '' representations of su(2)@xmath83 this argument suggests that the hypothesis of `` doublets '' is correct , at least in first approximation . actually , there are calculable corrections to this relation due to `` loop '' effects , which increase the left - hand side by : @xmath84 @xmath85 is the typical loop factor .",
    "these calculations have been first made by veltman @xcite ; the predictions have been verified at lep and other experiments ( see for instance the reviews in @xcite ) .",
    "what we want to emphasise is that a new parameter , the top mass , enters into the game , so that precise measurements of @xmath86 @xmath87 and of the coupling constants give informations on the top mass , _ even if we were to ignore that the top quark existed  _",
    "-th level , @xmath88 depends on the intermediate @xmath89-th levels , even if we do nt see them directly . ] .",
    "similarly , by this method it is possible to get some information on the higgs boson mass .",
    "the sensitivity is only logarithmic , much weaker than the one to the top mass , however present data are precise enough to show an indication for a relatively light higgs boson ( assuming that this is the only new particle that contributes ) . + * ( 2 ) neutral currents * + as we saw , in the sm it is possible to change the family only at the price of emitting a charged spin 1 boson ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ckm ] ) .",
    "however , by a combination of two charged currents , it is possible to have an _ effective _ neutral current transition with change of family . the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcnc ] gives in fact an amplitude for electromagnetic dipole transition , with a dipole @xmath90 of the size @xmath91 ( @xmath92 is an adimensional loop function @xcite ) . beside the crucial electroweak ingredient , to obtain the correct quantitative estimate it is necessary to consider gluonic corrections @xcite",
    "; so , it is rather remarkable such a transition ( @xmath93 ) has been observed , and with a rate that agrees with the one predicted in the sm transition would be of enormous importance .",
    "the existence of this transition is actually predicted in extensions of the sm , like in simple supersymmetric models . ] .",
    "the sm has also some weak points ; we saw the large number of parameters , the undetected higgs particle ( that will be discussed further later on ) , and the replica of the fermions in three families should be added to the list .",
    "but the _ fatal _ failure seems to be the following one : neutrinos are predicted to be massless , while experiments operated in underground sites suggest that they are massive @xcite .",
    "this rigidity of the sm is due to the global symmetries it has symmetry is broken _ in the sm _",
    "@xcite ( @xmath94 is not a gauge symmetry , however ! ) .",
    "this breaking is manifest when the symmetry su(2)@xmath38 gets restored , and this has interesting cosmological consequences ( _ e.g. , _  a pre - existing leptonic asymmetry can be converted into the observed baryonic asymmetry ) .",
    "a more detailed discussion is in the contribution of auriemma . ] : a strict conservation of the total number of quarks ( equivalent to the `` baryon number '' @xmath28 ) ; and also of the number of leptons of each family ( conservation of the `` family lepton numbers '' @xmath95 the sum being called _ the _ lepton number @xmath45 ) . in the language of feynman diagrams",
    ", this means that quark lines are not turned into lepton lines ( or _ viceversa _ ) ; and that the arrows in the fermionic lines never clash .",
    "the problem of massive neutrinos is very urgent in our view , and will be discussed further in the following .",
    "however , another very evident ( and , perhaps , deeper ) limitation of the standard model of elementary particles is that gravity is not included .",
    "this has to do with the fact that quantising gravity turned out to be a very difficult problem .",
    "anyhow , it is rather reasonable to think that the model of elementary particle would look rather different at the planck scale @xmath96 gev .",
    "there are ideas on how to search for manifestations of quantum gravity by using ultra - high energy cosmic rays ev , which could be related with the @xmath5 s with @xmath97 ev coming from cosmological distances .",
    "see also the contributions of blasi , petrukhin and stanev .",
    "note that the center of mass energies ( @xmath98 ) for cosmic ray proton - proton collisions are 2 tev at the `` knee '' , 70 tev at the `` ankle '' and 200 tev for uhecr s : all three exceed the energies of present accelerators . ] ; also , one imagines that a proper understanding of black holes would require to make further steps toward a full theory of gravity .",
    "the concerns regarding the status of the cosmological constant stem from similar considerations .",
    "in the following , we focus on massive neutrinos @xcite , in consideration of the urgent character of the problem they pose for the sm , and also because certain reasonable answers can be offered . after a first harsh ( `` phenomenological '' ) approach , we will consider more refined and satisfying ( `` theoretical '' ) answers ; ideas like existence of `` right - handed '' neutrinos , `` quark - lepton symmetry '' and `` grand unification '' will be introduced . at the end , we will come back to higgs particle and to related arguments for supersymmetry at the weak scale .",
    "it is not possible to introduce masses of neutrinos in the sm .",
    "however , it is possible to write neutrino masses with 2-spinors only ; instead than the usual structure @xmath99 one can use @xmath100 in the sense that the role of the right state can be played by the _ anti_-neutrino : this is what is called majorana mass .",
    "( for reappraisal , one sees that this step is forbidden , unless one admits that the symmetry u(1)@xmath50 is violated , since particles and anti - particles have opposite charge  with feynman diagrams",
    ", one says that this mass term produces clashing arrows ) . here",
    ", we postpone the problem of theoretical justification , and simply assume the existence of majorana neutrino mass terms .",
    "these can be arranged in a mass matrix @xmath101 which is symmetric , and thence can be decomposed as follows : @xmath102 @xmath103 are the three neutrino masses ; @xmath104 is the mns ( after maki , nakagawa and sakata @xcite ) unitary mixing matrix , analogous to the ckm matrix ( and with the same number of physical parameters ) ; and @xmath105 are the so - called `` majorana '' phases ( two of them having physical meaning ) .",
    "all in all , we have 9 new physical parameters .",
    "now we have to face the question ; what is actually known from neutrino experiments ? as reviewed by kajita and stanev in this conference , there is evidence that _ neutrinos oscillate _ , as suggested by pontecorvo @xcite .",
    "the relevant experiments can be conceptualised in three main steps ; the _ production _ of a neutrino state , its _ propagation _ , and finally its _",
    "detection_. the states produced and detected are the `` interaction eigenstates '' , that however need not coincide with the `` mass '' , or more in general with the `` propagation eigenstates '' . in more precise terms , a neutrino generated by weak interactions ( say , a @xmath106 tagged by a @xmath26 produced in association ) is supposed to be a superposition of propagation eigenstates , @xmath107 ; if the masses of neutrinos are different , these states propagate differently ; thence , a subsequent detector could reveal a _ disappearance _ of the original neutrino @xmath108 ( or the _ appearance _ of a new type neutrino , say @xmath109 ) .",
    "this is described by _",
    "probabilities _ of survival ( or of conversion ) whose entities depend on the neutrino mixing and the differences of masses squared .",
    "so : ( 1 ) atmospheric neutrinos inform us on one squared mass difference and one mixing angle ( these results can be regarded as indication of @xmath108 disappearance ; super - kamiokande gives also indications of @xmath109 appearance _ via _ neutral currents events ) ; ( 2 ) solar neutrinos inform us on another ( squared ) mass difference and another mixing angle ( this results can be regarded as @xmath71 disappearance ; neutral current signals can be seen by super - kamiokande and sno detectors _ together _ ) .",
    "so , there are 5 parameters that are simply unknown at present .",
    "they are    1 .",
    "the mixing between @xmath71 and the state responsible of atmospheric oscillations , @xmath110 2 .   a phase that can cause cp violating oscillations ( included in @xmath111 ) ; 3 .   the mass of the lightest neutrino ; 4 .   the majorana phases @xmath112    we have plenty of choice of what to study next",
    "however , difficulties are not lacking , too ...      let us discuss the parameters of the previous list .    _",
    "( 1 ) _ the first parameter is bound by the chooz experiment to be small , @xmath113 ( actually , the bound depends to a certain extent on the mass differences ) .",
    "in fact , there are some theoretical arguments suggesting that this parameter is even smaller , at the level of @xmath114 these will be discussed in section [ sec : ql ] .",
    "so , the effects on oscillation probabilities could be quite tiny and would be not possibly found even after refining cosmic ray neutrino experiments .",
    "actually , it seems rather difficult that present generation of long - baseline experiments will achieve sensitivity to such a small value ( compare with the report of scapparone for this conference ) .",
    "a completely different possibilities is offered by the detection of a type - ii supernova , since the neutrino burst are substantially affected by the presence of even such a small value of @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "_ ( 2 ) _ as for the cp violating phase , it is rather difficult to foresee the perspectives of measurement at the present stage .",
    "it seems to us that success could be possible only if the solar neutrino problem has relatively large values of the mass difference ( `` large angle mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein '' solution @xcite  see contribution of kajita ) ; this possibility could be tested by the kamland experiment which aims at detecting neutrinos from distant reactors .    _ ( 3 ) _",
    "the most sensitive tool to the lightest neutrino mass is the search of anomalies in the endpoint spectra of @xmath8 ( = electron ) emitters with low @xmath0-value , since in that kinematical regime the mass of the neutrino emitted in association becomes relevant .",
    "the experimental searches ( troitsk , mainz ) bound the mass of this neutrino to be below the few ev range ( theoretically , it is not excluded that the actual value is close to this one ; in that case , however , oscillation experiments would force the conclusion that the spectrum is almost degenerate , which does not sound particularly appealing ) .",
    "note that close type - ii supernovas could give some information on this parameter , too . also , cosmological considerations give valuable information on massive neutrinos as sub - dominant components of the universe ( assuming of course that the main components and the dynamics are well understood ) , since the big - bang picture suggests the existence of a sea of _ relic neutrinos _ , a close relative of the cosmic microwave ( photon ) background . in passing ,",
    "we have to say that it is very hard to conceive other ( non - gravitational ) tests of the _ relic neutrinos _ hypothesis .    _",
    "( 4 ) _ the majorana phases are very - very difficult to measure directly .",
    "actually , the only handle of which we are aware is a rather indirect one , namely a measurement of these parameters in combination with other ones , which could be possible observing the neutrinoless-@xmath116 decay ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nlbd ] ) . in this transition ,",
    "a nucleus increases its charge by two unities , by emitting two electrons simultaneously .",
    "if detected , this transition could inform us on the size of @xmath117 which depends _ also _ on the majorana phases .",
    "the uncertainties in the description of nuclear effects could limit quantitatively the precision of our inferences ; however , a detection of this transition would be of great significance , since it would strongly suggest that neutrino have majorana type mass : oscillation experiments can not help do this .",
    "the present limit on @xmath118 has been obtained by the heidelberg - moscow collaboration and is in the @xmath119 ev range .",
    "-1 cm    however , even in the optimistic assumption all the unknown quantities we discussed will be measured , it is evident that one of the parameters of the neutrino mass matrix will remain ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "now , we discuss some ( theoretically ) respectable extensions of the standard model , with massive neutrinos and in general with new physics .",
    "we start considering the higgs boson @xmath121 and the left - leptons @xmath122 , that have the same gauge numbers , @xmath123 ( notation as in table [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "an admitted interaction must be invariant , so the product @xmath124 seems to be ok .",
    "but it is the space - time structure that is not ok , since combining a spinor and a scalar we do not obtain an invariant .",
    "one simple solution is to introduce a new fermion @xmath125 with no gauge numbers , and construct @xmath126 the answer we get is rather obvious : we just introduced something that must be called `` right - handed '' neutrino , and we obtained a yukawa interaction completely analogous with quark or charged leptons yukawa terms ( this term alone would originate what is called a dirac mass for neutrinos ) .",
    "but we learned that @xmath127 has no gauge interactions , so for consistence we must consider the invariant @xmath128 too ( = majorana mass for the right - handed neutrino ) .",
    "these two elements give rise to the famous `` see - saw '' model for the masses of the left - neutrinos @xcite ( which is majorana in type ; the name comes from the fact that , the more the right - handed neutrino masses go up , the more the left - neutrino masses go down ) : see fig .",
    "[ fig : ss ] .    -0.7",
    "cm    it should be noted that , even if the right - handed neutrino has super - heavy mass and can not be produced at accelerators , it still leaves its footprints in the masses of left - neutrinos .",
    "the generated mass can be regarded _",
    "effectively _ as a @xmath129 term ; it reveals its non - fundamental nature from the fact that it is not renormalizable ( one can draw here a very close analogy with the 4 fermion weak interactions ) .",
    "note that the number of parameters is still enlarged ! however , some of these parameters might have some interesting manifestations , for instance they can generate a leptonic asymmetry in the early universe @xcite",
    ".    there is at least one alternative possibility that we feel should be mentioned : if , in order to obtain majorana masses for neutrinos , we directly multiply two leptonic doublets , we find the quantum numbers @xmath130 thence , by postulating a triplet scalar @xmath131 with u(1)@xmath50 charge @xmath132 we can construct the invariant term @xmath133 and if we give a _ tiny _ ( see eq .  [ eq : rho ] and discussion therein ) vacuum expectation value to the neutral component of the triplet , we find again majorana masses .",
    "so , the question arises , which of these ( or other ) mechanism for massive neutrinos is the correct one ?",
    "this is very difficult to answer convincingly , and it could be considered a frontier of the `` theory beyond the sm '' !",
    "we proceed in the presentation of promising ideas , and pass to the concept of _ grand unification _ @xcite .",
    "the existence of right - handed neutrinos  whose interest has been already discussed  can be argued on the basis of quark - lepton symmetric spectrum ( even if the majorana mass of the right - handed neutrinos is by itself a point of asymmetry ) .",
    "this hypothesis becomes compulsory if we assume that the sm is a group of residual symmetry of certain `` unification groups . ''",
    "we just present few examples and limit ourselves to illustrate how the matter fermions ( and the right - handed neutrinos ) fit in the representations of larger groups : + * su(5)*. ( georgi - glashow ) this group of @xmath134 matrices obviously includes su(3)@xmath36 and su(2)@xmath38 as the upper @xmath135 and lower @xmath136 blocks , while u(1)@xmath50 is in the diagonal .",
    "the representations where the matter fermions sit are : @xmath137 ( 1,2,3 are the index of su(3)@xmath138 the * 10 * matrix is antisymmetric ) . in this context",
    ", the right - handed neutrino has the same status as in the sm . + * su(4)@xmath35su(2)@xmath42su(2)@xmath139 * ( pati - salam ) .",
    "this group is very satisfying as for the quark - lepton symmetry .",
    "the fermions are assigned to : @xmath140 ( note the presence of right - handed neutrinos ) .",
    "leptons , in a sense , are just the fourth type of quarks . for us is difficult to see this , and maintain the opinion that it has no meaning .",
    "one could consider a weak point of this assumption the fact that there are three different ( non - unified ) gauge subgroups ( however , by imposing a parity that relates @xmath45- and @xmath46-subgroups this improves ) .",
    "+ * so(10 ) * ( georgi , fritzsch - minkowski ) .",
    "this group includes su(5 ) ( since a complex 5 vector can be obviously mapped in a real 10 vector ) but also the pati - salam group ( since so(6)@xmath44su(4 ) ) .",
    "each family of matter fermions sits in a single representation : @xmath141 like su(5 ) , this group has an unique coupling .",
    "however , the breaking of so(10 ) down to the sm might take place in several steps ( with several `` intermediate '' scales) .. 3 cm    whatever the gauge group , it is needed that the large gauge symmetries are broken ( and also that the fermion masses are generated ) .",
    "this calls for scalars , and opens up many possibilities ( and troubles , see section [ sec : troub ] ) .",
    "we mention only one specific point here @xcite .",
    "as we saw , the so(10 ) or pati - salam group naturally includes right - handed neutrinos , which is certainly a good thing .",
    "however , the reduction of su(2)@xmath139 symmetry typically requires the existence of scalar `` right '' triplets ; the symmetry forces the existence of `` left '' triplets ; so that , there are two competing sources for massive neutrinos : see - saw and `` left '' triplet .",
    "apart from neutrino masses , the unification groups have ( some ) predictivity on the _ unification of gauge couplings , _ _ of fermion masses , _ and also on _ proton decay_. from the experimental point of view , the last aspect is surely the most interesting .",
    "proton decay could be due to the new gauge bosons of the grand unified group , that permit communication between quarks and leptons ; however there are also other possibilities , _ e.g.",
    "_  new scalar particles might have an important role ( this happens commonly in supersymmetric models ) . trying to summarise in a few words the present situation :",
    "proton decay is not experimentally found ( strongest limits come from the super - kamiokande experiment ) but there are some theoretical models that offer hopes of detection for future detectors ( new detectors like icarus have superior properties , but its _ mass _ might limit its discovery potential ... should a mega - kamiokande be built ? ) .",
    "experimental and theoretical proposals , however , are still at a stage of discussion ; the `` future '' seems not close .      here , we present an _",
    "ansatz _ for massive neutrinos , that we consider quite reasonable since it is based on a principle : quark - lepton symmetry ( or more precisely , quark - lepton correspondence ) .",
    "one starts to note that the masses of up - type quarks increase strongly changing family , in comparison with what happens for down type quarks , or also for charged leptons .",
    "this difference of hierarchies motivate the assumption that neutrinos have still weaker differences among them .",
    "an actual implementation of this idea , due to sato and yanagida - plets of second and third families ( that contain @xmath26 and @xmath142 neutrinos ) do not pay - off hierarchy factors ; while this always happen for @xmath143-plets . ]",
    "@xcite , is the assumption that the neutrino mass has the structure : @xmath144 ( where the cabibbo angle @xmath145 is a parameter of the ckm matrix ) . to make the statement sufficiently vague ( or equivalently , sufficiently precise ) one postulates that the elements of the matrix include also _ coefficients order unity _ ( these are in fact are essential in order to generate three different neutrino masses ) .",
    "+ the weak points of this assumption are that : + ( 1 ) the overall scale is not predicted ; + ( 2 ) the hierarchy of masses between the two heavier neutrinos tends to be rather weak .",
    "+ the advantages ( after the weak points are made up , by adjusting the unknown `` coefficients '' and the overall scale ) are that : + ( 1 ) a large mixing for atmospheric neutrinos is automatic ; + ( 2 ) there is a prediction of `` large angle mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein '' solution ( with the correct type of mass hierarchy ) ; + ( 3 ) the value of @xmath146 is predicted to be small . + note , incidentally , that also neutrinoless @xmath116 transitions are predicted to be suppressed , since @xmath147 this is essentially a manifestation of the fact that neutrinos are supposed to obey a sort of family hierarchy , and is tightly related to the suppression of @xmath148 since @xmath149      -1 cm    here we come to one trouble of the sm ( even more severe in the unified theories ) .",
    "this is , in essence , a _ problem of hierarchy of scales _",
    "one can say that , due to quantum fluctuations , heavy masses creep in the higgs boson ( @xmath44 weak boson ) scale and want to destabilise it .",
    "for instance , the diagram in the fig .",
    "[ fig : hp ] changes the coefficient of the bilinear term @xmath150 by an amount of the order of @xmath151 which ( apart for the loop pre - factor ) seems to produce a huge scale , comparable to @xmath152 ( not of the order of the electroweak scale as we need ) . to be picky",
    ", one can say that the individual contributions to @xmath153 are not separately measured ; that only their sum has physical meaning ; and that we should not ask the theory to say more than it can .",
    "however , in this manner we would most probably give up any chance of _ predicting _ these fundamental parameters , since a hypothetical ( more complete ) theory would be forced to explain a very precise fine - tuning .",
    "this situation motivated several extensions of the sm , and all of them have new physics ( close ) at the electroweak scale ; for instance , it was postulated that the higgs particle is not fundamental  but instead a pion - like object ( _ technicolor _ ) .    we will concentrate the discussion on _ supersymmetric _ models @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry is an extension of the space - time group , which relates fermions and bosons by a symmetry transformation . in the models that could be possibly relevant for electroweak scale physics , supersymmetry commutes ( = is unrelated ) with the gauge group",
    "; so that any ordinary particle obtains a `` partner '' , and we have scalar electrons ( sleptons ) , fermionic gluon ( gluino ) , _ etc . _ actually , it is necessary that the number of higgs doublets is at least _",
    "we recommend to make reference to the contributions of ganis and denegri for a more detailed description of these models , and discussion of the perspectives of confirmation .",
    "the connection with the `` hierarchy problem '' is due to an amazing property of supersymmetry as a quantum field theory : that the `` loops '' involving bosons and fermions compensate each other , and contributions like those in eq .",
    "[ hhh ] . at this point",
    ", however , we have to recall that an extension of the sm should have _ broken _ supersymmetry in order to be realistic ( otherwise , for instance , the `` partners '' would have the same mass of the ordinary particles ) .",
    "the actual mechanism for supersymmetry breaking is an open question at present , which surely is not a nice feature , even if there are reasonable proposals .",
    "however , if one assumes that the breaking scale is order of the tev , and restricts the allowed breaking terms to so - called `` soft - breaking '' , the quantum properties are maintained and the hierarchy problem is under control . in this paragraph , we presented an instant summary of the idea of `` supersymmetry at the weak scale '' .",
    "much more could be said , however , the key question that we have to answer is : do these considerations have any relevance to the description of nature ?",
    "let us list three considerations that suggest ( but not `` imply '' ) an affirmative answer :    -.7 cm    * * electroweak precision measurements suggest the existence of a light higgs particle as predicted in ( minimal ) supersymmetric extensions of the standard model*. + the prediction is mainly due to the fact that the higgs boson self - coupling @xmath73 in eq .",
    "[ ooqqoo ] turns out to be a combination of the ( measured ) electroweak gauge constants ( the scalar potential is quite constrained in these models ) .",
    "this prediction can be tested at future colliders ( ... or if we are really lucky , even before ; see denegri , these proceedings ) . * * gauge couplings unify in the context of low energy supersymmetric model .",
    "* + here we mean that : the extrapolation of the couplings is compatible with the hypothesis of grand unified dynamics ( broken below a certain scale @xmath154 see fig .",
    "[ fig : gu ] ) @xcite .",
    "this does not happen in the ordinary sm ( not within a model with a single scale of breaking ) .",
    "it is rather remarkable that the large unification scale , @xmath155 gev , is comparable with what is suggested by a see - saw mechanism for massive neutrinos .",
    "can proton decay provide the crucial confirmation of this indication ?",
    "specific channels exist @xcite , like @xmath156 the presence of a kaon ( the characteristic aspect ) results from the fact that proton decay is expected to be due to yukawa type interactions , and to observe for this reason the family hierarchy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spd ] ) .",
    "however , the dependence on the unknown aspects of the model is strong ( and no doubt that the usual yukawa sector already challenges our understanding ) , and , theoretically , it is not excluded that the proton decay process is rather suppressed .",
    "+ -1 cm * * a cold dark matter candidate exists . * + the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable due a discrete symmetry that can be incorporated in the model ( which , for the record , is called r parity ) .",
    "is the galactic `` lsp cloud '' @xcite responsible of the modulated signal seen in the dama experiment shown by incichitti at this conference ?",
    "if this were true , this result would be of enormous importance , not only for the direct detection of dark matter but also as a first signal of `` supersymmetry at the electroweak scale '' ; and it would also open quite interesting perspectives for future collider searches , as discussed by ganis .",
    "further studies and confirmations are of essential importance ( incichitti ) .",
    "we would like to add a comment on the higgs boson mass .",
    "a value on the large side ( say , @xmath157 gev ) would indicate in a supersymmetric context a rather strong hierarchy between the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , @xmath158 this would suggest an entire series of theoretical and phenomenological questions ; for example , the ( yukawa type ) proton decay is expected to be enhanced in this regime . instead",
    ", if the higgs boson mass turns out to be really large ( say , @xmath159 gev ) it seems not easy to avoid the conclusion that `` supersymmetry at the electroweak scale '' is in trouble ; this will be the crucial test of the model .",
    "finally , we remind that in the sm there is a limit on the higgs boson mass suggested by the consideration that the self - coupling @xmath73 should be not driven negative as an effect of the quantum fluctuations , ( `` vacuum stability '' @xcite ) at least up to the planck scale where new effects most probably appear .",
    "it is rather funny , but this _ lower _ limit almost coincides with the _ upper _ limit in the ( minimal ) supersymmetric extension of the standard model . so ( if a joke is permitted ) we present a prediction for lhc : @xmath160 the reason is that this value will increase the entropy in the minds of several theorists . note , however , that the decay of a standard and supersymmetric higgs particles with the same mass ( or also the production rate``cross - sections '' ) could be rather different ; thence , these measurements would offer a possibility to distinguish between the sm and its supersymmetric extension even in this tricky case .",
    "we would like to close this pages by spending few words of caution , to remind that failures of the standard model have been often claimed in the past years ( today , several of them are considered dubious or simply wrong tracks ) .",
    "here is an arbitrary selection : @xmath161 is there any moral behind these stories ?",
    "maybe not ; however : + 1 ) they suggest to go slowly and carefully from data to theories and back ( because of possible pitfalls of interpretation , of suggestion , _ etc . _ ) ; + 2 ) they witness how hard is to reach the frontiers of standard model ; and , also , how strong is the desire of particle physicists to find them !",
