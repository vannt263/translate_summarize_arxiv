    "it is commonly known that , according to the first law of dynamics , in the absence of an external force , every object remains in rest or moves along a straight line with uniform velocity .",
    "the aforementioned law is valid under the assumption that the mass of the object in question is constant . in many textbooks ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and dedicated papers ( see e.g.  @xcite ) the problem of variable mass bodies or systems was thoroughly analyzed .",
    "however , in all the examples it is assumed that an influx or efflux of mass is a uniformly changing function of time . in order to fill the gap we focus here on the dynamics of an oscillating mass object .",
    "it turns out that the study of behavior of such a body brings forward interesting physical results and consequences .",
    "let us consider an object with an initial mass of @xmath0 and its mass is some function of time @xmath1 .",
    "additionally , we assume that there is no external force acting on the body ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the equation of motion in this case can be written down in the form @xmath3 from which it clearly follows that @xmath4 .",
    "now , since mass varies with time , we find that @xmath5 substituting eq .",
    "( [ mfv ] ) into ( [ p ] ) we get that @xmath6 the product in the second term of lhs of eq .",
    "( [ fgen0 ] ) may be equal to zero only if the first term vanishes . under the initial assumption that the mass changes in time , it happens only if @xmath7 . rearranging the terms in eq .",
    "( [ fgen0 ] ) we immediately arrive at the equation @xmath8 or if we utilize eq .",
    "( [ mfv ] ) we get @xmath9 as we can see , in case @xmath10 we observe no acceleration and therefore we obtain the classical equation of motion of a body upon which no external force is acting ( @xmath11 )",
    ". however , in all other cases the acceleration turns up that is proportional to the mass change ratio .",
    "it also should be stressed here that , in general , the acceleration @xmath12 is not constant in time .",
    "in this section we deal with a massive object whose mass oscillates in time .",
    "the choice of such a mass function is due to a sound assumption that energy should be conserved in time , i.e. an influx and efflux of energy are then compensated .",
    "it also means that the mass of the body remains constant if averaged over an integer number of oscillations .    here",
    "we assume the mass function to be of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an amplitude of oscillations and @xmath15 , and hence @xmath16 substituting eqs .",
    "( [ mf ] ) and ( [ mfder ] ) into ( [ af ] ) we get that @xmath17     given by eq .",
    "( [ acc ] ) ( solid ) vs.  @xmath18 function ( dashed ) .",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 were assumed here.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the acceleration function given by eq .",
    "( [ acc ] ) is significantly similar to a cosine function , and therefore resembles the oscillatory motion in which acceleration of a body is described by such a function . by integrating eq .",
    "( [ mfv ] ) in which the mass function @xmath23 is given by eq .",
    "( [ mf ] ) we get the solution of the equation of motion in the form @xcite @xmath24 the function described by eq .",
    "( [ xft ] ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the same initial conditions and values as in fig .",
    "it is clearly noticeable that this type of motion is periodic , however it bears no resemblance to the regular oscillatory motion .",
    "it can also be easily checked that for @xmath25 eq .",
    "( [ xft ] ) turns into well - known formula @xmath26 .",
    "as we have shown , in the absence of an external force applied to a body it is possible that the body will accelerate provided its mass changes with time . except for the rest reference frame ,",
    "an observer notices non - zero acceleration of the body .",
    "the example directly indicates that the acceleration of an oscillating mass body is similar to the case of a classical oscillator , however the solution of the equation of motion reveals a significant difference from the oscillatory motion",
    ". these results may be important for many - body systems in which mass is exchanged between particles or bodies . in view of the aforementioned facts it may also be a contribution to a comprehension of quantum null oscillations on a classical ground by applying the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xmath27 which states that the energy ( and mass ) of the system is not _ strictly _ conserved and therefore serve as an attempt to establish a common ground for classical and quantum mechanics ."
