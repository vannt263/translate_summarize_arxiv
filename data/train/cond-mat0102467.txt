    "the last decade has seen a great interest in quantum dots , i.e. little islands of electron gas confined by an artificial potential ( see ref .",
    "one of the most challenging proposals concerning qd is the idea of using the electron spin in quantum dots as the basic information carrier ( the qubit ) in a quantum computer ( see , for example , ref .",
    "quantum logic gates between these qubits are effected by allowing the electrons to tunnel between two coupled quantum dots . for the application of coupled quantum dots as a quantum gate ,",
    "it is important that the coupling between the spins can be switched on and off via externally controlled parameters such as magnetic field and interdot distance . in the recent paper of g.burcard et",
    "al.@xmath1 the spin interaction for two laterally coupled _ isotropic _ qd defined in a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) was calculated as a function of these external parameters and it was shown that the interaction @xmath0 can be switched on and off with exponential sensivity to that parameters . in the present paper , we consider a different setup consisting of two laterally coupled _ anisotropic _ quantum dots with a magnetic field applied perpendicular to that 2des ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "we especially interested in calculation of interaction @xmath0 as a function of anisotropy of the qd since our proposal is to switch on and off the interaction @xmath0 by changing shape of the qd , e.g. by applying gate voltage to each quantum dot .",
    "we note that in the setup being proposed in ref . @xcite it was assumed that the interdot distance is controlled by varying the barrier height between the qd . in real experimental setup varying",
    "the barrier height might lead to changing shape of the qd from circular to elliptic .",
    "also , probably in future quantum computers based on large integrated circuts of qd it will be simplier to change shape of the qd ( and , in case of neceserrity , interdot distance ) , than change interdot distance alone , preserving circular shape of the qd .",
    "this is one of the reasons which motivated our study .    in order to study",
    "coupled anisotropic quantum dots , one needs to find firstly the eigenstates of a single electron in a single anisotropic quantum dot in a magnetic field .",
    "the latter problem is of fundamental interest in mesoscopic physics .",
    "surprisingly , it seems that this important problem was not solved so far .",
    "the eigenstates of a single two - dimensional electron confined by a radial potential of the form @xmath2 with a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the system are called fock - darwin states .",
    "that system was investigated by fock@xmath3 and darwin@xmath4 a long time ago .",
    "the system where an electron is confined by an anisotropic potential of the form @xmath5 was studied only recently by a.v .",
    "madhav and tapash chakraborty.@xmath6 their studies were motivated , in particular , by the experiments on anisotropic quantum dots ( see ref .",
    "they obtained energy eigenvalues of the system , but not the eigenfunctions of it . in their paper , the transformation of coordinates and momenta of the system was performed . in the new hamiltonian , variables are separated and one can easily obtain both the energy eigenvalues and the eigenstates of the system . however , in order to obtain the eigenstates of the system in old ( initial ) coordinates , one needs to transform the eigenfunctions of the new hamiltonian .",
    "it was not done in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the section ii of the present paper",

    "the question is how one can return back to coordinates ( x , y ) , i.e. how to obtain eigenstates @xmath22 of the hamiltonian ( [ openh ] ) .",
    "since @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 we have the following formula for the eigenstates @xmath22 : @xmath26 let us denote @xmath27 .",

    "@xcite ) . we rewrite the hamiltonian , adding and subtracting the potential of the single left ( right ) dot for electron 1(2 ) in @xmath94 .",
