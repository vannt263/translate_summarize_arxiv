    "in the framework of supergravity the reheating temperature of inflation should be low enough to avoid overproduction of gravitinos  @xcite .",
    "the new inflation model  @xcite generally predicts a very low reheating temperature and hence it is the most attractive among many inflation models  @xcite .",
    "however , the new inflation suffers from a fine - tuning problem about the initial condition ; i.e. , for a successful new inflation , the initial value of the inflaton should be very close to the local maximum of the potential in a large region whose size is much longer than the horizon of the universe .",
    "a framework of a double inflation  @xcite was proposed to solve the initial value problem of the new inflation model .",
    "it was shown that the above serious problem is naturally solved by supergravity effects if there exists a preinflation ( e.g. , hybrid inflation  @xcite ) with a sufficiently large hubble parameter before the new inflation  @xcite .    in this double inflation model ,",
    "density fluctuations produced by both inflations are cosmologically relevant if the @xmath3-fold number of the new inflation is smaller than @xmath4 ( the total @xmath3-fold number @xmath4 is required to solve flatness and horizon problems in the standard big bang cosmology  @xcite ) . in this case , the preinflation should account for the density fluctuations on large cosmological scales [ including the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) scales ] while the new inflation produces density fluctuations on smaller scales .",
    "although the amplitude of the fluctuations on large scales should be normalized to the cobe data  @xcite , fluctuations on small scales are free from the cobe normalization and can have arbitrary power matched to observations . in ref.@xcite , a cosmological implication of the double inflation for the large - scale structure formation was discussed . in this paper , we study primordial black hole ( pbh ) formation in the double inflation model . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the production of black hole macho was investigated in the double inflation model for a special case . here",
    ", we consider a wide range of parameter space where pbhs are formed .",
    "the upper bound of @xmath5 is not rigorous but much heavier black holes can be produced in the present model if we take the appropriate model parameters .",
    "however , the mass of the black holes should be less than the galactic mass @xmath6 , otherwise the power spectrum conflicts the observations ( e.g. distribution of galaxies ) .",
    "the lower bound @xmath7 comes from the requirement that @xmath3-fold number of the new inflation should be larger than @xmath8 . ] .",
    "in particular , we show that the double inflation creates small pbhs evaporating now if those pbhs are produced during matter - dominated ( md ) era , i.e. , before the end of reheating process after the new inflation .",
    "we stress that these evaporating pbhs may account for antiproton fluxes observed by the bess experiment  @xcite .    throughout this paper the gravitational scale ( @xmath9 gev ) is taken to be unity .",
    "in a radiation - dominated ( rd ) universe , pbhs are formed if the density fluctuations @xmath10 at horizon crossing satisfy a condition @xmath11  @xcite , where @xmath12 is the over density at the horizon scale .",
    "masses of the black holes @xmath13 are roughly equal to the horizon mass , @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the total cosmic density , temperature , and statistical degrees of freedom at the horizon crossing , respectively .",
    "the horizon length at the black hole formation epoch ( @xmath18 ) corresponds to the scale @xmath19 in the present universe given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the temperature of the present universe .",
    "the comoving wave number corresponding to this length scale , @xmath22 , is @xmath23 thus , we can write the pbh mass as a function of comoving wave number as @xmath24    the mass fraction @xmath25 of pbhs of mass @xmath26 is given by  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mass variance at the horizon crossing .",
    "notice that the mass fraction @xmath29 drops off sharply as @xmath30 decreases .",
    "the density of the black holes of mass @xmath26 , @xmath31 , is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the entropy density .",
    "since @xmath34 is constant at @xmath35 , we estimate the density parameter @xmath36 of the black holes in the present universe as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the present hubble constant in units of 100  km / sec / mpc . we write it as a function of pbh mass or pbh",
    "scale as @xmath39 or @xmath40    as for the mass of the pbhs produced during the rd era , we have a lower limit @xmath41 .",
    "the mass of pbh produced at the reheating epoch is given by [ see eq.([bh - mass ] ) ] @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the reheating temperature .",
    "as seen later @xmath43 is less than @xmath44gev in our inflation model , and hence @xmath41 is larger than @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the pbhs lighter than @xmath41 should be produced during the md era .    in a md universe , a relation between the comoving scale @xmath19 and the horizon mass @xmath26 is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the comoving scale of the horizon at the reheating epoch .",
    "thus , the mass @xmath26 of the pbh produced during the md epoch is given by @xmath48 we see that small pbhs of mass , @xmath49 for example , would be produced for @xmath50gev and @xmath51mpc@xmath52 .",
    "the condition for the pbh formation in a md universe is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the mass fraction of pbhs of mass @xmath26 is estimated as  @xcite @xmath53 notice that the mass fraction has a weeker dependence on @xmath54 than in the rd case [ see eq.([bh - frac ] ) ]    during the md era , the mass fraction @xmath55 stays constant and hence the density of the black holes of mass @xmath26 , @xmath31 , is given by @xmath56 we can write the present density parameter @xmath36 for the black holes of mass @xmath26 as @xmath57",
    "we adopt a double inflation model proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the model consists of two inflationary stages ; the first one is called preinflation and we take a hybrid inflation  @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) as the preinflation .",
    "we also assume that the second inflationary stage is realized by a new inflation model  @xcite and its @xmath3-fold number is smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the density fluctuations on large scales are produced during the preinflation and their amplitude should be normalized to the cobe data  @xcite . on the other hand , the new inflation produces fluctuations on small scales . since the amplitude of small scale fluctuations is free from the cobe normalization , we expect that the new inflation can produce large density fluctuations enough to form pbhs .",
    "we choose the predicted power spectrum to be almost scale invariant ( @xmath58 ) on large cosmological scales which is favored for the structure formation of the universe  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the new inflation gives the power spectrum which has large amplitude and shallow slope ( @xmath59 ) on small scales .",
    "thus , this power spectrum has a large and sharp peak on the scale corresponding to a turning epoch from the preinflation to the new inflation , and we expect that pbhs are produced at that scale .    as for the detailed argument of the dynamics of our model , see refs.@xcite .",
    "first , let us briefly discuss a hybrid inflation model  @xcite .",
    "the hybrid inflation model contains two kinds of superfields : one is @xmath60 and the others are a pair of @xmath61 and @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 is the grassmann number denoting superspace .",
    "the model is based on the u@xmath64 symmetry under which @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the superpotential is given by  @xcite @xmath67 the @xmath68-invariant khler potential is given by @xmath69 where the ellipsis denotes higher - order terms which we neglect in the present analysis for simplicity .",
    "we gauge the u@xmath70 phase rotation:@xmath71 and @xmath72 . to satisfy the @xmath73-term flatness condition",
    "we take always @xmath74 in our analysis .",
    "we define @xmath75 as the @xmath3-fold number corresponding to the cobe scale and the cobe normalization leads to a condition for the inflaton potential , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the inflaton potential obtained from eqs.([superpot - pre ] ) and ( [ kahlerpot - pre ] ) . in the hybrid inflation model ,",
    "density fluctuations are almost scale invariant ; @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a spectral index for a power spectrum of density fluctuations .",
    "now , we consider a new inflation model .",
    "we adopt an inflation model proposed in ref .",
    "the inflaton superfield @xmath80 is assumed to have an @xmath68 charge @xmath81 and u@xmath82 is dynamically broken down to a discrete @xmath83 at a scale @xmath84 , which generates an effective superpotential  @xcite , @xmath85 the @xmath68-invariant effective khler potential is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a constant of order @xmath88 .",
    "we require that supersymmetry breaking effects make the potential energy at a vacuum vanish , and we have a relation between @xmath84 and the gravitino mass @xmath89 as ( for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath90 the inflaton @xmath91 ( the scalar component of @xmath92 ) has a mass @xmath93 in the vacuum with @xmath94 the inflaton @xmath95 may decay into ordinary particles through gravitationally suppressed interactions , which yields reheating temperature @xmath96 given by is discussed in ref.@xcite ] @xmath97 an important point on the above density fluctuations is that it results in a tilted spectrum with spectral index @xmath98 given by ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath99      the crucial point observed in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the preinflation sets dynamically the initial condition for the new inflation .",
    "we identify the inflaton field @xmath101 with the real part of the field @xmath91 .",
    "it gets an effective mass @xmath102 during the preinflation  @xcite .",
    "thus , this inflaton @xmath100 tends to the potential minimum , @xmath103 notice that @xmath104 deviates from zero due to the presence of a linear term @xmath105 ( see ref .",
    "thus , at the end of the preinflation the @xmath100 settles down to this @xmath104 .",
    "after the preinflation , the universe becomes md because of the oscillation of the inflaton for preinflation . during the md era between the two inflations , the energy density scales as @xmath106 , and the new inflaton oscillates around @xmath107 with its amplitude decreasing as @xmath108 .",
    "since the scale factor increases by a factor @xmath109 during this era , the mean initial value @xmath110 of @xmath100 at the beginning of the new inflation is written as @xmath111 therefore , the amplitude of fluctuations with comoving wavelength corresponding to the horizon scale at the beginning of the new inflation is given by @xmath112^{-3/2 } \\left [      \\left ( \\frac{\\mu}{v } \\right)^{4/3 } \\right]^{-3/4 } %    \\simeq \\frac{h_{\\rm pre}}{3^{1/4}2\\pi }       \\left(\\frac{v}{\\mu}\\right)^{2 } ,    \\label{eq : q - fluctuation}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 is the hubble parameter during the hybrid inflation , @xmath114 .",
    "the fluctuations given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : q - fluctuation ] ) are a little less than newly induced fluctuations at the beginning of the new inflation [ @xmath115 ) ] .",
    "moreover , the fluctuations produced during the preinflation are more suppressed for smaller wavelength .",
    "thus , we assume that the fluctuations of @xmath100 induced in the preinflation are negligible compared with fluctuations produced by the new inflation . as mentioned before",
    ", the new inflation gives the tilted spectrum on small scales [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : new - index ] ) ] and hence the fluctuations at the scale corresponding to the beginning of the new inflation is dominant .",
    "now let us estimate @xmath3-fold number which corresponds to our current horizon .",
    "the @xmath3-fold number is given by  @xcite @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a potential energy when a given scale @xmath118 leaves the horizon , @xmath119 that when the inflation ends , and @xmath120 energy density at the time of reheating .",
    "we take @xmath121 , and @xmath122 . for @xmath123 ( i.e. , the present horizon scale )",
    ", we have @xmath124 in estimating @xmath75 we must take into account the fact that the fluctuations induced at @xmath3-fold number less than @xmath125 before the end of the hybrid inflation reenter the horizon before the new inflation starts .",
    "such fluctuations are cosmologically irrelevant since the new inflation produce much larger fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath75 is given by @xmath126 the cobe normalization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cobe - cond ] ) should be imposed by using this @xmath75 .",
    "we estimate density fluctuations in the double inflation by calculating evolution of @xmath100 and @xmath54 numerically . for given parameters @xmath87 and @xmath127",
    ", we obtain the break scale @xmath128 and the amplitude of density fluctuations produced at the beginning of new inflation @xmath129 . here , @xmath130 is the comoving scale corresponding to the hubble radius at the beginning of the new inflation ( a turning epoch ) .",
    "we can understand the qualitative dependence of @xmath131 on @xmath132 as follows : when @xmath87 is large , the slope of the potential for the new inflation is too steep , and the new inflation can not last for a long time .",
    "therefore , the break occurs at smaller scales . as for @xmath129",
    ", we can see from eq.([eq : cobe - cond ] ) that as @xmath127 gets larger , @xmath133 also gets large .",
    "in addition , we can show that @xmath134 for a given @xmath84 ( see ref .",
    "thus , we have larger @xmath129 for larger @xmath127 .",
    "our double inflation model predicts the amplitude of density fluctuations @xmath129 as a function of inflation parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the black hole abundance is expressed as a function of mass variance @xmath54 at the time when the corresponding scale enters the horizon .",
    "therefore , when we compare the observations with the prediction of our model , we need a relation between the mass variance @xmath54 and the fluctuations @xmath129 .    for the power spectrum with the break scale @xmath130 which enters the horizon during the rd epoch",
    ", we have a relation between the mass variance and the amplitude of fluctuations as was used . ]",
    "@xmath135 ( the numerical factor depends on the tilted spectral index @xmath136 , and within the parameter range we consider , this factor lies between @xmath137 . ) . for the power spectrum with the break scale @xmath130 which enters the horizon during the md epoch",
    ", we have a relation between the mass variance and the amplitude of fluctuations as @xmath138 ( again , the numerical factor depends on the tilted spectral index @xmath136 , and within the parameter range we consider , this factor lies between @xmath139 . ) .",
    "first , let us consider pbh dark matter with @xmath140 which are produced during the rd epoch . since the density fluctuations at the break scale is dominant , and the mass fraction @xmath55 has a sharp peak at that scale , only the pbhs of mass corresponding to the break scale are formed .",
    "for pbhs produced during the rd epoch ( after reheating process ) , we have , from eq .",
    "( [ omega - rd - mass ] ) , @xmath141 for example , if we require that the black holes with mass @xmath142 ( @xmath143machos ) be dark matter in the present universe , i.e. @xmath144 , we obtain @xmath145 , and from eq.([bh - frac ] ) we obtain @xmath146 from eq.([sigma - delta - rd ] ) , we see that the break amplitude is @xmath147 , and we find from eq.([mass - scale - rd ] ) that the break scale is @xmath148 . in fig.[fig :",
    "dm - pbh ] , we plot the numerical results of our double inflation model for @xmath149 , and @xmath150 .",
    "we see a wide range of parameter space which may account for dm ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "next , let us consider another interesting mass range of pbhs which are evaporating now ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "the pbhs of such light mass are produced during the md epoch and from eq.([omega - md ] ) we find @xmath153 it has been reported , recently , that the bess experiment  @xcite has observed antiproton fluxes , which may be explained by the evaporation of pbhs if @xmath154  @xcite . in order to explain the bess result by evaporating pbhs we need @xmath155 from eq.([reheat - temp ] ) , we estimate the required fraction of the evaporating pbhs as @xmath156 since the mass variance @xmath30 scales as @xmath157  @xcite during the md epoch , we obtain the mass variance at the break scale as @xmath158 and the amplitude @xmath159 is @xmath160 and @xmath161 . in fig.[fig : bess - pbh ] , we plot an example of the numerical results of our double inflation model , we do not find a consistent parameter region with the bess experiment . ] for @xmath162 , and @xmath163 .",
    "as shown in the figure , we have a set of inflation parameters @xmath164 ) which may account for the bess experiment .",
    "in this paper we have studied the formation of pbhs by taking a double inflation model in supergravity .",
    "we have shown that in a wide range of parameter space pbhs are produced of various masses .",
    "these pbhs are interesting since , for example , they may be identified with machos ( @xmath165 ) in the halo of our galaxy . or",
    ", they may be pbhs which are just evaporating now ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "such black holes are one of the interesting candidates for the sources of antiproton fluxes recently observed in the bess detector  @xcite .    the dark matter pbhs play a role of the cold dark matter on the large scale structure formation .",
    "the scales of the fluctuations for pbh formation themselves are much smaller than the galactic scale and thus we can not see any signals for such fluctuations in @xmath167 measurements . however , the pbhs may be a source of gravitational waves . if the pbhs dominate dark matter of the present universe , some of them likely form binaries .",
    "such binary black holes coalesce and produce significant gravitational waves  @xcite which may be observable in future detectors .",
