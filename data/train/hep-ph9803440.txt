    "recent results on atmospheric neutrinos @xcite show a deficit in the number of @xmath0induced events that can be interpreted as a consequence of neutrino oscillations . additional signals of @xmath6oscillations come from solar neutrinos @xcite and from the lsnd experiment @xcite .",
    "these results , if all interpreted in terms of oscillations , require three independent values of the parameter @xmath7 , seem to imply the existence of a least four neutrino mass eigenstates @xcite and therefore , given the limits on the number of flavors of standard neutrinos @xcite , the existence of at least one sterile state .    the energy and zenith angle distributions of the electron  like events detected by super ",
    "kamiokande @xcite are in agreement with the montecarlo prediction without oscillations ; at the same time , the results of the chooz experiment @xcite put stringent limits on @xmath0@xmath1 mixing in the region of @xmath7 of interest , therefore the hypothesis of @xmath8 oscillations as explanation of the atmospheric neutrino data is disfavored ( see @xcite and @xcite for a more quantitative discussion ) .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino data can be explained by the existence of @xmath9 or @xmath10 oscillations , where @xmath11 is a sterile neutrino .",
    "the possibility that the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is due to @xmath0@xmath11 mixing has been previously discussed in @xcite , and more recenty in @xcite .",
    "bounds on the existence of sterile states with large mixing to the standard neutrinos have been obtained from cosmological considerations @xcite . for large enough values of the mixing angle and @xmath7",
    ", the oscillations of standard into sterile neutrinos can bring the sterile states in ( or close to ) thermal equilibrium with matter before the nucleosynthesis epoch .",
    "the increase in the energy density results in the overproduction of primordial helium , spoiling the success of big bang nucleosynthesis . schramm and turner @xcite , have estimated the upper limit ( at 95 % c.l . ) on the number of light degrees of freedom at nucleosynthesis as @xmath12 .",
    "this bound , according to the analyses in @xcite , is incompatible with the explanation of the atmospheric neutrino problem as due to the mixing betwen muon and sterile neutrinos , because the allowed region in the oscillation parameter space would result in @xmath13 .",
    "however recent work @xcite has shown that this cosmological bound can be evaded , considering the suppression of oscillations due to the possible presence of a lepton asymmetry in the early universe that can be generated by the oscillations themselves .",
    "it is interesting to investigate if the data on atmospheric neutrinos already existing or to be collected in the near future can discriminate between these two different hypotheses for oscillations .",
    "the energies of atmospheric neutrinos are such that only a very small fraction is above the threshold for @xmath14lepton charged current ( cc ) production , on the other hand the neutral current ( nc ) cross sections of @xmath15 and @xmath0 are identical .",
    "sterile neutrinos instead , by definition , do not interact even by neutral currents . in principle",
    "the presence of a flux of tau neutrinos can therefore be identified as an excess of nc over cc events .",
    "the measurement is possible in large mass detectors like super  kamiokande ( sk ) .",
    "the most promising method , as recently discussed by smirnov and vissani @xcite , is the study of the reaction @xmath16 where a single @xmath17 is produced , and detected after its decay @xmath18 .",
    "the absolute value of the cross section for this process is not known with great accuracy , because it has only been measured with large errors @xcite and it is difficult to compute theoretically @xcite .",
    "part of this uncertainty should cancel @xcite when comparing with the rate of single pion events produced in charged  current interactions .",
    "experimentally one will need to know with sufficient accuracy the acceptance and efficiency for the detection of events with at least two ` tracks ' in the final state .",
    "another handle to distinguish the @xmath0@xmath15 and @xmath0@xmath11 mixing is given by the fact that the energy and zenith angle dependence of the oscillation probabilities are different in the two cases because of the presence of matter effects @xcite . in this work",
    "we discuss in detail this possibility , examining the effects that could be observed both in the events induced by neutrino interactions in the detector and in the upward going muons , generated by neutrino interactions in the rock beneath the detector .",
    "as we will show , the most promising tool to disentangle matter effects should be provided by the study of upward going muons , notwithstanding the present confusing experimental situation .",

    "the effective mixing in matter becomes maximal ( msw resonance effect @xcite ) when the condition @xmath59 is satisfied .",

    "the analyses of the sub  gev and multi  gev data in terms of neutrino oscillations suggest for @xmath65 a value in the range @xmath66  ev@xmath5 , therefore matter effects are essentially negligible in the sub",

    "the composition remains always close to the value @xmath67 , but the density is not constant growing from a value of @xmath68  g  @xmath69 at the surface to @xmath70  g  @xmath69 close to the center .",
    "therefore the effective oscillation parameters are not constant , and the flavor conversion probabilities must be obtained integrating the flavor evolution equation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_prob_a ] we plot the survival probability of muon neutrinos as a function of the zenith angle , in the case of maximal mixing with tau , electron and sterile neutrinos .",
    "we are assuming that the neutrinos are created in a pure @xmath0 state at the surface of the earth , and observed when they emerge again from the earth after traveling a distance @xmath71 ( @xmath72  km is the earth radius ) . in each panel",
    "the curves correspond to the survival probability of a neutrino with energy @xmath73 , 40 , 60 and 80 gev if @xmath74  ev@xmath5 .",
    "the oscillation probability is a function of @xmath75 and the same curves describe the probabilities for different values of @xmath7 with a suitable rescaling of the values of the energy .",
    "the upper panel shows the vacuum probabilities ( appropriate for @xmath0@xmath15 mixing ) , that are sinusoidal curves of constant amplitude and oscillation length linearly growing with @xmath56 . in the middle and lower panel the survival probability for @xmath8 and @xmath60 oscillations are plotted .",
    "the most remarkable feature to note is the fact that for large @xmath56 the curves take an approximately constant shape , with minima at fixed values of the zenith angle , but with an amplitude that decreases as @xmath76 . in the case of @xmath8 oscillations ,",
    "the asymptotic shape of the transition probability has four maxima at @xmath77 , 0.76 , 0.90 and 1 . in the case of oscillations into sterile neutrinos",
    "the large energy transition probability has two maxima , a broad one at @xmath78 and a sharper and slightly higher one at @xmath79  @xcite .",
    "we can note that in the lower panel the curve labeled 20 , that refers to a value @xmath80  gev / ev@xmath5 , is still of an ` intermediate ' shape , between the vacuum oscillation form and the asymptotic shape of the highest energies ; in the @xmath81 case where the matter effects are stronger ( @xmath82 ) the corresponding curve has a shape closer to the asymptotic one .    to understand qualitatively these patterns in the oscillation probability it is useful to consider briefly propagation in a medium with constant density and composition . in this ideal case",

    "these are qualitatively exactly the main features present in the middle and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_prob_a ] .    for a fixed value of @xmath88 ,",
    "the large energy limit of the oscillation probability in vacuum is readily obtained from eq .",
    "( [ prob - vacuum ] ) as : @xmath89 comparing equations ( [ prob - asymp - matter ] ) and ( [ prob - asymp - vacuum ] ) , we note that they differ because in the presence of matter the dependence on the distance @xmath88 has a characteristic oscillating form instead of a quadratic increase . in the case of @xmath0@xmath11 mixing",
    "the asymptotic oscillation length varies between 23,000  km ( at the surface ) and 5,300  km ( at the earth s center ) , that corresponds to 3.65 and 0.81 earth radii , respectively ; for @xmath0@xmath1 , @xmath90 is a factor of two shorter .",
    "this remarkable coincidence between the oscillation length of high energy @xmath0 s mixed with electron or sterile neutrinos when traversing the earth and the geometrical radius of our planet , generates a characteristic and observable deformation of the zenith angle distribution of the high energy neutrinos coming from below the horizon .",
    "the considerations that we have outlined have been developed for constant density , but the qualitative conclusion that for large @xmath56 the curve of the oscillation probability as a function of zenith angle reaches an asymptotic shape remains valid also in the presence of variable density and composition . in this more general case",
    "the shape is not exactly sinusoidal ; for example one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig_prob_a ] that the maxima of the oscillation probability become narrower for neutrino trajectories that pass close to the center of the earth where the density is higher and the oscillation length shorter .",
    "we note that the density of the earth has a sharp discontinuity at a radius @xmath91  km , the boundary between the mantle and the core , where the density jumps from 5.5 to 9.9  g  @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "a simple description of the density of the earth as composed of two layers of constant density with a discontinuity at @xmath92 , is adequate to describe most of the features of the oscillation probabilities , as shown by the dashed curves @xcite in the figures .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_prob_b ] we show survival probability curves for the case of a vacuum mixing angle with @xmath93 .",

    "an msw resonance is present for the antineutrinos when the condition @xmath96 is satisfied , while the mixing in matter of the neutrinos is always suppressed with respect to the vacuum case . in the case @xmath97",
    "one should exchange the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "we can also note that asymptotically the shape of the oscillation probability as a function of zenith angle is the same as in the maximal mixing case , however at all energies the oscillation length of neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) is shorter ( longer ) than the maximal mixing case .",
    "the detection of the angular dependence of the oscillation probability is therefore more difficult if neutrino and antineutrino events are summed together .",
    "we discuss first the information that can be obtained from the events where the neutrinos interact in the detector via charged currents . in the presence of @xmath9 or @xmath60 oscillations ,",
    "the rate of muon  like events is reduced , and its zenith angle and energy dependence is deformed .",
    "the absolute value of the theoretical prediction @xcite has a large ( @xmath98% ) uncertainty that however to a good approximation affects in equal way the muon and electron ( anti)neutrino fluxes , and therefore cancels in the analysis of the ` double ratio ' @xmath99 .",

    "the result obtained in @xcite is that the regions allowed for @xmath0@xmath15 and @xmath0@xmath11 oscillations are very similar , with the second one only slightly smaller , because the lowest values of @xmath65 allowed for oscillations into @xmath14neutrinos are excluded in the sterile case  @xcite . in this work",

    "this follows from the facts that : ( a ) the matter effects , depending on the quantity @xmath107 , vanish at low energy ; ( b ) the atmospheric neutrino flux falls steeply with energy , and the rate of interactions of high energy neutrinos is small even for the large mass of super  kamiokande .    as an illustration in fig .",

    "for the higher momentum events ( @xmath115  gev , lower panels ) the muon direction is more tightly correlated with the parent neutrino ( @xmath116 ) , and the depletion of down  going events is much smaller .    the suppression of the rate in the case of @xmath0@xmath11 oscillations is smaller than in the @xmath0@xmath15 case , because the effective mixing is reduced by matter effects .",
