    "this talk briefly summarizes a growing body of work@xcite done with tom cohen on unstable baryon resonances in the @xmath0 qcd expansion .",
    "more in - depth synopses appear in ref .  .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion about the large @xmath1 qcd limit has been extensively used to study baryons treated as stable states . at @xmath2",
    "the lowest - lying baryons fill a completely symmetric spin - flavor su(6 ) representation , the * 56*. although the lightest @xmath3 baryons have @xmath1 valence quarks , the su(6 ) representation remains symmetric , as one shows@xcite by imposing order - by - order ( in @xmath0 ) unitarity in @xmath4 scattering ( _ consistency conditions _ ) .",
    "low - spin baryons in this multiplet ( analogues to @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) are split in mass at @xmath7,@xcite meaning that such states are stable for large @xmath1 .",
    "such analyses use a hamiltonian @xmath8 with asymptotic baryon eigenstates , which is expanded in su(6)-breaking operators accompanied by powers of @xmath0 .",
    "baryon resonances , on the other hand , generically lie above the ground - state multiplet by an @xmath9 mass gap ; since mesons like @xmath10 have @xmath9 masses , such states are generically unstable against strong decay . while treating excited multiplets like the arbitrary-@xmath1 analogue of the su(6 ) * 70 * using a hamiltonian approach has produced many interesting phenomenological results , such a treatment for resonances is not entirely reasonable since it entails grafting _",
    "ad hoc _ sources of @xmath11 pairs ( the production / decay mechanism ) onto @xmath8 , violating unitarity .",
    "moreover , resonances in such an @xmath8 are not manifested as excited states of stable baryons .    in fact , a resonance @xmath12",
    "is properly represented by a complex - valued pole in a scattering amplitude at position @xmath13 .",
    "such an approach can be developed using tools originally appearing in the context of chiral soliton models , for such models naturally accommodate baryon resonances as excitations resulting from scattering of mesons off ground - state baryons .",
    "they are consistent with the large @xmath1 limit because the solitons are heavy , semiclassical objects compared to the mesons .",
    "in contrast to quark models , chiral soliton models tend to fall short in providing detailed spectroscopy and decay parameters for baryon resonances , particularly at higher energies .",
    "nevertheless , one may use the scattering or soliton _ picture _ ( no specific model ) to study baryon resonances as well as the full scattering amplitudes in which they appear , and relate it for @xmath1 large to the hamiltonian or quark _ picture_.",
    "the relevant physical observables in real data are scattering amplitudes , in which resonances appear as complex poles .",
    "the role of large @xmath1 is to treat the ground - state baryon , off which mesons scatter , as a heavy field manifesting the consistency conditions .",
    "these conditions turn out to impose@xcite t - channel constraints : amplitudes with @xmath14 first appear at order ( both relative and absolute ) @xmath15 , leading to relations among the amplitudes holding at various orders in @xmath0 .",
    "the t - channel expressions may be reexpressed in the s channel using group - theoretical crossing relations , in which the @xmath16 rule becomes@xcite the statement that the underlying dynamical degrees of freedom are _ reduced amplitudes _",
    "@xmath17 labeled by @xmath18 , the eigenvalue of @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath20 partial waves of orbital angular momentum @xmath21 are    @xmath22    respectively , which are special cases of an expression@xcite that holds for ground - state baryons of arbitrary spin (= isospin ) and mesons of arbitrary spin and isospin .",
    "expressions like ( [ mpeqn1 ] ) are useful because full observable partial waves outnumber reduced amplitudes @xmath17 , giving rise to a number of linear relations among the measured amplitudes that hold at leading [ @xmath9 ] order .",
    "a pole in one partial wave implies a pole in one of the @xmath17 , which in turn contributes to several others partial waves .",
    "a single pole therefore generates a multiplet of baryon resonances degenerate in mass and width.@xcite moreover , the existence of an s - channel pole in an intermediate state can not depend upon the states used to form it ( except through conservation of quantum numbers ) , and so the resonant poles are labeled uniquely by @xmath18 .",
    "for example , eqs .",
    "( [ mpeqn1 ] ) applied to @xmath24 , @xmath25 states ( @xmath26 ) gives @xmath27 and @xmath28 , while in the @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) channel , @xmath32 ( parity being determined by @xmath21 ) .",
    "a pole in @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) implies a degenerate pole in @xmath35 , because the latter contains a @xmath36 amplitude .",
    "clearly , degenerate towers of resonances develop with @xmath37 , _ etc . _ on the other hand , one type of @xmath26 pole ( @xmath36 ) couples predominantly to @xmath10 and the other ( @xmath38 ) to @xmath39 .    in comparison ,",
    "the quark - picture large @xmath1 analogue of the excited multiplet @xmath40 has 2 @xmath26 and 2 @xmath31 states , just as for @xmath41 .",
    "one can show that the numerous nonstrange states in this multiplet have only 3 distinct mass eigenvalues out to @xmath9,@xcite which we label @xmath42 . comparing the quantum numbers and multiplicities of such states with the results of eqs .",
    "( [ mpeqn1 ] ) , one immediately finds@xcite that exactly the required resonant poles are obtained if each @xmath18 amplitude , @xmath43 , contains precisely one pole , located at the value @xmath44 .",
    "this quark - picture multiplet of excited baryons is found to be _ compatible _ with , _",
    "i.e. _ , consist of a complete set of , multiplets classified by @xmath18 .",
    "one can prove@xcite compatibility for all nonstrange baryon multiplets in the su(6)@xmath45o(3 ) shell picture , as well as for the whole @xmath40",
    "multiplet@xcite if @xmath46 poles are added .",
    "it is important to note that compatibility does _ not _ imply su(6 ) is an exact symmetry at large @xmath1 for resonances as it is for ground states ; rather , it says that su(6)@xmath45o(3 ) multiplets are complete but _ reducible _ at large @xmath1 . in the above example ,",
    "@xmath42 are split at @xmath9 and therefore label distinct multiplets",
    ". indeed , large @xmath1 by itself does not mandate the existence of _ any _ baryon resonances , but it does say that if even one exists , it must be a member of a well - defined multiplet .",
    "it is possible to obtain testable predictions for the decay channels , even using just the leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "for example , we noted that the @xmath47 @xmath26 resonance couples only to @xmath39(@xmath10 ) .",
    "indeed , the @xmath48 resonance decays to @xmath20 with a 3055@xmath49 branching ratio ( br ) despite lying barely above that threshold , while the @xmath50 decays to @xmath20 with only a 310@xmath49 br despite having much more comparable @xmath4 and @xmath20 phase spaces .",
    "this pattern clearly suggests@xcite that the @xmath10-phobic @xmath48 should be identified with @xmath51 and the @xmath39-phobic @xmath50 with @xmath52 , the first fully field theory - based explanation for these observations .",
    "similarly , the @xmath53 lies only 5  mev above the @xmath54 threshold but has a 1025@xmath49 br to this channel , and thus appears to lie in a @xmath55 su(3 ) octet with the @xmath48.@xcite large @xmath1 also provides@xcite su(3 ) selection rules : octet resonances preferentially produce @xmath10 and @xmath39 in their decays , while singlet @xmath56 s produce @xmath57 s .",
    "configuration mixing between states with 1 , 2 , _ etc .",
    "_ excited quarks , which requires an _ ad hoc _ treatment in the quark picture , naturally occurs in the scattering picture .",
    "if one finds two resonances of comparable mass and identical quantum numbers , and one has a natural broad @xmath9 width , can the other have a narrow @xmath7 width ? unless a conservation law forbids the mixing , both are expected to have @xmath58 .",
    "indeed , one can exhibit@xcite @xmath9 operators that allow such mixing .",
    "the mandate that resonances occur in multiplets applies not only to conventional but exotic baryons as well .",
    "for example , a state with the quantum numbers of the controversial @xmath59 ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) would necessarily have partners@xcite with @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 , degenerate in mass and width up to @xmath7 corrections .",
    "indeed , such a @xmath66 in an su(3 ) @xmath67 would have degenerate * 27 * and * 35 * partners as well,@xcite an enumeration matching that found in a quark picture calculation.@xcite    first - order @xmath0 corrections in amplitude relations like eqs .",
    "( [ mpeqn1 ] ) are handled@xcite ( at least in the nonstrange case ) simply by including @xmath68 amplitudes in the analysis and identifying linear relations surviving among the enlarged set of physical amplitudes .",
    "when confronted with data , relations obtained in this way are typically a factor @xmath2 better satisfied than those that only hold to @xmath9",
    ".    processes other than meson - baryon scattering can also be treated using the scattering approach , given only the @xmath69 and @xmath70 quantum numbers of the field coupling to the baryon along with the corresponding @xmath1 power suppression of each coupling .",
    "for example , each multipole amplitude in pion photoproduction can be expressed in this way,@xcite once the photon is divided into its @xmath71 and @xmath72 pieces .",
    "amplitude relations thus derived , including @xmath0 corrections , can be compared to data .",
    "the comparisons are favorable except in the resonant region , where the effects of finite @xmath0 splittings between resonances degenerate in the @xmath73 limit obscure agreement .",
    "in fact , the helicity amplitudes on corresponding resonances derived from such seemingly disparate amplitudes turn out to agree remarkably well with @xmath0",
    "expectations.@xcite    the most interesting unsolved problems using the scattering method involve a proper treatment of @xmath0 effects .",
    "first , the @xmath74 and its incorporation of @xmath0-suppressed amplitudes must be generalized to strange resonances .",
    "second , many spurious states arise when @xmath3 ; explaining how they decouple when @xmath1 is tuned to 3 will open a broad new front for phenomenological results .",
    "finally , a marriage of this approach with chiral symmetry ( straightforward because of the connection to soliton models ) will provide a very powerful additional set of physical constraints .",
